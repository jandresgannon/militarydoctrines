# DOCTRINE

### OF THE ARMED FORCES OF THE CZECH REPUBLIC


-----

-----

_The Doctrine of the Armed Forces of the Czech Republic (AFCR)_

_represents a new dimension of military professional thought in upgrading_
_security documents and other documents relating to the Czech Republic’s_
_reform of the armed forces. It stems from the knowledge and experience of_
_modern warfare. It constitutes the national framework for the AFCR’s basic_
_task – defense of its sovereignty and territorial integrity and fulfilling allied_
_commitments of the Czech Republic._

_The successful achievement of this basic task and other related tasks of_

_the AFCR depends, among others, on how well commanders understand the_
_natural pa�erns of contemporary combat and non-combat operations, and_
_their ability to skillfully and creatively apply those natural pa�erns to the_
_armed forces command and control._

_The aim of the AFCR’s doctrine is to create conditions for common_

_understanding of current combat principles, the likely character of future_
_operational environments and the AFCR force deployments under these_
_conditions. The purpose of the Doctrine of the AFCR is to provide military_
_professionals and political representatives of the CR a general framework for_
_planning and preparing the AFCR’s forces to conduct military operations in_
_peace, times of crisis, and in war. It is an official expression of AFCR strategic_
_thought._

_The Doctrine of the AFCR derives from the “Security strategy of the_

_Czech Republic” as a fundamental conceptual document of the state security_
_policy, from the “Military Strategy of Czech Republic,” and from fundamental_
_military-political and operational standards (military publications) of NATO_
_regarding principles and fundamentals consistent with military security of_
_the state and the North Atlantic Alliance. It generalizes experience gained_
_from combat and peace operations and combined exercises with NATO_
_armies in the past years. It answers the questions under what conditions will_
_the AFCR act and operate and under what conditions can the AFCR succeed._
_It applies to both combat and non-combatant deployments. It provides basic_
_theoretical grounds for practical application of the military use of force_
_across the full spectrum of threats to the CR or NATO state members. It_
_interconnects state defence political-strategic control level and command and_
_control of the AFCR with operational level (execution of concrete operations)_
_and has an influence on principles of the use and activities of deployed_
_operational formations._

_Understanding and creative application of the AFCR’s doctrinal content_

_requires relevant knowledge of NATO operational standards, particularly_
_allied publication Allied Joint Doctrine AJP-01 (B), December 2002, upon_
_which the AFCR’s doctrine is based._

#### CHAPTER 1

 GENERAL REMARKS


-----

#### GENERAL REMARKS

01. The Doctrine of the AFCR represents a summary of principles for

preparing and conducting operations in which the AFCR may be
involved within a multinational framework or independently.
It is a mutual doctrine of all AFCR forces. The AFCR doctrine
creates the hierarchical framework and bases for AFCR doctrinal
documents.

**Doctrinal pattern of the AFCR**

02. The AFCR’s doctrinal hierarchy is comprised of the Doctrine of

the AFCR, lower level doctrines and the scheme of service (de­
partmental) regulations, manuals and other documents intended
for training, preparation and possible deployment of individual
components of the AFCR or the AFCR as a whole. These do­
cuments have a hierarchical classification and are mutually
harmonized in terms of content and form. Their content includes
provisions of ratified doctrines and other NATO standards.

03. The content of the AFCR’s doctrine and other documents of

doctrinal pa�ern are authoritative for troops but they require
a personal approach during application.


_Generally, doctrine represents the summary of clear-cut opinions_
_on a specific subject. In the military environment it expresses_
_a system of fundamentals and principles which direct the activities_
_of armed forces when executing their military operational tasks._

_This concept comes from NATO’s definition encompassed in AAP-_
_6 NATO Glossary of Terms and Definitions._


-----

04. The doctrinal goal is to assure a uniform understanding of pre­

paration principles and conduct of operations and to contribute
to accomplishing the optimum level of interoperability of AFCR’s
command corps for AFCR’s components and elements of joint
operations with armed forces of NATO states.

05. The AFCR’s doctrinal hierarchy, as a whole, defines and clarifies

employment principles of AFCR elements during operational
deployments led by NATO, EU, UN or OSCE. In addition, it
defines principles governing independent deployments of AFCR
elements executing assistance tasks in non-military crisis situati­
ons on the CR territory.

06. The content of the AFCR’s doctrinal hierarchy reflects actual

AFCR operational capabilities and at the same time spurs the
further development and improvement of its personnel, mainly
the command corps. Their contents respect the legal order of the
CR and the CR’s commitments following the international law.


-----

07. The AFCR’s doctrine and lower level doctrines contain verbatim

quotations from allied doctrines only in cases, when it is neces­
sary in view of their significance based on their ratification by
relevant state authorities. An operational terminology dictionary
is the base for terminology of all doctrinal pa�ern documents.
The Doctrine of the AFCR with its contents enables unabridged
publication in all public mass media.

08. Documents of the AFCR’s doctrinal pa�ern form one of the

conceptual elements of military potential of the Czech Republic
(see Fig.1). Their actual content is influenced by numerous
factors, particularly the current armed forces reform concept
and achieved level of implementation (particularly in view of
achievable material equipage of the state armed forces – AFCR),
and technological aspects (character) of potential (considered)
military operations. Therefore, the doctrinal hierarchy formulates
at the same time material development requirements and AFCR
combat capabilities to fulfill the AFCR’s basic role.


_Doctrines and other documents of doctrinal pa�ern of the AFCR_
_mirror the current level of opinions on the manner of the AFCR’s_
_activities in operations based on the Czech and foreign warfare_
_recognition and in particular on the experiences from contem­_
_porary operations and exercises. Doctrines serve as a basis of_
_preparation and education of officers on the commanders grade_
_and staff members on all command levels. They serve as an infor­_
_mation source on the principles of operational use of the AFCR_
_not only for allies and coalition partners but as well for broad_
_professional and lay community. They should also declare to_
_possible adversaries the level of the AFCR’s readiness to fulfill its_
_defense function. The level of their presentation in public depends_
_however on the contents of documents with respect to the law of_
_information protection._


-----

**Levels of control of operations**

09. Based on the level of political, administrative and economic

involvement of the state administration, command level of the
AFCR and NATO, and participation of allies and coalition part­
ners in military operations, the following levels of operational
control are distinguished: political-strategic, military-strategic,
operational and tactical level.[1]

1In this case, the military operations are not sectionalized according to the
size of military units but according to the command and control level and
objectives that are to be achieved. Command and control levels can be
classified according to various criteria depending on the type of an operation,
level of NATO (EU) command structure involvement and selected extent of
the CR‘s crisis management (control). An important criterion is the frame of
reference - if it concerns political or military aspects of an operation control.
From this point of view, the segmentation indicated in this document is only
a simplification, which serves for elaboration of other parts of the AFCR’s
doctrine.


-----

10. The CR’s political-strategic control level lies in the sphere of the

government of the CR, parliament and the president of the CR.
Coordination of practical control measures on a political–strate­
gic level is assured by the CR’s Ministry of Defence.

11. **The military-strategic control level consists of taking military**

measures, enabling achievement of specified political-strategic
objectives of the state. On the military-strategic level, AFCR
forces and means can only be used to pursue national, allied,
or international (UN, EU, OSCE) interests in accordance with
decisions and measures taken at the political-strategic state
control level. The ministry of defence executes approved military
measures supporting state security policy in its role as part of
the state political control system. Participation of the CR armed
forces in international operations is proposed and approved by
authorities at the political-strategic level and executed at defence
department levels. The AFCR is the military component of the
CR’s security policy tool.

The representative of the military-strategic level of control in
the Czech Republic is the General Chief of Staff of the AFCR
(GCOS). He is therefore responsible for the build-up and training
of AFCR forces and for achieving the armed forces operational
capabilities defined by the CR’s military strategy. Furthermore,
the GCOS-AFCR is responsible for operational planning and
deployment of AFCR forces in the time of crisis or war. Moreover,


-----

he ensures a close cooperation with allied (international) milita­
ry-strategic authorities. The representative of a military-strategic
control level on the international level (NATO) is the Supreme
Allied Commander. His tasks, responsibilities and assignment
are defined a�er the consultations between civil and military
representatives in individual allied (coalition) countries on the
political-strategic level.


_The NATO military-strategic control level has a significant_
_influence on the AFCR’s operational use. Mainly the components_
_subordinate to the AFCR General Chief of Staff participate on its_
_decision-making process._

_NATO military-strategic control authority is responsible for:_

_• assignment of military-strategic objectives and identification of_
_specific tasks of military operation. The specific tasks of military_
_operations are derived from the expected end-state, which is to be_
_the result of the operation on the strategic level in such a way to_
_enable termination of the conflict;_

_• decision, what military operations must be conducted to achieve_
_military-strategic objectives. It is based on standpoints provided_
_by national military-strategic authorities;_

_• identification of political, financial or legal difficulties for the_
_use of military means including means of allied or coalition_
_partners;_

_• assignment of troops and other means for every military_
_operation. Military-strategic authorities appoint a commander_
_who is responsible for command and control of operations in the_
_area of operation;_

_• assignment of command and control structures;_

_• consultation of operational objectives with operational com­_
_manders and their adjustment to the changing situation;_

_• circumscription of the above mentioned information to the_
_Strategic directives for the commander of the operation._

_These measures are constantly consulted with national authori­_
_ties of military-strategic control level._


-----

12. **The operational level of command and control consists of taking**

decisions and executing measures for the use of military means
to achieve strategic objectives. In practice, it is done by specifying
operational objectives and operations control. The earmarked for­
ces and means of the AFCR can be used on the operational level to
conduct operations in the given area of responsibility, regardless
of the size of the unit or formation. The essential consideration is
the task of the superior grouping to which the earmaked AFCR
forces and means contribute. Almost exclusively, will these forces
and means form a component of a joint multinational grouping
of forces directed by NATO command or by Combined Joint Task
Force command (CJTF). The operational level ensures intercon­
nection between military-strategic objectives and activities of the
units on a tactical level.

13. **The tactical command level is the level on which the units,**

formations, large units or tactical groupings are deployed in
operation. On the tactical level, the units, formations, large units
or tactical groupings conduct combat, optionally non-combat ac­
tivity to achieve tactical objectives, and in some cases operational
or strategic objectives as well.


_Determination of the control level of military operation is not very_
_o�en unambiguous, particularly in combined operations. In this_
_case, the levels of operational control will intermesh not only on_
_the national and the allied (coalition) level, but even on different_
_control levels with respect to the vertical hierarchy, regardless_
_on the extent of the detached forces. For example, sending an_
_AFCR company-sized unit to such an operation will require,_
_participation by all command and control levels of the AFCR and_
_civil administration of the Czech Republic during planning and_
_preparation. Concurrently, the political and command structures_
_of NATO (EU) will be involved in planning and preparing the_
_operation. In the course of the operation, the company commander_
_will represent the tactical control level during the fulfillment of_
_the tactical tasks, but the activity of the unit may have political­_
_-strategic importance with respect to the Czech Republic and will_
_therefore be supported at all higher control levels._


-----

14. The broad spectrum of possible operations, including their possi­

ble scope, contributes to the loss of accurately defined boundaries
between objectives and tasks, executed by particular command
and control levels, which means for example, that some tactical
activities can ensure political-strategic objectives fulfillment. The
possible relationship between particular command and control
levels from the operational tasks viewpoint and their alternatives
is depicted in Figure 2.

_The permeation of the control levels of the military operations_
_develops in the course of the operation. Mainly the time frame_
_of the operation can not be anticipated. Some operations can last_
_a relatively short time (natural disaster help) or a very long time_
_(peace support operations). The end of the operation can emerge_
_from the fulfillment of the operational task or from the political­_
_-strategic decision (the AFCR was for example withdrawn from_
_the SFOR operation before the fulfillment of the task, but a�er the_
_fulfillment of the political-strategic objective from the viewpoint_
_of the CR)._

#### CHAPTER 2

 MILITARY OPERATIONS


-----

#### MILITARY OPERATIONS

15. Military operations represent the basic method of the concen­

trated and coordinated use of armed forces in a given area and
time. The AFCR can participate in these operations according to
the decisions of authorities at the political-strategic control level.
Military operations can be executed in time of peace, crisis or
war and their character is influenced in particular by the security
environment in which they are conducted.

16. **The current security environment is characterised by instability,**

variety and the unpredictability of security threats and risks.
Security threats of any NATO country are indirect security
threats to the CR as well. The risk of a large-scale conventional
military a�ack on European territory is presently very unlikely
and such a potential threat can be detected in good time, thus
enabling to take appropriate measures. In the long-term perspe­
ctive, however, this possibility, including an a�ack by weapons of
mass destruction, cannot be ruled out. Serious security threats are
presently represented by states, non-governmental groups and
organizations, which oppress human rights and freedom and
commit violence and terrorist a�acks. The topicality of asymmet­
ric threats increases, especially terrorism and threats connected
with possible misuse of dangerous materials and technologies,
natural and industrial disasters, organized crime, massive
and illegal human migrations and drug trafficking, dangerous
infectious diseases, violation of information and control systems,
serious imperilment of public order and property of citizens.
Security risks resulting from religious and/or ethnic conflicts
or from economic and social problems and political instability
persist and in some cases are increased.

17. The AFCR must be able to operate in any operational environ­

ment while carrying out tasks to eliminate possible risks. AFCR’s
operational capabilities, training and soldier preparation, concept


-----

of its equipping and organizational structure must correspond to
this requirement.

**Classification of military operations**

18. For military operations the use of military forces are typical,

although they can be supported by forces and means of govern­
mental and non-governmental organizations. Military operations
may have a national or a multinational character and are gene­
rally conducted with participation of several services as a joint
operation.

19. **Classification of military operations is deduced from the**

analysis and generalizing experiences from the past armed
conflicts (wars) and the application of armed forces in them. In
view of warfare’s constant development, changes in the security
environment and in armed conflict’s character, it is the subject
of permanent examination. In current operational practice, the
individual types of operations intermesh, follow one another or
are carried out concurrently in one place and time. Every such
classification is therefore only a helping tool for comprehension
of mutual context, principles and natural pa�erns and can’t
influence the commander’s decision-making in the conduct of
an operation. Classification of military operations, on which
the structure of this doctrine is based, results from the NATO
operation classification and is depicted in Figure 3.

2Term „national“ comes from english “Nation“. In this sense it corresponds
to the term „state“.

Fig. 3: Classification of military operations


-----

_There are other criterion for operations classification. An example_
_is classification of operations from a political-legal perspective,_
_which divides operations on war and operations other than war._
_War operations are conducted in a war. Operations other than_
_war may precede or follow a war. These operations can also_
_coincide with war operations, for instance in a different area_
_within the theatre of operation. The difference between these_
_types of operations depends on the political (non-military) rating_
_of the conflict and its solution. For war operations, the strategy of_
_military solution is desired, and state is usually achieved through_
_coercion with combat power. To conclude operations other than_
_war, the use of non-military means such as diplomacy is preferred._
_The conflict’s military solution is only one (and sometimes even_
_a subordinate) component of crisis management._


**Characteristic of military operations**

20. **National operations are military operations conducted only**

by one state[2]. In the conditions of the Czech Republic, it will
generally involve operations of the CR’s armed forces within the
measures of crisis management of the CR with a possible link to
NATO or EU crisis management system.

21. **Multinational operations are military operations of forces and**

means of several states. As a rule, these operations are conducted
as joint operations, that means operations with the participation
of more armed forces components, and are usually conducted in
coalitions or allied groupings. The AFCR will generally operate
within joint multinational (combined) operations. Earmarked
forces and means of the Ground and Air Forces of the AFCR will
usually in these operations, operate together. In isolated cases,
the means of the Air Force of the AFCR can operate within the air
component of the Joint Forces Commander (JFC).

3 Article 5 of the North-Atlantic Treaty specifies, that an armed a�ack against
any of NATO member states is considered an armed a�ack against all NATO
member states.


-----

_Multinational operations are the means for realisation of the_
_NATO (EU) security policy objectives or they ensue from_
_the UN Security Council resolutions. Thus, they represent_
_operations conducted using common political and military force_
_of the states involved. At the same time these operations enable_
_collectively to share political risks, expenses of all kinds, save_
_human, financial and material resources of particular countries_
_and create a mutual information base. These operations increase_
_the efficiency of diplomatic and international economic impact of_
_participating countries._

_Entire activity of the AFCR in peacetime and in a crisis situation_
_must lead to the ability to effectively participate in preparation_
_and conduct of combined operations. The AFCR will, apart from_
_national operations on the CR’s territory and rescue operations_
_within bilateral agreements, almost exclusively operate in multi­_
_national operations._

_The effectiveness of combined operations is (may be) limited by_
_factors, whose elimination must be the center of consideration_
_of all AFCR’s command authorities in time of preparation and_
_conduct of operations, and they primarily include:_

_• national differences in the manner of command and tactics,_

_• low level of English language and differences in national_
_interpretation of common terminology;_

_• differences in weapon systems control, operating together_
_within operational and tactical groupings;_

_• information system incompatibility, from technical, procedural_
_and content aspects;_

_• inability to use common multinational logistic capacities;_

_• legal constraints of national contingents activities resulting_
_from national particularities of legal systems;_

_• cultural differences resulting from different cultural traditions_
_and religious customs affecting the behavior of members of parti­_
_cular national contingents._

_According to AJP- 01 (B) art. 0216 0216_


-----

22. The basis for planning and conducting combined operations

for AFCR commanders and staffs is first of all the Allied Joint
Doctrine AJP-01/B/) and related publications and other NATO
standardisation agreements ratified by the CR (herea�er only
NATO doctrines). The AFCR doctrine is based on AJP-01, in
terms of contents, but does not replace the allied document. The
CR’s armed forces staff members and commanders at all levels
involved in the planning process and conduct of combined opera­
tions must know these allied documents and follow their content.
Allied documents usually form a basis for EU and UN operations
too, unless required otherwise by the character of the operation.

23. Military operations can also be distinguished by the effect of

conflicting parties on one another either by the use or method of
applying force. Asymmetric conflict develops as the conflicting
parties develop reciprocally different military actions.

24. The characteristic of the military operations is also determined

by whether they are conducted with conventional or unconven­
tional weapons. Operations with the use of weapons of mass
destruction (MDW) are characterised as unconventional. The use
of non-lethal weapon systems in a conventional armed conflict
is another means of influencing an adversary or population.
Specific means of activity against an adversary is to counteract
his information and communication systems.

25. Actions of warring parties can be among other things, characteri­

sed as operations of regular or irregular armed forces as well.

**Operations of regular armed forces are characterised by the**
employment of organised units operating in a way that is in
accordance with international humanitarian law. Regular ope­
rations are characterised by, among other things, standardised
command and control methods.

**Operations of irregular armed forces are conducted by armed**
groups or by individuals with various levels of organisation,
using methods and combat means which are usually contrary
to traditional combat, international humanitarian law and com­
monly held ethical and moral principles of civilized society. The
activities of regular armed forces against irregular armed forces
will therefore have a character of asymmetric operation.


-----

_Taking maximum advantage of the effect of surprise, irregular_
_troops are highly mobile and they repeatedly execute missions_
_not only at night, and in rough terrain, but in places with full_
_concentration of military forces and civilian population as well._
_During operations of irregular units, it is not always clear which_
_party is responsible for aggression (individual armed or terrorist_
_actions)._


26. The AFCR will operate mainly by NATO and EU-led operations.

According to the NATO Strategic Conception, the forces and
means of NATO member states can operate in collective defence
operations according to Article 5 or in operations outside Article
5 of the North Atlantic treaty.

According to Article 5 of the North-Atlantic Treaty, operations
conducted in concordance with that Article are usually opera­
tions of mutual territorial defence.3 Goals of collective defence
operations can be achieved by collective defence operations of
high and low intensity.

   - **High intensity collective defence operations are conducted**

with full deployment of forces and means of participating
countries within allied or coalition operation. They are carried
out usually in war, with exploitation of all human and material
resources, including mobilized ones. They are generally
connected with large-scale impacts on civilian population
both in the theatre of operations and in countries involved
whose territory does not constitute the area of operation and
can be conducted with or without the use of some weapons,
particularly weapons of mass destruction.

   - **Low intensity collective defence operations can be conducted**

with the aim of destroying or neutralising opponents forces,
which are not comparable to allied (coalition) forces in terms
of number, armament, level of training or the war fighting
methods.

4AJP-01 (B) – Allied Joint Doctrine, December 2002


-----

**Operations outside Article 5. The NATO summit in Washington**
in 1999, within the NATO Strategic Concept, newly defined
the term “Non-Article 5 Crisis Response Operations”4. Within
crisis management, operations outside Article 5 can (in a stage of
inception prevention and crisis solution) use a wide spectrum of
means – political, civil and military. Operations outside Article 5
are used to:

  - assure freedom and security of NATO member states;

   - enforce international law principles, including its humanitari­

an aspects;

   - participate in inception prevention measures and crises soluti­

ons in accordance with NATO declared objectives.

For this doctrine’s purpose, the term “peace operation” is further
used for crisis solution operations outside Article 5.

27. **Military operations, as a tool of preventive diplomacy include**

measures, adopted and executed in advance, based on impen­
ding crisis signs evaluation, before the expected crisis occurs. The
aim of preventive diplomacy is to avert an outbreak of violence
or a further spread of violence and to eliminate the causes of the
crisis, in particular. Limited use of force or its demonstration,
which can have the character of a military operation, can be
a part of these measures. Nonetheless, main instruments of peace
enforcement are diplomatic means – mediation, negotiation or
other forms of peace consultations.

28. The AFCR must be ready to participate in conduct of operations

within combined joint operations and be able to conduct indi­
vidual national operations according to the principles described
further in this doctrine.

5NATO Integrated Extended Air Defence System. These operations are
controlled in a NATO environment, based on multinational agreements of
participating countries.


-----

**Main types of military operations**

29. **Combat operations are operations, in which the counterparts try**

to achieve their objectives by combat, using weapons. Military
operations to beat back an armed attack aimed at disrupting
territorial integrity, political independence or state security,
including fulfillment of allied commitments to common area
defence, are also considered combat operations. In view of their
nature, the combat operations can be divided into offensive and
defensive. According to the opponent‘s organization and conduct
of operations, the combat operations can be also divided into
operations conducted against regular or irregular forces. Combat
operations can be conducted both during a war or in some cases
during operations other than war.

30. **Non-combat operations are operations, in which manpower and**

resources of armed forces are used without the calculated use of
force (weapons and ammunition). In an emergency situation, we­
apons can be used even in the course of a non-combat operation,
in particular for assaulted troop’s self-defence while performing
non-combat tasks or to protect civilian population a�acked by
weapons. Non-combat operations are further divided into peace
and supporting operations conducted outside the territory of the
Czech Republic and operations of the CR’s armed forces on the
territory of the CR. By supporting operations, the military aspect
of the operation is suppressed, and with their nature they almost
lose the character of classical military operations, even though at
times the armed forces can play a decisive role in the operations.

_The significant difference between combat and non-combat_
_operations, highlighted above, is that they are conducted with_
_the approval of the legitimate government or with the approval of_
_representatives of the disputed parties on the territory of the par­_
_ticular state struck with crisis. This approval requirement does_
_not mean that a peace force commander cannot use his organic_
_weapons (force) under prearranged conditions._

31. **Special, information and psychological operations** can be

conducted within both combat and non-combat operations.


_The significant difference between combat and non-combat_
_operations, highlighted above, is that they are conducted with_
_the approval of the legitimate government or with the approval of_
_representatives of the disputed parties on the territory of the par­_
_ticular state struck with crisis. This approval requirement does_
_not mean that a peace force commander cannot use his organic_
_weapons (force) under prearranged conditions._


-----

**Special operations are activities conducted by, for this purpose**
specially assigned, trained and equipped troops, who usually
use specific ways of operation. The task of special operations
is to achieve, possibly to contribute, strategic or operational
objectives of military operation by activities at the tactical level.
Based on evaluation of indications or threats, they may be condu­
cted within military operations, not only before the outbreak of
a crisis but in the course of the crisis (war) too, independent or in
coordination with operations of other forces to achieve military,
political, economic and psychological objectives.

**Information operations constitute a summary of coordinated**
activities aimed at affecting the decision-making process of an
adversary. The aim of the operations is the accomplishment of
military and political objectives by counteraction on information,
information processes and systems of the adversary and other
parties while making use of and defending friendly information,
information processes and systems.

**Psychological operations are activities carried out in peacetime,**
during crisis and war. They are directed at armed forces and
population of an adversary and other countries with the aim
to influence their attitude and conduct to achieve political and
military objectives. They include strategic, combat and consolida­
ted psychological activities. Psychological operations constitute
usually a part of information operations.

32. **Operations of the CR’s armed forces on the territory of the CR.**

In case of operations controlled by the CR’s government, the CR’s
armed forces may execute primarily the following tasks:

  - air space defence of the CR, particularly within the

NATINEADS system[5];

   - guarding of facilities vital for state defence;

   - assistance operations to support the police of the CR;

  - operations within an integrated rescue system of the CR (IRS).

5NATO Integrated Extended Air Defence System. These operations are
controlled in a NATO environment, based on multinational agreements of
participating countries.


-----

_In extreme cases, all types of the military operations may_
_be conducted on the CR’s territory. The AFCR will usually_
_participate in these operations within a multinational grouping_
_led by NATO, EU or UN or independently, under the control of_
_political-strategic authorities of the CR._


**Joint operations**

33. Current multinational operations, both combat and non-combat,

are usually conducted in joint operational (strategic) groupings
of two or more armed force components (ground forces, air force,
navy, possibly special forces). The term joint operations is used
for these operations and they are usually conducted under a joint
force commander, who can have these service components sub­
ordinate to him: land component, air component and maritime
component.

34. The AFCR will, as a rule, participate in joint operations within

land component of multinational joint forces. In the course of
such operations, the CR’s detached air force units may become
a part of this component. However, it is possible, that forces and
resources of the AFCR´s air force can operate as well within the
air component of a joint multinational operation.


-----

The use of Land Forces in joint operations

35. Land forces in multinational joint operations play a decisive

role in dominating territory and physically eliminating an
adversary. They are the most appropriate for accomplishing the
final measures of terminating the operation and transitioning to
peace-enforcement operations. Although the land forces are able
to conduct independent land operations, the character of current
and future operational environments requires, in necessary
degree, involvement of other Services (air, special, possibly navy)
into these operations, particularly at the operational level.

36. It is necessary, that the land forces (including army aviation)

include in its structure, units and formations, characterized by
high combat readiness and fighting capacity, manouevrability
and endurance. They must have a flexible structure of the com­
mand and control system, effective combat support and combat
security and be interoperable with allied forces.

37. Generally, the land forces execute the following tasks in

operations:

   - operate across the entire spectrum of military operations;

   - participate in conducting of all types of armed combat;

  - conduct combat operations in close cooperation with the

air force and in multinational operations, according to the
character of the situation (operation), with the naval forces,
optionally with other Services;

  - attack targets throughout the depth of operational formation

of an adversary with air, naval and other services;

   - carry combat activity day and night, in all climatic and terrain

conditions;

  - confront the forces of an adversary, especially armored and

low-flying targets, destroy or extinguish enemy artillery and
other fire systems and means;

  - participate in conducting information operations;

   - conduct significant part of peace operations content.


-----

The use of the Air Force in joint operations

38. The air force is one of the significant components, necessary for

total objectives achievement of multinational joint operations. Its
range, speed, adaptability to the changes and ability to concentra­
te the effort, enable the air force in joint operations with land for­
ces and other services to achieve surprise, maintain a high tempo
of an operation and carry operations in multiple directions.

39. The air force supports the land forces in operational objectives

achievement through (by):

  - obtaining and maintaining air superiority;

   - air interdiction;

  - conducting direct air support;

  - conducting air electronic warfare;

  - conducting air reconnaissance and observation;

   - air transport.

40. **Air operations represent the employment of the air force to achi­**

eve military objectives. They can be organised as multinational,
joint or independent. Joint air operations are planned by an air
component commander and are supported by other component
commanders and can be divided into four basic categories:
counter air operations; strategic air operations; anti-surface air
operations; supporting air operations.

41. **Counter air operations are activities conducted with the aim of**

achieving the desired level of air superiority. Counter air opera­
tions are divided into offensive and defensive. a specific type of
counter air operation is an operation to neutralize an opponent’s
air defence. The AFCR‘s air force will be, above all, involved
in defensive counter air operations and to a certain degree in
offensive counter air operations.

42. **Strategic air operations are activities aimed at eliminating promi­**

nent targets, such as state political control centers, armed forces
command and control systems, energy sources and armament
industry production capacities and the most important military


-----

and industrial capacities. Defensive strategic air operations are
aimed at beating back the aggression against NATO territory or
the deployment area of allied troops. There is a low probability
of the AFCR’s air force involvement into the offensive strategic
air operations, to a certain extent it can be engaged in defensive
strategic air operations.

43. **Anti-surface air operations are the air force activities with the**

aim of eliminating enemy forces who try to invade a certain
territory or naval area. The air force of the AFCR will be (may
be), above all, involved in the air interdiction and direct (close)
air support operations. Participation in operations against naval
targets is unlikely.

44. **Supporting air operations. The air force can be used for support**

of individual operational grouping components in all types of
operations and all types of environments. The basic types of
supporting air operations comprise of:

  - air reconnaissance and observation;

   - air transport;

   - air-to-air-refueling;

   - electronic warfare;

  - aerial command and control;

  - search and rescue (SAR);

  - combat search and rescue (CSAR);

   - special air operations.

45. Forces and means of the AFCR’s air force can be organizationally

included in the land forces structure or they can execute tasks for
the land forces benefit. In joint operations they can participate
particularly in airmobile operations and operations of joint air
attack teams.

   - **Airmobile operations of land forces, which include air trans­**

port of land forces by various helicopters, enable to speed up
a manoeuvre execution and a strike of land forces. They are
conducted by using of airborne troops and fire support, in
which the AFCR’s helicopter units may also participate.


-----

- **Joint air a�ack team (JAAT) operations represent a coordi­**

nated attack of combat and supporting means of air and land
forces, embracing numerous weapon and support systems,
particularly combat helicopters, direct air support aircraft
and artillery. These strike means should always be supported
and secured by the activity of electronic warfare resources,
air defense and suppression of enemy air defenses. JAAT
operations are planned by the land component commander of
joint combined (coalition) forces and are supported by the air
component commander.

 FUNDAMENTALS OF PREPARATION
 AND CONDUCT OF OPERATIONS


-----

#### FUNDAMENTALS OF PREPARATION
 AND CONDUCT OF OPERATIONS

46. Preparation and conduct of military operations depend on

a number of factors and fundamentals, which are the subjects
of military theoretical examination, and serve as the basis for
doctrinal content. The test of a military theory’s correctness is
operational practice. Military theory applied in the practice has
three levels: military strategy, operational art and tactics.


-----

**Military strategy**

47. Military strategy deals with the preparation, the use and sup­

port of armed forces and state or coalition territory to achieve
objectives established by authorities on the political-military and
military-strategic state (coalition) control level. It is a part of
national (international) security strategy and represents opinions
on the use of military force for achieving the state’s or group of
states objectives when safeguarding its (their) external security.
Military strategy document of the CR constitutes a political-mili­
tary framework for the use of armed forces of the CR.

48. **Military strategy of the CR represents a collection of funda­**

mental principles to ensure the defense of the CR and principles
for building-up and use of armed forces of the CR. It belongs
to the fundamental security documents of the CR, which create
a conceptual framework for armed forces for fulfilling military
tasks of national defence, implementing commitments of NATO
collective defence and participating in allied and coalition ope­
rations. It is an indivisible part of military-strategic control level,
and has a national and an international dimension.

**Operational art and tactics**

49. **Operational art as a part of military art deals with:**

  - theory and practice of preparation and conduct of multinatio­

nal and national, joint and independent operations, carried out
by operational groupings (formations and large formations),
possibly armed forces services (components).

  - operational command level activities;

   - analysis, evaluating and an effort to utilize all circumstances

that can influence the preparation, conduct and support of an
operation to achieve operational objectives.

Operational art stems from military strategy demands, ensures
implementation of military-strategic objectives and tasks, and
determines the direction of tactical development, as the link
between the two levels. Its task is, among others, a transfer of
strategic objectives into the operational plan, which deals with
combat activity on a tactical level in such a way, that contributes
to the achievement of objectives of a military campaign.


-----

_Apart from being a science, directing operations at an operational_
_level is very much an art. Operational art requires a wide scope_
_and an ability to anticipate. Members of the AFCR and interna­_
_tional staffs, involved in the process of operational planning and_
_directing of an operation must be able to anticipate the conse­_
_quences of tactical actions they carry out or are involved in._

_Operational art means much more than just applying procedures_
_and ways based on the knowledge of doctrines, directives and_
_manuals. The operational art determines when, where and to_
_what purpose the armed forces can carry out military operations._
_Skillful and purposeful application of broad and profound_
_knowledge and comprehension of mutual relations between_
_factors which can influence planning and conducting of the_
_military operation is assumed (available force, place, time and_
_information)._


50. **Tactics, as the oldest part of military art, includes the theory**

and practice of combat preparation and conduct. It examines
objective natural pa�erns of combat and based on this, elaborates
principles of its preparation, conduct and termination of combat
activity. It deals with theoretical and practical knowledge of na­
tural pa�erns, content, character, ways and forms of preparation
and conduct of combat. It also deals with how operations and
other tactical activities of units, formations and large units are
conducted, their control and all-round support. Tactics treats the
way of accomplishing operational objectives at the tactical level
of command and control.

**Natural patterns of current military operations**

51. The success of military operations is a result of a combination

of the proper application of common and special principles
of preparing and conducting operations, and respecting their
natural pa�erns or tendencies. The natural pa�erns of armed
conflicts and wars, for the most part, developed independently
from politicians and commanders and from this point of view,
they have an objective character. The following are some natural
pa�erns describing current military operations:


-----

_Natural pa�erns of military operations conduct recognition is_
_important mainly in times of their preparation. Military hard­_
_ware and facilities, organizational structures, troop training,_
_command and control systems and content of doctrines must_
_correspond to the character of a future operational environment._
_History of warfare showed many times, that a majority of the_
_armies had usually prepared for foregone war and that success_
_in a new armed conflict was reached by those, who correctly_
_understood (mostly untraditionally) development or origin of_
_new natural pa�erns of armed combat._

_Validity of some generally acknowledged natural pa�erns is_
_not absolute and develops over time. Some natural pa�erns are_
_associated with the introduction of new technologies, which can_
_behave differently in practice than expected in times of their_
_development and the introduction. Some natural pa�erns are_
_associated with the development of human society and values of_
_interest groups._



- multinational (coalition) character of operations;

- growth of armed forces involvement in non-combat activities,

which never belonged to the activities of the forces or they did,
but just marginally;

- planning and conduct of a ba�le and an operation throughout

the depth of the ba�lefield, in all dimensions and command
and control levels;

- increasing importance of an individual and small units in

relation to the result of a ba�le and an operation and relatively
decreasing importance of huge operational groupings;

- high degree (importance) of decision-making flexibility and

modularity of organizational structures, resulting from the
unpredictability of future operational environments;

- increasing importance of public opinion and mass media

influence throughout the preparation and conduct of military
operations;

- globalisation of security risks and threats, broadening of


-----

asymmetric threats and extent of conduct of asymmetric
operations;

  - use of new technologies, digitization of weapon systems,

command and control systems and theatre of operations in
itself and other.

**Circumstances influencing preparation and conduct of**

**multinational operations**

52. Military multinational operations are influenced by numerous

circumstances, which must be taken into consideration in all
phases of preparing, conducting and terminating operations.

53. The CR’s armed forces military-strategic control level authorities

must analyze the relationship between political and military ob­
jectives of an operation in all phases of preparing and conducting
an operation, and participate in their shaping and developing.
These authorities must always provide required information and
appropriate substantiated proposals to the state and coalition
(alliance) political-strategic control level authorities.

54. In all phases of preparing and conducting operations, a distinct

relationship between operational and military-strategic objectives
must be apparent. On the other hand it must be considered, that
military-strategic objectives may change in the course of an ope­
ration, consequently, the planning process must be continuous.

55. Relationship between military operations and military-strategic

objectives may be in practice complicated by the fact, that there
will always be objectives, the coalition wants to achieve and in
which it is interested, but concurrently there may be objectives
only some countries can be interested in, but not the whole
coalition. Troop activities at the tactical level may deviate from
strategic objectives achievement due to, for example ambiguous
and inadequately specified rules of engagement, which may
consequently decelerate the conduct of an operation.

56. Command and control operational levels will usually have to

respect the character of joint operations even in operations with


-----

distinctly land operational focus. In such cases, land forces will as
a rule create task groupings together with other Services.

57. Designated AFCR forces will generally operate as a component of

combined alliance or coalition forces. An important requirement
of the present and the future is therefore harmonization of the
CR‘s national interests with allied (coalition) interests and an
achievement of a corresponding level of standardisation of
operational procedures and the AFCR’s armament with NATO
member states.

58. Forces, means and other resources (herea�er only resources)

can be assigned to the operational commander by various ways.
Some resources can be assigned to him without limits, others will
be assigned to him with limited utilization, but all resources must
be used in the most effective way. Apart from this, he/she will
have a chance to use local resources and infrastructure provided
by a host nation (for example ports, airfields, training areas etc.).
During Article 5 of the North-Atlantic Treaty operations, the
resources will usually be prepared in advance. During coalition
operations, in particular peace operations outside the territory of
the NATO states, this will not o�en be the case.

59. Civilian populations are increasingly important in military

operations. This applies particularly in peace operations, where
a properly working Civil Military Cooperation (CIMIC) system
is one of most important keys to an operation’s success. For
example, the possibility of refugee movement or limiting damage
to a public infrastructure must be considered by the operation
commander. In some cases the military force may be the only
structured and properly working organisation in the deployment
area. Se�ing up an effective government structure can also be
amongst an operation’s objectives.

**Factors affecting the conduct of operations**

60. **Mobility consists in exploitation of manoeuvres to deploy forces**

into favorable positions, from which they can operate on an
adversary, or in an ability to redeploy in desired time limits from
one place to another, maintaining the readiness (ability) to fulfill


-----

assigned combat tasks. Mobility influences in particular the flexi­
bility of staffs’ and commanders’ thought as well as a command
and control system, armed forces material support, reliable and
high-performance communication and information systems and
others.

61. **Operational tempo is an expression of the relative ratio of**

friendly unit activities to the activities of adversary units. Higher
tempo of a friendly operations performance creates prerequisites
for achieving initiative and dominance over the opponent and
accrues combat potential, which the opponent is not able to face.
The consequence is the enemy‘s delayed reaction in the wrong
place.

62. **Surprise constitutes a significant factor for success. Surprise acti­**

vity performed in unexpected ways, in an unexpected area and in
unexpected time can be decisive during the achievement of laid
down objectives, even in conditions when own combat power is
on a lower level in terms of quality and quantity. Surprise can
be achieved based on sufficient information on the opponent,
analysis of weak and strong spots in his anticipated intentions,
capabilities of his troops and means and command system.

_Without surprise it is very difficult, if not impossible, to achieve_
_a dominancy in decisive moments and operation areas. Even see­_
_mingly small (tactical) surprise can lead to gaining considerable_
_operational advantages. Therefore it is imperative that comman­_
_ders at all levels a�empt to surprise an opponent whenever and_
_wherever feasible. Concurrently, they must consider that their_
_opponent will also try to surprise them. Surprise,in itself, does_
_not mean much, unless the gained effect is immediately exploited_
_and developed._

63. **Culmination point represents the point of a turn, the point of**

a reversal. An operation reached its culmination point, when
combat power falls below the level required to accomplish
the task and doesn’t enable achieving the appointed objective.
During the offensive, the a�acker reaches a culmination point at
the moment when he is no longer able to carry out the offensive
and has to go over to the defense. An enforced operational break


_Without surprise it is very difficult, if not impossible, to achieve_
_a dominancy in decisive moments and operation areas. Even see­_
_mingly small (tactical) surprise can lead to gaining considerable_
_operational advantages. Therefore it is imperative that comman­_
_ders at all levels a�empt to surprise an opponent whenever and_
_wherever feasible. Concurrently, they must consider that their_
_opponent will also try to surprise them. Surprise ,in itself, does_
_not mean much, unless the gained effect is immediately exploited_
_and developed._


-----

o�en occurs upon reaching the culmination point. It is therefore
important, that the commander is able to anticipate when the
culmination point will be reached and discern in the course of an
operation when it was reached.

64. **Information superiority. Using modern information and com­**

munication technologies enables commanders, in qualitatively
be�er conditions, to prepare, plan and control the use of his for­
ces. Current operations are conducted in unified digitalized situ­
ation environments and are pursued with information acquired
and analysed in time which is close to real time. Information and
communication systems enable one to achieve high operational
efficiency, but they are very vulnerable. There is a probability,
that they will be a subject of independent information operations
from both the friendly forces side and the opponent‘s side.

65. **Space and time have a specific significance in all kinds of operati­**

ons. The notion of space in current warfare must be understood as
three-dimensional in consequence of the collective activity of all
Services. This space extends deep into the depth of both our own
and our opponents rear area and at the same time, operations
can be carried out in the air or in cosmic space. Decision-making
activity and action phase on the enemy shorten and usually occur
concurrently, in real time.

66. **Relation between positional a�rition and manoeuvre combat**

**activity. In relation between offensive and defensive, a�rition**
and manoeuvre have their significance. During the static a�rition
fight, the opponent is eliminated by concentrated impact of
firepower. During the manoeuvre fight, the enemy is defeated
by disrupting his structure in the weakest spot using dynamic
combat activity, which enables one to decide combat relatively
quickly without utilizing strategic resources. In reality, solely
static a�ritional or solely manoeuvre combat activity does not
exist.


-----

**Basis for command and control in operations**

67. A flexible and resilient command and control system is a prin­

cipal condition for achieving success in a military operation.
Achieving operational objectives depends particularly on dep­
loying appropriate units at the correct place and time. Chapter 4
of this document (doctrine) deals with the command and control
in detail. The following principles constitute the framework for
command and control model options.

68. **Integrity of the command is ensured by appointing one opera­**

tion commander who is responsible for preparing and directing
an operation and coordinating the use of supporting units
and resources. The commander has a concrete commanding
relationship to these units and resources, described further in
this doctrine. Limitations for deployment of national contingents
and supporting means can be specified at the operational level.
To prevent ambiguity in the use of resources, it is important that
the staff of the operational commander is permanently in contact
with national representatives (if possible in the deployment
area). In conditions of AFCR’s forces and means deployment, it is
usually achieved by permanent contact of the AFCR’s contingent
commander with the MOD joint operational centre director (JOC
MOD).

69. **Command structure. Although there are many models of**

command structures, in practice there are four of the most used,
within which the forces and means of the AFCR can operate:

   - **Combined Joint Task Forces model (CJTF), which is characte­**

rised by a joint staff and subordinate components. This model
is especially suitable for handling of a large-scale crises, during
which individual components operate together.

   - **Model with distinct superiority of one component is chara­**

cterised by the existence of a joint staff, where the command
and control elements of other component commands are
integrated. This model is especially suitable for handling of
a small-scale crises, where a relatively small number of com­
ponents operate together.


-----

   - **Model with a leading role of one of the allied (coalition)**

**country (Lead Nation) is based on an agreement under which**
one nation assigns a commander and establishes the core of
a multinational operational staff for operational command.
Nevertheless, the operation has the mandate of an international
security organization (NATO, EU, UN). In such a case, national
contingents operate under the command of this commander
and usually the NATO standard operational procedures are
used in the command. This model is usually adopted because
of limited time for operation preparation.

   - **Model of operational command during national operations**

**on the territory of the CR. It addresses operations according to**
chapter 7 of this document. Operational planning and control
is done in compliance with law No. 240/2000 regarding an
crisis management. According to law No.239/2000, regarding
integrated rescue system, the coordination of all departments
and components of the CR integrated rescue system (IRS) is
arranged by the central crisis headquarters. Coordination
measures within the defence department are carried out by
the Ministry of Defence emergency staff, whose activity is
supervised by the joint operational center of the Ministry of
Defence (JOC MO).

70. **Command relations in multinational operations have a number**

of specified relationships depending on the command level, type
of operation, mandate of the operation commander and other
circumstances. It concerns the following types of relations:

   - **Full command (FULLCOM) means military competence**

and responsibility of the commander to give orders to his
subordinates. It applies to all aspects of military operations
and administration and **exists only within national armed**
forces (the term command in an international context contains
lower level of competence than in a solely national context).
No NATO or coalition commander has the possibility of full
command over the units assigned to him, since during the
detachment of units to NATO, individual countries hand over
only operational command or operational control.


-----

   - **Operational Command (OPCOM) means, that a commander**

of the operation is entrusted with full competence to give tasks
to his subordinate commanders, which include deployment of
units, reallocation of troops and preservation or hand-over of
operational or tactical control, when the commander considers
this as necessary. This does not include responsibility for
administration.

   - **Operational Control (OPCON) means the operational com­**

mander is entrusted with full competence to control troops
assigned to him to accomplish specific combat tasks or mis­
sions, which are usually limited by a function, time or place.
It applies to the unit s deployment and preservation or hand­
-over of tactical command to these units. It includes neither the
right to assign special tasks to these units nor administrative
and logistic control.

   - **Tactical Command, (TACOM), represent a full competence**

entrusted to the commander, which entitles him to task troops
under his command with the objective to accomplish a combat
task specified by the higher command.

   - **Tactical Control (TACON) is elaborate and usually direct**

management and control of redeployment or manoeuvres
essential for the accomplishment of ordered tasks.

   - **Administrative Control, (ADMINCON) is exercising the**

higher status or control of subordinates and other components
in administrative matters, such as human resources manage­
ment, supply, services and others, which are not included in
operational tasks of subordinates and other organizations.

**Basis for operations support**

71. The nature and extent of the support depends on an operational

task, particularly on the conditions of taking up the operational
formation. Support of operations represents mainly logistics,
personnel augmentation and medical support. The following
NATO principles for operations support on the operational level,
which are also decisive for the AFCR forces control in operations,
apply:


-----

- **Movements** of national contingents to the area of operation

and their deployment until the takeover by the commander
of multinational forces are the responsibilities of dispatching
countries, which have the major responsibility for arranging
strategic redeployments and movements (NATO coordinates
mutual harmonization of these movements).

- **Responsibility for logistic support. NATO and dispatching**

countries have a collective responsibility to provide logistical
support of multinational forces. However, every dispatching
country is definitively responsible for supporting their natio­
nal forces assigned to the multinational forces.

- **Cooperation between states particularly in the field of logistics**

and medical support is the major prerequisite of efficient
support.

- **Command. The commander of the national contingent must**

have appropriate power to command logistic and medical
resources in the area of operation.

- **Sufficiency of means. Level of supply and distribution of**

logistics resources allocated to troops must be sufficient to gu­
arantee the expected level of readiness, capability and mobility
and long-lasting activities.

- **Effectiveness. Logistics resources must be deployed in the**

most effective way because they will always be in a great
demand.

- **Flexibility. Logistical and medical support resources of the**

troops, units and groupings of various states must be dynamic,
flexible, mobile and able to react like the supported unit.

- **Provision of information. The dispatching country must**

provide the operational commander with necessary informa­
tion on logistic resources and personnel information to ensure
effective use of all forces.

- **Maneuver with supplies. In a critical situation and in the**

interest of operational success, the operational commander
has the right to request the redistribution of material or logistic
services between operational formation groups regardless of
nationality.

#### CHAPTER 4

 FUNDAMENTALS OF MILITARY
 OPERATIONS


-----

#### FUNDAMENTALS OF MILITARY
 OPERATIONS

72. **Principles of military operations form fundamental rules for**

the use of military means at the strategic, operational or tactical
level. Most of the principles can be applied both to combat and
non-combat operations. Principles, as generalised and by the
troops proven experiences, constitute the foundations of all
military operations, but commanders must use them creatively in
operations.

73. **Legality of military operations. The commanders must, in all**

kinds of operations, adhere to the rules of national and internati­
onal law in their decisions and at the same time follow the Rules
of Engagement valid for military operation.

74. **Functions of military operations are categories of activity which,**

when successfully implemented, create conditions for operational
success. They include primarily command and control, military
intelligence, fire power and manoeuvre, force protection and
all-round support. On the strategic and operational level, control
of the electromagnetic spectrum and strategic deployments are
also important functions. These and other functions will be suc­
cessively described in this document in the context of a specific
type of military operation. Taken collectively, these functions ag­
gregate to represent the operational capabilities of troops.

**Principles of military operations**

75. **Initiative and decisiveness. Every commander must do the**

maximum to preserve initiative, which significantly determines
the nature of operations, combat and other military activities.
He/she must therefore have a possibility to have reserves avai­
lable whenever possible, to set priorities and to assign tasks to


-----

the units regardless of their nationality. The purpose (essence and
goal) of the commander’s activity must be the ability and also
spirit to react first in every situation and force your will upon the
opponent or parties involved in the conflict. At the same time,
they should be aware that in some situations (peace operations in
particular), patience is indispensable.

76. **Main effort concentration. The operational commander has**

to use assigned or his own means effectively with reference to
combat capabilities of subordinated forces and the adversary’s
abilities as well. In every phase of the operation he has to specify
where to focus the main effort, in the view of space and time. For
this, it is necessary to concentrate in the given area, the grouping
of forces and means required to achieve the objective.

_The possibility and capability to achieve the desired and timely_
_concentration of forces depends not only on their mobility, but_
_as well on the flexible and resilient system of command, ensu­_
_ring incessancy of their control in the course of the operation._
_Implementation of the principle requires mutual harmonization_
_of force, space and time factors, as the relationship between_
_them changes constantly during the operation depending on the_
_development of the situation. That requires among others the_
_ability to quickly recognize qualitative changes in the situation,_
_to accept relevant decisions and push them purposefully during_
_the operation._

77. **Effective use of forces is closely related to the main effort con­**

centration principle. Usually there will never be enough force
and means to conduct operations. Therefore the commander
determines when, where and how he will concentrate troops
effort to achieve success and what forces he will use, which
allows him, a�er weighing possible risks, to admit the existence
of his own weak spots and to detach the minimum needed force
for secondary tasks. Mutually coordinated activities with other
Services possibly with the allies and civilian population too, all
contribute to the economical use of force.


_The possibility and capability to achieve the desired and timely_
_concentration of forces depends not only on their mobility, but_
_as well on the flexible and resilient system of command, ensu­_
_ring incessancy of their control in the course of the operation._
_Implementation of the principle requires mutual harmonization_
_of force, space and time factors, as the relationship between_
_them changes constantly during the operation depending on the_
_development of the situation. That requires among others the_
_ability to quickly recognize qualitative changes in the situation,_
_to accept relevant decisions and push them purposefully during_
_the operation._


-----

78. **Liberty of action is given, among others, by authorizations, ent­**

rusted to the operation commander by NATO military commi�ee
strategic regulations, ROE during the command of national con­
tingents (free hand to act independently within an assigned task)
and the possibility to realise his own responsibility (influenced
by the quantity of forces and means available to him). At the
same time, this principle represents the requirement, during the
task accomplishment, to preserve the ability to accept decisions,
to control the operation day and night, to maintain the required
amount of uncommi�ed forces and to have them available.

79. **Unity of effort is a result of implementing the unity of command**

principle, which requires commanders to coordinate organic and
supporting force activities and means, to appreciate their capabi­
lities, to delegate responsibility to the lower command levels and
to harmonize their command and control approaches to achieve
defined objectives. An important prerequisite to ensure the unity
of effort in combined operations is the transparency of national
interests and interests of national contingents. Therefore the
AFCR’s commanders must provide the higher commander with
all necessary information and maintain close cooperation with
commanders of other national contingents.


-----

80. **Objective. The use of military force in operations must lead to**

achieving real and the most precisely defined objectives. On the
political-strategic command and control level, the objective is
articulated by describing the end (desired) state, which results
from the military operation or campaign and the plan to achieve
it. Commanders at all levels must know this objective. On the tac­
tical level, the success of this principle assumes the most precise
comprehension of the higher level commander’s plan.

81. **Simplicity. Simple, but rapid and forceful action, is the most**

certain way to achieve the objective. Complicated plans and their
associated complicated and coordination-demanding activities
increase the probability of failure.

82. **Force protection represents the aggregate of measures, of indivi­**

dual or collective character, active or passive, pre-arranged and
executed during the operation’s duration to maintain the combat
capability of one’s own troops.

83. **Morale status of troops is the state of members of units (formati­**

ons, armed forces components), expressing their morale qualities,
primarily the ability to follow generally accepted principles and
norms of conduct when achieving an operation’s objectives.
Motivation and determination of armed forces members con­
stitute one of the fundamental prerequisites of success during
deployment.

84. **Sustainability** represents the troop’s ability to preserve the

required combat power level during the whole time, necessary
for task accomplishment. Current operations are o�en conducted
for a long period of time and at great distances from the CR’s
territory. They constitute extraordinary demands on logistic sup­
port, replacement flow and other support, including the necessity
of troop rotation. Success in achieving the operation’s objectives
will, among others, depend on whether the AFCR’s dispatched
units retain the required amount of combat capabilities for the
operation’s duration.

**Application of forces**

85. Military operations differ from political solutions to the conflict

by the application of force or by the menace of using it. The
CR‘s rule of law, commitments stemming from international
law, particularly commitments stemming from international
humanitarian law, ROE, further orders, military regulations, and
political-strategic directions form the legal basis for conducting
the AFCR military operations.

86. International humanitarian law defines these fundamental prin­

ciples of combat conduct: necessity, adequacy, reasonable force,
permissibility and legitimate targets.

   - **Necessity means, that the force can be exclusively used only**

when it is vitally important to defeat the opponent.

   - **Adequacy means that the force and level of destruction must**

be reduced to the absolute minimum necessary to defeat the
opponent. This principle prevents or limits collateral damage
to the maximum extent possible and requires that force appli­
cation not exceed military requirements.

   - **Reasonable force means, that combat means or combat me­**

thods causing excessive injury or unnecessary suffering can‘t
be used;

   - **Permissibility means, that only combat means not prohibited**

by international law or usage can be used;

   - **Legitimate targets mean, that under all circumstances it is**

necessary to distinguish between military targets and civilian
population and objects.

87. ROE are rules, elaborated within operational planning and

approved by the relevant political (military) authority, specifying
the circumstances and restrictions, under which the units dep­
loyed in a military operation initiate or continue combat action.
ROE inform the commander of the degree of independence he
has in deciding to use force while fulfilling assigned tasks. They
constitute the basis for executing the military operation and are
used in all phases of military operations or armed conflicts, both
according to Article 5 or outside Article 5 of the North-Atlantic


-----

Treaty. ROE define the rules every member of the armed forces
in a military operation must adhere to regardless of his rank and
function.

88. **Self-defence. ROE do not limit the right of a commander to use all**

means and to take appropriate measures for the self-defence of his
units or other allied (coalition) units, possibly civilian population
directly threatened. This refers to self-defence against a hostile act
or an immediate hostile intent. In these cases too, it is necessary to
respect the principles of international humanitarian law.

_A hostile act is an a�ack or other use of force by foreign troops,_
_armed groups and terrorist units against one’s own or allied_
_troops, NATO member states or the territory under their ju­_
_risdiction and, under specific circumstances, against non-allied_
_states. a hostile act also refers to the application of force to limit or_
_obstruct the deployment of one’s own or allied forces and as well_
_the hindrance of the evacuation of personnel or vital property. If_
_a hostile act develops, every member of the armed forces has the_
_right to apply proportional force in self-defence with all available_
_means, permi�ed by the international humanitarian law._

_Hostile intent refers to the threat of force by foreign troops, armed_
_groups and terrorist units against one’s own or allied troops,_
_NATO member states or the territory under their jurisdiction_
_and, under specific circumstances, against non-allied states. If_
_hostile intent is detected, the right of self-defence can be applied._
_By the international humanitarian law, permi�ed means may be_
_employed to deter or neutralise the adversary._

**Operational planning**

89. Operational planning is the process, during which the operational

commander elaborates military-strategic operation’s objectives
into the complex plan of the execution, harmonized in time and
place. Nowadays, operational planning is done through two
independent, but mutually interrelated processes[6]: Advanced

6NATO operational system is described in details in NATO Military Commi�ee
document MC133/3 (Procedures for Approval and Promulgation of Major
NATO Commander’s and CUSRPG’s Operational Planning Documents).


_A hostile act is an a�ack or other use of force by foreign troops,_
_armed groups and terrorist units against one’s own or allied_
_troops, NATO member states or the territory under their ju­_
_risdiction and, under specific circumstances, against non-allied_
_states. a hostile act also refers to the application of force to limit or_
_obstruct the deployment of one’s own or allied forces and as well_
_the hindrance of the evacuation of personnel or vital property. If_
_a hostile act develops, every member of the armed forces has the_
_right to apply proportional force in self-defence with all available_
_means, permi�ed by the international humanitarian law._

_Hostile intent refers to the threat of force by foreign troops, armed_
_groups and terrorist units against one’s own or allied troops,_
_NATO member states or the territory under their jurisdiction_
_and, under specific circumstances, against non-allied states. If_
_hostile intent is detected, the right of self-defence can be applied._
_By the international humanitarian law, permi�ed means may be_
_employed to deter or neutralise the adversary._


-----

Planning and Crisis Response Planning. Operational planning is
the continual process, which is done throughout the conduct of
the operation till the end of the operation.

90. CR’s military-strategic control level authorities take part in the

operational planning process either directly in the multinational
headquarters staff or through liaison authorities. The coordinati­
on of planning activities is done by the Joint Operational Centre,
MoD. From this perspective, operational planning has two
levels:

   - participation in formulating the operation’s strategic objective

of the allied (coalition) formation emerging from the member­
ship in the alliance (coalition);

  - planning of allocation and participation of AFCR’s forces and

means in the operation.

91. The AFCR’s national contingent commander takes part in the

operational planning process and elaborates the plans of combat
and support.

**Command and control in operations**

92. **Command and control is the process of purposeful activity of**

command authorities (commanders and staffs) to task and direct
organic and assigned forces and means to most effectively use
all available sources during planning, organisation, coordination
and conducting activities to fulfill assigned objectives in the
specified time limits with minimal strain and minimal losses.
Command and control must be firm, flexible, continual and
maintain operational security.

   - **Firmness** of the command lies in the consistent implementa­

tion of the elaborated and reasoned decision. It is achieved by
the timely decision taking, precise formulation of tasks to sub­
ordinates, timely delivery of tasks to executors and consistent
monitoring of fulfillment.

   - **Command flexibility lies in the constant gathering and proces­**

sing of information, anticipating situation developments and
flexibly responding to the changes. Flexibility is achieved by
timely decision-making and giving tasks to subordinates and


-----

primarily operationally (concurrently) specifying tasks based
on analysis of likely situational development.

   - **Continuity of command consists in constant force control, in**

maintaining continual cooperation and mutual awareness. It
is achieved by appropriate deploying of command posts, their
timely redeployment, maintaining reliable communications
and assigning the command systems and communication
protection measures required against adversary activities, as
well as fast restoration if they are disrupted.

   - **Operational security lies in the concealing of all measures**

related to operation preparations and control. It is achieved
by limiting the number of people who acquaint themselves
with the operation (combat) plan or commander’s decision,
the covert command posts deployment and redeployment,
the consistent observance of classified information protection
principles, using information protection means during their
transfer, the observance of communication security principles,
camouflage and disinformation.

93. **Command** represents the process, by which the commander

makes decisions and transfers his will to his subordinates. The
commander has the authority, responsibility and the duty to act,
or to freely decide not to do so, for the purpose of accomplishing
objectives specified by the superior. Command is also the art of
gaining and using available information in a creative way while
skillfully and effectively motivating and directing subordinates
to achieve assigned tasks.

94. **The commander** should know the moral and professional

qualities of his immediate subordinates, command them perso­
nally and provide them the opportunity to be creative and take
initiative; know the situation, combat capabilities of his troops
(formation, unit), supposed capabilities and probable intent of
the adversary; make timely decisions and consistently execute
the decisions, task his subordinates, coordinate their activities
and provide all-round support; personally direct the combat and
according to the situation development, particularize his deci­
sions; be in the decisive situations on the most important place
or direction and influence the course of the combat by available


-----

forces and means; inform his superiors of the situation for his
subordinated forces and means, of his substantive decisions and
submit the support and supply requirements. The commander
must know the norms of international humanitarian law and be
able to apply them in concrete activity conditions.

95. He always informs his chief of staff of his decisions, orders

issued and instructions. During the command, the commander is
supported by his staff.

96. **The staff’s duty is to prepare proposals for the commander,**

ensure implementation of his decisions and provide subordinate
commanders with support. The staff itself has no authority, it is
derived from the commander and is executed in his name.

97. The commander’s activities differ according to the command level

and his responsibilities. The higher level commander commands
through subordinate commanders, usually indirect (according
to OPCON principles). The units are generally commanded
indirectly. On the tactical level, the lowest-level commanders
command their subordinates directly (according to FULLCOM
or OPCOM principles).

98. **News media. The news media have a great influence on prepara­**

tion and conduct of military operations. When dealing with the
media, armed forces members should be aware of the following:

  - only the commander or his authorized representative has the

right to provide information on the operation;

  - while considering operational security, soldiers only provide

the media with precisely delimited but true information;

  - it is expected of reporters that they supply their product on

time. If they do not receive information, they will go looking
for it, and this will endanger their mission;

  - during contact with the media, soldiers limit themselves to

their functional area.

99. **Style of command follows from the concrete situation in the ope­**

rations (combat) area, tasks, command level and familiarity with
the subordinates. The commanders should exercise a command


-----

style that motivates subordinates, enables them to apply the full
extent of their capabilities in the sphere of their authority and
responsibility and assures the necessary command flexibility.
The main method which enables this, is the decentralisation and
**authority delegation. It comes from the experience, that under**
conditions of chaos and conflict, decisions should be taken on the
level that executes the tasks and is directly involved in the combat
action.

_Decentralisation (delegation of authority) does not reduce the_
_commander’s full responsibility. Devolution of authority does not_
_release the commander from the responsibility, he still remains_
_responsible for his actions and actions of his subordinates. This_
_means that he has to monitor the execution of orders (instructi­_
_ons, tasks) and, if need be, intervene himself._

_In some situations this method is not suitable. For example, the_
_activity of subordinate units can have great political importance;_
_the higher-level commander can exercise the direct command_
_method. It arises from the rule, that the commander bearing_
_immediate responsibility, has the option of choosing the command_
_method, which he considers appropriate._

100. Command and control principles. The following principles

apply for preparation and conduct of operations:

   - **The principle of a commander’s full authority comes from**

the fact, that the commander is the decisive person in the
command process. Commanders on each level are invested
with relevant authorities and bear personal responsibility for
fulfilling assigned tasks and their own decisions. They direct
the subordinates in accord with specified rights and duties.

   - **The principle of systematic gathering and evaluating of**

**information is required for the commander’s decision-making,**
and a subordinate’s control follows from the need of rational
weighing (considering) and sorting the huge amount of
various quality information, which is the beginning of every
decision-making process heading towards the acceptance of
one possible solution variant.


_Decentralisation (delegation of authority) does not reduce the_
_commander’s full responsibility. Devolution of authority does not_
_release the commander from the responsibility, he still remains_
_responsible for his actions and actions of his subordinates. This_
_means that he has to monitor the execution of orders (instructi­_
_ons, tasks) and, if need be, intervene himself._

_In some situations this method is not suitable. For example, the_
_activity of subordinate units can have great political importance;_
_the higher-level commander can exercise the direct command_
_method. It arises from the rule, that the commander bearing_
_immediate responsibility, has the option of choosing the command_
_method, which he considers appropriate._


-----

- **The unity of command principle reflects the fact, that an es­**

sential precondition for achieving success is unity of thought,
approaches and executing plans by commanders and staffs on
all command levels. This unity is achieved by clearly defined
operational objectives and intentions, exactly specified rela­
tionships and authorities of individual command levels and
a commanders personal responsibility for realistic specified
tasks accomplishment. Mutual connectivity of information and
communication systems is the condition for achieving unity
of command. The commander is the fundamental unifying
element in the command and control system.

- **The mutual respect principle plays an important role in**

multinational operations. That requires the command of
fundamental unifying rules, procedures and activities, mutual
information flow, transparency in decision making and activi­
ty, knowledge and respect of allied units’ capabilities and the
ability to communicate in the English language.

- **The principle of consistency, determination and persistence**

in implementing adopted decisions means that any comman­
ders’ decision must be executed consistently, completely, reso­
lutely and determinedly to overcome all difficulties, troubles
and unexpected situation changes, and last but not least, also
tirelessly and tenaciously, particularly when vanquishing an
adversary.

- The principles of being highly organised, agile and creative in

command and staff work respects the complexity of current
combat and the growing requirements on commanders and
in particular their staff’s work. The ability to respond appro­
priately even in conditions when the staff’s structure and its
activity is disrupted is the essence of being highly organised.
The ability to respond to sudden situational changes, find
the optimal solution, creatively adopt even unconventional
solutions, and respond in complicated situations to effectively
influence that developing situation is the essence of agility.

- **The military decision-making process principle consists**

of considering and formulating possible courses of action,
assessing them according to unambiguous and specific
(quantifiable) criteria, and subsequently adopting the course
of action that seems optimal in the given circumstances.


-----

- **The principle of centralization of command follows from**

the existence of the supreme and responsible authority of the
commander who is invested with necessary authorities for
planning and control of an operation. Its application enables
to enforce unity of will, unity of activity and speed of action,
particularly in a complicated situation, but at the same time, it
enables the commander to delegate necessary authority to his
subordinates.


_This principle is o�en presented as a command centralization_
_and performance decentralization principle. It follows the_
_commander‘s decision to delegate some of his authorities to his_
_subordinates. The executive element carrying out the task is_
_free to choose the method of executing the task. Commanders_
_must have enough freedom to elaborate their own plans to fulfill_
_a superior’s intent. That requires flexibility of thinking, firmness_
_in decision-making and confidence in subordinates. Shi�ing_
_the level of decision-making as low as possible creates suitable_
_conditions for taking decisions relevant to the circumstances, in_
_conditions of fast changes in current operations. The commander_
_who has delegated this authority to his subordinates still bears_
_the full responsibility to his superior for achieving operational_
_objectives according to the above stated command centralization_
_principle. The extent of authority delegation always depends on_
_the commander’s decision and comes from actual circumstances_
_and situations._


-----

101. Leadership represents the commander’s ability to motivate,

persuade and gain people in his vicinity for active involvement
in achieving common, assigned, or in the near future, expected
tasks. The art of leading is one of the most important qualities
every commander should have if he is to command successfully.

_There is no recipe for leadership. Each commander will motivate_
_his soldiers in different ways, respecting his personal capabilities,_
_charisma and actual situation._

_The choice for mission command places demands upon the style of_
_leadership. It is influenced by the acknowledgment of the decisive_
_role of man on the ba�lefield. Military operations depend on the_
_individual qualities of the soldier; high morale, mental flexibility,_
_initiative, self-confidence, team spirit, and last but not least,_
_physical and mental endurance._

102. Decision-making process. Time and information are the most

important factors in the command and control process. If the ini­
tiative is to be gained or maintained, it is necessary to get ahead
of the adversary also, in making decisions. The decision-making
process is understood as the selection of an optimal solution from
possible alternative courses of action, which are feasible in the
given situation. The decision-making process during operational
preparation and conduct is influenced in particular by the time
and information available to the commander or that he has to


-----

obtain, and the task which needs to be accomplished. The decisi­
on-making process, which coincides with operation conduct and
preparation, includes the commander and staff’s entire decision­
-making activity from information (task) acquisition from the
superior commander until decision adoption. At all command
levels, it has a similar course and characteristics. Its factual
content, extent and method are adjusted to correspond to a given
command level’s capabilities, situation, characteristics of the task
and the time available.

103. Operation control consists of purposeful action by the comman­

der and the staff on the directed troops to achieve an operation’s
objective and includes: collection of situational information;
analyzing collected information and situation evaluation; speci­
fying the activity objectives and tasks to subordinates; arranging
and specifying coordination between subordinates; organizing
cooperation with non-governmental, governmental and inter­
national organizations, continuous supplying of the troops;
informing superiors, subordinates, concurrently acting troops
and neighboring forces on the situation and commands given by
the commander; and controlling subordinate unit activities.

_The commander and his staff constantly command subordinate_
_units. The activity of the commander and the staff consists,_
_firstly, in constantly balancing expected combat developments_
_against actual progress and regulating the activity of engaged_
_units in such situations where the combat development no longer_
_corresponds to the adopted plan; in issuing orders, commands,_
_instructions and signals and in se�ing such measures through_
_which the commander responds to the changing conditions and_
_operation developments and coordinates the action of subordina­_
_tes to achieve the operation objective._

104. In the command and control process, the communication and in­

formation systems (CIS) are widely used. Their organisation and
operation is ensured by signal troops. CIS significance has shown
unprecedented increase and their development is the decisive
prerequisite for achieving information supremacy. Information
supremacy is achieved by integrated information infrastructure,
based on CIS and its entire sensor systems, operational-tactical


_The commander and his staff constantly command subordinate_
_units. The activity of the commander and the staff consists,_
_firstly, in constantly balancing expected combat developments_
_against actual progress and regulating the activity of engaged_
_units in such situations where the combat development no longer_
_corresponds to the adopted plan; in issuing orders, commands,_
_instructions and signals and in se�ing such measures through_
_which the commander responds to the changing conditions and_
_operation developments and coordinates the action of subordina­_
_tes to achieve the operation objective._


-----

command and control systems and weapons systems. Unlimited
access to the information, timely knowledge of the current
situation and unified comprehension of a commander’s intent
enable units to achieve synergy in troop activities and to increase
operational effectiveness. Network based operational principles
are decisive for CIS development in the AFCR.

**Maneuver and fire power**

105. Success in military operations is achieved by proper combination

of manoeuvre and fire power. In peace support operations, the
role of fire power is usually less, however, the readiness to use
force (or the threat of potential use of force) contributes signi­
ficantly to the peace forces effectively executing their mandate.
Maneuver and fire power are closely related. Fire is one form of
manoeuvre, which enables other forms of manoeuvre.

106. Maneuver serves for the deployment or redeployment of forces

on the ba�lefield and for ge�ing into the operational (combat)
composition, which creates optimal conditions for obtaining the
most advantageous position to accomplish the mission, utilizing
all geopolitical aspects. In the case of peace support operations,
we usually use the term movement or redeployment instead of
manoeuvre.


_Manoeuvre is the most important means for implementing the_
_concentration of main effort principles and economy of force._
_During combat operations, manoeuvre facilitates another basic_
_principle – surprise, during peace support operations it serves as_
_a means of the freedom of movement principle application._

_Effective manoeuvre requires reliable information and its success_
_depends upon correctly identifying and assessing the influence_
_of individual factors such as weather conditions, terrain, com­_
_munication nets (roads, bridges, trafficability of open terrain),_
_existence of various movement obstacles (for example streams of_
_refugees or population) etc._

_Manoeuvre is also heavily influenced by the mobility of one’s own_
_units and means, but it is not limited only to ground warfare._
_Airmobility is an important prerequisite for manoeuver success_
_in current operations._


-----

107. Fire power represents the operational grouping’s ability to deliver

direct and indirect fire on targets in the adversary’s operational
(combat) composition by organic and support fire means, thus
neutralising the fighting potential of the enemy. The intention
of fire power application in operations is not to systematically
destroy the enemy by all means, but to break his morale, cohesion
and the ability to put up resistance.

108. The application of fire power must be coordinated at all

command levels. Fire power can only be applied to the best of
its potential if its application in an operation is planned and
managed at one location and if the application is, to the contrary,
carried out in a decentralised way.

**Protection of forces**

109. Force protection is the sum of the measures to preserve or

possibly to recover the fighting potential of the troops so that it
can be applied at a decisive time and place. Protection measures
should be carried out at all command levels continuously and
simultaneously. Protection measures are implemented according
to the needs of the specific situation, possibilities and capabilities
of units, large units and operational formation components.

110. General measures are the basics of force protection and are

implemented continuously, under all conditions of operation
(combat) preparation and conduct. Their extent and quality
dictate the protection level. They are implemented by troops
using one’s own means and force. Special measures are specific,
are established for protection against specific enemy means and
are usually implemented by specialised services.

111. Force protection is established by a whole range of general

and special measures, both active, passive and warning. Most
important are: NBC weapons protection, deception, operational
security, direct support; protection against undesirable effects of
one’s own weapons; protection of communication and informati­
on systems against disruption; fire protection; health protection;
police protection.


-----

112. NBC weapons protection. The existence of weapons of mass

destruction (NBC weapons), and their covert proliferation,
represents the threat, that nuclear or other weapons of mass
destruction can be used to achieve interest objectives. Escape of
industrial harmful substances caused by the combat activity or
industrial accident can also have a distinct impact on operation
conduct. These threats require that all the CR‘s armed forces
components be equipped with protective means and be able to
implement NBC protection measures at any time. Special em­
phasis is more and more laid on the self-sufficiency of the lower
command levels and on the standardization of NBC weapons
protection procedures within multinational forces.

113. If NBC weapons use is threatened, commanders and staffs must

prepare and conduct operations (combat) so that a transition
to operations in an NBC environment can be carried out with
minimal loss of combat capabilities and minimal changes to the
original plans.

114. Deception is the purposeful action of friendly troops consisting

of various measures aimed at deceiving the opponent by manipu­
lation, distortion or counterfeiting the facts. The deception’s aim
is to force the incorrect notion of the situation and activities of
friendly troops and their facilities upon the adversary and make
him respond disadvantageously to his interests. The deception
can be carried out at the strategic, operational and tactical level.

115. Operational security consists of concealing all activities related

to operational preparation. In essence, it is a process using multi­
ple measures with passive or active means. During an operation,
it is not possible to conceal all troop activities. All measures taken
to ensure operational security must therefore be focused at those
activities, which could signal an upcoming operation, and reveal
its details or vulnerabilities.

116. Local security consists of measures taken to prevent friendly

troops from an unexpected a�ack by the adversary. According to
the nature of the executed tasks, the troops are supported during
a march (movement), by the protection on a march, in combat by
the combat security and in non-combat deployment by the sentry


-----

support. Apart from this, the commanders habitually organise
direct support made of observers, sentries, guards and stand-by
fire means.

117. Force protection measures against undesirable effects of one’s

**own weapons include: measures against accidental killing or**
injury by fire from friendly weapon systems; organization and
fire control; adjustment control of weapons and other equipment
and fire control parameters, movement tempo and movement
direction (manoeuvres) observance, determination of safety lines
(areas), electromagnetic coexistence and measures for maintai­
ning discipline and organization.

118. Protection of communication and information systems against

**disruption is organized within the passive electronic warfare**
(EW) measures to preserve the functioning of friendly command
and control systems as well as reconnaissance and weapon
systems. Electronic warfare deals with the measures to prevent
the adversary from using the electromagnetic spectrum and acti­
vities for efficient use of an electromagnetic spectrum by friendly
forces.

_Electronic warfare is the inseparable part of all operations. It_
_includes three parts: electronic support, electronic effect and_
_electronic protection. Thus, it has three functions-support,_
_offensive and defensive._

119. Fire protection includes: preventive anti-fire measures; warning

troops of fire and advising of safe incendiary weapons use, force
protection measures in the area of conflagration and measures
to guide troops out from the endangered places; assessment of
consequences from incendiary weapons use by the adversary;
and extinguishing fire.

120. Health protection includes the set of measures, organized by the

commanders at all levels to create optimal conditions for health
care and providing first aid. Commanders, at tactical command
levels in particular, must be aware of the fact that the base of
protection is the readiness of the individual and the unit, which
enables to apply all available means, ways and capabilities of


_Electronic warfare is the inseparable part of all operations. It_
_includes three parts: electronic support, electronic effect and_
_electronic protection. Thus, it has three functions-support,_
_offensive and defensive._


-----

medical protection, starting from self-help and mutual help on
the ba�lefield, through other pre-medical assistance and first
aid up to the specialized medical support. The consequences of
low self-protection readiness can’t be counterbalanced by any
superior element’s measures.

121. Police protection includes ensuring good order and discipline in

military facilities and areas, gathering and evaluating the security
situation by the troops, crime prevention measures, crime dete­
ction and confinement of the offenders, and a search for soldiers
and military material. It also includes the protection of command
posts, places and ma�ers of special significance, participation
in preventing sabotage, reconnaissance and other groups of the
adversary and an organisation of gathering and escorting of war
prisoners.

122. In non-combat operations, the force protection measures are im­

plemented according to the specific situation and in some cases
they may apply to civilian populations too.

**Military intelligence**

123. For the planning and the conduct of operations, commanders

and their staffs need to have the most precise understanding of
the adversary and the area of the operation. Intelligence staffs
and organizations are actively involved in the planning, conduct
and termination of the operations processes. **The major task**
**of military intelligence is to support the commander in the**
situation evaluation process and its potential development. At
the same time, it deals with other supporting tasks in preparation
and force protection, targeting processes, support of information,
psychological and special operations and other tasks of the given
command level. a national unit deployed in a multinational ope­
ration can be supported by national military intelligence or sup­
porting military intelligence components. Tasks, their quantity
and structure may change, but the extent of task accomplishment
is limited by the capabilities and means of intelligence.

124. Intelligence staff and organizations perform functions, which are

specific to them, and no other part of the staff performs them.


-----

Specifically, indication and warning, intelligence preparation of
the ba�lefield, detection of the adversary’s composition, intelli­
gence estimate and target description including the evaluation
of destruction effects. Intelligence performs tasks assigned by
the commander through combination and improvement of these
functions.

125. Intelligence functions can only be carried out when there is

sufficient information, gained on the basis of tasking the sources
and agencies by the commander. These sources can be not only
reconnaissance units and passive surveillance and electronic war­
fare units, but generally any unit on the ba�lefield. Intelligence
staff does not process information only from own sources, but to
a large degree it uses information and intelligence from superior
level, concurrently acting troops, neighbors and intelligence
services. The organisation of intelligence activity must ensure the
maximal intelligence support with minimal requirements on the
own infrastructure.

126. Transfer of information and intelligence between sources,

intelligence staff and end users depends on the capabilities of
communication and information systems, their ability to inter­
connect the intelligence activities, monitoring, target description
and reconnaissance.

**Support of operations**

127. Support of troops in operations represents the sum of measures,

which create conditions for successfully accomplishing the obje­
ctive. They are formed by measures for personnel and material
support, functional area expert activities and command posts
support. These measures are organized and established within
personnel, medical, logistic, engineer, chemical, police, geogra­
phical and hydrometeorological support functions by either
organic forces and means or in the form of the support received
for this purpose from assigned forces and means.

128. Personnel support of troops in an operation includes the sum

of measures taken to ensure continuous filling of all functional
slots in an operationally deployed unit by military personnel


-----

with the required level of professional, morale, physical and
other preparedness to fulfill required tasks in an operation.
Personnel support plays a significant role particularly in case
of major operations (based on duration and deployed forces
and means extent) and resulting necessity to ensure periodic
rotation of deployed personnel and continuous replacement flow
(compensation) for suffered or possible losses. Application of this
requirement influences both the personnel acquisition system
and the system of preparation and training of the newly recruited
military professionals, in the view of the time consuming process
of their selection, preparation and training.

129. Medical support in operations includes the sum of measures ens­

uring the timely development of a medical care and evacuation
system as well as the system of hygienic and anti-epidemic sup­
port and the protection system against combat biological agents
in the necessary size and structure. The decisive principle of the
medical support is to bring the medical help as close as possible
to the operating units and ensure maximal help with minimum
delay.

130. Medical support organisation in operation is based on four

phases:

   - **Level 1 field medical facilities – Role (Level) 1 are the organic**

elements of ba�alions (formations) and their primary task is
moving casualties from the ba�lefield to a dressing station
and ensuring they receive, under physician’s supervision,
immediate lifesaving measures and stabilisation of basic life­
-sustaining functions, so they are capable of further transport
to higher levels.

   - **Level 2 field medical facilities – Role (Level) 2 – are an organic**

part of mechanised brigades (or brigade formations) and their
primary task is to transfer casualties from dressing station Role
1 to Role 2 facilities. Surgical treatments are carried out here
and a short-term hospitalization up to two days, a�er which
the patient returns to his unit or is transferred to a higher
phase. Medical care on the Role 2 level may include as well,
measures of preventive medicine, psychiatry or psychology.


-----

   - **Level 3 field medical facilities – Role (Level) 3 – executes**

a secondary care in the extent given by the operational-tactical
situation, which carries out the evacuation of medical losses
from Role 2 facilities to Role 3 facilities and participates in
evacuations to Role 4 facilities. Medical care provided here in­
cludes various clinical branches (according to the character of
the operation), including primary surgery (life and extremities
saving surgery) and relevant diagnostic branches. The average
time of temporary hospitalization is usually 7 days. Then, the
patient goes back to his unit or is moved to Role 4 facilities,
stationary medical facilities on the territory of the state.

131. Logistic support lies in coordinated planning, directing and

conducting all activities and services, related to:

  - procuring, delivery and supply, maintenance, recovery, ma­

king full use of the transport means, evacuation, repair and
calibration of the equipment and material

  - movements and transport of personnel and all military mate­

rial;

   - providing logistic service in the field of personnel welfare, fire

protection and ba�lefield cleaning.

It is ensured by the measures and means appointed to support
combat activities in the operational area and in peacetime locati­
ons, for which the required logistic infrastructure is established.

132. The AFCR deployed forces are provided in an operation with

logistic support of levels I. and II.:

   - level I. logistic support is provided by organic logistics support

units of deployed units (formations).

  - level II. logistic support is provided either by the national

support element – NSE, or by the multinational integrated
logistic units.

  - If a small number is deployed in a multinational operation

contingent (up to 120), it is possible to organise level I. and le­
vel II. logistic support directly by a supporting element created
from level I. and level II. elements.


-----

133. Within level I., logistic support is organized as follows: transport

and preservation of combat and other prescribed stock, reple­
nishment of expended or compensation of damaged military
material and other material possessions based on higher level
command decision, ordinary repair of military material and the
provision of logistic service.

134. Engineer support includes engineer measures to support friend­

ly troops movement; to limit an opponent’s activities; to preserve
combat capabilities of the troops and common engineer support
measures. Engineer support is understood as the participation of
engineer corps formations and units on combat tasks achieve­
ment and it includes the whole range of activities, from providing
engineer recommendations to completing the most complicated
engineer measures to benefit troop activities.

135. Chemical support is comprised of measures to create required

conditions for formations, units and facilities to accomplish their
objectives during activities in the radioactively or toxically conta­
minated areas and participate in their defence. It includes radia­
tion and chemical situation monitoring; protection of personnel
and equipment in the formations and units (facilities) against
the effects of radioactive and toxic agents; decontamination of
formations, units (facilities), terrain, roads and buildings; and
the use of smoke. Chemical support measures are implemented
by formations and a units own force, only the most complicated
and specific chemical support measures, which require special
preparation of the troops and the use of special equipment, are
implemented by the chemical corps.

136. Police support. The military police, during operations (within the

composition of the AFCR’s troops or independently) carry out the
following functions: traffic incident of military transport means
investigation; contact with host nation authorities; intelligence
gathering; route reconnaissance and control; movement support;
tracing missing members of one’s own troops; criminal offence
commi�ed by armed forces members investigation; patrol service
in the operations area; traffic service; personnel and material
protection; and specialized operations of the military police.


-----

137. Geographical support is the sum of measures and activities

that provide commanders, staffs, formations and units with the
geographical data and information necessary for their action.
Geographical support includes geographical preparation of
the territory, consisting of permanent military-geographical
data collection from the CR’s territory and areas of NATO geo­
graphical interest, supplying geographical products and data,
providing updated supplements and specific information related
to probable ground force actions, military-geographical training
of commanders, staffs and troops, and also advice and expertise
in the geographic field.

138. Hydrometeorological support is the sum of measures to prepare

timely data and comprehensively evaluate the effects of meteo­
rological and hydrological conditions on combat activities, troop
movements, physical and mental condition of the troops and
their logistic support.

**Civilian-military cooperation (CIMIC) in operations**

139. CIMIC is the coordination and cooperation activity between the

operation commander and to his subordinated forces and civilian
environment, which covers the local population, local authorities


-----

and home rule representatives, as well as international, national
and non-governmental organizations and agencies. The aim of
CIMIC is to ensure and maintain all-round cooperation of the
civilian population and institutions in the commander‘s operatio­
nal area in order to create civilian-military conditions, which offer
him the biggest possible moral, material and tactical advantages
when fulfilling (achieving) the operational objectives.

140. CIMIC tasks are realised in three basic functional areas:

a. cooperation with civilian authorities and organizations, that

is both local self-government, and international and national
governmental and non-governmental organizations;

  - help to the civilian population, provided in accord with mili­

tary operational objectives. Help may include use of military
sources, information, personnel, material, equipment (wea­
ponry), communication equipment, specialists, and personnel
training etc.;

  - one’s own forces requirements support. In this respect, the

point is that military forces can be during the operation,
partially dependent on civilian sources and information from
the civilian sector.

141. CIMIC is organized in all kinds of operations, including combat

operations. For practical applications of civilian-military coope­
ration, it is important to always use the basic humanitarian prin­
ciples, upon which the majority of humanitarian organizations
are based: humanity, impartiality and neutrality.

#### CHAPTER 5

 COMBAT OPERATIONS


-----

#### COMBAT OPERATIONS

142. According to the way force is used, combat operations are divi­

ded into offensive and defensive operations. Special, information
and psychological operations can be conducted within these
operations.

143. An operational system represents the aggregate of forces, means

and their activities working together and organised to achieve the
operation’s objectives. At the operational and tactical level, the
operations are conducted with the purpose to locate the enemy,
restrain his forces with the aim of divesting him of the initiative,
thwart his intent and defeat him. An operational system must
ensure the operation conduct in contact with the adversary, in
the depth of the adversary‘s composition, rearguard of one’s own
troops and in the system of local, not interconnected combat
compositions.

144. Operations in contact with the adversary. The purpose of the

contact operation, is above all, the ba�le with the adversary using
various means aimed at destroying or capturing the enemy and
thus eliminating critical elements of his combat power. Contact
operations will usually be conducted in a relatively short time
span and shallow depth. Their aim is victory for forces in enemy
contact, where direct and successful actions against the enemy’s
combat power will have immediate and evident effect.

145. Operations in the operational depth of the adversary. The

purpose of operations in depth is to find and entice the enemy,
prevent the enemy from achieving his objectives and reduce his
freedom of action and to create favorable conditions for contact
operations. They are usually conducted at great distance and over
a long time span. Operations in depth, are in essence, offensive in
nature and can lead to contact combat. They are the means for


-----

limiting the opponent’s manoeuvre capabilities by concentrating
on his key vulnerabilities, so he is subsequently not able to effe­
ctively use his combat power.

146. Operations in the rearguard of friendly troops. The objective

of the rearguard operations is to ensure freedom of action by
protecting your own troops, combat operations support and
maintaining the reserve’s freedom of manoeuvre and that of
other units, not directly involved in combat.


_Rearguard operations have a much wider range than logistic_
_operations. They include the following activities:_

_• concentration, movement and protection of the reserves or_
_second echelon units;_

_• redeployment of forces outside the contact area;_

_• support of allied forces on the host nation’s territory;_

_• establishment and protection of bases and the logistics facilities_
_deployment area;_

_• building and protection of communication and information_
_systems;_

_• support and protection of civilian personnel and facilities;_

_• CIMIC including cooperation with local authorities;_

_• reinforcement and troops rotation, replacement flow, restoration_
_and regeneration;_


-----

**Principles of combat operations**

147. Common principles of military operations stated in chapter 4 of

this doctrine, fully apply to combat operations too, for which the
following principles are specific:

  - Mobility represents the armed forces elements capabilities to

redeploy from one place to another one within required time
limits, while maintaining the readiness (capability) to accom­
plish assigned combat tasks.

  - Information superiority. Success in the operation (combat)

will depend on the amount of information and its appropriate
and timely use. This requirement will depend on the level of
communication and information systems and their connection
with the weapon systems. The commanders should endeavor,
based on effective information utilization, to beat the opponent
to his intents, and at the same time to eliminate his access to
information, which he needs for his decisions.

  - Air space domination is one of the air force s most important

tasks during joint operations conduct. It creates conditions in
which land-, air- and naval operations can be conducted.

  - Offensive. In all combat operations, even in those where the

opponent initially has the activity and freedom of action,
commanders at all levels should employ every opportunity to
maintain or gain the initiative and strike the opponent. Success
in the operation depends directly on the troops’ individual and
collective determination to clash with the enemy and break his
will to fight.

  - Combat capabilities preservation represents the requirement,

that commanders should take pains to preserve the combat
capabilities of their troops until combat tasks are completed
and make an effort to achieve the operational objective with
minimal friendly losses. Every opportunity should be taken
to rest the troops and to provide all-round support. Relief
of fight-exhausted units, troop reinforcement and material
replenishment are important for restoring the unit‘s combat
capabilities.

  - Flexibility represents the requirement, that commanders must

always be able, during combat operations, to respond quickly


-----

and in an optimal way to the actual combat situation develo­
pment bearing in mind the necessity of successfully achieving
the final operational objectives.

  - Elimination of the opponent. The operation s objective can be

achieved by physically eliminating the adversary, or bringing
about the loss of his combat capabilities. The significance of
physical elimination of the adversary gradually decreases in
current operations (combat), the alternative is to defeat the
adversary by breaking the cohesion of his activity through
combining manoeuvre and fire power in such a way that he no
longer has opportunity or loses the will to continue combat.

  - Breaking the will to fight. The use of deceptive measures,

psychological warfare, stratagems and selective use of force
and surprise undermines the enemy s will to fight. In this way,
a commander can avoid the large-scale physical destruction of
enemy forces and he can even defeat a stronger enemy.

   - Selective destruction. Current combat activity is not conducted

only to the forward edge of the ba�le area, but throughout the
depth of the enemy s ba�le formation. Selective destruction
of the adversary‘s combat power is based on disruption of
his operational or combat formation elements cohesion, (that
means disruption of functionality of elements ensuring his
mobility, command posts, logistic systems, communication
and information systems etc.), both in contact and in the depth
of his operational (combat) formation.

**Offensive operations**

148. Offensive operations are decisive combat operations. They repre­

sent the aggregate of fights, strikes and manoeuvres, integrated
in terms of objective, tasks, place and time of execution according
to a plan, and executed with the aim to gain and sustain the
initiative, break the enemy’s will to resist, possibly destroy him,
take control over the given area and achieve victory. The a�ack is
characterised by a quick and hidden concentration of forces from
the decisive direction and their surprise application, delivering
blows to the enemy’s weak spots, maintaining constant pressure
on the enemy and flexibly changing a�ack direction and effort.


-----

149. The AFCR’s forces and means must be capable of participating in

offensive operations and their implementation in joint formations
according to NATO allied joint operational principles.

150. According to the extent of preparation preceding the a�ack and

manner of execution, we distinguish the following types of at­
tack: hasty a�ack; deliberate a�ack; a�ack a�er the redeployment
from the depth; countera�ack; meeting engagement and a�ack in
built-up areas.

151. A hasty a�ack is launched and conducted with the aim to prevent

the adversary from organising his defence, inflict decisive losses
upon him; get ahead of him in controlling the advantageous area
and gain other advantages. Surprise effect, speed and power of its
conduct can replace the lack of thorough preparation and other
risks. This type of a�ack makes high demands on the initiative
activity and capabilities of commanders at all levels and their
tactical units, and requires constant cooperation between combat
and combat support forces.

152. A deliberate a�ack is characterised by pre-planned and coordi­

nated employment of all offensive forces and means. Emphasis is
laid on detailed concentration and application of combat power
to the detriment of time, needed for combat organisation. This
a�ack is usually carried out in cases when the adversary was able
to prepare his defence.

153. An a�ack a�er the redeployment from the depth is usually

conducted from the starting or other area, which lies beyond the
range of the majority of the enemy’s artillery. The assault echelon
movement and its gradual deployment to approach-march and
ba�le formations precede the assault itself.

154. A countera�ack with the enemy is usually carried out a�er the

regrouping or relief of the forces, which are in contact with the
enemy. The a�ack is characterised by a quick and hidden con­
centration of forces from the decisive direction and their surprise
application, delivering blows to the enemy’s weak spots, maintai­
ning constant pressure on the enemy and flexibly changing a�ack
direction and effort.


-----

155. The meeting engagement can be characterised as an a�ack car­

ried out against an a�acking or approaching enemy in situations
where the enemy’s formations as well as friendly forces strive to
achieve objectives by offensive activities. The meeting engage­
ment can be carried out by large units or various troop formati­
ons, but in current conditions we can expect the execution also by
formations and units. The objective of the meeting engagement
is usually to destroy an enemy’s offensive formation (forces) in
short time, gain or maintain initiative and create advantageous
conditions for further activity.

156. The a�ack in built-up areas is physically and mentally exhau­

sting and requires extensive time for preparation and application
of special methods and combat techniques. The commanders of
a�acking forces should be aware of the fact, that the opponent
can arrange every city, se�lement or blocks of buildings or factory
facilities in a very short time for all-round defense and put up
strong-willed resistance.


_Increase in built-up areas results partly from spreading of the_
_traditional human se�lements – cities and villages and partly_
_from grouping of these se�lements, where the industrial facilities_
_are usually concentrated too, into urban (dwelling and at the_
_same time industrial ) agglomerations and regions stretching to_
_areas of hundreds km2. Typical of built-up areas is among others,_
_that they are, with respect to high concentrations of civilian_
_population, a suitable hiding place for the opponent’s irregular_
_forces, who can use them to cover-up his own intentions , and_
_thus use built-up areas for all forms of asymetric warfare. Built-_
_up areas therefore significantly influence the activity of offensive_
_forces. Traditional tactics, to bypass built up areas (typical for_
_„classical“ wars era), nowadays no longer leads to success. To_
_the contrary, the operation’s objective can be achieved only when_
_a�acking forces control the activities in these areas._


-----

**Defensive operations**

157. Defensive operations are operations conducted with the aim to

stop the enemy, exhaust his offensive capabilities, keep vitally im­
portant areas and create the conditions for subsequent offensive
action (operation) or conflict termination.

158. The AFCR must be able to provide all-round support and conduct

a defensive operation within joint multinational grouping, carry
out tasks to ensure the CR’s territorial defence and protection
and redeployment and movement of allied forces on its territory,
integrity and sovereignty of the CR. The AFCR can carry out the
defensive operation independently or as a part of a joint multina­
tional operation.

159. Defence is a fundamental, but not decisive, type of combat. By

defence, we can inflict losses upon the opponent and prevent him
from successfully achieving his objectives, hold area, gain time
and create conditions for our own active action, but we can’t win
the combat or the war. For that reason, defensive operations and
defensive combat are considered an important, but not decisive,
form of armed conflict. They require constant search for opportu­
nities to make a transition to the offensive.

160. Defensive operations include not only defensive but also offensi­

ve actions that support and complement the defense to conserve


-----

forces and means to carry out activities on other important
directions or to seize the initiative in areas where conditions are
created to take the initiative.

161. A common objective of the defence is to fight off (stop) a su­

perior enemy, weaken and exhaust his power, keep strategically,
operationally or tactically important areas and objects, gain time
for the reserves or for the redeployment of forces and means to
create conditions for the transition to the offensive.

162. Another objective of the defence can be economy of forces and

means in a certain direction so, that the dominance of forces
could be achieved in a different direction, flank security of the
a�ack echelon or protection of resources, objects or population
etc.

163. Meeting defence requirements and thereby enabling the defence’s

success is achieved in particular by maximal utilization of defen­
sive advantages, skillful camouflage and elimination of defence
weaknesses, disruption of the enemy’s combat preparation and
reduction of his striking power, preservation of defence integrity,
and deception.

164. The AFCR’s forces may participate in directing or conducting

independently the defensive operation in the form of manoeuvre
defence, position defence, delaying operations, depending on the
opponent’s power, composition and intentions, situation, task
and capabilities of one’s own troops, character of the terrain and
the defence operation’s objectives.

165. Maneuver defence lies in skillful defence formation arrangement

and the combination of offensive and defensive actions and
delaying operations. It contemplates (admits) partial territory
loss with the aim, by appropriate combination of offensive and
defensive actions, to inflict heavy losses upon the enemy, exhaust
him, impose our method of activity on him and preserve our own
force for the opponent’s decisive defeat in the depth of our own
formation (defended territory).


-----

166. Position defence is focused on preserving the assigned area

by the fierce defensive activities of the defending troops main
forces in defensive positions and by the activities of small mobile
reserves. Depending on the task, troop capabilities and terrain,
the main effort is placed closer to the forward line. It depends on
the timely detection of the opponent’s main effort and quick and
skillful concentration of forces and means in the most advantage­
ous positions for conducting the defence.

_Both types of the defence may be combined, depending on the si­_
_tuation. In such a case, the static elements of operational (combat)_
_formation are used to hold back, manoeuvre, exhaust and stop_
_the opponent and the dynamic elements to strike, manoeuvre to_
_the flank and rearguard of the opponent and destroy him. The_
_combination of manoeuvre and position defence requires the com­_
_manders to adjust the defence to the given situation and combat_
_force capabilities, without obstinate perseverance in individual_
_types._

167. Delaying combat is the form of defensive combat, in which the

defender, who is under the opponent’s pressure, trades time for
space. The goal is to delay (slow down) and exhaust the enemy’s
offensive forces, gain time and at the same time to preserve the
maximum amount of your own combat force. Delaying combat is
not decisive on the ba�lefield. However, it creates preconditions
for follow-up decisive action, while preserving the flexibility
and the commander’s freedom of action at the deliberate cost of
specific terrain.

**Transitional phases between particular types**

**of combat activity**

168. In current operational practice, various combinations of activities

can be used, which can lead to operational success. It is typical
nowadays, that in one operation area, during one task accom­
plishment, the units will be concurrently fulfilling combat and
non-combat tasks and the adversary can appear in an unexpected
moment or radically change his behavior. This applies particular­
ly in asymmetric operations. The commander will o�en be faced
with a situation where he has to decide to go from the offensive


_Both types of the defence may be combined, depending on the si­_
_tuation. In such a case, the static elements of operational (combat)_
_formation are used to hold back, manoeuvre, exhaust and stop_
_the opponent and the dynamic elements to strike, manoeuvre to_
_the flank and rearguard of the opponent and destroy him. The_
_combination of manoeuvre and position defence requires the com­_
_manders to adjust the defence to the given situation and combat_
_force capabilities, without obstinate perseverance in individual_
_types._


-----

to the defence or from the defence to the counter-offensive when
the ba�lefield situation requires or enables it. In both cases, such
a decision has to be in line with the intent of the higher comman­
der. The la�er has to be informed as soon as possible.

169. The commander has to be aware of these facts when planning the

operation. Therefore, when planning the operation, he must con­
sider all variants of combat and non-combat activities and be able
to organise the transition between them. In combat operations,
the following most typical forms of transition phases between
individual combat activities can be specified:[7] advance to contact;
meeting engagement; pursuit; link-up operation; withdrawal;
withdrawal fight; disengagement, regrouping of forces in contact
and others.

**Particularity of asymmetric operations**

170. Armed resistance of paramilitary groups or armed civilians who

act against regular armed forces or civilian population in the
form of terrorist actions, represents a conflict, which is asymmet­
ric in its objective, content and form of conduct. The paramilitary
group’s resistance can be an integral part or a continuation of an
intrastate conflict, for example a civil war.

7These activities can be also secondary, planned phases of one operation.


-----

171. Asymmetric operations mean an armed conflict in which an

adversary, who is not comparable in terms of objectives, methods,
means of conducting ba�le and armament, operates against
regular armed forces. Asymmetry is expressed by the fact, that
regular armed forces carry out combat activity according to
rules expressed by doctrines, while the adversary uses methods
which are contrary to the international laws of armed conflict and
commonly held ethical and moral principles. Against such an ad­
versary, the combat methods used must respond to the specifics
of the untraditional action.

_The term asymmetric operation has been frequently used in_
_particular a�er 11. September 2001 in connection with organised_
_terrorism and operations for its suppression. Asymmetry has_
_always been a part of warfare and in history we know only a few_
_examples of typical „symmetric“ operations. A majority of wars_
_began with armies which were incomparable in many aspects._
_a fight of organised resistance movement in the form of a guerilla_
_fight is the typical example of asymmetric operations. Presently,_
_with the technology development, civilization and cultural_
_differences deepening, the asymmetry is more distinct than in the_
_past. Modern armies of democratic countries are usually armed_
_and organised to beat the adversary, who defends territory (area_
_of operation). An asymmetric adversary has usually different_
_objectives and does not act upon regular armed forces only, which_
_are incomparable with his combat capabilities._

_Asymmetric operations are characterised particularly by involve­_
_ment of smaller guerrilla units, rebels and terrorists who use the_
_element of surprise. Typical for such operations are covert actions_
_aimed at creating confusion and chaos, and by terrorists, besides,_
_inflicting great losses on civilian population or acting in places_
_with high social or economic sensitivity._

172. Conducting asymmetric operations against an asymmetric adver­

sary has a number of specifics, the following facts in particular
must be taken into consideration:

   - political and military solution of the crisis must correspond to

the clearly formulated operation’s end-state;

-----

   - legitimacy of the operations must be clear to all and generally

accepted;

   - military force must be used adequately and selectively;

   - in these operations, the importance of the armed forces political

control increases;

   - civilian and military intelligence must produce united integra­

ted flow;

   - greater respect should be taken in reference to the interests and

needs of the civilian population;

   - the operation’s success is conditioned by the isolation of the

armed resistance (terrorist groups) from their surroundings;

   - protection of the neutral and sympathetic part of the population

and own bases of operation is also a part of an operation;

   - elimination of the resistance forces (terrorists) intelligence net is

one of the fundamental conditions of a successful operation;

   - the condition for the ultimate solution is only the physical or

political elimination of the armed resistance.

173. The core tasks in operations against the asymetric opponent are:

finding the enemy; fixing the resistance fighters (terrorists) and
striking the enemy; intelligence gathering, observing; monitoring
and investigating; mediation; supervision; patrolling; convoy
protection; searching; protective and defensive operations of
one’s own troops and civilian population; offensive operations
(raids).

174. In elaborating conduct of combat activities principles, its arma­

ment and training, the AFCR should prepare for participation in
asymmetric operations. Commanders and staffs are expected to
be able to respond to the adversary who is unlegible and unpre­
dictable.

#### CHAPTER 6

 NON-COMBAT OPERATIONS


-----

#### NON-COMBAT OPERATIONS

175. Non-combat operations are military operations conducted by

armed forces who plan to achieve their operational objectives by
military means other than the use of force. NATO Crisis response
operations (CRO) outside Article 5 of the North-Atlantic Treaty
are also considered to be non-combat operations. Weapons can be
used for self-defence or in some specific phases of an operation
as a means of last resort. Non-combat operations are divided into
peace support operations[8] and supporting operations.

176. Peace support operations are operations in which the diplo­

matic, civilian and military means are impartially used, usually
according to rules and principles of the UN Charter, with the
purpose of preserving or restoring peace in a crisis area. They
may include measures for conflict prevention, peacemaking, pea­
ce enforcement, peacekeeping, peacebuilding and humanitarian
operations.

177. These operations are usually carried out on the basis of the UN

Security Council decision or on the basis of a consultation’s
mechanism agreed on between NATO and EU. They are carried
out with the approval of the states, on whose territory they are
conducted, on the basis of the UN Security Council or other
international authorities a�er concluding a peace agreement
between states involved in the crisis situation. The mission of
peace support operations is to create a safe environment in which
civilian organizations can restore the infrastructure required for
permanent peace.

8Nowadays the term „stabilization operation“ is introduced for this type of
operation. In view of the content, it is a synonym.


-----

_Peace support operations are not the same as operations other than_
_war, they constitute a part of them. There are several categories_
_of operations other than war: disaster relief, support in anti-drug_
_or anti-terrorist campaigns, military consulting or support to_
_friendly governments. Armed forces deployments usually occur_
_in peace time as well, but are not necessarily to support peace,_
_but result from local conflicts or intrastate conflicts, interstate or_
_multinational conflicts, and without formal declaration of war._


178. Supporting operations are operations, within which assistance

is provided (usually humanitarian) to the population, civilian
authorities and organizations as a response to the extensive non­
-military threat to the civilian population or environment. They
are the response to the situations caused by disasters, possibly
by other causes, when human lives, property and cultural values
are threatened, and when the force and means of responsible
authorities can’t cope with them. In this context, they apply also
as search and rescue operations.

179. The AFCR may be involved in non-combat operations within

a multinational formation abroad or it can be used for the ope­
rations directed by the CR’s government on the territory of the
CR. It concerns mostly assistance operations to support the CR’s
police or operations within the integrated rescue system of the
Czech Republic. In sporadic cases, it may concern the operations
of the CR abroad directed by the CR’s government. Principles of
these operations are independently described in chapter 7 of this
doctrine.

180. During all types of non-combat operations it is necessary to bear

in mind their humanitarian character. Their mutual and at the
same time the primary objective is to first create the conditions
for tension termination and normalization of life of the populati­
on in the area endangered by a conflict or a natural disaster and
help the local populace. Should the operations be connected with
the limited use of weapons, they should not endanger the lives of
the population. Achieving appointed objectives through the long­
-lasting use of force isn’t necessarily the best, and for the future,
the most sure solution.


-----

**Principles of operations other than war**

181. In Chapter 4 there is a list of principles, which relate to all types

of military operations. AJP-01 (B) states in article 2207, specific
principles for CRO, from which the following are important for
the AFCR:

   - **Endurance. Achieving operational objectives depends in par­**

ticular on the military component of the operation and o�en
requires long and patient persuasion. It is always necessary to
bear in mind the final objective and long-term social,economic
and political coherences.

   - **Unity of effort. In the course of operations, it is necessary to**

seek the unity of action of all military and civilian components.
Commanders at all levels must be aware that military units
are the most organized elements in the operation, therefore
they should take concrete steps to coordinate the activity with
numerous international and non-governmental organizations
operating in the operation area.

   - **Credibility. The AFCR members must be reliable and exude**

credibility not only with multinational formations and their
representatives, but particularly towards civilian population
and international and non-governmental organizations. That
requires a high degree of professionalism, organization and
accuracy when executing tasks.

   - **Transparency. Operational objectives and methods for their**

achievement must be proclaimed publicly all the time, using all
means. Constant awareness of the public, conflict parties, local
authorities, international and non-governmental organizations
is the precondition for ensuring credibility and achievement of
the operational objective itself.

   - **Security and protection. Demand for force and civilian popu­**

lation protection is extraordinarily important in non-combat
operations. It is achieved by strict observance of force prote­
ction common principles by every single AFCR member, ROE
rules and the ability to respond flexibly to the new situation.

   - **Flexibility. Commanders at all levels must be able to decide**

flexibly according to operational environment development
so, to ensure achieving the operations final objective. It is ens­


-----

ured not only by the communication and information system
capabilities, but also by appropriate authority delegation, the
unit’s combat capabilities and relative logistic independence.

- **Impartiality. The AFCR s members participating in non­**

-combat operations, particularly peace support operations,
must constantly proclaim their neutrality and impartiality to
all conflict parties involved. It is done by the transparency and
credibility of behavior. It requires a high degree of professiona­
lism and high moral and mental endurance.

_Without impartiality, there are no prospects of preserving_
_the confidence and cooperation of the conflicting parties. For_
_peacekeeping forces it is not enough to act impartially, they must_
_be seen to be acting impartially by the parties involved. During_
_most peacekeeping operations, this impartiality will constantly_
_be questioned and threatened. The more complex a situation, the_
_more difficult it is for the peacekeeper to remain impartial and to_
_retain the confidence of all parties involved. The suggestion of_
_loss of impartiality or the actual loss of impartiality may have_
_serious consequences. In the most favorable case, it may cause_
_the reduction of confidence, in the worst case it may lead to the_
_escalation into a peace-enforcement scenario. This may lead to_
_the widespread and unlimited application of force and heavy_
_civilian and military losses as well as to the failure of the mission_
_itself. It is not always possible to remain impartial during peace­_
_-enforcement operations; it is not the central principle which will_
_lead to success, neither is it the consent of all parties. However,_
_the transition to the state of peace will be easier to achieve if the_
_peacekeeping force tries to create the necessary preconditions_
_in an impartial way and if the force takes measures to promote_
_consent._

- **Application of force. a soldier‘s potential for applying force is**

one of the decisive aspects for achieving operational objectives.
The AFCR’s members must act firmly and proclaim their de­
termination to accomplish their mission in all circumstances,
but every possible application of force must be in accord with
ROE.


_Without impartiality, there are no prospects of preserving_
_the confidence and cooperation of the conflicting parties. For_
_peacekeeping forces it is not enough to act impartially, they must_
_be seen to be acting impartially by the parties involved. During_
_most peacekeeping operations, this impartiality will constantly_
_be questioned and threatened. The more complex a situation, the_
_more difficult it is for the peacekeeper to remain impartial and to_
_retain the confidence of all parties involved. The suggestion of_
_loss of impartiality or the actual loss of impartiality may have_
_serious consequences. In the most favorable case, it may cause_
_the reduction of confidence, in the worst case it may lead to the_
_escalation into a peace-enforcement scenario. This may lead to_
_the widespread and unlimited application of force and heavy_

_itself. It is not always possible to remain impartial during peace­_
_-enforcement operations; it is not the central principle which will_

_the transition to the state of peace will be easier to achieve if the_
_peacekeeping force tries to create the necessary preconditions_
_in an impartial way and if the force takes measures to promote_
_consent._


-----

   - **Mutual respect. Troops operating in the operations area must**

behave in accordance with international law and ROE and at
the same time respect local cultural, religious and ethnic pe­
culiarities, and rules and laws of the host country. The AFCR’s
members must show a high degree of discipline and behave
in the way to gain the respect of the conflicting parties, local
population and local authority.

   - **Consent. The success of peace support operations depends**

on the consent of the parties involved. This doesn’t apply in
peace enforcement operations. The difference between peace
keeping operations and peace enforcement operations is not in
the level of force, but in the existence of a certain consent level
of conflicting parties, to carry out the peace task.

   - **Freedom of movement. a sufficient degree of freedom of**

movement is essential for peace support operations. Armed
forces which cannot move within the theatre of operations are
unable to successfully complete their mission. The fundamen­
tal right of free movement has to be protected and if necessary
enforced.

   - **Minimum necessary force. The success of peace support**

operations depends on the consent of the parties involved. In
order to preserve this consent, it is essential to use only the
lowest level of (necessary) force. This requirement limits place,
time and the size of deployed troops. Partial tactical success,
could in the end result, lead to the operation failure. The
principle „minimum necessary force“ can not be interpreted as
no application of force. If the situation demands, a commander
will have to make the decision to apply force.

**Peace support operations**

182. In peace support operations, diplomatic measures are decisive

for achieving the objective political solution, and they usually
precede military operations. The diplomatic process is divided
into preventive diplomacy (the conflict is not yet ongoing) and
the process of peace making (the conflict broke out and is on­
going). This process can be supported by the following military
operations.


-----

183. Conflict prevention operations are peace support operations

using mutually complementing diplomatic, civilian and if neces­
sary military means for monitoring and detecting conflict reasons
and for taking timely measures to prevent the outbreak, escala­
tion or renewal of the hostility. The goal of a military operation
is to contribute to a political conflict se�lement and to prevent
the outbreak of the armed conflict. Military activities may have
various aims in accordance with political requirements:

   - warning of the potential conflict parties;

   - surveillance of the security situation development;

  - ensure training and security system reform of the country of

potential conflict;

   - preventive deployment in an area of potential conflict.

184. Peace making operations are peace support operations, carried

out a�er the conflict‘s outbreak, aimed at achieving an armistice
or peace se�lement. The diplomatic activities are used initially
and they can be supported, if necessary, by direct or indirect use
of military means. They may include participation of respected
organizations, reconciliation interposition, diplomatic pressure,
isolation, sanctions, embargo or other activities, approved by
leading international political organizations.

_Peace making is done primarily by diplomatic means. Military_
_assistance in peace making operations is possible too, both indi­_
_rect (staff support or planning), or direct use of military means._

_Sanctions and embargo imposed by the UN Security Council can_
_help to prevent conflict, but they may be used in other conflict_
_phases in case conflict prevention fails. Military forces, with_
_respect to its organization and combat potential, can enforce and_
_oversee sanctions and embargo adherence. It is done by observa­_
_tion and guarding by all means, both from the ground and the air,_
_and using the naval and river means as well._

185. Peace keeping operations are operations which follow the

agreement conclusion or cease fire, which creates a favorable
environment with high concordance and understanding and

-----

low probability of disrupting this state. The use of force by peace
support units is usually limited to defending their own troops.

_Peace keeping operations are usually executed in accordance with_
_the principles of Chapter VI of the UN Charter for monitoring_
_and facilitation of peace accord implementation. Loss of consent_
_and the failure to meet obligations by one of the parties may limit_
_the freedom of action of peace support forces and endanger the_
_continuation of the mission. The requirement to maintain impar­_
_tiality limits the force application of peace forces. Maintaining_
_and enforcing consent is the major purpose of peace keeping._

186. Peace enforcement operations are peace support operations

conducted to achieve a cease fire or peace agreement in cases
where the extent of concord and understanding between the
parties involved is unreliable and the threat of nonobservance
is significant. Peacekeepers must be able to use appropriate
coercive force and means and urge impartially the cease fire or
peace accord se�lement.


_Peace enforcement operations are usually conducted in accordan­_
_ce with principles of chapter VII of the UN Charter. They have_
_a coercive character with the aim to ensure observance of peace_
_accords and are conducted, if the parties involved couldn’t reach_
_an agreement or the agreement could be unreliable. They are_
_intended for the maintenance or restoration of peace, or to enforce_
_conditions laid down in the mandate._

_During execution of the operations, there must be a very close_
_connection (association) between military and political objecti­_
_ves. It is very important to realize, that defeating or destroying_
_the adversary is not the objective of peace enforcement operations,_
_but to make, force and convince the parties to adjust to a parti­_
_cular course of activity. The constitution of military force with_
_adequate coercive combat capabilities is very important for every_
_decision to deploy Alliance forces in peace support operations._


-----

187. Post conflict peace-building operations are peace support ope­

rations following conflict resolution, to ensure long-term support
to the population and to create a peaceful environment in the
society. The operation uses mutually complementing diplomatic,
civilian and if necessary, military means. Peace support operati­
ons require demanding and long-term effort and may be carried
out concurrently with other types of peace support operations.

_Peace building includes political, economic, social and military_
_measures aimed at enforcing a political solution to the conflict._
_It concerns the mechanisms for recognition and support of struc­_
_tures for peace stabilisation, credibility consolidation, prosperity_
_and economic reconstruction. O�en, when the conflict is over, the_
_international community’s a�ention shi�s somewhere else, and_
_the peace building phase doesn’t receive enough resources and the_
_operation is stalemated. Peace building requires the obligation of_
_humanitarian and originative resources to the long-term political_
_process._

188. Humanitarian operations are peace support operations specially

focused on easing the human suffering in places where the local
responsible civilian authorities are not able or do not want to
support the population in a corresponding manner. They can
precede, be conducted concurrently or supplement the activities
of specialised civilian humanitarian organizations.

_measures aimed at enforcing a political solution to the conflict._

_tures for peace stabilisation, credibility consolidation, prosperity_

_the peace building phase doesn’t receive enough resources and the_
_operation is stalemated. Peace building requires the obligation of_
_humanitarian and originative resources to the long-term political_
_process._


-----

_Humanitarian operations may be organized with the participa­_
_tion of military forces independently or within peace support_
_operations. They will usually be organized within the UN or_
_NATO crisis management system. In some cases, the military as­_
_sistance of the AFCR’s forces may be provided based on a bilateral_
_agreement between the CR’s government and government of the_
_country seeking assistance._


189. Retaining consent. Military representatives of peace support

forces must ensure, at all levels, the mutual awareness of the
level of consent reached between conflicting parties or between
conflicting parties and the peace support forces.

_For instance, it the operational commander has made an agree­_
_ment with the leader of a faction about a particular course of_
_action, he should then do everything he can to ensure that the_
_agreement is transmi�ed down to those faction members facing_
_his tactical commanders in the field. Similarly, one of the most_
_useful peacekeeping commodities that a tactical commander can_
_pass on to his superiors are the fruits of agreements made with_
_local faction leaders. There are various ways in which consent_
_may be lost. These include taking sides, using excessive force,_
_using illegal methods or acting outside the mandate, unconvin­_
_cing actions, insufficient respect for the local parties and a lack of_
_understanding for each other._

190. Application of force. The inappropriate application of force risks

disturbing the balance of a peacekeeping operation. This may
result in an uncontrolled and violent transition to a peace–en­
forcement operation. The decisions concerning the use of force
are the most difficult that a commander will make. There are
many alternatives to the application of force: deterrence, threats,
negotiations and interposition, controlling measures, rewards
and punishments, protection, warning and the use of police force.
a final option is withdrawal of troops. CIMIC operations, in sup­
port of the rebuilding may be used to reward parties involved.
Other alternatives are psychological operations and the threat of
publicity.


_For instance, it the operational commander has made an agree­_
_ment with the leader of a faction about a particular course of_
_action, he should then do everything he can to ensure that the_
_agreement is transmi�ed down to those faction members facing_
_his tactical commanders in the field. Similarly, one of the most_
_useful peacekeeping commodities that a tactical commander can_
_pass on to his superiors are the fruits of agreements made with_
_local faction leaders. There are various ways in which consent_
_may be lost. These include taking sides, using excessive force,_
_using illegal methods or acting outside the mandate, unconvin­_
_cing actions, insufficient respect for the local parties and a lack of_
_understanding for each other._


-----

191. Observation. Observers play an important role in stabilising

the ba�lefield and in se�ing up confidence-building measures.
Soldiers and civilians sent out as observers or monitors will
be unarmed and will rely largely on their impartial status for
protection. Soldiers can be deployed individually or in small
multinational groups to monitor, verify and report. The objective
of these missions is to obtain timely and accurate information.
Specific tasks may include early warning to prevent a conflict
from arising or escalating and observing the withdrawal of
troops from a certain area. Observers should not be deployed for
activities which could violate agreements or international law.
This could endanger their status.

192. Interposition is positioning of peace forces between two parties

a�er a conflict has ended. The objective of interposition is to
achieve a stable situation, in order to create the conditions for
a lasting peace. a force deployed between parties must have the
ability to discourage the application of force and to encourage
talks. The troops have to be armed for tasks, which anticipate the
use of force. Peace support troops may be supported in these situ­
ations by stand-by reinforcements, indirect fire and air support.

193. Stabilising measures contribute to the lowering of tension in the

area. There are different forms of stabilizing measures:

  - building communication mechanisms between all parties;

   - the establishment of demilitarised buffer zones;

  - zonal restrictions on the deployment of weapons and

manpower;

  - mutual and balanced reductions in personnel and equipment;

   - advanced reporting of military activities and exercises;

   - joint inspections of disputed areas and facilities;

  - the exchange of liaison teams.

194. Demobilisation comprises the activities of a peace force to resto­

re and maintain a reasonable degree of peace and security in the
area of operations. Demobilisation comprises five stages:

  - negotiating and signing a fi�ing peace agreement;


-----

  - establishing and managing a cease fire;

  - withdrawing and assembling belligerents;

  - disarming belligerents;

  - dispersing of armed units and, if possible, repatriation of

warring factions members (captives).

195. Military assistance refers to all forms of assistance by peace for­

ces to a civilian or military authority of the state administration
or local home rule based on a mandate. If there is no civilian
authority, it may provide direct help given to civilian communi­
ties. It covers a wide variety of possible tasks and may precede
or follow a successfully conducted demobilisation operation.
In rendering military assistance, the peace force supports the
civilian government according to the terms of a peace agreement
or mandate.

**Supporting operations**

196. Supporting operations are non-combat operations within which

humanitarian assistance is provided to the population, civilian
authorities and organizations responding to the extensive non­
-military danger, and in cases when forces and means of the
responsible authorities do not suffice for the solution.

197. Supporting operations are organised similarly to humanitarian

operations, with the participation of military forces independent­
ly or within peace support operations. They will usually be or­
ganized within the UN, NATO or EU crisis management system.
In some cases, the military assistance of the AFCR’s forces may
be provided based on a bilateral agreement between the CR’s
government and government of the country seeking assistance.


-----

_In most situations where humanitarian help is provided, it is_
_likely that a wide range of civilian organisations will be involved,_
_including governmental and non-governmental organisations_
_and private volunteer organizations. Since the general responsi­_
_bility for providing humanitarian assistance lies with these orga­_
_nisations, the commander providing military assistance must be_
_maintaining the closest cooperation. Great a�ention must be paid_
_to the credit and actual activities of these organisations (some of_
_them may be involved in illegal activities), not to damage the_
_legal basis of the contingent._


198. Military assistance during supporting and rescue operations is

usually provided in the following categories:

  - health protection and life-saving of civilian population

groups or individuals (during natural disasters or ecological
accidents);

   - protection of the delivery of goods and of relief workers (aga­

inst warring factions or criminal elements);

  - administrative tasks, including the coordination of relief

organisations and distribution of supplies;

   - support to the civilian humanitarian organisations (transport,

food and water distribution, medical assistance, engineer
support in construction and maintenance of roads, bridges
and other infrastructure).

199. Close cooperation with civilian authorities should also ensure

that military assistance will be provided only as necessary for
urgent operations. This will ensure the local population will not
be dependent on this help and the operation will not last dispro­
portionally long.

200. Search and rescue operations are organised using the force and

means of the air force, ground forces, navy, specialised rescue
teams and relevant means. In the times of peace, search and
rescue represent procedures, measures and means, which remain
the national responsibility. In times of conflict or for specific ope­
rations, existing search and rescue organizations can be used.


-----

201. Non-Combatant Evacuation Operation (NEO) are operations

conducted in times of armed conflict in order to move non­
-combatants (civilian population not involved in the combat
action) endangered in the combat area to a safer environment.
Non-combatants are the civilian personnel of armed forces,
who in the sense of international humanitarian law do not have
combatant status of a fighter, (member of organized and marked
armed forces), and not a fighting civilian person, who meet the
conditions of international humanitarian law for civilian person­
nel protection during war).

NEO is a diplomatic initiative with participation of military forces

in a supporting role. a military formation conducting an NEO
should be able to provide security, reception and control, trans­
port and necessary medical assistance to civilian population and
unarmed military personnel who are to be evacuated.

202. Evacuation operations are operations usually conducted under

the aegis of the UN, in which military force give cover or help
to evacuate endangered civilian population from the crisis area.
Forces assigned to execute an evacuation operation should have
capabilities similar to those of the forces supporting NEO opera­
tions. An evacuation operation can be carried out in an uncertain
or unfriendly environment.

203. Military assistance to civilian authorities is an operation that

includes military activities that are usually provided by civilian
organizations, but the emergency situation doesn’t allow this.
Form and extent may be similar to peace support operations.

 OPERATIONS ON THE CR’S
 TERRITORY


-----

#### OPERATIONS ON THE CR’S
 TERRITORY

**Air space defence of the CR**

204. The air space defence of the CR in peace time, during a crisis

or war is one of the most important tasks of the CR’s air force.
Since 1999, this task is carried out within the NATO integrated
extended air defence system (NATINEADS).

205. Air space defence of the CR is an application of NATO counter­

-air defence operations in conditions of the CR and therefore the
AFCR follow the same principles. It has an exclusively defensive
character and aims at fighting off an a�ack of the CR’s territory by
an opponent’s air means. This task has also a preventive function,
for it demonstrates determination of the CR to adamantly act aga­
inst the emergence or possibly escalation of an armed conflict.

206. Forces and means of the AFCR’s air force, detached to NATINEADS,

primarily execute tasks over the CR’s territory, and based on NATO
military commi�ee directions MC 54/1, can carry out tasks over
neighboring countries’ territory within flying range.

207. Air space defence of the CR:

   - during peace time, carry out tasks of armed surveillance above

the CR s territory (Air Policing), provide navigational assistan­
ce and help in emergency landing situations and in addition
ensure the defence against non-military air threats (so called
RENEGADE concept);

  - during crisis or war, defend the CR s air space with the obje­

ctive to prohibit the execution of air strikes on important and
defended objects, one s own and allied troops, and prevent
enemy air reconnaissance and overflight of the CR s territory
to the territory of allied states.


-----

208. If necessary, a supplemental national air defence system is esta­

blished to reinforce the NATINEADS system. It is subordinated
to the Joint Operational Centre, MoD. Its use is however directed
through NATO authorities in order to avoid conflicts with NATO
air force commander orders and not to endanger friendly or
allied air means. National authorities also ensure replacement of
losses and all-round support of air forces earmarked for NATO.

**Guarding of facilities vital for state defence**

209. Objects important for state defence (herea�er only OISD) are

objects, which by their destruction or damage, endangering of
workers, or stealing, breaking or damaging the property which is
temporarily or permanently stored there, the CR’s security or abi­
lity to act could be considerably endangered. OISD are divided
into two basic groups depending on the guard support required
from the CR’s armed forces elements.

   - The first group comprises landed estates and facilities located

within military domains and their fixtures, which are of great
significance for ensuring the state defence in political, military
or economic terms and buildings and landed estates, where the
property rights or other rights are exercised by the Ministry
of defence or by a legal entity established or founded by the
MOD (herea�er only military objects).

  - The second group comprises government designated landed

estates, buildings and other objects which can have strategic
importance to the country in a state of peril or in the state of
war, including specified segments of state boundaries and
buildings and landed estates designated for population protection
(hereafter only non-military objects).

210. Guarding of military objects will be within military operations on

the CR’s territory conducted by the CR’s armed forces members.
Primary emphasis is on military objects used for storing wea­
pons, ammunition, their misusable components and restricted
items. These military objects are guarded as part of the standard
activity of the military formations and organizations using or
administering these objects.


-----

211. In the threat of a crisis or in the crisis situation associated with

the threat to the external or internal CR’s security, the intensity
of standard provided guarding will increase and the amount of
guarded military objects will extend. Guarding of such an extent
will exceed the capabilities of relevant military formations and
organizations (in question) and will be provided by military
police and detached or created military units.

212. Non-military objects will be secured and guarded by the CR’s

armed forces only on the basis of government’s decision and
usually in the threat of a crisis or in the crisis situation associated
with the threat to the external or internal CR’s security. The em­
phasis will be laid on guarding such objects, where the devasta­
ting potential is accumulated in such an amount that its possible
release endangers the lives and health of a significant population
(nuclear power plants, reservoirs, chemical plants etc.).

213. Guarding of these non-military objects will be ensured by

purpose-built formations of the CR’s armed forces. During the
proclamation of a state of emergency, the AFCR’s active reserves
will be used for guarding. A�er the proclamation of the state of
emergency or state of war, primarily the units mobilized by the
regional command will be used for guarding.

**Assistance operations**

214. Assistance operations to support the Police of the CR (PCR)

are carried out when providing state boundary protection or
executing tasks of public order police or protective service for
lack of PCR force and means. The use of the CR’s armed forces
in this kind of assistance operations comes from the demands of
responsible central and regional crisis management authorities.
To meet these demands, the CR’s armed forces create purpose­
-built task forces.

215. Composition, size and equipment of the purpose-built task

force will always be adjusted to the character, extent and time
of the task’s execution. According to OPCON principles, the
purpose-built task force is assigned by the AFCR’s operational
commander, on the basis of the CR’s Home Office request, to car­


-----

ry out tasks in particular regions. For the duration of a regional
task execution, the purpose-built task force is subordinated to the
purpose-built task force commander or the detached forces and
means commander and is deployed upon demand of the PCR
regional commander.

216. Forces and means of other components of the CR’s armed forces

on the territory can be used for the PCR tasks, if they are not in­
volved in preparing for or executing its major tasks. Use of these
forces and means will always be short-term.


-----

**Operations within an integrated rescue system**

**of the CR (IRS).**

217. The IRS of the CR is composed of basic and other components.

The IRS‘s basic components are the CR‘s fire rescue corps (he­
rea�er only FRC CR), fire service units, assigned to the regional
blanket coverage, medical rescue service and Police of the CR.
Some detached forces and means of the CR’s armed forces are
also IRS components, particularly forces and means of military
rescue units.

218. Assistance operations to support the IRS are carried out by the

CR’s armed forces in the following cases:

   - rescue operations in cases of disasters or other serious situa­

tions, endangering lives, health, considerable property values
or environment, if the administrative authorities, territorial
autonomy authorities and basic IRS components can’t ensure
rescue operations within their power;

  - to remove other impending threats using military equip­

ment, if the administrative authorities, territorial autonomy
authorities, legal entities and IRS don’t possess the required
equipment;

   - air monitoring of disaster or radiation and chemical situation

in a given territory;

  - providing transport of humanitarian and medical help;

  - to provide air medical evacuation, when there is a danger of

delay and the forces and means of the air rescue service are not
sufficient;

   - to provide air search and rescue service.

219. The use of the CR’s armed forces in these kinds of assistance ope­

rations comes from the position and assignment within the IRS
alarm plans or requirements of responsible central and regional
crisis management authorities. To meet these demands, the CR’s
armed forces create purpose-built task forces.


-----

220. The core of the purpose-built task forces is composed of the mem­

bers and equipment from rescue, engineer, chemical, rotary wing,
logistics and medical formations and organizations. Operational
manpower increases during peace time may occur based on
the government’s decision to assign personnel and useable
equipment with crews from combat units (mechanized, artillery,
anti-aircra�, reconnaissance etc.), or military organizations or
schools.

221. The purpose-built task force is assigned within OPCON to the

Deputy Chief of General Staff – by the JOC MO director on the
basis of the Home Office to carry out tasks in particular regions.
During task execution on the region’s territory, the task force is
subordinated to the commander of that regional command.

222. In a state of emergency, active reserves may be used for task

execution to support the IRS, particularly in rescue and engineer
formations or regional command infantry companies.

223. A�er the proclamation of a state of emergency or state of war,

exclusively the CR’s rescue formations can be used for task
execution to support the IRS.

224. Forces and means of other CR’s armed forces elements will be

used on the territory in a similar way and extent as assistance
operations for the Police of the CR.

#### AFCR’S NATIONAL TASKS IN
 PREPARATION AND CONDUCT OF
 OPERATIONS

**Preparation of the armed forces**

225. Armed forces preparation consists of many measures aimed at

achieving their required capabilities. It has three basic, usually
not separable elements: training, cultivation and education.

226. The capabilities of the CR’s armed forces express their quality

and applicability. The build-up and preparation of the CR’s
armed forces is systematically regulated to achieve the CR’s
political-military ambitions and is directed to ensure the planned
and gradual achievement of desired operational capabilities of
the CR’s armed forces.

227. Operational capabilities represent all that specific AFCR com­

ponents and the CR armed forces as a whole should know and
be able to implement during deployment preparation and actual
operation. Constituent (individual) operational capabilities
complement, are interconnected and interdependent. Necessary
operational capabilities to achieve NATO force missions and tasks
are expressed by key operational capabilities: timely force acces­
sibility, effective intelligence service, deployability and mobility,
deployment effectiveness, efficient command, communication
and control system (C3) and logistic sustainability, endurance
and force protection.

228. The AFCR’s forces must be armed, equipped, trained and suppor­

ted appropriately to achieve the required operational capabilities.
These are achieved particularly by:


-----

  - NATO Ministerial Guidance requirements and Force Goals

execution when building up the AFCR;

  - implementation of adopted NATO standardization agreements

in the AFCR’s technology development field and operational
standardization field;

  - incorporation of doctrine and other NATO operational stan­

dards into the AFCR’s doctrinal system and their adoption by
commanders and staff members at all AFCR command and
control levels;

  - achieving the highest level of professional preparedness of

all members and unified action of all AFCR organic units in
conditions closely approximating true military operations.

229. Preparation of commanders, staffs and troops is a constant

process of sustaining and improving troop, staff and force
abilities and skills, leading to an improved ability to take part in
preparation and conduct of military operations. Various forms
(ways) of education are part of the preparation, (as broadening
knowledge by formal and informal learning), individual training,
unit training and various forms of assigned unit exercises at all
AFCR command and control levels. Commander and staff pea­
cetime preparation must ensure mastery of common principles
of conducting combat and non-combat activities including their
support and adoption of standard and non-standard procedures
in solving various situations during preparation and conduct
of all possible kinds of the AFCR’s operations. The educational
aspect of this process lies in shaping desired personality traits
of the AFCR members such as tenacity, honesty, accuracy, strong
will, courage, self-discipline and others.

230. Individual training is the basic method of achieving required

combat capabilities of troops, units and other AFCR organic
formations. Its content must respect the principles and requi­
rements of doctrines and regulations of the AFCR’s doctrinal
system, which define the fundamental ways of task execution by
the AFCR’s elements in military operational deployments.

231. Individual training is a method of educating and prepa­

ring the individual, focused on acquiring the knowledge


-----

and skills critical for executing military operational tasks.
For commanders and instructors, it is acquiring the knowledge
and skills necessary to execute their command functions in the
process of subordinate training. Individual training (preparation)
is organized:

   - during basic, professional and special training;

  - at the Defence university and Military academy (MOD depart­

mental school);

  - during training in units in the form of improvement training

and self-study (individual preparation);

  - in military schools and courses abroad.

232. Collective training harmonizes and improves the knowledge

and skills of an individual, gained in individual training, through
subsequent (follow-up) collectively executed activities in organic
formations of all types and at all the CR’s armed forces organiza­
tional levels. Collective training culminates in an exercise aimed
at replicating an actual operational practice to achieve the highest
level of combat capability in AFCR individual organic formations
(forces and means) with a given level of armament and other
equipment and support. Basic kinds of exercises include:

   - field exercise with troops;

  - command-post exercise;

   - virtual exercise.

It is possible and functionally appropriate to combine them.
Exercises can be conducted on maps, in the field or with compu­
ters and information technologies.

233. Exercises can be divided according to various criteria:

   - according to service and troops: land forces exercise; air force

exercise; special forces exercise; special-tactical exercise; multi­
services joint exercise;

  - according to a participant’s nationality: AFCR’s national

exercise; multinational exercise; international exercise on
a bilateral level;

  - according to a command level: tactical exercises, operational


-----

and strategic exercises which handle tasks of security, state
sovereignty and territorial integrity of the CR or NATO
countries.

234. Exercise content emphasizes master planning and directing

subordinate activities during operations to practice and verify
the commander’s readiness and staff harmonization. The exercise
primarily consists of executing combat tasks and directing opera­
tions in situations and conditions closely replicating combat.

235. Training requirements and goals:

  - training must be considered one of the fundamental means to

achieve required unit/soldier operational capabilities;

  - the training must prepare individuals/units to conduct combat

operations;

  - the training must include other elements participating in the

CR’s security system as well;

  - the training must focus on accomplishing the most difficult

tasks in the most difficult conditions, thereby preparing
individuals and units to carry out simpler, but still important,
specific tasks;

  - apart from the training component, the training must also

include testing, analyses and generalization;

   - during the training, particularly exercises, the AFCR operatio­

nal capability levels must be publicly demonstrated;

  - the training must be systematic, proceed from simple to more

complicated, from common to concrete and always maximal
complex and in an environment which maximally corresponds
to a real situation;

   - the training is usually directed by a commander or an official

who will also in reality be directing combat (operation);

  - the training in all forms and phases must evoke patriotism,

respect for democracy and human values and mutual combat
friendship.

236. Pre-deployment training is organized with respect to projected

deployment tasks using knowledge gained from previous missi­
on evaluations.


-----

237. During deployment (operation), training is organized with the

objective to adapt to specific operational conditions, master new
operational methods, familiarize newcomers with tasks, rotation
or replacement and their adaptation to the weaponry and equip­
ment. In joint multinational operations, the training is carried out
according to the multinational force commander’s instructions.

238. Training of active reserves is part of the AFCR members‘ training.

During AFCR force deployments a�er mobilization, improve­
ment training for mobilized personnel is planned and carried out
to renew their military competencies.

**Build-up of wartime armed forces of the CR and their**

**mobilization**

239. In the process of building-up wartime armed forces of the CR

and their mobilization, there will be, in particular states within
mobilization system preparations, mutually continuing activities,
which will respond to the level and type of threat to the CR. Their
content and form depend on the level of concern: state of peace,
state of tension, state of peril to the country, state of war or de­


**Build-up of wartime armed forces of the CR and their**


-----

mobilization. The CR’s armed forces transition from peace to war
structure is triggered by the timely indication of a conflict’s start.

240. In a state of peace, operational support is organized using stan­

dard procedures. Mobilization preparations primarily focus on
elaboration of mobilization projects, which will be the basic docu­
ments for the CR’s armed forces wartime build-up. Concurrently,
assessments will be carried out on the requirements and resources
of the state in the replacement flow/personnel augmentation and
supply fields. Mobilization project revision will be done in accor­
dance with the AFCR’s changing requirements and development
of the international political-military situation.

241. A�er identifying a threat to the CR’s security, mobilization

projects will be worked up into plans of professional a unit’s
build-up or mobilization plans and preparatory measures for
their execution will be taken. The modernization projects will
be quickly completed and new ones initiated, particularly to
procure lacking armaments and combat and special equipment.
Necessary reserve supplies build-up will start. To meet these me­
asures, specifications will be made to the MOD’s medium-term
activity and development plan and MOD’s budget.

242. A�er a state of tension[9] is declared, the Mod will commence

executing preliminary measures. Their part will be executing
professional unit build-up plans according to wartime organiza­
tional structure and their combat and professional unit cohesion
development requirements. The MoD’s budget and its possible
increase will be adjusted as necessary. Augmentation will be
done by recruiting new military professionals and taking active
reserves into active duty. Realization of economic measures for
states of crisis will commence. Personnel liable to conscription
will be administratively screened and registered for possible
future induction. Necessary personnel records are established
to ensure state defence. Mobilized civilian resources will be
provided (supplied) as needed.

9The term „state of tension“ is borrowed from new and to date not an
authorised legal amendment. It provides a functional foundation for the
systematic build-up and mobilization of the AFCR forces included in this
doctrine.


-----

243. A�er a state of peril to the country declaration, troops on active

service will be transferred into extraordinary (activated) service.
Unit mobilization build-up plans commence by calling up
reserves into service and executing unit combat (professional)
cohesion development. Realization of economic measures for sta­
tes of crisis, material distribution from special–purpose reserves
and replenishment of mobilized civilian resources will continue.
Dra�ing according to the CR’s armed forces needs will continue.

244. A�er a state of war declaration, partial or general mobilization

will be carried out. The dra� and training of reserves will continue,
called-up reserves will be assigned to replace losses of deployed
units or build-up new units. Realization of economic measures
for states of crisis, material distribution from special–purpose
reserves and replenishment of mobilized civilian resources will
continue.

245. Demobilization will be ordered by the president of the CR

a�er the end of conflict. The process of the CR‘s armed forces
formation termination from its wartime organizational structure
will commence and troops on extraordinary service will be trans­
ferred either on active service or as active or compulsory reserves.
Mobilized civilian resources will be returned to their owners,
realization of economic measures for states of crisis and material
distribution from special–purpose reserves will be terminated.


-----

**Strategic movements**

246. As a consequence of the CR membership in NATO and the level of

tasks executed by the AFCR, the problem of troop transport and
movements for the whole spectrum of possible NATO operations
has emerged, both according to Article 5 of the North-Atlantic
Treaty or outside the Article. These general operating principles
governing strategic movements in support of NATO operations
can be deduced for all operations. In addition to currently accep­
ted common principles, the following principles also apply:

   - **Collective responsibility principle – NATO authorities**

and individual countries have a collective responsibility for
ensuring transport and movement during joint operations.
Collective responsibility is divided into :

a) NATO responsibility occurs when relevant NATO operational
commanders are in charge of se�ing priorities, initiating deploy­
ments and coordination, facilitating deployment flow, supply
transport and movement of respective forces in coordination
with individual countries.

b) **An individual countries responsibility entails, when every**
dispatching country is responsible for obtaining transport means
for deployment, sustainment and redeployment of its forces. The
countries are further responsible for planning and directing their
own troop movements, even in cases when they form part of
a multinational grouping. When a country has assumed the role
of a leading country, it is further responsible for multinational
headquarters or multinational unit redeployments. To fulfill
this principle, mutual cooperation of individual countries and
activity coordination aimed at achieving the highest efficiency
is necessary. Bilateral and multilateral agreements concluded
between participating countries are used for this.

   - **Cooperation principle – cooperation between commanders**

and NATO authorities and a country’s national authorities is
necessary, both military and civilian. This cooperation can be
both bilateral and multilateral.

   - **Coordination principle – aforesaid cooperation between**

commanders and NATO authorities and a country’s national
authorities must be coordinated on the corresponding level.


-----

   - **Efficiency principle – optimizing military and civilian trans­**

portation assets by using particular transport capabilities and
advantages to the maximum extent is very necessary.

   - **Flexibility principle – the military transport system must be**

able to respond to operational situation changes and changing
requirements for movement and transport support.

   - **Standardization principle – the goal is to standardize systems,**

data formats, hardware, so�ware, equipment and procedures
ensuring their mutual compatibility, interchangeability or
functionality with the objective to maximally facilitate the
transport process.

   - **Compatibility principle – closely related to the standardization**

principle, the essence is that units are equipped appropriately
so they can communicate and cooperate on the required level.

   - **Transparency principle mutual information and data exchan­**

ge between NATO commanders and a country s military and
civilian authorities to achieve effective planning and execution
of transport tasks is necessary.

247. Relevant NATO authorities and a country’s national military and

civilian authorities are responsible for preparing and elaborating
instructions, procedures and organization of NATO forces trans­
port and movements. Individual countries are responsible for
ensuring sufficient means for deployment, supply transport and
redeployment of their own forces. However, the countries can
create means available for shared or co-operative use in case they
possess excess transport capacity. The CR will, when requested
by the relevant NATO commander, make available the transport
means which are not intended for national use and are in that
moment free.

248. Providing civilian assets to the troops is one of the basic ways of

achieving the flexibility required to fulfill the AFCR operational
requirements. Close cooperation of military transport authorities
with relevant state administration authorities is crucial. At the
NATO level, this activity is executed through allied civilian trans­
port councils and civil emergency planning (CEP) commi�ees in
ma�ers of evaluating and defining capabilities, availability and


-----

feasibility of operational objectives with civilian means. Transport
means can be obtained from national sources or from abroad.

249. The CR as a dispatching country is responsible for obtaining

transport assets, planning and controlling movements and trans­
port of national forces and national formations of multinational
forces from their home base to the destination. The national
movement coordination centre (NMCC) for movements in the CR
is designated for authorization, coordination and control of air,
naval and continental land movement and transport within the
host nation’s territory to support NATO operations, movement
and transport in accordance with the dispatching countries’
requirements and NATO commander’s operational demands.

**Operational logistical support**

250. The AFCR force logistical support abroad is arranged from CR

sources to the deployed AFCR force’s area of responsibility.
Although the use of multinational logistics may have conside­
rable advantages and lead to financial and material savings, the
AFCR may prefer national logistic support. In this case, the final
responsibility for providing logistic support, supply transport
and service support to its own troops lies with the AFCR.

251. Logistics support tasks vary according to the level of combat

activity, phase, kind and intensity of combat or operation.

   - **During the preparatory phase of the forces and means in the**

CR, these main tasks are carried out: preparation control, re­
plenishment and check of military material, resupply, logistic
systems preparation (including NSE establishment), recon­
naissance and arrangement of transport routes, transport and
movement plans elaboration, resource activation and making
contracts to support troops abroad.

   - **During the deployment phase, these main tasks are carried**

out: transport logistic support to the deployment area,
necessary material and equipment transport, billeting and
messing, developing the AFCR’s supply and service system
including territorial elements using civilian sector capabilities,
field logistic information systems activation and establishing
cooperation in the deployment area.


-----

   - **Logistic support during an operation deals with the following**

tasks: maintaining supply system efficiency, services and the
AFCR‘s repair activities, maintaining prescribed stockage le­
vels, maintenance and repair of military material, replacement
of damaged weaponry and equipment, personnel rotation
support, soldier’s rest and free time support, support of huma­
nitarian relief.

   - **Post-combat activity includes the force and means withdrawal**

phase, where logistics plays a major role in fulfilling these main
tasks: elaboration of redeployment plans to home military
quarters, redeployment support, deactivation of field logistic
systems, withdrawal of logistic forces and assets.

   - **Combat capability renewal is the final phase of troops logistic**

support a�er returning to the CR. In this phase, units are linked
to peacetime logistic systems. Used material and equipment
must be reconditioned, repaired, replenished and ready for
executing other tasks.

252. Supplies in the operation area are kept on the level of 5 standard

days of supply by the units and by the NSE on the level of 25 days
of supply.


_NSE is the key executive element of logistics support. Its aim is_
_to support its own troops and participate in collective support. It_
_operates as a single unit, possibly, depending on the operation’s_
_extent, it can be divided into an advanced guard with the supply_
_level of 5 days of supply and the main forces with the supply_
_level of 20 days of supply, and the main NSE forces supply_
_the advanced guard. Contracting and supporting units usually_
_form an NSE. The level of their use depends on the size of the_
_national contribution to multinational forces. NSE acts in the_
_national interest towards other armies national elements, local_
_administrative authorities and suppliers. NSE comes under the_
_national command structure and is a contingent commander’s_
_professional authority._


-----

253. Logistic support from the territory of the CR is done by a distri­

bution centre using supplies from the AFCR’s resources, material
and service purchases from the civilian sector and from state
material reserves administration (SMRA) supplies.

-----

254. Sources of logistic support. For logistic support in all phases of

an operation, the national logistic sources are procured and main­
tained at national expense, according to the following principles:

  - The CR’s armed forces logistic support is obtained from the

AFCR materiel resources, by purchase of materiel and services,
covering wage and personal expenses associated with contin­
gent deployment based on detailed expenses specification.

   - Civilian resources can supplement military resources. Civilian

equipment, goods and services can be used to provide timely
and effective logistic support for any NATO operation or
NATO-led operation. Support based on civilian resources
can be used only when it meets operational requirements of
earmarked forces.

  - The AFCR’s logistic bodies must take a flexible approach to

a logistic problems solution, look for new, untraditional solu­
tions direct in a deployment area with respect to an emerged
situation and received task.

**Host nation support**

255. Host nation support (HNS) comprises all measures with the

objective of providing civilian and military support, during
preparation and conduct of an operation according to Article 5
and outside Article 5 of the North-Atlantic Treaty, to allied armed
forces and NATO organisations deployed on the CR’s territory (as
host nation), operating here or just passing through[10]. It concerns
the following areas:

  - utilization of civilian and military infrastructure enabling

reception, concentration, further movement and integration of
these forces into composition;

  - ensuring required communication and information support;

10When providing host nation support to allied armed forces, individuals and
legal entities can be tasked with duties laid down in law number 222/1999,
regarding the Czech Republic defence. For stationing of foreign troops on
the CR’s territory during preparation and execution of an operation both
according to Article 5 and outside Article 5 of the North-Atlantic Treaty, the
provisions of law number 310/1999 Sb., regarding stationing of foreign troops
on the CR’s territory will apply.


-----

  - material storage including ammunition (temporary stores,

depots etc.);

  - utilization of military training areas (manoeuvre practice,

firing ranges for direct and indirect fire, cooperation training
grounds);

   - provision of fuel and lubricants;

  - medical support;

  - grocery support, possibly ready meals;

  - engineer and construction material supply;

  - drinking and industrial purposes water support;

   - electricity support;

  - allied forces protection in concentration areas and during

movement;

  - transport and movement control;

   - military and the CR’s police assistance;

  - lodging support;

   - repair of damaged facilities (roads, airfields, railway unload

stations etc.) used by allied troops;

   - isolation of detained personnel and prisoners, their support;

   - ba�lefield cleaning;

  - clearance of mines, EOD;

  - assignment of liaison elements of all organisations participa­

ting in HNS (including civilian);

   - translation and interpretation support;

   - cultural support of allied troops;

  - personnel and refugee evacuation support.

256. HNS conditions for military operations both according to Article

5 and outside Article 5 of the North-Atlantic Treaty are laid down
in international agreements, other bilateral or multilateral nor­
mative documents and standardized agreements (STANAG). The
CR’s HNS catalogue has been elaborated for initial planning.


-----

257. Numerous civilian services and organisations are used for HNS.

HNS tasks on the CR’s territory are from the allied commander‘s
side coordinated by the host nation support co-ordination centre
– (HNSCC), which should work close to the multinational joint
logistic centre – (MJLC) with the possibility of contact to military
and civilian authorities (transport, police etc.), including contact
to commercial organizations involved in HNS task execution. In
accordance with HNS adopted principles[11], the CR specifies so­
-called single point of contact – (SPOC) – MOD support section.

258. HNS has a second aspect too – using HNS by the AFCR’s forces

operating on the territory of other host nations. Military-strategic
command level authorities are obliged to create all legislative and
organisational preconditions for the HNS system to work in the
most effective way.

259. HNS planning. HNS planning and execution process includes

_NATO procedures on providing HNS are dealt with in NATO_
_military commi�ee document MC 334/1 and allied publication_
_AJP-4.5. These principles require potential elaboration of other_
_agreements and documents, for example, memorandum of un­_
_derstanding (MOU), statement of requirements (SOR), technical_
_agreement (TA) and joint implementation arrangement (JIA)._

three phases:

**First phase. Based on the task analysis, a state (states) requiring**
HNS specifies requirements on HNS.

**Second phase. The aim is to dra� a basic support proposal**
(usually called „Memorandum of Understanding“) for the HNS
conditions between the host nation and a state (states) receiving
HNS.

**Third phase. The aim is to elaborate detailed support agreements**
(usually called “technical arrangements”) which follows up

the Memorandum of Understanding for HNS and develops it
further. Technical arrangements for HNS contain details on land,
air, security, transport, communication support etc.

_If the HNS planning and execution process is done under the_
_strategic NATO command, then it includes five phases:_

**_First phase. Based on the task analysis, NATO strategic com­_**

**_Second phase. The aim is to dra� a basic support proposal_**
_(usually called „Memorandum of Understanding“) for the HNS_
_conditions between the dispatching nation, the nation receiving_
_HNS and the strategic NATO command. An appointed NATO_
_commander specifies at the same time, the HNS concept of_
_requirements (COR)._

**_Third phase. The aim is to dra� detailed support agreements_**
_(usually called technical arrangements ) which follow up the_
_MOU for HNS and develops it further. Technical arrangements_
_for HNS contain details on land, air, security, transport, commu­_
_nication support etc._

**_Fourth phase. The aim is to elaborate the host nation and a stra­_**
_tegic NATO command common plan proposal, which includes_
_detailed dispatching nations and host nation’s requirements and_
_a form of reimbursement for HNS provided._

**_Fi�h phase. The aim is operational plan improvement._**

260. Within planning and preparation of HNS measures, these tasks

are carried out:

  - regular consultations and revisions of NATO plans for mili­

tary help of allied forces with necessity to operate on the CR’s
territory;

  - se�ing apart required infrastructure to ensure reception of

forces, their placement, concentration, further movement and
integration into composition;

   - legal framework creation for allied forces operations on one’s

own territory;

- infrastructure build-up and maintenance, which is financed

within a NATO security investment programme – (NSIP);

- assigning part of medical capacity to support reinforcement.

#### CONCLUSION

The AFCR’s doctrine gives instructions on how to effectively

use the AFCR’s forces and means during joint activities in current
operations and when ensuring national defence tasks and state
security. Its use has a periodical course. Information from combat
deployments and exercises, development of military thought,
new technologies and a changing political environment require its
continuous update and by qualitative changes, even rewriting.


-----

#### GLOSSARY

**Alliance**
Alliances are based on official agreements concluded between two or
more states to achieve mutual long-term objectives.

It is an association of sovereign states, based on an adopted
international contractual act to fulfill political, economic or defense
objectives. It is characterized by handing over a part of sovereignty
to the alliance’s mutual authorities and by coordination of effort
in a certain field (military or other). Member states can void their
obligations in case their interests are endangered.

**Combat operations**
Combat operations are military operations in which at least one
of the warring parties has not consented to the activities of the
other side or to the activities of allied (coalition) troops, and which
principally achieve the objective by means of combat.

**Doctrine**
Generally, doctrine represents the summary of clear-cut opinions on
a specific subject. In the military environment, it expresses a system
of fundamentals and principles which directs the activities of armed
forces when executing their military operational tasks.

**Doctrine of the AFCR**
It represents a summary of principles for preparing and conducting
operations in which the AČR may be involved within a multinational
framework or independently. It is a mutual doctrine of all AFCR
forces. It creates the hierarchical framework and basis for AFCR
doctrinal documents.

**Coalition**
A purpose-built agreement of two or more states on mutual
procedures in solving international political, economic, military and
other problems.

**Combatant**
A member of organized armed forces, groups or units of one of the
conflicting sides, having the right to directly participate in hostile
actions.


-----

An armed forces member is distinguished by wearing a uniform or
by an a�ached identification sign and carrying a weapon in public.
If it is not possible to distinguish a combatant due to the nature
of hostile actions, then everybody who publicly carries a weapon
during a military clash, or is seen by the opponent when moving
towards a place from where the combat action begins, is considered
a combatant.

Combatant status is also given to inhabitants of an unoccupied
territory who, when an enemy approaches, spontaneously and
in large numbers take up weapons, carry weapons in public and
adhere to international humanitarian law principles. Provisions
of international humanitarian law fully apply to a combatant
who, when captured, is considered as a prisoner of war. Personnel
assigned to carry out non-combat tasks (for example medical
personnel, war correspondents, military chaplains) and civilian
personnel and children not engaged in fighting, are not considered
as combatants under the auspices of international humanitarian law.

**Crisis operations**
Multifunctional military operations outside Article 5 of the
North-Atlantic Treaty, covering political, military and civilian
activities, which are initiated and conducted in accord with
international law (including international humanitarian law) and
which contribute to conflict prevention and crisis solution.

**Peace support operations**
Peace support operations are operations in which diplomatic, civilian
and military means are impartially used, usually according to rules
and principles of the UN Charter, with the purpose of preserving
or restoring peace. These operations may include measures for
conflict prevention, peacemaking, peace enforcement, peacekeeping,
peacebuilding and humanitarian operations.

**Combined operations**
Combined operations are military operations of forces and means of
two or more states, which cooperate in task fulfillment.

**National …**
For doctrinal use, this term describes activities, operations and
organizations, carried out and supported by a given (member)


-----

state independently without the help of allies or without their
cooperation.

**National infrastructure**
Infrastructure provided and financed by a NATO member in its own
territory solely for its own forces (including those forces assigned to
or designated for NATO)

**National operations**
National operations are military operations conducted on a national
level by only one state.

**National component**
Any national forces of one or more services under the command of
a single national commander, assigned to any NATO commander.

**National command**
A command that is organized by and functions under the authority
of a specific nation. It may or may not be placed under a NATO
commander.

**National commander**
A national commander who is normally not in the NATO chain of
command.

**Non-combat operations**
Non-combat operations are operations, in which manpower and
resources of armed forces are used without the calculated use
of force (weapons and ammunition). In an emergency situation,
weapons can be used even in the course of a non-combat operation,
in particular for assaulted troop’s self-defence while performing
non-combat tasks or to protect civilian population a�acked by
weapons.

**Defensive operations**
Defensive operations are operations conducted with the aim to
stop the enemy, exhaust his offensive capabilities, keep vitally
important areas and create the conditions for subsequent offensive
action (operation) or conflict termination. The AFCR must be able to
provide all-round support and conduct defensive activities within


-----

a joint multinational grouping, carry out tasks to ensure the CR’s
territorial protection and redeployment and movement of allied
forces on its territory, integrity and sovereignty of the CR, which
can be carried out independently or as a part of a joint multinational
