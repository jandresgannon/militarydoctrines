## Foreword by the chairman

The Danish Armed Forces have undergone a dramatic restructuring. Where previously almost the entire
emphasis lay on defending Danish territory, international tasks are now playing a significant role in determining the focus of Danish defence. This has given Denmark an opportunity to pursue a proactive foreign
policy over the twenty years that have passed since the fall of the Berlin Wall in 1989.

At the same time, the terrorist attacks on the World Trade Center in New York and on the Pentagon
in Washington D.C. on 11 September 2001 have led to far greater focus on efforts to combat terrorism,
extremism and the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction. As a result, the nature of the international
engagement has changed – from Cyprus, Bosnia and Kosovo to Iraq and Afghanistan.

This has taken its toll on the Danish Armed Forces, in terms of equipment as well as personnel.

The Danish Armed Forces have drawn on their reserves and today are faced with seriously depleted stocks
of ammunition and training equipment. It should be a matter of course that the soldiers who are sent to
Afghanistan are trained on the equipment they are to use down there, but that is not the case. There is
therefore a need to raise the level of equipment investments in the long term if the soldiers we send out are
to be given the best possible protection.

By the end of 2009, the Danish Armed Forces will have approx. 2,300 vacancies. Balancing the books so far
has been possible only through redirecting the payroll savings to cover the gap. However, this is not
sustainable indefinitely, as the strain on the soldiers who remain in the Danish Armed Forces will just
become even heavier.

It is therefore vital to halt this development by endeavouring to retain key personnel and also by training
more officers, partly by increasing the intake on officer training programmes. However, it takes ten years
to educate and train a new captain, and it also takes time to train specialists. It is typically these two age
groups who are parents to small children.

It is therefore important to examine the distribution of total pay-related allowances between the deployed
staff groups, and at the same time earmark a sum of DKK 14 million for a new allowance that can support deployed personnel with family provider responsibilities. Of course, money is not everything, and in
this respect the Danish Armed Forces have also launched a large number of other initiatives designed to
improve the day-to-day working life of personnel.

Given the need to redress the shortages of equipment and personnel, there is little room for new activities.
However, the Danish Defence Commission proposes that new capabilities be established in two areas.

One area is computer network operations (CNO), which partly aims at securing the IT systems of the
Danish Armed Forces against attacks in cyberspace. The second is capacity building, which ranges from,
for example, assisting the East-African countries in building a peacekeeping unit that can be deployed in
troubled areas elsewhere in Africa, to training a unit of the Afghan government forces to take over
eventually some of the tasks we perform today.


-----

It has also been important to ensure that we do not experience a repeat of what has happened in the
present Defence Agreement period, during which the Danish defence coffers have been drained by
international operations. The Defence Commission therefore finds that all net additional expenditures
related to the Danish Armed Forces’ international engagement, including expenditures related to equipment losses and write-offs, etc. should be made visible in connection with the report on the net additional
expenditures that, as a rule, are covered under Section 35 of the Danish Finance and Appropriations Act.

All these proposals cost money. The question is where should it come from?

It is clear that the money is to be found either by discontinuing existing capabilities in the Danish Armed
Forces – and here the Defence Commission has identified a number of possibilities – or by increasing the
defence budget. However, it is not the Defence Commission’s task to make this choice; the final prioritisation of resources must be determined in connection with the adoption of a new Defence Agreement.

I have had the privilege of being a member of the three last Defence Commissions. In 1988, I was the new
defence spokesperson for the Social Democratic Party; in 1997, I was Minister of Defence; and on this
occasion I have been chairman.

A defence commission has its own dynamics and brings together people with widely different backgrounds: politicians, experts, military executives, and officials from the relevant government ministries.
Moreover, a shared knowledge base and personal relations are developed that subsequently make it
easier to find common solutions to difficult issues. In my view, the most remarkable aspect of this Defence
Commission is the broad agreement that has characterised its work.

Admittedly, one single party, the Red-Green Alliance, has written its own minority statement, but there
were six such minority statements last time. Only one party, the Danish People’s Party, has entered a reservation concerning the ESDP. And even though two parties are in principle opposed to compulsory military
service, and one party proposes that the Danish Home Guard be transferred to the civil preparedness
sphere, the agreement on the main lines of Danish defence and security
policy has never been broader during the last 150 years than now.

Let me finish by thanking the Minister of Defence, Søren Gade, for
giving me this unique opportunity to “revisit” Danish Defence. I
would also like to thank the members of the Defence Commission
for the patience they have shown. And last, but definitely not least, I
would like to express my thanks to the Secretariat, who have worked
very hard and into the small hours for our common cause.

Chairman of the Danish Defence Commission

## The premises of security policy


of these countries to potential crisis and conflict
areas and their actions in the international
organisations will therefore have considerable
and steadily increasing influence on the ability of
the international order to tackle security policy
challenges in the future.

Another consequence of globalisation is the
increasing competition facing the State from
other actors. Particularly in the economic sphere,
regional organisations and non-government
actors such as multinational companies and NonGovernmental Organisations (NGOs) will acquire
greater influence.


**Denmark is not expected to face a**
**conventional military threat in the**
**foreseeable future and therefore**
**enjoys a favourable and historically**
**unprecedented position of geostra-**
**tegic security.**

At the same time, however, globalisation has resulted in a far more diffuse, complex and unpredictable environment, where Denmark’s security
is challenged in other ways by a number of global
threats, risks and trends.


The international system is changing. The USA
will continue to be the leading world power in
the years leading up to 2025, but globalisation
will mean that in this interval period there will

-----

Within the security policy sphere, non-governmental actors such as terrorist networks and
organised crime syndicates are utilising the new
communication systems and network opportunities to challenge governments’ monopoly of
power to an unprecedented extent.

**New security policy challenges are**
**appearing in the wake of these de-**
**velopments. Globalisation entails a**
**redistribution of power and opportu-**
**nities, producing both winners and**
**losers.**

Furthermore, in large parts of Africa and the
Middle East, demographic, economic, climatic
and resource-related factors as well as political
structures continue to provide a breeding ground
for social unrest, political and religious radicalisation as well as local and regional conflict.


Globalisation entails that such local or regional
security problems can develop more easily and
more rapidly than before into global risks and
threats.

**The majority of the threats originate**
**from non-governmental actors.**

International terrorism means that non-governmental actors are for the first time challenging
our values and at the same time constitute a
direct threat. In addition, fragile and failed states
can spread insecurity in a globalised international
system and intensify the effect of the transnational threats.

The Arctic regions are expected to attract increasing international attention in the period leading
up to 2025. The continued melting of the polar ice
cap that is expected as a result of global warming will open new opportunities for raw material
extraction and the opening of new sailing routes.
The rising activity will change the region’s geostrategic dynamic and significance.

The threats and challenges posed by a globalised
world are too complex to be effectively tackled by
any one country. Multilateral solutions will therefore be required to an unprecedented extent. The
complex and transnational nature of the threats
and challenges puts the international institutions
under increasing pressure. At the same time,
there is a risk that increased global diffusion of
power could hamper efforts to reach the political consensus needed to give the international
institutions the necessary power to act.

Consequently, a need is seen for an active Danish
effort to enhance the multilateral cooperation,
particularly in the international institutions that
have the greatest significance for global security,
namely the UN, NATO, the EU and the OSCE.
Due to the common values shared with the USA,
the EU will have good opportunities to influence
the USA in a multilateral direction.

**It will be in Denmark’s interest to**
**support a development which sees**
**the international order continue**
**its ability to formulate multilateral**
**responses to transnational threats**
**and risks through international**
**military engagements.**


**Three types of international tasks**
**have been identified that Denmark**
**should be ready to participate in:**

**1.  Armed Conflict**
**2.  Stabilisation tasks**
**3.  International policing**

The types of tasks may overlap, in that a stabilisation task, for example, may contain elements of
armed conflict.

It is estimated that in the years leading up to 2025
there could be a demand for Danish contributions
within all these types of tasks. The unpredictability and complexity of the various types of tasks
underpin the need for developing capabilities that
are sturdy, deployable and sufficiently
flexible to be used in connection with all three
types of tasks mentioned.

In addition, the Danish Armed Forces will still
be required to perform tasks that are primarily
related to Danish territory: upholding sovereignty,
enforcing jurisdiction and contributing to the
national emergency and disaster response management system, including in connection with an
increased level of activity in the Arctic.

In parallel with increasing the scope of international operations, the previous distinctions
between peacekeeping, peacemaking and warfare
have been erased. The development has thus been
towards carrying out robust military operations
in unstable environments. Furthermore, these
operations increasingly involve complex “hybrid”
operations, in which military and civilian capacities, often from different international institutions, must coordinate and integrate their activities.


-----

The expectation that the technological superiority
of Western forces would enable future international
operations to be divided into either short-term,
conventional high-intensity operations or longterm, low-intensity peacekeeping operations has
proven incorrect. Instead, the most significant
development in the operational field in recent years
has been towards multinational forces engaging
in operations that focus on counter-insurgency. As
counter-insurgency operations are typically longterm in nature, there will be a need for the Danish
Armed Forces to carry out operations that are both
long-term and periodically high-intensive.

This development in the nature of the operations
places new demands both on the capabilities of
military force elements and on how the overall
effort in the operations area is organised. The
deployed contingents must have the capability

12


not only to fight armed elements such as insurgents, but also to provide security for the local
population, stabilise an area, engage in dynamic
cooperation with the actors responsible for civilian reconstruction and development efforts, and
participate themselves – to a limited extent – in
the reconstruction efforts.

The contingents must have the capability to
engage in both high-intensity and low-intensity
operations and to adapt continuously to the
changing nature of tasks in the different phases of
an operation. Developing the ability to participate
effectively in high-intensity operations will therefore be essential, as experience has shown that
force elements optimised for combat operations
are generally able also to function effectively in
low-intensity type operations, whilst this is not
necessarily true in reverse.


-----

As a result of the changeability that characterises
the majority of areas of operation, there will typically be a need to be able to act robustly also in
more low-intensity operations. Another characteristic of counter-insurgency is the need for international military operations to be implemented
in collaboration with local security forces as far as
possible. A realistic exit strategy thus requires the
ability to train and instruct local security forces,
which is defined as capacity building.

Consequently, it is important that the military
contributions to stabilisation operations are based
around multi-faceted strategies that include not
only political/diplomatic and civil humanitarian/
development efforts but also incorporate regional
aspects.

In respect to stabilisation operations, a strategy
should be drawn up from the outset that integrates the military and civilian components of the
operations. Similarly, a coordinating body should


be established to ensure such integration. In
addition, consideration should be given to establishing a model for the administration of funds
allocated to broader stabilisation efforts, including
coordination measures that can contribute to this
integration. Furthermore, emphasis is placed on
the need to increase and upgrade the Danish pool
of non-military sector experts and political advisers that can be readily available for deployment in
international operations.

Contributions to military capacity building will
constitute a significant task in connection with the
overall international engagement of the Danish
Armed Forces.

This applies particularly in Africa, where an
African desire to make greater use of own regional
security structures in tackling local conflicts will
entail that support for regional military capacity
building will become an increasingly important
task for the international community.


-----

Therefore, as part of the international engagement, the Danish Armed Forces should have the
capability to carry out capacity building, both in
relation to regional organisations and in relation
to the individual countries that provide troops to
operations in Africa.

14


In the years leading up to 2025, the demand for
Danish force contributions in international
operations is expected to remain at least at the
same level as today.


-----

The lack of predictability and the complexity of
the various types of tasks means that there will
continue to be a need to develop capabilities that


are sturdy, deployable and sufficiently flexible to
be used within a broad range of international
missions, ranging from armed conflict and stabili-
sation efforts to international policing operations.
In addition, the Danish Armed Forces must be **As of 15 March 2009,**

## The Danish Armed Forces – aims and tasks


The present legislation governing the Danish
Armed Forces is primarily based on the security
policy framework that was established in connection with the Danish Defence Commission of
1997. This security policy framework concluded
that a distinction between direct and indirect
security could no longer be maintained.

In connection with the premises of security
policy described in the present Danish Defence

led to an increased focus on preventive military
operations and to the need for Total Defence.

Agreement, it was deemed that the threats of
the future would not emerge from Denmark’s
geographical proximity. Therefore, the security
policy emphasis should focus on the ability to
counter threats where they arose.

New, asymmetric, dynamic and unpredictable
threats to Denmark and Danish nationals in the
form of international terrorism and the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction plus their
means of delivery had arrived on the scene. This
led to an increased focus on preventive military
operations and to the need for Total Defence.

the planning and implementation of military and
civilian efforts will be required.


Military operations in the future are expected to
require the ability to conduct operations that are
both long-term and periodically high-intensive.
Deployed units will therefore experience a mixture of the three types of tasks: armed conflict,


This entails that the particular capacities and
force elements, in order to perform their tasks,
must be designed to participate in all types of
tasks when participating in international
operations.


-----

Also in the longer term, the national tasks will
reflect the absence of a conventional military
threat against NATO territory and the unlikelihood of general war breaking out in Europe.
From a strategic perspective, Denmark’s sovereignty is secured through NATO’s Article 5
commitment to collective defence of Alliance
territory.

Upholding Danish sovereignty and protecting the
country’s existence and integrity will, however,
ultimately remain a Danish responsibility. There
will thus be a continued need to maintain capabilities for upholding sovereignty, such as surveillance and early warning and the capability to repel
violations of Danish territory. A higher level of
activity in the Arctic regions is expected as a result
of climate change.

Other tasks for the Danish Armed Forces will
be either pure regulatory tasks, such as the
operation of the national ice-breaking services,

national maritime environmental surveillance,
and the state maritime pollution control, or tasks
for which the national civilian capabilities in the
particular area are either inadequate or less wellsuited than the national military capabilities.

Furthermore, the emerging global threats and
risks mean that there is a continued need for
military capabilities to form part of Denmark’s
emergency and disaster response management
system, dealing also with such extraordinary
events as acts of terrorism and violent natural
phenomena. There will also be a need for
Denmark to maintain its contributions to


-----

international efforts in connection with major
disasters, including military capabilities.

In general, the role of the Danish Armed Forces
in the national emergency and disaster response
management system, including homeland
security, has changed however. Previously, the
Total Defence was led by the Danish Armed
Forces. Today, the lead agency is the Danish


Police, with the Danish Armed Forces standing
by to contribute with the means at its disposal,
including military resources.

Based on the information presented above, the
Act on the Aims, Tasks, Organisation, etc. of the
Danish Armed Forces should be revised. The
purpose of the revision should be to highlight
the defence of Denmark as the key task of the
Danish Armed Forces, but that this responsibi

lity will be executed further away from Danish
territory than foreseen in the premises of security
policy on which the 2001 Act on the Aims, Task,
Organisation etc. of the Danish Armed Forces is
based. In addition, a description of the tasks of

## The Danish Armed Forces – present structure


Partly as a consequence of the increased latitude
to pursue a pro-active Danish foreign and security
policy, the Danish Armed Forces have undergone a
transformation over the past 15-20 years from a territorial defence based on mobilisation to a modern
defence based on flexible, deployable capabilities.

The period since 2005 in particular has been
characterised by the implementation of an extensive restructuring of the Danish Defence, which
has seen the establishment of a completely new
and modern-day structure, aimed at ensuring
direct linkage between the tasks of the Danish
Armed Forces and the force elements they have
at their disposal.

All units should either be on deployment in
national and international operations, ready for
deployment, or undergoing preparation for
deployment.

20


The restructuring also signifies the final abolition
of the previous mobilisation units that have all
now been disbanded, and the focus is now clearly
on using the Danish defence capabilities for performing core operational tasks.

**The reorganisation of the Danish**
**Armed Forces was implemented**
**within an unchanged budget in**
**accordance with the present Danish**
**Defence Agreement. It was finan-**
**ced partly by extensive measures**
**to streamline and trim the staff and**
**support structure and by the aboli-**
**tion of the Mobilisation Defence.**


-----

By the end of 2009, therefore, the staff and support structure will account for only approx. 40
per cent of the overall structure of the Danish
Armed Forces, compared with approx. 60 per
cent by the end of 2004. Similarly, the overall
operational part of the Danish Armed Forces has
increased from approx. 40 per cent at the end of
2004 to approx. 60 per cent by the end of 2009.

In specific terms, the strengthening of the
operational capability will double the ability of
the Danish Armed Forces to conduct international
operations in 2009 compared with 2004.


sailors and airmen in international operations.

Changes in the conditions for the Danish Armed
Forces’ performance of tasks have meant, however, that the Danish Armed Forces have not
been able to sustain deployed capabilities corresponding to approx. 2,000 troops. Consequently,
in executing their tasks, the Danish Armed
Forces have been deployed in more geographically separate missions than anticipated, whilst
the assignment of troops-to-tasks has resulted in
an uneven drain on the Danish Armed Forces’
capabilities. In certain instances, there has been
a need to establish units and capacities that were
not originally in the structure, but were created
for the mission and task with contributions from
several elements of the structure and branches of
the armed forces. These developments, together


By the end of 2009, therefore, the structure of the
Danish Armed Forces will be dimensioned in
such a way as to enable it to sustain deployed capabilities corresponding to approx. 2,000 soldiers,

with the current manpower situation, have
impacted negatively on the present and actual
ability of the Danish Armed Forces to deploy
forces in international operations.

The streamlining and trimming measures implemented since 2005 have, among other things,
resulted in the closure of a number of military
organisations and defence estates, and the
subsequent transfer of a large proportion of
the affected personnel to other geographical
locations, often to other regions in the country. It
is the assessment of Defence Command Denmark
that the organisational changes alone have
placed a considerable strain on defence personnel
during the current Danish Defence Agreement
period.

An additional number of key areas have impacted on the ability of the Danish Armed Forces
to execute their tasks. The significant alteration
of the entire structure of Danish defence over
a relatively short period of time has presented
the Danish Armed Forces with considerable

22


challenges. At the same time, the Danish Armed
Forces have implemented the restructuring
process in parallel with carrying out increasingly
demanding missions.

Despite these challenges, Defence Command
Denmark believes that the structure described
in the present Danish Defence Agreement will,
as already mentioned, be fully implemented by
the end of 2009. At the present time, the overall
structure is planned to comprise approx. 17,300
military full-time equivalents and approx. 6,000
civilian full-time equivalents.

The structure of the Danish Home Guard is
planned to comprise approx. 300 military fulltime equivalents (regulars) and approx. 350
civilian full-time equivalents. This is to be supplemented by approx. 22,000 volunteer members
in the active duty structure and approx. 28,000 in
the reserve structure. Supported by subordinate
authorities to Defence Command Denmark, the
Danish Home Guard will provide approx. 900
officers and reserve officers to the regional


-----

command structure; a structure whose task will
be to command the total defence force of the
Danish Armed Forces.

Regardless of the structure being in place, a
significant number of staff positions will remain
unfilled by the expiry of the present Danish
Defence Agreement period. Similarly, the
significant changes in the conditions for the
Danish Armed Forces’ execution of tasks and
missions will entail a number of challenges and
imbalances.

Since the last Danish Defence Commission in
1997, the Danish Armed Forces have participated
in some 20 different international operations.
Several of these operations have contained
elements of all three types of tasks – i.e. armed
conflict, stabilisation tasks and international
policing – and several took place further away
from Denmark than anticipated when adopting
the present Danish Defence Agreement. As a
consequence, the equipment deployed on international operations has suffered significantly more


wear and tear in comparison with the use
of similar equipment in the domestic structure.
In addition, the deployments to climate zones
and terrain that differ significantly from
Danish landscape has led to the need to modify
and procure equipment that can withstand
extreme conditions from heat, cold, mountains,
stony deserts, marshlands, etc.

Even in connection with what are essentially
stabilisation operations, there has been a predominant element of actual combat. Both in
Afghanistan and in Iraq, the operations have
been counter-insurgency in nature, involving
periodically high-intensity combat; whilst in the
Balkans, the operations have been low-intensity
in nature, involving, for example, the control
of large-scale riots and the separation of the
conflicting parties.

The enemy that the Danish military contingents
have faced in Iraq and Afghanistan have made
increasing use of asymmetric warfare.


-----

24


-----

This has led to a need for the Danish force
elements to continuously adjust their tactics,
techniques and procedures, including using a
broader range of protective measures.

The consequence of these asymmetric threats is
that force elements in general need to maintain
a high level of readiness, even in places that are
perceived to be secure from a conventional military perspective. At the same time, it is essential
that force elements are able to take appropriate
self-protective measures regardless of the area
of operation, including the ability to eliminate or
evade threats, and to distinguish threats from the
normal picture of ordinary civilian life.

Developments within stabilisation operations and
counter-insurgency have led to the build-up of
new capabilities, such as teams for training local
security forces, close protection teams or teams
for assisting in the local reconstruction efforts.

The present Danish Defence Agreement brought
with it an increased focus on integrating Danish
military and civilian efforts, which has, among
other things, led to an enhanced general coordination of the overall efforts in the mission areas.
It has also led to cooperation between Danish
military units and advisers posted by the Danish
Ministry of Foreign Affairs regarding local reconstruction efforts.

**cultures has placed major demands**
**on the deployed personnel’s know-**

Danish troops have learned to handle these issues
by virtue of the skills and competencies acquired
through their upbringing and school education as
well as the focused, mission-specific training they
undergo prior to deployment.

Each year, a total of DKK 900 million (2005 price
level – corresponding to DKK 962 million at the
2008 price level) is earmarked in Section 35 of the
Danish Finance and Appropriations Act for net
additional expenditures directly related to the
participation in international operations, including expenditures on mission-specific training,
increased payroll costs, additional fuel consumption, spare parts and munitions, as well as costs
related to the deployment and redeployment of
contingents, and the establishment, operation and
closure of camps. The level of these net additional
expenditures has been rising in recent years.


-----

## Technology and equipment


The ability of the Danish Armed Forces to perform
their assigned tasks effectively, securely and
successfully is dependent on two core elements:
people and equipment.

As the Danish Armed Forces need to be capable
of participating in armed conflict, stabilisation
operations, and international policing operations,
special demands are placed on both personnel
and equipment.

The operational environment in international
operations has become more complex and more
demanding and as such has had a significant impact on the Danish Armed Forces’ need for new

well as wear and tear on existing equipment.

Participation in international operations in
recent years has necessitated an ability to adapt
rapidly to the changing operational environment, **During the present Defence**

26


in a proper fashion. The cost of not being able to
keep up with developments in technology and
equipment can, in the worst case, be the loss of
human life.

As technological and financial constraints
naturally play a role in overall defence planning, major equipment procurement, equipment
upgrades, and service life extensions are continuously assessed and based on the national and
international tasks that the Danish Armed Forces
are called on to perform. The aim is to ensure that
the Danish Armed Forces are able at all times to
generate sturdy and relevant capabilities to the
operational execution of tasks, both nationally


-----

and internationally – in support of Danish security policy. Ideally, the equipment of the Danish
Armed Forces should thus be capable of being
used for as many different tasks as possible,
including national tasks throughout the Kingdom
of Denmark (Denmark, Greenland and the Faroe
Islands), in international operations as well as in
collective defence tasks within NATO.

Cyberspace as a military battle space is increasing
in importance. This is due especially to the growing dependence on information and communication systems, both in society in general and in the
Danish Armed Forces specifically.

A number of technological fields should be given
particular attention. These fields comprise, for
example, radar and sensor technology (including
airborne surveillance) as well as missile technology; active and passive means of defence against
attack from rocket, mortar and artillery; and protection against improvised explosive devices.


**The report of the ”Committee on**
**the Equipment of the Danish Armed**
**Forces 2007” from May 2008 has**
**provided a significant basis for the**
**Defence Commission’s description**
**of the status of the equipment of**
**the Danish Armed Forces and the**
**Danish Home Guard.**

This report is attached to the Defence Commission Report as appendix volume 1. The report
provides an overall assessment of the service life
of the individual capacities, which in relation to
the Danish Armed Forces’ equipment systems
will generally have a lifespan of at least another
10-15 years.

A number of the equipment systems have, however, a remaining lifespan of less than approx.
10-12 years, which is why decisions regarding


-----

procurement of new equipment, additional
service life extension or phasing-out (insofar as
the particular capacity is not to be maintained)
should be made within the next few years.

Specifically in relation to the F-16 combat aircraft,
the report of the ”Committee on the Equipment
of the Danish Armed Forces 2007” informs that
Denmark has procured 77 F-16 combat aircraft
over the years, although the operational F-16
structure today is now reduced to 48 combat
aircraft. In accordance with the present Danish
Defence Agreement, the number of F-16 aircraft
will gradually be reduced to this number in the
coming years.

The security policy situation has changed considerably since the F-16 aircraft was developed, affecting how the aircraft have been used in practice.
Therefore, during the last ten years, the Danish
F-16 aircraft have been used for reconnaissance
and surveillance as well as support for ground
operations to a far higher degree than originally
anticipated. This has meant that F-16 aircraft often
fly with a heavier load due to the need to carry

28


extra fuel, reconnaissance and surveillance equipment as well as weapons. This has placed a much
heavier strain, and caused greater wear and tear,
on the F-16 aircraft than foreseen at the time of
their construction. Hence the Danish F-16 aircraft
are now expected to have a shorter service life
than originally estimated. It will not be the case
that all F-16 aircraft will reach their maximum
service life from one day to the next. Instead, the
flying time profile is planned with a view to
facilitating a gradual phase-out of the F-16 aircraft, with due consideration for the need to maintain an appropriate level of operational capability.

**In general, the updated F-16 combat**
**aircraft are deemed to be adequate**
**until approx. 2020, although the**
**capability will be gradually reduced**
**in step with the phasing out of the**
**F-16 combat aircraft towards this**
**time. From 2020 onwards, the F-16**
**will gradually become inadequate**
**for the purposes of Danish defence**
**within a few years.**

Maintaining a combat aircraft capability will require the Danish Armed Forces to begin phasing
in new combat aircraft by 2016, or alternatively
to extend further the service life of F-16 aircraft
and thereafter phase in new combat aircraft. In
this way, new combat aircraft will gradually build
up an operational capability that can supplement
and ultimately replace the F-16 structure, if necessary in step with the phase-in and entry-intoservice of the new aircraft

Developments in technology are not expected
to reach a level where unmanned aircraft can
replace manned combat aircraft in the foreseeable
future.

As the security of the deployed forces is to a high
degree linked to equipment, the Danish Armed
Forces have in recent years prioritised investments
in equipment that protect troops in international
operations. The Danish Armed Forces, therefore,
have brought forward the timing of such equipment-related investments in recent years, which


has led to a backlog in other defence equipment
investments. The backlog comprises primarily
equipment for training purposes and equipment
for force elements operating in Denmark.

The operation and maintenance of the existing
equipment is characterised by the fact that under
the present operational conditions the equipment
is worn out faster than before, coupled with an
increased need for continuous updating and
modernising. In addition, there is a higher
consumption of spare parts, munitions and fuel,
not only as a result of participating in operations,
but also as a result of pre-deployment training
gaining in intensity.

In general, the consumption of munitions and
spare parts - and thus the need for stock replacements - exceeds the level anticipated at the time
the present Danish Defence Agreement was
reached. The Danish Armed Forces have drawn
extensively on the existing stock supplies in order
to cover the increasing and changing needs.


-----

In 2008 alone, in connection with the deployment
of Danish forces in Afghanistan, 32 vehicles were
lost or needed to undergo major repairs. The total
cost of replacing or repairing the 32 vehicles will
amount to DKK 277 million. Added to this are
losses of other equipment items and personal
equipment.

The total cost of lost equipment will naturally
vary considerably from year to year, depending
partly on the nature of the operations in which
the Danish Armed Forces might be involved and
partly also on the number of troops and the type
of force elements deployed.

**In general, there has thus been an**
**increase in expenditure on maintai-**
**ning, updating and replacing equip-**
**ment.**


**The stocks of the Danish Armed**
**Forces in a number of areas have**
**now become so depleted that**
**procurement of equipment, muniti-**
**ons and spare parts is necessary to**
**bring the stocks up to a level that**
**meets the Danish Armed Forces’**
**new needs and NATO’s overall re-**
**quirements, and thus at an opera-**
**tionally satisfactory level where de-**
**ployed units are not forced to wait**
**for operationally critical supplies.**

Participation in international operations with a
high operational tempo has resulted in the loss of
equipment during combat engagements to a
degree not foreseen at the time the present
Danish Defence Agreement was reached.

30


-----

Defence Command Denmark has estimated that
the costs of equipment operation and maintenance for a structure that can sustain capabilities
corresponding to approx. 2,000 troops in international operations have in real terms increased
by approx. DKK 600-700 million annually.

The Danish Armed Forces find themselves in a
situation where the resources earmarked for
equipment operation and maintenance in the
present Danish Defence Agreement will not be
adequate in the future.


In relation to equipment, NATO has set two
general financial headline goals for member
states to achieve:

-  Devote approx. 2 % of the Gross Domestic
Product (GDP) on defence expenditure.

-  Devote approx. 20 % of the defence budget
on investments in equipment.

The principal objective of these goals is to enable
the Alliance collectively to meet its military
ambition level - quantitatively and qualitatively.
The goals support the desire for more equitable
burden sharing between NATO member countries.

In NATO, there is agreement that the two goals are
significant indicators in assessing whether a nation
shoulders its fair share of the burden, and thus an
indicator of the particular member state’s commitment and solidarity in NATO.


-----

In general, Denmark has also spent less of its
defence budget on investments in equipment in
comparison with our European operation partners. In 2007, Denmark spent approx. 14 per cent
of its defence budget on investments in defence
equipment.

In NATO’s eyes, lack of investments in equipment will mean that NATO’s military capabilities
are not updated and renewed adequately.
According to NATO, the ability and willingness
to contribute to sharing risk, burden, and security are partly reflected in the individual member
country’s equipment investments budget.


**According to official NATO figures,**
**Denmark allocates 1.3 per cent of**
**its GDP to defence expenditure and**
**as such sits in the lower half of the**
**group of NATO member countries.**
**The NATO average lies slightly**
**above 1.5 per cent.**

The annual figures on the size and composition
of the national defence budgets as well as the
international engagement of NATO member
countries show that Denmark belongs to the
group of nations which, measured in relation to
their GDP, allocate the fewest resources to
defence expenditure (input parameter). At the
same time, however, the statistics show that
Denmark also falls into the group of NATO
member countries which scored high in relation
to an ability to contribute to international
operations (output parameter).


In connection with the most recent review of
Danish defence planning (conducted in June
2007), NATO has recommended that the relation
between a relatively low input and high output
should be addressed in connection with future
Danish defence planning, with the aim of maintaining the present level of international commitment and the related transformation process.

## People – roles and conditions


short term, while other initiatives have a longerterm and more strategic objective. The latter
applies, for example, to the increased production
of officers and specialists. The effect of Operation
Bedre Hverdag is at present only vaguely discernible as a fall in the staff turnover figures.

To further ensure improvement in the personnel
situation, the Danish defence authorities plan to
launch a series of additional long-term initiatives
– described in the Danish Armed Forces’ manpower strategy – in order to enhance recruitment
and retention of specially identified personnel
areas, such as junior officers, staff sergeants and
skilled specialists.

Building up the defence workforce, including the
recruitment increase, will require temporarily
expanding the education and training capacity of
the Danish Armed Forces.

For reserve officers, a new education and training programme will be created with a different
purpose than that of the previous reserve officer
training programme. Where reserve officers were
previously trained with a view to performing
duties in the mobilisation force and the
territorial defence units, the primary aim of the
new programme is to train reserve officers who
can relieve and supplement the regular officers
in connection with the training of conscripts, as
well as subsequently act as operational
commanders in the regional command structure.

Pursuant to the Act on the Personnel of the Danish
Armed Forces, all staff employed in the Danish
Armed Forces, military and civilian, have an
obligation to perform service outside Denmark’s
borders. The duty to be posted abroad is thus
also a basic condition of employment for Danish
defence personnel.


**Defence Command Denmark esti-**
**mates that when the present Danish**
**Defence Agreement expires, there**
**will be a manpower shortage of**
**approx. 13 per cent in the Danish**
**Armed Forces’ military personnel,**
**corresponding to approx. 2,300 unfil-**
**led positions. Approx. 200 of these**
**military positions will be temporarily**
**filled by civilian staff.**

The lower manpower percentage has led to an
expenditure decrease on the payroll of the
Danish Armed Forces, which has partly been used
for implementing retention measures in the
personnel field and for extraordinary expenditures
in connection with international missions.

Particularly for the group of young officers and
full-time regulars that remain employed in the
Danish Armed Forces, the outlined shortage
means a significant surplus workload. For both
groups, the shortage of manpower has primarily
affected the operational units and the training
units. This means that the capabilities and units
of the Danish Armed Forces cannot be configured and trained to the planned extent. This in
turn means that there are fewer force elements
available to deploy and that the period of time
between deployments for the remaining units
and personnel becomes shorter.

In order to improve retention of Danish defence
personnel, the Danish Armed Forces launched a
series of specific initiatives in 2007 – Operation
Bedre Hverdag (Operation Better Working Day).

The initiatives are very diverse in terms of
scope, finance and effect. Certain initiatives were
quickly launched and will achieve effect in the

The period of service abroad for units in the
Danish Army is typically six months. For units
in the Royal Danish Navy and the Royal Danish
Air Force, the service period is normally three
months. Added to this is a mission-preparation
training programme, which in most cases entails
further prolonged absence away from home.
Hence the affected personnel and their families
perceive the actual length of absence to be significantly longer than the posting abroad.

**It is the goal of the Danish Armed**
**Forces that at least three years should**
**elapse between two periods of service**
**abroad of six months’ duration (i.e. from**
**the return home to the new posting).**

36


However, owing to the Danish Armed Forces’
present manpower shortage, it is not possible to
fulfil this goal. This is particularly true in relation
to specialists, where, for example, personnel
from the military police, IT, explosive ordnance
disposal, and logistics are particularly adversely
affected, with there being examples of less than
one year between postings.

While serving abroad, the personnel are generally
deployed 24/7, as the asymmetric threats constitute a danger even though the force element is
not under direct attack. The possibility of enemy
attack from rockets and mortars means that personnel can be exposed to threat even when within
the confines of a camp. A period of service abroad
can therefore mean great work-related strain.


-----

The process of reintegrating and readjusting to
civilian life for personnel returning from international operations is a task undertaken by the
relevant Service. During the reintegration and
readjustment process, emphasis is placed on the
need of the soldiers, sailors or airmen to spend
time with their families immediately after returning home from a period of service abroad. As a
rule, the reintegration and readjustment process
itself takes the form of a five-day event, which is
held at the local military base. The event comprises interviews with psychologists, medical
examinations, briefing about aspects of reintegration after returning home, as well as social
events. Three months after returning home, the
unit is brought together for a reunion event.

The Faculty of Military Psychology at the
Royal Danish Defence College (RDDC) has a
standing offer of counselling and treatment for
all personnel. Personnel can also seek advice and
support within, for example, the Veterans
Support Organisation (Kammeratstøtteordningen).


The majority of troops deployed on international service return without any physical or
psychological disabilities. On the contrary, they
experience personal development and strengthening of character. The majority of the returnees,
especially young soldiers, subsequently return to
a normal civilian life, entering either the labour
market or the education system.

The most serious risk that the soldier faces whilst
on active duty – in particular true in international operations – is the risk of being killed or
becoming disabled. As a result of the increased
involvement of the Danish Armed Forces in
international missions and the nature of these
mis-sions, the number of soldiers who are
seriously injured has risen. As part of its personnel policy, the Danish Armed Forces provides
help to soldiers who have sustained a permanent
disability.

be left facing a number of challenges of a more
practical nature. These might be in relation to
childcare, school contact, day-to-day housekeeping and upkeep, contact with family and
other networks as well as personal finance
management, insurance policies, etc.

As the conditions for deployed soldiers are expected to remain demanding, the need arises for
even better preparation of the family in the form
of information, with a view to securing the family’s understanding and trust, and thus support.

The Danish Armed Forces equip the military personnel with the necessary competencies through
a programme of education and training which
for many personnel encompasses a combination
of education and practical service.

The well-being of a soldier’s family during

importance to the soldier concerned and thus

The Armed Forces are engaged in ongoing efforts to obtain formal civilian accreditation for

Armed Forces, steps are being taken to highlight
prior learning and skills acquired in the course of
the soldier’s service in the Danish Armed Forces.
This includes especially skills acquired in connection with deployment in the many areas of
responsibility in the international operations.

Surveys made by the Danish Armed Forces have
shown that a salary comparison with the civilian
private sector is not normally the prime motivating factor behind a service member’s decision to
leave the Danish Armed Forces. On the contrary,

it is often the service member’s perception of not
being adequately remunerated and honoured for

Danish Armed Forces that makes them seek new
challenges.

## The support structure

The Danish Armed Forces’ support activity is in The aim of the reorganisation was partly to
general divided into four capabilities: Personnel, streamline the performance of tasks within supEquipment, Infrastructure & Defence Estates, and port activity and partly to trim the support strucIT. ture of the Danish Armed Forces.


Pursuant to the Danish Defence Agreement 20052009, the management and administration of these
capabilities in the Danish Armed Forces is centralised and brought together in four joint military
functional services:

-  The Danish Defence Personnel Agency

-  The Danish Defence Acquisition and Logistics
Organisation

-  The Danish Defence Estates and
Infrastructure Organisation

-  The Danish Defence Informatics Service

40


This centralisation and reorganisation is one of the
main preconditions that has enabled the principal
aims of the present Danish Defence Agreement to
be achieved. The centralisation has released personnel and other resources that could be utilised
in the operational structure.

In addition, the centralisation has made it possible to build up and maintain a high level of key
professional expertise within support activity. In
general, the implemented centralisation of the
support activity has enabled the Danish Armed


-----

Forces to perform the many demanding tasks that
they undertake today.

The centralisation has led to a major shift in the
way support activity is organised and carried
out in the Danish Armed Forces and the Danish
Home Guard. Besides the extensive relocation of
authorities and personnel as well as the creation

Relative size of the staff and support structure and
the operational structure in the Danish Armed Forces.


of new organisations, the changes within support
activity have also meant that cooperation and
cross-agency processes and procedures relating
to support activity have had to be changed for all
Danish defence authorities and personnel.

Thus centralisation has also had implications for
the individual member of staff and for each individual organisations and unit in Danish Defence.
Particularly characteristic is the fact that support
functions previously performed and administered
locally have now been centralised and therefore
appear more distant from the individual member
of staff. For staff, this aspect is particularly evident
in relation to personnel administration.

Experience to date and conducted reviews show
that the support structure in certain areas is undermanned. The principle that the support structure
is to be “just adequate” has, in combination with

-----

the Danish Armed Forces’ present manpower
shortage and the fact that it takes time before
newly established structures become effective,
meant that the operational units have not always
received the support they could expect.

The very establishment of the functional services
has consumed resources in itself. Extensive geographical relocation of authorities and elements,
in which a certain number of experienced personnel with specialist skills chose not to relocate or
chose to leave the Danish Armed Forces completely, has meant that the level of expertise in
support activity has in general diminished. As a
result, there has been a fall in production in the
functional areas. In addition, familiar divisions of
responsibility and cooperation processes, including communication channels, competencies and
interfaces between Danish defence authorities
have been altered.

In connection with the centralisation of functional services, a number of other tasks were also
centralised by the other joint military authorities:
the Danish Defence Health Service, the Danish
Defence Accounting Service and the Danish
Defence Media Centre.

In addition, the Danish Armed Forces maintain a
limited support structure within the three operational commands, including a Service-specific
maintenance structure. This is partly due to the

42


fact that certain support tasks are so specific to the
particular Service that they naturally best belong
there and partly that the operational commands
and other authorities need to possess a certain
professional expertise to enable them to act as
customers of the functional services.

To a certain degree, the Danish Armed Forces
make use of public-private partnerships to perform tasks. Public-private partnership covers a
number of different forms of cooperation, ranging
from close partnerships and traditional contracts
to less formal strategic partnerships.

The Danish Armed Forces’ experience with
outsourcing in recent times has been limited, and
occurs primarily within the operation and maintenance of defence estates and IT.

The use of civilian companies in connection with
international operations is an area undergoing
constant development. With a view to formulating joint guidelines within this area, Defence
Command Denmark is currently engaged in mapping the many aspects of using civilian contractors in military operations.


-----

## The Danish Armed Forces - development


A number of factors are estimated to have significant bearing on the Danish Armed Forces’
continued development in the years leading up
to 2025. One of the most important will be the
level of ambition for the Danish Armed Forces’
ability to contribute to international operations,
which is to be maintained at the present level. The
Danish Armed Forces must have the capability to
configure and deploy contingents in international
operations quickly and flexibly. In this regard, the
Danish Armed Forces must have the ability to
sustain deployed capabilities on international
operations corresponding to up to approx. 2,000
troops.

The Danish Armed Forces’ ability to meet this
objective is dependent on the ability to ensure that
all defence capabilities over a period are used in

44


the international engagement. Factors such as the
number and geographical spread of mission areas,
an uneven employment of the Danish Armed
Forces’ capabilities, coupled with the present
manpower shortage and equipment situation may
lead to the Danish Armed Forces’ specific and
actual ability to deploy contingents in a particular
situation falling short of the desired level.

Developments in military technology are so
extensive and far-reaching that in the future all of
the Danish Armed Forces’ capabilities, including
capabilities that are traditionally viewed as being
only manpower-intensive, will have a substantial
technological content in order to facilitate their
operation and integration into a network-based
operational environment.


-----

#### Level of ambition for the Danish Armed Forces’ ability to sustain deployed capabilities

The Danish Armed Forces must be able to rapidly and flexibly stand up and deploy forces for
international operations. In this regard, the Danish Armed Forces must be capable of sustaining
deployed capabilities in international operations corresponding to up to approx. 2,000 soldiers,
sailors and airmen.

Danish Armed Forces capabilities are deployed in the form of units, elements and individuals in
order to be able to draw broadly from the operational structure of the Danish Armed Forces, not
least with the intention of evenly distributing the strain placed on the Armed Forces’ personnel
and structure. Thus, sustaining deployed capabilities totalling up to approx. 2,000 soldiers, sailors
and airmen could be achieved through a combination of some of the examples described below.
The examples are by no means exhaustive. Note is made of the fact that the composition of the
individual forces, including their size, etc., will most often need to be adjusted according to the
possibilities for cooperation with other countries.

-  The Army should be capable of simultaneously deploying up to two units organised as battlegroups, as well as a number of smaller contingents. In terms of the structure of the battlegroups, their composition will be adjusted according to need and they will thus vary in size,
typically from approx. 300 and up to approx. 800 soldiers. Similarly, smaller-sized contingents
are also to be composed according to need.

-  The Navy should, with the commissioning of three new frigates, be capable of simultaneously
deploying two units composed of frigates, support ships or ocean patrol vessels (OPVs). Additionally, periodically deploying smaller contingents is a possibility in the form of, for example,
Flyvefisken-class vessels (Standard Flex 300) as well as the Danish Task Group Staff (DATG).

-  The Air Force should be capable of simultaneously deploying up to three contingents, which
will typically consist of transport aircraft, helicopters, combat aircraft, as well as surveillance
and early warning contingents. Furthermore, the Air Force should be capable of contributing
with a tactical staff along with a range of specialised personnel in the form of, for example,
support crews for loading and unloading aircraft as well as for air base operations, etc.

-  Additional contributions from the Army, Navy, Air Force and Home Guard will be able to encompass Special Operations forces, smaller units and elements designed for military capacity building, as well as individuals dispatched to staffs and as observers, etc.

Contingents must, in general, be able to perform normally occurring tasks within all three task
types: armed conflict, stabilisation tasks and international policing. Conditions in the specific mission areas, along with high-intensity levels, large geographical distances, poor infrastructure and
difficult climatic conditions can lead to increased strain and additional expenditures, which can
reduce the capacity for sustaining deployed forces or for the deployment of additional forces.

The Defence Commission finds that, with the above-mentioned objectives, the NATO goals indicating that at least 50 per cent of member countries’ land forces must be deployable and at least 8
per cent of land forces must be sustainable in deployment in international operations is met.


-----

The ability to distinguish between technologyintensive and manpower-intensive capabilities
will disappear in the coming years, but the Danish
Armed Forces should have at their disposal a
sufficient pool of different capabilities, so as to
allow Denmark the choice to participate in specific
operations with more or less manpower-intensive
contingents according to the desired effect.

**It is not possible in advance to draw**
**a direct correlation between the**
**number of troops deployed and the**
**associated additional expenditures.**
**On the other hand, the size of the**
**additional expenditures is depen-**
**dent on where and under which**
**conditions the particular contingents**
**are deployed, as well as the com-**
**position and the content of these**
**contingents.**

46


The unfavourable manpower situation constitutes
a strategic challenge to the Danish Armed Forces’
ability to perform their tasks, including the ability
to participate in international operations. At the
same time, the increasingly more demanding
operations in which the Danish Armed Forces
participate put heavy pressure and strain on the
Danish Armed Forces’ equipment.

The above-mentioned factors indicate that efforts in
the short term should be concentrated on securing
the Danish Armed Forces’ ability to perform their
tasks and on consolidating the ongoing transformation of the Danish Armed Forces’ operational
capabilities, whilst any development of new
capabilities should in principle first take place in the
longer term. In the short term, the aim should be to
alleviate the present manpower shortages and build
up the Danish defence structure to the level laid
down in a future Danish Defence Agreement. In
this regard, the Danish defence structure should be
augmented with the necessary number of
specialists, etc. with the aim of alleviating
recognised bottlenecks and securing the Danish
Armed Forces’ ability and robustness to sustain
deployed contingents in multiple mission areas.


-----

Experience with the present compulsory military
service scheme has shown, among other things,
that the proportion of voluntary conscripts is
very high and that the conscripts have a predominantly positive impression of the basic training
programme.

1 The Socialist People’s Party and the Social-Liberal Party have entered a
reservation regarding the text concerning compulsory military service
(Defence Commission Report, page 286).


It is deemed that compulsory military service will
face a number of challenges in the future, and in
the short term an extensive study of the future of
compulsory military service should be conducted[1].


-----

In connection with the development of the Danish
Armed Forces’ capabilities, a balanced approach
should be pursued that takes into consideration
both short-term and long-term needs. There is
need for a balanced and flexible defence that has at
its disposal a range of sturdy and robust deployable capabilities which can be used effectively in
both present and future operations and tasks.

Developments suggest that long-term military
operations in the future will be the rule rather
than the exception. This underpins the need to
ensure that the Danish Armed Forces’ operational
capabilities in general are sufficiently robust and
enduring to be able to support and sustain longterm international engagement. This should be accompanied by enhanced comprehensive approach
efforts. In addition, the Danish Armed Forces
should possess the ability in special situations to
deploy additional contingents for shorter periods
and at short notice.

There is a need to strengthen and enhance the
overall ability of not only the Danish Armed
Forces but also the Danish Government to conduct
stabilisation, reconstruction and development
projects in conflict areas. In this regard, a coordinating body should be established within the
central administration to ensure the integration of
military and civilian elements of the operation in a
comprehensive strategy when deploying contingents on international operations. Lastly, consideration should be given to establishing a model for
the administration of funds allocated to broader
stabilisation operations, including coordination
measures that can contribute to this integration.

The Danish Ministry of Defence, in cooperation
with Defence Command Denmark and the
Danish Home Guard Command, has conducted an
analysis of the operational command structure of

48


the Danish Armed Forces. In general, the analysis
shows that no significant financial, structural or
operational benefits are to be gained by altering
the existing operational command structure, but
an opportunity is seen for developing joint military
solutions within certain areas.

With respect to joint military capabilities, a
number of opportunities for development in the
short or long term have been identified. This
concerns, for example, the Danish Armed Forces’
special operations force (SOF) capabilities; explosive ordnance disposal (EOD); improvised
explosive device disposal (IEDD); counter rocket,
artillery and mortar (C-RAM); computer network
operations (CNO); deployable medical capabilities,
incl. the field hospital; and an enhanced ability to
support military capacity building at the regional
and local levels in connection with stabilisation
operations. In addition, the Danish Defence
Commission has considered aspects relating to the
Danish Government’s overall ability to implement
stabilisation, reconstruction and development
projects.

The tasks of the Danish Army in the future will
continue to be focused on international operations. In addition, the Army will still be required
to perform a number of national tasks, including
the guarding of royal castles and palaces. The
development of the Army’s operational structure
should be based on the battlegroup level, to which
elements from all Army branches can be attached.

Besides the ability to sustain deployed battlegroups, the Army should maintain an ability to
deploy a brigade-sized formation. In this connection, the Army should continue to have two
brigade structures at its disposal. Support units
should be modular and capable of being deployed
within the framework of battlegroups. The Army’s


-----

deployable capabilities should have the ability
to operate effectively in both high-intensity and
low-intensity environments and at all threat levels.
The Army should therefore have access to modern
and relevant equipment, and steps must be taken
to ensure Army access to relevant and adequate
equipment for training and preparation. With regard to land-based military capabilities, consideration is given to, for example, adjustments of the
main battle tank capability, fire support capability,
air defence capability (STINGER), long-range antitank capability (TOW), engineering capability, as
well as logistics capability.

The tasks of the Royal Danish Navy in the future
will continue to consist of surveillance and defence
of the sovereignty of Danish national territory and


areas of national interest while at the same time
providing long-term contributions to international
operations. The Navy’s capability to participate in
international operations should be developed, thus
securing the Navy’s continuous ability to sustain
the deployment of naval contingents. In addition,
the Navy’s ability to support land forces should be
enhanced.

In addition, new ship-based helicopters should be
procured, able to operate from the Navy’s larger
units. These helicopters are intended partly to
replace the present Lynx helicopters and partly
to contribute to strengthening the capability for
international tasks. With respect to naval capabilities, consideration is being given, for example,
to adjustments concerning frigates, patrol units


-----

(Diana-class and Flyvefisken-class), inspection vessels, strategic maritime lift capability (ARK project)
as well as environmental capability.

The tasks of the Royal Danish Air Force in the
future will continue to consist of surveillance and
defence of the sovereignty of Danish national
territory and areas of national interest while at the
same time providing long-term contributions to
international operations.

**In relation to national operations,**
**combat aircraft will be required to**
**perform tasks in both the short term**
**and long term that entail upholding**
**sovereignty and conducting air sur-**
**veillance operations. In international**
**operations, combat aircraft will face**
**relevant tasks across the entire**
**spectrum. The Danish Armed Forces**
**must continue to maintain a combat**
**aircraft capability for the purposes**
**of upholding sovereignty, conduct-**
**ing air surveillance and contributing**
**to international missions.**

Consideration should be given to how the costs of
the combat aircraft structure can be reduced in the
short term and to how the Air Force base structure
can most optimally be used in the longer term.

With respect to Air Force capabilities in general,
adjustments are being considered, for example, in
relation to stationary and mobile surveillance and
early warning capability, strategic and tactical airlift, surveillance aircraft capability, troop transport
capability (EH-101), observation helicopters
(Fennec) and search and rescue helicopters (EH-101).

50


The aim, identity and relevance of the Danish
Home Guard as a volunteer military organisation
will continue to be founded on supporting the
Danish Armed Forces in carrying out their tasks
and the national emergency and disaster response
management system, on the basis of popular,
voluntary involvement.

The activities of the Danish Home Guard should
focus on contributing to the Danish Armed Forces’
national tasks and also on contributing to the
country’s emergency and disaster response management system. In addition, the Danish Home
Guard should increase its contribution to the
Danish Armed Forces’ international operations
where possible. Furthermore, it should be examined in the short term how the composition of the
future Danish Home Guard force elements can be
adapted and streamlined in relation to providing
support to the Danish Armed Forces’ operations
and to the overall Danish emergency and disaster
response management capability[2].

As a result of the present Danish Defence Agreement, the main part of the Danish Armed Forces’
support structure has been made joint and centralised. The Danish Armed Forces should continue
this development, and the concept of the functional services should be maintained. The support
structure should be focused to an even greater
extent on ensuring that customers – including the
operational capabilities and defence personnel –
receive the proper supplies in the proper quantities and quality and at the proper time.

The Danish Ministry of Defence, in cooperation
with Defence Command Denmark and the
Danish Home Guard Command, has conducted
an analysis with the aim of identifying potential
opportunities for optimising the Danish Armed

recommends that the Danish Armed Forces and

## Resources

**The determination of the defence**
**budget in light of the specified needs**
**and the final overall prioritisation of**
**resources within this framework will**
**take place in connection with the**
**signing of a new political agreement**
**on Danish Defence 2010-2014.**

The Danish Armed Forces’ present manpower
situation and the significantly transforming
operational conditions have led to a changed
distribution of costs. This has led to a need to
repri-oritise, among other things, unused payroll, and to consume resources from the Danish
Armed Forces’ stockpiles and postpone investments in equipment in order to cover the cost of

52


the extraordinary personnel initiatives launched
and the rising operating costs that have arisen
due to the changing operational conditions.
However, even with the reprioritisations and
dispositions already undertaken, there is at
present an imbalance between the Danish Armed
Forces’ tasks and the resources allocated.

Developments in the conditions for conducting
operations have resulted in increased demands
being placed on the self-protective measures
of units and personnel throughout the mission
area as well as their ability to counter and evade
rapidly changing threats. The size and geographical features of the areas of operation result
in faster wear and tear of deployed equipment.
These aspects have significant implications for
the defence equipment area, including increased


-----

requirements to equipment procurement as well
as the need for frequent updating, repair and
replacement of the deployed equipment. Added
to this are costs associated with the replacement
of equipment that has been lost in international
operations.

As a consequence of the increased consumption
of munitions and other supply items in the
Danish Armed Forces’ international operations,
and the resulting increased need for education
and training of the Danish Armed Forces’ units
prior to deployment, the Danish Armed Forces
have drawn from the existing stocks during
the present Danish Defence Agreement period.
Defence Command Denmark has deemed that
the Danish Armed Forces’ stock levels are now
at such a low level that a one-off payment of


approx. DKK 1.4 billion should be invested in replenishing them. However, it is estimated that the
one-off payment can probably be reduced by up
to approx. DKK 500 million provided the stock
replenishment focuses only on meeting present
needs, particularly in relation to the campaign in
Afghanistan. On this basis, resources should be
set aside for replenishing the equipment stock
levels of the Danish Armed Forces.

Lessons learned from the Danish Armed Forces’
deployment in combat operations in Iraq and
Afghanistan have underlined the need to provide
training to troops and units in the appropriate
settings and with equipment in the same quantity
and of the same quality deployed in the mission
area.


-----

Defence Command Denmark estimates that
the important principle – ”train as you fight” –
entails that a one-off payment of approx. DKK 1
billion should be set aside for the procurement of
training equipment to be used by force elements
training for international operations. Initially,
Defence Command Denmark expects that equipment-related investments can be reprioritised
within the present Danish Defence Agreement
in such a way as to facilitate the procurement of
training equipment worth approx. DKK 400 million. On this basis, resources should be set aside
for procuring training equipment.

Defence Command Denmark has estimated that
the annual expenditure on equipment operation
and maintenance for a structure that can support
the configuration and training of capacities with a
view to maintaining deployed capabilities corresponding up to approx. 2,000 troops in international operations has in real terms increased by
approx. DKK 600-700 million. On this basis, the
necessary resources should be set aside towards
the operation and maintenance of defence equipment.

Defence Command Denmark has estimated that
an unchanged average annual investment level
of approx. DKK 3 billion on investments in major
equipment programmes in the period 2010-2014
will facilitate the ongoing reconstitution of the
Danish Armed Forces’ existing capabilities.

Danish Defence has launched a series of initiatives to improve the normal working day of
personnel and thereby counteract the high
unforeseen staff turnover experienced during the
present Danish Defence Agreement period. If the
initiatives continue during the already launched
Operation Bedre Hverdag (Operation Better
Working Day), this on its own will entail a total

54


annual expenditure of approx. DKK 300 million.
The implementation of further planned measures
– the Danish Armed Forces’ manpower strategy
– will, if launched, entail a total annual expenditure of up to DKK 200 million.

In parallel with these retention and recruitment
initiatives, the Danish Armed Forces propose an
increase in the Danish Armed Forces’ training
capacity, so as to be able to accommodate the
expected increase in recruitment. If the increase
in the Danish Armed Forces’ training capacity is
launched and maintained during the next Danish
Defence Agreement period, Defence Command
Denmark estimates that this will entail a total
annual expenditure of approx. DKK 200 million.
Added to this is a one-off payment of approx.
DKK 100 million for the expansion of existing
training establishments, etc. The initiative can be
adapted according to need.

New initiatives for supporting deployed personnel with parental responsibilities are estimated
to be implementable for approx. DKK 14 million
annually.

In relation to the above estimates, it should be
noted that the present economic crisis may have
a dampening effect on staff turnover and may
also bring along an increased return of personnel to the Danish Armed Forces from the civilian
labour market. It is therefore possible that both
the retention and recruitment of personnel will
improve solely as a result of the changed economic situation.

On this basis, the launch and implementation of the
above initiatives should be prioritised, so as to ensure
an appropriate build-up of the Danish Armed Forces’ personnel structure. The continuation of existing
initiatives and the launch of new initiatives should


-----

also be considered in relation to the economic situation and the expectations regarding developments
in the manpower situation.

In recent years, Danish units have been deployed
further afield from Denmark than earlier, and
there have also been a greater number of simultaneous large-scale contributions and greater
geographical spread than anticipated. This has
resulted in a number of structural bottlenecks,
reflected in the fact that the number of staff positions within specific areas is too small in relation
to the tasks that need performing, as a result of
which the strain and burden placed on personnel
is greater than envisaged.

Defence Command Denmark has estimated that
the increase in the number of staff positions
within specific areas is important for ensuring the
Danish Armed Forces’ ability to sustain deployed


capabilities in international operations corresponding to up to approx. 2,000 troops. Defence
Command Denmark deems that in the short
term approx. DKK 350 million should be used
annually to expand the structure and increase the
number of staff positions. On this basis, resources
should be set aside for alleviating the structural
bottlenecks described.

Defence Command Denmark has estimated that
in order to improve accommodation facilities,
shooting ranges and training areas and in order
to live up to many of the increased environmental regulations and reduce the maintenance
backlog in a future five-year Danish Defence
Agreement period, a total of approx. DKK 1.2
billion should be earmarked within the area of
military infrastructure and defence estates to
meet these additional needs, among other things.
Defence Command Denmark’s assessment of


-----

the additional needs within the area of military
infrastructure and defence estates assumes a
number of dispensations from the environmental
regulations relating to shooting ranges, training
areas, etc.

Consideration should be given to establishing a
model for the administration of funds allocated to
broader stabilisation operations, including coordination measures that can contribute to integrating
military and civilian elements of operations in a
comprehensive strategy when deploying contingents in international operations.

Defence Command Denmark has estimated that
the establishment of a capability for computer
network operations (CNO) and a capability for
military capacity building will entail annual


operating expenditure of approx. DKK 160 million. Added to this are set-up costs, preliminary
acquisitions of equipment and establishment
totalling approx. DKK 200 million.

Defence Command Denmark has estimated that
the cost of destroying the Danish Armed Forces’
stockpile of cluster munitions will amount to
approx. DKK 300 million. Denmark has committed itself to implementing this destruction by the
middle of 2017.

The reductions and discontinuations of the
Danish Armed Forces’ capabilities described in
the report could lead to significant savings. The
precise size of the total savings in connection
with the capability reductions will naturally
depend on which specific reductions are decided
as part of a new five-year Danish Defence
Agreement.


Defence Command Denmark has estimated
that the phased build-up of the Danish Armed

56


-----

the activity-based defence expenditure totalling
approx. DKK 4 billion over a five-year period.
The reduction figure has been reached on the
basis of financial calculations that take a point of
departure in a fully staffed structure. In connection with a phased build-up of personnel in the
period post-2009, there will be a resultant reduction in expenditure in several areas – e.g. payroll
as well as operation and maintenance of equipment and defence estates – in relation to the cost
of a fully staffed structure.


Lastly, steps should be taken in the short term to
ensure that the Danish Armed Forces’ allocated
resources are used optimally to perform the core
tasks. This is to be achieved partly by means
of a sustained effort to minimise costs through
continued streamlining and trimming measures,
and partly by means of constant follow-up on the
Danish Armed Forces’ consumption of resources,
and in this way create the prerequisite for
utilising resources optimally to meet present
needs.

## Recommendations

##### Introduction

This document sums up the recommendations presented in chapters 1-8 in the main volume of the Defence Commission’s report. As indicated in the report, the expression ”short-term” is generally used to
designate the period 2010–2014, while the expression ”longer-term” designates the period after 2014.

##### Security policy recommendations

The security policy recommendations listed below are a part of the security policy considerations in
chapter 1 in the main volume of the Defence Commission’s report and are included in their entirety.
Together with the Danish Defence Intelligence Service (DDIS) risk assessment, these recommendations
provide a basis for the subsequent chapters.

-  In the period leading up to 2025, it is expected that the demand for Danish contributions to international operations will be at least as great as it has been up until now. The unpredictability and
complexity of the various types of tasks dictates that there will continue to be a need to develop
capabilities that are sturdy, deployable and flexible enough to be employed in a broad spectrum of
international tasks, ranging from armed conflict and stabilisation efforts to international policing,
including combating piracy.

58


-----

It is essential that deployed personnel are able to perform in high-intensity operations. Furthermore,
forces must be flexible enough to be able to adjust to changing task portfolios on an ongoing basis,
in keeping with the various phases involved in an operation. It should be possible to maintain force
contribution levels over a long period of time and at great geographical distances.

It is expected that the majority of operations will take place in failed or fragile states. The Danish
Armed Forces should, therefore, have the capacity to dispatch instructors and advisers in order to
support the capacity building of local forces in parallel with, if necessary, participation in possible
high-intensity aspects of the same operations.

Based on an African desire to tackle local conflicts to a greater degree through the use of their own
regional security structures, it is expected that support to regional military capacity building will be
a task of increasing importance for the international community. It will therefore be essential that
the Danish Armed Forces, as an element of the international engagement, is capable of conducting
capacity building in relation to both regional organisations and the individual countries that provide
troops to operations in Africa.

The ever more complex nature of operations will place increased demands on the education and
training of defence personnel, including with regard to language skills, knowledge of other cultures
and the ability to act in concert with civilian actors, as well as require the ability to execute limited
reconstruction tasks when the security situation does not permit the presence of civilian actors. It
should constantly be ensured that Danish Armed Forces personnel have the best possible deployment conditions.

In regard to equipment, lessons learned from operations in recent years, especially lessons learned from
Afghanistan, indicate that there is an increased need within a range of equipment categories including,
among other things, armoured patrol and transport vehicles, airlift capability in the form of transport
aircraft and helicopters, as well as surveillance and intelligence capabilities, including unmanned aerial
vehicles (UAVs). Based on a security policy assessment, consideration should be given when determining
the future organisation of Danish defence to being able to contribute to meeting these shortfalls.

In connection with UN and AU initiatives in Africa, it must be expected that there will be an increased
demand for logistics capabilities in support of specific operations. Experience indicates that there will
typically be a demand for airlift capabilities, including transport aircraft and ships and helicopters, as
well as specialised logistics personnel. Based on a security policy assessment, consideration should be
given when determining the future organisation of Danish defence to being able to contribute with
the capabilities that are in demand in relation to the international community’s military operations in
Africa.

Denmark should pursue multilateral cooperation arrangements concerning larger capabilities, including lift capabilities.


-----

Lessons learned from international operations indicate that there is a need for an integrated approach to the planning and implementation of the military and civilian aspects of activities. In
terms of stabilisation operations, a strategy that integrates the military and civilian aspects of
activities should be formulated from the outset. With this in mind, a coordinating body should be
established within the central administration that ensures such an integrated effort. A similar structure should be established in regard to operations.

There is a need to enlarge and upgrade the qualifications of the pool of non-military sector experts as
well as the policy advisers who are available to take part in international operations at short notice,
both in terms of planning activities and in the field. Consideration should therefore be given to establishing a specific quantitative goal for expanding the civilian capacity. There will be a growing need
for including public communications within the sphere of operations as an integrated aspect of the
strategies for operations.

The Danish Armed Forces must continue to be capable of upholding sovereignty and enforcing
jurisdiction, including possessing sufficient armed force capability to meet the anticipated increase
in activity in the Arctic region.

The Danish Armed Forces must continue to be capable of contributing military capabilities to the
national emergency and disaster response management system.

Technological development and the increased use of cyberspace will lead to cyberspace being, in
the future, characterised as a battlespace where conflicts are fought. The Danish Armed Forces
should therefore possess the capability of protecting their own systems and preventing possible
opponents from being able to exploit cyberspace. Moreover, the Danish Armed Forces should be
capable of also contributing to the combined national response system within cyberspace.

Support to broader stabilisation initiatives in the field of security policy cannot, however, be financed
through the use of development assistance funds, as these tasks fall outside of the OECD guidelines
for what can be considered to constitute development assistance. A flexible framework outside of
development assistance should therefore be established for the purpose of financing such initiatives.

It is in Denmark’s interest actively to contribute to an international order characterised by cooperation.

Denmark should therefore work to ensure that the UN continues to constitute the foundation of the
international system as the source for global legitimacy and establishing norms. Furthermore, contributions should be made to enhance the UN’s capability for conducting peacekeeping operations.


60


-----

-  Furthermore, Denmark should strive to maintain NATO as a solidary and binding security policy
instrument for cooperation between Europe and North America, including its role of providing a framework for transatlantic cooperation regarding international operations and military transformation.

-  Ultimately, it is in the interest of Denmark to see that the EU’s ability to decide on and conduct
civilian and military emergency management is strengthened. Retaining the Danish EU defence
opt-outs is therefore not in the interest of Denmark[3].

-  Denmark should work to counter the threat from weapons of mass destruction and their delivery
systems through, among other means, strengthening the non-proliferation and arms reduction regimes.

-  In light of the complex nature of threats in a globalised world, security and defence policy research
should be strengthened.

-  Consideration should be given to conducting regular debates or hearings in the Folketing (Danish
Parliament) on the broader security policy challenges, with a presentation from the Danish
Government forming the point of departure for the discussions.

3 The Danish People’s Party has entered a reservation regarding the recommendation concerning the EU (Defence Commission Report, page 102).

##### Recommendations broken down by subject

**The Danish Armed Forces – future tasks**

The recommendations listed below are a synthesis of the recommendations outlined by the Defence
Commission in chapters 2-8 of the report’s main volume. The recommendations included here are
broken down by subject and do not, therefore, appear in the same order as in the main volume of the
Defence Commission’s report.

-  The Danish Armed Forces should be capable of performing tasks within the full task spectrum,
from humanitarian operations, international policing and stabilisation tasks to actual armed conflict.

-  The Danish Armed Forces will continue to be deployed against more conventionally organised and
operating opponents. It is therefore the assessment of the Defence Commission that the Danish
Armed Forces must also maintain the ability to fight and defeat these types of opponents.

-  It is the assessment of the Defence Commission that the need for the Danish Armed Forces to be
capable of monitoring the waters and air space in and around Denmark will remain unchanged. It
is estimated to be likely that, in and around Greenland, there will be an increased amount of traffic and activity – especially in the longer-term and especially at sea. In the future, this could have
implications for defence operations in and around Greenland.

-  As a consequence of the expected increase in traffic and level of activity, a proper risk analysis
of the maritime environment in and around Greenland should be conducted as soon as possible.
Possibilities for enhancing surveillance in and around Greenland should also be investigated.
Furthermore, a more comprehensive analysis of the future tasks of the Danish Armed Forces in the
Arctic should be conducted, including an analysis of whether or not advantages exist in entering
into closer cooperation with other Nordic countries, the USA or Canada regarding surveillance and
other similar tasks. The analysis should also establish whether or not surveillance and other similar
systems which already exist in other maritime regions could also be implemented and further
developed in regard to shipping near Greenland. The implementation of such systems will be able
to improve the ability of the Danish Armed Forces to develop an assessment of the situation in and
around Greenland and thereby focus the deployment of available operational capabilities.

-  It is the assessment of the Defence Commission that in regard to national tasks, the Danish Armed
Forces can expect basically unchanged conditions for conducting tasks during the period. There
will continue to be a need to deploy military capabilities in order to monitor the waters and air
space in and around Denmark, the Faroe Islands and Greenland, and there will continue to be
a need for deployment-ready naval and air forces to intervene in cases of possible violations of
sovereignty.

62


-----

The Danish Armed Forces will also, in the future, need to conduct domestic tasks in the national
interest including, for example, search and rescue operations, ordnance disposal and support to the
police, the tax authorities, and other such agencies. Apart from the Danish Home Guard, the main
rule should, however, continue to be that the Danish Armed Forces only participate in such tasks to
the extent that their capabilities are not involved in carrying out other tasks and when Armed Forces
capabilities are the best suited for the given task. At the same time, military forces should also be
required to perform such tasks in the future only to the extent that Danish Armed Forces capabilities
are, seen in terms of the nation as a whole, the best suited and to the extent that the use of defence
capabilities will ensure against the creation of duplicate capabilities under public auspices.

The Defence Commission recommends that the cooperative effort between the various actors involved in managing the combined national emergency and disaster response capabilities, which was
previously designated as “Total Defence”, be designated as the “national emergency and disaster
response management system”.

The Defence Commission recommends that the Act on the Aims, Tasks and Organisation etc. of the
Danish Armed Forces be amended as described in chapter 2.


-----

**International operations**

-  It is the assessment of the Defence Commission that developments indicate that long-term military
operations will be the rule rather than the exception. This underscores the need for the operational capabilities of the Danish Armed Forces – of all services – to be, as a whole, sufficiently robust and enduring to
support a long-term international engagement. Moreover, in special situations the Danish Armed Forces
should possess the capability to deploy additional or larger contingents, for shorter periods of time as
well as the capability to deploy contingents at short notice in connection with crisis management,
humanitarian disasters, evacuation operations, demonstrations of solidarity or of NATO’s commitment,
etc., which can be ensured through, among other things, participation in the NATO Response Force.

-  The Defence Commission finds that the Danish Armed Forces must be able to rapidly and flexibly
stand up and deploy forces for international operations. In this regard, the Danish Armed Forces must
be capable of sustaining deployed capabilities in international operations corresponding to up to
approx. 2,000 soldiers, sailors and airmen.

Danish Armed Forces capabilities are deployed in the form of units, elements and individuals in order
to be able to draw broadly from the operational structure of the Danish Armed Forces, not least with the
intention of evenly distributing the strain placed on the Armed Forces’ personnel and structure. Thus,
sustaining deployed capabilities totalling up to approx. 2,000 soldiers, sailors and airmen could be
achieved through a combination of some of the examples described below. The examples are by no means
exhaustive. Note is made of the fact that the composition of the individual forces, including their size, etc.,
will most often need to be adjusted according to the possibilities for cooperation with other countries.

-  The Army should be capable of simultaneously deploying up to two units organised as battlegroups, as well as a number of smaller contingents. In terms of the structure of the battlegroups,
their composition will be adjusted according to need and they will thus vary in size, typically from
approx. 300 and up to approx. 800 soldiers. Similarly, smaller-sized contingents are also to be composed according to need.

-  The Navy should, with the commissioning of three new frigates, be capable of simultaneously deploying two units composed of frigates, support ships or ocean patrol vessels (OPVs). Additionally,
periodically deploying smaller contingents is a possibility in the form of, for example, Flyvefiskenclass vessels (Standard Flex 300) as well as the Danish Task Group Staff (DATG).

-  The Air Force should be capable of simultaneously deploying up to three contingents, which will
typically consist of transport aircraft, helicopters, combat aircraft, as well as surveillance and early
warning contingents. Furthermore, the Air Force should be capable of contributing with a tactical
staff along with a range of specialised personnel in the form of, for example, support crews for
loading and unloading aircraft as well as for air base operations, etc.

-  Additional contributions from the Army, Navy, Air Force and Home Guard will be able to encompass Special Operations forces, smaller units and elements designed for military capacity building,
as well as individuals dispatched to staffs and as observers, etc.

64


-----

Contingents must, in general, be able to perform normally occurring tasks within all three task types:
armed conflict, stabilisation tasks and international policing. Conditions in the specific mission areas,
along with high-intensity levels, large geographical distances, poor infrastructure and difficult climatic
conditions can lead to increased strain and additional expenditures, which can reduce the capacity for
sustaining deployed forces or for the deployment of additional forces.

The Defence Commission finds that, with the above-mentioned objectives, the NATO goals indicating
that at least 50 per cent of member countries’ land forces must be deployable and at least 8 per cent of
land forces must be sustainable in deployment in international operations is met.

The Defence Commission anticipates that, in all types of operations, there will be an increased focus
on preventing harm to civil populations and damage to civil institutions in connection with conducting military operations. This demands that deployed capabilities are able to distinguish military targets
from civilian persons, installations, etc., as well as being able to strike individual targets as precisely as
possible so that harm to civilians is avoided or kept to an absolute minimum. This requires the Danish
Armed Forces to possess or have access to advanced intelligence gathering and surveillance capabilities
and that they have at their command weapons systems that are sufficiently precise in order to ensure that
the intended target is hit. Moreover, the Danish Armed Forces should have at their disposal a sufficiently
broad spectrum of instruments such that the means of force can be precisely chosen so as to mitigate the
consequences. Finally, consideration for this situation places great demands on, among other things, the
Danish Armed Forces’ operational training, including training in coordination between ground, naval and
air forces.

The Defence Commission finds that all net additional expenditures related to the Danish Armed Forces’
international engagement, including expenditures related to losses and write-offs, etc., should be made
visible in connection with the report on the additional expenditures that, as a rule, are covered under
Section 35 of the Danish Finance and Appropriations Act.

The Defence Commission finds that the Danish Armed Forces should focus on training language officers
specifically for the conflict areas where Denmark is engaged as well as on reinstituting Russian language
training.

The Defence Commission finds that there is a need for pursuing various options for acquiring language
specialists (language officers, Danish speaking persons with needed languages as their native language,
interpreters, local interpreters, etc.) with the appropriate competencies and at the proper rates including,
for example, through a cooperative effort with the Danish universities.

The Defence Commission finds moreover that consideration should be given to establishing a basic
language corps within a small number of languages that will have future significance either in
connection with deployment on missions or on account of the strategic significance of the countries
where they are spoken.


-----

**Comprehensive approach**

-  The Defence Commission finds that the concept of comprehensive civil-military approach to operations should be further developed and enhanced. In this regard, the Danish Armed Forces should
continue to be able to contribute within this area with their own capabilities as well with support to,
including protection, and training of other actors that can contribute to reconstruction efforts under
demanding conditions already during the preliminary phases of an operation.

-  The Defence Commission finds that there is a need for strengthening and developing not only the
Armed Forces’ ability but also the overall ability of the State to conduct stabilisation, reconstruction
and development projects in areas of conflict.

66


-----

**The Danish Armed Forces – overall structure**

-  The Danish Defence Agreement 2005-2009 involves a comprehensive restructuring of Danish

defence such that the operational capabilities of the Danish Armed Forces became targeted towards
contributing to international operations and towards contributing to Total Defence. At the same
time, the support activities of the Danish Armed Forces were streamlined and centralised in order
to transfer resources to the operational structure. The Defence Commission finds that this transformation should be continued during the coming period.

-  The Defence Commission finds that the Danish Armed Forces should possess a sufficient variety of
capabilities such that Denmark can choose to participate in specific operations with contingents that
are more or less demanding in terms of manpower according to the desired effect. Furthermore, the
Danish Armed Forces should have at their disposal a range of capabilities that facilitate both longterm engagements and rapid responses in, for example, crisis situations. This means that the Danish
Armed Forces should continue to maintain high preparedness elements at their disposal – i.e. forces
that can be ready for deployment at short notice – and to have the capability for rapidly deploying
contingents to areas of operation.

-  In connection with the development of the Danish Armed Forces capabilities, it is the assessment of
the Defence Commission that a balanced course should be pursued, so that consideration is given
to both short and long-term needs. Establishing new capabilities can take many years, in some
instances perhaps ten years, which is why capability development and the range of capabilities
within the Danish Armed Forces command should not be based only on the immediate needs of the
present, but also on a perspective looking forward to 2025 with all the uncertainties this involves.

-  It is therefore the assessment of the Defence Commission that there is a need for a balanced and flexible Armed Forces possessing a range of sturdy and robust capabilities that can be used effectively,
not only in present operations, but also in future tasks leading up to 2025. This would include having
flexible capabilities that are able to respond to unforeseen situations and tasks. In general, the Danish
Armed Forces must therefore avoid establishing capabilities that can only be used in performing
specific types of tasks or that can only be used in specific geographical regions. At the same time, it is
the assessment of the Defence Commission that, in the short-term, resources should be prioritised in
order to alleviate the current shortage of personnel and equipment in the Armed Forces.

-  As a result of the present Defence Agreement, most of the support structure of the Danish Armed
Forces has been centralised and placed under joint military organisations – the functional services.
As previously described, this has, among other things, made it possible to conduct tasks more
efficiently, thus allowing for resources to be transferred to the operational structure. The Defence
Commission finds that the Danish Armed Forces should continue this development, partly in terms
of the support structure, where any possible additional opportunities for appropriate joint military
solutions should be pursued, and partly in terms of the operational structure, where joint military
task solutions should be implemented when, from an overall perspective, they are deemed appropriate and efficient.


-----

The Defence Commission finds that, in the short-term, an investigation should be undertaken to
determine whether an additional integration of or changes to the distribution of work tasks between
the Ministry of Defence and Defence Command Denmark will provide opportunities for greater efficiency, with a view towards achieving additional rationalisation of the Danish Armed Forces’ staffs
and support structures.

The Defence Commission has noted the recommendations included in the Ministry of Defence’s
analysis of the operational command structure. The Defence Commission finds in this regard that the
organisation of the Home Guard Command should, in the short-term, be modified and made more
efficient, so that it is organised according to the same organisational and leadership principles as the
corresponding staffs of the other armed forces.

It is the assessment of the Defence Commission that, in the short-term, an analysis should be conducted to determine whether the local command structure in relation to the Danish Armed Forces’ contribution to Denmark’s emergency and disaster response management system could be made more
efficient.

Regarding the North Atlantic operational commands, the structure should be streamlined in order to
take into consideration the actual and expected developments in and around Greenland and the Faroe
Islands. The Defence Commission finds that Islands Command Greenland and Islands Command
Faroes should, in the short-term, be combined into an Arctic Command in Greenland with a liaison
element located on the Faroe Islands. The most appropriate placement for the Command on Greenland should, in the short-term, be studied and determined. In this connection, an investigation should
also be undertaken to determine whether it could be advantageous for the base at Thule to play a role
in regard to Danish Armed Forces tasks in and around Greenland in cooperation with other partner
countries. The modification of the North Atlantic operational commands should take place in a dialogue with Greenland and the Faroe Islands, where all parties are involved and have an opportunity
to influence the process.

The Defence Commission finds that the present development of the Special Operation elements in
terms of enhancing the capacity for cooperation between and integration of Danish Special Operation
capabilities from the Army and the Navy should continue in the short and the longer-term. In the
longer-term, an investigation should be undertaken to determine to what extent the Air Force should
enhance its present capacity for participating in Special Operations, for example by providing transport aircraft and helicopters.

In connection with the possible acquisition of ship-based helicopters, it is the assessment of the Defence
Commission that, in the short-term, an investigation should be undertaken to determine whether, from
an overall perspective, advantages could be achieved through organisationally integrating the Navy
and Air Force helicopters at Karup Air Base, where the Danish Naval Helicopter Service, and Helicopter Wing Karup are already physically located. The Army’s helicopters were already during the present
Defence Agreement period organisationally integrated in Helicopter Wing at Karup Air Base.

-----

It is the assessment of the Defence Commission that the concept of the functional services should be
maintained.

The Defence Commission finds that, on the whole, the support structure should focus to an even
greater degree on ensuring clients – including the operational capabilities and Armed Forces personnel – the proper support in the proper quantities and quality and at the proper time.

The Defence Commission finds that the Danish Armed Forces should focus development within the
area of infrastructure and defence estates on eliminating the maintenance backlog that has already
been determined, as well as establishing modern accommodation, education and training facilities.
In this regard, there is also a need for modernising the Danish Armed Forces’ shooting ranges in
order to, among other things, comply with environmental regulations. In this connection, an investigation should be conducted to determine which measures should be prioritised in the short-term
and which can be postponed with a view to completion in the longer-term, as well as for which
environmental regulations dispensations can be given.

The Ministry of Finance has initiated the establishment of service communities designed to serve a
number of ministerial areas, including one in the field of informatics. In the short-term, the Defence
Commission finds that an investigation should be conducted to determine to what extent the
Danish Armed Forces should make use of these service communities.

The Defence Commission finds furthermore that an analysis of the overall task portfolio of the
Defence Health Service and its interfaces with the public health care system should be conducted in
order to identify potential efficiency benefits for the Danish Armed Forces as a whole.

The capacity within the field of military psychology (psychological crisis services) has increased
in keeping with the growing demands of international operations. However, the present capacity
is being used to its full extent. Seeing as the present intensity of operations is expected to continue
at least at the same level, the Defence Commission finds that, in the short-term, an investigation
should be conducted to determine if there is a need for additional resources in this area.

During the current Defence Agreement period, the Ministry of Defence conducted an analysis of
the school structure of the Danish Armed Forces. It is the overall recommendation of the analysis
that the establishment of centres of excellence for the Army be initiated. The Defence Commission
has noted the recommendation of the school structure analysis.

The Defence Commission finds that, with a view towards enhancing the opportunities for additionally involving joint military aspects in the officer training programme, an investigation should be
conducted in the short-term to determine whether cooperation between the three current officer
training academies can be further integrated or whether all three academies can possibly be
gathered together under, for example, the auspices of the Royal Danish Defence College (RDDC).


-----

**Joint operational capabilities**

-  Ordnance disposal capabilities are in demand in national as well as international operations. The
increasing threat from, for example, improvised explosive devices in international operations should,
according to the assessment of the Defence Commission, lead in the short-term to a strengthening
of the Danish Armed Forces’ total ordnance disposal capability. This should include strengthening,
in the short-term, the capability of the army engineers in terms of ordnance disposal and countering
roadside bombs, etc.

-  The Defence Commission finds that establishing a Danish capability within the field of C-RAM
(Counter Rocket, Artillery and Mortar) – taking due account of the ongoing development of
concepts and systems in the field – should take place first in the longer-term. In the short-term,
developments in the field should be monitored. At the same time, the early-warning and protection
initiatives already undertaken should be continued and expanded. An investigation should also be
undertaken to determine how existing Danish Armed Forces capabilities (e.g. mobile radars and
artillery-tracking radars) can be integrated with or utilised in relation to a C-RAM capability.

-  The future threat against deployed forces from tactical ballistic missiles is deemed to require that, in
the longer-term, consideration should be given to establishing a tactical capability that can participate in monitoring and protecting deployed forces against ballistic missiles. Such a capability
would be able, among other things, to contribute to NATO’s tactical missile defence capability. The
Defence Commission finds that developments in this area should be monitored, and that the
Danish Armed Forces should, in the short-term, maintain and expand their knowledge and
expertise in this field.

-  The Defence Commission finds that, in the short-term, a computer network operations (CNO)
capability under the auspices of the Ministry of Defence should be established with the aim of
defending our own use of cyberspace and preventing opponents from exploiting it. Such a
capability should be able to be put into action in support of both domestic operations and deployed
forces. A CNO capability under the auspices of the Ministry of Defence must, furthermore, possess
the ability to work in conjunction with other Danish capabilities in this area.

-  The Defence Commission finds that, in the short-term, the Danish Armed Forces’ field hospital – as
well as the Armed Forces’ other deployable medical capabilities – should be further developed in a
modular direction. This will ensure that the Danish Armed Forces can flexibly deploy, according to
the situation, modern and relevant medical capabilities of various sizes and with various capabilities in order to ensure support to deployed forces, as well as independent, modular contributions
able to be used, for example, in cases of humanitarian disasters.

70


-----

The Defence Commission finds that, in the short-term, an investigation should be conducted to determine
whether and in what way the Army and the Air Force’s air space surveillance and early-warning capabilities
can be integrated, with the aim of ensuring a technical environment that is sufficiently robust and adequately
dimensioned.

The Defence Commission finds that the ability of the Danish Armed Forces to contribute to military capacity
building tasks should be expanded and that, in the future, the Danish Armed Forces should have the capacity
for additionally contributing to these types of tasks.

The Defence Commission finds that, in the short-term, the Danish Defence Media Centre should be developed
such that it can contribute with deployable capabilities to support deployed Danish forces.


-----

**The Royal Danish Army – structure and capabilities**

-  It is the view of the Defence Commission that the future tasks of the Army will continue to be
focused around international operations.

-  The Defence Commission finds that lessons learned from the Army’s long-term contributions to
international operations indicate that the Army typically deploys battalion-sized units composed of
elements from, in principle, all army branches and capable of independent combat.

-  Based on this, the Defence Commission finds that the development of the Army’s operational structure should be focused around the level of the battlegroup, to which elements from all branches of
the Army can be assigned. At the same time, the Army should maintain the ability – with appropriate warning – to deploy a brigade-sized formation.

-  It is the assessment of the Defence Commission that the expected operation environments, levels
of threat and types of operations will require that all of the Army’s deployable capabilities have the
capacity for working in both high and low-intensity operations, as well as under all threat levels.

-  It is the assessment of the Defence Commission that main battle tanks will continue to constitute a
relevant and necessary capability. The main battle tank capability should therefore be maintained,

72


-----

though given that the organisation and capability – based on the focus of the Army’s operational
structure as described above – should, in the short-term, be reduced so that the main battle tank
capability is to a greater extent dimensioned towards being deployed within the framework of the
battlegroups as a part of the long-term international engagement.

It is the assessment of the Defence Commission that, in the longer-term, consideration should be
given to the balance between main battle tanks, infantry fighting vehicles, other armoured vehicles
and un-armoured vehicles in combat troops. Included as part of this consideration should be,
among other things, the future lessons that will be learned in connection with the described modification of the Army’s operational structure towards long-term engagements and the focusing of the
structure on the battlegroup level, together with the operational experience that is gained in this
respect.

In the light of the necessity to replace the Army’s self-propelled M109 howitzer and the need for
precision fire support in international operations, and in the light of the previously described
development in the operational structure of the Army, the Defence Commission finds that consideration should be given as to whether the Army’s fire support capability can, in the short-term, be
reduced and modified to performing tasks in relation to the long-term international engagement.

Based on current operations, the expected development in the threat picture that is described in
chapter 1 of the report and the Danish Defence Intelligence Service (DDIS) risk assessment, it is the
assessment of the Defence Commission that it is less likely, in the short and the longer-term, that the
Danish Armed Forces will deploy contingents in operations where there is a need for Danish shortrange land-based air defence capabilities. Based on this assessment, the Defence Commission finds
that consideration should be given as to whether the Army’s air defence missile battalion, which is
armed with short-range STINGER missiles, can be discontinued, seeing as there is a demand to reutilise the unit’s radars in other capacities.

In light of the present and expected threat picture, in which the use of armoured vehicles by potential opponents must be deemed to be less likely, the Defence Commission finds that consideration
should be given as to whether the Army’s anti-tank capability based on TOW anti-tank missiles can
be discontinued.

The ability of the Army to support long-term deployments should, according to the assessment of the
Defence Commission, be enhanced in the short-term. In this connection, the logistics and
administrative capabilities of the Army should be strengthened, for example through the introduction
of more armoured logistics vehicles as well as through the recruitment of more specialists.

It is the evaluation of the Defence Commission that the Army’s deployable capabilities will continue
to need to be assigned to NATO’s deployable forces. Moreover, expectations are that the Army will
occasionally be required to contribute to the NATO Response Force.


-----

**The Royal Danish Navy – structure and capabilities**

-  It is the view of the Defence Commission that the future tasks of the Navy will continue to consist
of surveillance and defence of the sovereignty of Danish national territory and areas of national
interest while at the same time providing long-term contributions to international operations.

-  The Defence Commission finds that the capability of the Navy to participate in international
operations should be developed so that the capability of sustaining deployed maritime contingents
is ensured. Furthermore, the Navy’s ability to provide support to ground-deployed units should be
expanded.

-  In the future, the larger units of the Navy will consist of three frigates, two flexible support ships
and four ocean patrol vessels (OPVs). With regard to frigate capacity, it is the evaluation of the
Defence Commission that, in the short-term, efforts should be concentrated on commissioning the
frigates, including training their crew. In order to optimise the ability of the frigates to provide fire
support for units ashore, consideration can, in the longer-term, be given to acquiring systems that
are capable of providing fire support to land operations.

-  In order to enhance the capability of the larger units, they should, in the short-term, be supplemented with new ship-based helicopters that are, at the same time, intended to replace the current
Lynx helicopters. According to the assessment of the Defence Commission, a helicopter type should
be chosen that can flexibly support units in carrying out tasks, both internationally and in the North
Atlantic, i.e. perform tasks in relation to, among other things, transport, surveillance and search and
rescue operations. Emphasis should be placed on helicopters that can, among other things, enhance
the capability for supporting ground operations. Furthermore, such helicopters should possess selfdefence capabilities with a view to deployment in international operations.

-  The Navy’s capabilities for surveillance and upholding Danish sovereignty in Danish territorial

waters should be developed so that phasing in modern units and capabilities allows for improved
task efficiency. At the same time, the role of the Naval Home Guard in carrying out these tasks
should be enhanced and developed. The Defence Commission finds that, in the short term, in
connection with the phasing in of Diana-class vessels, an investigation should be conducted to
determine whether a number of the existing Flyvefisken-class patrol units can be phased out and
their tasks in terms of patrolling Danish territorial waters be taken over, for example by the existing
Diana-class units.

-  In regard to the North Atlantic region, it is the assessment of the Defence Commission that the last
inspection cutter in Greenland – which in the short-term will be operationally and technologically
obsolete – should be replaced with a new inspection vessel. This must also be seen in the light of the
altered traffic pattern near Greenland and the subsequent necessity for being able to operate further
from the coast.

74


-----

On the basis of the descriptions of the future conditions and international tasks of the Danish
Armed Forces, it is estimated that there will be an increased need for a strategic maritime lift
capability. With the ARK project, Denmark possesses a valuable strategic maritime lift capability.
The Defence Commission finds that the ARK concept should be developed further in keeping with
the national and international demand for maritime lift capability.

The Defence Commission finds that, in the longer-term, the Armed Forces’ environmental protection vessels should be replaced. The possibility for completely or partially outsourcing the task
of environmental protection or in other ways acquiring an environmental protection capability
should, in the short-term, be investigated. Such an investigation should include determining the
possibility for additionally employing the Naval Home Guard’s capabilities in this field. Similar
considerations should be made concerning Denmark’s ice-breaking capability.

The capabilities of the Navy will, according to the evaluation of the Defence Commission, continue
to need to be assigned to NATO. The assignment should reflect both the capability for long-term
deployments as well as for concentrated efforts of shorter duration. Furthermore, expectations are
that the Navy will be required to contribute to the NATO Response Force.


-----

**The Royal Danish Air Force – structure and capabilities**

-  According to the assessment of the Defence Commission, the future tasks of the Air Force will
continue to be surveillance and upholding the sovereignty of Danish national air space and areas of
national interest, while at the same time providing long-term contributions to international operations. Along with focusing on the capability for long-term deployment of contingents, the Air Force
should maintain the capability for carrying out concentrated efforts of shorter duration in connection with intensive operations.

-  With regard to combat aircraft, it is the evaluation of the Defence Commission that, in connection
with domestic operations in both the short and the longer-term, tasks must include upholding the
sovereignty of domestic air space as well as the surveillance of areas of national interest. In connection with an analysis of the future task assignments in the Arctic region, consideration can also be
given to utilising, for example, combat aircraft in the occasional performance of tasks in relation to
surveillance and upholding sovereignty in and around Greenland.

-  In summary, it is the assessment of the Defence Commission that the Danish Armed Forces must
continue to maintain a combat aircraft capability in order to uphold the sovereignty of Danish air
space as well as for the surveillance of areas of national interest. Furthermore, the Danish Armed
Forces must continue to maintain the capability for deploying combat aircraft in international
operations.

-  According to the view of the Defence Commission, consideration should, in the short-term, be
given as to how the expenses involving the combat aircraft structure can be reduced. In connection
with a possible decision to acquire and phase in a new type of combat aircraft, consideration should
be given as to how the air base structure can be optimally utilised in the longer-term.

-  The Defence Commission finds that the national stationary control and warning centre in Karup
should be maintained. An investigation should be undertaken on the basis of the current phasing in
of new surveillance radars to determine whether the surveillance of domestic air space can be made
more efficient. In the short-term, the ongoing establishment of a modular-based mobile control and
warning centre that can be deployed in international operations should be continued. The mobile
control and warning centre can, moreover, enhance Denmark’s capacity to carry out national tasks
in this area if the need arises, including, for example, in Greenland.

-  In terms of air transport, need is apparent for both strategic and tactical air transport. Regarding
strategic air transport, the Defence Commission finds that the initiatives concerning chartering
civilian transport aircraft on a full-time basis should, in the short-term, be continued. Moreover,
possible multinational solutions in this area should be investigated and, if possible, pursued.

76


-----

The capability for tactical air transport consists of four C-130J aircraft. It is the view of the Defence
Commission that, in the short-term, this capability, including the training of crew members, should
undergo consolidation. In the longer-term, the capacity to participate in SOF operations should be
enhanced. Moreover, in the longer-term, consideration should also be given to acquiring additional
transport aircraft capability.

Troop transport helicopters are a resource that is in great demand in connection with international
operations. Up until now, the Danish Armed Forces have not possessed a dedicated troop transport
helicopter capability. Six EH-101 helicopters are, however, being implemented for carrying out troop
transport tasks. The Defence Commission finds that, in the short-term, this capability should be established and deployed on international operations. This includes establishing the necessary logistical
support involved. In the longer-term, consideration can be given to strengthening the troop transport
helicopter capability, including establishing the capability for participating in Special Forces operations.

The Armed Forces’ observation helicopters (Fennec) are used to carry out, among other things,
international tasks, providing support to civilian authorities as well as tasks involving school and
training flights. The Defence Commission finds that, in the short-term, consideration should be
given to the composition and scope of the tasks involving this capability, including determining
whether or not the international capacity could possibly be discontinued.

The Defence Commission finds that the Danish Armed Forces should retain the structure for being
able to sustain air and helicopter contributions deployed outside of Denmark for longer periods
of time, including the deployment of C130J Hercules aircraft. This structure can be expedient in
relation to deployment in international mission areas. At the same time, such a structure is seen as
relevant in relation to carrying out national tasks in the Arctic region.

The Defence Commission finds that, in the short-term, possibilities for enhancing the performance
of patrol aircraft in and around Greenland should be investigated. Additionally, an investigation
should be conducted to determine whether, in the longer-term, unmanned aircraft systems and
satellite-based surveillance could take on some of the tasks that patrol aircraft currently perform.

It is the evaluation of the Defence Commission that the ability of the Danish Armed Forces to
conduct search and rescue tasks must be maintained. Given the phasing in of the modern EH-101
search and rescue helicopter, which possesses greater performance, consideration should, in the
short-term, be given as to how task performance can be streamlined through, for example, differentiating the level of readiness according to the time of year and traffic patterns.

According to the view of the Defence Commission, the deployable capabilities of the Air Force will
continue to need to be assigned to NATO. The assignment should reflect both the capability for
long-term deployments as well as for concentrated efforts of shorter duration. Moreover, expectations
are that the Air Force will continue to be required to contribute to the NATO Response Force.


-----

**The Danish Home Guard [4]**

-  The primary aim, identity and relevance of the Home Guard as a voluntary military organisation
will, according to the view of the Defence Commission, continue to be founded on supporting the
commitments of the Danish Armed Forces as well as contributing to the overall national emergency
and disaster response management system, on the basis of a popular, voluntary commitment.

4 The Socialist People’s Party has entered a reservation regarding the recommendations concerning the Danish Home Guard (Defence Commission Report, page 301).

78


-----

According to the evaluation of the Defence Commission, the Home Guard should focus its contribution
on the domestic commitments of the Armed Forces, first and foremost on guarding responsibilities.
Furthermore, the Home Guard should continue and to the extent possible increase their contribution
to the Armed Forces’ international commitments in terms of, among other things, guarding activities
and other relevant functions, not least activities in connection with civil reconstruction supporting
the Armed Forces as well as other cooperation partners. Based on these comments, the Defence
Commission finds that the Home Guard’s national contribution should similarly continue to be
developed in support of Denmark’s general emergency and disaster response management system
through an efficient utilisation of their combined capabilities. With an increase of the reserve-officer
capacity, it should, moreover, be possible to conduct a qualitative strengthening and streamlining of the
regional command structure.

Moreover, according to the view of the Defence Commission, an investigation should, in the shortterm, be conducted to determine how the future composition of the Home Guard units can be
modified and additionally streamlined in relation to conducting Danish Armed Forces tasks and
participating in the combined national emergency and disaster response management system, for
example through support from the Police Home Guard as well as performing guarding responsibilities. In this respect, the Infrastructure Home Guard should undergo development.

The Defence Commission finds that in order to improve the possibilities for the Home Guard to
support the Danish Armed Forces and Danish civil society, in the short-term adequate compensation
should be ensured for volunteers in order to cover lost earnings, inconveniences, etc. when volunteer
Home Guard personnel provide long-term service in support of the Danish Armed Forces and the
country in general.

According to the evaluation of the Defence Commission, the requirements demanded of active Home
Guard membership in the highest priority units must therefore be expected to increase and, to this
end, it must be ensured that the relevant educational and training requirements for the various unit
types are maintained and that appropriations are used efficiently.


-----

**The Danish Armed Forces – equipment**

-  The Defence Commission finds that, in the future, sufficient resources should be ensured for the
operation and maintenance of the equipment that falls within the structure of the Danish Armed
Forces.

-  The Defence Commission finds that the development of the Danish Armed Forces must, in the
short-term, take into consideration the fact that the equipment capacity and stock supplies of the
Danish Armed Forces should be expanded and proportioned in relation to current conditions.

-  The Defence Commission finds that the amount and quality of the equipment available for domestically-based training should be prioritised so that units preparing for specific deployments have
access to the same types of equipment used in the mission areas, while the other units in training
and those standing ready to be deployed have access to modern and relevant equipment.

**Compulsory military service scheme[5 ]**

-  It is the view of the Defence Commission that the new compulsory military service scheme has
fulfilled the aim laid out in the Defence Agreement 2005-2009. The Total Defence register has been
established and the Danish Armed Forces have been able to recruit sufficient personnel from the
conscripts for subsequent response force training and deployment in international operations.

-  In general, it is the evaluation of Defence Command Denmark that the compulsory military service
scheme has been a success and that the basic training for conscripts is suitable both in terms of
length and content with a view towards preparing the conscripts for subsequently either standing
ready to serve as part of Denmark’s emergency and disaster response management system or
continuing as employees in the Danish Armed Forces on deployable forces contracts.

-  At the same time though, it is the evaluation of the Defence Commission that the response force
training for those who sign response force contracts during their basic training with a view towards
further training and deployment in international operations can be characterised as being extremely
complex and compressed.

-  The Defence Commission finds that – seen in the light of, among other things, the current problems
regarding manpower in the Danish Armed Forces, together with the complex and intense environment that it is expected Danish military personnel will have to work in while conducting future
Danish defence tasks – it should be ensured in the future that the Danish Armed Forces have the
best and broadest foundation for recruitment. The recruitment effort must be focused on the entire
annual cohort of young people (approx. 65,000) and not only the approx. 6,500 young people who
annually serve their compulsory service in the Danish Armed Forces.

5 The Socialist People’s Party and the Social Liberal Party have entered a reservation regarding the recommendations concerning compulsory military service
(Defence Commission Report, page 286).

80


-----

The Defence Commission finds that, in the future, compulsory military service faces a number of
challenges. Furthermore, the Defence Commission has noted the fact that a number of comparable
European countries have discontinued compulsory military service, while other comparable countries have decided to maintain compulsory military service.

In this context, the Defence Commission finds that, in the short-term, consideration should be
given to additionally improving the training for conscripts so that the training of those conscripts
who wish to continue on in the Danish Armed Forces can be strengthened in the direction of their
coming tasks; while the training of the conscripts who do not continue on in the Danish Armed
Forces can be strengthened in the direction of performing tasks related to the combined national
emergency and disaster response management system. In this way, the final part of the conscripts’
training for those wishing to sign response force contracts can be targeted towards their subsequent
response force training.

Furthermore, the Defence Commission finds that, in the short-term, a comprehensive study of the
future of compulsory military service should be conducted. As part of the study, the present and
future challenges to compulsory military service should be identified and addressed. Such a study
should analyse how compulsory military service can be optimally organised in the future and
identify possible opportunities for introducing alternatives to the current compulsory military
service scheme. Furthermore, the study should shed light on the significance of compulsory military
service in terms of the people’s will to defence and the public anchoring of the Danish Armed Forces,
along with the opinion-forming and educative significance that compulsory military service has
for conscripts. The study should furthermore examine the possible options for the Danish Armed
Forces, either without compulsory military service or with an increased intake of conscripts, to carry
out the tasks involved in Danish defence, including the Danish Armed Forces’ international tasks,
contributing to the combined national emergency and disaster response management system as well
as tasks that are conducted in support of the Royal Family, etc. The study should, at the same time,
examine the Danish Armed Forces’ possibilities for broad-based recruitment so that the composition
of the Danish Armed Forces’ personnel reflects to the greatest degree possible Danish society,
including the possibilities for recruiting more women and more young people with different
educational backgrounds. The study of the aspects of compulsory military service should furthermore involve aspects outside of the Danish Armed Forces that are also related to compulsory military
service, such as the Danish Emergency Management Agency (DEMA) and the Conscientious Objecter
Administration (Militærnægteradministrationen), etc.


-----

**People**

-  The Defence Commission finds that the necessary initiatives in the personnel area should be implemented and continued in order to ensure that the Danish Armed Forces can recruit, train and retain
the necessary personnel, allowing for the fact that such initiatives must, at any time, be able to be
modified in response to current needs. Thus, it follows that the financing of these initiatives should
be prioritised in future defence budgets.

-  Regarding deployment periods, the Defence Commission finds that for the sake of two crucial
factors, the operational effect and personnel security, the Danish Armed Forces should continue the
development of the Army’s current flexible six-month model that includes opportunities for leave in
up to two periods. At the same time, the Danish Armed Forces should extend the flexible approach
to deployment periods so that opportunities for shorter periods of deployment are utilised when it is
prudent and appropriate both operationally and in terms of security.

-  Furthermore, the Defence Commission finds that a review of the Danish Armed Forces’ deployment
models should be carried out when the results of the Royal Danish Defence College’s comprehensive
study of these models are published in 2010.

-  The Defence Commission finds that the ability of the Danish Armed Forces to retain especially key
personnel must be improved, and the Commission finds therefore the initiatives planned in this
regard to be relevant.

-  The Defence Commission finds that making competencies visible can make a career in the Danish
Armed Forces more attractive, but also that it is a way of acknowledging the contributions that are
made by Danish defence personnel, for example in international missions. Furthermore, making
competencies visible can make it possible to identify civilian competencies that can be utilised in the
Danish Armed Forces, thus providing new recruiting opportunities.

-  The Defence Commission finds that the principle of formal civilian accreditation of Danish Armed Forces
education programmes should be expanded to include as many of the Danish defence programmes of

82


-----

education as possible. The future development of the Danish Armed Forces’ education programmes,
including in terms of increased modular development, should take place with this in mind.

The Defence Commission finds that as an extension of the efforts by the Danish Armed Forces’
education programmes to follow developments in the civilian education system to the greatest
possible extent, thus supporting the exchange and cooperation between the military and civilian
education systems, there should be an increased amount of coordination in the field of education
across the different ministries. Such a coordinated effort can, at the same time, support the efforts of
the Danish Armed Forces to draw attention to the level of accreditation and competence of Danish
Armed Forces education programmes vis-à-vis available civilian education programmes. This work
is aimed at recruiting and retaining Danish defence personnel as well as making clear the opportunities for establishing educational tracks that run by way of the Danish Armed Forces’ education
programmes and military service experience and leading to civilian programmes of education.

It is the assessment of the Defence Commission that an investigation should be conducted to determine whether it could be beneficial for the Danish Armed Forces to establish an education council.
The role of such a council must be to act as an advisory board in connection with creating and
developing Danish Armed Forces education programmes. The possible creation of an overriding
education council in the Danish Armed Forces must be seen in the context of and coordinated with
the “Personnel Professional Forum in the Danish Armed Forces” and the “Sub-Committee regarding Transition and Competence Development under Defence Command Denmark’s Central Joint
Consultation Committee”, which are both described in chapter 5.

The Defence Commission finds that structural post and further education programmes should be
implemented for reserve officers with the aim of providing reserve officers with the necessary
educational backgrounds in order for them to be able to take part in performing the tasks of the
Danish Armed Forces on various and relevant levels.

The Defence Commission finds it therefore relevant to seek to keep relevant groups of reserve

officers suitably active through occasional service in order to ensure that their specific useful
competencies are kept up to date.

The Defence Commission finds that an investigation should be conducted to determine to what
extent it is possible to enter into partnerships with civilian firms regarding, for example, the
periodic dispatching of technically trained or administrative employees in roles that, in principle,
do not require the employee to have a military background or to carry a weapon.

The Defence Commission finds that the Ministry of Defence should have an explicit policy on
veterans that supports defence employees and their families through a preventative effort so that
they are, to the greatest possible extent, prepared for deployment in international operations and
for the period after returning home.


-----

The Defence Commission finds that an investigation should be conducted to determine whether
Denmark, by providing support to veterans, could assist soldiers who have been deployed in
embarking on a civilian education programme or in finding a job in civil society after the risk-filled
contributions they have made on behalf of Denmark.

The Defence Commission finds that, in light of the expected continued high intensity of international operations, initiatives targeting veterans are important and should be continued and
further developed in cooperation with both professional organisations as well as other charitable
foundations such as the “Blue Berets” (“De Blå Baretter”).

The Defence Commission finds that there is an increased need for Denmark, by way of a comprehensively oriented effort, to focus on the prompt, relevant, coordinated and respectful care for those
injured in international service and their families.

The Defence Commission finds that the country should seek to designate, out of the various
rehabilitation centres in Denmark, some that specialise specifically in patients with the types of
injuries that employees of the Danish Armed Forces can typically sustain in international operations
and which have thus achieved a special level of expertise in this field.

The Defence Commission finds that the results of the project involving the short-term employment
of soldiers just returned from international operations should be followed closely, as it is directly
deemed to constitute a beneficial supplement to the initiatives already in progress aimed at easing
the readjustment of soldiers upon their return from international operations.

The Defence Commission finds that the entire area concerning pay-related allowances should be
further analysed in the upcoming agreement period, especially for the purpose of considering the
distribution of the total funds for pay supplements between deployed personnel groups in relation
to, among other things, their deployment conditions and their family provider responsibilities.

The Defence Commission finds that Danish Armed Forces Day and the special inspiration days
for women are useful in terms of recruitment and providing general information about the Danish
Armed Forces to young women.

The Defence Commission finds that Danish defence must continue to adapt its recruitment strategy
to the needs of the Danish Armed Forces. In this context, it must be taken into account that life-long
employment in the public sector does not necessarily meet the needs of the Danish Armed Forces
and is seen as even less attractive to young people. The recruitment strategy must therefore reflect
the fact that a career in the military is compatible with the desire to have a civilian career later in life
– as well as the other way around.

The Defence Commission finds that the initiatives underway aimed at improving the general health
of Danish Armed Forces employees should be continued.

-  The Defence Commission finds that the efforts towards receiving accreditation for Danish Armed Forces
education programmes should, in the future, be more closely linked with military competencies.

**The Danish Armed Forces – resources**

-  The Defence Commission finds that the determination of the budgetary framework for the Danish
defence forces in the light of the stated needs and the final overall prioritisation of resources within
this framework must take place in connection with a new political agreement being reached
concerning the Danish Defence Agreement for 2010-2014.

-  The Defence Commission finds that, in the short-term, the necessary linkage should be created
between tasks and resources. In order to restore this balance, a range of initiatives and modifications
are recommended within the areas of equipment, personnel and military establishments.

-  The Defence Commission finds that the necessary resources should be allocated for the operation and
maintenance of Danish Armed Forces equipment.

-  The Defence Commission finds that resources should be allocated for replenishing the Danish Armed
Forces’ stock levels.

-  The Defence Commission finds that resources should be allocated for purchasing training equipment.

-  Defence Command Denmark has estimated that an average annual investment level of approx. DKK 3
billion for major equipment investments during the period 2010-2014 will make possible the ongoing
reconstitution of the Danish Armed Forces’ existing capabilities. This level of investment will not,
however, allow for the possibility of acquiring possible new capabilities. On this basis, the Defence
Commission finds that, in the longer-term, raising the level of equipment investment can be considered
if there is a desire for acquiring new capabilities at the same time as maintaining existing capabilities.

-  The Defence Commission finds that an annual amount of DKK 14 million should be earmarked for
new initiatives aimed at supporting deployed personnel with parental responsibilities.

-  The Defence Commission finds that the implementation of the initiatives concerning personnel
should be prioritised so that an appropriate build-up of the Danish defence personnel structure
occurs and that the continuation of the existing initiatives and the implementation of new initiatives
should be considered in relation to the current economic situation and the expected developments in
the manpower situation.

-  The Defence Commission finds that resources should be allocated for alleviating structural bottlenecks through structural expansion and increasing the number of staff positions within specific areas.

The Defence Commission finds that the Danish Armed Forces’ military infrastructure and defence
estates area should be strengthened.

The Defence Commission has noted the fact that the basis for Defence Command Denmark’s
evaluation of additional needs within the area of military infrastructure and defence estates is
predicated on receiving a number of dispensations from environmental regulations for shooting
ranges, training grounds, etc.

The Defence Commission finds that all net additional expenditures related to the Danish Armed
Forces’ international engagement, including expenses related to losses and write-offs, etc. should
be made visible in connection with the report on the net additional expenses that are covered, as a
rule, under Section 35 of the Danish Finance and Appropriations Act.

The Defence Commission finds that there is a need for strengthening and expanding not only the
Danish Armed Forces’ capacity but the entire Danish Government’s capacity to conduct stabilisation, reconstruction and development projects in areas of conflict. In this context, a coordinating
body within the central administration should be established in order to ensure the integration of
the military and civilian aspects of the effort in a comprehensive strategy when forces are deployed
in international operations. Finally, consideration should be given to establishing a model for the
administration of funds to broader stabilisation efforts, including coordination initiatives that can
contribute to such integration.

The Defence Commission finds that the Danish Armed Forces should be compensated for the actual
expenses involved in the destruction of cluster munitions. The Defence Commission has noted
that Denmark’s commitment to destroying this type of ordnance does not necessarily require the
destruction to be completed within an upcoming defence agreement period. It is assumed therefore
that the expenses are to be defrayed until beyond the upcoming defence agreement period.

The Defence Commission finds that the reductions in and discontinuations of Armed Forces capabilities that are mentioned in chapter 7 will lead to significant savings. The precise amount of the total
savings in connection with capability reductions and discontinuations will obviously depend on
which specific reductions and discontinuations are decided on as a part of reaching a new five-year
agreement for the Danish Armed Forces.

The Defence Commission finds that, in the short-term, it must be ensured that resources allocated
to the Danish Armed Forces are utilised optimally for performing core tasks. This must be accomplished through an ongoing effort to minimise costs through continued efficiency improvement
and rationalisation as well as through a process of continual monitoring of Danish Armed Forces’
resource utilisation in order thus to create the basis for distributing resources optimally in relation
to the current needs.

##### Minority Statement by the Red-Green Alliance’s Member of the Danish Defence Commission, Member of the Folketing Frank Aaen

The Red-Green Alliance is unable to support the majority in the Danish Defence Commission.

The majority in the Danish Defence Commission wishes to continue the so-called pro-active defence and
foreign policy that Denmark has pursued in recent years; a policy that has drawn Denmark into two major,
disastrous wars in Iraq and Afghanistan. In particular, the discussion regarding the procurement of new
bomber aircraft, suitable for wars of aggression, and other heavy equipment confirms this line of approach.

In general, a shift has occurred in which security policy has become increasingly synonymous with bombs
and war. It is the Red-Green Alliance’s view that this has not led to greater security, but rather the contrary.

The Red-Green Alliance desires a fundamental change in Danish defence and security policy.

Instead of structuring the Danish Armed Forces to enable them to participate in new wars together with
the USA and NATO, the Red-Green Alliance wishes to see a shift in Denmark’s defence and security
policy towards negotiation, political solutions, democracy and development. And instead of a focus on
building military coalitions of the willing spear-headed by the USA, the UN should have a stronger role.
Denmark can contribute to this realisation.

_It is the Red-Green Alliance’s view that Denmark could make a difference:_

-  By contributing to political solutions on some of the critical global conflicts, peace in the Middle
East, resolution of conflicts in Africa, etc. Danish resources could make a difference here in the form
of development aid, military involvement in peacekeeping operations, and promoting negotiations
to find political solutions, where a small, independent nation has opportunities that a great power
with its own political agenda does not.

-  By using resources to support civil society and strengthen popular movements, labour unions,
democratic organisations, women’s and environmental organisations, youth organisations, etc., and
in so doing help build democracy from below.

-  By fighting injustice manifested in the form of poverty and lack of human rights and giving poor
and oppressed people the hope of a future characterised by social and democratic progress.

_Instead of focusing on procuring expensive military equipment and training the armed forces to participate in new_
_“Iraq” wars, Denmark should use resources on equipment that is suitable for:_

-  Participation in peacekeeping operations

-  Rapid assistance in response to humanitarian disasters

-  Efforts aimed at promoting local conflict resolution and mediation between conflicting parties

-  Build-up of regional security organisations.
