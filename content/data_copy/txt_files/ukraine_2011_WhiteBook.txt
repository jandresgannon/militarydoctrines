##### OPENING ADDRESS OF THE MINISTER OF DEFENCE OF UKRAINE

Reaffirming the commitment to democracy, civilian control of the Armed Forces of
Ukraine and appreciating the effectiveness of such a mechanism to inform the public,
the Ministry of Defence of Ukraine is publishing the seventh edition of White Book
_2011: Armed Forces of Ukraine._
The Armed Forces of Ukraine has turned 20 years old. A diffi cult path of recovery
and development has been traversed owing to the understanding and support of
the state’s top offi cials who managed to create the Armed Forces who are capable
of ensuring the territorial integrity and inviolability of Ukraine. The Armed Forces
continually improve their professional skills, maintain the best military traditions, and
show their deep patriotic sentiment and dedication to serve their Motherland.
2011 has seen the completion of the second State Programme, which regulated the
development of the Armed Forces of Ukraine within the past six years. The last stage of
its implementation fi nally exposed some positive trends during the year 2010 towards
solving the challenges of the Armed Forces.
A steady dynamism in the growth of military units’ (ships) training has been ensured.
With the support of the Government, the Programme baseline for the production of
materiel and equipment, which are of a paramount importance for Ukraine’s defence
capacity, have been designed. They include a multifunctional missile system, the
ship class “corvette”, and military transport aircraft An-70. The measures taken have
increased the materiel serviceability level, and have initiated the re-equipping of the
Armed Forces with domestically modernised items.
The Armed Forces of Ukraine were continuing its release from non-core functions.
The quantity of rocket fuel components, missiles and ammunitions disposed of grew.
State enterprises of the Ministry of Defence of Ukraine and other structures not
involved in the training of the Armed Forces to fulfi ll the tasks of defence, have been
placed under the control of the main central executive bodies.
Prudent personnel policy aimed at preserving skilled and highly professional staff,
solving social issues and achieving an appropriate level of social standards for military
personnel, their families and military pensioners, is and will remain our priority.


-----

At the same time, the new approaches and decisions by the state authorities in the
sphere of national Security and Defence, determined by Ukraine’s Non-Block status,
necessitate further adjustment to the structure of the Armed Forces of Ukraine, to
increase their readiness to perform assigned tasks.
The Ministry of Defence of Ukraine has developed a number of fundamental
statutory legal acts to regulate the present development strategy of the state Security
and Defence sector and a prospective model of the Armed Forces of Ukraine.
There is every reason to create an effective State Comprehensive Programme of
the Armed Forces of Ukraine reform and development for 2012-2017. With a properly
resourced Programme, the Armed Forces of Ukraine will be a modern powerful and
professional force.

#### SUMMARY OF THE ARMED FORCES OF UKRAINE DEVELOPMENT FOR THE PERIOD 2006-2011

n 2011 the activity of the Armed Forces was aimed at the increase of units’ combat readiness by means of
### Itechnical renovation of military equipment and armaments, acceleration of its modernisation, assurance
of rights and social guarantees for military personnel and members of their families.
The activity of the Ministry of Defence and the General Staff was focused on further optimisation of
the structure and the number of military command and control bodies, and preparation of legislative and
resourcing foundations of the Armed Forces modernisation.

IMPLEMENTATION The State Programme of the Armed Forces of Ukraine Development for 2006-2011
OF THE STATE (The State Programme) was accomplished in 2011. The Armed Forces’ development
PROGRAMME in the framework of the State Programme was financed by the amount of UAH
OF THE ARMED 55.5 billion (75.6% of the planned budget), that enabled its implementation in full
FORCES OF UKRAINE (Diagram 1.1).
DEVELOPMENT: Overall, during the period 2006-2011 the Armed Forces’ structure was improved, the
SUMMARY strength was reduced, the Land Forces’ Rapid Reaction Corps was formed, the military

education system, personnel and medical systems were reformed, and an international
military cooperation sphere was extended. The results of the State Programme
implementation are shown in Table 1.1.

**Diagram 1.1. The state of financial support of the State Programme** As the State Programme results show, Ukraine

At the same time, the expenditure structure of the
Ministry of Defence in 2011 showed the critical situation
of the Armed Forces funding (Diagram 1.3).

he determining factors of the Armed Forces combat effectiveness are technical readiness of materiel,
### Tplanned equipment of troops (forces) with new and advanced items, and a developed system of
technical support and professional personnel.
Considering the relevance of these issues for the Armed Forces, 2011 was declared the Year of the
technical readiness of materiel and the training of professional non-commissioned officers.


TECHNICAL
READINESS OF
MATERIEL – THE
BASIS OF TROOPS
(FORCES) COMBAT
EFFECTIVENESS


The problems of technical readiness of materiel, which had accumulated over several
years, can not be solved by a fragmentary solution; therefore the improvement
of military-technical policy was initiated with the formation of key programme
documents.

Supply of materiel

The Government has reviewed the conceptual documents of materiel development of
the Armed Forces for the long term, and adopted the programme to create a multifunctional missile system and the construction of ship class “Corvette” for the Naval
Force[1]. The solemn naming ceremony of the first ship “Volodymyr Velykyj” was
conducted with the participation of the President of
Ukraine on 17 May 2011.
During the year, a number of decisions aimed at the
improvement of the mechanisms of materiel support
were introduced; in particular:

               - the authorities between the Ministry of Defence and
the General Staff concerning the development and
manufacture of materiel were divided;

             - defence products’ quality control procedures
performed according to the defence order were
improved[2];

              - the powers of the general designer of equipment
for defence needs and the security of the state were
enlarged[3];

              - the general procedure of the organisation of works on the development
(modernisation) of materiel and the passing into service of the Armed Forces
new items of materiel (delivery, operation) was determined, and the functions
and powers of the main participants of the development (modernisation) process
of this materiel were defined.
In 2011 the financial resources allocated for the implementation of activities of
the materiel development were 2.2 times greater than in 2010 for procurement and
modernisation and 3.4 times greater for the renewal of combat readiness and materiel
repair.
The following priorities of funding were defined in order to make the most efficient
use of funds:

                - the renewal of operational status and maintenance of technical availability of
aviation, guided air-to-air and surface-to-air missiles;

              - the completion of research and development works already started on the
development and modernisation of materiel, conduction of state testing and
passing into service new (updated) items of materiel;

               - the procurement of individual items of materiel of foreign manufacture, the
production of which in Ukraine is economically inefficient.
Throughout the year 15 new items of materiel were brought into service.
Active work on the extension of the training facility inventory of the Armed Forces
continued. The comprehensive pilot simulator of the L39 “TDK-L39” aircraft which
will allow pilots to maintain their flying skills both

Renewal of the technical materiel readiness

The main efforts during the year were aimed at the renewal of the operational
status and maintenance of the technical availability of the key items of materiel;
primarily the materiel of aviation, air defence, ships, reconnaissance, electronic
warfare, communications and automation, missiles and ammunition, including guided
weapons, military units of the Joint Rapid Reaction Forces and those involved in the
participation of peacekeeping operations.
In addition, the functions of the Ministry of Defence were specified to ensure
operational status, technical availability and modernisation of the materiel of foreign
manufacture, which are in operational service with the Armed Forces.
The organisation of maintenance support was improved, in particular “maintenance
week” was introduced into the Armed Forces and the standards of practical works on
maintenance and renewal of materiel during these weeks were carried out[4].

[4] Chief of the General Staff – Commander-in-Chief of the Armed Forces of Ukraine Order # 110: “On the enactment of the Instruction on organisation and
conduct of maintenance week ever quarter in the Armed Forces of Ukraine” as of 15 July 2010.

The decline of technical readiness of materiel level
was halted in 2011.
During the year more than 8,100 items of materiel
were renewed, in particular:

                                         - the technical readiness of 5 ships was ensured
(command ship “Slavutych”, missile corvette
“Prydniprovya”, anti-submarine corvette “Ternopil”,
medium landing ship “Kirovograd”, rescue tug boat
“Kremenec”);

                                - the operational status of 62 aircraft and 10 helicopters
was restored;

                                         - **331 items of radio-technical troops materiel,** **34**
items of anti-aircraft missile troops materiel, and **20**
items of armour materiel were repaired.
In addition technical work was started to extend the life and availability of tactical
and anti-aircraft guided missiles of the Land Force. The repair of the submarine
“Zaporizhzhia” continued.

Disposal of rockets, ammunition and propellants

The disposal of surplus and unserviceable materiel stocks, ammunition and
equipment is an important component of the process of ensuring the safe operation
and maintenance of arms materiel and observance of environmental protection rules.
In 2011 the volume of disposal of rockets and ammunition unsuitable for further
usage and storage was increased twofold within the framework of the first stage
of implementation of the State Defence Programme of Disposal of Conventional
Ammunition Unsuitable for further Usage and Storage for 2008-2017 (State Disposal
Programme). At the same time the planned targets were not achieved.
The actual budget allocation for the implementation of the State Disposal Programme
was UAH 119.4 million (20% of the baseline requirement), and comprised General
Fund – UAH 96.4 million and Special Fund – UAH 23.0 million.
During the year 45,800 tons were withdrawn from military units of the Armed
Forces, and 44,500 tons of ammunition were disposed of: equating to 54.2% of the
planned volume for 2011 (82,100 tons) (Table 2.1.).

The summary of the State Disposal Programme implementation between 2008-2011
shows the limited provision of finance and resources to undertake ammunition disposal.
The total underfunding of the Programme amounts to more than UAH 700 million.
The consequence of this is the twofold reduction of the planned pace of ammunition
disposal.
The implementation of the State Target Programme of Disposal of Liquid Rocket
Fuel Components for 2010-2014 continued during 2011, according to which it plans to

During the year under the framework of the international contract on provision of
services connected with the disposal of mélange between the Ministry of Defence,
OSCE Secretariat and Russian closed joint-stock company “Technoazot”, federal state
enterprises “Sverdlov Plant” and “Biisk Oleum Plant” 3,186 tons of mélange were
disposed of (Table 2.2.). 2 propellant storage depots (Radehiv, Bila Cerkva) were
cleared of surplus rocket fuel components. In total, 6,569 tons of mélange was disposed
of in 2009-2011. The International contract was extended to 2012 in June 2011[5].

PROFESSIONAL NONCOMMISSIONED
OFFICERS – THE
MAIN FEATURE OF
THE MODERN ARMED
FORCES


2011 was the year of the Concept of Professional NCO development in the Armed
Forces[6] (the Concept of Professional NCO development). The aim of the Concept is
to provide a cadre of professional NCOs, who are able to shoulder the burden of the
education and training of subordinate personnel and thus become the foundations of
the professional Armed Forces.

Creation and development of the professional NCOs

The following actions were taken to implement the second stage of the Concept of
NCOs’ development:

  - the first NCOs’ all-Armed Forces meetings were held, in the course of which the
protocol and address to all Armed Forces NCOs were determined and the Code
of the Armed Forces NCOs[7] was approved (Appendix 3);

  - the functions of command concerning personnel control, its training and
education, organisation of combat training were divided between tactical level
commanders and NCOs (Appendix 3);

  - the typical career algorithm of NCOs of the Armed Forces was put in place; this
defined the promotion procedures and training of contract service personnel, the
terms for promotion, how contracts are to be drawn up and the completion of
training (refresher training courses) required (Appendix 3)[8];

  - Army Corps senior POs’ positions were introduced within military authorities
and filled with trained personnel;

  - the ratio of NCOs to the total strength of troops was determined. The list of
specialties, staff-position categories and wage categories was introduced[9].
Thus, the Armed Forces of Ukraine have moved closer to the standards of the
leading armies of the World, by introducing professional manpower provision
(Figure 2.2);

  - the military professional skills contest “Universal Soldier” was held, and within
the all-Armed Forces contest “The Best NCO of the Armed Forces” was held.

**2011**


The result of this work was the increase
of status of the NCOs’ role and place within
the system of combat training, education and
training of subordinate personnel. This factor
facilitated team-building among Service
personnel, increased professionalism and
personal responsibility for the execution
of assigned duties, strengthened military
discipline and improved the quality of life and
health of each Serviceman (Figure 2.3).

**CAUSES OF DEATH**


Professional NCOs are developed by
the multilevel-training system and in 2011
ensured the provision of the necessary level
of knowledge and skills.
At the same time the work on its
improvement continued, in particular:

- the age requirement for applicants to apply
for studies at military colleges was increased
from 23 to 30 years for medium level training
with the education-qualification level of a
“Junior Specialist”. There was an additional

                   - the term of contract service was decreased from two to one year prior to the
appointment to the basic level of NCOs’ training[11]; this training was introduced
at special brigades (regiments) with the mobile instructional teams from training
military units (centres)[12]. This enabled the training of 2.7 times more NCOs at
the basic level compared to 2010.
Due to the activities implemented, the NCOs training system in the Armed Forces
has moved significantly closer to the international standards of the leading armies of
the World. The comparison of NCOs’ training of the leading armies of the World and
adjacent states to that in the Armed Forces of Ukraine is given in Table 2.3.

Approximately 3,700 contract NCOs were trained during the year (Figure 2.4); this
significantly exceeded the previous year’s number and fully met the Armed Forces’
requirement by specialties according to the State Request programme.
According to the results of the work the negative trend in the creation and
development of professional NCOs’ cadre was overcome. The manning rate increased
at the end of 2011 and was almost at 77% of capacity (Figure 2.5).

he priorities of the development of the Armed Forces’ Command and Control system in 2011 were:
### Timprovement to its reliability and mobility; and adaptation of analog and digital command and control
means to any operational conditions. The main focus was given to the operational efficiency of troops
(forces).


IMPROVEMENT OF
THE COMMAND AND
CONTROL SYSTEM
OF THE ARMED
FORCES


During 2011, the restructuring and refinement of the functional tasks of command
and control bodies, redistribution of the infrastructure of the command and control
points’ system and the introduction of new automated command and control systems
and communication means continued.
At the end of 2011 the structure of the command and control of the Armed Forces
included (Figure 3.1):

   - _Strategic level – the Ministry of Defence, the General Staff, Armaments,_
Logistics, and the Main Directorate of Operational Support;

   - _Operational and Strategic level – the Services’ Commands;_

   - _Operational level – the Army Corps’ Commands, Air Commands, Maritime_
Operations Centre, Coast Defence Centre, Maritime Operational Commands,
and Territorial Directorate “North”;

   - _Tactical level – Task Force (Group), Brigades and Regiments’ Commands._

The Command and Control system has changed at the operational level; in particular, the Joint Operational Command was disbanded. In this regard the functions of operational planning of employment of combined arms troops (forces) formations, supervising them during operations, combat actions and activities in response to emergencies in
peacetime were placed on the General Staff and Land Forces Command.
Development of a Single Automated Command and Control System (SAC[2]S) continued during 2011. To ensure the overall coordination of all research areas in SAC[2]S’
creation, the authority of project manager was granted to the Chief of General Staff Commander-in-Chief of the Armed Forces of Ukraine. The development of the State
target programme of creation SAC[2]S was initiated.
A Coordinating Council on SAC[2]S was formed as a permanent advisory body to
the project manager, to determine the main directions of development and priorities of
funding of SAC[2]S.
During the year:

               - the information-analytical support systems of defence planning and mobilisation
deployment planning were upgraded;

              - hardware and software sets of the “Dnipro” Automated Command and Control
System of the Armed Forces’ routine activities were adopted;

             - a prototype system of an automated radio-technical support system was
developed and deployed, and a software and hardware filter for data exchange
on air situation was produced;

              - scheduled activities to create an Automated Command and Control System for
the Naval Forces, Rocket troops and Artillery and Air Defence of the Land forces
continued;

               - the development of a technical project and production of a prototype model of
an Automated Command and Control System for a separate mechanized brigade
in the brigade-battalion chain was started;

               - digital connectivity to the Single Digital Integrated Network of 15 information
and telecommunication centres was created;

               - 204 km of fibre optic cables were laid.
Despite the impetus of modernisation of the Armed Forces with new digital
communication systems and the expansion of telecommunications networks, this does
not meet the needs of the troops (forces). At the end of 2011 most of the technical
communications are analog, and the digital communications element accounts for less
than 10% of the whole communications system.

Strategic Level of Command

The second stage of the administrative reform was conducted and an appropriate
level of effectiveness of the Defence Ministry and the General Staff was provided. A
clear distribution of powers and responsibilities between the Ministry of Defence and
General Staff was established[1].
The manpower establishment strength of service and military personnel of the
Ministry of Defence was reduced by 30% from 1,100 personnel to 770[2].
The structure of the organisation was specified, and the number of structural units
was reduced in the Ministry of Defence, including:

               - government bodies of state administration which were created at the expense
of the strength of the Ministry of Defence were eliminated[3]. The functions and
tasks of the State Department of Retired Service personnel Resettlement, and
conversion of former military facilities were transferred to the Ministry of
Social Policy of Ukraine[4], and where responsibility remained in the Ministry of
Defence – to personnel policy and social and humanitarian policy departments.
The authority of the Department of State for surplus property and land was
transferred to the Accounting centre for surplus and discarded property of the
Armed Forces;

               - a level of efficiency of supervisory activity over executive discipline was
increased. The authority of Supervision administration was transferred to the
Administrative Department;

                - the command and control of forces and means of civil protection of the Armed
Forces was simplified. The Department for Civil Protection and Environmental
Safety was disbanded, and the functions and tasks of the department were
adopted by the Main Directorate of Operational Support;

                 - structural units were reorganised after clarification of their responsibilities. The
Directorate of Organisational and Analytical Support of the Minister of Defence
(patronage service) was reformed into the Service of the Minister of Defence of

The system of military medical support at operational and tactical levels was
improved. The Central Military Medical Directorate, which is directly subordinated to
the General Staff was created.
The structure of the Ministry of Defence and the General Staff as at the end of 2011
is given in Annex 4.

Operational and Strategic level of Command

The Operational and Strategic level of Command has not been significantly changed.
The main efforts were aimed at separation of the administrative and operational
command and control functions, elimination of duplication of tasks and functions of
military command and control, and optimisation of the organisational structure in the
Armed Services of the Armed Forces.

Command and control of peacekeeping contingents and personnel

During 2011 the system of command and control of the Armed Forces peacekeeping
contingents was changed.
From the beginning of the year the general command
and control of peacekeeping contingents and personnel
of the Armed Forces was carried out by the General Staff
through the Main Directorate of Military Cooperation
and Peacekeeping Operations. Commands of the Armed
Services of the Armed Forces conducted direct control
and coordination of their employment. The organisation
of command and control of peacekeeping contingents and
personnel of the Armed Forces of Ukraine is shown in
Figure 3.2.
The system of command and control of peacekeeping
contingents and personnel has acquired a three-stage
level:

                - strategic level – the General Staff;

             - operational level – the Commands of the Armed
Services of the Armed Forces;

               - tactical level – the HQ of a peacekeeping contingent.

After the Parliament passed the Laws of Ukraine of «The Armed Forces of Ukraine’s
Strength for 2011» and «The Armed Forces of Ukraine’s Strength for 2012»[7] the
Armed Forces has returned to legal framework.
At the end of 2011 the strength of the Armed Forces was 192,000 personnel, including 144,000 military personnel. The downsizing of the strength was recommenced after
a long break, was carried out within the terms set by the legislation of Ukraine. In total,
8,000 appointments were cut, including 6,000 military posts (Appendix 4).
Creation of the Special Operations Forces continued in 2011 in order to increase the
capabilities of the Armed Forces to perform tasks of reconnaissance and intelligence,
rapid response to asymmetrical threats and unconventional warfare methods.
During the year work to create the conditions for the deployment of a military unit
in the town of Bolgrad were ongoing in the Land Forces. The Military Academy in the
city of Odesa was created to improve the training of some specialists.

he main objectives of the training system in 2011 were to: gain an increased level of military skills,
### Twhilst considering the future organisational structure of the Armed Forces of Ukraine; and to take
immediate measures for the gradual development of the combat readiness of the forces.
The main efforts of the Forces’ training:

           - harmonisation and combination of the force training system for the units manned with both
conscripts and contract personnel;

            - establishment of the operational and tactical educational environment taking into consideration
the future organisational structure of the Armed Forces;

            - acquiring an adequate level of training and interoperability of national units with the military
organisations of the EU.


FORCES’ TRAINING
SUPPORT


The implementation of the Concept of Training of the Armed Forces (2010) continued
during 2011. Further development of the concept for forces’ tactical training resulted
in the reduction of the number of regulatory documents [1] and identified the main
methods for coordinating combat and professional training.[2]

A unified approach was established to define the qualitative indicators in the
evaluation procedure of the force training system[3]. The results of continuous monitoring
over the outcomes of military training led to the establishment of a unified procedure for
the evaluation of the force training activities and the definition of the list of standards
for the training of mechanized and armored units.[4]

The year was marked by the highest level of actual to
planned financing to underpin the force training during
the last five years; this was made possible due to:

              - the coordination of tasks of the Armed Forces, as
provided by the National Officials, and real financial
capability;

               - accurate planning of the training activities, timely
clarification of the training plans and their adaptation
to the financial allocation, as provided by the State
Budget of Ukraine, on part of the General Staff.
The training of military units comprising JRRF was
underpinned by 82.7% of the planned budget, which
included 75.3% of the guaranteed budget from the
General Fund (Table 4.1).

RESULTS OF FORCES’
TRAINING PLANS


The priority in allocating resources was given to the units comprising JRRF. It
resulted in them receiving 7.2 times greater financial support in comparison to the
Main Defence Forces, thus ensuring full scale combat training of the troops and forces
comprising Immediate Reaction Forces and the Air Defence Duty Forces.

The confirmation of a capability of a command and control body to control the activity
of the subordinated forces during training and in operations (combat activity) under
the present organisational structure of the forces was the main outcome of 2011.
The implementation of a common operational and strategic training environment
for military exercises enabled a common approach to the organisation of control over
forces and services interoperability. The military exercise of the territorial defence
forces “Spryiannia-2011”, that joined 27 areas of territorial defence was conducted
successfully, was a good example of this. The Lvivska, Chernivetska, Chernigivska and
Odeska regions became the locations for the practical part of the exercises.
Those activities allowed the development of theoretical knowledge and practical
skills of generals, admirals and officers; provided the coordination of the military
command and control bodies; and facilitated the cooperation with other military
organisations and law-enforcement bodies.
The frequency of the combat training of the forces throughout the year increased
by 1.1-1.3 times. In particular, the total amount of combat training as compared to
2010 increased by 30%: company tactical exercises – by 2.5 times (Table 4.2), platoon
shooting exercises – by 3 times, shooting exercises for squads – by 3.5 times.

The Land Forces completed all the planned tactical exercises (with live firing) with
companies (19) and battalions (5), plans and programmes on small arms shooting and
air-to-surface target practice (66) for Land Force aviation units. A positive trend of
increasing the average flight time per crew was achieved.
However due to problems with the resourcing provision, the results of the force
training plans and programmes for drivers were below 11-30%.
The Air Force increased the frequency of air missile launches by almost 30%.
Average flight time per crew for the JRRF units increased by 7% compared to 2010.
Aviation units had over 350 flight shifts with the total flight time of approximately
4,000 hours.
The AD units performed live firing with anti-aircraft
missile systems. Once maintenance repair had been
undertaken, the anti-aircraft missile system S-300 PS was
assessed and evaluated after the live-firing of missiles.
Whilst on combat duty, the AD units detected and
tracked over 480,000 air targets, as well as identifying
and preventing 22 violations of the airspace of the State
Border of Ukraine.
The Naval Forces completed all the planned ships
sea-training, and trained 27 ships and boats, 11 naval
aviation crews, and 7 tactical groups of ships to perform
their assigned missions. Successful diver training, with
the total time under the water, increased by 1.3 times.
The coastal defence troops trained a tactical battalion
group and provided twice as many firing exercises
for platoons and squads, compared to 2010, with the
frequency of training in the field increasing by 1.9 times.
MBT firing was increased by 1.5 times, APC (IFV) firing – by 1.7 times.
Total flight time in naval aviation was increased by 1.7 times, and a practice of
having a tactical flight training with squadrons continued. Average flight time for naval
aviation crew comprising JRRF was increased by 3 hours and 32 minutes, and crews
comprising MDF – almost by 10 hours.

Research command post exercise “Adequate Response - 2011”

The apogee of the force training was the practical component of the command post
exercise “Adequate Response 2011” (Figure 4.1). The purpose of this exercise was
to review the level of combat training of the forces as well as to research directions
of developing a prospective model of the Armed Forces of Ukraine.
Up to date approaches to the development of a command and control system of the
forces and their future organisational structure were tested during the exercise. The
likely situations that may require the operation of the Armed Forces were reproduced
for the first time. As a result the “South” and “West” operational commands were
established.
A total of 62 combat training activities on 13 military training areas were held.

**The results of the exercise proved the effectiveness of the command and control**
**system and its ability to function through the chain of command through the**
**General Staff – Operational Command (Immediate Reaction Corps) – Brigade.**
**The prospective combat strength of the Armed Forces was generated and the new**
**approaches to its application were tested on practice.**

###### CHAPTER 5

#### PERSONNEL POLICY IN THE ARMED FORCES

he availability of professionally trained staff with high moral values and professional qualities, who are
### Tmotivated and able to effectively solve complex military and professional task, is an important factor in
ensuring that the Armed Forces are capable of performing the allocated tasks.
The introduction of a new Centralised Personnel Management System has provided a comprehensive,
efficient, and cost effective support mechanism staffed by highly qualified personnel with high moral
values and professional qualities.


IMPLEMENTATION
OF THE PERSONNEL
POLICY PRINCIPLES:
SUMMARY


The second phase of the Personnel Policy Concept implementation in the Armed
Forces (Personnel Policy Concept) was completed in 2011. The implementation of
the Personnel Policy provided a guaranteed and qualitative manning of troops (forces)
with personnel able to perform the designated tasks.
The end of the second phase of the Personnel Policy Concept implementation was
marked by:

  - the creation of a Centralised Personnel Management System;

  - the introduction of a new system approaches to military personnel career
management;

  - the merging into a single comprehensive system of legal protection and
provision of social guarantees to Service personnel and their families, social
and professional resettlement for retirees, military patriotic education of youth
and the promotion of military service.

Improvement of the personnel management

The transfer of the functions and powers of the Ministry of Defence personnel
agencies under the nomenclature of the First Deputy Minister of Defence (over 5,000
officers positions and 3,000 positions of soldiers and contract service sergeants) to
the Human Resources Centre of the Armed Forces, and assigning it the status of
Management of the Armed Forces branch has completed the formation of the Officers’
Personnel Management System.
By the end of 2011 the Personnel Management System had acquired a structure
comprising four levels (Figure 5.1):

  - the Ministry of Defence (the Personnel Policy Department) has general oversight
of the system;

  - the General Staff (the Main Personnel Directorate, Human Resources Centre) is
directly responsible for managing the personnel agencies of the Armed Forces
of Ukraine;

  - the Personnel Directorate of the Armed Forces’ services and corresponding
Human Resources Centres, provide Personnel management on the 3 level;

  - the Personnel sections provide the personnel management in formations, units,
institutions and establishments.

The Human Resources Centre of the Armed Forces and the Human Resources
Centres of the Armed Forces’ branches as the main elements of the implemented system
and provide the functions and powers of manning positions and the career management
of of service personnel.

Functional management, Administrative management Career management,
legal and methodical support Personnel decisions

At the same time, a collegial principle in appointing troops to posts and a functional
principle in forming committees on candidates’ selection were implemented under the
personnel policy.
In order ersonnel drafting and decision-making processes were enhanced to increase
the effi ciency of personnel management. Recommendations on how to retain the best
military personnel in service were developed[1].
The results of the measures undertaken are as follows:

  - the fi lling of the number of command appointments at various levels (from
brigade commanders to platoon commanders) has been brought to 98%;

  - 100% of operational and strategic level training graduates and 98% of operational
and tactical level training graduates were appointed to positions requiring the
corresponding level of education. 99% of tactical level graduates were appointed
based on their acquired specialty;

  - the number of cadets entering higher military educational establishments was
increased by more than 450 people;

  - the number of reserve offi cers increased by more than 1.5 times; 437 people
brought into service.


Enlistment of Military Personnel by Contract


During the year the improvement of the Force Manning System with contract service
personnel continued, namely by:

                - introducing monitoring and timely fi lling of the databases with vacant military
contract positions. The introduction of modern technologies in personnel work,
and the software system “Contractor” in particular, provided effi ciency during
searching position vacancies throughout the Armed Forces;

Centres for Personnel Manning by Contract;

                - changing the priorities of personnel manning by contract for ranks and NCOs.
The priority manning of positions linked to combat readiness of the Armed
Forces was ensured. 4,600 people or 90% of the total enrolled on contract
military service basis were trained;

                - establishing cooperation with local authorities to provide effective support of
the Contract military service Recruitment Centre of the Armed Forces in the
recruitment of the Armed Forces;

During the year, measures to improve the quality of
military experts’ training and education were taken as
follows:

                                 - the training and education system (professional
development, re-training) of military personnel was
improved in accordance with specified tasks of the
Armed Forces, which resulted in the professional
development of approximately 2,700 service
personnel and 140 civil servants;

                                 - the qualification requirements for graduates of
higher military educational institutions and their
period of study, were reviewed after clarification by
the Cabinet of Ministers of Ukraine, the list of areas
and specialties of training;

                  - an integrated training system for military personnel who are to be sent to
foreign military educational institutions for obtaining operational-strategic and
operational-tactical levels of training. It includes the nomination of a serviceman
to the National Defence University of Ukraine to organise the provisioning, and
on return from abroad – coordinate the reporting on the training and obtain the
necessary knowledges according to individual training plans.
The State order for training and educating of military specialists for the Armed
Forces and other military formations has been accomplished. The higher military
educational institutions trained almost 1,300 officers.
The Military Scientific Council (Joint advisory agency) in the Ministry of Defence
was created to solve military-theoretical and military-technical support issues for the
development of modern weapons and military equipment; to determine the priority
directions for the development of military science; and to organise fundamental and
basic defence researches.
The work on the formation of powerful Educational Research Centres took place.
Under this, it is planned to create a Educational and Research Complex at a strategic
level, comprising the National Defence University, the Central Scientific Research
Institute of the Armed Forces and the Central Research Institute of Armaments and
Military Equipment. The Educational Research Centres of the Armed Forces are
forming within the Services’ higher military educational institutions.

military educational institutions in scientific researches was increased. The operation of
research laboratories is restored.
Language training of Armed Forces personnel was carried out in: 22 groups of
intensive English (including a group of military service personnel by contract); two
groups of German; and in one group of French. The selection for language students for
English, German and French courses was carried out twice a year.
During the year the total of trained language personnel is 655, including 578 military
and 77 civil servants of the Ministry of Defence, the General Staff and other central
executive bodies which are involved in national defence.

IMPLEMENTATION OF SOCIAL AND HUMANITARIAN POLICY IN THE ARMED FORCES


SOCIAL DIALOGUE
WITH CIVIL SOCIETY
INSTITUTES


The experience of the world’s leading armed forces shows that MOD’s cooperation
with Civil Society Institutes helps to perform more effectively the tasks in the
military sphere, in defence and military development sector and helps to provide the
democratic civil control over the Armed Forces.

Patronage over the Armed Forces


The tradition of the patronage over the Armed Forces[3] in 2011 was continued and
developed. Patronage relations were structured, patrons’ cooperation – of executive
power and local self-governmental bodies – with patronized army units, was
organised[4].
The systemic nature of work ensured inclusion of all the services of the Armed
Forces. At the end of 2011 patronage for over 260 army units was established
(Table 6.1.).

**Table 6.1. Patronized formations, army units,** During the year patronage support totalled more than
military establish ments, institutes and organisations 9 million UAH. The level of support from such cities
of the Armed Forces of Ukraine as Kyiv and Sevastopol, Zaporizhia and Chernigiv and

Sumy regions was the most significant.

**Functional subordination:** **Number**

The main patronage efforts were directed on:

youth, cultural-educational activity with service personnel and preparing the preconscription training of youth prior to fulfilling their military duties.

Improving cooperation with public society
institutes

The main form of MOD’s activity is establishing a
dialogue with the public by means of the consultative
body – Ukrainian MOD Public Council (Public

In order to create the appropriate conditions for the
implementation of the Pastoral care concept, roundtable meetings were held attended by all orthodox
diocese priests, who execute spiritual and patriotic care
in the Armed Forces and other military formations. In
December 2011 an All-Ukrainian scientific and practical
conference “Armed Forces and Ukrainian priesthood”
took place. As a result the mechanism of the cooperation
of the Armed Forces and religious organisations was
proposed (Figure 6.4).
Within the framework of the cooperation with foreign
chaplaincy services, the Armed Forces representatives
took part in the 53rd International military pilgrimage
to the town of Lurde (French Republic) and the 3rd AllUkrainian military pilgrimage to the Zarvanyts’ka icon
of Our Lady (village of Zavarnuts’a, Ternopil’ region). Chaplains and servicemen from
Germany, Polish and Slovak Republic also attended it.
Under guardianship of the Ukrainian Orthodox and Ukrainian Greek-Catholic
churches, servicemen had the opportunity to make a private pilgrimages to the Holy
Land.

SOCIAL PROTECTION
OF SERVICE
PERSONNEL


The salary level of the servicemen.

On 1st of June the Minister of Defence made the decision to raise salaries via the
raising of the monthly bonus: for contract-based privates, NCOs and Warrant Officers
this ranged from 70 to 125 % of their rank-based salaries; for officer personnel this
ranged from 55 to 90%. As result, the salary of contract-based personnel, sergeants
and Warrant Officers has increased by 19-24% and for officers by 11-14% (figure 6.5).

But the salary level of the servicemen is still low in
comparison with the average national salary in Ukraine.
For example for a 1[st] year contract-based serviceman
salary from June 1[st] 2011 is 1463 UAH. this is two times
below the national average salery in Ukraine[9] (figure
6.6). This does not encourage the citizens of Ukraine to
consider military service as a career.
However the current rate of salary increase for
servicemen of the Armed Forces is greater than that in
Ukrainian civil structures.

institutions should provide medical and sanatorium care
for the following categories of personnel: servicemen
of the Armed Forces, veterans of military service,
liquidators of the Chernobyl catastrophe, war veterans,
members of servicemen’s or service veterans’ families

Under the State guarantees for retiring servicemen, developments were made in social
and professional resettlement. This combines national interests and individuals’
requirements. Defence resettlement was integrated within the national resettlement
system.
As a result of the administrative reform of the central bodies of the executive branch,
the Ministry of Social Policy of Ukraine has become responsible for the resettlement
functions for retiring servicemen[14].
The tasks, functions and powers of the military administration bodies in resettlement
and retraining servicemen to civilian life were specified in MOD.
During this period, international projects financed by NATO, OSCE and the Ministry
of Foreign Affairs of the Kingdom of Norway were delivered.
2.400 servicemen and members of their families were taught civilian professions
on special professional courses within the framework of the international project and
programme (Annex 7).


**The main goal to sucsesfully achieve tasks on reforming our Armed Forses is:**
**to make military service a competitive and attractive option within the job market,**
**and strict abidance to the social guarantees of the servicemen and the members**
**of their families provided by the legislation. During the year, the MOD and the**
**General Staff used their resources effectively to create a positive image of the**

odernisation of the State policy on national security within the military and defence spheres and for
### Mmilitary structure issues, requires the strengthening of international cooperation. This will help to
prevent security threats arising, and will support the Armed Forces’ reforms and development process.
The main efforts of the Ministry of Defence and General Staff in 2011 were directed towards multilateral
cooperation within the framework of international and regional organisations, development of bilateral
relations with the Russian Federation, and performing the activities prescribed in the Ukraine/USA
strategic partnership Charter.

INTERNATIONAL In 2011 the Ministry of Defence fulfilled the international obligations of Ukraine on
COOPERATION crisis regulation and the practical implementation of the key objectives of State for
eign policy[1].
Thus, international cooperation was directed at:

                - working on Ukraine’s potential eligibility to integrate into the European Union
and participation in improvement and development of the European system of
collective security;

                - development of bilateral relations with the Russian Federation on the basis of
strategic partnership, friendship and neighbourhood, and mutually beneficial
cooperation;

                - fulfillment of the Ukraine/USA Charter activities, and forming mechanisms of
strategic partnership within effective and mutually beneficial cooperation;

               - supporting a dialogue with key partners of Ukraine, neighbouring countries,
other world leading countries and international security organisations;

                              - continuation of the constructive partnership with the

BILATERAL
COOPERATION


Bilateral cooperation with other nations’ Defence Ministries is a key method of
enhancing mutual trust and supports Ukraine’s implementation of the non-block
policy.

During the year 458 activities were conducted with Defence Ministries of 48
countries, primarily with the United States of America, the Russian Federation, the
United Kingdom, Germany, France, the Republic of Belarus, and the Republic of
Poland (figure 7.2).


**Figure 7.2. Bilateral cooperation with other nations’ MODs in 2011**


Productive results were achieved through the
cooperation of Ukraine with the USA. According the
Memorandum[2] (2009) in April 2011 there took place
disposal of rocket complexes 9К72 (Scud) and equipment, materials and rocket fuel components.

The reforms of the military education system of
Ukraine continued and 79 Ukrainian Armed Forces servicemen were trained in US educational institutions.
The negotiations on military-technical cooperation were
renewed and the USA experience in building military
housing was used by the Ministry of Defence.

An important factor in supporting a stable level of cooperation between the
Ukrainian and UK MODs is the wide involvement of the civilian UK Special Defence
Advisor. “Expert Classes” were introduced and there were internships of MOD and
Armed Forces representatives within the SDA office. With support of the UK MOD’s
defence diplomacy programme, the two-week course “Managing Defence in the Wider
Security Context” and one-week security workshop for security and defence sector
personnel and Armed Forces servicemen were delivered. The courses were delivered

forces.

For the third time within the framework of the joint Ukraine-Denmark operation
“Northern Falcon 2011”, Air Force Transportation Aviation teams successfully
completed tasks on transporting fuel and supplies in the Arctic from the US Air Force
base “Thule” to the Danish station “Nord”. During the three weeks of the operation,
there were 20 sorties, equating to almost 100 flying hours in the Arctic. In total more
than 600,000 litres of fuel and 17.5 tons of supplies were transported.

Between the MODs of Ukraine and Turkey a military-political dialogue at a high
level continues. The bilateral cooperation of regional security projects was activated;

Within Central and Eastern Asia the most dynamically developing area of defence
cooperation is that with the People’s Republic of China; the main focus being: militarypolitical consultations with MOD’s top level management; exchange of personnel
training; and implementation of burden-sharing projects for designing new armaments
and materiel.
Defence bilateral relations were further developed with the leading countries of
South America. For the first time in the history of bilateral relations within this region,
in September 2011 the Minister of Defence of Ukraine visited the Federal Republic of
Brazil. During discussions a great range of issues were covered; but primarily bilateral
military and military-technical cooperation.

In April 2011 the Technical Agreement to the
Memorandum (2010)[5] between the Ukrainian MOD, the
Turkish AF General Staff and Supreme Allied Command
Operations Staff was signed, for the creation and maintenance of the air situation data exchange system between
the Ukrainian Air Force Command Post “South” (Odesa,
Ukraine) and the Control and Notification Centre of the
Turkish Air Force (Erzurum, Turkey). Data exchange
between Ukraine and Turkey is scheduled to start in
2012.[6]

The cooperation with the NATO Maintenance and
Supplies Agency (NAMSA) continues for disposal of
surplus and unserviceable ammunition and armaments.
In 2011 the first stage of the Trust Fund Project within
the NATO “Partnership for Peace” programme was completed. During the period 2006-2011 15.000 tons of conventional ammunition, 400.000
tons of light armaments and small arms, and 1.000 rockets for mobile anti-aircraft-missile systems were destroyed[7] .
Taking into account the successful implementation of the NATO/PfP Trust Fund
stage 1 activities, in September 2011, the Cabinet of Ministers and NATO concluded the
agreement on the disposal of light armaments and small arms, conventional ammunition
and anti-personnel mines (PFM-1) and the second stage of the programme commenced[8].
Another example of practical cooperation with the Alliance is the Individual
Partnership Programme between Ukraine and NATO. During its implementation phase,
priority was given to servicemen in units and those Armed Forces units identified for
participation in international programmes, international military training, multinational
military formations and international peacekeeping operations. Under the Programme
more than 200 representatives of the Armed Forces took part in 70 activities.
The NATO run Professional Development Programme for security sector civilian
personnel continues and during 2011, 168 people were trained on a range of professional courses.

Сooperation with other international and regional
organisations and initiatives

The involvement and cooperation of Ukraine within the framework of international
and regional organisations and initiatives provides Ukraine with additional tools to
introduce its national interests and allows for the acceptance by other states that
Ukraine is a partner with equal rights on the international scene.
As a member of the UN for more than 19 years, Ukraine plays a role of a contributor
of military units and personnel for participation in peacekeeping operations for
international peace support and security.

Taking into account the urgent necessity by the international community to
develop effective measures of countering terrorism, Ukraine confirmed its readiness
to contribute its best efforts towards the common fight. Thus, once Security Council
Resolution No. 1991 was ratified at the 6568[th] meeting on June 28, 2011, a Ukrainian
peacekeeping contingent was sent to participate in the UN Stabilisation Mission to the
Democratic Republic of Congo (MONUSCO)[9].

Ukraine’s activity in the OSCE ensured equal participation of our country in the
consideration and management of key issues of international security, development and
activation of international cooperation in disarmament and the regulation of “frozen”
conflicts.

During 2011 the OSCE – Ukraine project on the disposal of liquid rocket fuel
(melange) in Ukraine continued[10]. A key element of cooperation has been to support
the resettlement of retiring service personnel to civilian life. Since 2008, under the
framework of the resettlement programme and assisted by the OSCE, more than 4,000
ex-servicemen have been retrained.

International cooperation within the Commonwealth of Independent States reached a
new level. A Ukrainian delegation participated on two occasions in the Commonwealth
of Independent States Defence Ministers’ Council (CIS DMC) meetings, including
at the 60[th] anniversary meeting. DMC is a statute body of the CIS and was formed to
provide effective multilateral military collaboration and integration.

In 2011 three steps were the basis of Ukraine’s collaborative work under the
framework of the CIS Military Cooperation Concept up to 2015, in particular:

                - there was an exchange of information on the problems associated with the CIS
united air defence system: development of its forces and facilities; organisation
and conduction of air defence units exercises with combat shooting;

                            - issues were discussed the future participation of
the Armed Forces units in CIS joint operational
exercises;

                           - the plans of multilateral military and militarytechnical cooperation were approved.

In order to deepen military cooperation within the
CIS, during April 2011, the meeting of the CIS DMC
Coordinating Committee on air defence issues met with
its members for the first time in Ukraine.

In an effort to further integrate into the European
Community, Ukraine fulfilled its obligations under the
framework of regional initiatives. In particular, in October
2011, a delegation of the Ministry of Defence participated
in the meeting of Defence Ministers of South-Eastern Europe in the Republic of Turkey
where Ukraine confirmed its readiness to continue the projects already underway and
to participate in regulating conflicts at the regional level; focusing first of all on the
so-called frozen conflicts.

Within the framework of the Vyshegrad Group discussions continued on the
establishment of an EU battle group. It was understood that the Republic of Poland
would chair the project and the BGs participating in operations and missions would be
at full operational readiness in the first half of 2016. In February 2011 Ukraine passed
the chairmanship of the “Tysa” multinational initiative to the Hungarian Republic.
In April and August 2011, two vessels of the Ukrainian Armed Forces Navy took
part in the activities of the Joint Group Black Sea Naval Cooperation BLACKSEAFOR.
In April the command and control ship “Slavutych” travelled over 1860 sea-miles, and
the crew conducted 25 ship exercises and 52 ship combat exercises. As a part of an
international formation the ship took part in tactical exercises and training. In August, the
sea mine-sweeper “Cherkasy” participated in search and rescue and humanitarian tasks.
**The good preparation by Ukraine presented a positive image at the**
**international level and contributed to the establishing of positive relations across**
**the neighbourhood at the regional level, providing proper protection of national**
**interests across the world and making a significant contribution to the European**
**security system.**


PEACEKEEPING
ACTIVITY


Participation by Ukraine in peacekeeping operations is an important part of the
country’s contribution to strengthening peace and security across the world. During
2011, approximately 960 servicemen of the Armed Forces took part in 11 peacekeeping
missions and operations in 8 different nations (Figure 7.4). 63 planned rotations of
the Ukrainian peacekeeping contingent and personnel were organised and conducted.
The general level of contribution by the Armed Forces in international efforts
on crisis regulation increased. Additionally, three military doctors were embedded
in the military hospital of the Polish contingent of the
International Security Assistance Forces in Afghanistan
(Ghazni province) and two military experts were
embedded with the Lithuanian Army Aviation Advisory
Panel to the Afghan National Army (Kandahar province).
Ukraine’s contribution to peacekeeping personnel in the
Islamic Republic of Afghanistan amounts to 22 people.
In addition, an additional three officers increased the size
of the Ukrainian peacekeeping contingent in the NATO
Training Mission in Iraq. On completion of this NATO
Training Mission, all Ukrainian personnel returned to
Ukraine.
In order to maintain the level of involvement of the
Armed Forces in peacekeeping operations under the UN
aegis and in as a result of the rebrigading of the UN
Missions in Sudan in July 2011, Ukrainian peacekeeping personnel were transferred
to the positions of co-operation and supervision officers in the newly established UN
Mission in the Republic of Southern Sudan and the UN Temporary Forces providing
security in Аbyei.
In 2011 the Armed Forces were involved in international operations and conducted
a humanitarian mission to evacuate Ukrainian and foreign citizens from the area of
combat activity on the territory of People’s Libyan Arab Jamahiriya by utilising the
large landing ship “Konstantin Olshansky” and the aircraft ІL-76MD[11]. Effective support to the UN operation in Côte d’Ivoire was provided by the 56[th] helicopter detached
unit of the UN Mission in Liberia.


11 Two trips of the airplane IL - 76 and the landing ship Konstantin Olshansky» evacuated 530 people; 378 were citizens of Ukraine and the other 152 citizens were
from 18 different countries.

ARMS
CONTROL


Taking into account the fact that the European community shows a strong interest in
the development of verification of arms control in Europe and regional measurement,
Ukraine fully ensures compliance with international obligations within this sphere.
2011 was characterised by a high level of activity by all states to undertake arms
control measures under international treaties. There was an active negotiation process to
amend elements of the treaties for the control of conventional arms on a regional basis,
including the Agreement of ordinary forces in Europe[13].
In 2011 on the territory of Ukraine, 56 control activities were conducted
(Figure 7.5).
Ukraine also conducted 52 control activities on the territory of other states. The
number of control activities in 2011 remained at approximately the same level as the
last year (Figure 7.6).

Another format of verification activity is the preparation and distribution of annual
information on defence issues in accordance with the Vienna document of 1999,
the Treaty on Conventional Armed Forces in Europe and the Document of global
exchange of military information. The main outcome of this work resulted in Ukraine
honouring its commitments to provide the OSCE states with these documents, such as
the Annual exchange of military information, Global exchange of military information
and Planning in the field of defence. In total more than 200 formats of reports were
provided by Ukraine. During the same period, Ukraine obtained and worked through
over 2,500 formats of reports from other participant states.
