## INTRODUCTION

The National Security Strategy of the Republic of Albania is a document of national
character; it is based on the Constitution of the Republic of Albania; it reflects the
development of state policies for the security of citizens, the society and Albanian
democratic state against external and internal risks and threats.

The legislation and activity in the field of security of the Republic of Albania conforms to
the standards and principles of a democratic state, in compliance with the international
acts.

The security of the country is guaranteed by effectively accomplishing the national
interests in a timely and effective manner.

The fundamental missions of the National Security Strategy of the Republic of Albania
are:

-  The exercise of sovereignty of the Republic of Albania;

-  Protection of independence and territorial integrity;

-  Protection of life and property;

-  Constant democratic development and economical prosperity;

-  Protection of national values and dignity;

-  Membership in international structures of security;

The state interests require the protection of the constitution, sovereignty and territorial
integrity of the country, perfection of democracy and strengthening of the rule of law,
the protection of life and private property of citizens and development of free market
economy, to ensure prosperity and national security.

Protection, ideals, and development of the national identity, are considered of crucial
importance for the perspective of Albania. The public education and the protection of
historical, cultural, moral and spiritual values enhance the dignity of the nation. Albania
protects and respects by law the individual freedom and human rights.

The Republic of Albania aspires to be a factor of stability and peace in the region and
shows no hostility or territorial claim about borders change by use of force.
Albania is declared against creation of crises and regional conflicts and against solving
them by means of violence.

Integration in compliance with the international structures of collective security
constitutes to be the best way for further strengthening of security of the country, aiming
at the interests of peace and stability in the region. On the way towards membership we


-----

will realize, also, the utilization of partnership mechanisms with these organizations, in
the interest of national security.

The establishment and development of sincere and reciprocal relationships with
neighboring countries and also, the rights and freedom of Albanian citizens everywhere,
are a priority for the security of the Republic of Albania.

The consolidation and improvement of the instruments of security serve to the protection
of national interests without violating the interests or security of the other countries.
They are an expression of the protecting policy of sovereignty and independence,
freedom and prosperity, peace and integrity of a democratic country, protecting oneself
and as a pledge to give our contribution to the international context.

**PART ONE**

**THE SECURITY STRATEGY**

**I .THE CONCEPT OF THE STRATEGY OF SECURITY**

**1. The** National Security Strategy **of the Republic of Albania represents the integral**
official means and instruments guaranteeing the protection of citizens, society and the
Albanian state from external and domestic threats and risks. Its main object is to face the
possible challenges of security for the present and the future, taking into consideration
the geo strategic environment of security, the guarantee level that collective systems of
security give, and also the Country’s disposal resources and real capacities.

**2. The principal feature of the Strategy of security is to respect the rule of law. The**
Strategy of security has as its own resource and basis the Constitution of the Republic of
Albania and the Albanian legislation. It respects all international agreements, treaties,
and conventions in which the Republic of Albania takes part. The Strategy becomes
successful by bringing closer the viewpoints of all actors and components of the security,
despite all the different affiliations.

**3. Strategy vision focusing on integration.** Collective security defense is the future
perspective of all the countries that aim the fulfillment of the contemporary and
democratic standards of security. The National Security Strategy of the Republic of
Albania is based on the concept of an accelerated approach of our country, through
multidimensional and graduated reforms, in the European and Euro-Atlantic collective
security structures, putting special emphasis on EU and NATO, based on the United
Nations provisions for the security and collective protection. It is to be taken in
consideration that the efforts to the integration in the collective structures will be
accompanied by the consolidation of reforms in the system of security and protection of
the country, to adapt and come closer to the organization and functioning of collective
structures.


-----

**4. The transformation of Albania from a security consumer into a country that**
**contributes to the security.** Our country is a NATO partner and aspiring country,
included in the negotiations of the Stabilization and Association Agreement with EU, as
well as into a considerable number of regional initiatives. The level of security of the
country will be fostered by successfully accomplishing the programs and standards of
Partnership for Peace and also the Agreement of Stabilization and Association. Another
approach to foster the level of security will be the active participation and contribution in
the initiatives for the enhancement of political and military confidence in the region. The
implementation of the programs of bilateral and multilateral cooperation and of the
standards of integration, will be closely related even with the continuation of concrete
contribution of Albania in the interest of common missions, of peace and regional and
global security, executed in compliance with the mandate of international organisms in
which our country is an adherent.

**5. The strategy of security is a strategy of action.** The Strategy of Security of the
Republic of Albania includes the interests, the objectives and the priorities of the
country, and also the ways and the programs for their realization. The Strategy of
Security constitutes a document integrated with the quality and authority of the basic and
adjusting document of the development of all the sector strategies, which are part of the
institutions of the state. Its main aim is to advance the national interests by consolidating
the main instruments of the security of the country. The strategy supports the conception
of a system for planning the security to achieve concrete result under the concept: “ who
does what, when, and cooperating with who”.

**6.The strategy of priority selection for the use of resources. Our country actually has**
limited national resources and well-defined priorities. As a result, the use of resources
for the development of vital sectors of the economy of the country, of education, of
public health, infrastructures for alleviation of social issues, and for the strengthening of
the democratic institutions of the country will strongly influence in the raising of the
level of security in the country. Based on our limited resources, this strategy supports
with priority the development of national structures with two or more functions.

**7.Dialogue, cooperation and peaceful means to solve disputes. Some of the priorities**
of our foreign and internal affairs policy are the respect of human rights in the Albanian
territory, despite political, religious, regional, racial, ethnic, cultural, or social origin
pertaining and also the protection by institutional means of the rights of the Albanian
living out of the borders of the RA, also including Albanian citizens who are temporally
or permanently living out of the country. The strategy supports the sensitive changes in
the balance of security in favor of political means, of the institutions of security and
diplomacy, and the dimension and human dignity in a democratic system. The use of
military force will be executed only to guarantee the constitutional right to protect the
vital interests of the country by all means, if they are at stake, as well as to contribute
inside our country or outside, participating in humanitarian and peace support operations.
Albania will never constitute a danger for its neighboring countries, nor will try to use its
military capacities as a means of pressure and coercion towards other parties, as it will


-----

not tolerate other countries to use or to threaten by using their military capacities against
it.

**8.The promotion of a rapid development of the economy and free trade.** The
development of a healthy economy, struggling against the informal economy and
corruption, constitutes a key factor in the consolidation of institutions and national unity,
as well as for the accomplishment of other standards important for the integration. This
will offer other opportunities for business development and for creating a favorable
economic climate for foreign investors. Through a strategic participation and the
integration of the Albanian economy at a regional, European and global level, we aim to
gradually increase the impact of economic factor over national security.

**9.The consolidation of security institutions of our country. The effectiveness of the**
security system of the country, will be measured and estimated by the level of security
that this system will produce for its own citizens, for the state, for the region and
furthermore. The essence of reform in the domain of security, as a cyclic and wholly
inclusive process, will be the further transforming consolidation of all institutions of
security. This reform will be concentrated on the solution of real challenges that have to
do with the Albanian citizen and the country, starting from the facing of the demands in
the economic development, up to the fight against corruption, unemployment and
poverty. The reformation becomes necessary even in fighting the risks of a transnational
character such as terrorism, illegal traffics and organized crime. These new challenges
will require the development of new strategies of sectors in diplomacy, economy,
protection, order, justice, intelligence service etc., reforming respective institutions.

**10.The Armed Forces as one of most important institutions of the country’s**
**security. The Armed Forces will aim to accomplish the constitutional missions through**
the development of a military strategy and doctrine, a legal and contemporary context,
and the organization of a military force more professionally qualified. Its aim will be,
parallel to their basic constitutional mission to protect the independence and territorial
integrity of the country, also to actively participate in a wide spectrum of humanitarian
operations in the country, and also in international missions with constitutional mandates
outside the country. The defense reforms will keep under special focus the programming
of periodic review of the development and position of the Armed Forces adapting to the
new situations of the security environment, reflecting concrete answers through new
organizations missions, tasks and roles for all structures of the Armed Forces, always
taking into account concrete needs of our country, and standards and structures of EuroAtlantic collective defense.

**11.An organized response towards organized crime, corruption, and illegal**
**trafficking. The institutions of security, in close cooperation with the organs of**
Prosecution and the respective international bodies will aim at the implementation of the
concept of preventing and neutralizing the risks and menaces against public order. The
attack against organized crime, illegal trafficking and corruption will consist in a new
strategy and organized response from the consolidated institutions of public order,
justice, intelligence services, etc. The protection of stability and security against internal


-----

challenges will be aimed and achieved through the further development of a specific
legal context and a rigorous implementation of the law. The institution of justice will
guarantee the implementation of laws in the country by establishing not only the rights
but also the sanctions against whoever violates them. The long-term guarantee of
national interests requires the approximation of legislation in these domains according to
EU norms.

**12.The contemporary use of information, in support of the national security. The**
rapid and accurate provision of information is inseparably related with the appropriate
decision-making and rapid reactions undertaken to neutralize the consequences that
affect the national security. The strategy considers information as a very important factor
in strengthening national security by respecting the protection of the rights and
constitutional freedom of citizens and the freedom of media. The protection of national
security also requires the prevention of the use of information to manipulate the public.
The protection of classified information of the state in special fields and between the
states will be guaranteed without excluding the exchange of information with
international organizations that spring from the agreements among the parties.

**13.The evaluation of environmental factors in the security of the country. The**
protection and regeneration of Albanian nature will secure an ecological environment
and favorable living conditions of the citizens and society. The national interests require
the taking of measures for a rational exploitation of natural resources through the
development of a balanced strategy of sectors for the protection of natural environment
in favor of constant development of Albania.

**II. THE SECURITY OBJECTIVES**

**14. The Security Strategy objectives are short term, mid term, and long term in nature.**
The realization of these objectives aims at creating a fundamental, interactive link among
the national interests, needs and capabilities of the country.

**15.The engagement for the realization of these principal objectives stands on a**
**short term and mid term plan:**

**15. 1. Peace and security in the country. The inner stability of the country is a product**
of the state of law to protect its citizens, civil society and the state form anti-legal action.

**15. 2. Regional cooperation. The establishment of regional relationships stands on the**
basis of this new vision, regarding the common policies of cooperation and mutual
understanding. Our common aim is the integration in European and Euro-Atlantic
structures so as to turn our region into a factor of peace, stability and prosperity.

**15. 3. Consolidation of a democratic society and human rights observation.** The
strengthening of institutions of the state is the guarantee for the development of
democratic society. A society that has high standards of respecting the human rights
makes up a guarantee for a safe environment and harmonious relation between the


-----

society and the individual. The individual, the society and the state have common
obligations about the security of the country. The violation of these obligations even on
one side, heavily damages its security. The active role of Non governmental
organizations, contributes to the consolidation of democratic standards of society.

**15.4 The consolidation of institutions and instruments of security. These should be**
seen as the ability to protect the national interests and as a responsibility to act in every
situation. They are considered as decisive factors in the success of democracy and free
trade economy in a developed Albania.

**15.5 The economic consolidation. The economic consolidation of the country, toward**
European levels in infrastructure, being an active participant into regional and European
markets, will enable Albania to profit more effectively from its favorable geo-strategic
position.

**16.The basic objectives of mid-term and long-term plans that should be taken into**
**consideration are as follows:**

**16.1 The integration in Euro-Atlantic and European structures. The membership in**
EU and NATO remains the main objective regarding, and in the interest of, the security
of the country.

**16.2 The approximation of legislation to the standards of EU. The approximation of**
the legislation and the effective functioning of the state of law are long-term guarantees
to protect the national interests and also for the integration of Albania.

**16.3** **The Albanian national issue. Regional stability is considered as a condition**
towards the integration of regional counties in Europe. Albania aspires to be an active
partner in the regional policy. In this context, the Albanian national issue will be
achieved through European and Euro-Atlantic integration of the countries of the region
and also solutions that will provide a long-term and acceptable guarantee for the
international community.

**16.4 Environment and natural resource protection .The environment and the natural**
resources are key elements for generating instruments of security.

**16.5 The consolidation of Armed Forces. This process will be executed through a**
periodic review of the strictures of the Armed Forces depending on the situations and
developments in the environment of security. Capability to protect the territorial integrity
and independence of the country are an expression of the people’s will to secure
themselves without threatening other countries.

**16.6 The fight against terrorism.** The fight against terrorism directly engages all
specialized structures of the state police, Intelligence Service of the state and the Armed
Forces. In this context, in collaboration with international specialized organizations, the
appropriate structures will work on the enrichment and improvement of the legal basis


-----

and on the restructuring of specialized organs. Their objective is the maximum of
efficiency in the fight against terrorism.

**16. 7. The fight against organized crime and corruption. The fight against organized**
crime and corruption will continue to be at the center of activity of the state and
Albanian society. The Albanian legal institutions are obliged to interact with
effectiveness. The implementation of law in the war against organized crime and
corruption, constitute a crucial element for the security in the Republic of Albania

**PART TWO**

**THE STRATEGIC CONTEXT OF SECURITY**

**III .THE ENVIRONMENT OF SECURITY**

**17.The regional and worldwide situation at the beginning of the new Millennium has**
brought about new elements in the international strategic environment of security. These
outcomes have tangibly influenced in the change of policy and the environment of
security.

**18. Trafficking of human beings, weapons and drugs, criminal organizations, organized**
crime, terrorism and the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction are emerging as
transnational phenomena and challenges that could considerably affect the security,
peace and stability of all countries. These illegal activities have extended furthermore
their area of activity, by surpassing the dimensions of national borders.

**19. The existence of the increasing risk from these phenomena has made indispensable a**
comprehensive approach of all security and stability policies, taking into consideration
all kind of aspects, political, military, economic, human, social, and environmental, of
information, etc.

**20. The complexity and interstate character of these phenomena emphasize the**
importance of a collective action and indispensability of establishing the reciprocal
confidence building measures.

**21. The incorporation of Central and Eastern European states in the international**
institutions, the stimulation of regional initiatives, the process of partnership,
collaboration, dialogue, transparency and the establishment of common measures of
security are the most effective ways for a new environment of security.

**22. Historical outcomes have identified the Balkans as a region full of conflicts and**
frequent tensions. Having an important geo-strategic position as a bridge between East
and West, this region has historically been included in the configuration of influences
and interests of different worldwide powers, which many times has influenced in its
becoming an area of confrontation and conflicts. On the other hand, the reasons for


-----

numerous crises that have characterized this part of Europe are explained by the ethnic
divisions, mixture of different cultures and religious communities, underdevelopment of
economy, culture and democracy.

**23. The conflicts in the Balkans in the last decade have exposed the region to the new**
challenges and threaten to put it in the center of phenomena such as: Trafficking of
people, weapons, narcotics, organized crime, and terrorism. These are potential risks for
the stability and peace in the region. As a consequence, the region has been frequently
used as a bridge for illegal actions from problem countries of origin, towards the
countries of destination in the European Union and further.

**24. Like many countries of ex- Eastern block, Albania has had to face the consequences**
of totalitarian system and transition. The 1997 crisis and humanitarian crisis that came as
a result of the conflict in Kosovo have had their own impact and aggravated the internal
environment of security. All these needed the necessary time to be neutralized and
overcome.

**25. The Albanian factor in the Balkans is of prime importance, thus making the**
contribution and role of the Republic of Albania very important in creating a harmonious
atmosphere of co-existence and reciprocal collaboration for peace, welfare and integrity
of our region in the European family as fast as possible.

**26. Albania has taken and is still taking continuous measures to strengthen the internal**
security. Fulfilling the standards for integration in the European and Euro-Atlantic
structures requires maximal and continual engagement of state structures implementing a
range of important duties such as:

-  Strengthening the rule of law and democratic institutions;

-  Restructuring and modernization of the Armed Forces, the strengthening of civil
and democratic control.

-  Further development of economy and increase in standards of life;

-  Solution of vital problems of people, possibly in short periods of time.

-  The close cooperation between political leaders and opposition about important
issues of national security.

-  The Deepening of respect of human rights and also national minorities’ rights;

-  The close cooperation with international organisms and neighboring countries in
the fight against illegal traffic.

-  The constant engagement in the process of arms control and disarmament.

**IV.** **RISKS AND THREATS FOR THE SECURITY**

**27. When the cold war ended, the geo-political and geo-economic developments have**
put forth new risks and menaces about the interests and security of the Republic of
Albania. The today’s risks and menaces are characterized by different natures and
difficulty in prediction. Despite the difficulties of the definition of a clear-cut division,
they could be classified into risks and menaces of an internal transnational and global
nature.


-----

**28. The internal risks and threats:**

**28.1 The organized crime in the country,** becoming more perfect and professional,
represents a great risk for society and security of the Republic of Albania. The
disproportion between insufficient instruments at state disposal to discover, fight and
punish crime and dimensions and trends in the development of nowadays crime, consists
a real danger for the present and the future security of the Republic of Albania.

**28.2 Political instability** is a risk for the security of the Republic of Albania and
protection of national interests. The experience of democracy in Albania so far proves
that the political instability has been present in the internal environment. This
phenomena makes it difficult for the institutions to function the best way possible; it
risks the absence of social peace and public tranquility; it influences in the inability to
achieve political consensus about very important issues of the country and damages the
prestige of Albania in an international context. Political stability is a vital issue about
Albanian society.

**28.3 The insufficient economic development** and not fulfilling the vital elementary
necessities count for instability in the security and life of people in the Republic of
Albania. The negative phenomena that come as a consequence, like smuggling and
corruption bring about a deceleration of reforms, their deformation, stimulation of
unemployment, traffic and organized crime.

**28.4 the illegal immigration of Albanian citizens towards other countries presents a risk**
for the Albanian nation, for the country development and security in the Republic of
Albania. The effect of this uncontrolled phenomenon are shown by the loss of lives, the
uncontrolled flow of intelligence out of the country, artificial ageing of the population,
loss of desire to work and strengthening the sentiment of leaving the homeland.

**28.5 Natural disasters present a danger for the security of the Albanian Republic. Most**
possible natural disasters are: earthquakes, bad weather conditions, like: floods, massive
slides, massive forest fires, different epidemics. Disasters may also come from human
activity, such as industrial, terrestrial, air and naval disasters, results of criminal and
terrorist activity, etc.

**28.6 As far as security is concerned, demographic problems are a serious disturbance in**
the Albanian Republic. Uncontrolled population movement, mainly from the rural areas
towards the urban centers, has created considerable disproportion, not only regarding
overpopulation, but also abandonment of areas that for now and for the future, will need
human resources.

**28.7 Misinformation of the public opinion favors the destabilization. Inaccurate**
information, willingly or not, creates situations of insecurity, fear and unnecessary
tension and may very often lead to unfair public reactions and decision making. As such


-----

misinformation of public opinion consist a risk for the security of the Republic of
Albania.

**28.8 Inadequate development of education, science and culture has a negative impact**
on the Albanian republic security. A fundamental condition for the development,
prosperity and protection of the national identity are specialized human resources,
scientific capacities and a realistic presentation of our culture and tradition.

**29** **Threats and dangers of a transnational nature include** **regional and foreign**
dangers, in themselves.

**29.1 Military force usage, or of force in any other forms that endanger sovereignty,**
independence and integrity of the country, are a danger for the Albanian Republic.

**29.2 Regional destabilization, through revival of desire for the nationalistic feelings and**
**ethnic conflicts performance, presents transnational danger for the Albanian Republic.**

**29.3 Terrorism, as an extreme means of violence presents a real transnational danger for**
the Albanian Republic security. As an international danger, terrorism has widely spread
geographically. The geo-strategic position of Albania is one more element that leads
towards our country being used as a logistics and communication route. Militant and
extremist groups, which use violence as a way of realizing their political objectives, are a
serious danger in the security of people’s lives and functioning of the state in the
Albanian Republic.

**29.4 Organized crime presents direct danger of a transnational nature for the Albanian**
Republic security. Perfection of methods and means used by it, its regional and even
further geographical spreading, continuous economic strengthening, present a danger for
the Albanian Republic security.

**29.5 Illegal trafficking is a danger of a transnational nature for the Albanian Republic**
security. The Albanian geographical position, different economical and social conditions,
unemployment, poverty, loss of faith among social strata of the population, low education
level are a pre-condition that the region, and especially our country, be resource and
logistic communication routes for traffickers.

**30. Dangers of Global nature** present a real challenge for the whole international
community.

**30.1 Weapons of mass destruction and nuclear proliferation present a real danger of**
global nature that may touch even the Republic of Albania.

**30.2** Environment pollution and diseases of a massive nature are an increasing global
threat to peoples’ lives and the security of the Albanian Republic. There are different
reasons for the environmental pollution, such as: industrial (caused by factories and
transport vehicles’ remains), biological or chemical ones (caused by the scattering of the


-----

toxic remains and materials). They may also be caused by people’s carelessness, (trade
of uncontrolled food).

**30.3 Water resource reduction is a real increasing global danger. Climate and**
atmospheric change and further development of the society, are an evidence of water
resource insufficiency as a global danger.

**V. NATIONAL INTERESTS**

**31. Definition of national interests is decisive for the security development of the**
**country.** They give responsibility, legitimacy and credit to the political power, for the
functioning of the democratic state according to international norms. As a unique system
of interdependence among the power, society and citizens, the state is led, in essence by
definition and realization of national interests.

**32. It is the sublime duty of the political power to define, protect and develop national**
interests. This duty should be associated by the request and insurance of a wide
consensus among the public debate. Not all national interests (excluding survival
interests) can be mutual interests or interests in service of all. Thus, unanimity for the
definition and realization of national interests is not a necessity, but acceptance and
consensus are rules to be applied consequently in a democratic system.

**33. Vital interests guaranteeing, such as: exercise of sovereignty, protection of**
independence and territorial integrity of the country, protection of constitutional order;
protection of citizens’ life and of fundamental rights and duties, economic development,
protection of properties and values, form the essence of Albanian Republic security.

**34. National interests and deadlines of their realization are organically linked with**
security. Responsibility, legitimacy and honesty of the political power to be in service of
its nation and state, regardless of how long they stay in power; are the essence of national
interests’ realization. This softens and avoids contradicts which may exist between time
of a certain governing and the time it needs for the national interests.

**35. Determination of other interests helps in determining strategic solutions for the**
country’s security, in conformity with dangers, needs and objectives that should be
achieved. Such interests include: integration processes of the EU programs, NATO and
other Euro-Atlantic structures and organisms, development of bilateral relations with
neighboring countries and partners, solutions of social problems, protection of the
environment problems, etc.


-----

**PART THRE**

**THE ELEMENTS OF NATIONAL POWER**

**36. National security requires application of a multidimensional policy in function of**
**national interests’ protection against possible dangers. No policy can be successful in**
facing actual and coming challenges, without an efficient coordination and increase of
capacities of all elements of natural power. Preparation and development of the country’s
security cannot be defined only in the efficiency of a determined direction. Preparation in
all directions is a pre-condition. This approach enables increase of ability to face against
the broad spectrum of possible crises in time and effectively.

**VI. DIPLOMACY**

**37. Diplomacy is the most important instrument in creating an international environment**
suitable for preventing crises and conflicts and solving them by peaceful means.
Continuous political dialogue, that aims at the deepening of cooperation with neighbors,
partners and international institutions, is provided through it. The objective and essential
strategic solution for the country’s security and protection of national interests is the
integration policy in the Euro-Atlantic, European and regional structures. Level of
success in the realization of this policy depends on inner stability achievement and
consolidation of the state’s democratic institutions, affirming the Albanian republic in
continuance as a progressive and contributing factor in the regional and global security
processes.

**38. The Albania Republic pays special attention to further developing relations with the**
European Union. The Albanian government considers European and Euro Atlantic
integration to be a very important process in the development and future of the country.
The Republic of Albania is working on arriving at European standards and following the
example of the ten new members from Central and Eastern Europe, which signed the
European Union Membership Tractate; in close cooperation with other regional
countries, included in the Association Stabilization Process. Our country supports the EU
role increase in the security and defense fields, in application of the European Defense
and Security Policy, being convenient that it is a complementary element of the NorthAtlantic Alliance.

**39. Euro-Atlantic integration in one of the main piles of the foreign policy of the**
Republic of Albania. This fact, is evident and clearly testified by the progress done in the
Albania-NATO relations from the ‘90-s, form a close and specific cooperation that
Albania has reached with Atlantic Alliance, as well as by the full and without any
reserves support given to the political-military Alliance activity in the region. Our
country has been active in support of the widening of the Alliance in the South-Eastern
Europe, considering it a natural process, which will not only strengthen the South-Eastern
side of NATO, but it also will help in the strengthening of the democracy, peace,
stability, market economy and legal state in this area.


-----

**40. The role and contribution of U.S.A. on the consolidation of the democracy, legal state**
institutions as well as in the fight against crime and strengthening of the security in
Albania has been and remains fundamental. In a broader plan, the U.S.A. has given an
indispensable support in strengthening the security and stability in region, culminating
with firm intervention of NATO in resolving the Kosovo’s conflict.

**41. Republic of Albania considers the regional policy as one of its basic priorities.**
Through the application of the common sense dialogue with all regional factors, its
foreign policy aims at promoting the image of an Albania as a stability and peace factor
for the region.

**42.** With its foreign policy Albania aims to be definitely separated from the troubled
context of the ‘90 and conflicting Balkan inheritance, in order to concentrate on
important processes of collective cooperation at a regional level and beyond. Its motto
has been generation of common energies for a regional and Euro-Atlantic integration, for
the creation of economic interrelated webs with its aim to create a regional integrated
market of free commerce, energy, road infrastructure, etc. All of this will influence in the
continuing improvement of the security environment in the region.

**43.** For the Albanian diplomacy, it is natural the following of the Kosovo development
with priority and concentration, of the progress of relations and cooperation with it, as
well as its inclusion into the European integrated processes. In this context, our viewpoint
has always been and remains always the following of the 1244 Resolution of the UN
international community and fulfillment of the defined standards by the international
community before the final status. In the meantime, the Republic of Albania remains firm
in the viewpoint that the final status of Kosovo is an issue that pertains to its people and
to the international community that administrates it, as it continues to believe in
independence without the final solution of this status, and as a result there can’t be
stability and regional integration.
In this context, for the strategic security of the state and the whole Albanian society a
definite, democratic, as soon as it’s possible, resolution of the Kosovo status and it’s
corporation, as an separate entity, in the integration processes towards Euro-Atlantic
structures, has a fundamental importance.

**VII. Protection of public’s order and security**

**44. Construction and normal functioning of the state democratic institutions and of**
**the legal state are the most effective ways for the achievement of stability and of the**
**inner security. All the state activity, and that of the society, and of the individual must**
be covered by the correct application of this law. The citizen, society and state make a
permanent unity of the existence in Albania, and they must respect their respective
obligations. Realization and protection of their rights, expressed in the constitutions and
laws, is a duty of the state democratic institutions. All of these make the security structure
of the Republic of Albania, whereas the Constitution is the fundamental element of this
structure.


-----

**45. Consolidation of the democracy and inner stability will be achieved parallel to**
**the growth of the executive capabilities of the justice organs, to hit crime in all natures**
of its appearance. This seeks the programming and unification of the respective strategies
and an efficient cooperation in the inner plan and that international one.
