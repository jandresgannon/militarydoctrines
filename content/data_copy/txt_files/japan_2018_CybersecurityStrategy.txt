###### PREFACE

A free, fair and secure cyberspace is foundation of vital economic development and it contributes to the

peace and stability of the international community and Japan. Knowledge, technologies, and services in

cyberspace, such as AI, IoT, Fintech, robotics, 3D printers, and AR/VR, are becoming established in society,

and the unification of cyberspace and real space brings benefits to our lives. At the same time, the risk of

economic and social loss is expected to expand and accelerate exponentially. Due to the evolving methods

of cyber attacks, －organized, sophisticated, and possibly state-sponsored－, it is anticipated that threats

against the people's lives would become more serious in the future.

Under these circumstances, sustainable development and assurance of the security in cyberspace, namely,

cybersecurity, are not only essential to fulfill the Growth Strategy, but also  extremely important to national

security and crisis management. Especially, As Japan will host major international events, including the

G20 Osaka Summit, the Games of the XXXII Olympiad and the Tokyo 2020 Paralympic Games, it is the

upmost necessity, for their success to be achieved, to take all feasible measures to ensure cybersecurity in

close collaboration with international community.

Under the understanding, Japan will aims for sustainable development of cyberspace (Realizing

“Cybersecurity Ecosystem”) to realize a society (Society 5.0) where new values and service are generated

continuously, bringing abundance to the people. For that reason, Japan will adhere to its basic position

on cybersecurity presented in the Strategy 2015 and promote public and private sector initiatives on

cybersecurity based on three approaches (1. mission assurance for service providers; 2. risk management;

and 3. participation, coordination and collaboration).

Based on this strategy, Japan is determined to firmly take actions to maintain a free, fair and secure

cyberspace in close collaboration with international community. By doing so, Japan will contribute to

socio-economic vitality and sustainable development, build safe and secure society for the people and

play a leading role for maintaining peace and stability of the international community.

It is my sincere hope that the people of Japan as well as the people of other countries will develop a better

understanding of the directions of Japan's cybersecurity policies.

## Cybersecurity Strategy


（ Provisional Translation ）


-----

|1.1|A Paradigm Shift Brought About by Cyberspace|
|---|---|


Cyberspace, with the Internet as a central part of

its platform, rose out from the rapid development

of digital technology based on modern scientific

knowledge, and has continued to expand and

develop globally due to the autonomous

initiatives of multiple stakeholders,1 many of

which operate in the private sector.

As a result of its development, cyberspace has

allowed information and data, diverse in terms of

both volume and quality, to be freely created,

shared, and analyzed across national borders,

unfettered by either time or space. Thus,

cyberspace actors can potentially generate new

value by interacting with fellow actors.

As a result of these characteristics, cyberspace is a

place in which intellectual property, such as

technological innovations and new business

models can be created, and will continue to serve

as a platform for sustainable development of

economic society. This space also supports

liberalism, democracy, and cultural development,

as well as a place where people can utilize

creation and innovation to significantly expand

their activities.2 In other words, cyberspace is a

“frontier for generating infinite value.” Japan will

use all means under its disposal to undertake

cybersecurity initiatives in order to ensure that


cyberspace remains this way.

In the near future, the further development of

computer science for which cyberspace is a

prerequisite, such as artificial intelligence

(hereinafter referred to as “AI”), etc. is expected

to lead to the creation of new products and

services. The emergence of new products and

services change peoples’ awareness by changing

their daily behavior and living environment, and

this triggers the transformation of social systems

and industrial infrastructures that include existing

procedures, models, organizations, etc. As

humanity experiences a paradigm shift from

hunting society, agricultural society, industrial

society, and information society to “Society 5.0,3”

it is necessary to examine the future vision of

cybersecurity whilst taking into consideration

these transformations.


1 Multiple stakeholders are defined as “the national government, local governments, CII Operators, and Cyberspace-related Business

Entities” in Article 16 of the Basic Act on Cybersecurity. Article 7 of the same Act defines Cyberspace-related Business Entities as

“Cyberspace-Related Business Entities (referring to those engaged in business regarding the maintenance of the Internet and other

advanced information and telecommunications networks, the utilization of information and telecommunications technologies, or

involved in business related to Cybersecurity; the same applies hereinafter).”

2 In the Cybersecurity Strategy report (September 2015), the impact of these characteristics on society is compared to the explosion of

knowledge triggered by Gutenberg’s invention of letterpress printing.

3 Society 5.0 is the 5th stage of human history, following the hunting society, agricultural society, industrial society, and information

society. It is a society in which new value and new services are created continuously bringing wealth to the people of society.

(Source: Growth Strategy 2017 (Cabinet Decision on June 9, 2017))


-----

|1.2|Changes Since 2015|
|---|---|


The Cybersecurity Strategy (hereinafter referred

to as the “Strategy 2015”), enacted by the Cabinet

decision in September 2015 after deliberations by

the Cybersecurity Strategic Headquarters

(hereinafter referred to as the “Headquarters”)

according to the Basic Act on Cybersecurity4

(hereinafter referred to as the “Basic Act”) was

created as basic policy on cybersecurity-related

measures covering a period of three years.

Following the formulation of the Strategy 2015,

legal foundation for the utilization of data was

prepared, including the Basic Act on the

Advancement of Public and Private Sector Data

Utilization5 and the Amended Act on the

Protection of Personal Information,6 etc. The

Government has also adopted a policy of realizing

an anthropocentric society7 that achieves both

economic development and resolution of social

issues through the high level of integration of

cyberspace with real space. Under these

circumstances, massive amounts of data

generated by sensors and devices in real space are

currently being accumulated and analyzed in

cyberspace. Furthermore, the provision in real

space of new products and services that adds

value through use of data can be seen cyclically

emerging and developing in numerous domains.

No longer does cyberspace and real space exist as

independent entities, but as mutually interacting

entities, such that they cannot be considered

separate anymore. Therefore, the two spaces


should be seen as a single continuously evolving

organic entity.

The unification of cyberspace and real space

significantly increases the potential for affording

abundance to society. At the same time, it also

increases the opportunities for malicious actors

to abuse cyberspace. The risk of economic and

social loss or damage in real space is expected to

expand and accelerate exponentially.

Under these circumstances, the security of

cyberspace, which serves as the foundation of

economic society, must be ensured, and at the

same time, its autonomously sustained evolution

and development has to be ensured in order to

achieve sustainable progress and wealth to

society, Recently, there has been a trend for

certain nations to respond to cyber threats by

emphasizing management and control by the

state from a dominant position. However, the

strengthening of management and control of

cyberspace by the state has the effect of hindering

the possibility of autonomous and sustainable

development. Thus, the cyberspace of today that

developed through the autonomous initiatives of

all stakeholders must be respected, and

cybersecurity must be secured through

collaborative and cooperative initiatives with

those stakeholders.8

Based on this understanding, mindful of the state

of affairs to be pursued for 2020 and beyond and

taking into consideration the hosting of such

international events as the Games of the XXXII

Olympiad and the Tokyo 2020 Paralympic Games

(hereinafter referred to as “the Tokyo 2020


4 This Basic Act was enacted on November 6, 2014. It afforded a legal position for the concept of cybersecurity and clarified the

responsibilities of the various stakeholders.

5 This Act was enacted on December 7, 2016. It stipulates basic principles on the promotion of private sector data utilization.

6 This revised Act was enacted on September 3, 2015, and came into full effect on May 30, 2017. This Act was established to promote

anonymization as a precondition before the utilization of personal information.

8 The “Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs)” adopted at the United Nations Summit in September 2015 established 17 goals for

achieving a sustainable global society and a society in which “nobody is left behind.” There are several points shared between the

policy for cybersecurity initiatives here and the SDGs, such as aiming for sustainable development and initiatives based on the

cooperation and collaboration between all stakeholders.

Games”), Japan will spare no efforts regarding

cybersecurity measures by clarifying the basic vision

of cybersecurity, identifying new issues that need to

be tackled; and swiftly implementing measures.

This strategy clarifies the basic position and

approach to cybersecurity taken by Japan moving

forward, while clearly indicating both

domestically and internationally the goals and

implementation policies of the various measures

for the next three years in order to serve as the

basis for shared understanding and action.

Knowledge, technologies, and services in

cyberspace, such as AI, IoT,9 Fintech,10 robotics,

3D printers,11 and AR/VR,12 are becoming

established in society and leading innovations

that are transforming the existing structures in

socio-economic activities and the daily lives of

Japanese people, and these transformations are

bringing about progress in the unification of

cyberspace and real space.13

In order to create this strategy, an accurate

understanding of the benefits afforded by

cyberspace and the state of the threats in that

space must be considered to be prerequisites.

Furthermore, in order to enjoy the benefits of the

knowledge, technologies, and services of

cyberspace, it is essential to control the latent

uncertainties always therein. When such control

is not possible, the potential exists for

cybersecurity related threats to increase rapidly.

Technologies and services in cyberspace are

gaining routine use in numerous domains. The

continued sustainable development of cyberspace

is expected to bring about abundance for

humanity.

###### [1] Advancements in Services in Cyberspace and the Adoption

 thereof by Society

The number of Internet users in Japan is rising, as

has the spread of the Internet itself.14

Furthermore, in terms of devices, the rate of

personal smartphone ownership has increased

significantly,15 and the Internet usage rate is also

rising.16 The ratio of social media users is also

rising,17 as a result of which an environment now

exists for easily communicating in cyberspace.

The increasing adoption of services in cyberspace

by society has promoted not only the free flow of

information, but also the formation of diverse


10 A portmanteau combining the words finance and technology. It refers to new innovative financial services using new technologies

such as the blockchain, big data, and AI, carried out through such devices as smartphones and tablets that have rapidly spread to

wide adoption (Source: WHITE PAPER 2017 Information and Communications in Japan).

11 Compared to printers that output a flat (two dimensional) image to paper, a 3D printer forms three dimensional objects using three

dimensional data from 3D CAD and 3D CG (Source: Website of the Japan 3D Printing Industrial Technology Association)

12 Abbreviations of augmented reality and virtual reality.

13 Strategy 2015 states that “physical objects and people in real space have become interconnected in a multi-layered manner without

physical constraints, by harnessing the free flow of information and accurate data communications in cyberspace. Due to such

linkages, there is an emergence of an “interconnected and converged information society” where real space and cyberspace have

become highly integrated.”

14 Internet penetration rate among the general population (82.8% as of the end of 2014 rose to 83.5% as of the end of 2016) (Source:

WHITE PAPER 2017 Information and Communications in Japan)

15 Personal smartphone ownership rate (44.7% as of the end of 2014 rose to 56.8% as of the end of 2016) (Source: WHITE PAPER 2017

communities and the sharing of information.

There has been progress in the area of financial

activities as well, including online shopping, stock

trading, and online banking, while new services in

the areas of Fintech and the sharing economy18

are appearing regularly and leading innovation.

There has also been progress in the use of

information and communication technology in

medicine and nursing, welfare, education and

other areas related to social issues such as the

declining working-age population and the aging

of local communities.

###### [2] Dramatic Evolution of AI

With respect to AI, there have been recent

advancements in computer science, and in

research on machine learning which requires

massive quantities of data, giving rise to the new

approach of deep learning. The emergence of

deep learning has accelerated the optimization

and increase in quality of numerous functions in

socio-economic activities, including a significant

increase in the precision of AI based image

analysis, and increased precision in product

anomaly detection, cancer diagnosis, investment

decisions, and translation, and this technology is

beginning to be adopted in a wide range of

industries. Similarly, in the area of cybersecurity

this potential of AI is also beginning to see use in

the various measures such as the automation of

malware detection.

The evolution of AI based on deep learning is said


to be bringing about changes comparable to the

Cambrian explosion in the world of machines and

robotics.19 Deep learning has enabled the design

of feature extraction20 used in differentiation and

identification, a task that previously had to be

carried out by a human in standard machine

learning, to be carried out automatically by

computers, and this is considered an evolutionary

step for AI. Furthermore, a world in which AI is

able to autonomously generate output resulting

in creative works, such as music, paintings, and

novels, and self-driving services (for example

results from determination, decision making, and

proposal) without any creative contribution by

humans. The possibility has also been pointed

out regarding who would be responsible if AI

were to infringe rights or cause accidents.21

These developments in AI will lead to the

emergence of entirely new products and services,

and bring about changes in people’s daily

behavior and living environment in the future.

This will cause changes in the way that humans

perceive the world, which is expected to promote

the transformation of existing social systems and

industrial structures.

###### [3] Development of IoT

The reduction in size, weight, and cost of sensors

has enabled an explosive spread in IoT, in which

all things become connected to the network. In

addition to the use of things such as home

appliances, automobiles, robots, and smart


18 Economic revitalization activities in which personally owned assets that can potentially be used are made available for use by other

individuals via online matching platforms (Source: WHITE PAPER 2017 Information and Communications in Japan)

19 The Cambrian explosion is the phenomenon by which the phylum of animals existing today arose suddenly between 542 million

and 530 million years ago. Paleontologist Andrew Parker has presented the theory that the emergence of vision caused the

explosion. Deep learning enables vision for AI. This enables AI to predict what will happen next and take action. Thus, it means the

emergence of machines with eyes, and suggests that the equivalent of a Cambrian explosion will occur in the world of machines and

robotics (Source: Headquarters for Japan’s Economic Revitalization, the Fourth Industrial Revolution Conference to Promote Human

Resource Development (2nd Meeting) Document 1)

20 A quantitative expression of the important characteristics requiring attention when recognizing an object. Before the arrival of deep

meters, new businesses and services are being

created to utilize the data obtained from IoT

devices.

Specifically, efforts are being made to improve

productivity and afford high added value in the

areas of e-government, smart cities,

manufacturing, self-driving automobiles, finance,

health and medicine, and nursing,22 and the

utilization of data is expected to progress in the

various supply chains23 for those domains.

Furthermore, there has been progress in so-called

open innovation24 in which cooperation occurs

across domains via cyberspace, and new services

are expected to emerge continuously that

generate more abundance for people through the

sharing and analysis of data.

|2.2|Increasing Threats in Cyberspace|
|---|---|


While AI and IoT technologies and services have

the potential to bring many benefits to people,

there is always the latent risk that the providers of

these technologies and services will lose the

ability to control them, in which case they can

cause immeasurable economic and social loss or

damage. As the unification of cyberspace and real

space proceeds, the likelihood that such severe

effects occur increase exponentially. Furthermore,

cyberspace is a place unrestricted by space or

time where anyone, including malicious actors,

can misuse and abuse new information and

communication technologies to act with ease. In

addition to the ability for malicious actors and

groups of such actors to easily copy and distribute

data and information, including attack programs,

which is due to the very nature of digital

technology, they can also flexibly incorporate and

make free use of developing technologies such as

AI and the blockchain.25 For that reason, the

attackers have an asymmetrical advantage over

the defenders, and that advantage is expected to

increase particularly when the defender’s

formation depends on existing policies and

technological systems.

Given these conditions, attacks26 directed at IoT,

Fintech including cryptcurrencies, critical


22 The Declaration to Be the World’s Most Advanced Digital Nation / Basic Plan for the Advancement of Public and Private Sector Data

Utilization (Cabinet Decision on June 15, 2018) defines eight priority fields (electronic administration; health, medical, and nursing

care; tourism; finance; agriculture, forestry, and fisheries; manufacturing; infrastructure, disaster management, and disaster

reduction; and mobility) expected to help solve issues such as (1) economic revitalization and the restoration of financial health, (2)

regional revitalization, and (3) ensuring the safety and security of the lives of the people by promoting public and private sector

data utilization.

23 The supply chain refers to the flow of goods and information in business activities from upstream to downstream, from the receiving

and placing of orders between suppliers and the procurement of materials to inventory management and product delivery.

24 Open innovation refers intentionally and proactively utilizing the flow of internal resources, such as technologies and ideas, in and

out of the organization to promote internal innovation, and deploying the resulting internal innovations outside the organization to

increase market opportunities.

and hash pointers. By storing the relevant data on multiple nodes distributed throughout the network, the technology achieves high

data availability and integrity. (Source: Japan Blockchain Association, “Blockchain Definition”)

infrastructure, and supply chains have occurred

both inside and outside Japan, causing direct

financial losses and the interruption of businesses

and services in addition to the usual data breach,

and serving to threaten the safety and security of

the sustainable development of socio-economic

activities and the people’s living. There have also

been massive incidents suspected to have been

state-sponsored. There is also the concern that

credibility of the information infrastructure may

be shaken if a cyberspace is controlled and

managed by some countries from a superior

position.

It is believed that as cyberspace continues to

become further unified with real space, there will

be increased concerns over potential attempts to

target weaknesses in IoT, supply chains, and open

innovation, and for unintended behavior to occur

in these systems. It is expected that serious

impacts may occur not only for governmental

bodies and critical infrastructure operators, but

for other businesses and even individuals.

###### [1] Major Effects on Society Due to

 Interruptions to Business, Functions,

 and Services

Society will be significantly affected when

interruptions occur to numerous businesses,

functions, and services due to the interruption of

important infrastructural services or unintended

behavior by IoT devices, and situations could

even develop to the point of becoming national

security issues. If the unification of cyberspace

and real space continues to progress further,

contingencies may occur that threat the safety

and security of the people and the very roots of

democracy and the state, including the disabling

of the functions of society and risks to human life

and livelihood.

27 A characteristic that ensures an actor or resource is as claimed.

28 The information has not been damaged, modified, or deleted.



###### [2] Reduced Competitiveness Due to the Loss or Breach of Information

With the explosive spread in IoT and the

increasing practice of making data publicly

available, new services that use data will continue

to increase in number. There will also be progress

in the use of AI for data analysis. Data used for

deep learning is directly related to the

performance of the AI. As the importance of data

continues to increase, damage to the authenticity27

or integrity28 of the data will undermine trust in

the services that use the data.

In addition to being subject to claims for

compensation for loss or damages, the data

breach, such as personal information, trade

secrets, and other valuable data, can also invite a

fall in the reputation and trust an organization or

company receives from society. Once breached,

such data can never be taken back, and can lead

directly to a drop in the competitiveness of the

organization or company.

###### [3] Loss from Financial Theft and Fraud

Incidents have occurred in which inadequacies in

basic measures for cybersecurity have led to

unauthorized access to virtual currency exchange

operators and massive financial damages through

business email compromise. As socio-economic

activities are expected to grow more and more

dependent on cyberspace, inadequacies in

cybersecurity measures are predicted to directly

cause and expand financial damages and losses.


-----

The visions and objectives of this Strategy are

clarified below as the firm maintenance of Japan’s

basic position on cybersecurity, and in light of

such position, “the basic vision of cybersecurity”

under the current understanding of cyberspace

and its future image.

###### 3.1 [Adherence to the Basic] Position on Cybersecurity

Japan will adhere to its basic position on

cybersecurity including the “objectives of the

Basic Act on Cybersecurity” and the “basic ideas

and principles” presented in the Strategy 2015.

On that basis, in order to continue to deter

malicious actors’ activities and guarantee people’s

safety and rights, Japan retains, as its options,

political, economic, technological, legal,

diplomatic, and all other viable and effective

means.

###### [1] Objectives of the Basic Act on Cybersecurity

The Basic Act aims to “improve socio-economic

vitality and sustainable development,” “building a

safe and secure society for the people,” and

“contributing to peace and stability of the

international community and national security.29”

This strategy also arranges policy goals within

these three areas in order to promote measures

accordingly.



**[2] Basic Ideals**

The basic ideals to which Japan will adhere to

contribute to the objectives of the Basic Act is to

aim for a “free, fair and secure cyberspace.” Such

a cyberspace means a secure cyberspace in which

the freedom of expression and economic activities

of all actors active therein is guaranteed without

any discrimination or exclusion with no justifiable

reasons, and where unlawful activities such as the

theft of information or assets are not allowed.

###### [3] Basic Principles

The five principles stipulated by the Strategy

2015 as the basic principles to adhere to for

developing and implementing cybersecurity

measures are: (i) assurance of the free flow of

information; (ii) the rule of law; (iii) openness;

(iv) autonomy; and (v) collaboration among

multi-stakeholders.

###### (i) Assurance of the Free Flow of
 Information

For the sustainable development of cyberspace as

a place for creation and innovation, it is

imperative to build and maintain a world in which

transmitted information reaches the intended

recipient without being unfairly censored or

illegally modified en route.30 Consideration for

privacy must also be maintained. As a basic

condition for the free flow of information in cyber

space, morality and commonsense are requested

|3.1|Adherence to the Basic Position on Cybersecurity|
|---|---|


29 Article 1 of the Basic Act stipulates that “the purpose of this Act is to comprehensively and effectively promote the cybersecurity

policy ... and as a result, attempting to enhance economic and social vitality, sustainable development and realizing social

conditions where the people can live with a sense of safety and security, and contributing to the protection of international peace

and security as well as national security.”

30 Article 1 of the Basic Act stipulates “to ensure the free flow of information ... simultaneously.”


-----

not to offend rights and interests of others.

###### (ii) The Rule of Law

As the unification of cyberspace and real space

progresses, the rule of law should also be

maintained in cyberspace in the same way as in

real space. Various domestic rules and norms,

including domestic laws and regulations, are

applied in cyberspace. Similarly, existing

international law is also applied in cyberspace.

Application of existing international law and

development of norms continue to be essential

for sustainable development of cyberspace as a

safe and reliable space.

###### (iii) Openness

In order to achieve the sustainable development

of cyberspace as a space to generate new values,

cyberspace must be open to all actors without

restricting possibilities of linking diverse ideas

and knowledges. Japan adheres to the position

that cyberspace must not be exclusively

dominated by some a certain group of actors

therein.31

###### (iv) Autonomy

Cyberspace has developed through the

autonomous initiatives of multi-stakeholders. It is

inappropriate and impossible for a state to take

on the entire role of maintaining order for

cyberspace to sustainably develop as a space

where order and creativity coexist. The only

approach to deter and address malicious actors’

behavior to maintain order in cyberspace is for

various social systems to achieve their missions

and functions autonomously. The Government


will promote this approach.32

###### (v) Collaboration among Multi- stakeholders

Cyberspace is a multi-dimension world

established through activities of multi
stakeholders, including the state, local

governments, critical infrastructure operators,

cyber-related and other businesses, education

and research institutions, and individuals. For the

sustainable development of cyberspace, all actors

are required to consciously fulfill their respective

roles and responsibilities. To do so, coordination

and collaboration is required in addition to

individual efforts. States have the role of

promoting this coordination and collaboration,

and will promote measures enabling the

fulfillment of such roles.33


31 Article 3 of the Basic Act on the Formation of an Advanced Information and Telecommunications Network Society stipulates that

“every people has an opportunity to easily and independently use the Internet and other advanced information and

telecommunications networks.”

32 Article 3 Paragraph 2 of the Basic Act stipulates that “The promotion of the Cybersecurity policy must be carried out with the intent

to raise awareness to each member of the public about Cybersecurity and encourage each member of the public to take voluntary

actions.”

33 Article 3 Paragraph 1 of the Basic Act stipulates that “(Cybersecurity policy) must be carried out with the intent to produce active

responses to threats against Cybersecurity through coordination among multiple stakeholders.”


-----

|3.2|Basic Vision of Cybersecurity as a Goal|
|---|---|


Based on Japan’s idea mentioned above, the

following presents the desired outcome that

cybersecurity initiatives must aim for and three

approaches required to promoting such initiatives

as the “basic vision of cybersecurity.”

###### [1] Goal

Japan aims to realize a society34 in which

cyberspace develop sustainably as “frontier

generating infinite values,” where new values and

services are generated continuously, bringing

abundance to the people.

In order to contribute to the realization of such

society, cyberspace must develop through

participation of all actors in generating new

values. To support this sustainable development,

all actors are required to be aware of their own

roles with regard to cybersecurity and implement

cybersecurity approaches autonomously, just like

the immune systems of living things.

With such perspectives, the government will

implement the following initiatives in order to

promote cybersecurity initiatives.

Specifically, we will promote public and private

sector initiatives on cybersecurity based on three

approaches (1. mission assurance of service

providers; 2. risk management; and 3.

participation, coordination and collaboration)

with the aim of autonomous and sustainable

evolution and development of reliable cyberspace

while realizing both security and economic

development in cyberspace.

The image of cyberspace evolving this way

through autonomous initiatives of all

stakeholders mutually impacting each other will

be called the “Cybersecurity Ecosystem” as


compared to a type of ecosystem that develops

sustainably.

###### [2] Three Approaches (i) Mission Assurance for Service Providers

Reliable execution of operations and services

“Mission Assurance” refers to the condition in

which any organization represented by

companies, critical infrastructure operators, and

government bodies understand the operations or

services that they should carry out as their

“missions,” and ensure necessary capabilities and

resources to reliably execution such “missions.”

As part of that assurance, it is vital, from the

standpoint of each organization carrying out their

operations or services as “missions,” for those

responsible in each organization to proactively

work towards securing cybersecurity without

relying on some experts.

In other words, this means that senior executives

or managers of each organization should identify

operations or services that represent their

“missions” and take all responsibility for secure

and sustainable provision, rather than making

cybersecurity initiatives themselves the goal.

###### (ii) Risk Management

Assessment of Uncertainty and Appropriate

Response

“Risk management” means to minimize risks to

an acceptable level by identifying, analyzing, and

evaluating risks35 associated with “missions”

assigned to organizations. The innate uncertainty

of cyberspace unavoidably leads to this

viewpoint.

Risk is defined as “the effect of uncertainty on

objectives,”36 and measurable only by considering

the established objectives. Therefore, evaluation


34 This refers to Society 5.0 (Sources: Comprehensive Strategy on Science, Technology and Innovation (STI) for 2017 (Cabinet

decision on June 2, 2017), Growth Strategy 2017 (Cabinet decision on June 9, 2017)).

35 Note that this refers to uncertainty that has both positive and negative aspects.

36 Definition given by the International Organization for Standardization (ISO)


-----

of or response to risks differs depending on

objectives of the organization. Furthermore, risk

management is defined37 as “coordinated set of

activities and methods that is used to direct an

organization and to control many risks that can

affect its ability to achieve objectives,” and thus

represents the overall set of activities of

addressing risks through directing and controlling

organizations and appropriately distributing

organization’s limited resources, which is not the

individual activities of identifying, analyzing or

evaluating risks.

If each organization underestimates risks without

acknowledging operations or services which

represent its “mission” and does not allocate

necessary resources to cybersecurity, it may lead

to contingencies that can threaten the very

survival of the organization. On the other hand, if

the risks are overestimated and excessive

resources are allocated to cybersecurity, it could

impede the execution of organization’s operations

or services and its sustainable growth.

Such an approach to risk management is

necessary for all, even individuals, who enjoy the

benefits of utilizing knowledges, technologies or

services of cyberspace.

When enjoying benefits, it is common for risks of

losing control of prerequisite technologies or

services to emerge. Accordingly, since mechanical

prediction does not hold, and it is impossible to

eliminate the risk completely, we need to

properly address such risks according to the

nature or manifestation of each risk, and

minimize cybersecurity risks at an acceptable

level in counterbalance with the merits of services

and products provided thereof.

###### (iii) Participation, Coordination, and Collaboration

Measures, coordination and cooperation by


individuals and organization from peacetime

“Participation, coordination and collaboration”

applies to fundamental initiatives implemented

by individuals or organizations from peacetime to

prevent damages or its escalation possibly caused

by threats in cyberspace. Any actor operating in

cyberspace may potentially create new values as

their benefits, but they may also be exposed to

threats emerging from inherent risks. From this

standpoint, it is necessary for not only

organizations providing services but also

individuals to take day-to-day basic cybersecurity

efforts from peacetime.

Specifically, this includes measures to protect

against malicious programs, mitigate

vulnerabilities,38 secure reliability of certifications,

and manage personal information properly,

among other things. These initiatives are often

compared to public hygiene activities or

transportation safety campaigns carried out in

real space.

However, while cyberattacks may occur anytime

or anywhere and threats become a daily concern,

it is difficult to respond through individual efforts

alone, and proactive support by other

stakeholders including organizations, is required

to strengthen such initiatives.

For this reason, it is necessary for everyone to

work on initiatives together, which means they

must cooperate. In addition to working on

individual initiatives, it is necessary for every

individual or organization involved in cyberspace

to share information and mutually coordinate

and collaborate between each other regardless of

peacetime or emergency situations. These basic

cybersecurity efforts should be regarded as new

cyber hygiene.

Accordingly, we need to support through public
private partnership to promote such fundamental

initiatives. Particularly, under the principle of


37 Definition given by the International Organization for Standardization (ISO)

38 People, things, and flaws in services that trigger threats.


-----

“collaboration among multi-stakeholders” listed

under the Basic Principles, Japan must proactively

carry out the role of promoting collaboration and

coordination on a daily basis.


-----

The following are the targets and guidelines of

the policies scheduled to be implemented in the

coming three years, for delivering results of the

strategy. Each policy is expected to be consistent

with the following three approaches described in

Japan’s Idea on Cybersecurity and the Basic Vision

of Cybersecurity.

###### Enabling Socio-Economic
 4.1 Vitality and Sustainable
 Development

Enterprises are improving productivity of their

business with active use of digital devices, such as

personal computers and smart phones, and the

Internet. Such technologies are also utilized to

introduce business innovation, leading-edge

services, and other new values. Cybersecurity

measures should be regarded as “investments” as

the basis to drive those trends, rather than

unwanted “costs.” Consistent cybersecurity

measures bring about industrial growth and

global competitiveness, and are critical for Japan’s

socio-economic vitality and sustainable

development.

###### 4.1.1 [Advancing Cybersecurity ] as Value Creation Driver

Enterprises will face even higher cybersecurity

risks along with the integration of cyberspace and

real space. Cybersecurity awareness is increasing

among a few industrial sectors and larger

enterprises. Going forward, it is necessary in all

industrial sectors to spread the understanding

that cybersecurity initiatives must be carried out


to ensure corporate business continuity and

create new value, and to promote those

initiatives.

In doing so, it is important to understand that

cybersecurity related risks are one type of risks

enterprises are facing and that measures should

be handled as part of risk management. In

addition, these measures should take root in

organizations naturally according to the situation

of each industry and business.

###### [1] Raising Executive Awareness

It appears the majority of business leaders are

still obsessed with an idea that cybersecurity

measures bring no profit for their business. This

belief may come from an idea that cyberattack

preparedness is nothing more than an unwanted

“cost,” since cyberspace is supposed to be offered

for free without any precaution, and that

cyberattacks to damage their business seldom

happen. As the use of cyberspace grows rapidly,

however, enterprises should understand that

threats exist precisely because of this freedom

and be prepared against them. Enterprises may

find cybersecurity measures are difficult to adopt

without organization-wide discussion to define

their importance. Raising executive awareness is

essential as they are expected to play evangelistic

role in penetrating thoughts that cybersecurity

measures are indispensable investments for

ensuring business continuity and value creation,

but not inevitable costs.

Specifically, senior executives are expected to

actively engage in cybersecurity through

executive meetings and should acquire a certain

level of knowledge and skills for risk management

|4.1|Enabling Socio-Economic Vitality and Sustainable Development|
|---|---|

|4.1.1|Advancing Cybersecurity as Value Creation Driver|
|---|---|


-----

in cybersecurity affairs. However, requiring in
depth technical knowledge and skills to senior

executives may not be quite realistic. Therefore,

enterprises need to secure human resources (or

“strategic management level”) who are capable

to grasp cybersecurity risks in the contexts of

management and business strategies, plan

cybersecurity measures in line with executive

policies, and lead both business and technical

personnel. Senior executives should build up

appropriate risk management schemes for the

entire supply chain, covering both their own and

contractor organizations. Senior executives also

should be accountable to shareholders for

benefits and risks of business enabled by

cyberspace.

Given this situation, the government will work in

cooperation with private sectors to discover and

train personnel who are capable of explaining and

discussing cybersecurity measures with senior

executives while hosting seminars for senior

executives to promote a change in thinking. The

government will also promote policies to appeal

the importance of cybersecurity measures to

senior executives in an easy to understand

manner. These policies include the

encouragement of declarations regarding

company initiatives and the development of tools

to visualize measures to make comparisons with

measures taken by similar companies. The

government will also work with academia to

organize various legal systems that enterprises

should refer to when implementing their

cybersecurity measures.

###### [2] Stimulating Cybersecurity Investments

Corresponding managerial incentives are

important for ensuring companies to implement

cybersecurity initiatives on a continuous basis.

Specifically, a virtuous cycle is desirable in which

cybersecurity risks and associated measures are

made visible including those from a financial


perspective, senior executives understand the

state of affairs and study and implement further

specific measures necessary, the market positively

evaluates those initiatives as efforts that lead to

more corporate value, and incentives for

cybersecurity investment are continuously

generated.

To this end, it is important for companies to

actively disseminate and disclose information

regarding their cybersecurity initiatives. The

government will share information on best

practices and create guidelines while working on

the continuous grasping and evaluation of the

state of information dissemination and disclosure.

In addition, it is necessary to go forward on the

creation of a framework for investors to evaluate

cybersecurity initiatives from corporate

management.

Regarding measures aimed at enterprises to

promote cybersecurity, the government will

follow up on the use of incentives for investment

in cybersecurity so that they function effectively,

and consider required measures as necessary.

Furthermore, the use of insurance is on the rise as

a risk management approach to cybersecurity.

This may make it easier to promote investment

because the cost of preparing for risks will be

clarified by the system in which insurance

premiums are appropriately calculated according

to the implementation status of cybersecurity

measures. Based on this understanding, the

government will consider measures for promoting

the use of insurance in cybersecurity in

cooperation with private sectors.

###### [3] Enhancing Cybersecurity Business Supporting Innovation Utilizing
 Advanced Technology

The use of advanced technologies, such as IoT,

AI, VR, the blockchain, and next-generation

telecommunications technologies, is often

essential for enterprises to create new values. At

the same time, the use of these technologies


-----

presents new vulnerabilities that previously did

not exist, and malicious use of such technologies

may also lead to unexpected risks. For that

reason, there are expectations for realizing high

quality products or services related to

cybersecurity by estimating the risks beforehand

and including cybersecurity measures in the

processes of creating those products or services

(security by design). Furthermore, these

initiatives will lead not only to improved trust for

Japan’s products or services, but also to promoting

the overseas deployment of high quality

infrastructure that Japan is striving towards.

Meanwhile, due to a lack of expertise in

cybersecurity, it may not be possible for

enterprises to move forward with such initiatives

easily despite their intent to do so. In addition, it

is necessary from the perspective of enhancing

international competitivity, and avoiding reliance

on security products or services in which

authenticity and reliability are difficult to verify.

Therefore, there is a need to strengthen

cybersecurity businesses that provide specific

solutions domestically.

To meet these needs, the government will support

the challenges towards new value creation using

such advanced technologies not only by major

enterprises but also venture enterprises.

Specifically, the government will work in

cooperation with private sectors to analyze and

clarify cybersecurity risks associated with the use

of advanced technologies and to prepare and

disseminate guidelines based on such analysis

and clarification. In addition, the government will

promote research and development on risk

analysis and threat countermeasures for advanced

technologies required for these initiatives. It is

important to place the concept of security by

design at the foundation of these initiatives. The

government will also deliberate the building of

systems to match enterprises aiming to create

new values using advanced technologies with

providers of cybersecurity technologies or


services that support the use of those advanced

technologies.

Furthermore, in order to promote international

adoption of Japan’s products or services that have

achieved high levels of cybersecurity, the

government will promote the benefits of such

products or services through sales promotion by

top government officials and trade shows. It will

also work on the development of a business

environment that facilitates international

adoption by taking strict action through

international cooperation against measures

inhibiting free trade in the name of cybersecurity.

###### Achieving a Supply Chain that 4.1.2 Creates Values through Diverse Connections

As unification of cyberspace and real space

accelerates, previously nonexistent trade between

different industries and enterprises is occurring

on a global scale as we move towards Society 5.0.

Furthermore, diverse and fluid forms that go

beyond the traditional supply train are emerging,

such as the automation of trade. Given these new

forms, cybersecurity issues that occur at the edge

of these connections of supply chains have the

potential to spread more broadly than before and

cause massive negative effects not only to real

space but to the entire socioeconomic activities.

It is essential to be aware of these risks and to

promote initiatives that take the entire supply

chain into consideration.

###### [1] Formulating Cybersecurity Framework for supply chain risk

As the supply chain connections take more

diverse and fluid forms, it is essential for ensuring

cybersecurity to implement consistent measures

for the overall supply chain. It is also expected

that the quality of products or services will give

rise to new value creation through these

implementations.

|4.1.2|Achieving a Supply Chain that Creates Values through Diverse Connections|
|---|---|


-----

Specifically, the government will work in

cooperation with private sectors to clarify threats

in the supply chain and formulate as well as

disseminate frameworks that cut across industrial

categories for implementing operational-level

measures. In order for business operators

including small and medium-sized enterprises to

implement the measures easily, adequate

consideration will be given to ensure that the

contents of the guideline are both realistically

feasible and easy to understand, in light of

situation of their circumstances. It is also

important to ensure that business operators can

be aware of the balance between risks and costs

of countermeasures.

It is necessary to offer specific measures of each

sector required for IoT devices or organizations

with an awareness of connections, areas requiring

protection, and differences in threats related to

the supply chain in each industry sector.

Furthermore, as the supply chain expands

globally, it is necessary to reflect overseas trends

in the development of relevant rules so that

cybersecurity measures based on Japan’s security

frameworks will be recognized globally.

###### [2] Building a System to Confirm
 Cybersecurity in the Supply Chain

Securing the trustworthiness of the elements

comprising the supply chain including devices

being manufactured, the data generated and

distributed in devices, and the services that use

them is essential in securing cybersecurity for the

overall supply chain. To that end, it is necessary

for the government to work to clarify the

requirements and build a system that generates

trust by certifying that such requirements are

met. Consequently each element will be created

and distributed in a way that meets security

requirements. It is also necessary for the

government to work with the private sector to

build a system to create and manage a list of

devices and services for which trustworthiness


has been proven so that suppliers in the supply

chain can verify that trustworthiness when using

devices or equipment. The government will also

consider a system to verify traceability and a

system to detect and prevent attacks on the

generated trust itself so that these become

continuous systems within the connections of the

supply chain.

###### [3] Promoting Initiatives by Small and Medium-Sized Enterprises

When small and medium-sized enterprises suffer

financial damages and decline in trust due to

cyberattacks, impact on operations can be greater

than for major enterprises. There are also

concerns that small and medium-sized

enterprises can be used as footholds for

expanding the impacts of cyberattacks from the

company to its business partners. Meanwhile,

cybersecurity measures must be promoted with

the understanding that small and medium-sized

enterprises do not necessarily possess high level

knowledge or skills in cybersecurity, and it may

be difficult for them to adequately invest in

cybersecurity.

For that reason, the government will prepare

easy-to-understand case studies of cybersecurity

measures for small and medium-sized enterprises

that include models for the safe use of

information systems, and will promote the use of

insurance in cybersecurity. The government will

also strengthen the consultation system for small

and medium-sized enterprises on cybersecurity

incidents. Furthermore, the government will

promote visibility initiatives in cooperation with

private sectors for small and medium-sized

enterprises working on cybersecurity to promote

their efforts to the public on their own initiative.

The initiatives will include a systems to enable

them to carry out their cybersecurity efforts

effectively coordinated with incentive programs.


-----

|4.1.3|Building Secure IoT Systems39|
|---|---|


The number of devices connected to cyberspace

is rapidly expanding, and cybersecurity measures

for vulnerable things, which can negatively

impact cyberspace as essential infrastructure for

the development of socio-economic activities, has

become an urgent issue. Furthermore, as

connections grow between numerous things (IoT

devices) with different safety standards, including

security levels or physical security, those

connections have the potential to generate new

threats. Given this situation, the government

must work with private sectors to build secure IoT

systems.

###### [1] Improving Structural Framework for

 IoT Systems and International

 Standard

To date, the government has worked on

cybersecurity measures for IoT systems together

with private sectors by carrying out various

initiatives for realizing secure IoT systems,

including the creation of guidelines. Moving

forward, it is necessary to place emphasis on

value creation by secure IoT systems, and work

strategically with an integral and consistent

manner.

To that end, according to the basic elements40 of

cybersecurity required to realize secure IoT

systems presented so far by the government, the

government will cultivate a shared understanding

among stakeholders of the basic principles,

objectives, methods, and time limits of measures,

and clarify roles and functions of each sector or

stakeholder. In addition, the government will

promote initiatives in which each stakeholder

cooperates while promoting autonomous

cybersecurity measures. Furthermore, to promote


these initiatives, the government will work to

visualize the issues and associated initiatives of

each stakeholder in public and private sectors in a

manner that provides an overall picture, and build

a system for sharing information. These initiatives

will include not only sector-specific issues

weighing on the actors in the public and private

sectors but also common issues such as their

scope, definitions, physical safety measures,

demarcation points of responsibility (including

the legal responsibilities of each actor including

product liability of the manufacturers and the

safety management obligations of the operator,

etc. for incidents concerning the response to

known vulnerabilities), and privacy issues.

Furthermore, the government will work in

cooperation with private sectors to promote

efforts for international standardization of the

basic elements of cybersecurity required for

realizing secure IoT systems in order to develop

value creation systems for IoT systems and deploy

it on a global scale while utilizing Japan’s

strengths of safety and security in order to

contribute to the development of the global

economy through spreading such secure IoT

systems.

###### [2] Preparing a Formation for
 Vulnerability Countermeasures

To handle the increasing seriousness of

cyberattacks on IoT devices, it is important to

implement measures to ensure security and

trustworthiness of information and

communication networks, under the coordination

and division of roles between industry, academia,

and the public and private sectors. For that

reason, the government must work with private

sectors to prepare a formation for cybersecurity

measures that cover the entire lifecycle of IoT


39 A system in which everything including home electrical appliances, automobiles, and smart meters are connected to the Internet

and other networks, making it possible to provide new services by utilizing big data, etc. that it generates.

40 General Framework for Secure IoT Systems (October 2016, Cybersecurity Strategic Headquarters)


-----

devices from design and manufacturing through

operation to disposal, and for measures regarding

vulnerable IoT devices on information and

communication networks.

Cybersecurity measures for IoT devices that cover

the entire lifecycle should be implemented with

full consideration for how each device is used and

the relevant cybersecurity threats to it and the

state of overseas deliberations and technology

trends and developments. In addition, these

measures should be taken with the mutual

understanding and coordination of all

stakeholders such as IoT device providers,

telecommunications carriers, and users. As part of

this, the government will work with private

sectors to list cybersecurity requirements for each

IoT device based on its characteristics and

encourage the use of IoT devices that meet such

requirements.

Furthermore, regarding measures for vulnerable

IoT devices on information and communication

networks, the government will steadily improve

necessary systems to survey and identify IoT

devices that use flawed password and

expeditiously warn users thereof by

telecommunication carriers. In addition, when

implementing measures, related ministries and

government agencies will work together and

coordinate with telecommunication carriers and

device manufacturers.

In the future, the government intends to

contribute to establishing a safe environment by

improving global information and

communication networks by taking these

Japanese measures as models and expanding

them overseas through international coordination

and standardization.

|4.2.1|Measures for the Protection of the People and Society|
|---|---|

|4.2|Building a Safe and Secure Society for the People|
|---|---|


For the realization of society in which the people

can live safely and securely, it is important to

ensure multi-layered cybersecurity, through the

coordination of multi-stakeholders, including

governmental bodies, local governments, cyber
related enterprises, critical infrastructure

operators, educational and research institutions,

and every people themselves.

In particular, operations and services provided by

governmental bodies, critical infrastructure

operators, industry associations, and local

governments (hereinafter referred to as critical

infrastructure operators etc.) form the foundation

that supports smooth socio-economic activities

and people’s living. Given the understanding that

it is impossible to completely eliminate risks of

cybersecurity, the government will promote

initiatives based on the “mission assurance”

approach declared under the basic vision of

cybersecurity in order to reduce risks to an

acceptable level and ensure that these operations

and services are provided safely and continuously.

Meanwhile, Japan is preparing for national and

international sporting events such as the Rugby

World Cup 2019 and the Tokyo 2020 Games,

which can be expected to provide incentives for

cyberattacks to malicious actors. Thus, it is

necessary for each stakeholder to deal with each

situation by steadily carrying out their respective

roles and cooperating with each other to realize a

smooth implementation of the Tokyo 2020

Games and other events while also looking

further ahead to the future.

41 Initiative that defends proactively against cyberattacks.


With increasing threats to cyberspace, many

people have developed a feeling of anxiety about

cybercrime, leading to an increase in awareness

of cybersecurity throughout the society. Given

these conditions, it is essential for all stakeholders

to autonomously raise their security awareness

and work proactively while creating an

environment where multi-layered cybersecurity is

ensured in collaboration among stakeholders.

###### [1] Building a Safe and Secure Cyber Environment for Users

Because cybercrime and cyberattacks are

becoming more sophisticated and complex, and

types of attacks are diversifying, they can no

longer be handled using traditional passive

measures only, and more proactive measures

than what were previously used must be

implemented.

Given this situation, the government, cooperating

with cyber-related enterprises, will promote the

policy of “Proactive Cyber Defense41” that ensures

the government to implement active preventive

measures against threats in advance. Specifically,

the government will work to promote such

initiatives to prevent damages from cybercrime or

cyberattacks such as promoting the sharing and

utilization of threat information to enable

preemptive defense, using technologies to induce

attacks to collect information on attackers, and

conducting measures against botnets.42

The government will also promote the

development of dependable information

infrastructure, including the reinforcement of

international undersea cables and other

infrastructure facilities, which will be the

-----

foundation of overall services provided by

governmental bodies and critical infrastructure

operators, etc. The government will consider how

to verify the evaluation of trustworthiness and

how to improve the practice of government

procurement and press forward with measures.

Furthermore, the government will work with

providers of cryptocurrency services to promote

measures so that the people may safely engage in

the trading of cryptocurrencies. Also, with regard

to self-driving vehicles and drones, the

government will promote measures to avoid the

occurrence of unauthorized operations due to

cyberattacks as they may cause risks to human

life. With regard to self-driving vehicles in

particular, the government will continue to take

the lead in the ongoing debate in the

international forums on the establishment of

international standards for cybersecurity.

###### [2] Enhancing Measures against

 Cybercrimes

As cyberspace increasingly becomes part of

people’s living, cybercrime has become a serious

social issue due to the occurrence of global scale

damages from ransomware infections43 and cases

in which unauthorized transmission of large

monetary amounts apparently was carried out

against domestic cryptocurrency exchange

operators by malicious actors. In order to ensure

the safety and security of the people, the

government will continue to work to grasp the

actual state of cybercrime and promote a

crackdown on such crime while cooperating with

related institutions or organizations in carrying

out public awareness campaigns getting each

individual person to promote autonomous

measures against cybercrime. Furthermore,

improvement of investigative and technological

capabilities is also essential for addressing new


types of cybercrime.

To that end, the government continues to

promote thorough investigative activities,

consideration on new investigative techniques,

and public awareness campaigns to prevent

damages from cybercrime. For the purpose of

dealing with crime where advanced information

and communication technologies are used, the

government will strengthen its digital forensics

capabilities, enhancing the technological prowess

to analyze the latest in digital devices or

malicious software, and advancing comprehensive

analysis for predicting threats to cyberspace and

for unraveling those threats technologically. The

government will also promote positive utilization

of knowledge and experience of private

enterprises, personnel exchange between public

and private sectors, and countermeasures against

cybercrime in which, in the light of information

sharing, information analysis, prevention of

damages due to cybercrime, and human resource

development, public and private sectors

collaborate each other.

In the event of cybercrime, it is necessary to

ensure traceability in cyberspace for investigation.

As cooperation with related business operators

and international collaboration is essential for

this, the government will implement any

necessary initiatives for that purpose. Regarding

the appropriate preservation of communications

history data logs in particular, the government,

on the basis of the relevant guidelines,44 will get

related business operators to take appropriate

measure.

###### Protection of Critical 4.2.2 Infrastructure through Public and Private Sector Cooperation

Regarding the protection of critical infrastructure,

|---|---|


43 A type of malware (short for malicious software) that encrypts data and then demands a ransom.

44 Explanation of the "Guidelines on the Protection of Personal Information in the Telecommunications Business.”


-----

the government has implemented initiatives

based on the set of five policy groups of the

Cybersecurity Policy for Critical Infrastructure

Protection (4th Edition)45 (hereinafter referred to

as the “Cybersecurity Policy”), based on the

concept of “mission assurance” to provide critical

infrastructure services safely and continuously.46

However, the issue remains that there are

variations in the level of cybersecurity awareness

and progress in initiatives between each critical

infrastructure sector. In order to solve these

issues, it is necessary to raise the overall level of

cybersecurity. Accordingly, the government will

work with private sectors to provide proactive

support as each stakeholder works on its own

autonomous initiatives, including the

consideration of models for cybersecurity

measures regarding critical infrastructure

operators with limited management resources for

which it is difficult to adequately invest in

cybersecurity.

###### [1] Primary Initiatives Based on the

 “Cybersecurity Policy”

To date, the government has formulated and

revised the “Cybersecurity Policy” for the

protection of critical infrastructure, and it will

continue to implement initiatives based on the

“Cybersecurity Policy.” The “Cybersecurity Policy”

is scheduled for review following the Tokyo 2020

Games. However, it will be reviewed even prior to

the scheduled date if necessary, if there are major

changes in the direction of society.

Critical infrastructure sectors are designated from

the perspective of particularly requiring

protection in consideration of degrees of impact

they have on people’s living and socio-economic

activities. In view of social conditions, the

government will expand the scope of critical

infrastructure sectors and operators to develop

45 Cybersecurity Strategic Headquarters Decision on April 18, 2017


the scope of security initiatives and strengthen

“protection as a plane,” as necessary. At the same

time, it will further promote initiatives to share

information, and expand or enhance information

sharing systems.

Furthermore, the active involvement of senior

executives officials at critical infrastructure

operators is essential to promote initiatives for

protecting critical infrastructure. Accordingly, the

government will reach out to the senior

executives to raise their awareness of

cybersecurity while promoting the following

initiatives.

###### (i) Promotion of Risk Management

It is necessary to provide critical infrastructure

services safely and continuously even during

cyberattacks. For that reason, in addition to

implementing security measures in advance, it is

important for critical infrastructure operators to

prepare business continuity plans (BCP) and

contingency plans based on the concept of

mission assurance, in light of the results of risk

assessment with cross-organizational and

complex risks in mind. The government will

implement initiatives to ensure that these overall

risk management activities function continuously

and effectively.

###### (ii) Improvement and Promotion of Safety Principles

In order to promote appropriate handling by

critical infrastructure operators, the government

will work on further promotion of guidelines for

the preparation of safety principles, while

continuously promoting initiatives to improve

those safety principles including the

recommendation of methods for data

management and reduction of risks due to human

factors based on surveys on the current state of


46 These are the Maintenance and Promotion of the Safety Principles, Enhancement of Information Sharing System, Enhancement of

Incident Response Capability, Risk Management and Preparation of Incident Readiness, and Enhancement of the Basis for CIP.


-----

data management and relevant international

trends, taking into consideration such matters as

the content of the business, size of the

organizations, the duration of system use, and the

impact on international competitivity.

Furthermore, from the standpoint of maintaining

safety, the government will appropriately improve

the institutional frameworks by means such as

positioning cybersecurity measures as safety

regulations within related laws and regulations,

etc.

###### (iii) NISC Cyber Incident Severity Scale for CIS Outages

According to recent trends in cyberattacks, it is

necessary to enable stakeholders, such as

governmental bodies and critical infrastructure

operators, to quickly share their understanding

and determine whether a rapid response is

necessary when a cyberattack is detected. To that

end, the government will prepare the “NISC Cyber

Incident Severity Scale for CIS Outages” and

evaluate and publish the severity of incidents to

encourage and enable diverse stakeholders to

respond rationally and appropriately while taking

into consideration the effect and impact of

thoroughly informing the public. The government

will also review the Scale as appropriate to

improve it.

###### （iv） Joint Training and Exercises between Public and Private Sectors

It is important to conduct training and exercises

with the assumption of the occurrence of service

outages to increase the capabilities of critical

infrastructure operators so that they can respond

to such situations appropriately. The government

and related institutions will continue to

implement training and exercises among

stakeholders of various sizes across public and

private sector boundaries, and expand the scope

and improve the contents thereof as necessary for

their continued development.

###### (v) Security Measures for Industrial Control Systems (ICS)

There are critical infrastructure operators in such

sectors as electricity, gas, and oil that use

industrial control systems (ICS) to provide

services. In these cases, it is likely that normal

service provision becomes impossible when such

ICS are significantly affected by cyberattacks and

the like, causing a major impact on people’s

living. Accordingly, public and private sectors will

unite to promote human resource development

regarding ICS and carry out collection, analysis,

and deployment of threat information as

appropriate so that adequate security measures

based on the characteristics of ICS will be

implemented for safe and continuous provision of

services.

###### [2] Strengthening and Enhancing

 Security in Local Governments

The services provided by local governments are

closely related to people’s living, and any

obstacles on the provision of those services can

have a major impact on community activity.

While there are limits to technical solutions that

can be taken for cybersecurity measures

individually by organizations with limited

resources, it is first and foremost necessary to

implement countermeasures against the leak of

information, including Indivisual Number, due to

service interruption or human error.

Given this situation and while direct involvement47

of the national government in local government

is limited compared to other organizations due to

the current division of roles between national and

local governments, local governments nationwide

have been undertaking the fundamental

reinforcement of measures, and the national


-----

government will update its guideline on security

policy as necessary in light of the necessity to

achieve a high level of security. The government

will also work to achieve the necessary security

levels for operational networks and promote

initiatives to secure and develop cybersecurity

human resource, enhance systems as well as

securing the necessary budget while being

mindful of the need for smooth operations by

local governments.

Furthermore, with regards to identity federation

among public and private sectors, the

government will work to improve the

environment balancing between convenience and

security.

###### Strengthening and Improving 4.2.3 Security in Governmental Bodies and Government-Related Entities

To date, efforts have been made to raise the level

of information security measures for

governmental bodies overall through the

development of information security measures

based on unified standards, initiatives for auditing

based on those standards and the monitoring of

unauthorized communication, and the

government is required to continue working on

these initiatives. The framework for initiatives at

Incorporated Administrative Agencies and

Designated Corporations (hereinafter referred to

as “Incorporated Administrative Agencies, etc.”)

has been expanded in the same manner as for

governmental bodies through the revision of the

Basic Act on Cybersecurity,48 and it will be an

important issue moving forward to promote

effective information security measures at

Incorporated Administrative Agencies, etc. in

consideration of the characteristics of their

diverse business forms.


Responding to increasingly complex and

sophisticated cyberattacks, there is a need to use

new technologies to overcome the existing state

in which attackers have the advantage while

strengthening defense in depth that assume

attacks will occur and countermeasures for risks

to supply chains.

The smooth execution of government services is

an extremely important responsibility for

governmental bodies and Incorporated

Administrative Agencies, etc. (hereinafter referred

to as “the Agencies”), and it is important to make

the necessary IT investment and security-related

investment together as one when making

investments for their systems. In light of this

situation, it is important to secure the funds

necessary to amplify security-related investments

by such means as using the funds generated by

making IT investment by the Agencies more

efficient for security, and to strengthen the

information security measures described above.

###### [1] Advancing and Visualizing Security

 Measures for Information Systems

The Agencies will utilize new defensive

technologies to carry out more effective

initiatives, aiming not only to increase the

response capability towards the growing threat of

cyberattacks, but also to prevent damages and, in

the case of the occurrence of damages, prevent its

spread and minimize the damage.

###### (i) Increasing Defensive Capabilities
 and Conditional Awareness for Information Systems

The Agencies will work to prevent damage

preemptively and prevent its spread thereof by

detecting malware behavior at the endpoint

(personal computer, etc.) where programs are

run. By automation of IT asset management, the

|---|---|


48 Enacted on April 15, 2016. Expanded the scope to cover the monitoring, auditing, and investigating the causes of unauthorized

communications by the government.


-----

Agencies will monitor the state of information

systems in real time and enable the rapid

handling of software vulnerabilities. Data

protection initiatives will also be carried out for

all Agencies to prevent information leakage when

incidents occur. Furthermore, it is necessary to

examine measures for identifying attacks that are

difficult to detect by analyzing threat, combining

the phenomena that occur on various devices and

account management information. In order to

implement those measures effectively, systems

with a view to automating the work required for

analysis of information must be established.

###### (ii) Preventing Damages and the Spread Thereof through the Advanced

 Cross-Organizational Collaboration

 among the Agencies

With consideration for the implementation status

of malware monitoring on devices and

automation of IT asset management at all stages,

including prevention, detection, recovery, and

response, the Agencies will aim for the

development of cross-organizational initiatives by

sophistication of effective and efficient

collaboration between the Agencies and the

GSOC49 which includes the appropriate sharing

with the GSOC of information to be gained on

such measures.

###### [2] Promoting Use of the Cloud for Effective Security Measures

So that each Agency can select an appropriate

form of information system according to the

characteristics of the information and that

security measures can be carried out efficiently

and effectively for the overall government, the

government will promote the use of cloud

services including migration to a government

common platform in the form of a government


private cloud that can utilize the benefits of

consolidating the building and operation of

systems and increasing the security level. In

promoting the use of the cloud, the government

will consider and go forward with measures to

promote the use of a reliable cloud in which an

appropriate level of security such as safety

evaluation is secured.

With regard to the Internet connection lines, the

government has also worked for the unification

and consolidation of the connection port under

the common standard. The government will make

the necessary considerations including the

consolidation of perimeter monitoring points

while collaborating with government common

networks and platforms, since the further

promotion of the appropriate consolidation of

Internet connection ports for governmental

bodies is extremely effective for operations and

security measures.

###### [3] Preemptive Efforts Utilizing

 Advanced Technology

Some of the information system platforms that

have grown in use in recent years have a

particularly high level of resistance to

cyberattacks. The government will consider

utilizing the information technologies created

under this new design philosophy for the

Agencies, work to accumulate knowledge of best

practices, and aim for a shift towards defender’s

advantage.

###### [4] Raising the Cybersecurity Level through Auditing

In light of the Basic Act on Cybersecurity, the

government will provide the trends and issues

identified through the cross-organizational

analysis of data from the auditing of the Agencies

as feedback for the entire Agencies to promote

rapid response for the information security of governmental bodies.


-----

the further raising of the cybersecurity level. In

addition, the government will utilize the IT asset

management information of the Agencies that is

developed in accordance with initiatives in

monitoring the state of those systems efficiently,

and will aim for efficient and effective

implementation of auditing.

###### [5] Improving Organizational Response Capability

Primarily via the team that handles incidents,50

the government will increase incident response

capability and information security knowledge of

each Agency. In case of occurrences of

cyberattacks to the Agencies, the government will

enhance the training, etc. for coping capability

building of the staff in order to strengthen the

mobile assistance formation (an emergency

assistance team for information security)51 which

is comprised of government employees with

requisite knowledge and skills of each

government agency.

###### Ensuring a Safe and Secure 4.2.4 Educational and Research Environment at Universities etc.

Universities and Inter-University Research

Institutes etc. (hereinafter referred to as

“universities etc.”) are staffed by various

members with a diverse collection of IT assets

and systems in use. Given the nature of these

universities etc., along with the implementation

of autonomous cybersecurity measures by the

universities etc. by themselves, it is important for

the government to proactively support the

building of response system and sharing of

information etc. to deal with cyberattacks through

collaboration among the universities etc. in order

to ensure a safe and secure educational and

50 CSIRT (Computer Security Incident Response Team)

51 CYMAT (Cyber Incident Mobile Assistant Team)


research environment.

###### [1] Promoting Measures in Light of the Diversity of Universities etc.

The senior executives of universities etc. must

personally understand the importance of

cybersecurity measures, position cybersecurity

measures as important managerial issues, and

carry out initiatives as an organization based on a

plan for promoting cybersecurity measures, while

also conducting follow-ups to further promote

cybersecurity measures.

In doing so, it is necessary to identify the IT assets

to protect, evaluate the cybersecurity risks, and

consider the managerial and technical measures

to be prioritized when implementing in

accordance to those risks, with consideration for

the diversity of the universities etc. that conduct

education and research in various areas.

Furthermore, universities and research institutes

also need to consider initiatives to improve the

capability to respond quickly and appropriately to

incidents, and a system to implement the

measures organizationally and steadily.

The government will promote the autonomous

and organizational initiatives of the universities

etc. by creating and disseminating guidelines on

cybersecurity; implementing practice for each

level regarding risk management and incident

response, and practical training and exercises, and

support for the initial response to the event of

incidents.

###### [2] Promoting Cooperative and Collaborative Initiatives by Universities etc.

Universities etc. use common information

platforms and face similar cybersecurity issues.

Strengthening of the cybersecurity measures in

light of these actual conditions at the universities

|4.2.4|Ensuring a Safe and Secure Educational and Research Environment at Universities etc.|

-----

etc. is considered important, and there is a need

for further promotion of initiatives through

mutual cooperation of all the parties involved.

For this reason, organizations that operate science

information networks will collaborate with

national universities etc. to develop a system to

monitor, detect, and analyze cyberattacks and

provide information on those attacks, while also

carrying out joint research and training for

technical staff to maintain and strengthen the

functions of monitoring capabilities and develop

strategic management level, and training for

technical staff.

In order to strengthen the incident response team

at those universities etc., the government will also

support initiatives that the incident handling

team for multiple universities and research

institutes shares information, common issues and

knowledge for incident response related to

cyberattacks.

###### 4.2.5 [Initiatives for the Tokyo 2020 ] Games and Beyond

Countless athletes, foreign dignitaries, and

supporters will gather from all over the world for

the Olympic/Paralympic Games, giving the

hosting of the event the highest possible level of

attention and potentially making it a target for

cyberattacks.

Reflecting on the past Olympic/Paralympic

Games, it has been reported that there was a

massive number of cyberattacks during the

London 2012 Games, though they did not affect

the operation of the event. Similarly, according to

some reports there was a significant number of

cyberattacks causing damages to the Rio de

Janeiro 2016 Games and the PyeongChang 2018

Games. The Tokyo 2020 Games is also expected

to be subject to even more cyberattacks than in


the past and, by their nature, some attacks will

assumingly be targeting multiple service sectors.

For that reason, the government will ensure

cybersecurity for the Tokyo 2020 Games and

promote further measures looking beyond the

event.

These various measures will be expanded in

scope and continued after the Tokyo 2020 Games,

and the legacy of the systems developed, and

experience and knowledge in their operation will

be utilized to strengthen cybersecurity in Japan

continuously into the future.

###### [1] Preparedness for the Tokyo 2020 Games

Based on the basic strategy52 decided by the

Security Board Meeting of the Headquarters for

the Tokyo 2020 Olympic/Paralympic Games, the

government will continue the collection of

information concerning the safety of the Games

and other measures. It will also carry out the

assessment of cybersecurity risk sources taking

into consideration the coordination with physical

security, conduct the cybersecurity risk

assessment of critical service providers that have

the potential to affect the Tokyo 2020 Games

operations including the consideration of risk

scenarios based on the results of the assessment

of cybersecurity risk sources, and promote

measures for various risks including the cross
sectoral risks identified by the risk assessment. In

addition to the sharing of information on

cybersecurity threats among Olympic related

organizations, such as the relevant ministries and

governmental agencies, the Tokyo Organising

Committee of the Olympic and Paralympic

Games, the Tokyo Metropolitan Government,

local governments providing venues, and critical

service providers, the government will promote

the development of the Cyber Security Incident

Response Coordination Center (Government

Olympic/Paralympic CSIRT), the organization

through which the government takes a role to

coordinate the Olympic related organizations so

that they can respond to cybersecurity incidents

together when an incident occurs, and work to

ensure the preparedness for close communication

and coordination.

###### [2] Passing on Results that Lead to the Future

The government will continue to promote the

various measures in preparation for the Tokyo

2020 Games, and the systems developed, and the

operational experience and knowledge of those

systems will be utilized as a legacy to strengthen

Japan’s continuous cybersecurity after the Tokyo

2020 Games. Furthermore, the Cyber Security

Incident Response Coordination Center will be

utilized as an organization (national CSIRT) to

serve as a coordinator and coordinating desk for

all of Japan to work together to deal with

cyberattacks. The methods for risk management

described in the Basic Vision of Cybersecurity will

be prepared and disseminated for wide

application to business operators throughout the

country.

###### Building an Information Sharing/ 4.2.6 Collaboration Framework that Extends beyond Traditional Frameworks

Essentially, the establishment of cybersecurity

should be an initiative that each organization

carries out autonomously according to the value

of its data assets and the state of information and

communication technology utilization.

Meanwhile, due to the changes in attack modes,

there has been a limit to the ability to put in place

effective countermeasures against cyberattacks

within a single organization. For that reason, an


awareness is steadily spreading in both the public

and private sectors that emphasizes collaboration

with other organizations, and not only

administrative organs and critical infrastructure

operators, but also a wide range of other

stakeholders are beginning to work on

information sharing.

As the number of sectors closely related to

cyberspace further grows due to the increasing

unification of cyberspace and real space, it is

expected that the scope of sectors and

stakeholders that need to share information

contributing cybersecurity will continue to

expand.

Accordingly, from the standpoint of

“participation, coordination and collaboration”

presented as part of the Basic Vision of

Cybersecurity, the government must support

existing initiatives for information sharing

systems, such as ISAC,53 through the close

coordination between the stakeholders, while

taking on new roles.

###### [1] Promoting Information Sharing and

 Collaboration between Multi
 Stakeholders

With the increase in the number of stakeholders

engaged in information sharing, the importance

of the role of collecting and analyzing the

information and coordinating the stakeholders in

a timely manner also increases. In the meantime,

because the inappropriate handling of the shared

information has the potential to cause a decline

in the social appraisal and trust, it remains an

issue that the stakeholders are reluctant to

proactively share the data they possess.

Given this situation, the government will work to

build a new system that will enable multi
stakeholders in the public and private sectors,

including specialized agencies with adequate

-----

knowledge and experience in information

sharing, to share information contributing

cybersecurity without anxiety. When doing so, it

will be important to respect the autonomy of

each stakeholder in accordance with the principle

of autonomy presented in the Basic Principles.

Information sharing and coordination that

transcends public-private, industrial, national,

and other boundaries between public and private

sectors, industries, and the domestic and

international will be promoted by implementing

this initiative.

The government will also consider collaboration

and unification between the multiple existing

information sharing systems in the public and

private sectors with consideration for the

characteristics and roles of each of them so that

the relevant parties shall not incur additional

burden by new system.

###### [2] Towards a New Stage in Information

 Sharing and Collaboration

For the development of a new information

sharing system, the government will consider a

structure in which multi-stakeholders can build

relationships of trust, and in which the more they

actively collaborate and cooperate in providing

information, the more they receive benefit from

the system.

The more the level of collaboration and

cooperation with other parties increases, the

greater the benefits of participating in the

information sharing system become. Accordingly,

the government must take the lead in sharing the

information in its possession appropriately. The

government will also develop an environment in

which stakeholders that proactively share their

own information regarding such matters as

cybersecurity incidents is positively regarded. In

particular, it is essential that information

regarding cybersecurity that causes recalls to

protect the life and physical well-being of people

is shared swiftly and surely. The government will


also work to achieve appropriate and swift

analysis and sharing of information truly needed

by each stakeholder through the promotion of

automatic processing of received information and

other means.

Through this initiative, the understanding that

the mutual sharing of information is essential to

increase cybersecurity will be cultivated

throughout society. Furthermore, having the sight

set on the strategic collaboration with the

international community is also essential, while

developing Japan’s information sharing system.

The government will work closely with each

stakeholder and work proactively towards

improving the necessary environment to enable

each stakeholder to build relationships for

coexistence and mutual development that

transcend the conventional sectoral boundaries

associated with industries and the public and

private sectors. This will enable the sharing of

information and collaboration regarding

cybersecurity to move ahead to a new stage.

###### Strengthening the Incident 4.2.7 Readiness Against Massive Cyberattacks

Cyberattacks have occurred overseas and

significantly impacted people’s living, causing

massive power outages or partial losses of

functioning of financial institutions. As

unification of cyberspace and real space

continues, it is well within the realm of possibility

for cyberattacks to cause incidents in real space in

our country in the future. Furthermore, massive

cyberattacks can be expected to cause

simultaneous damages to services that are

normally relatively unrelated, and the country

must work as one to address risk management for

threats in cyberspace to protect society and the

people from those threats.

The government will carry out response training

and exercises across both cyberspace and real

space while strengthening the preparations to

respond to cyberattacks through training and

exercises in order to work on risk management

for both cyberspace and real space. The

government will also promote training of

personnel capable of analyzing cyberattacks, the

sharing of information through a framework for

public and private sector coordination, and the

advancement of Internet monitoring in an effort

to improve data collection and analysis

capabilities and emergency response capabilities

in cyberspace.

|4.3|Contribution to the Peace and Stability of the International Community and Japan’s National Security|
|---|---|


A free, fair, and secure cyberspace contributes to

the peace and stability of the international

community and to Japan’s national security.

A cyberspace, which is open to all actors and

where the autonomous and free flow of

information is secured, fosters innovation and

constitutes the foundation of democracy.

Cyberspace has developed through technological

innovations, inventions, and initiatives of multi
stakeholders in industry, academia, and the

public and private sectors. Excessive control by

states will impede the autonomous and

sustainable development of cyberspace. For the

sound development of cyberspace, multi
stakeholders need to cooperate to ensure the free

flow of information, and maintain the openness

and autonomy of cyberspace.

As the use of cyberspace accelerates throughout

society, leading to the advancement of the

unification of cyberspace and real space, the

issues in real space, such as human rights, privacy,

crime and terrorism, and national security, are

brought into the realm of cyberspace and posing

challenges. Accordingly, it is necessary to carry

out initiatives with regard to these challenges to

ensure the safety and security of cyberspace.

Since cyberattacks can easily cross national

borders and there are incidents that are suspected

of being state-sponsored, it is necessary to

promote the rule of law, increase defense,

deterrence, and situational awareness capabilities

against cyberattacks and promote international

cooperation and collaboration in order to ensure

the security and stability of cyberspace. However,

when doing so, it is necessary to pay attention in

order to avoid impeding the autonomous and

sustainable development of cyberspace.

In order to safeguard a free, fair, and secure


cyberspace, Japan will communicate its position

in the international fora, ensure its national

security by utilizing existing frameworks, and

promote international collaboration.

###### 4.3.1 [Commitment to a Free, Fair, ] and Secure Cyberspace

In order to realize a free, fair, and secure

cyberspace at the global level, Japan will

communicate its idea in the international fora

and take an active role in promoting the rule of

law in cyberspace.

###### [1] Communicating the Ideas of a Free, Fair, and Secure Cyberspace

In order to maintain the ecosystem of

autonomously and sustainably developing

cyberspace, Japan will aim to ensure the safety in

cyberspace through the coordination and

collaboration among multi-stakeholders on

efforts to ensure cybersecurity, rather than

through control and regulation such as

controlling the flow of information by states.

Japan will communicate such basic approach to

cybersecurity in the international fora. In

addition, Japan will work with our ally and like
minded countries, as well as private entities to

thwart any efforts that aim to inhibit the

development of cyberspace such as through the

change of international rules.

In doing so, it is necessary to separate discussions

on how to manage Internet resources from

discussions of the issues that arise through the

use of cyberspace such as human rights, privacy,

crime and terrorism, and national security. With

regard to the issues that arise through the use of

cyberspace, discussions need to be conducted

under the premise of the existing frameworks.

###### [2] Promoting the Rule of Law in
 Cyberspace

The promotion of the rule of law is important for

|4.3.1|Commitment to a Free, Fair, and Secure Cyberspace|
|---|---|


-----

the peace and stability of the international

community and Japan’s national security.

Existing international law, including the Charter

of the United Nations, applies to cyberspace also.

Japan takes this position and will proactively

contribute to discussions on the individual and

specific applications of existing international law

and the development and universalization of

norms. Also, Japan will promote the

universalization of norms of behavior of

responsible states that have been apparent to

date54 by steady implementation and practice of

such norms. Japan will deter any acts against such

norms through the universalization of such norms

in the international community and the

accumulation of relevant state practices thereof.

With regard to measures against cybercrime, the

National Police Agency and other relevant

ministries and agencies will collaborate to further

promote international partnership through

international investigative cooperation and

information sharing with international

organizations, law enforcement agencies and

security information agencies in foreign countries

leveraging frameworks such as the Convention on

Cybercrime, mutual legal assistance treaties, and

the ICPO.55

Through these initiatives, Japan will promote the

rule of law and realize the peace and stability of

the international community and Japan’s national

security.

###### Strengthening Capabilities for 4.3.2 Defense, Deterrence, and Situational Awareness

The security environment in cyberspace is

growing increasingly severer. Cyberattacks have

been taking place against governmental bodies,


critical infrastructure operators, companies and

academic and research institutions possessing

advanced technologies. There are cases that

might threaten to undermine the foundations of

democracy. Furthermore, some of these attacks

are suspected of being state-sponsored.

Given this situation, in order to protect the Japan’s

national security interests from cyberattacks, it is

important to secure Japan’s resilience against

cyberattacks and increase Japan’s ability to defend

the state (defense capabilities), deter

cyberattacks (deterrence capabilities), and be

aware of the situation in cyberspace (situational

awareness capabilities).

All relevant public and private stakeholders led by

the National center of Incident readiness and

Strategy for Cybersecurity with regard to defense,

the ministries and agencies responsible for

response measures with regard to deterrence, and

information gathering and investigative

organizations with regard to situational

awareness will closely cooperate on a daily basis

and proceed with the initiatives related to

national security, under the overall coordination

by the National Security Secretariat. When

necessary, deliberation and decision will be made

at the National Security Council.

###### [1] Ensuring National Resilience
 (i) Mission Assurance

It is the mission of governmental bodies to

protect and support people’s lives and socio
economic activities. Any failure in playing their

role is a significant concern for national security.

The execution of the missions of these

governmental bodies relies on the services

provided by critical infrastructure operators and

other business operators which maintain social

system. These operators also have an important

|4.3.2|Strengthening Capabilities for Defense, Deterrence, and Situational Awareness|
|---|---|


54 These include the 2015 report of the fourth session of the United Nations Group of Governmental Experts on Developments in the

Field of Information and Telecommunications in the Context of International Security (UN GGE), the 2015 G20 Antalya Summit

Leaders’ Communiqué, and the 2017 G7 Declaration on Responsible States Behavior in Cyberspace.

55 ICPO is the Acronym for International Criminal Police Organization.


-----

mission to provide these services indispensable

for the people and the society.

Japan will promote the establishment of

cybersecurity for governmental bodies and critical

infrastructure operators in order to assure the

execution of the missions of those governmental

bodies related to national security and to provide

services essential for the people and the society.

As the defense authorities, in particular, the

Ministry of Defense and the Self-Defense Forces,

will continue to strengthen the defense of the

networks and infrastructure on which their

operations depend, while further enhancing the

capabilities of cyber defense units against

cyberattacks, and deepen collaboration with

stakeholders involved in the mission assurance of

the Self-Defense Forces.

###### (ii) Protection of Japan’s Advanced

 Technologies and Defense Related

 Technologies

Advanced technologies are important national

assets not only for assuring economic advantage,

but for national security as well. Japan will

strengthen cybersecurity measures, including the

reduction of human caused risks faced by the

business operators and relevant ministries and

governmental agencies that handle the

technologies important to Japan’s national

security, such as technologies related to outer

space, nuclear energy, security, and the defense

equipment. Particularly, the leak or illegal

disclosure of the technical information held by

the defense industry would have a major impact

on Japan’s national security. For that reason,

Japan will work to adopt a system to ensure the

safe sharing of information, establish new

information security standards for contractors,

and revise contractual provisions. Deliberations

will be carried out with the assumption that these

measures will be applied to the entire supply

chain for the defense industry, including

subcontractors, through the collaboration


between the public and private sectors.

Furthermore, the government will promote

measures at national research and development

organizations and universities and research

institutes possessing advanced technology from

the viewpoint of protecting information on

advanced technologies.

###### (iii) Measures Against the Malicious Use of Cyberspace by Terrorist Organizations

Cyberspace offers a place where individuals and

organizations can exchange information and

express their thoughts freely. It now serves as the

foundations of democracy. On the other hand, it

is necessary to prevent the malicious use of

cyberspace by terrorist organizations, such as

spreading and demonstrating violent externism,

recruiting into the organizations, and gathering

funds for organizations. For that reason, the

government will strengthen the collection and

analysis of information on the activities of

terrorist organizations in cyberspace and take any

other necessary measures in collaboration with

the international community, while also

guaranteeing the basic human rights including

the freedom of expression.

###### [2] Enhancing Deterrence Capabilities
 (i) Measures for Effective Deterrence

International law, including the Charter of the

United Nations, applies to cyberspace. As G7

leaders affirmed at the Ise-Shima Summit, under

some circumstances, cyber activities could

amount to the use of force or an armed attack

within the meaning of international law.56 Also, as

G7 foreign ministers affirmed at Lucca, among

other lawful responses, a State that is the victim

of an internationally wrongful act may, in certain

circumstances, resort to proportionate

countermeasures against the State responsible for

the wrongful act.57

Based on the above-mentioned recognition, in


-----

order to deter malicious cyber activities and

protect the people’s safety, security, and rights, in

close coordination with our ally and like-minded

countries, Japan will utilize political, economic,

technological, legal, diplomatic, and all other

viable and effective means and capabilities,

depending on the threat, and take resolute

responses against cyber threats that undermine

our national security, including those possibly

state-sponsored.

The government will strengthen the coordination

system among relevant governmental bodies with

the Cabinet Secretariat as its core in order to

make timely and appropriate responses, promote

as a whole inter-agency and cross-sectoral efforts

in a comprehensive manner, and the government

will also strengthen capacity at the relevant

authorities including law enforcement authorities

and the Self-Defense Forces. In this regard, the

acquisition of capabilities to prevent malicious

cyber actors from using cyberspace may be

considered.

###### (ii) Confidence Building Measures

The government will work to build confidence

among states in order to prevent the occurrence

of unforeseen circumstances and deterioration of

the situation caused by cyberattacks. Due to the

the anonymity and secrecy of cyberattacks, there

are risks that cyberattacks unintentionally

increase tentions among states and worsen the

situation. In order to prevent such accidental and

unnecessary confrontations, it is important to


build up international communication channels

during normal times in preparation for the

occurrence of incidents that extend beyond

national borders. It is also necessary to increase

transparency and build confidence between states

through the proactive information exchange and

policy dialogues in bilateral and multilateral

consultations. The government will also

cooperate with other states to consider a

mechanism for coordinating issues regarding

cyberspace.

###### [3] Strengthening Cyber Situational Awareness
 (i) Increasing the Capabilities of Relevant Governmental Bodies

In order to deter increasingly serious cyberattack,

in addition to enhancing response capabilities,

adequate capabilities to detect, investigate, and

analyze cyberattacks are necessary to make the

attackers accountable. To this end, the

government will quantitatively and qualitatively

improve the information collection and analysis

capabilities of the relevant governmental bodies.

Accordingly, the government will proceed with

wide ranging considerations of any effective

means including the development and

securement of a cybersecurity human resource

with high-level analytical capabilities, and

development and utilization of technologies for

detecting, investigating, and analyzing

cyberattacks. The government will also carry out

initiatives related to counter-cyber intelligence.58


56 G7 Principles and Actions on Cyber (May 2016) “We affirm that under some circumstances, cyber activities could amount to the use

of force or an armed attack within the meaning of the United Nations Charter and customary international law. We also recognize

that states may exercise their inherent right of individual or collective self-defense as recognized in Article 51 of the United Nations

Charter and in accordance with international law, including international humanitarian law, in response to an armed attack through

cyberspace.”

57 G7 Declaration on Responsible States Behavior in Cyberspace (April 2017) “We note that, in the interest of conflict prevention and

peaceful settlement of disputes, international law also provides a framework for States’ responses to wrongful acts that do not

amount to an armed attack - these may include malicious cyber activities. Among other lawful responses, a State that is the victim

of an internationally wrongful act may, in certain circumstances, resort to proportionate countermeasures, including measures

conducted via ICTs, against the State responsible for the wrongful act in order to cause the responsible State to comply with its

international obligations”

58 Intelligence defense activity against hostile intelligence activity by foreign countries using information and communication

technology


-----

###### (ii) Threat Information Sharing

Information sharing among relevant ministries

and agencies within the government and with our

ally and like-minded countries is essential for

accurately responding to and deterring diverse

threat of cyberattacks, including those suspected

of state-sponsored and by non-governmental

organizations. Accordingly, the government will

promote the sharing of threat information with

our ally and like-minded countries. The

government will also strengthen the threat

information sharing and collaboration framework

within the government led by the Cabinet

Secretariat.

###### 4.3.3 [International Cooperation and] Collaboration

Because the effect of incidents in cyberspace can

easily extend beyond national borders, cyber

incidents in overseas can always affect Japan.

Japan will cooperate and collaborate with the

governments and private sector worldwide to

ensure the security of cyberspace and work

towards both the peace and stability of the

international community and the national

security of Japan.

To this end, the government will proactively

contribute to various international discussions

and work for the sharing of information and

development of common understanding

regarding cyber related issues. The government

will also share expertise with foreign countries,

promote specific cooperation and collaboration,

and take actual action. Furthermore, we will

secure and train personnel in the public and

private sectors who are capable of expressing our

position to the international fora.



###### [1] Sharing Expertise and Coordination Policy

The government will work through bilateral

dialogues and international conferences on

cybersecurity to exchange information on

cybersecurity policies, strategies and system to

respond, and utilize that knowledge in planning

Japan’s cybersecurity policy. We will also

strengthen its cooperation and collaboration

regarding cybersecurity policy with strategic

partners that share basic principles on

cybersecurity with us.

###### [2] International Collaboration for Incident Response

The government will share information on

cyberattacks and threats and strengthen

cooperation between CERTs59 to enable the

coordinated response when incidents occur. The

government will also work to improve

coordinated response capabilities through joint

training and participation in international cyber

drills and joint training. Furthermore, the

government will respond appropriately in the

case of incidents through appropriate

international collaboration.

###### [3] Cooperating for Capacity Building

Today, as interdependence across borders has

deepened, it is not possible for Japan to its secure

peace and stability only by itself. Global

coordination to reduce cybersecurity

vulnerabilities and to aim for their elimination

thereof is essential in contributing to ensuring

Japan’s national security.

From this standpoint, assisting capacity building

in other state ensures the stability of the lives of

Japanese residents and the activities of Japanese

companies in other countries that depend on

critical infrastructure in those states as well as the

sound development of the use of cyberspace

there. At the same time, it is also directly

connected to ensuring the security of all

cyberspace and contributes to the improvement

of the security environment for the entire world

including Japan.

According to the Basic Strategy on Cybersecurity

Capacity Building for Developing Countries60

published in 2016, the government will

proactively promote capacity building in

developing countries.

|4.4|Cross-Cutting Approaches to Cybersecurity|
|---|---|


In order to achieve the three policy goals –

“enabling socio-economic vitality and sustainable

development,” “building a safe and secure society

for the people,” and “contribution to the peace

and stability of the international community and

Japan’s national security,”- it is important to work

on human resource development and research

and development as a foundation for the policy

goals from both a cross-cutting and mid- and

long-term perspective. Simultaneously, it is also

crucial to promote a cooperative approach in

which everyone plays a role in working on

cybersecurity as an active agent in cyberspace.

###### Development and Assurance 4.4.1 of Cybersecurity Human Resource

value is being created towards the realization of

Society 5.0, and it is necessary that each

stakeholder take the initiative and play their

respective roles rather than relying on the efforts

of few experts to ensure cybersecurity.

In preparation for the future relevant to this

coming paradigm shift, there is a need to clarify

the level of knowledge and skill required of

personnel involved in establishing cybersecurity

from the standpoint of supporting each

organization to carry out its mission and the safe

use of cyberspace. Following this, it is necessary

to form a virtuous circle in which the supply and

demand for personnel is appropriated by:

adequately treating personnel with good

knowledge and practical abilities, certified by

qualifications and evaluation standards obtained

through education and; further enabling them to

hone their skills through repeated practical

experience.

To that end, the government will work with

industry, academia, and the public sector to share


information on the demand for personnel and

measures regarding human resource

development in order to strengthen the

development and assurance of the cybersecurity

human resource. In doing so, it is important to

ensure the diversity of personnel from the

standpoint of promoting innovation.

###### [1] Training and Adoption at the Strategic Management Level

In order to push forward cybersecurity measures

as a part of company management, it is

inappropriate to leave the task up to experts and

operational level staff because cybersecurity is

not simply a technical issue.

Under the management strategies and business

strategies that the senior executive management

presents, the personnel capable of meeting this

challenge must:

(i) understand the cybersecurity-related risks

that must be assumed in conducting

operations and services as part of the risks

that an organization must manage; and

(ii) utilize and command operational- level staff

experts to execute countermeasures and

responses to incidents in the role of providing

the core support for risk management

regarding business continuity and value

creation

Accordingly, the government will define the

personnel taking on these roles as the “strategic

management level” and work for the adoption of

this concept through collaboration with industry,

including the promotion of understanding among

the senior executives.

There are also cases where, due to differences in

culture or custom within industries or business

categories, it may be difficult to integrate and

implement cybersecurity measures into existing

management systems for realizing operations and

services. For that reason, the government will,

while taking into account consider that there are

many ways of business and management, and the

|4.4.1|Development and Assurance of Cybersecurity Human Resource|
|---|---|


-----

government will promote the implementation of

relearning programs, by means of the

development of practical learning materials for

the strategic management level and the

identification and training of instructors.

###### [2] Training for the Operational and Expert Level

As for the operational and expert level who

implement the measures regarding system

planning, building, and operation, based on the

instruction expressed by the strategic

management level, numerous educational

programs, certification and testing programs, and

training have been carried out through public and

private sector cooperation.

It is necessary to continue to strengthen such

initiatives to raise knowledge- and skill-levels.

Operational and expert level staff should also

deepen their understanding of the information

and communication technologies, control system

technologies and cyberattacks that evolve on a

daily basis. In addition, it is important in

responding to these attacks that they understand

the policies of senior executive management and

function as part of a team, communicating with

other expert level personnel. To do so, it is

necessary to use development programs for

operational and expert levels to develop skills for

understanding the conceptual and abstract ideas

presented by the strategic management level and

converting them into concrete measures while

engaging in smooth communication with a

variety of stakeholders.

The government will also continue to identify,

train, and assure personnel with exceptional

abilities who are capable of competing on the

global stage. For example, the government will

continue to promote the expansion of

opportunities for personnel to apply themselves

diligently to acquire world-class competitive

ability and the development of their capability to

examine measures through research on such


subjects as response methods, including attack

methods and defense methods against

cyberattacks, and the systematization of methods

for collecting, analyzing, and evaluating

information.

###### [3] Preparing a Foundation for Development of Cybersecurity Human Resource

In preparation for the evolution of information

and communication technologies in the mid- and

long-term, it is necessary to promote the

understanding of the basic principles that form

the foundation for cybersecurity as an applied

sector and improve the initiatives for developing

the ability to think logically and conceptually. To

that end, regarding the fundamentals of

cybersecurity and information and

communication technologies, the industry,

academia, and the public sector will collaborate

to consider the knowledge and technology

systems and a model curriculum based on those

systems.

The government will also steadily work on

fostering the ability to utilize information within

the educational curriculum at the elementary and

secondary educational level in order to

strengthen the education among youth

concerning cybersecurity and information and

communication technology skills, including such

measures as making computer science a required

subject from elementary school, and cultivating

logical modes of thinking, such as

programmatical thinking, and an understanding

of the systems and principles of information and

communication technologies according to the

levels of children’s development. The government

will place an emphasis on expanding and

enrichment of training for teachers, while also

working to ensure that course items regarding the

fostering of the ability to utilize information are

properly included in the teacher training courses.


-----

When doing so, it is important to promote the

flexible utilization of personnel from industry as

necessary. In addition, promoting information

moral education is another important issue, due

to the rise in cybercrime perpetrated by the youth

in recent years.

Furthermore, it is also necessary to prepare an

environment in which there are abundant

opportunities for the youth, who are expected to

acquire advanced cybersecurity skills in the

future, to take an interest and learn freely using

cybersecurity tools and devices in places outside

the school curriculum such as the community,

companies, and organizations through the

flexible use of industry personnel. At the same, it

is considered that the development of this

environment for self realization will be effective

in preventing cybercrime perpetrated by youth

out of curiosity when combined with ethics

education. The government will also continue to

promote the development of human resources for

information technology in higher education such

as universities and National institute of

technology through industry-academia-public

partnerships.

###### [4] Strengthening the Assurance and
 Development of Cybersecurity
 Human Resource at Agencies

The government will continue to work to steadily

ensure and develop cybersecurity human resource

at the Agencies under the command and control

function of the full-time Assistant Vice Minister

for Cybersecurity and Information Technology

Management who carries out security measures

based on the unified policy for governmental

bodies. The government will also steadily carry

out initiatives based on the human resource

assurance and development plans of Agencies,

through the increase of staff, training appropriate

to each level for increasing knowledge and ability,

and practice involving high level security

technicians, and ensuring appropriate


compensation, while working to further improve

those initiatives through annual reviews of plans.

###### [5] Promoting International Partnership

Considering that the response to cybersecurity

issues are needed on a global scale, Japan should

enable the possibility for global application as

much as possible as a part of the development of

cybersecurity human resource, instead of

fulfilling that need within Japan alone. To this

end, the government will collaborate with leading

nations to build a system for promoting

collaboration in various ways with organizations

engaged in human resource development

overseas, such as the implementation of joint

training programs and certification of credit

transfer, by certifying the human resource

development programs of universities and public

institutions as meeting certain requirements

according to international standards.

In addition, with the aim to contribute to the

development of cybersecurity human resource

overseas as well, the government will utilize the

knowledge and experience gained through the

development of cybersecurity human resource in

Japan to contribute to the capacity building

among cybersecurity human resource overseas.

###### 4.4.2 [Advancement of Research and] Development

As the unification of cyberspace and real space

continues, practical research and development

(R&D) on cybersecurity is needed, given the

advancement of innovation in cyberspace and the

threat of cyberattacks against those innovations.

Along with this, responses with a view to

discontinuous evolution of technology and society

over the mid- and long-term are also necessary.

###### [1] Promoting Practical R&D

Innovative new products and services are

expected to be created through the combination

|4.4.2|Advancement of Research and Development|
|---|---|


-----

of various information and communication

technologies such as IoT and AI. The provision of

products and services with a high level of security

quality is essential when aiming for the growth of

industry and the enhanced international

competitiveness for Japan.

Meanwhile the use of these technologies has the

potential to generate new vulnerabilities that did

not previously exist. To that end, the government

will work with a focus on technology that ensures

cybersecurity through the use of such advanced

technologies as AI and blockchain, security

technology that can be built in to the systems

comprising products and services, and practical

R&D regarding the methods for such built-in

security technology. In particular, the

government will promote R&D on certification

and generating trust, and ensuring traceability in

the value creation processes of supply chains, and

on detection of and defense against attacks in

these areas. In addition, it will also engage in the

development of technology to effectively detect

malicious hardware and software built into

devices and in R&D to ensure the authenticity,

availability, and confidentiality of data and

information when behavior unintended by the

user may be caused on the platform.

The government will also promote R&D that

increases situational awareness capabilities in

cyberspace including the ability to detect and

analyze cyberattacks, and contributes to ensuring

national security in cyberspace, such as the

improvement of defensive and response

capabilities and ensuring of resilience.

Specifically, the government will promote R&D

with the aims to understanding attack activity by

luring attackers into networks that imitate

organization such as governmental bodies and

companies, and to reduce the burden of wide area

network scanning for the survey on vulnerable

IoT devices on the network. In implementing this

R&D, it is important to form a virtuous cycle in

which the knowledge and experience of


cyberattacks from the cybersecurity operations

workplace is shared with researchers as quickly as

possible for application in R&D, while the results

of the R&D is also shared for application in the

cybersecurity operations workplace as quickly as

possible. To achieve this, the government will

promote the sharing of information in real time

between security operations companies and

governmental research and development

institutions.

It is also important to ensure means to verify, as

necessary, that malicious programs and circuits

are not built into the devices and software used in

the systems of governmental bodies and critical

infrastructure operators. Accordingly, the

government will take a central role to develop a

system for carrying out the necessary technical

inspections while also working on R&D necessary

for that purpose. R&D will also be promoted on

fundamental technologies that are essential to

the state from the standpoint of national security,

such as encryption technology that takes into

account the development of computing

technologies (e.g. quantum computing and AI).

Furthermore, in addition to these technology

related R&D, research and studies on policy issues

in cybersecurity measures will also be promoted,

such as clarifying the interpretation of

cybersecurity related laws and regulations.

Regarding these R&D initiatives for cybersecurity,

the government will promote the dissemination

and social adoption of the results. In addition, it

will work to strengthen R&D-related international

partnerships in the public and private sectors with

like-minded countries that share basic values with

Japan through joint research and the creation of

international standards based on the research

results while proactively participating in overseas

events to disseminate information

internationally.


-----

###### [2] Responses with a View to the Mid- and Long-Term Evolution of Technology and Society

As the unification of cyberspace and real space

proceeds, advancements in information and

communication technologies such as AI and VR

are making it possible to share diverse

experiences including the processes by which

they are formed, while acknowledging the

different values of each individual. Amid the

major changes to humanity brought about by

these technologies, there is a possibility that the

current received logic of social systems will

fundamentally change in the future, and there

will be a limit to what can be done with the

existing approach of cybersecurity R&D that

extrapolates from the evolution of technology so

far. In order to generate new value, it is likely that

a new approach will become necessary that

designs overall society from the standpoint of the

ecosystem, which humans are part of, looking

ahead the future from the present where the

continued unification of cyberspace and real

space is taking place. To that end, with a view to

mid- and long-term, the government will promote

research on coordination and unification between

cybersecurity various academic disciplines,

including social scientific perspectives from the

disciplines such as law and international

relations, national security, and business

administration, and also the humanistic and

sociological perspectives from the disciplines

including philosophy and psychology. It goes

without saying that the results of R&D, including

R&D in the fields of science and technology, must

not impact human society in a negative way.

|4.4.3|Cooperation by Everyone who is the Main Player in Cybersecurity|
|---|---|


With the spread of devices such as smartphones

and public wireless networks, every people are

connected to cyberspace and enjoys the

significant benefits thereof. This trend is expected

to accelerate with the advancement of IoT.

Meanwhile, for the safe and secure use of

cyberspace on a continuous basis amid the

spreading threat of cyberattacks, it is essential for

each and every people as an active agent in

cyberspace to cultivate their awareness and

understanding of cybersecurity so that they can

deal with various risks in cyberspace in the same

manner as the measures for crime prevention and

traffic safety in real space, so that they can use

cyberspace safely and securely.

For cultivating this awareness and understanding

of cybersecurity, there is a limit to the

effectiveness of existing campaign initiatives

carried out by the state alone. Rather, the

government is required to build a system that

enables stakeholders to collaborate and cooperate

according to their mutual division of

responsibilities while respecting the autonomous

activities of various communities such as regions,

companies, and schools, and to exercise its

leadership through the approach to support such

system.

Accordingly, with the National center of Incident

readiness and Strategy for Cybersecurity playing

the key role, the government will enable

stakeholders in industry, academia, and the

public and private sectors to operate smoothly

and effectively and collaborate organically.

Specifically, it will develop a comprehensive

strategy and specific action plan for public

awareness on cybersecurity and disseminate

necessary information and handle inquiries by

the people. The government will also promote

practical action by the stakeholders by utilizing


-----

committees in which representatives of various

communities in industry, academia, and the

public and private sectors participate. The

government will also work to further enhance

Cybersecurity Awareness Month as a period to

concentrate on promoting the understanding of

cybersecurity by each and every people. It will

also promote cybersecurity education through

the creation and distribution of easy-to
understand guidebooks for people and through

the development of the ability to utilize

information through school curriculums.

Manufacturers and sellers of devices such as

smartphones and personal computers and

telecommunications companies such as

communications carriers and Internet providers

are expected to enable users to carry out

cybersecurity initiatives appropriately by

providing security-friendly products and services

and by explaining to users and responding to

their inquiries. For this reason, the government

will develop an environment that promotes

initiatives by these businesses and related

organizations and promote the development and

steady implementation of guidelines useful to the

establishment of cybersecurity based on user

needs and usage forms.

The Government has been promoting a policy of

improving cybersecurity measures to secure the

use and application of information and

communication technologies and data61 as the

socio-economic foundation of society62 and to

ensure Japan’s national security.63

Under this policy, relevant governmental bodies

should play their active roles in promoting

cybersecurity measures, while making them

consistent as a whole. For this purpose, the

related government bodies will keep working on

improving their cybersecurity capabilities under

the leadership of the National center of Incident

readiness and Strategy for Cybersecurity to ensure

steady implementation of the measures

stipulated in this strategy. The National center of

Incident readiness and Strategy for Cybersecurity

will play its leading role as the focal point in

coordinating intra-government collaboration and

promoting partnerships between industry,

academia, and the public and private sectors

while disseminating this strategy to relevant

parties in Japan and abroad. The Government will

further reinforce its crisis management and

response capabilities. In connection with the

upcoming Tokyo 2020 Games, particular

consideration should be given to steady


implementation of cybersecurity measures by

building up schemes of involvement, partnership,

and collaboration of the industrial, academic,

government, and community sectors.

The Cybersecurity Strategic Headquarters will

closely work with the Strategic Headquarters for

the promotion of an Advanced Information and

Telecommunications Network Society when it

works on critica l cybersecurity issues. The

headquarters will collaborate and share

information with the crisis management organs,

including a headquarters for emergency response

to terrorism, when established, and take

appropriate actions concerning national security,

in close coordination with the National Security

Council.

Furthermore, the headquarters will respond to

issues concerning national security in close

coordination with the NSC. In such cases, the

relevant governmental bodies will work together

under the overall coordination by the National

Security Secretariat.

The Cybersecurity Strategic Headquarters will

establish a budget prioritization policy and seek

to secure and execute the budget necessary for

the government so that the measures of the

respective Agencies are steadily and effectively


61 The Declaration to be the World’s Most Advanced IT Nation: Basic Plan for the Advancement of Public and Private Sector Data

Utilization (May 30, 2017) specifies that “In promoting the use and application of data, it goes without saying that measures should

be concurrently carried out in connection with the protection of personal information and privacy, cyber-security measures,

intellectual property rights, data quality and efforts to ensure the reliability and security of data, the state of logic in the era of AI

and robots, and more”.

62 Growth Strategy 2017 (Cabinet decision on June 9, 2017) states that “In the super smart society where people can live comfortably

and abundantly in all situations, securing a safe cyber space is an important foundation for economic and social activities in Society

5.0.”

63 The National Security Strategy (Cabinet decision on December 17, 2013) states that “cyberspace is necessary for promoting both

economic growth and innovation through the free flow of information in cyberspace. Protecting cyberspace from the above
mentioned risks is vital to secure national security.”

executed in accordance with the principles

stipulated in this strategy. The headquarters will

also encourage the collaboration between the

public and private sectors to pursue effective

intelligence and analysis capabilities, as well as

mechanisms for flawless cycle of early detection,

analysis, judgment and handling of cyberattacks.

Going forward, in order to implement this

strategy in an accurate manner, the Cybersecurity

Strategic Headquarters will set forth annual plans

including the attached list of Agencies in charge

during the three-year implementation period of

this strategy, and the Agencies will steadily

implement the measures on its basis. The

headquarters will also review the status of

progress of these measures, compile this as an

annual report, and reflect it in the annual plan for

the following year. Furthermore, since the

situations and technical premises regarding

cyberspace may evolve in a discontinuous

manner, the strategy itself may be flexibly

reviewed when necessary irregardless of the

scheduled duration of the plan.
