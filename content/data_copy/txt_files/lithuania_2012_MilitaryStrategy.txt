**I. GENERAL PROVISIONS**

1. The Lithuanian Armed Forces (hereinafter – the “LAF”) are an integral part of the state and

society, contributing to the implementation of general national interests and objectives by carrying out
the tasks assigned to them. Following provisions of the Constitution of the Republic of Lithuania, laws
and the National Security Strategy of the Republic of Lithuania, the LAF protect and defend the
national sovereignty and territorial integrity of the state as well as contribute to ensuring international
security and stability. In case of war, Lithuania is defended by the war-time Armed Forces, with the
LAF being the main part of them.

2. The Lithuanian Armed Forces have a double responsibility. First of all, they are responsible

for the defence of Lithuania. However, as a member of NATO and the European Union (hereinafter –
the “EU”), Lithuania is also responsible for security and stability of the Euro-Atlantic region and has to
be capable of responding to international security challenges together with its Allies.

3. The aim of the Military Strategy of the Republic of Lithuania (hereinafter – the “Military

Strategy”) is to establish the ways of using the LAF to implement national security and defence policy
objectives and respond to the threats to national security.

4. The Military Strategy establishes the military objectives of Lithuania, the ways of

implementing these objectives and requirements for the LAF and the war-time Armed Forces.
Provisions of the Military Strategy serve as a foundation for the development of the National Defence
System (hereinafter – the NDS) and implementation of national security objectives in the context of
armed defence.

5. The present Military Strategy replaces the Lithuanian Military Strategy approved in 2004

and is built on the provisions of the Law of the Republic of Lithuania on the Basics of National
Security, the Law on Armed Defence and Resistance to Aggression and other laws, the National
Security Strategy, the NATO Strategic Concept, the EU Treaty of Lisbon, and the EU Security
Strategy.

**II. SECURITY ENVIRONMENT**

6. Although contradictory tendencies prevail in the international security environment, the

Lithuanian security environment remains rather favourable and predictable. Lithuanian security is
guaranteed by its membership in NATO whereas the membership in the EU gives additional security
guarantees; Lithuanian security is also enhanced through participation in activities of the United
Nations (hereinafter – the “UN”), the Organisation for Security and Cooperation in Europe (hereinafter
– the “OSCE”) and other international organisations, as well as through effective bilateral and
multilateral defence cooperation with its Allies and partners:

6.1. NATO has successfully adapted to changes in the international security environment and is

capable of responding both to traditional conventional threats and emerging security challenges. The
NATO Strategic Concept has proved that collective defence remains the key function of the Alliance,
while strong trans-Atlantic relations fostered by NATO members ensure viability of the Alliance.
Understating the importance of collective defence, NATO puts special emphasis on the maintenance
and/or development of collective defence capabilities, such as mobile and deployable conventional
forces, nuclear deterrence capabilities and missile defence system. The Alliance continues
strengthening capabilities of combating the threat of international terrorism, improves the ability to
detect cyber attacks and defend against them and contributes to ensuring energy security. Continuation


-----

of the NATO “open-door policy”, developing cooperation with other international organisations (e.g.
the UN, the EU) and partners and strengthening Euro-Atlantic and international security by conducting
diverse international operations remains among the key activities of the Alliance.

6.2. By signing the Treaty of Lisbon, EU Member States have established clauses of mutual

assistance and solidarity in the EU common security and defence policy (hereinafter – the “EU
CSDP”). These principles express solidarity of EU Member States in case of an armed aggression
against any EU Member State and mutual assistance during emergencies. These provisions of the
Treaty of Lisbon contribute to the strengthening of Lithuanian security. Currently most of the EU
CSDP activities are focused on the creation of a safer EU environment. To this end, EU civil and
military capabilities are developed and shall be used in conflict prevention, crisis management and
other international operations within the EU neighbourhood.

6.3. Through its active participation in activities of the UN, OSCE and other international

organisations Lithuania contributes to the strengthening of global and regional security as well as to the
creation of a favourable security environment for itself. The UN is the only global security-focused
international organisation, working to restore or preserve international peace, prevent the distribution of
weapons of mass destruction, fight against terrorism, reduce poverty (which is a reason of many
conflicts), and address other relevant security challenges. The OSCE, being the largest regional
organisation in the world, plays a significant role in strengthening democratic institutions and
defending human rights in OSCE participating states, resolving frozen conflicts, combating terrorism
and dealing with new energy and cyber security challenges as well as enhancing confidence-and
security-building measures among the participating states.

6.4. Close bilateral and multilateral defence cooperation with Baltic and Nordic countries, the

United States of America (the USA), Poland and other Allies allows a better coordination of actions in
various international security organisations, helps strengthen interoperability in military operations, and
contributes to the development of collective capabilities. Security-related cooperation with Eastern
European, South Caucasian and Central Asian countries that are not members of NATO or the EU
expands secure environment and contributes to the promotion of democratic values and regional
cooperation.

7. There are worrying trends in the Lithuanian security environment as well: growing

authoritarianism in the neighbouring Eastern nations, increasing military power of some neighbouring
Eastern states, demonstration of this power and even using it against other states. Despite these
worrying trends, neighbouring Eastern countries do not refuse to build mutual trust with NATO which,
in turn, gives an opportunity to ease the tension in the Baltic Sea and Eastern European regions.
Lithuania seeks to strengthen bilateral and multilateral security and trust-building measures together
with these countries as it would also help to increase the security of the Baltic Sea region and Eastern
Europe.

8. _Challenges, dangers and threats. Although the number of conventional military conflicts has_

decreased since the Cold War, the role of armed forces has expanded considerably as a result of new,
emerging security challenges. Contradictory, hardly predictable, non-traditional threats raise new tasks
for the armed forces. On the other hand, as the balance of power in international relations is changing,
the likelihood of traditional military confrontation remains as well. Therefore, the LAF shall be ready
to respond to the following challenges, dangers and threats:

8.1. _conventional military threats. At present Lithuania does not face any direct military threat._

However, non-democratic states with an alarmingly increasing military power and stronger tendencies
to demonstrate it remains in the close security environment of Lithuania. Therefore, military threats of
a conventional character are likely to persist in the future;


-----

8.2. _local and regional crises. Failed or failing states are still the most conflict-prone, as_

governments there are often incapable of ensuring effective territorial control and security of their
citizens as well as dealing with economic and social problems. Conflicts in these states are difficult to
localise and have a negative impact on both regional and global security as they cause humanitarian
crises, foster organised crime, terrorism and piracy, hamper the supply of strategically important
resources;

8.3. _information attacks. Some states and non-state actors are disseminating ungrounded or_

misleading information with an aim to shape public opinion on national security and defence policy.
Such information attacks generate distrust and disaffection with the democratic order and the NDS,
discredit the Alliance, its capabilities and actions as well as weaken the public spirit, patriotism and
determination to defend the country. The development and wide availability of information
technologies and systems are likely to cause even more information attacks in the future;

8.4. _cyber attacks. Due to a rapid progress in modern information and communications_

technologies cyber space has become a new space for conflicts. Specific functioning of the cyber space
makes it difficult to identify subjects who use it to organise cyber attacks against information and
communications systems of public authorities, strategic economic objects, private companies and nongovernmental organisations. Some states and non-state actors are trying to use cyber attacks to achieve
their goals, such as disturbing the functioning of highly important information and communications
systems and facilities, getting classified information or economic benefits, etc. With the increasing
dependence of civil and military sectors on modern information and communications technology, some
countries and non-state actors will seek to exploit cyber attacks more frequently, which poses a great
threat to national security;

8.5. _energy security challenges. Growing energy needs makes ensuring energy security during_

military operations a highly relevant issue. Interrupted energy supply, disruption of critical energy
infrastructure, dependence on a certain type of fuel and on one or several energy suppliers may have a
negative impact on successful implementation of military tasks as well as lead to new armed conflicts.
Due to limited energy resources and intensifying competition among states, the importance of energy
security challenges will not decline;

8.6. _activities of foreign intelligence services. The threat posed by activities of foreign_

intelligence services directed against international organisations, the member of which Lithuania is, and
against Lithuania itself is increasing. The aim of these activities is to obtain classified information and
negatively affect Lithuanian military capabilities, the political system and socio-economic life. Due to
the presumed link with cyber and information security challenges, this threat is likely to grow in the
future;

8.7. _terrorism._ Although there are no favourable conditions for a terrorist network to form in the

territory of Lithuania, Lithuania may be used as a transit country; its citizens as well as soldiers
participating in international operations may suffer from attacks in other countries. Critical national
energy, transport or cyber infrastructure may become a potential target of terrorist attacks. As terrorism
keeps raising a serious threat to the international community, NATO and the EU, the danger of terrorist
attacks against Lithuania will remain relevant in the future;

8.8. _climate change, natural disasters and industrial accidents._ Climate change and its effects,

natural and ecological disasters or industrial accidents may destabilise the State as well as regional
security. Although these threats are not of a military character, they can affect many people and have
long-term negative socio-economic consequences. The likelihood of such threats and the extent of their
outcomes are difficult to predict, but Lithuania shall be ready to respond to them by civil and military
means.


-----

**III. DEFENCE POLICY PRINCIPLES**

9. Military objectives of Lithuania and ways of implementing them are based on the following

basic principles of the national defence policy:

9.1. **_defence of Lithuania is total and unconditional. The total character of defence means that_**

Lithuania is defended by the national armed forces as well as those of NATO Allies, that all national
resources are invoked for national defence, and that every citizen of Lithuania and the entire nation
shall resist in every way defined as legitimate by international law. Defence of Lithuania is not subject
to any conditions and no one is allowed to inhibit the right of the nation and every citizen to resist an
aggressor, invader or anyone else threatening by force the independence, territorial integrity and
constitutional order of Lithuania.

9.2. **_Lithuanian security is based on individual and collective defence. Membership in NATO_**

gives Lithuania a responsibility to prepare the LAF and develop capabilities for individual and
collective defence of Lithuania or any other NATO member together with the Allies. At the same time,
membership in NATO guarantees that in case of an attack, Lithuania will be defended by the armed
forces of other NATO nations.

9.3. **_Lithuanian defence policy is non-confrontational and transparent. Lithuania develops and_**

implements its national security policy (of which defence policy is an integral part) in a clear and open
way. Lithuania strengthens its national security by contributing to the efforts of the international
community to create a common security environment.

9.4. **_democratic command and control of the armed forces_** is one of the main organising

principles of the NDS, meaning that all decisions on Lithuanian defence policy, the armed forces
development and employment, their provision and procurement of armament as well as on material
resources of the NDS and appropriations assigned for its armament and other needs are made by a
democratically elected civilian government.

**IV. MILITARY OBJECTIVES**

10. In order to implement the goal of the national security policy established by the Law of the

Republic of Lithuania on the Basics of National Security as well as to protect the vital and primary
interests of national security as defined in the National Security Strategy, and in line with the defence
policy principles, the following military objectives are set:

10.1. ensure reliable deterrence together with the Allies;

10.2. if deterrence fails, ensure the defence of Lithuania individually and together with the Allies

and properly contribute to collective defence actions outside the territory of Lithuania in case of
aggression against any other NATO member;

10.3. contribute to ensuring regional and international security and stability;

10.4. contribute to ensuring security in the State in peacetime.


-----

**V. IMPLEMENTATION OF MILITARY OBJECTIVES**

11. The LAF shall be ready to prevent potential threats, and if prevention fails – to respond in a

proper manner. To ensure implementation of the military objectives, the LAF shall be trained and
employed in the ways provided in the Military Strategy.

12. **_Ensuring deterrence. The aim of deterrence is to convince a potential aggressor that its_**

military actions against Lithuania will be doomed to failure and result in massive loss, which will make
it regret the act of aggression. Reliable deterrence is built on the aggressor’s understanding that
Lithuania is ready and able to defend itself successfully with the help of the LAF, Lithuanian citizens
and NATO allies. Ensuring reliable deterrence requires:

12.1. creating a well-trained and well-armed forces that are capable of executing defence tasks

of the country and the Alliance individually and/or together with Allies, forming reserve units to
reinforce regular forces in case of war, and developing a modern mobilisation system compliant to all
requirements;

12.2. developing a Host Nation Support (hereinafter – HNS) system to enable fast and smooth

deployment and movement of Allied forces in the territory of Lithuania;

12.3. preparing citizens for total armed defence and unarmed civil resistance. Fostering the will

and ability of citizens to engage in a total resistance to an aggressor by enabling them to acquire and
improve their military skills and preparedness to defend the State (through active military and rifleman
service) and use different forms and ways of unarmed resistance. Citizens that are motivated and
prepared to defend the State will make the potential aggressor understand that in case of attack, it will
face the resistance of the whole nation;

12.4. making real contributions to the strengthening of collective defence capabilities of the

Alliance, participating in NATO projects and multilateral capability development initiatives, supporting
the Alliance’s deterrence policy and the principle of solidarity expressing the collective will of Allies to
defend from an armed attack, raising awareness on NATO in Lithuania and the region;

12.5. developing military intelligence capabilities that would allow the evaluation of respective

security threats in a timely and precise manner.

13. **_Individual and collective defence._** If deterrence fails, the LAF shall defend the national

sovereignty, Lithuanian territory, territorial waters and air space individually or together with Allies.
National defence is based on the balance between principles of territorial and collective defence, as
well as on the readiness to respond to aggression by conventional and non-conventional means:

13.1. when defending the Republic of Lithuania individually, the LAF will eliminate the

aggressor’s forces and neutralise its non-conventional (e.g. cyber) attacks by exploiting all available
means of defence;

13.2. when executing collective defence tasks of the Republic of Lithuania together with the

Allies, the LAF units will participate in joint military actions led by NATO operational command. A
well-developed HNS system shall ensure smooth deployment of NATO forces and provision of the
host nation support to reinforcing forces;

13.3. by supporting Allies in case of attack, the LAF will fulfil the collective defence

obligations of Lithuania as a NATO member.

14. **_Ensuring regional and international security. In order to contribute to regional and_**

international security, the LAF shall be used:


-----

14.1. to support NATO operations of different types and intensity by executing both combat and

non-combat tasks; to support multinational coalitions addressing security challenges that may have a
negative impact on the security and stability of the Euro-Atlantic region; to support the EU, UN and
OSCE operations and missions focused on conflict prevention and stabilising the situation in conflict
regions;

14.2. to ensure the implementation of international agreements related to conventional arms

control and non-proliferation of certain weapons as well as the implementation of security and
confidence-building measures;

14.3. to promote bilateral and multilateral military cooperation with Baltic and Nordic countries,

the USA, Poland, the United Kingdom, Germany, France and other NATO allies with an aim to
develop military capabilities together, increase the interoperability of the LAF and Allied forces and
increase visibility of NATO in Lithuania and the region;

14.4. to develop bilateral and multilateral military cooperation with countries in the Eastern

neighbourhood in order to encourage them to cooperate more closely with the Euro-Atlantic
community and contribute to the strengthening of international security.

15. **_Ensuring national security in peacetime. Due to the changing nature of threats the LAF as_**

well as institutions supporting them shall be ready to respond to military and non-military threats and
emergencies occurring in the country in peacetime. To ensure the well-being of society and assist state
or municipal institutions, the LAF and institutions supporting them shall develop capabilities to:

15.1. effectively perform military intelligence and counter-intelligence activities. Effective and

well-coordinated intelligence activities allow for the identification of a possible crisis at an early stage
and applying preventive measures against the spreading of the crisis. Close intelligence cooperation
with respective services of the Alliance creates conditions for a safe exchange of necessary information
and faster neutralisation of threats arising out of actions of foreign special services, organisations or
persons aimed at espionage, sabotage and destructive or terrorist activities;

15.2. in case of extreme situations and a state of emergency, provide assistance to state and local

municipal institutions if capabilities of these institutions are limited;

15.3. ensure security and defence of the national cyber space by contributing to the response to

mass cyber attacks carried out against Lithuanian public authorities and strategically important
economic entities with an aim to paralyse governance, stir panic in the society and severely affect the
economy.

**VI. REQUIREMENTS FOR THE LITHUANIAN ARMED FORCES**

16. Only modern and motivated armed forces, consisting of manoeuvrable, easy-to-deploy-and
sustain regular military units and reinforced by the prepared reserve, are able to ensure national defence
individually until reinforcement from the Allies has been provided, and successfully contribute to
collective defence and other military operations. In order to implement the established military
objectives, the LAF are subject to the following requirements:

16.1. Requirements for capabilities:

16.1.1. ability to act independently. The security of Lithuania as a NATO member is ensured by

NATO collective defence guarantees. However, in case of a military attack against Lithuania, the
Lithuanian Armed Forces shall be prepared for individual defence until reinforcement from the Allies
has been provided.


-----

16.1.2. _prepared reserve. In peacetime, Lithuania shall form a sufficient, properly trained and_

armed reserve, capable of fulfilling national defence needs, at the same time maintaining a limited
regular forces and active reserve.

16.1.3. ability to act together with NATO Allies. Effective participation of the LAF in collective

defence and other international operations may be ensured only by their interoperability with NATO
forces, therefore the LAF shall be prepared to operate together with Allies.

16.1.4. _readiness to work together with civil capabilities in international operations. Military_

and civilian capabilities are used together in today’s international operations, especially in those aimed
at stabilisation and reconstruction of conflict zones. The LAF shall be ready to implement objectives
within an international operation in coordination with different civil organisations and experts.

16.1.5. _readiness to participate in full-spectrum operations. The LAF shall be prepared for_

participation in high-intensity combat operations as well as international operations aimed at conflict
prevention, peacekeeping, stabilisation and reconstruction of a conflict-affected country/region and
provision of humanitarian aid.

16.1.6. _effective command and control. Mobile and up-to-date command, control and_

communications systems of the LAF shall ensure uninterrupted and reliable command of the LAF and
effective and well-coordinated interaction with forces of NATO and EU Member States. Military
command and control shall be improved through a wider use of network-enabled capabilities.

16.1.7. _ability to execute joint operations. Success of modern military operations depends_

substantially on the ability of military units assigned to different military forces to act together – that is
why different branches of the LAF shall be trained to execute joint operations together under the
control of single operational commander.

16.1.8. sustainability and survivability. Units of the LAF shall be able to maintain the required

military power (combat capacity) and independently ensure logistic support as long as necessary for
implementation of the operational tasks. The LAF must have the necessary protective equipment to
mitigate or eliminate the impact of hostile enemy actions as well as negative effects of natural
environment and weapons of mass destruction.

16.1.9. _deployability. The LAF shall be able to deploy its military units into the theatre of_

operation outside Lithuania by overland routes, strategic air and/or sea transport within a certain time
frame. The LAF shall also be capable of providing HNS to Allied forces.

16.1.10. _niche military capabilities. The LAF have to develop niche military capabilities that_

could be effectively used for implementing collective defence or other military operations with Allies
and partners.

16.1.11. military energy efficiency in operations. The LAF’ ability to perform the tasks assigned

to them (especially during military operations) is highly dependent on the availability and uninterrupted
supply of energy resources. Therefore, the ways of ensuring energy resources should be foreseen in
advance when planning military operations, whereas during the operations these resources shall be used
efficiently, but without reducing the combat power of the LAF.

**16.2.** **Requirements for military personnel:**

16.2.1. Leadership. Leadership is crucial in ensuring the motivation of soldiers to execute the

tasks assigned to them and maintaining their morality in difficult combat situations. Therefore, the LAF
shall educate professional leaders, capable of managing subordinates and striving for constant
improvement with an aim to execute military tasks in a timely, precise and creative manner.


-----

16.2.2. Motivation, initiative and combat spirit. Military personnel shall be trained and educated

to be proactive, motivated and capable of acting under extreme combat conditions. Lithuanian soldiers
shall also be characterised by a combat spirit and patriotism that would never let them lose their
motivation and unquestionable commitment to their nation and the State.

16.2.3. Ability to act in a multinational and multicultural environment. Readiness of Lithuanian

military personnel to implement collective defence and other military operations, as well as the success
of these operations, demands an ability to work in international military structures and act in a
multinational and multicultural environment. Therefore, the LAF’ personnel must be capable of using
official NATO languages and cooperating with representatives of different cultural backgrounds, know
the principles and procedures of interoperability of military forces and constantly improve their
qualifications in international courses.

**VII. REQUIREMENTS FOR THE WAR-TIME ARMED FORCES**

17. In case of aggression, defence of Lithuania will be ensured by the war-time armed forces

consisting of the LAF as well as other forces assigned to them by the laws of the Republic of Lithuania.
With regard to this, the war-time armed forces are subject to the following requirements:

17.1. combat training and interoperability. In order to ensure the readiness the war-time armed

forces, the mandatory requirements for interoperability and combat training shall be established by the
Chief of Defence of the Republic of Lithuania.

17.2. ability to respond to aggression immediately. In case of aggression, unit commanders of the

war-time armed forces (including the LAF) shall be ready to act immediately in accordance with the
advance plans of defence against aggression. The Chief of Defence ensures the development of these
plans in peacetime and performs the functions of the Commander of the war-time armed forces in the
state of war (aggression).

17.3. ability to act together with the Allies. In case of aggression, reliable national defence may be

ensured only by well-trained war-time armed forces capable of acting together with Allied forces.

**VIII. FINAL PROVISIONS**

18. Membership in NATO offers Lithuania protection against threats from which Lithuania could

neither defend itself alone nor resist for long on its own. However, it does not exempt Lithuania from
the responsibility to develop capabilities within the LAF to ensure both national defence and defence of
the Alliance. NATO’s capacity depends on the collective implementation of defence commitments by
its members and on the efforts of every Member State to strengthen its security and ability to defend
itself from an armed attack.

19. Strong, well-trained and armed, loyal to the Republic of Lithuania and its citizens, the LAF is

one of the keystones of Lithuanian security and independence. Lithuania is building forces that are
capable of implementing national defence tasks and those of the Alliance individually and in
cooperation with Allies as well as participating in crisis management operations and contributing to the
security initiatives of other international organisations.

20. The Military Strategy is a flexible and open document which is revised regularly in case of

fundamental changes in the security environment.
