## ` Overview`

1 In developing the 2016 Defence White Paper, Defence adopted an
integrated approach to bring together for the first time the key elements of
investment needed to deliver and sustain Australia’s defence capabilities.
The key elements include equipment, infrastructure, information and
communications technology, science and technology, and workforce.
Establishing a ten-year Integrated Investment Program will facilitate the
whole-of-capability and whole-of-life approach to investment reflected
in the implementation plan for the First Principles Review: Creating One
_Defence. It will also support strategy-led prioritisation of proposals and_
greater agility in investment decisions.

2 The Integrated Investment Program was developed through a
comprehensive Force Structure Review that assessed Australia’s
defence capability needs to meet the challenges of the future operating
environment into the 2030s. In designing the future force, the Force
Structure Review ensured alignment between defence strategy, capability,
and resources. The result is an affordable and balanced plan for a highly
capable, agile and potent Australian Defence Force (ADF) and Defence
capability more broadly, to meet our future requirements.

3 A key objective of the Force Structure Review was to ensure that key
enablers of capability such as wharves, airfields, training areas and
bases, information and communications technology systems, and
supporting science and technology were accorded appropriate priority
in investment decisions. Planned investment over the decade to
FY 2025–26 recognises the essential contribution of enablers to the
generation and sustainment of ADF capability.

4 The Integrated Investment Program will guide the implementation of
the bulk of investment over the decade to FY 2025–26 to build the
future force and Defence capability goals of the Defence White Paper.
The Integrated Investment Program will be reviewed annually as part


-----

OVERVIEW
## 8

of the development of the budget; the Program will evolve in response
to changes in Australia’s strategic circumstances, including capability
priorities, and developments in technology.

### Integrated Investment Program – Structure and Management

5 The force structure and our broader Defence capability comprises:

`` equipment such as ships, submarines, aircraft and armoured
vehicles

`` information and communications technology systems such as
static and deployable networks and communications systems

`` infrastructure such as airfields, port facilities and training areas

`` trained people, including ADF, APS and contracted personnel.

6 Defence has previously managed separate programs of investment
for major equipment, facilities and information and communications
technology and has endeavoured to maintain appropriate project
linkages both within and between each program, including:

`` the Unapproved Major Capital Investment Program (also known as
the Defence Capability Plan)

`` the Approved Major Capital Investment Program (those projects
that have received final Government approval for acquisition)

`` the Major Capital Facilities Program (including investment in
Defence bases, training ranges and infrastructure such as wharves
and airfields)

`` information and communications technology services

`` group and Service workforce plans.


-----

## 9


7 For the first time, these formerly separate programs are now
incorporated within the Integrated Investment Program. An integrated
approach to capital investment planning will provide the framework for
a more coherent and efficient approach to managing the development of
future Defence capability. A single investment program will reduce the
risk of incomplete or fragmented approaches to investment; for example,
if we acquire new ships or aircraft, then the supporting wharves and air
bases, the underlying information and communications technology, and
required changes to workforce priorities should be assessed by Defence
and considered by Government as an integrated whole.

8 As a management tool, the Integrated Investment Program will better
enable trade-offs and prioritisation of proposals from one year to
the next, as strategic circumstances evolve. Through this program,
managers will have greater visibility of the inter-relationship between
projects across different domains.

9 Importantly, the Integrated Investment Program will better enable
Defence to avoid making inadequate or ill-timed investment in those
enablers (such as infrastructure and information and communications
technology) that are fundamental to the generation of military capability.

10 The Integrated Investment Program focuses on the first ten years
of investment, with broad guidance on the second decade to
FY 2035–36 where feasible, to allow for longer-term investment
portfolio planning. It allocates investment of approximately $195 billion
(pre-ERC 2016–17 out-turned price basis) in the decade to FY 2025–26
to fund investment in support of the future force. Delivery of many
investments made in the decade to FY 2025–26 will extend well beyond
this decade; for instance future submarines and frigates.


-----

OVERVIEW
## 10

### Industry Involvement

11 As outlined in the Defence White Paper and the Defence Industry
Policy Statement, the Government recognises that an internationally
competitive Australian defence industry is a fundamental input to
Defence capability. Without the support of industry, Defence does not
have effective capabilities. This is especially the case in the increasingly
high-technology world of military systems.

12 The effective implementation of the Integrated Investment Program will
be underpinned by greater stability in Defence budgets, streamlined
capability development and acquisition processes, and closer and more
effective engagement between Defence and industry. The ambitious
and extensive program of future investment in major defence capability
that is set out in this document provides enormous opportunities for
industry; the program’s scope will also set challenges for industry in
responding in an effective and timely manner to these opportunities.

13 The Defence White Paper and Defence Industry Policy Statement set out
the Government’s policy for an internationally competitive Australian
defence industry that contributes more directly, and earlier in the
process, to support Defence’s capability development and sustainment
needs. Through the Integrated Investment Program, Australian
industry will have a broader view of potential opportunities in Defence
procurement, and greater certainty about the timing and sequencing of
planned approvals. This will inform business planning. The Integrated
Investment Program’s strong foundation in the strategy and policy
of the Defence White Paper will enable Defence and industry to work
more collaboratively in identifying and developing innovative capability
solutions that are driven by the outcomes sought.

14 The hard copy version of the Integrated Investment Program provides
a consolidated overview of the elements of the plan for the future
force; it does not provide an exhaustive list of projects. Since the


-----

## 11


status of projects will change as they move through the different
stages of the approval cycle, it will be inefficient to maintain a current
hard copy version of the Integrated Investment Program. To ensure
that industry has access to current information, an online version will
be periodically updated to reflect changes in the program. Defence
proposes to further develop the content and the level of detail provided
in the Integrated Investment Program. Early engagement with industry,
through dialogue mechanisms such as industry forums building on the
existing environmental working groups, will be a key part of the future
development of the Integrated Investment Program.

### The Future Force and Defence Capability

15 The planned future force builds on a solid foundation of existing ADF
capability. Our air capabilities are being transformed through agreed
plans, including the decision to acquire F-35A Lightning II Joint Strike
Fighter aircraft. The last decade to FY 2015–16 has seen substantial
investment in our land capabilities. The Integrated Investment Program
will invest further in new armoured vehicles, digitisation, and further
development of our amphibious capability. We are entering a major
program of modernisation for our naval capabilities, with key decisions
to be made on future submarines, frigates, and patrol vessels.

16 Importantly, the Integrated Investment Program addresses previous
underinvestment in the key enablers that support and maximise
Australia’s defence capability. The focus on enablers will ensure our
future force is appropriately supported, works coherently together as a
whole, and is sustainable.

17 The Force Structure Review undertaken in support of the Defence
White Paper has ensured that current Defence capabilities, and those
proposed, are aligned with strategic guidance, so that Defence can do
the jobs asked of it by the Australian Government, and are affordable

within agreed resources. The Strategic Defence Framework that guided
development of the Integrated Investment Program is outlined in Table 1.

of Pacific Island Countries to build and

18 The Force Structure Review’s investment planning was guided by all
three Strategic Defence Objectives listed above, which for the first
time carried equal weight in guiding decisions on force structure and
posture. Interoperability with the United States was also a key principle
of our force design. Defence’s strategic policy framework is outlined in
greater detail in the Defence White Paper. The future force and Defence
capability goals in this Integrated Investment Program will enhance
our ability to: defend Australia; conduct independent operations in our
region, in particular maritime South East Asia and the South Pacific; and
contribute to global coalition operations.

19 Building on existing capabilities, the ADF of the future will feature
decision-making superiority, and enabled, mobile and sustainable
forces with potent and agile offensive response capabilities. Key to the
effective development of the future force will be to ensure that Defence
has the skilled people we need, in the right timeframes. This will require
some reshaping of the Defence workforce, supported by innovative
ADF and Defence APS workforce recruitment, training and retention
programs, in line with the First Principles Review. Defence will also be
postured to deliver a more active and internationally engaged ADF that is
highly interoperable with United States forces.

20 The breadth, complexity and interrelated nature of all Defence capabilities
and enablers led to the development, in the Force Structure Review,
of a new framework to adequately explain the link between strategy and
capability. The six capability streams in the framework are used in
the Integrated Investment Program to better represent the key force
elements – how they are typically employed and their planned
enhancements. This was a deliberate move away from describing our
capability investment plans in a stovepiped structure. These six capability
streams also support building a clearer picture of the link between
capabilities, systems and their supporting enablers in creating key
Defence outputs:

`` Intelligence, surveillance, reconnaissance, electronic warfare,
space and cyber

`` Key enablers

`` Air and sea lift

`` Maritime and anti-submarine warfare

`` Strike and air combat

`` Land combat and amphibious warfare.

21 The relationship between the key attributes of the future force and planned
enhancements across the six capability streams is outlined in Table 2.

Table 2: Future force attributes mapped to capability streams

|Key Attributes|Defence Capability Streams|
|---|---|
|Decision-making superiority|Intelligence, surveillance, reconnaissance, electronic warfare, space and cyber|

22 This framework provides a clearer basis to describe the scope and
level of capital investment associated with each of the six capability
streams, and provides a more comprehensive picture of plans for the
development of the future force and Defence capability more broadly.
Each attribute and its associated capability streams are discussed in
more detail on the following pages, including the major equipment,
facilities, information and communications technology, and workforce
investments that relate to each category.

##### Decision-Making Superiority

23 To ensure our forces can operate effectively and safely in our region
and globally, they need a comprehensive picture of what is happening
around them. They also need to be able to operate effectively in a
contested electronic environment. This requires analysis, fusion and
dissemination of information to support decision makers at all levels.

**_Intelligence, surveillance, reconnaissance, electronic warfare, space_**
**_and cyber_**

24 Existing capabilities and approved acquisitions that contribute to
Australia’s intelligence, surveillance, reconnaissance, electronic warfare,
_space and cyber capabilities include:_

`` the air defence network (including the Vigilaire air surveillance
network and the Jindalee operational radar network)

`` our access to a range of situational awareness information
including from space surveillance systems (C-band radar and
space surveillance telescope) supported by Australia’s alliance
with the United States and membership of the Five-Eyes
intelligence community

`` electronic warfare operational support capabilities

`` a growing cyber capability.


-----

## 15


25 Defence will strengthen existing capabilities in the intelligence,
_surveillance, reconnaissance, electronic warfare, space and cyber function_
including in support of domestic counter-terrorism, through acquiring:

`` modernised all-source intelligence systems supported by
enhanced processing capabilities

`` enhanced space situational awareness

`` enhanced capacity to generate and analyse imagery

`` new and enhanced unmanned intelligence, surveillance, and
reconnaissance capabilities (including the MQ-4C Triton
unmanned aircraft system)

`` a new electronic warfare support capability based on long-range
commercial aircraft

`` new and enhanced command, control, communications and
intelligence, surveillance and reconnaissance systems.

26 Australia will develop its cyber capabilities to deter and defend against
the threat of cyber attack. Enhanced cyber capabilities will improve our
ability to defend our own networks and systems effectively and ensure
the ADF is able to operate securely as the global cyber threat increases.

##### Enabled, Mobile and Sustainable Forces

**_Key enablers_**

27 The proposed future force accords a high priority to increasing
investment in those key enablers essential to supporting the operation
and sustainment of the future force. Defence will implement a
comprehensive program of investment aimed at:

`` continuously developing, monitoring and maintaining critical
infrastructure including airfields, wharves and port facilities, key
ADF bases and logistics systems such as fuel and explosive
ordnance facilities


-----

OVERVIEW
## 16

`` upgrading weapons ranges, testing facilities and health services
(that enable training and exercises to support more advanced
weapons and systems development, and joint integration in
realistic conditions)

`` upgrading training facilities that enable ADF training and exercises
(including in collaboration with other partners)

`` developing enterprise simulation capabilities to support enhanced
joint ADF test and training activities

`` upgrading garrison and deployable health services

`` enhancing information and communications technology that
supports all Defence business from peacetime activities through to
high end combat operations

`` using science and technology programs to investigate next
generation technologies so that Defence can both leverage,
and where necessary protect against, potential new military
applications

`` strengthening force design, strategic and international policy
capabilities, and international engagement that supports and
sustains Defence operations and increased presence in the region.

**_Air and sea lift_**

28 Given the huge distances over which the ADF must operate – in our
own country, region and globally – robust air and sea lift capabilities
are essential. Flexible air and sea lift capabilities will enable the ADF to
reach, resupply and sustain missions in different locations and to move
around the area of operations in a timely and reliable manner.

29 The existing capabilities and approved acquisitions that contribute to air
and sea lift are:

`` transport aircraft (8 C-17A Globemaster IIIs, 12 C-130J Hercules,
and 10 C-27J Spartans)


-----

## 17


`` air-to-air refuelling aircraft (7 KC-30A Tankers)

`` helicopters (7 CH-47F Chinooks and 47 MRH-90 Troop lift
helicopters)

`` a logistics support ship (HMAS Choules)

`` acquisition of a new large-hulled multi-purpose patrol vessel, the
Australian Defence Vessel Ocean Protector, for the Navy to support
border protection and maritime resource security-related tasks with
the Australian Border Force.

30 The Canberra Class amphibious ships can also provide substantial
support for sea lift as a secondary role.

31 Enhancements in this capability stream to support the future force include:

`` additional air-to-air refuellers

`` acquiring three additional Chinooks to expand battlefield lift
capacity and support tactical missions (including aero-medical
evacuation)

`` 2 new replenishment vessels, with an additional vessel (a
replenishment ship or logistics support ship) to be acquired in the
late 2020s

`` extending the life of, and upgrading HMAS Choules

`` considering future additional heavy-lift transport aircraft

`` considering a future long-range aero-medical evacuation and
combat search and rescue capability.

##### Potent and Agile Offensive Response

**_Maritime and anti-submarine warfare_**

32 A force that is able to conduct more challenging maritime and
anti‑submarine warfare operations in the broader region will improve
Defence’s ability to meet future operational demands, including a


-----

OVERVIEW
## 18

greater contribution to theatre anti-submarine operations in our region.
This includes the ability to conduct a spectrum of tasks ranging from
border security and hydrographic survey, through to patrols, anti-piracy
operations and combat at sea. Our maritime force will become more
potent out to the 2030s through the acquisition of higher capability
systems and better integration of sea and air platforms.

33 Existing capabilities and approved acquisitions that contribute to
Australia’s maritime and anti-submarine warfare capabilities include:

`` the Collins Class submarine fleet, which will be upgraded to
ensure that it remains a potent capability through the rest of its life

`` P-8A Poseidon maritime surveillance and response aircraft

`` Seahawk naval combat helicopters

`` sensor, weapons and combat system upgrades to the Anzac Class
frigates and Hobart Class Air Warfare Destroyers

`` the current fleet of Armidale Class patrol boats, supplemented by
additional patrol boats as required.

34 New investments to build the capability and capacity of Australia’s
maritime force include:

`` 12 regionally superior submarines to replace Australia’s existing
fleet of 6 Collins Class submarines

`` 9 anti-submarine warfare frigates to replace Australia’s existing
fleet of 8 Anzac Class frigates

`` 12 patrol vessels capable of more extended operations than the
existing Armidale Class patrol boats

`` initially an additional 4 Poseidon aircraft, with a further 3 aircraft
later in the 2020s to bring the total to 15

`` modernised mine countermeasures and an efficient combination
of military and commercial hydrographic survey capabilities

`` a new deployable land-based anti-ship missile capability.


-----

## 19


**_Strike and air combat capability_**

35 A potent strike and air combat capability will enable effective airspace
control (in the defence of Australia and its territories or when ADF
elements are deployed on operations) and precision strike at long
ranges. A robust set of current and planned platforms and systems
provide the basis upon which to build the future capability, which could
encompass theatre-level integrated air and missile defence in support
of deployed forces. Substantial investments are proposed to strengthen
our platforms; command, control, communications, computer and
intelligence systems; sensors; and advanced weapons.

36 Existing capabilities and approved acquisitions that contribute to
Australia’s strike and air combat capability include:

`` fighter and strike aircraft (24 F/A-18F Super Hornets and 72 F-35A
Lightning II Joint Strike Fighters) and our current fleet of
71 F/A‑18A/B 'classic' Hornets which is being progressively retired

`` electronic attack aircraft (12 E/A-18G Growlers)

`` early warning and control aircraft (6 E-7A Wedgetails)

`` air defence systems.

37 These capabilities will be enhanced through:

`` new air-to-surface, air-to-air and high-speed and long-range strike
and anti-ship weapons

`` upgrades for the Growler aircraft

`` future replacement of the Super Hornets

`` better integration of air and space surveillance systems, including
upgrades to command and control capabilities

`` enhanced fixed and deployable air search radars

`` deployable ground-based air-defence systems

`` light helicopters that are rapidly deployable by transport aircraft.


-----

OVERVIEW
## 20

**_Land combat and amphibious warfare capability_**

38 While relatively small on a regional or global scale, substantial
investment in our land force capabilities, in particular in the last ten
years, has provided a solid foundation upon which to further develop the
ADF’s land combat and amphibious warfare capabilities.

39 Existing capabilities and approved acquisitions include:

`` advanced personal equipment for soldiers

`` protected mobility (such as Bushmasters and the Hawkei)

`` enhanced force protection (such as capabilities to
counter improvised explosive devices)

`` new artillery

`` enhanced digital communications.

40 In addition, the Canberra Class amphibious ships will provide options
for the employment of land forces across the region.

41 New investments will enhance land combat and amphibious warfare
capabilities through improved situational awareness, firepower, protection,
mobility and force sustainability. These investments will include:

`` a program for continuously improving soldiers’ personal
equipment and force protection

`` expanding digital communications and networks with enhanced
joint integration

`` acquiring a new generation of armoured vehicles

`` upgrading the existing M1 Abrams Main Battle Tank fleet

`` enhancing battlefield intelligence, surveillance and
reconnaissance capabilities through a new armed,
medium‑altitude long-endurance unmanned aircraft and a suite of
tactical unmanned systems


-----

## 21


`` replacing the Tiger helicopter fleet with a future armed aerial
reconnaissance capability from the mid-2020s

`` acquiring combat and amphibious support systems including
over-the-beach logistics and beached materiel recovery

`` acquiring additional small boats and other specialist capabilities
such as breaching, bridging and recovery equipment

`` acquiring a new long-range rocket system.

42 Further detail of the key elements of existing and planned future ADF
and Defence capabilities is provided throughout this document.

### Defence Workforce

43 The Defence workforce, both ADF and APS, will need to be reshaped
to meet the demands of a more technologically capable and active
future force.

44 The future force will require a larger ADF workforce. As outlined in the
Defence White Paper, the permanent ADF workforce will grow to around
62 400 over the decade to FY 2025–26 – its largest size since 1993.
This growth reflects around 4 800 new or reallocated ADF positions,
comprising a net increase over currently approved plans of around
2 500 positions over the decade to FY 2025–26. Up to 2 300 existing
positions will be re‑allocated to higher priority activities. As the future
force evolves over the longer term (in the 2030s), further growth is likely
to be required along with changes for the different skills needed. A new
contemporary workforce management model will increase the ability of
ADF members to move between the permanent ADF and Reserves to
best meet their individual circumstances and best harness their skills
and expertise. This will provide ADF members with more opportunities
to contribute to Australia’s defence.


-----

OVERVIEW
## 22

45 In addition to the growth in ADF numbers, the Defence White Paper will
provide for a future APS workforce of around 18 200 Full Time Equivalent
(FTE), down from 22 300 FTE in June 2012. This workforce will include
approximately 1 200 new APS positions in areas critical to Defence’s
future capability, including intelligence, cyber security and space-based
capabilities. The new positions will be offset by reductions elsewhere in
the APS workforce. Implementation plans for the First Principles Review
will inform the future shape of the Defence organisation and the Defence
APS workforce in particular.

46 The generation of sustainable workforce capacity in key skill areas will
require concerted effort well beyond the mid-2020s. There will continue
to be challenges in attracting, recruiting and retaining the right people
for the right jobs in an increasingly competitive market place. The
strength of Defence’s leadership and its ability to adapt and embrace
a more diverse and inclusive culture will be critical to attracting and
retaining the workforce it needs for the future. Defence will employ
a range of strategies to achieve the skilled workforce required in the
timeframe needed to deliver and support the future force.

47 It is essential that Defence pursues enterprise solutions to workforce
challenges, including a more strategic approach to workforce planning;
enhanced information and communications technology systems will be
critical to this work. This approach will need to better enable Defence to
sustain a diverse range of specialist training and skills development, and
will be further articulated in the strategic workforce plan being developed
as part of the implementation of the First Principles Review.

### Funding the Integrated Investment Program

48 The Integrated Investment Program of approximately $195 billion
over the decade to FY 2025–26, including already approved major
investments, has been developed within the agreed funding guidance for
the Defence portfolio.


-----

## 23


49 The Government directed that the Defence White Paper align Defence
strategy, capability and resources. To ensure that the Government had
higher levels of confidence in the cost and schedule attributed to future
investment, Defence undertook a comprehensive program of external
cost assurance, with a particular focus on the development of the
future force, in support of a fully costed White Paper. This is the most
comprehensive cost assurance that has been undertaken for a Defence
White Paper.

50 Defence engaged a panel of private sector specialists, including
Australian and internationally-based experts, who are globally
recognised for their cost analysis and assessment services, to undertake
detailed resource analysis and to provide cost and schedule assurance
of Defence’s major investment plan.

51 On balance, Defence assesses that the independent cost assurance
process was invaluable in informing the work of the Defence White
Paper, in particular in terms of guiding judgements on cost and
capability trade-offs. The cost assurance work provided a greater level
of transparency and rigour in the development of a balanced investment
program than would have been possible had this work been conducted
solely in-house.

52 Defence will embed external cost assurance that draws on private sector
expertise as part of a new contestability function in Defence to ensure
that the acquisition of Defence capability is aligned with strategy and
resources and can be delivered.

 ` ` Decision-Making Superiority

### Capability Stream: Intelligence, surveillance, reconnaissance, electronic warfare, space
 and cyber

1.1 Over the decade to FY 2025–26, Defence will invest around nine
per cent of the Integrated Investment Program to enhance Australia’s
intelligence, surveillance, reconnaissance, electronic warfare, space and
cyber capabilities. Evolving threats and changes in technology require
further investment to develop and maintain a capability edge, including
through strengthening our decision-making superiority.

1.2 Existing capabilities and approved acquisitions that contribute to
Australia’s intelligence, surveillance, reconnaissance, electronic warfare,
space and cyber capabilities include:

`` the air defence network (including the Vigilaire air surveillance
network and the Jindalee operational radar network)

`` our access to a range of situational awareness information
including from space surveillance systems (C-band radar and
space surveillance telescope) supported by Australia’s alliance
with the United States and membership of the Five-Eyes
intelligence community

`` electronic warfare operational support capabilities

`` a growing cyber capability.

1.3 Defence will strengthen existing capabilities in the intelligence,
surveillance, reconnaissance, electronic warfare, space and cyber
functions. This will include acquiring:

`` modernised all-source intelligence systems supported by
enhanced processing capabilities


-----

Capability Stream: Intelligence, surveillance, reconnaissance, electronic warfare, space and cyber
## 29

`` enhanced space situational awareness

`` enhanced capacity to generate and analyse imagery

`` new and enhanced unmanned intelligence, surveillance, and
reconnaissance capabilities (including the MQ-4C Triton
unmanned aircraft system)

`` a new electronic warfare support capability based on a long-range
commercial aircraft

`` new and enhanced command, control, communications and
intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance systems.

1.4 Australia will develop its cyber capabilities to deter and defend against
the threat of cyber attack. Enhanced cyber capabilities will improve our
ability to defend our own networks and systems effectively and ensure
the ADF is able to operate securely as the global cyber threat increases.

1.5 Over the decade to FY 2025–26, significant new investment is planned
for infrastructure and facilities upgrades that primarily support the ADF’s
intelligence, surveillance, reconnaissance, electronic warfare, space
and cyber capabilities. Key proposals include upgrading facilities at
Harold E. Holt Communications Station in Exmouth, Western Australia
and at the communications facility located at HMAS Harman, Australian
Capital Territory.

##### Intelligence, surveillance, reconnaissance, electronic warfare, space and cyber workforce summary

1.6 Enhancements in the intelligence, surveillance, reconnaissance, electronic
warfare, space and cyber domains will require around 900 additional ADF
positions and around 800 APS positions (including through reshaping the
workforce) over the decade to FY 2025–26. People with suitable aptitudes
and skills for this area are in strong demand across the broader economy;
Defence personnel growth will be supported by targeted recruitment and a
joint approach to training and retention programs.


-----

DECISION-MAKING SUPERIORITY
## 30

1.7 Workforce reshaping and growth in this capability stream will support:

`` collecting and analysing intelligence, with a particular focus on
strengthening intelligence capabilities in support of deployed forces
(for example to support increased use of unmanned systems)

`` improving support to counter-terrorism operations

`` enhancing geospatial systems analysis and support, including
information and communications technology systems, and
strengthened collection and assessment capabilities

`` processing, exploiting and disseminating the large volumes of
data that will be generated by sophisticated platforms – such as
the P-8A Poseidon maritime surveillance and response aircraft,
unmanned intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance systems
(including Triton), F-35A Lightning II Joint Strike Fighter, E/A-18G
Growler, Hobart Class Air Warfare Destroyer, future frigates and
future submarines

`` generating intelligence and mission data for pre-programming
advanced platforms

`` enhancing cyber capabilities

`` developing further space command, control, communications,
computer and intelligence systems and space surveillance
sensors, including ground support functions

`` improving electronic warfare planning and coordination, and
spectrum management

`` enhancing our ability to develop electronic warfare
countermeasures to protect ADF systems

`` enhancing situational awareness across all domains and
environments.

##### Intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance

**_Air and space situational awareness_**

1.8 The future force will be characterised by more sophisticated intelligence,
surveillance, and reconnaissance systems and long-range air defence
and strike weapons employed by maritime, air and ground forces,
along with increasing reliance on space-based capabilities. To this
end, Defence will develop systems, sensors and networks to deliver
effective air and space situational awareness around Australia and in
deployed locations. A new, more sophisticated command, control,
communications, computer and intelligence system will also be required
to be able to fuse information from multiple sources. This will enable
coordination of forces and more timely operational response, including
an ability to support the more comprehensive situational awareness
required for capabilities such as integrated air and missile defence.

**_Common operating picture and tactical data links_**

1.9 Success in all operations is dependent on providing tailored and near
real-time situational awareness to commanders. In the operational sphere
this is provided by generating a trusted common operating picture.
Defence will continue with functionality enhancements to relevant
systems in order to integrate the common operating picture at all levels
and provide enhanced situational awareness across the joint force.

**_Improved processing, analysis and dissemination of intelligence and_**
**_mission data_**

1.10 A variety of data needs to be loaded pre-mission or maintained

through-mission via data links to use the capacity of new advanced
systems and platforms which have a greater capacity to process data
on board. These new systems also generate large amounts of data
available to be shared and analysed, including situational awareness
information such as the location of friendly forces, civilian populations
and aircraft, and information on the operational environment and
potential threats.


-----

DECISION-MAKING SUPERIORITY
## 32

1.11 Defence has begun addressing this new requirement in the context

of supporting the introduction of the Joint Strike Fighter. We will
continue to strengthen our ability to perform near real-time production,
exploitation and dissemination of data. This will also entail investment in
intelligence and mission data capabilities to support pre-programming
of high technology platforms such as the Growler, Joint Strike Fighter
and Poseidon aircraft, Hobart Class Air Warfare Destroyers and modern
armoured vehicles.

**_High altitude unmanned intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance_**
**_systems_**

1.12 From the early 2020s, Defence will acquire an advanced surveillance

system comprising seven MQ-4C Tritons, with supporting intelligence,
surveillance and control systems. The Triton is a remotely piloted
aircraft that is well suited to long-endurance surveillance operations
over the ocean. The Triton also enables persistent maritime patrol and
other intelligence, surveillance and reconnaissance tasks over a broad
area. The aircraft is capable of flying missions in excess of 24 hours,
with a range of over 8 000 nautical miles, while providing 360 degree
surveillance and imagery of an area of up to 2 000 square miles. The
Triton’s operations will be closely coordinated with that of the Poseidon
maritime surveillance and response aircraft.

1.13 The Triton, including the necessary supporting intelligence, surveillance

and control systems, will be upgraded throughout its life to ensure it
stays at the leading edge of technology and maintains commonality
with United States systems for supportability. Additional facilities
will be required at RAAF Bases Edinburgh and Tindal. Enhancements
will be required to information and communications technology
networks and satellite communications capacity and interfaces to other
Australian‑specific capabilities and systems.

**_Enhanced Jindalee operational radar network_**

1.14 The Jindalee operational radar network will be enhanced through a

spiral development program into the 2030s in order to realise its full


-----

Capability Stream: Intelligence, surveillance, reconnaissance, electronic warfare, space and cyber
## 33

potential as a wide area surveillance capability. Enhanced command,
control, communications, computers and intelligence integration will
allow Jindalee to cue and be cued by other systems across the sensor
network. The core role of these systems is the defence of Australia and
its surrounding airspace by identifying aircraft and some surface vessels
approaching Australia.

**_Intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance information integration_**
**_and optimisation_**

1.15 We will continue to address system obsolescence, functionality and

integration requirements with the information networks and systems of
the Defence Intelligence Organisation, Australian Geospatial-Intelligence
Organisation and the Australian Signals Directorate. These measures will
also address links with the broader Australian Intelligence Community
and systems of partners.

1.16 Defence network backbones will be strengthened to provide the

capability to store, manage, process and access large amounts of diverse
intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance information regardless of
location, organisation, activity or information source. A secure, seamless
high capacity cross-domain link between various Defence networks is a
high priority. Intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance information
will be made discoverable and available across all domains, subject to
adequate security safeguards, through new applications and a common
architecture that extends into the deployed environment.

**_Biometric data storage and management system_**

1.17 Defence will establish an identity registration and verification capability

for operational use which will build on the lessons learned from recent
operations in the Middle East and Afghanistan.

**_Maritime geospatial data management systems_**

1.18 Defence will upgrade the digital hydrographic systems at the Australian

Hydrographic Office by 2025 to support management of maritime
military geospatial information and to support national tasking for survey


-----

DECISION-MAKING SUPERIORITY
## 34

and chart production. A mix of enhanced commercial and military
hydrographic survey capabilities will increase the throughput of both
national and military hydrographic information.

##### Electronic warfare

1.19 Defence will continue with the acquisition and delivery of a force-level,

electronic warfare capability, through a suite of projects to achieve high
levels of information fusion and comprehensive planning across the joint
force and Defence intelligence agencies. This will improve the ADF’s
ability to control the electronic environment and where necessary, deny
or degrade the electronic systems of adversaries. Existing and planned
electronic warfare survivability, tactical validation and countermeasures
development programs will continue to enable more rapid countering of
emerging threats, including improvised explosive devices.

**_Long-range electronic warfare support_**

1.20 From the early 2020s, Defence will acquire up to five long-range

electronic warfare support aircraft based on the Gulfstream G550
airframe with additional and modified systems. This capability will
substantially enhance electronic warfare support to naval, air and land
forces for operations in electromagnetic environments manipulated by
hostile forces, with the operating cost, range and endurance benefits
of a commercial airframe. The aircraft will be acquired in two tranches
and incrementally upgraded to maintain commonality with the United
States-developed systems for long-term supportability and to maintain
interoperability.

##### Space

1.21 Additional investment is planned in space-related capability, including

space-based and ground-based intelligence, surveillance and
reconnaissance systems; and space situational awareness and command,
control, communications, computer and intelligence capabilities.


-----

Capability Stream: Intelligence, surveillance, reconnaissance, electronic warfare, space and cyber
## 35

**_Imagery_**

1.22 Australia’s ability to collect and use imagery data will be substantially

enhanced, including increasing the capacity for imagery analysis. This
will be achieved primarily through additional personnel and equipment
for the Australian Geospatial-Intelligence Organisation, and enhanced
access to imagery, including imagery from satellites.

1.23 Australia will continue to invest in expanding access to geospatial data

through both existing and new commercial and partner arrangements.
This data will enhance our support to regional and global operations,
and improve the resilience of our access to space-derived information,
including operational imagery and targeting.

**_Space situational awareness_**

1.24 Australia’s existing space situational awareness capability relies on

access to comprehensive United States-sourced and processed space
situational awareness information. Existing arrangements will be
strengthened through the re-location of the C-band radar and optical
space surveillance telescope to Australia, enhancing our access to
space situational awareness information. Defence will also examine
other ground-based sensors, including radar and optical systems, to
develop options for expanding Australia’s space situational awareness
sensor coverage in the future.

##### Cyber

**_Enhanced cyber capabilities_**

1.25 The cyber threat to Australia is growing. This threat represents a real

and present risk to our national security and economic prosperity.
As a priority, Australia’s cyber capability will be developed to deter
and defend against the threat of cyber attack. Enhancements will be
introduced at the strategic level, such as protecting static information
and communications technology networks, and at the operational and
tactical levels, including deployed ADF networks and systems. Defence


-----

DECISION-MAKING SUPERIORITY
## 36

will continue to work closely with other agencies to protect Australian
interests in the cyber domain, including through the multi-agency
Australian Cyber Security Centre.

1.26 One of the key risks to delivering an enhanced cyber capability will

continue to be in recruiting and retaining this highly skilled workforce.
The particular knowledge and skills required are currently in short
supply across Australia.

### Capability Stream: Key enablers

2.1 An important focus of the Force Structure Review was to remediate
the underinvestment of recent years in those key enablers essential
to realising the full potential of the high technology systems entering
service. Over the decade to FY 2025–26, Defence will invest around
25 per cent of the Integrated Investment Program in strengthening
the enablers required to maximise the effectiveness and operational
sustainability of Australia’s defence capability.

2.2 Priorities for investment include:

`` continuously developing, monitoring and maintaining critical
infrastructure, including airfields, wharves, port facilities, key
ADF bases, logistics systems, fuel and explosive ordnance
facilities

`` upgrading training and weapons ranges, testing facilities and
health services (that enable training and exercises to support
advanced weapons and systems and joint integration in realistic
conditions)

`` enhancing the vast Defence information and communications
technology system that supports Defence business from
peacetime activities through to combat operations

`` strengthening force design, strategic and international policy
development and international engagement that supports and
sustains Defence operations and increased presence in the region.


-----

Capability Stream: Key enablers
## 41

2.3 Investing in the ADF and APS workforce through innovative and
advanced education and training in the timeframes required will be
essential for successful implementation of the capability and strategic
goals of the Defence White Paper represented in this Integrated
Investment Program. The Defence workforce is an essential enabler of
existing and future capability.

##### Key enablers workforce summary

2.4 As a result of the Force Structure Review’s emphasis on strengthening
enabling capabilities across the broad spectrum of Defence capabilities,
the largest proposed area of increase in the Defence workforce is in
the enabling function; around an additional 1 100 ADF and 400 APS
positions are required to support the enabler stream.

2.5 The principal areas of focus are:

`` information and communications technology network support

`` logistics, operational and security support in Australia and at
deployed locations

`` advanced joint training systems including enterprise modelling
and simulation

`` training ranges and testing facilities

`` enhanced support to maritime logistics

`` integrated force design, analysis and assurance

`` strategic and international policy

`` expanded security vetting.

##### Infrastructure and Defence estate

2.6 Facilities such as airfields, wharves, training areas, explosive ordnance
storage, fuel installations and test and experimentation assets are critical
for the generation and sustainment of Defence capability. Increased


-----

ENABLED, MOBILE AND SUSTAINABLE FORCES
## 42

investment in these facilities has been accorded a high priority in this
Integrated Investment Program to ensure that these key enablers remain
fit for purpose to support Defence operations.

2.7 The Defence estate (some 600 sites with around 30 000 assets) has a
gross replacement value of approximately $68 billion. Sustaining such
a large and geographically dispersed asset base requires considerable
funding for both maintenance and capital investment.

2.8 The more capable, more active and internationally engaged future force
will require significant additional investment in supporting infrastructure
to enable us to meet our agreed strategic objectives, including the need
to strengthen Defence’s presence in northern Australia.

2.9 Infrastructure requirements relating to our enhanced presence in
northern Australia include upgrades to bases such as RAAF Tindal
(Northern Territory), RAAF Learmonth (Western Australia), HMAS
Coonawarra (Northern Territory) as well as to facilities on Cocos
(Keeling) Islands. In addition, there are infrastructure requirements
related to the United States Force Posture Initiative in northern Australia,
along with a heightened program of military engagement including
increased joint and multilateral training and exercises with other
security partners. We also need to adapt to changes in land use within
communities around Defence sites (leading to increasing encroachment
of some facilities) along with environmental pressures.

2.10 As a key enabler of Defence capability, our increased infrastructure

investment will not be limited to expanding or remediating existing
facilities. It will also involve modifying the Defence estate footprint
to accommodate our new high technology capabilities and larger
platforms, and to ensure that we are appropriately placed to meet
future strategic requirements. Over the next 50 years, this will involve
developing new bases, wharves, airfields and training and weapons
testing ranges. Equally importantly, it will involve disposing of property
and facilities that no longer meet our requirements.


-----

Capability Stream: Key enablers
## 43

**_Long-term infrastructure investment_**

2.11 The Force Structure Review examined the strategic, longer-term

requirements of the ADF, in terms of infrastructure and facilities to
accommodate the high technology capabilities of the future force
(including larger naval vessels), along with increased Defence activity,
engagement and presence in the north.

2.12 Most of the expenditure on the longer-term initiatives listed below

is programmed beyond 2026; this will allow time for the necessary
planning, design and consultation with relevant stakeholders, in
particular state and territory governments, industry and the broader
community. Work will commence this decade on studies to inform the
more detailed scope definition, environmental assessment and cost
analysis work that will be essential to the successful progression of
these initiatives.

2.13 These longer-term initiatives will not preclude urgent enhancement and

maintenance works from being undertaken at existing facilities over the
next decade. However, in planning and implementing any such work the
longer-term goals outlined below will be taken into account.

2.14 Long-term infrastructure priorities include:

`` developing long-term options to establish naval facilities with
greater capacity in the Northern Territory to support Australia’s
larger future maritime force

`` adding loading capacity in the north, including options for a
possible new roll-on/roll-off wharf in northern Australia to support
our amphibious capability

`` developing options to enhance air base capacity in the Northern
Territory to support the future ADF’s air combat, intelligence,
surveillance, reconnaissance, air-to-air refueller and air transport
fleets, appropriately buffered from civil encroachment and with
capacity to support visiting aircraft of allies and partners


-----

ENABLED, MOBILE AND SUSTAINABLE FORCES
## 44

`` developing options for establishing a new Northern Advanced
Joint Training Area with the capacity for large-scale, joint and
combined amphibious training, noting the only other large‑scale
training area with joint amphibious training capacity is at
Shoalwater Bay in Queensland

`` establishing a rail link from the main line to RAAF Tindal to
support the transport and handling of explosive ordnance and
bulk fuel; this will help to alleviate Defence’s fuel storage and
distribution limitations in the north.

2.15 The longer-term priorities outlined above involve substantial new

investment in additional infrastructure and facilities in northern Australia
to support the capability and capacity needs of a high technology
future force and a more active posture. These priorities align with the
Australian Government’s policy to strengthen Defence’s presence in
northern Australia.

2.16 These proposals will support the future force’s heightened engagement

with allies and regional security partners, including the United States
Force Posture Initiative. Importantly, the proposed infrastructure
and facilities development in the north will address key existing
vulnerabilities and capacity constraints that are set to worsen over time
if not remedied.

**_Short to medium-term infrastructure investment_**

2.17 The short to medium-term proposals below have been prioritised

for increased investment, with the additional investment likely to be
programmed within this decade to FY 2025–26 and into the following
decade to FY 2035–36.

**_Advanced joint training systems, ranges and testing_**

2.18 The current ranges and training areas are becoming degraded and

in some cases are becoming increasingly not fit for purpose. A high
priority in this Integrated Investment Program is to ensure that these


-----

Capability Stream: Key enablers
## 45

training and testing facilities are appropriately upgraded to support the
introduction of new ADF weapons systems in the coming decades, as
well as ADF electromagnetic warfare and intelligence, surveillance,
and reconnaissance systems. This will allow more realistic training to
take advantage of the full capacity of advanced weapons and systems.
Integration with non-kinetic effects and simulation systems will also be
a priority.

2.19 Advanced joint training systems will include platform simulators and

systems that link multiple real life activities and simulators together
to allow for large-scale joint training and mission rehearsal. An urgent
priority for investment is the enterprise-wide simulation capability that
will bring together all systems and data networks for an enhanced training
capacity. An enterprise-wide simulation capability will improve both
individual and collective ADF training outcomes by making training more
realistic. It will also assist in deepening understanding of the full cost of
ownership of capabilities. Some new platforms and systems for the future
force will also require specific advanced simulation capabilities.

2.20 The pilot and air combat officer training systems will be upgraded

to support more complex aircraft and aviation systems, including
unmanned aircraft, and the increasing number of aerial platforms
in the future force. The already approved Pilot Training System and
Helicopter Aircrew Training System will provide an effective system
for training the ADF’s future pilots for various advanced aircraft types,
supported by new modern training aircraft and the latest in simulator
technology to enhance learning opportunities for student pilots. The
Integrated Investment Program also includes a substantial provision
for a new lead-in fighter training system to support those students who
go on to complete the ADF’s fast jet pilot training. Together these key
investments will support the advanced pilot training requirements of the
high technology future force, providing the flexibility and capacity to
create a more efficient training pipeline.


-----

ENABLED, MOBILE AND SUSTAINABLE FORCES
## 46

2.21 Training range upgrades will include a variety of estate infrastructure;

communications and environmental controls to manage training
activities sustainably; new instrumentation, targets and threat simulation,
to support more advanced training including with long-range and
high-speed weapons; and infrastructure and equipment for maintaining
target areas including for clearing of unexploded ordnance. Defence will
increase investment over the next ten years to restore the training ranges
and facilities required to support the existing force as well as supporting
the introduction of larger, more capable and high technology platforms.

2.22 The Integrated Investment Program provides for further investment in a

number of ADF training areas in northern Australia including for roads
and accommodation; environmental measures such as fencing and waste
management; through to the installation of advanced targeting including
simulation and instrumentation in Shoalwater Bay (Queensland),
Bradshaw Field Training Area (Northern Territory) and Yampi Sound
(Western Australia) to better support joint training. Upgrades will also
be undertaken at a range of ADF bases such as Lavarack Barracks
(Queensland), Robertson and Larrakeyah Barracks and RAAF Darwin
(Northern Territory) which are used regularly in preparing forces.

**_Key operational bases_**

2.23 Many key existing ADF bases are in need of significant remediation

or expansion, including Garden Island in Sydney. New platforms such
as the Canberra Class amphibious ships and Hobart Class Air Warfare
Destroyers will require more capable facilities. HMAS Stirling in Western
Australia faces similar issues with larger vessels, and the expanded fleet
of submarines. As the fleet becomes larger over the years, both in the
number and size of ships (including planned larger vessels to replace
the Armidale Class patrol boats), all naval bases will need attention.

2.24 Garden Island is currently the primary base that supports maritime

operations from Australia’s east coast. Defence assesses that Garden
Island will need over $700 million in works over the next ten years


-----

Capability Stream: Key enablers
## 47

to enable it to continue to support an expanded fleet, including the
_Canberra Class amphibious ships. The works will include investment in_
the Captain Cook Graving Dock, East Dock Wharf, oil and gun wharves.
Defence will undertake further work over the next few years to assess the
longer-term feasibility of the Garden Island facility.

2.25 Substantial new investment in HMAS Stirling over the decade to

FY 2025–26 will include the fire and damage control centre, wharf
works not already included in the current redevelopment project,
operations headquarters and underwater tracking range.

2.26 Defence will also carefully consider the future of RAAF Darwin and

HMAS Coonawarra. Planned works to enhance operational effectiveness
in the short to medium-term will continue ahead of the longer-term
development of options for potentially establishing larger capacity bases
in the Northern Territory.

**_National airfields_**

2.27 Additional investment in Defence and joint user (military/civilian)

airfields has been programmed to address deficiencies and to ensure
our modern aircraft are able to be supported. Upgrades will include
runways, taxiways and hardstand refurbishments in line with risks
identified through an annual program of inspections, along with airfield
ground lighting upgrades and compliance works. A high priority
has been placed on monitoring and maintenance to maintain the
effectiveness of our airfields once they have been remediated.

2.28 To support the Joint Strike Fighter, new and upgraded facilities and

infrastructure will be established over the course of this decade to
FY 2025–26 at RAAF Bases Williamtown, Tindal, Townsville, Darwin,
Curtin, Scherger, Learmonth, Pearce and Edinburgh.

2.29 To support the introduction of the new P-8A Poseidon maritime

surveillance and response aircraft, RAAF Bases Edinburgh, Darwin,
Pearce, and Townsville, and the airfield at the Cocos (Keeling) Islands
will be upgraded.

**_Explosive ordnance storage facilities_**

2.30 The Explosive Ordnance Logistic Remediation Program will continue
with the priorities being remediation of Point Wilson port infrastructure
and Port Wakefield and Graytown proofing and experimentation
facilities. Work will also be undertaken across numerous facilities to
address legislative and regulatory compliance requirements including
replacement of some ageing facilities. Work at Defence Establishment
Myambat will also be conducted to support the introduction of new
weapons including for the Joint Strike Fighter.

2.31 A new northern explosive ordnance storage facility will be constructed to

address the capacity constraints of the sole explosive ordnance facility
in the Northern Territory. The existing facility located at RAAF Darwin
has limited scope for expansion but it will require some enhancements.
The new explosive ordnance storage facility will better support the future
force and enable higher tempo operations in northern Australia.

**_Fuel supply_**

2.32 The Defence fuel supply chain, including installations and infrastructure,

is a key enabler for the generation of Defence capability. Fuel storage
and distribution installations will be remediated to improve Defence’s
fuel resilience and capacity to transport bulk fuel to support its bases
and operations. New investment programmed across the decade to
FY 2025–26 includes upgrades to existing Defence fuel infrastructure
and improved access to commercial fuel supplies, particularly to
support high tempo operations in northern Australia. Airfield fuel trucks
will be replaced and deployable fuel supply equipment for amphibious
operations will also be upgraded.

**_Support bases_**

2.33 Support bases are important to house and train the ADF personnel of the

future – they are often a recruit’s first experience of military life. Modern
training facilities and accommodation will support improved recruitment
and retention and enhanced training capacity to support delivery of the
future force.

## 49

2.34 Some of the most important (albeit non-operational) bases are also

amongst the least funded and in need of priority remediation, for
example HMAS Cerberus. As non-operational bases, these facilities
have typically been underfunded as priority for funding has gone to new
capability or more operationally focused bases.

**_Logistics_**

2.35 The Defence Logistics Transformation Program will be completed in

2016 to transform Defence’s logistics contracts, facilities and systems.
The program is modernising and enhancing Defence wholesale storage,
distribution and land materiel functions and providing enhanced
logistics facilities at Moorebank (New South Wales), East Bandiana,
(Victoria), Amberley and Townsville (Queensland), Palmerston (Northern
Territory), Edinburgh (South Australia), and Guildford and HMAS Stirling
(Western Australia).

2.36 Logistics information and communications technology systems will be

rationalised and improved, particularly in Defence central cataloguing
and the use of radio frequency identity technology, and by the
introduction of a more comprehensive and integrated logistics enterprise
resource planning suite.

**_Woomera range complex_**

2.37 The Woomera range complex is a critical national asset; it is an

internationally unique facility able to support leading-edge systems. It
provides a large, secure and remote training and testing area that could
not be replicated anywhere else in Australia without major investment.
Woomera is used largely by the Defence Science and Technology
Group and the Air Force for testing and evaluating aeronautical weapons
systems. With increased cooperation and joint exercises and training
with the United States and other security partners, the demands on
facilities such as Woomera are likely to increase. As such, additional
investment is programmed within the decade to FY 2025–26 to ensure
Woomera continues to support increasing demands.

**_Advanced computing support to operational research and_**
**_countermeasures development_**

2.38 The increasing sophistication of modern high technology weapons

systems and the growing complexity of the strategic environment,
including emerging technologies and threats, are placing additional
demand on our existing scientific and technical support base, including
in the areas of operational research and countermeasures development.
New investment will establish a centralised networked supercomputer
capability that will support advanced research, development, modelling
and experimentation across Defence.

**_Maintenance_**

2.39 Maintenance of the Defence estate, including measures to address

workplace health and safety issues, has been underfunded in recent
years. Over time, continued underfunding will lead to degradation of
facilities and increased exposure of Australian Government personnel
to workplace health and safety risk. Additional funding has been
allocated in this Integrated Investment Program to allow Defence to
address estate maintenance issues on a more systemic basis, thereby
protecting the estate and its workforce and reducing the cost of future
works. Substantial works will also be required at selected locations to
remediate environmental issues.

**_Reserves, cadets and other support sites_**

2.40 The Reserves and cadets remain an important source of recruits for

our permanent forces, and provide a tangible link to Defence in many
communities across Australia. Investment in general refurbishments and
compliance works across multiple establishments supporting Reserves
and cadets, as well as other support sites, will continue over the decade
to FY 2025–26. This will ensure that Reserves and cadets are provided
with contemporary and safe environments.


-----

## 51

**_Defence estate rationalisation_**

2.41 Rationalisation and disposal of surplus sites is a priority for Defence.

This activity is essential so that, over time, Defence can reshape its
estate footprint to meet the ADF’s future strategic requirements as
efficiently and effectively as possible. Achieving a strategically aligned
Defence estate footprint will gradually reduce the resources required
to maintain facilities that are surplus to Defence’s requirements.
Additionally, any savings realised through the sale of Defence bases will
be reinvested in Defence capability.

##### Information and communications technology

**_The Defence information and communications technology environment_**

2.42 Information and communications technology is an essential

enabler for the increasingly high-technology ADF and the Defence
organisation more broadly. Defence is critically dependent on
information and communications technology across the breadth of its
activities, including command and control, intelligence, surveillance,
reconnaissance, communications, electronic warfare, logistics,
budgeting, personnel management and corporate administration.

2.43 Information and communications technology provides Defence with

access to global communication channels and a complex range of
specialist military, commercial, government and bespoke applications.
Defence operates a wide variety of geographically dispersed, fixed,
deployable and mobile networks that depend on access to modern and
reliable information and communications-related equipment.

2.44 In addition to the challenges posed by its breadth and diversity, the

Defence information and communications technology environment
is also one of the largest in Australia: it currently supports more than
100 000 workstations across Australia and overseas. The current


-----

ENABLED, MOBILE AND SUSTAINABLE FORCES
## 52

environment of around 800 networks, over 200 processing locations,
and more than 3 000 applications needs to be streamlined substantially
to more manageable levels to improve both the effectiveness and the
efficiency of the domain.

**_Remediating underinvestment in the Defence information and_**
**_communications technology environment_**

2.45 There has been underinvestment in key enablers over the decade,

including in the area of information and communications technology.
This underinvestment has been compounded by Defence’s struggle to
establish a coherent enterprise-level strategy for its complex and rapidly
evolving information and communications technology domain.

2.46 One of the highest priorities in the development of the Integrated

Investment Program has been to address the systemic underinvestment
in information and communications technology that has led to serious
degradation across the network. Key areas of the network need urgent
remediation, in particular to address the shortcomings of outdated and
in some cases obsolete systems that inhibit the conduct of day-to-day
business within Defence, with overseas allies and partners, and with
industry and the community more broadly.

2.47 While the process of remediation has commenced, the injection of

substantial additional funding through the Integrated Investment Program
is designed to consolidate early gains. It is also essential that Defence
accelerates its efforts to modernise its information and communications
technology infrastructure to take advantage of the rapidly advancing
digital transformation that is occurring across the Australian economy
more broadly. Defence will work with the Digital Transformation Office to
ensure that Defence’s plans reflect best practice.

2.48 Defence will need to be more agile and flexible if it is to meet its

information and communications technology requirements in the decade
ahead effectively. As technology life cycles continue to shorten, it will be


-----

Capability Stream: Key enablers
## 53

critical that Defence is able to move more quickly to acquire information
and communications systems; this will ensure that Defence maintains a
technological edge, while also simplifying maintenance and security.

**_Priority areas of investment_**

2.49 The priority areas for investment in Defence information and

communications technology fall broadly into the following three
categories:

`` enhancing support to operations

`` stabilising Defence’s information and communications
technology core

`` delivering a rationalised, secure, contemporary information and
communications technology environment.

2.50 These priority areas for investment in information and communications

technology complement the work that is underway through the First
Principles Review to modernise the way in which Defence plans and
manages its information environment.

2.51 The Integrated Investment Program allocates more than $5 billion in

additional funding over previous plans to meet Defence’s information
and communications technology needs across the decade to
FY 2025-26. This increase in funding will restore investment to the
level needed to transform the fixed, deployed and mobile information
and communications technology environments. The challenge that
Defence faces in supporting its increasing needs for integrated,
real‑time, high performance, high capacity, secure and in some
cases mobile information and communications systems is immense.
Success will require careful planning and collaboration across the
Defence organisation, close relationships with industry partners, and
a preparedness to take judicious risks, especially in the more rapidly
evolving areas of information and communications technology.


-----

ENABLED, MOBILE AND SUSTAINABLE FORCES
## 54

**_Enhancing support to operations_**

2.52 The major areas of proposed investment to support the ADF on operations
include:

`` the modernisation of command and control systems across the
spectrum from strategic fixed locations (such as Headquarters Joint
Operations Command in the Canberra region), through to tactical
deployed formations (such as forces deployed overseas in the
field or on ships)

`` further investment in information systems that enable the ADF
and the Defence organisation more broadly to communicate and
exchange information with allies and partners, including across
classified computer networks, and in both fixed and deployed
environments

`` substantial investment in emerging mobility and digitisation
technologies that will be able to be applied in both the operational
and non-operational environments – whether to support ADF
elements on operations, logistics-related applications, or indeed
corporate and administrative applications in the domestic
environment

`` enhanced computer network defence in support of deployed forces

`` modernised health systems, including in support of deployed forces
overseas.

**_Stabilising Defence’s information and communications technology core_**

2.53 A critical step towards transforming Defence’s information and

communications technology environment will be to stabilise the core of
the system by providing standardised, robust and reliable networks. The
key initiatives to stabilise the core of the systems are the delivery of a
Single Information Environment, and a program to transform Defence’s
information and communications technology core infrastructure,
including through the following investments:


-----

Capability Stream: Key enablers
## 55

`` a terrestrial communications project, which is upgrading,
replacing and standardising the backbone of the Defence
information and communications technology system

`` the Next Generation Desktop project, which is improving the end
user computing environment in Defence by delivering Defence
networks and applications through a single desktop

`` the Centralised Processing project, which is consolidating and
updating Defence’s computing infrastructure and re-hosting
applications from around 280 data centres to 11 within Australia
and 3 overseas; this project will address obsolescence, lack
of standardisation and the current high costs of ownership of
a distributed information and communications technology
environment.

**_Delivering a rationalised, secure, contemporary information and_**
**_communications technology environment_**

2.54 A rationalised, secure Defence information and communications
technology environment will result in more efficient capabilities that
reduce duplicated effort and allow for more secure data management
and user access across required services and systems. Substantial work
will be undertaken to consolidate, rationalise and simplify the current
array of Defence applications. This program of work will also fund
software remediation and improved enterprise licensing arrangements.

2.55 Continuous improvement activities over the decade to FY 2025–26

will include refreshing infrastructure periodically and enhancing the
responsiveness of Defence information and communications technology
support to meet future business needs and operational capability
requirements.

2.56 Key priorities include:

`` maintaining software and hardware standards that are adaptable to
support the new high technology capabilities entering service


-----

ENABLED, MOBILE AND SUSTAINABLE FORCES
## 56

`` developing and maintaining enterprise systems that support
contemporary business practices

`` establishing trusted information sharing services to support
Australian government agencies and allies in coalition operations.

2.57 As referred to earlier in the section on enhanced support to operations,
investment in Defence’s next generation mobile information and
communications technology systems will improve mobility for Defence
users by providing secure, effective and reliable mobile access to
information in both the operational and business contexts.

2.58 Enhancements in Defence’s information and communications

technology systems and business processes to support the
implementation of First Principles Review recommendations
will include:

`` establishing an Enterprise Information Management Program
to enhance decision-making through access to a unified
information environment, enabling improved information and data
management across Defence

`` standardising business processes to provide end-to-end visibility
of Defence business through streamlined processes and a
consolidated Defence Enterprise Resource Planning system
that will improve core business functions, including force
preparedness planning

`` delivering an enterprise-wide framework for identity and access
management to provide users with trusted access to applications,
facilities and information and communications technology assets.

**_Satellite and terrestrial communications infrastructure_**

2.59 Defence will continue satellite-based communications upgrades, such

as ground station segments and mobile and deployable land terminals.
In doing this, we will ensure follow-on satellite communications projects


-----

Capability Stream: Key enablers
## 57

meet Australia’s future bandwidth requirements and as is increasingly
important, ensure our satellite communications capabilities provide
secure communications, resilience and redundancy, along with high
bandwidth communications capabilities.

2.60 Existing facilities at Harold E. Holt Communications Facility in Exmouth,

Western Australia will also be upgraded over the decade to FY 2025–26.
This will include infrastructure upgrades to support a space surveillance
telescope that will be installed and set to work in this new facility in 2016.

##### Next generation technologies: potential threats and opportunities

2.61 The relatively small size of the ADF and the Government’s expectations

that it will be able to conduct a wide range of operations, coupled with
the increasingly sophisticated nature of military capability, makes the
effective leveraging of science and technology a critical priority for
Defence. Superior technology will often enable a smaller force to prevail
over a larger adversary.

2.62 Science and technology is a key enabler of the ADF’s operational

capability. Investment in science and technology helps to ensure the
ADF remains resilient to emerging threats, including the possible
use of disruptive technologies by adversaries. It also enables us to
be innovative and to take advantage of new or developing areas of
technology that have the potential to provide a capability edge for
Australia’s relatively small force. A high priority has been placed on
strengthening Defence’s ability to understand and respond to potentially
game-changing next generation science and technology-related threats
and opportunities, including through targeted investment to support
specific areas of research and advanced systems development. This
will be a key component of the enduring force design process to be
introduced through the implementation of First Principles Review
recommendations.


-----

ENABLED, MOBILE AND SUSTAINABLE FORCES
## 58

2.63 The Integrated Investment Program includes a program of work to enable

Defence to better understand and respond to potential threats and
opportunities. Around $730 million has been allocated over the decade
to FY 2025–26 to support targeted science and technology. The key
drivers likely to influence development of the future force from a science
and technology perspective include:

`` increasing global threats in cyber and electronic warfare domains

`` increasing global access to technology necessitating a capability
edge derived through decision-making superiority and enhanced
human performance

`` the need for agile, evolutionary upgrade of military equipment
to keep pace with technology advances and evolving (often
asymmetric) threats

`` the force multiplier effect of a highly adaptable and integrated joint
force

`` the need for more persistent, pervasive and timely intelligence,
surveillance, and reconnaissance capabilities

`` the significant advantage that could be achieved by reducing the
cost of force preparedness and sustainment while increasing force
availability.

2.64 Early application of science and technology reduces the cost, technical

and capability risks of procuring systems and introducing these systems
into service. Science and technology is essential to support the ADF
on operations, sustain and enhance current capability, acquire new
capability and future-proof against emerging threats.

2.65 Appropriate investment in science and technology will enable

Defence to prevent technology surprise, solve technical capability
challenges and provide cost-effective access to global science and
technology advances for the ADF. Our investment in Defence science
and technology will also enhance Australia’s performance as a smart
developer, buyer, user, maintainer and upgrader of Defence equipment,


-----

Capability Stream: Key enablers
## 59

and extend opportunities for greater collaboration with our allies and
international security partners.

2.66 Examples of priority areas of work are outlined below:

`` integrated intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance ‑ effective
enterprise intelligence, surveillance, reconnaissance integration
and interoperability with our allies will provide a capability edge
through superior battlespace awareness

`` space systems – de-risking Defence’s dependence on
space‑based systems through technical expertise and enhanced
capability agility

`` enhanced human performance – including enhancing soldiers’
resilience and data interpretation abilities

`` medical countermeasure products – establishing and coordinating
a national infrastructure for the rapid development of medical
countermeasure products to provide effective protection of
Defence personnel from a range of chemical, biological and
radiological threats, pandemics and emerging infectious diseases

`` multi-disciplinary materiel systems – investigating technological
advances to reduce detection of ADF platforms and improve
ballistic and shock protection

`` quantum technologies – including increasing the security of
military and government communications and computing through
strengthened encryption

`` trusted autonomous systems – researching developments
in trusted autonomous systems that may have the potential
to support ADF capability in the future, such as the use of
autonomous vehicles for resupply

`` cyber operations – establishing a research and development
capability to address the threats presented by information and
communications technology dependencies and vulnerabilities
within military systems


-----

ENABLED, MOBILE AND SUSTAINABLE FORCES
## 60

`` new technologies – researching technologies emerging globally,
including advanced sensors, hypersonic and directed energy
technologies, to remain informed of potential future threats or
opportunities.

##### Defence Posture – more active and internationally engaged

2.67 A more active and internationally engaged Defence posture will involve

an increased operational tempo for the ADF and its enabling elements,
in particular in support of the government-agreed strategic direction for
international engagement.

2.68 Defence will conduct a broader and deeper program of engagement with

international partners, with a focus on maritime South East Asia and the
South Pacific, to take a more active role in shaping Australia’s strategic
environment. This will involve a proactive pattern of peacetime activities,
exercises and operations in the region, with priority on South East Asia
and the South Pacific.

### Capability Stream: Air and sea lift

3.1 Over the decade to FY 2025–26, Defence will invest around six per cent
of the Integrated Investment Program into enhancing Australia’s air and
sea lift capabilities.

3.2 Given the substantial distances over which the ADF must
operate – nationally, regionally and globally – air and sea lift
capabilities are essential. A flexible force of air and sea lift capabilities
will enable the ADF to reach, resupply, and sustain missions in different
locations and to move around the area of operations in a timely
and reliable manner. The growth in Defence capabilities (including
personnel numbers, and the size and weight of equipment) will place
additional pressures on these capabilities. Enhancements underway in
Defence logistic support systems and facilities will enable better use
of technology in our resupply and maintenance processes, and this will
ultimately improve support to ADF operations.

3.3 The existing capabilities and approved acquisitions that contribute to air
and sea lift are:

`` transport aircraft (8 C-17A Globemaster III, 12 C-130J Hercules
and 10 C-27J Spartans)

`` air-to-air refuelling aircraft (7 KC-30A Tankers)

`` helicopters (7 CH-47F Chinooks and 47 MRH-90 Troop lift
helicopters)

`` a logistics support ship (HMAS Choules)


-----

Capability Stream: Air and sea lift
## 67

`` acquisition of a new large-hulled multi-purpose patrol vessel, the
Australian Defence Vessel Ocean Protector, for the Navy to support
border protection and maritime resource security-related tasks with
the Australian Border Force.

3.4 The Canberra Class amphibious ships can also provide substantial
support for sea lift as a secondary role.

3.5 New investments in this capability stream include:

`` additional air-to-air refuellers

`` acquiring three additional Chinooks to expand battlefield lift
capacity and support tactical missions (including aero-medical
evacuation)

`` 2 new replenishment vessels with an additional vessel (a
replenishment ship or logistics support vessel) to be acquired in
the late 2020s

`` extending the life of, and upgrading HMAS Choules

`` considering future additional heavy-lift transport aircraft.

3.6 In the longer-term, consideration will be given to acquiring a
long‑range, aero-medical evacuation and combat search and rescue
capability.

**_Air and sea lift workforce summary_**

3.7 As a result of enhancements to the current and planned air and sea lift
fleets around 800 additional ADF positions will be needed to support:

`` two additional Globemaster heavy-lift aircraft (already approved),
with further aircraft to be acquired in the future

`` two additional KC-30A air-to-air refuelling aircraft (already
approved), with a further two aircraft to be acquired in the future

`` ten C-27J Spartan aircraft

**_Air and sea lift infrastructure summary_**

3.8 Substantial investment in support of air lift is programmed for upgraded
infrastructure at RAAF Amberley, Queensland, including facilities to
support an increased number of tactical, medium and strategic lift
aircraft. Funding is also programmed for works at RAAF Base Richmond,
New South Wales, in the latter years of the decade to FY 2025–26.

3.9 Australia’s growing sea lift capability will be supported by planned
upgrades to wharves and port facilities, including substantial investment
in Fleet Base East (such as the Garden Island (East) Redevelopment
Critical Infrastructure Remediation Project), combined with continued
commercial arrangements for ADF access to civilian infrastructure.

**_Transport aircraft_**

3.10 The Globemaster, Hercules and Spartan capabilities collectively provide

strategic and intra-theatre air lift and movement around Australia and
the world, as well as facilitating airborne operations and aero-medical
evacuation. This combination of aircraft will provide a capable and
flexible air lift fleet to at least 2030.

3.11 The eight Globemasters (and any additional heavy-lift aircraft in the

future) are capable of moving large cargo and numbers of personnel
great distances, such as from Australia to the Middle East. These aircraft
will be upgraded in the mid-2020s to ensure that they remain at the
leading edge in terms of communications, sensors and self-protection
capabilities as these aircraft will continue to operate into the 2030s.
These upgrades will align with the United States’ Air Force capability
to the greatest possible extent, and the aircraft will continue to be
maintained through the global support program.


-----

Capability Stream: Air and sea lift
## 69

3.12 The existing aircraft support and loading infrastructure at a range

of air bases across Australia will be expanded to accommodate the
additional heavy-lift aircraft capacity and associated equipment. This will
include new hangars, tarmac and aprons, and new facilities to support
additional squadron and base support personnel at RAAF Amberley.
Other bases and airfields will also require upgrades in coming years to
accommodate the increase in aircraft cargo volume and activity levels.

3.13 The 12 Hercules are ideally suited to moving stores and equipment

within the region and are capable of operating from austere airfields. The
Hercules upgrades will, to the greatest extent possible, align with the
United States’ Air Force capability to ensure it remains current and to
reduce upgrade and support costs.

3.14 Ten Spartans are currently being acquired and will allow movement of

personnel and small cargos to remote locations as they are capable
of using shorter landing strips not suitable for any other fixed wing
military aircraft. This is particularly useful if operating from countries in
the South Pacific and in Papua New Guinea. The new Spartan fleet will
be based at RAAF Amberley; facilities will be enhanced to support the
new aircraft, which are expected to remain in service until around 2040.
Defence will seek opportunities to maintain the aircraft in common with
other users, where possible, to reduce upgrade costs throughout its life.

**_Air-to-air refuelling_**

3.15 The range and number of ADF aircraft that the KC-30A air-to-air refueller

aircraft will be able to refuel in flight is increasing and will include the
Joint Strike Fighter, Super Hornets, Growlers, Wedgetail, other air-to-air
refuellers, Globemasters and Poseidon.

3.16 The current ADF air-to-air refuelling capability, including a recently

approved acquisition of two additional aircraft, comprises a fleet of
seven air-to-air refuellers, with future consideration to expand the fleet to
nine aircraft to meet increasing demand.


-----

ENABLED, MOBILE AND SUSTAINABLE FORCES
## 70

3.17 The air-to-air refuelling fleet will undergo systems software and hardware

upgrades (including to the aircraft’s self-protection systems) throughout
its life to ensure its safe and effective operation.

3.18 The current air-to-air refuellers are larger, heavier and capable of

carrying more fuel than their predecessors. To ensure the aircraft are
able to operate to their full potential to support refuelling operations (by
taking off with a full fuel-load in hot weather) RAAF bases Learmonth
and Tindal will need to be upgraded by strengthening and lengthening
the runways. The fuel infrastructure at both bases will also need to be
upgraded to ensure sufficient fuel is available and the means to refuel
the aircraft efficiently is in place.

3.19 At the air-to-air refuellers’ home base at RAAF Amberley, additional

facilities will be required to support the increased number of aircraft and
associated personnel. These include:

`` accommodation

`` maintenance facilities

`` fuel storage

`` tarmac and hangar modifications.

**_Utility helicopters_**

3.20 The Chinook heavy-lift and MRH-90 Troop lift helicopters provide a

range of functions to the joint force including logistics support, tactical
mobility and limited fire support and reconnaissance. The Chinooks
predominately support the land force (including amphibious operations)
in moving heavy equipment around the battlefield and undertaking
tactical aero-medical evacuation, while the MRH-90 helicopter is
operated by Army for tactical air mobility and by Navy as a maritime


-----

Capability Stream: Air and sea lift
## 71

support helicopter. The MRH-90 helicopters will continue to be
introduced into service, with Army operating 39 to 41 aircraft and Navy
operating 6 to 8 aircraft.

3.21 The Chinook is capable of moving stores and personnel, including

vehicles and artillery systems, around the battlefield or from ships
to the land without the need for an airfield. A new Chinook fleet is
currently being acquired: seven CH-47F Chinooks will replace our seven
CH-47D. Three additional CH-47F aircraft will be acquired in the near
term to provide a fleet of ten new Chinooks.

3.22 During its life, the CH-47F fleet will be upgraded as required to ensure that

our aircraft remain supportable through the United States logistic system.

3.23 The Government will enhance the ADF’s aero-medical evacuation

capability, commencing with the acquisition of new aero-medical
evacuation equipment for the additional Chinook helicopters in the
decade to FY 2025–26 and through ensuring appropriate obsolescence
management of the entire Chinook fleet. In the longer-term, Defence
will explore options for a long-range, aero-medical evacuation and
combat search and rescue aircraft to provide enhanced support to ADF
operations, including operating with the amphibious ships.

**_Replenishment ships_**

3.24 Two new replenishment ships will replace the current mixed fleet

of one replenishment ship and one oiler (fuel only) by the early 2020s.
Replenishment ships are able to resupply fuel, water, food and weapons
to ships at sea to extend their range and endurance. As the surface fleet
grows with the introduction of larger frigates and larger patrol vessels,
Defence will acquire another support vessel such as a third high‑capacity
replenishment ship or an additional logistics support ship similar to
HMAS Choules in the late 2020s. A third replenishment ship would


-----

ENABLED, MOBILE AND SUSTAINABLE FORCES
## 72

provide an assured capacity to continuously generate one operationally
available replenishment ship for Surface Task Group operations.

3.25 While primarily capable of providing fuel, water and stores to combat

forces underway at sea, replenishment ships are also able to transport
stores into an operational theatre by helicopter and watercraft and can
discharge stores and fuel ashore via established port infrastructure.

3.26 The new replenishment ships will be fitted with situational awareness

and communications capabilities along with semi-autonomous
point‑defence against air and surface weapon threats and torpedo
defences. This will allow them to be integrated effectively into task
group operations, while also retaining a level of independence for
missions that do not require continuous escort for their protection.

**_Logistics support ship_**

3.27 Defence will upgrade and extend the life of the ADF’s logistics support

ship HMAS Choules, which is capable of undertaking a range of tasks
across the spectrum of military operations from providing humanitarian
assistance and disaster relief to amphibious lodgement. Planned
investment includes:

`` updating the ship’s battle management and command, control,
communications, computers and intelligence capabilities to enable
it to work effectively with the Canberra Class amphibious ships

`` fitting self-defence systems for protection against torpedoes,
anti-ship missiles and fast attack craft

`` fitting aviation support systems.

3.28 The Integrated Investment Program also provides for the replacement

of this logistics support ship around 2030, as HMAS Choules
has demonstrated the benefits of this type of vessel in extending
the reach of the ADF and enhancing our capacity to deploy larger


-----

Capability Stream: Air and sea lift
## 73

and better‑equipped forces. HMAS Choules, together with the two
_Canberra Class amphibious ships, will provide scalable and flexible_
options for greater capacity sea lift and amphibious operations. A
third replenishment ship or additional logistics support ship will be
considered in the late 2020s.

3.29 The recent acquisition of a new large-hulled multi-purpose patrol

vessel, the Australian Defence Vessel Ocean Protector, to support border
protection and maritime resource security‑related tasks will add further
capacity to complement the Navy’s logistics support capability.

3.30 This capability will be supported by upgrades to Fleet Base East,

including the Garden Island (East) Redevelopment Critical Infrastructure
Remediation Projects.

### Capability Stream: Maritime and anti-submarine warfare

4.1 Over the decade to FY 2025–26, Defence will invest around 25 per cent
of the Integrated Investment Program to enhance Australia’s maritime
and anti-submarine warfare capabilities.

4.2 A force that is able to conduct more challenging maritime warfare
operations in the broader region will improve Defence’s ability to meet
future operational demands, including a greater contribution to theatre
anti-submarine warfare operations in our region. This includes the
ability to conduct a spectrum of tasks ranging from border security and
hydrographic survey, through to patrols, anti-piracy operations and
combat at sea. Australia’s maritime force will become more potent over
the next two decades through acquiring higher capability systems and
better integration of sea and air platforms.

4.3 Existing capabilities and approved acquisitions that contribute to
Australia’s maritime and anti-submarine warfare capabilities include:

`` the Collins Class submarine fleet, which will be upgraded to
ensure that it remains a potent capability through the rest of its life

`` 8 P-8A Poseidon maritime surveillance and response aircraft

`` Seahawk naval combat helicopters

`` sensor, weapons and combat system upgrades to the Anzac Class
frigates and the Hobart Class Air Warfare Destroyers

`` the current fleet of Armidale Class patrol boats supplemented by
additional patrol boats as required.


-----

Capability Stream: Maritime and anti-submarine warfare
## 79

4.4 New investments to build the capability and capacity of our maritime
force include:

`` 12 regionally superior submarines to replace Australia’s existing
fleet of 6 Collins Class submarines

`` 9 anti-submarine warfare frigates to replace Australia’s existing
fleet of 8 Anzac Class frigates

`` 12 patrol vessels capable of more extended operations than the
existing Armidale Class patrol boats

`` initially an additional 4 Poseidon aircraft, with 3 further aircraft in
the late 2020s to bring the total to 15

`` modernised mine countermeasures and an efficient combination
of military and commercial hydrographic survey capabilities

`` a new deployable land-based anti-ship missile capability.

4.5 The scale and complexity of the transformation that will take place
across Defence’s maritime and anti-submarine warfare capabilities
over the next several decades will be unprecedented. When taken
together, the projects to replace our existing fleets of submarines,
frigates, destroyers and patrol boats will be worth well over $100
billion dollars over multiple decades for the acquisition phases alone.
The level of planning, management and workforce skills that will be
required to deliver this program of investment will challenge Australia
and our international partners. A whole-of-nation, whole-of-industry
and whole‑of-capability approach across all the fundamental inputs
to capability – including workforce and infrastructure, both in Defence
and industry, will be required for Australia to succeed in this massive
endeavour.

4.6 The Government’s strategy for a permanent naval shipbuilding industry
in Australia is centred on a long-term continuous build of surface
warships and smaller naval vessels in Australia. Following completion of


-----

POTENT AND AGILE OFFENSIVE RESPONSE
## 80

a competitive evaluation process, the continuous shipbuilding strategy
will commence in 2018 with offshore patrol vessels, and in 2020 for the
future frigates.

4.7 Both Defence and Australian industry will have a heavy workload
to deliver, upgrade and sustain Australia’s future maritime force. A
challenge will be to successfully manage the transition between the
existing and new submarine, frigate and patrol boat fleets, in particular
ensuring the continued availability of required capabilities to meet the
Government’s tasking. Strategic planning across programs of work over
several decades, as opposed to the past project-by-project approach,
will be essential in meeting this challenge.

**_Maritime and anti-submarine warfare workforce summary_**

4.8 The scale and complexity of the planned investment in maritime and
anti-submarine warfare capabilities is immense. The substantially larger
maritime and anti-submarine warfare force will require an increase of
around 800 ADF positions in the decade to FY 2025–26. Submarines
and ships are ineffective without highly skilled crews. The people who
operate these platforms are as important as the platforms themselves.
The doubling in size of our submarine fleet over the next 30 or so
years will present a real challenge for Defence and for the Australian
community more broadly. A high priority will be accorded to the effective
development of the crews and support personnel, and their partners in
industry, who will be indispensable for the operation of these capabilities
in the decade to FY 2025–26. Beyond that decade, further increases in
workforce numbers will be needed as the various fleets expand.

4.9 Increasing ADF personnel numbers in this capability stream over the
course of the decade to FY 2025–26 and beyond will support:

`` the Hobart Class Air Warfare Destroyers

`` 7 additional Poseidon aircraft which will take the fleet to 15 aircraft
in the late 2020s

`` the future frigate fleet


-----

Capability Stream: Maritime and anti-submarine warfare
## 81

`` a larger submarine fleet

`` tactical unmanned intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance
aircraft systems to be deployed from a range of ships

`` a deployable land-based anti-ship missile capability.

**_Maritime and anti-submarine warfare infrastructure summary_**

4.10 Over the decade to FY 2025–26, substantial investment is

programmed for infrastructure works to support the ADF’s maritime
and anti‑submarine warfare capabilities. This includes new facilities or
upgrades to wharves and ports infrastructure, runway extensions and
other airfield upgrades, and major base accommodation and facilities
upgrades at a number of naval establishments. These infrastructure
and facilities works are needed to support the larger (in both platform
size and number) surface and sub-surface fleets entering service now
and over the coming decades. Infrastructure works at Cocos (Keeling)
Islands and RAAF Edinburgh, South Australia, are also needed to ensure
these airfields and associated facilities can support new capabilities
such as the fleet of Poseidon aircraft. Substantial funding is programmed
for urgent works at Fleet Base West (HMAS Stirling) and Fleet Base East
(Garden Island).

**_Submarines_**

4.11 Submarines are an essential part of Australia’s naval capability,

providing a strategic advantage in terms of surveillance and protection
of our maritime approaches. The Government has determined that
regionally superior submarines with a high degree of interoperability
with the United States are required to provide Australia with an
effective deterrent, including by making a meaningful contribution to
anti‑submarine warfare operations in our region. The key capabilities of
the future submarine will include: anti-submarine warfare; anti‑surface
warfare; intelligence, surveillance and reconnaissance; and support to
special operations.


-----

POTENT AND AGILE OFFENSIVE RESPONSE
## 82

4.12 The Government will increase the size of the submarine force from 6

to 12 boats. The doubling in size of the submarine fleet recognises
that Australia will face a more challenging maritime environment in the
decades ahead. By 2035, around half of the world’s submarines will
be operating in the Indo-Pacific region where Australia’s interests are
most engaged. Australia has one of the largest maritime domains in the
world and we need the capacity to defend and further our interests from
the Pacific to the Indian Oceans and from the areas to our north to the
Southern Ocean. Submarines are a powerful instrument for deterring
conflict and a potent weapon should conflict occur.

4.13 Australia’s new submarines will be supported by upgrades to enablers

and facilities such as wharves and port facilities, as well as simulators,
training and submarine rescue systems. The key strategic requirements
for the future submarines include a range and endurance similar to the
_Collins Class submarine, sensor performance and stealth characteristics_
which are superior to the Collins Class, and upgraded versions of the
AN/BYG-1 combat system and Mark 48 MOD 7 heavyweight torpedo
jointly developed between the United States and Australia as the
preferred combat system and main armament. The new submarines will
have advanced communications systems to link with other Navy ships
and aircraft to conduct anti‑submarine warfare operations.

4.14 The acquisition of the 12 future submarines will commence in 2016 with

the first submarines likely to begin entering service in the early 2030s.
Construction of the 12 new submarines will extend into the late 2040s to
2050 timeframe. The length of the construction process will mean that
Australia will need to be planning the follow-on submarine well before
the last new submarine enters service. To ensure no capability gap and
the ability to progress development of a replacement submarine in the
2050s, the Government has decided to implement a rolling acquisition
program for Australia’s submarine fleet. A rolling acquisition program
will ensure that Australia is able to maintain a fleet of 12 regionally


-----

Capability Stream: Maritime and anti-submarine warfare
## 83

superior submarines as submarine and anti-submarine technologies
develop over the coming decades.

4.15 During the long life of the new submarines, the rapid rate of

technological change and ongoing evolution of Australia’s strategic
circumstances will continue. As part of the rolling acquisition program, a
review, based on strategic circumstances at the time and developments
in submarine technology, will be conducted in the late 2020s to
consider whether the configuration of the submarines remains suitable
or whether consideration of other specifications should commence.

4.16 The Future submarine program is the largest defence procurement

program in Australia’s history. The Government has already committed
to maximising Australian industry involvement in the submarine
program, without compromising cost, capability, schedule or risk.
The Government will announce the results of a Competitive Evaluation
Process in 2016.

4.17 The Integrated Investment Program also prioritises investment in the

existing Collins Class fleet, including priority capability enhancements,
obsolescence management and fleet sustainment, to ensure Australia’s
potent and agile submarine capability is maintained through the
transition period to the introduction of the future submarine fleet. A
continual and relentless focus on ensuring that we can achieve the
highest levels of capability with the Collins fleet across this long period
will be essential.

4.18 This investment will build on recent improvements to Collins Class

availability. In 2011–12, the Collins Class availability was about half
that of the international benchmark and in the past there had been up
to three submarines undergoing long-term maintenance. Following
the 2012 Coles Review, and implementation of a comprehensive and
innovative transformation plan, there has been a major improvement
in the availability of the Collins Class, and Defence is on track to reach
the international benchmark for submarine availability by mid-2016. By


-----

POTENT AND AGILE OFFENSIVE RESPONSE
## 84

mid-2016, the submarine HMAS Farncomb will have completed the first
two-year full cycle docking in Adelaide – a maintenance activity that
formerly took over three years to complete. From then onwards, only
one Collins Class submarine will be in Adelaide for full cycle docking.
Defence will continue to work closely with industry to implement
reforms to optimise Collins Class availability, reliability and capability.

4.19 As an important part of the submarine capability, the existing contracted

Submarine Escape Rescue and Abandonment System will be replaced
in the early 2020s. The replacement system will be transportable by air
and road and deployable on a range of vessels.

4.20 Facilities and infrastructure upgrades at Fleet Base West (HMAS

Stirling) and Fleet Base East (Garden Island) are programmed and will
include provision for the larger future submarine fleet.

**_Destroyers and frigates_**

4.21 Three Hobart Class Air Warfare Destroyers will enter service by the

early 2020s and will remain in service into the 2040s. This project is
behind schedule and over budget. It is critical that lessons are learned
and adopted to ensure the Air Warfare Destroyer project is completed to
demonstrate Defence and industry’s ability to deliver a highly complex
modern naval capability. The completion of the Air Warfare Destroyer
project will also enable skilled resources to be redirected to other
high-priority naval projects and free up scarce infrastructure to enable
other projects to proceed in a timely and effective manner. These AEGIS
combat system-equipped ships will provide maritime task groups with
advanced air defence capabilities and will be equipped with a range
of defensive systems, including the ability to counter submarines. To
ensure that the destroyers keep pace with regional capabilities, we will:

`` regularly upgrade the AEGIS combat system

`` acquire advanced surface-to-air missiles

`` upgrade self-protection systems and unmanned tactical
intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance systems.


-----

Capability Stream: Maritime and anti-submarine warfare
## 85

4.22 Enhancements will also be undertaken to the communications and

combat system to support interoperability with other platforms and
systems such as the E-7A Wedgetail, P-8A Poseidon, F-35A Lightning II
and the future frigate.

4.23 Australia’s existing fleet of eight Anzac Class frigates will be replaced

from the late 2020s by a new fleet of nine frigates, which will be more
capable than the Anzac Class. Following a competitive evaluation
process, a continuous build of Australia’s future frigates will begin in
South Australia in 2020. The future frigates will be required to conduct
a range of missions, with a particular focus on anti-submarine warfare.
They will have sufficient range and endurance to operate effectively
throughout maritime South East Asia. They will be able to be deployed
from forward bases, such as in the Middle East, and will be equipped
with a range of offensive and self-protection systems.

4.24 The Hobart Class ships and future frigates will operate embarked

helicopters and tactical unmanned systems as integral components
of their combat systems. The ships will have sufficient endurance
for short-term regional operations; however, their effectiveness will
be multiplied when supported by replenishment ships, intelligence,
surveillance, and reconnaissance systems, and when operating in
unison with maritime surveillance and response aircraft.

4.25 Australia’s destroyers and frigates will operate in task groups and

also in smaller task units or elements in coalition or independent ADF
operations, commensurate with the scale and intensity of the missions
at hand.

4.26 Since the Anzacs will remain as a key component of our surface fleet

beyond the decade to FY 2025–26, it is essential to continue the
upgrades of the fleet’s sensors with the CEAFAR radar, as well as
ensuring that the combat and weapons systems remain interoperable
with other ADF and coalition assets. Defence has programmed upgrades
to the destroyers’ and Anzac Class frigates’ combat systems, weapons,


-----

POTENT AND AGILE OFFENSIVE RESPONSE
## 86

sensors and countermeasures to mitigate obsolescence caused by
emerging air and surface threats and maintain systems supportability.

4.27 Infrastructure works at HMAS Stirling and Garden Island will

accommodate the necessary upgrades for the future frigate. HMAS
Coonawarra, in the Northern Territory, will also be upgraded to support
the existing maritime force. In the longer-term, potentially in the
mid to late 2030s, options to establish naval facilities with greater
capacity in the Northern Territory may be required. This will be the
subject of further analysis.

**_Maritime surveillance and response aircraft_**

4.28 The existing AP-3C Orion aircraft are being replaced by the P-8A Poseidon

aircraft to support maritime surveillance and response together with
the MQ-4C Triton unmanned aircraft (discussed in the intelligence,
_surveillance, reconnaissance, electronic warfare, space and cyber stream)._

4.29 While the primary role of the maritime surveillance and response

aircraft is intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance in support of
maritime operations, it can also undertake offensive operations against
submarines and ships, and support search and rescue operations.

4.30 We will regularly upgrade the Poseidon to ensure that it remains

common with the United States Navy’s fleet, to maintain its capability
against prevailing threats and to minimise support and development
costs. Future planned upgrades to be considered include enhancements
to the radar, targeting, communications and weapons. The aircraft will be
upgraded incrementally throughout its life, including necessary sensor,
combat management, weapons, stores and countermeasures systems,
to mitigate obsolescence caused by emerging submarine, surface and
air threats and to maintain systems supportability.

4.31 Eight Poseidon aircraft will be introduced in the early 2020s, with seven

additional aircraft to be acquired in two tranches to bring the total to
fifteen aircraft by the late 2020s. Airfield upgrades are planned to support
Poseidon operations, including the Cocos (Keeling) Islands airfield.


-----

Capability Stream: Maritime and anti-submarine warfare
## 87

**_Maritime tactical unmanned aircraft_**

4.32 To improve the situational awareness of ships on operations, we

will acquire a new tactical unmanned intelligence, surveillance, and
reconnaissance aircraft system that will complement other sensors and
systems by extending the area able to be held under surveillance.
These systems will be progressively introduced over the decade to
FY 2025‑26. They will be able to operate from a range of vessels of
varying size, including the future frigates and patrol vessels.

**_Maritime combat helicopters_**

4.33 The 24 MH-60R Seahawk helicopters are currently being accepted

into service. These advanced helicopters will enhance the conduct
of anti‑ship and anti-submarine warfare operations undertaken by
destroyers and frigates. The Integrated Investment Program includes
provision for the Seahawk’s combat system, sensors, weapons and
countermeasures to be upgraded throughout their operational life to
maintain commonality and supportability with the United States’ Navy.

**_Deployable anti-ship missiles_**

4.34 Defence will acquire a new deployable land-based anti-ship missile

system from the mid-2020s. This new capability to engage ships from
land will enhance sea control and force protection for ADF deployments.
It could also contribute to protecting vital offshore assets such as oil and
natural gas platforms.

**_Offshore patrol vessels_**

4.35 Twelve offshore patrol vessels will replace the 13 existing Armidale

Class patrol boats. Following a competitive evaluation process,
construction will commence in Australia in 2018 as the first element of
the continuous shipbuilding program, with all 12 offshore patrol vessels
to be delivered by 2030.

4.36 The patrol vessels will enhance the ADF’s capacity to support border

security, maritime resource protection and military patrol and response

operations. These larger patrol vessels will be primarily focused on
border security and resource protection. They will also be capable of
more extended operations, with enhanced range and endurance to
improve support to operations further afield, particularly across maritime
South East Asia and the South Pacific.

4.37 The acquisition of a class of patrol vessels with greater capacity than

the Armidale Class should enable the destroyer and frigate force to
concentrate on higher tempo, higher risk tasks beyond Australia’s coastal
areas. These larger patrol vessels of around 70–80 metres in length will
be able to embark unmanned aerial, underwater and surface vehicles and
operate larger sea boats than the existing Armidale Class.

**_Mine countermeasures systems_**

4.38 Defence will extend the life of four Huon Class Coastal Mine Hunters

until the 2030s, through a Service Life Extension and Capability
Assurance Program to be conducted between 2018 and 2025.

4.39 Extending the life of four of the existing Huon Class fleet will provide

time to develop and evaluate remotely operated mine countermeasures
and bathymetric collection systems to inform capability development.
This could include the potential future option of a modular, mine
countermeasures system that could be deployed from a range of
non‑specialist vessels, subject to developments in technology.

**_Hydrographic survey and maritime geospatial systems_**

4.40 The current fleet of two large and four smaller ADF hydrographic survey

vessels will be progressively retired from around the early 2020s.
Defence will replace this capability with an efficient combination of
military and commercial hydrographic and oceanographic survey
capabilities to deliver the required capacity. Subject to developments
in technology, modular systems could in the future enable enhanced
hydrographic capabilities from non-specialist vessels suitable for tasks
including rapid environmental assessment in support of operations.

Capability Stream: Maritime and anti-submarine warfare
## 89

4.41 Subject to suitable commercial arrangements, the Laser Airborne

Depth Sounder (currently hosted in a commercially contracted
aircraft) could be replaced from around 2019. It could be replaced
with a commensurate high volume space and/or air-based bathymetry
collection system, and contracted ship-based, and remotely operated,
underwater vehicle-based sensors.

### Capability Stream: Strike and air combat

5.1 Over the decade to FY 2025–26, Defence will invest around 17 per cent
of the Integrated Investment Program to enhance Australia’s strike and
air combat capabilities.

5.2 A potent strike and air combat capability will enable effective airspace
control (in the defence of Australia and its territories or when ADF
elements are deployed on operations) and precision strike at long
ranges. A robust set of current and planned platforms and systems
provide the basis upon which to build the future capability, which could
encompass theatre level integrated air and missile defence in support
of deployed forces. Substantial investments are proposed to strengthen
our platforms, command, control, communications, computing and
intelligence (C4I) systems, sensors and advanced weapons.

5.3 Australia’s existing and already approved capabilities that contribute to
the strike and air combat function are:

`` fighter and strike aircraft (24 F/A-18F Super Hornets and 72 F-35A
Lightning II Joint Strike Fighters) and our current fleet of
71 F/A‑18A/B 'classic' Hornets which is being progressively retired

`` electronic attack aircraft (12 E/A-18G Growlers)

`` early warning and control aircraft (6 E-7A Wedgetails)

`` air-defence systems.

5.4 The capabilities will be enhanced through:

`` new air-to-surface, air-to-air and high-speed and long-range strike
and anti-ship weapons


-----

Capability Stream: Strike and air combat
## 95

`` upgrades for the Growler aircraft

`` future replacement of the Super Hornets

`` better integration of air and space surveillance systems, including
upgrades to command and control capabilities

`` enhanced fixed and deployable air search radars

`` deployable ground-based air-defence systems

`` light helicopters that are rapidly deployable by transport aircraft.

5.5 The Government will increase investment to improve communications,
sensors and targeting system integration between various platforms,
including the Joint Strike Fighters, Wedgetail, Hobart Class Air Warfare
Destroyers, Growlers and land-based systems – so that their capabilities
can be combined more effectively during joint operations, generating
greater potency and lethality. Realising the full potential of the Joint Strike
Fighter and Growler aircraft is dependent on investments outlined in the
Intelligence, surveillance, reconnaissance, electronic warfare, space
and cyber stream. These investments will facilitate enhancements in
processing, analysing and disseminating intelligence and mission data.

**_Strike and air combat workforce summary_**

5.6 The strike and air combat workforce will increase by around 500 ADF
positions to support:

`` advanced C4I to underpin more robust integration of air and
missile defence systems

`` deployable light helicopters

`` deployable ground-launched air-defence capabilities.

**_Strike and air combat infrastructure summary_**

5.7 Significant investment is planned this decade to FY 2025–26 in new
infrastructure and facilities that support the ADF’s strike and air combat
capabilities. Key proposals include upgrading facilities at:

`` RAAF Tindal, Northern Territory

`` RAAF Williamtown, New South Wales


-----

POTENT AND AGILE OFFENSIVE RESPONSE
## 96

`` RAAF Scherger, Queensland

`` RAAF Bases Learmonth and Curtin, Western Australia.

5.8 Most of these proposals are representative of broader works to
strengthen ADF presence and provide operational supportability in and
from the north of Australia, and to accommodate the heavier and more
sophisticated aircraft that will operate from these locations.

**_Fighter and strike aircraft_**

5.9 The Super Hornet and the Joint Strike Fighter will conduct both strike
and air-defence roles. The 72 Joint Strike Fighters will begin to enter
operational service to replace Australia’s 'classic' Hornets from 2020
and are expected to be the pre-eminent regional air combat capability
for at least 20 years following their introduction into service. The
Joint Strike Fighter will have advanced fifth-generation systems and
situational awareness. They will be able to employ a mix of air-to-air and
air-to-surface weapons with precision, be able to operate at extended
ranges maintaining stealth, and provide a true multi-role capability.

5.10 The Joint Strike Fighter will be interoperable with other ADF elements

equipped with United States derived systems as well as United
States forces. The nature of the global partnership in developing and
supporting the Joint Strike Fighter also extends an interoperability
benefit more broadly with potential coalition partners, including within
our region. Regular updates to maintain a common and supportable
configuration with the United States’ Joint Strike Fighter fleet will reduce
the cost to Australia of upgrading the software and hardware to maintain
its leading edge capabilities.

5.11 The Super Hornet fleet has been extended beyond its initial bridging

capability timeframe and is now planned to be replaced by around
2030. Its replacement could include either a fourth operational squadron
of Joint Strike Fighters or possibly a yet to be developed unmanned
combat aerial vehicle. The decision on the replacement of this air
combat capability will be best undertaken post-2020 when technology


-----

Capability Stream: Strike and air combat
## 97

and emerging threat trends are better understood, and we have the
benefit of our initial Joint Strike Fighter operating experience.

5.12 A series of new weapons will be acquired for the strike and air combat

capability including air-to-surface and air-to-air munitions, with specific
consideration of high-speed and long-range strike and anti-ship weapons.

5.13 To support the continual transformation of the ADF’s strike and air

combat fleet and its enabling capabilities, an extensive program of
investment in infrastructure will be required across Australia. New and
enhanced weapons and explosive ordnance facilities at RAAF Amberley,
Williamtown, Townsville, Tindal and Defence Establishment Orchard Hills
will allow these new high technology weapon systems to be stored and
maintained safely and securely. A northern explosive ordnance storage
facility will also be established at or near RAAF Tindal for the bulk
storage of explosive ordnance. A new rail link from the main line will be
established to Tindal to allow for the transport of bulk fuel and ordnance.

5.14 The existing infrastructure at RAAF Williamtown and RAAF Amberley

will be upgraded. Dedicated infrastructure works to support the Joint
Strike Fighters will proceed at RAAF Bases Williamtown, Edinburgh,
Townsville, Tindal, Darwin, Curtin, Learmonth, Pearce and Scherger. Air
traffic control systems will be upgraded across the country in concert
with upgrades to civil aviation systems. Infrastructure and other systems
will also be built or acquired to support refuelling and fire control.

5.15 There will be a substantial focus on infrastructure-related investments

in northern Australia, in particular the Northern Territory. As Defence’s
plans mature, it will be essential that there is close and effective
engagement with key stakeholders, such as the Northern Territory
government. In the longer-term, post-2026, and subject to further
analysis of options, consideration will need to be given to developing
options to enhance air base capacity in the Northern Territory, to address
growing capacity, security and urban encroachment issues. A new
facility to support the ADF of the twenty-first century will better support
operations, training and exercises.


-----

POTENT AND AGILE OFFENSIVE RESPONSE
## 98

5.16 A new advanced joint training area and enhanced training target systems

will also be considered for northern Australia. This facility will support
joint exercises between the ADF and Australia’s allies and security
partners, particularly where advanced air support is required.

**_Airborne electronic attack aircraft_**

5.17 The 12 E/A-18G Growler electronic attack aircraft represent a new

capability that will enter service from 2018, and is likely to remain
in service for 20–30 years. These aircraft use a combination of
electronic systems and sophisticated weapons to disrupt, disable and/
or confuse adversaries’ systems such as radars and command, control,
communications, computers and intelligence systems. They typically
work with fighter and strike aircraft to produce a potent air combat
package, but are also particularly useful in supporting a range of other
missions. These aircraft will be kept common with the United States’
fleet through regular upgrades.

5.18 New weapons and other systems will be acquired to enable the ADF

to fully utilise this capability. The high level of commonality between
the Growler and Super Hornet fleets provides an opportunity for
common training.

5.19 New dedicated facilities will be built at RAAF Amberley to house and

support the Growler capability. This capability will also be supported by
facilities upgrades and base improvement works including RAAF Tindal,
the Woomera range complex and the Delamere Air Weapons Range.

**_Airborne early warning and control aircraft_**

5.20 The airborne early warning and control capability consists of six

in‑service Wedgetail aircraft. Its highly capable and long-range radar
and other sensors allow the Wedgetail to maintain a broad picture of
the battlespace, which is used to coordinate joint operations.

5.21 The Wedgetail will continue to be upgraded in order to maintain

its capability edge ahead of a major refresh or replacement in the


-----

Capability Stream: Strike and air combat
## 99

mid‑2030s. Software, hardware and communications elements will also
be upgraded to enhance interoperability with other ADF and coalition
assets. The Wedgetail will play a key role in the ADF’s integrated air and
missile defence capability, particularly for deployed operations.

5.22 This capability will be supported by planned upgrades to airfield and

support facilities at RAAF Tindal.

**_Integrated air and missile defence_**

5.23 The ADF’s existing air-defence systems will be upgraded, including

command, control, communications, computers and intelligence (C4I)
systems and sensors. Investment in C4I will provide the foundation
for an enhanced integrated air and missile defence system for the
ADF, ensuring key C4I systems are able to fuse and share air and
space surveillance information effectively to enhance the accuracy and
speed of ADF systems’ response to air and missile threats. The ADF’s
enhanced integrated air and missile defence C4I architecture will have
the flexibility for further enhancement to handle more complex threats
that may emerge in future.

5.24 Defence will also acquire ground-based active electronically scanned

array radars from around 2020 and expand Australia’s access to air and
space situational awareness information, including through space-based
systems (discussed in the Intelligence, surveillance, reconnaissance,
_electronic warfare, space and cyber stream)._

5.25 In enhancing the ADF’s integrated air and missile defence capability,

Defence will also develop a Joint Battle Management System to better
coordinate and synchronise ADF operations, including the tracking and
engagement of forces within an area of operations. This system will be
deployable, in addition to supporting Australian-based capabilities. It
will improve situational awareness, such as the ability to generate and
disseminate a common operating picture, and enhance coordination of
air battle management, joint weapons employment (including maritime
and land strike) and ground-based air defence in operational theatres.


-----

POTENT AND AGILE OFFENSIVE RESPONSE
## 100

5.26 As part of the enhanced integrated air and missile defence system, the

Regional Operations Centres at RAAF Williamtown and Tindal, and the
Vigilaire air surveillance system, will be upgraded or replaced to enable
integration with a broad range of systems and sensors. In addition,
ADF capabilities will also be upgraded, where necessary, with modern
Identification Friend or Foe systems to allow unambiguous identification
and reduce the chance of fratricide in joint and coalition operations.

5.27 The ADF’s current ground-based air-defence capability consists of

the short-range RBS-70 air-defence system, which has limited utility
against modern threats. The future ground-based air-defence system
will replace the RBS-70 with a short-range man-portable surface‑to‑air
system by the early 2020s, and will later be supplemented by a
medium-range surface-to-air missile system in the mid to late 2020s,
providing a layered air-defence against a broad range of capable air
threats. These systems will be matched with command and control and
fire control systems with high levels of integration to act as the inner
layers of the upgraded integrated air and missile defence system.

5.28 In the near term, an advanced tactical ‘sense, warn, locate and effect’

system with improved sense and warn capabilities compared to the
current Counter-Rocket, Artillery and Mortar system for rocket, artillery,
mortars and bombs, will also be acquired. This system would be
enhanced in the future with a gun system capable of engaging a range of
threats as the last line of defence against rocket and missile attacks; this
will provide improved force protection for static ground elements, and
act as the inner-most layer of the enhanced integrated air and missile
defence system.

**_Deployable light helicopters_**

5.29 In addition to the CH-47F Chinook and MRH-90 Troop lift helicopters

(which are used primarily for air lift), a new fleet of light reconnaissance
and attack helicopters will be acquired from around 2025 to provide


-----

Capability Stream: Strike and air combat
## 101

air mobility support optimised for special operations missions. The
new helicopters will likely feature some light armament and modern
intelligence, surveillance, reconnaissance and communications
capabilities for integration with the joint force. They will be able to be
deployed rapidly as a small force element of three to four aircraft and
personnel by the Globemaster. Current plans also include a requirement
for role-specific upgrades to the MRH-90 Troop lift helicopter to
replace the S-70A Blackhawk in support of domestic counter-terrorism
operations.

### Capability Stream: Land combat and amphibious warfare

6.1 Over the decade to FY 2025–26, Defence will invest around 18 per cent
of the Integrated Investment Program in Australia’s land combat and
amphibious warfare capabilities.

6.2 The land force has seen major investment in core capabilities over
more than a decade of high tempo operations. Enhancements will
be made across a range of capabilities including compatible digital
communications and information systems to enable the land force to
integrate with other parts of the ADF and coalition forces. The Canberra
Class amphibious ships will significantly enhance the ADF’s ability to
undertake a broad range of operations throughout our near region.

6.3 Land capability is fundamentally organised around combat and enabling
brigades that are combined to achieve desired effects.

6.4 The combat elements of Infantry, Armour, Artillery, Engineers, Aviation
and Special Forces all contribute to the land combat and amphibious
warfare function. These forces are supported by intelligence,
surveillance, reconnaissance and electronic warfare capabilities,
deployable battlefield logistics and the Canberra Class amphibious
ships and associated amphibious support capabilities.

6.5 Existing capabilities and approved acquisitions include:

`` advanced personal equipment for soldiers

`` protected mobility (such as Bushmasters and the Hawkei)


-----

Capability Stream: Land combat and amphibious warfare
## 107

`` enhanced force protection (such as capabilities to
counter improvised explosive devices)

`` new artillery

`` enhanced digital communications.

6.6 New investments will enhance land combat and amphibious warfare
capabilities through improved situational awareness, firepower,
protection, mobility and force sustainability. These investments will
include:

`` a program for continuously improving soldiers’ personal
equipment and force protection

`` expanding digital communications and networks with enhanced
joint integration

`` acquiring a new generation of armoured vehicles

`` upgrading the existing M1 Abrams Main Battle Tank fleet

`` enhancing battlefield intelligence, surveillance and
reconnaissance capabilities through a new armed,
medium-altitude long-endurance unmanned aircraft and a
suite of tactical unmanned systems

`` replacing the Tiger helicopter fleet with a future armed aerial
reconnaissance capability from the mid-2020s

`` acquiring combat and amphibious support systems including
over-the-beach logistics and beached materiel recovery

`` acquiring additional small boats and other specialist capabilities
such as breaching, bridging and recovery equipment

`` acquiring a new long-range rocket system in the mid-2020s.

**_Land combat and amphibious warfare workforce summary_**

6.7 A range of enhancements will be made in the land combat and
amphibious warfare function. Around an additional 700 ADF positions


-----

POTENT AND AGILE OFFENSIVE RESPONSE
## 108

will be required to support enhancements to:

`` force generation for amphibious operations from the Canberra
Class amphibious ships

`` amphibious support systems, including over the beach logistics
and beached materiel recovery

`` armed medium-altitude, long-endurance unmanned aircraft

`` tactical unmanned aircraft

`` a long-range rocket capability

`` combat support systems.

**_Land combat and amphibious warfare infrastructure summary_**

6.8 New investment this decade to FY 2025–26 is planned for infrastructure
and facilities that support the ADF’s land combat and amphibious
warfare capabilities. Substantial funding is programmed for upgrading
or extending soldiers’ accommodation and facilities that will be required
to support new and upgraded land combat and amphibious warfare
capital equipment, such as new armoured vehicles, a new long-range
rocket capability and a new armed, medium-altitude long-endurance
unmanned aircraft.

6.9 A number of ADF training areas, along with a range of ADF
establishments, will be upgraded. These include:

`` Shoalwater Bay, Queensland – the major ADF joint amphibious
training area

`` Bradshaw Field Training Area, Northern Territory

`` Cultana, South Australia

`` Yampi Sound, Western Australia

`` Puckapunyal Military Area, Victoria


-----

Capability Stream: Land combat and amphibious warfare
## 109

`` Holsworthy Barracks, New South Wales

`` Campbell Barracks, Western Australia

`` Lavarack Barracks, Queensland

`` Robertson and Larrakeyah Barracks, Northern Territory.

6.10 Key enhancements will include the construction of advanced training

target systems and connection to the enterprise simulation system.
Together these enhancements will improve the realism and effectiveness
of integrated, joint force training.

**_Infantry – soldier systems_**

6.11 The soldier system refers to items worn by individual soldiers and the

equipment they carry to prevail in combat. The ability to rapidly acquire,
upgrade or adapt critical soldier system capabilities is important to
ensure that soilders can operate in different environments and address
new threats or tactical requirements. As we have seen over the last
decade, evolving operational requirements can often be met quickly
through rapid acquisition programs. Defence will continuously monitor,
adapt and improve the ensemble of soldier system and force protection
equipment in response to evolving operational requirements, taking into
account new technologies and emerging threats such as developments
in body armour or improvised explosive devices. This will ensure our
ADF personnel are appropriately equipped for the particular mission and
operational environment at hand, including as we further develop the
ADF’s amphibious capability.

6.12 The key weapons systems to be acquired include:

`` small arms – such as rifles and pistols

`` direct fire support weapons including those used against armoured
vehicles, bunkers and installations

`` indirect weapons – such as mortars.

POTENT AND AGILE OFFENSIVE RESPONSE
## 110

6.13 New improved personal protection equipment will also be acquired.

Investment funding will support the agile procurement of personnel
equipment including:

`` a flexible suite of combat uniforms to suit camouflage and climatic
conditions

`` body armour

`` helmets

`` night-fighting equipment

`` load carriage systems

`` personal protective equipment to mitigate chemical, biological
and radiological threats.

6.14 A range of command, control and situational awareness systems will be

acquired to ensure information access is available to individual soldiers
and commanders to support decision-making. These systems will
provide location reporting and secure voice communications.

**_Armoured vehicles_**

6.15 There are four elements to the armoured vehicle capability:

`` armour – based on the Abrams

`` cavalry – based on the current ASLAV and the future replacement
Combat Reconnaissance Vehicle

`` armoured mobility – based on the current M113AS4 Armoured
Personnel Carrier and a future replacement Infantry Fighting
Vehicle

`` armoured Combat Support and Combat Service Support
(specialist versions of the above mentioned platforms).

6.16 The current Abrams fleet will be upgraded to extend its life to at least

2035. Upgrades will maintain the tanks’ effectiveness and lethality
against evolving threats as well as enhancing their interoperability with


-----

Capability Stream: Land combat and amphibious warfare
## 111

other ADF platforms and systems. The ASLAV fleet will be replaced with
new Combat Reconnaissance Vehicles from around 2019 to provide an
enhanced persistent close reconnaissance capability. The Armoured
Personnel Carrier fleet will be replaced with new Infantry Fighting
Vehicles from around 2024. These vehicles will be equipped with
superior firepower, networking and protection and will be deployable
rapidly by air in small numbers and in larger numbers by Canberra
Class amphibious ships and logistics support vessels.

6.17 Upgraded or additional facilities will be required at existing bases

(including in Brisbane, Darwin, Puckapunyal and Townsville) and at
selected weapon ranges and training areas (including Puckapunyal and
Shoalwater Bay).

**_Canberra class amphibious ships_**

6.18 The two Canberra Class amphibious ships will provide the ADF with an

unprecedented capability to conduct a wide range of operations (both
war and non war-like) in the maritime environment. These two ships
will enable the ADF to land a sizeable force of personnel and equipment
across a broad spectrum of operations. In non-combat operations, the
amphibious ships’ on-board hospital and their ability to operate without
wharves or port infrastructure will be a major asset in support of both
domestic and international disaster recovery missions.

6.19 Over time the capability of the ships will be enhanced to better support

joint command and control, including upgrades to communications and
intelligence systems and semi-autonomous self-defence capabilities.
This will include communications systems that are compatible with all
amphibious force elements – watercraft, helicopters and amphibious
vehicles – allowing enhanced command and control and situational
awareness. The ships will also be fitted with systems that allow them
to collect, analyse and distribute intelligence. In the longer-term, the
existing landing craft used to transport people and equipment from the
_Canberra Class ships to the shore will be replaced with new vessels._


-----

POTENT AND AGILE OFFENSIVE RESPONSE
## 112

6.20 Infrastructure works at HMAS Stirling and Garden Island will be

undertaken to support the Canberra Class amphibious ships.

**_Special operations forces_**

6.21 The special operations capability provides rapidly deployable

options to respond to high-risk threats in unpredictable and uncertain
environments. Special operations can be broadly grouped into the
categories of special reconnaissance, special recovery and direct action.

6.22 The Integrated Investment Program will enhance Australia’s special

operations capabilities, including through: acquiring high-end close
combat capabilities; improved mission command networks and
situational awareness tools; enhanced tactical mobility; specialised
force protection; and logistic support capabilities. Specialist
transportation systems will also be acquired, upgraded or factored into
other planned capability acquisitions, including land vehicles,
role-specific upgrades to existing helicopters and the new light
deployable helicopter from the mid-2020s, watercraft and parachuting
capability. Special operations forces will also benefit from the enduring
program of soldier system continuous development outlined above,
supported by the continuous development and procurement of
equipment where there is a more specialised requirement.

**_Artillery_**

6.23 Artillery provides a persistent fire support capability in support of ADF

or coalition land operations. The current artillery capability consists of
54 medium artillery howitzers (155mm M-777 towed artillery), with
supporting equipment and personnel. The M-777 capability can engage
targets out to 30km with persistent and responsive fires in all weather.

6.24 A long-range rocket system will be acquired in the mid-2020s to

complement the ADF’s existing artillery capability, providing an option
for long-range fire support (up to around 300km) to joint operations.
Enhanced C4I and high levels of airspace and target coordination will
support the introduction of this substantial new capability for the ADF.


-----

Capability Stream: Land combat and amphibious warfare
## 113

6.25 Some additional facilities may be required to support the long-range

rocket capability. These will include gun bays, workshops and simulators
at a yet to be chosen garrison location as well as compatible training
areas and target systems.

**_General purpose and protected vehicles_**

6.26 The ADF’s ground transport capabilities provide protected and

unprotected mobility for a range of joint combat and support systems.
The general purpose ‘B’ vehicle fleet comprises light, medium and
heavy vehicles and trailers. A program to replace these vehicles is
expected to be completed by the mid-2020s – this program will
include the introduction of protected variants to the fleet to enhance
force protection.

6.27 Australia’s Protected Mobility Vehicles provide superior protection

for our forces against blast and fragmentation. Our Protected Mobility
fleet comprises the Australian designed and produced Bushmaster
and Hawkei vehicle fleets. The Bushmaster fleet (approximately 700
vehicles) will be replaced after reaching its life of type from around
2025. The new Hawkei light Protected Mobility Vehicles will be
introduced from the early 2020s. Defence will ensure the compatibility
of the Protected Mobility fleet and general purpose ‘B’ vehicles with the
ADF’s amphibious ships, organic watercraft and transport aircraft for
off-shore deployment.

**_Combat, construction and support engineers_**

6.28 Engineering support for land force operations consists of combat,

construction and support engineers. These elements provide support to
all land forces through five core functions:

`` assault breaching of obstacles, bridging and route construction

`` counter-mobility – construction of obstacles and demolition of
bridges and routes

`` survivability – physical hardening and fortification of installations


-----

POTENT AND AGILE OFFENSIVE RESPONSE
## 114

`` sustainability – provision of water, sanitation and electricity to
deployed forces

`` geospatial support – reconnaissance and analysis of terrain.

6.29 Key capabilities to be acquired over the decade to FY 2025–26,

which will include consideration of cost effective commercial
leasing arrangements where appropriate, include protected and
unprotected engineering work platforms such as cranes, excavators,
front‑end‑loaders, forklifts, tractors, concrete production plants and rock
crushers. Armoured breaching and bridging platforms, aviation and fire
trucks and other support capabilities will also be acquired.

**_Armed reconnaissance helicopter_**

6.30 The 22 Tiger helicopters provide a responsive reconnaissance and

attack platform to support joint operations. In a reconnaissance role
this helicopter complements other surveillance and reconnaissance
capabilities. The Tiger’s intelligence, surveillance, reconnaissance and
electronic warfare capabilities and attack options (including a range
of precision weapons) can be employed and tailored to support tasks
including close air support, escort and interdiction.

6.31 Armed reconnaissance helicopter operations will rely increasingly on

intelligence and mission data and access to the common operating
picture and other real time data for effective integration with joint forces.

6.32 The Tiger has had a troubled history – essential upgrades are

programmed to maintain the capability’s effectiveness. Defence will
invest in a future armed reconnaissance capability to replace the Tiger,
which could include manned or unmanned systems or a combination of
both, to be introduced from the mid-2020s.

**_Armed intelligence, surveillance, reconnaissance unmanned aircraft_**

6.33 The ADF does not currently operate armed unmanned aircraft systems.

Defence developed an operational unmanned aircraft capability in the
Afghanistan conflict to provide persistent observation of the battlefield


-----

Capability Stream: Land combat and amphibious warfare
## 115

through a number of sensor types. Provision to grow the ADF’s existing
capability through acquisition of an advanced armed, medium-altitude,
long-endurance unmanned aircraft for an integrated and persistent
intelligence, surveillance, reconnaissance and attack capability to
support ADF and coalition forces is programmed for the early 2020s.

6.34 A fully integrated armed, medium-altitude unmanned aircraft capability

supported by intelligence analysts will facilitate the timely delivery of
accurate information to commanders at all levels, providing superior
situational awareness to inform decision-making. This system’s
intelligence, surveillance and reconnaissance capability will also
enhance the ADF’s counter-terrorism support capability overseas and
could augment search and rescue, humanitarian assistance and disaster
relief and coastal surveillance tasks.

6.35 The new armed, medium-altitude, long-endurance unmanned

aircraft will require some enhancements to our command and control
capabilities, along with facilities, including a ground control station and
fixed and deployable launch and recovery elements. Some additional
fixed facilities, including at RAAF Townsville, will be required to
suppport this new capability.

**_Land tactical intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance_**

6.36 The land tactical intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance

capability contributes to the protection of the force and directly
supports the quality and timeliness of decision-making by improving
a land commander’s situational awareness. Land tactical intelligence,
surveillance, and reconnaissance can be provided from many sources
ranging from a soldier’s observation to the systems on-board platforms
on helicopters and vehicles. The key to the effective development of
this capability is to ensure that information gathered is accessible and
fused with other sources of data to build a common, integrated picture
of the operating environment; in time, this integrated picture needs to be
disseminated in a timely manner and be accessible as required across
different force elements.


-----

POTENT AND AGILE OFFENSIVE RESPONSE
## 116

6.37 The systems that contribute to land tactical intelligence, surveillance,

and reconnaissance in this context are ground-based sensors, small
unmanned aircraft and joint integration to enable access to situational
awareness. Ground-based sensing systems include laser range
finders, weapons sights, thermal imaging and ground surveillance
radar and some specialised surveillance systems employed with
combat reconnaissance platforms. In addition to the in-service Shadow
unmanned aircraft, new capabilities such as smaller hand-launched
systems will be introduced to complement ground-based sensing and
provide tactical commanders with organic, responsive systems.

6.38 Some additional facilities or enhancements may be required across

existing bases to support new capabilities, including armouries and
upgrades to weapon ranges and simulators.

**_Land intelligence and electronic warfare_**

6.39 The land intelligence and electronic warfare capability directly supports

land warfare and force protection through managing the collection,
processing and analysis of information and the dissemination of
intelligence to improve the quality and timeliness of a commander’s
decisions. This capability will be enhanced by new information
management systems and networks that are able to support joint
integration and strategic reach-back.

**_Deployable land networks_**

6.40 Deployable land networks enable the land force to communicate across

the battlespace including within and between formations on the ground,
with aircraft and ships, with headquarters and other agencies or partners.
The capability includes deployed and mobile network components.
Deployed elements are moved into the area of operations where they are
largely static until deployed elsewhere, while mobile elements are able
to continue operating while moving around the battlespace.

6.41 Existing deployable systems include satellite systems, terrestrial

communications systems (such as high frequency radio networks), and
a deployed local area network which includes the ability to conduct


-----

Capability Stream: Land combat and amphibious warfare
## 117

information processing. The existing mobile network is typically built
around portable devices operating independently of fixed infrastructure.
Mobile devices range in size from computers and radios fitted in
vehicles to mobile tactical radios carried by individual soldiers.

6.42 Technology moves at a rapid pace in the field of modern

communications; the next generation of equipment is often available
at 12-18 months intervals. The short obsolescence cycle of
communications equipment presents both challenges and opportunities.
It is essential that Defence has the agility to take advantage of rapidly
advancing technology. This will require regular flexible investment
approaches and effective industry partnerships as Defence pursues more
agile strategies to keep pace with advancing needs and technology.
A further challenge will be to ensure that, where practicable and
effective, we maintain compatibility between the land, air and maritime
components and ensure cost-effective maintenance programs. This will
be achieved through establishing a program to progressively and regularly
upgrade or replace the deployable land networks from around 2020.

6.43 Future challenges in developing the ADF’s amphibious capability and

integrating communications systems more broadly across the force will
need to be addressed, including through building on the existing Land
Network Integration Centre. This will provide an enhanced battle lab
testing facility that will help to ensure systems interoperability across
the joint force and explore more sensitive joint capability solutions for
further development.

**_Battlefield logistics support_**

6.44 The battlefield logistic support capability directly supports deployed

forces and land operations through the supply, transport and
maintenance of goods. Battlefield logistic support is a complex and
critical function – it relies on and interacts with other logistics systems
including national supply chains, commercial fuel arrangements and,
potentially, coalition systems. A priority for investment is in enhancing
our logistics over-the-shore capabilities, including for the transfer of


-----

POTENT AND AGILE OFFENSIVE RESPONSE
## 118

bulk fuels, water and stores, to support the evolving ADF deployable
amphibious capability employing the Canberra Class ships.

6.45 The acquisition and upgrade of logistics systems, along with the

reform of logistics business functions and processes, are central to
the modernisation program to deliver an integrated Defence logistics
system. Effective deployable systems, for instance on the Canberra
Class amphibious ships, that can integrate with the national logistics
systems to enable more efficient and timely logistics support will be a
priority. These initiatives in logistics will ensure that the joint force is
supported across the full spectrum of missions.

6.46 The battlefield logistic support capability includes the following

functions:

`` supply and distribution – the introduction into theatre and
movement of stores such as ammunition, rations and fuel

`` transport – vehicles such as trucks, water transport, and handling
equipment like forklifts

`` maintenance and recovery – maintenance of equipment and
recovery of damaged equipment

`` field and support services – such as field power generation, water
production, fuel storage and sanitation.

6.47 Progressive investment across the battlefield logistic support capability

is required to maintain its effectiveness. This will include enhancements
to the deployable logistics information systems, replacement of the
current transport vessels (LCM8, LARC V), and replacement of the
deployable materiel handling equipment. Deployable infrastructure will
be upgraded, including field power generation and water purification
systems. Defence will also continue to invest in ancillary capabilities
including watercraft and amphibious deployment and sustainment
systems to keep the logistics capabilities of the Canberra Class
amphibious ships at the leading edge.

**_Riverine patrol_**

6.48 A Riverine Patrol capability will be re-established to increase tactical

mobility in the littoral zone. The Riverine Patrol capability will deliver
a fleet of lightly armed boats from around 2022 to allow operations
in a wide range of estuarine environments. The capability will provide
sufficient capacity to embark a force element that is capable of effective
combat and could be used to transport small mobility assets such as
all-terrain vehicles.
