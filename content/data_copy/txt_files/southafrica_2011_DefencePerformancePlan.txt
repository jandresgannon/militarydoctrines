#### Foreword by the Honourable Minister of Defence and Military Veterans, L.N. Sisulu, MP

###### In the 2010 budget Vote, we pro� led the conscious development of reliable, dependable human capital base within the Defence Force. To this end, we announced the establishment of the National Defence Service Force Commission, revitalisation of the Defence Reserves and  � nalisation of the non statutory Force Military Veterans Pension, to mention but a few. Auditable outputs have been recorded in so far as these are concerned and are evidenced by the Promulgation of Defence Amendment Act 22 of 2010, whose object is to provide for the establishment of the National Defence Force Service Commission charged with a role to create a separate dispensation for the Defence Force, creating a paradigm that prescribes contracts for Defence Reserves whilst protecting them from discrimination by employers and creditors.

 Stemming from the President’s announcement at a special Cabinet meeting on 25 October 2010, a new growth path for the country has been agreed upon. This path places people’s employment at the centre of government’s economic policy. Defence commits itself to support government’s intent in terms of inherent available Defence capabilities and initiatives such as the MSDS and National Youth Service system in contribution to national skills development and job creation.

 Notwithstanding the auditing standards that are continually being enhanced, the Ministry will earnestly pursue the realisation of a quali� cation free Audit. Some auditable strides have been registered which are a result of the multi-pronged strategy to realise the quali� cation free audit, of which operation “Clean Audit” is but one. Deepening in establishing internal controls that will help to proactively mitigate functions and processes that could lead to an audit quali� cation will be prioritised. A strong monitoring and evaluation capability will be enhanced.

 The role of Defence within the Government Cluster system in the International Co-operation Trade and Security (ICTS) Cluster, will continue to receive priority attention in order to strengthen South Africa’s support of international and regional peace, security and stability.

 The SANDF contributes with contingent force of 1229 men and women under the Mission dubbed MONUSCO in the DRC and 634 soldiers under the Mission code named UNAMID in Sudan. Apart from the troop contribution in the Peace Mission in the DRC, SANDF troops also provide post con� ict reconstruction in that country with the view to strengthening the weak state apparatus and institutions. In this respect the focus areas are integration and team building training, transformation process and general military training of the Armed Forces. On the basis of bilateral arrangements with Central African Republic, SANDF has deployed 49 men and women with the view to providing general military assistance in the form of training to the Armed Forces of said country.

 Internally, the SANDF has since April 2010 deployed for border safeguarding along the borders of RSA and her neighbouring countries. Currently, SANDF has already set its footprint along RSA/Zimbabwe Border and RSA/ Mozambique border and due to deploy along RSA/Lesotho border on 1 April 2011. State resources need to be mobilised more aggressively to ensure the stable roll out of Operation CORONA (border-safeguarding). Currently, Defence is furthermore exploring possibilities to ensure security against piracy prevails in the SADC waters on a bilateral and multinational basis. The piracy threat is real and therefore they is a need to ensure in accordance with safe guarding territorial integrity that we need to develop a plan on how to deal with this problem and ensure that our trade lines remain safe and secure.

 At the time of writing, the SANDF has joined forces with National Disaster Management Centre for humanitarian assistance community affected by � oods national. To this end, the SANDF has deployed air assets to airlift entrapped people to safety, as well as delivering food parcels for those in need. The mandate of the Defence remains that of Defence and protection of the, Republic, its territorial integrity and its people in accordance with the Constitution of the Republic and the principles on international law regulating the use of forces. 

 We have entered into a Delivery Agreement (DA) with the President to facilitate service delivery in terms of selected Medium Term Strategic Framework (MTSF) outcomes. In the meanwhile Defence has implemented the outcomes based strategic planning approach in order to ensure that high performance levels are


-----

###### and 5 and as such obligations that � ow from these delivery agreements must � nd expression in the planning instruments of the Constitutional institutions that service the Defence mandate, with the Defence Secretariat providing the essential norms and standards to guarantee implementation.

 The Strategic Plans are developed to give effect to the two constitutional entities that service the Defence Mandate which are the Defence Force and the Defence Secretariat re� ect, amongst others, the essence of the Delivery Agreement (DA) entered into, between myself and the Commander in Chief in terms of applicable Outcomes and provide parameters and expectations that I consider achievable for Defence. The alignment of Defence with the Constitutional and legislative mandate is re� ected through the pursuance of our identi� ed Outcomes, Outputs, Vision and Mission which will ensure that Defence remains relevant to the dynamic circumstances.

 Finally, allow me to re� ect a little on impact assessment of my Portfolio. During the Budget Vote 21 of both FY2009/10 and FY2010/11, I outlined the institutional reforms that will form the strategic levers of my transformation Agenda. In the FY 2009 Budget Vote, I indicated the need to provide a visible reward and recognition to all those that sacri� ced their well being to help us realise the freedoms that we now enjoy. As such Military Veterans were consciously my transformation agenda. To date the Department is indeed in place. The coming years will thus be characterised by initiatives to maximise the functionality of the organ of State by widening the footprint of a reliable and dependable service delivery focused Department.

 The execution of the Constitutional and legislative Defence mandate of both the Defence Secretariat and the South African National Defence Force are provided in the strategic and annual performance plans accompanying this Overarching Statement. These documents provide the required detailed information on the functioning of these two Defence entities.

 I am con� dent that through these planning instruments, distinctive features of the Defence Force will be protected whilst delivery to the citizens will be enhanced.

 (L.N. SISULU) MINISTER OF DEFENCE AND MILITARY VETERANS, MP

#### THE DEFENCE FUNCTION IN CONTEXT
###### DEFENCE CONSTITUTIONAL MANDATE

 The primary object of the Defence function is to provide for the Defence and protection of the Republic, its territorial integrity and its people. The Constitution provides that the rendition of the Defence function should be done in a manner consistent with the provisions of the Constitution and the principles of international law regulating the use of force.

 The Department of Defence (DOD) derives its mandate primarily from section 200(2) of the Constitution[1] as well as section 227 of the Interim Constitution of the Republic of South Africa[2]. The Defence mandate is given substance by the Defence Act[3], the White Paper on Defence (1996) and the Defence Review (1998).

 The DOD comprises of the Defence Secretariat which is established in terms of Section 204 of the Defence Act and the South African National Defence Force (SANDF) established in terms of Section 200 (2) of the Interim Constitution[4].

 VISION

 Effective Defence for a democratic South Africa.

 MISSION

 To provide, manage, prepare and employ Defence capabilities commensurate with the needs of South Africa as regulated by the Constitution, national legislation and Parliamentary and Executive direction. The above will be provided through the proper management, provision, preparedness and employment of Defence capabilities, which are in line with the domestic and global needs of South Africa.

 THE DOD MEDIUM-TERM STRATEGIC FOCUS

 In the medium to long term, the DOD will execute its mandate through focusing on the following:

 �� To defend and protect South Africa, its sovereignty, its territorial integrity, its national interests and its people in accordance with the Constitution and principles of international law regulating the use of force.

 �� To contribute to freedom from fear and want, including the promotion of human security, both nationally and internationally.

 �� To contribute to a better life for the people of South Africa.

 Whilst emphasising its obligation, the DOD embraces Government’s initiatives and priorities to alleviate poverty and underdevelopment. The DOD support to these Government initiatives requires that:

 �� Defence capabilities are enhanced and maintained.

 �� Peace, security and con� dence-building in the SADC region and the rest of the continent are promoted through constructive dialogue aimed at nurturing sound Defence diplomatic relations and projecting South Africa’s foreign policy principles and objectives;

 �� The Government’s policy to resolve con� icts peacefully through recognised international instruments and mechanisms be supported by deploying the SANDF in international peace missions;

 �� The Government’s diplomatic engagements are supported through participation in multilateral institutions such as the SADC, AU and UN.

2 Act 200 of 1993

###### THE MINISTER OF DEFENCE AND MILITARY VETERANS (MOD&MV) PRIORITIES

 For the period ahead, the Minister has made a determination of matters considered important for the DOD to pursue as strategic priorities. The execution of these strategic priorities will enhance the effective realisation of the Defence mandate. Monitoring and evaluation of performance against these identi� ed strategic priorities will test the extent to which the Defence function has been able to “do things differently and achieve more with less”. The strategic priorities identi� ed are as follows:

 �� Execution of the Border Safeguarding Function. The safeguarding of the borders of South Africa remains one of the key functions of the SANDF. The phased in approach, adopted by the SANDF in undertaking this function, will continue in FY2011/12 with the � nal phase completed in FY2012/13.

 �� Establishment of the New Service Dispensation. The Defence Amendment Act, 22 of 2011, has been enacted. As intended, the Defence Amendment Act has created a new service dispensation for the SANDF members. In FY2011/12 the DOD shall focus on the implementation of the afore-mentioned  amendment in order to realise this dispensation. Consequential amendments to other Acts will also be taken into account.

 �� Enhancement of the SANDF’s Landward Defence Capabilities. In order to undertake all required missions, the enhancement of the Landward Defence Capabilities is essential. For the Landward Defence Capability to operate jointly with the Air Defence and Maritime Defence Capabilities, this enhancement is considered a priority. The Landward Defence Capability has not enjoyed the advantage of being part of the Strategic Defence Packages and is thus lacking technologically advanced Primary Mission Equipment.

 �� Maritime Security. The Defence and security of South Africa is inextricably linked to that of the region and the continent. Being a littoral country, South Africa needs to have a balanced maritime capability to effectively respond to arising maritime security threats affecting South Africa. 

 �� Job Creation. In support of the government initiative on job creation, the DOD plans to create job opportunities in the following areas:

 �� Filling of all 1 401 vacant funded positions in the DOD. �� Recruitment of 5 700 young South Africans per year to the Military Skills Development System (MSDS). �� Call up of 16 400 Defence Reserve members per year to undertake speci� c tasks over speci� c periods of time. �� The enhancement of the DOD Works Capability to create opportunities for people with technical skills within the SANDF. This in turn will allow for the SANDF intakes to increase with the same number of the SANDF members transferred to the DOD Works Capability.  �� Creation of job opportunities in the Defence Industry through approved DOD projects.

 �� Enhancement of the SANDF’s Peacekeeping Capability (SANDF Deployability). The role of the SANDF in promoting peace and security in the region and the continent necessitates the enhancement of the SANDF’s peacekeeping capability that will include the SANDF’s Forward Deployment Capability.

 �� National Youth Service. The implementation of the National Youth Service by using core Defence capabilities to provide initial training to the youth prior to absorption into service delivery departments.

 �� Revitalisation of the Reserves. As part of the One Force concept, the Reserves must be transformed and revitalised to ful� l the various important Defence roles allocated to them.

 �� Restructuring and Support of the Defence Industry. The restructuring should focus on Defence capability, the interactive framework and function alignment in order to properly synchronise these with the requirements and mandate of Defence. The emphasis should be on Governance, Risk Management, Compliance and Accountability framework applicable within Defence Portfolio.

 �� Department of Defence Works Capability. The state of the DOD facilities portfolio calls for the review of the existing arrangements for the repair and maintenance of Defence facilities. The establishment of the DOD Works Capability seeks to achieve an end state where the DOD will have an in-house capacity that will ultimately assume the full responsibility of the Defence facilities repair and maintenance. The DOD Works Capability will at the same time create job opportunities in the DOD, thus contributing to the Government’s priority of job creation.

 DEFENCE OUTCOMES
 The Defence outcomes relate to the medium term results that are the consequence of achieving speci�c


-----

###### �� Enhanced Civil Control of the Department of Defence.

 �� RSA is Defended and Protected. DEFENCE OUTPUTS

###### INFORMATION SYSTEMS SUPPORTING DOD PERFORMANCE INFORMATION

 Since 2005, the DOD has developed an information system called “GEJIMA” which provides for one-stop-shop capturing of performance information. The aforementioned system is managed by the State Information, Technology Agency (SITA), and is utilised to conduct gap and trend analysis with regards to performance information. Notwithstanding the challenges with the current local area networks experienced in certain domains within the DOD, the Department is determined to improve on the integrity, currency and reliability of the performance information. In cases of infrastructural failures, capturing of data on the system as it relates to planning and performance data is undertaken at the SITA of� ces and the consolidated information is con� rmed by Departmental planning authorities.

###### FINANCIAL CONSIDERATIONS IN ALLOCATION OF THE DEFENCE PROGRAMMES

 The composition of the Defence’s Budget Programmes as published in the Estimates of National Expenditure (ENE) 2011, Vote 22 is as provided the Table below.

5 Data as reported for the � rst two quarters of the FY2010/11.
6 The indicator has been changed from 2011/12 to only re� ect “large-scale” operations, as the requirement for general military assistance and smallscale operations cannot be accurately projected. Currently the requirement is for two large-scale (Battalion + [More than 800 members]) operations,
but contingency planning is being done to be prepared for a third operation of limited duration, should it be required.
7 The large number in 2010 was due to operations in support of the 2010 FIFA World Cup and the gradual increase from 2011/12 onwards is the result of

###### DOD EXPENDITURE TRENDS The detail of DOD’s estimated expenditure is re� ected in Government’s Estimate of National Expenditure 2011 and is included in the Appropriation Bill 2011 tabled in Parliament on 23 February 2011.

 DEPARTMENTAL RECEIPTS

 Departmental receipts are mainly from the sale of redundant or obsolete equipment and Defence matériel, the rental of accommodation to personnel, and board and lodging. The reason for the � uctuations in real departmental receipts, speci� cally � nancial transactions in assets and liabilities, is due to the unpredictable nature of reimbursements for peace support operations. Revenue collection projections are also hampered by the unpredictable nature of the potential buyers of SANDF equipment, and by international treaties, protocols and licence agreements. Between FY2009/10 and FY2013/14, revenue is expected to increase from R676.7 million to R885.9 million, at an average annual rate of 7.7 percent.

## DEFENCE SECRETARIAT

 ANNUAL PERFORMANCE PLAN (APP)

##### FOR THE FISCAL YEARS

 2011/12 -2013/14

###### “Doing things differently to achieve more with less”

 Date of tabling: 09 March 2011


-----

## INTRODUCTION BY THE ACCOUNTING OFFICER

###### The mandate of Defence remains unambiguously the protection of the territorial integrity of the RSA. In delivering on this mandate, the collateral utility of Defence capabilities has been demonstrated with the various service delivery projects in support of other government departments.  The mandate is executed in terms of section 200(1) that establishes a disciplined South African National Defence Force (SANDF) whose functions are articulated in section 224(1) of the interim Constitution of South Africa.

 Equally so, section 204 of the Constitution of the Republic of South Africa, has institutionalised civil–military relations through a civilian Secretariat. In terms of section 204 “a civilian secretariat for Defence must be established by national legislation to function under the direction of the Cabinet member responsible for Defence.” Giving substance to this Constitutional imperative is section 8 of the Defence Act, No 42 of 2002 which spells out the scope of operations of the Defence Secretariat. The task directive encapsulates provision of policy advice to the Minister, enhancing civil control and oversight, comprehensive instructions and ensuring SANDF compliance to MOD&MV directives. 

 At a work session in September 2009, the Defence Secretariat developed a blueprint for a vision of building a responsive and dependable Defence secretariat for the third decade. The blueprint culminated in the ground breaking September 2010 Margate DOD Resolution that formalised the separation of norms and standards from execution. The aforementioned resolutions concerned the MOD&MV priority on alignment of the Defence Secretariat with its constitutional and legislative mandate; viz “A review of the Defence Secretariat to align with the mandate of the Defence organisation and support requirements for the Minister of Defence and Military Veterans.”

 Furthermore, in an attempt to achieve more with little, the President of the Republic of South Africa adopted the outcomes based approach to strategic planning, implementation and performance monitoring and evaluation so as to achieve auditable evidence of improvement of the quality of lives of citizens.

 The success in achieving the identi� ed outcomes will be the careful selection of outcomes that will have the greatest impact within the DOD in the most effective and ef� cient manner. More importantly, our ability to measure with appropriate performance indicators will ensure the Department is able to gauge the successes that we are achieving and also areas which may require intervention and support to ensure our outputs are achieved and that ultimately our outcomes are realised. 

 Furthermore, this will also imply that we need to do things differently, that we need to move away from the comfort of the familiar and take on ways of working that are different and new with heightened levels of ef� ciency and effectiveness.

 At the Cabinet Lekgotla held from 20 to 22 January 2010, we adopted the twelve (12) Medium-Term Strategic Framework (MTSF) outcomes that most accurately re� ect Government’s mandate derived from the MTSF priorities and electoral mandate. The role of Defence as the Secretariat and the coordinator of the International Co-operation, Trade and Security (ICTS) Cluster presents an opportunity for the Defence Secretariat to take centre stage in providing policy directives that will guide the footprint of Defence as well as provide a focused approach to management of the � ve security domains.

 The phased implementation of border safeguarding has seen the Defence Force deployed for border safeguarding along the borders of RSA and its neighbouring countries since April 2010. Currently, the Defence Force has returned to the RSA/Zimbabwe and the RSA/Mozambique border and is due to deploy along the RSA/Lesotho border on 1 April 2011. 

 From a strategic budgeting perspective it is worth indicating that the analysis of cost drivers has revealed the massive resource recapitalisation that is required to maintain the anticipated border safeguarding priority. Such State resources need to be mobilised more aggressively to ensure the success of Operation CORONA (border safeguarding).

 In embracing the government’s priority of creating decent jobs the massi�cation of the Military Skills


-----

###### the MSDS programme. Further partnerships with other organs of state, notably Sector Education and Training Authorities (SETA)s and the Department of Higher Education and Training, will be explored in the quest to expand the creation of decent work. 

 Another initiative that demonstrates the Department’s commitment to the creation of decent work is the National Youth Service (NYS) concept. In re� ning the concept in collaboration with other Government Departments, a pilot project has, in collaboration with the Department of Rural Development, commenced in Bloemfontein during this � nancial year. It is believed that this will re� ne the concept and advance implementation.

 It is against this backdrop that the Defence Secretariat has developed its Annual Performance Plan informed by the Strategic Plan. This is important for the alignment of the Defence Secretariat strategic statement so that the government outcomes oriented monitoring and evaluation approach can be achieved by working together with all relevant stakeholders.

 The Annual Performance Plan details the outcomes, outputs, activities and inputs that the Defence Secretariat is responsible and accountable for, which provides the norms and standards that support its execution, accountability and monitoring.

 Honourable Minister, I submit to you the Defence Secretariat Annual Performance Plan as evidence of the DOD’s commitment to building a responsive and dependable Defence secretariat for the third decade. It is hoped that through this Performance Plan, civil-military relations will be strengthened to the bene� t of South Africa.

 (MS N.Z.H. MPOFU) SECRETARY FOR DEFENCE

#### PART A: STRATEGIC OVERVIEW

##### CHAPTER 1
###### INTRODUCTION

 This chapter provides an overview of the constitutional and legislative origins of the Defence Secretariat, its vision, mission, Minister’s priorities, planned policy and legislative developments that will impact on strategic budgeting during the Medium-Term Expenditure Framework (MTEF) and the overview of budget and Medium- term estimates.

 The Defence Secretariat was established in terms of section 204 of the Constitution of the Republic of South Africa, 1996, given substance to by section 6 of the Defence Act, 42 of 2002 and executes its functions within the parameters of section 8 of the Defence Act 42 of 2002.

 The Secretary for Defence is furthermore, the Head of the Defence Secretariat and acts within the speci� ed  areas of responsibility to provide strategic direction to the DOD by operating under the direction of the Minister of Defence and Military Veterans.

 Under other applicable regulatory frameworks, the Secretary for Defence is the Head of the Department, the Accounting Of� cer, the Information Of� cer and the principal adviser to the Minister of Defence on Defence policy matters.

 The development of norms and standards which the Defence Secretariat is responsible for, enhances the DOD’s compliance with the appropriate regulatory frameworks as they relate to resource mobilisation, utilisation and accounting.

 STRATEGIC FOCUS

 As illustrated in the Vote 22 Chapter of the Estimate of National Expenditure (ENE), to continue to deliver on its mandate, the DOD focuses on strategic priorities determined in response to changing circumstances. By implication, the role of the Defence Secretariat focuses on the implementation of these emerging priorities aimed at the realization of the Defence mandate.

 ALIGNMENT WITH GOVERNMENT OUTCOMES

 The Defence Secretariat provides for the coordination of the Department’s contribution to MTSF Outcomes 2, 3, 5 11 and 12. In this regard, the Defence Secretariat provides the necessary support to the Minister to perform the coordination role of the International Cooperation, Trade and Security (ICTS) Cluster. Furthermore, the Defence Secretariat coordinates the DOD’s inputs to other MTSF priorities.

 ARRANGEMENT OF THE PLAN

 The Annual Performance Plan (APP) consists of three parts, packaged in chapters and covers the following aspects:

 �� Part A. A strategic overview which provides insight into the organisational environment, performance environment of the Defence Secretariat, an updated situational analysis and the associated � nancial information.

 �� Part B. Information pertaining to the Defence Secretariat Outputs linked with the MTSF Outcomes is provided as well as the information on risk management, utilisation of consultants, Private Public Partnerships and the Public Entities reporting to the Executive Authority.

 �� Part C. This Chapter provides links to other plans.

 It is the intended that each of the parts as alluded to above will display the logical progression of the linkage between the Defence Secretariat strategic planning process and the APP.

 VISION
 Excellence in governance to ensure the ef� cient and effective Defence delivery.

 MISSION
 The Defence Secretariat directs speci� ed managerial, administrative and advisory services to achieve the

 PENDING COURT RULINGS

 No applicable court rulings are noted within the Defence Secretariat which may impact on policy aspects.

 THE MINISTER OF DEFENCE AND MILITARY VETERANS (MOD&MV) PRIORITIES

 For the period ahead, the Minister has made a determination of matters considered important for the DOD to pursue as strategic priorities. The execution of these strategic priorities will enhance the effective realisation of the Defence mandate. Monitoring and evaluation of performance against these identi� ed strategic priorities will test the extent to which the Defence function has been able to “do things differently and achieve more with less”. The strategic priorities identi� ed are as follows:

 �� Execution of the Border Safeguarding Function. The safeguarding of the borders of South Africa remains one of the key functions of the SANDF. The phased in approach, adopted by the SANDF in undertaking this function, will continue in FY2011/12 with the � nal phase completed in FY2012/13.

|Act|Key Responsibilities Placed on the DOD|
|---|---|
|Section 204 of the Constitution of the RSA, 1996 (Act 108 of 1996)|“A civilian secretariat for Defence must be established by national legislation to function under the direction of the cabinet member responsible for Defence”.|
|Defence Act 42 of 2002|Section 6: Establishment of the Defence Secretariat Section 7: Appointment of the Sec Def as a head of the department by the Presidency. Section 8: Functions of the Sec Def. Section 9: Delegation of powers and assignment of duties by the Sec Def.|

|Treasury Regulations 5 and 30 (amended)|Prescribes the planning and reporting process (Strategic Plans and Annual Performance Plan) for Government Departments and Public Entities.|


-----

###### �� Establishment of the New Service Dispensation. The Defence Amendment Act, 22 of 2011, has been enacted. As intended, the Defence Amendment Act has created a new service dispensation for the SANDF members. In FY2011/12 the DOD shall focus on the implementation of the afore-mentioned  amendment in order to realise this dispensation. Consequential amendments to other Acts will also be taken into account.

 �� Enhancement of the SANDF’s Landward Defence Capabilities. In order to undertake all required missions, the enhancement of the Landward Defence Capabilities is essential. For the Landward Defence Capability to operate jointly with the Air Defence and Maritime Defence Capabilities, this enhancement is considered a priority. The Landward Defence Capability has not enjoyed the advantage of being part of the Strategic Defence Packages and is thus lacking technologically advanced Primary Mission Equipment.

 �� Maritime Security. The Defence and security of South Africa is inextricably linked to that of the region and the continent. Being a littoral country, South Africa needs to have a balanced maritime capability to effectively respond to arising maritime security threats affecting South Africa. 

 �� Job Creation. In support of the government initiative on job creation, the DOD plans to create job opportunities in the following areas:

 �� Filling of all 1 401 vacant funded positions in the DOD. �� Recruitment of 5 700 young South Africans per year to the Military Skills Development System (MSDS). �� Call up of 16 400 Defence Reserve members per year to undertake speci� c tasks over speci� c periods of time. �� The enhancement of the DOD Works Capability to create opportunities for people with technical skills within the SANDF. This in turn will allow for the SANDF intakes to increase with the same number of the SANDF members transferred to the DOD Works Capability.  �� Creation of job opportunities in the Defence Industry through approved DOD projects.

 �� Enhancement of the SANDF’s Peacekeeping Capability (SANDF Deployability). The role of the SANDF in promoting peace and security in the region and the continent necessitates the enhancement of the SANDF’s peacekeeping capability that will include the SANDF’s Forward Deployment Capability.

 �� National Youth Service. The implementation of the National Youth Service by using core Defence capabilities to provide initial training to the youth prior to absorption into service delivery departments.

 �� Revitalisation of the Reserves. As part of the One Force concept, the Reserves must be transformed and revitalised to ful� l the various important Defence roles allocated to them.

 �� Restructuring and Support of the Defence Industry. The restructuring should focus on Defence capability, the interactive framework and function alignment in order to properly synchronise these with the requirements and mandate of Defence. The emphasis should be on Governance, Risk Management, Compliance and Accountability framework applicable within Defence Portfolio.

 �� Department of Defence Works Capability. The state of the DOD facilities portfolio calls for the review of the existing arrangements for the repair and maintenance of Defence facilities. The establishment of the DOD Works Capability seeks to achieve an end state where the DOD will have an in-house capacity that will ultimately assume the full responsibility of the Defence facilities repair and maintenance. The DOD Works Capability will at the same time create job opportunities in the DOD, thus contributing to the Government’s priority of job creation.

 DOD POLICY PROPOSALS IN SUPPORT OF THE PRIORITIES OF THE MOD&MV

 In support of the MOD&MV by the Defence Secretariat in the achievement of the above-mentioned ministerial priorities, the Defence Secretariat will undertake the following planned policy proposals.

 �� Development of a policy framework to form the basis of the Defence Amendment Act 22 of 2010 and its implementation.

 �� Development of the Defence Security Strategy contributing to the National Security Strategy. This development will set the broad context for the development of a National Security strategy.

 �� Defence contribution to the Crime Prevention Strategy of Government which will include support to the JCPS Cluster priorities and requirements.

 �� Finalisation of the DOD Border Management Strategy which includes Border Safeguarding.


-----

###### �� The National Youth Service Conceptual and policy framework to set the norms and standards which the DOD will follow in order to ensure the achievement of the targets (DOD representation) as set in the delivery agreement of MTSF Outcome 5 namely “Skilled and capable workforce to support an inclusive growth path”.

 �� Establishment of research capacity in the Policy Division in order to inform policy development and formulation. This will include international benchmarking and best practice analysis with other Defence sectors.

 �� Review of the White Paper on Defence Related Industries and development of a Defence Industry Strategy to strategically position the Defence function to maximise the responsiveness of the Defence Industry in supporting the delivery of the mandate.

 �� Defence Related Public Entities Strategy to include the transformation of Armscor and proposals on the Repositioning of Denel.

 �� Assets and Facilities Management Policy Framework to enable the DOD to assume full responsibility for the management and maintenance of facilities and � xed assets.

 �� The repositioning of the DOD “Shared Staffs” functions to allow for the execution of the Defence Secretariat and the SANDF distinct yet complimentary roles. 

 �� Development of an HR Development Policy and Skills Development Plan which will include the � nalisation of a DOD Skills Audit.

 �� Development of a Defence Fiscal and Defence Capability Framework.

 �� An Armed Forces Day policy Framework that facilitates armed forces engagements with the national citizenry is to be developed.

 The Defence Secretariat will furthermore ensure that the Ministerial priorities are executed within the framework of governance, risk, compliance and accountability management principles. The strategic resourcing of the above-mentioned priorities will underpin Departmental funding initiatives if and where so required to ensure full support to the Executive Authority.

 SITUATIONAL ANALYSIS

 The Defence Secretariat APP for the period of the FY 2011/12 to FY 2013/14 has been developed taking into consideration the priorities of government. This top-down approach has been used in the development of this APP, which is linked with the Strategic Plan and the Budget for the MTEF. This APP includes performance information in terms of outputs for the Changed (MTSF Outcomes) and Sustained Agenda (Legislative Mandate). The Defence Secretariat APP will outline mainly how a sound direction will be provided to Defence in order for the MOD&MV to realise the achievement of its priorities which are linked to the relevant MTSF Outcomes.

 ORGANISATIONAL ENVIRONMENT

 It is envisaged that a review of the Defence Secretariat will be completed and implemented in order to align this constitutionally mandated establishment with support requirements of the Minister of Defence. The current Defence Secretariat Organisational Structure is indicated in � gure below:

###### The Defence Secretariat budget is located within Programme 1: Administration of the current Defence Budget Programme Structure. It is envisaged that the programme structure will be structured according to the two Defence Entities (Defence Secretariat and SANDF) and not the DOD as a whole. This will ensure that the Secretary for Defence (Sec Def) and the Chief of the SANDF (C SANDF) take responsibility for what is rightfully theirs and hence there will be Annual Reports for each entity. Reporting will then be simpli� ed in this case.

 The Table below re� ects the full cost of the sub-programmes under Programme 1: Administration. This includes the budget for shared services such as Finance Services, Legal Services and the Human Resource Services. The budget of Defence Secretariat Divisions that lies with the SANDF, or in respect of which the budget holder is at the SANDF, are not clearly re� ected in this table since the breakdown is not available.

###### OVERVIEW OF SUB-PROGRAMME PURPOSE

 The Defence Secretariat resides under the Administration Programme. The sub–programmes’ purpose that fall under the Defence Secretariat is illustrated in the Table below.[4]

 BUDGET PROGRAMME STRUCTURE OF THE DEFENCE SECRETARIAT

 In order to ensure Strategic Budgeting and reporting for the DOD, the outputs of the department are presented in terms of programmes that are all-encompassing. The programmes represent the contribution of various Services and Divisions within the DOD. However, the programmes will be restructured in order to ensure that the Defence Secretariat supports the achievement of the DOD mandate and outcomes.

 CHANGES TO BUDGET PROGRAMME STRUCTURE

 No changes to the budget Programme Structure have been made. However, it is envisaged that the budget programme structure will be aligned with the National Treasury Framework for Budget Programme Structure for the MTEF FY 2012/13-FY 2014/15 (i.e. Programmes should be grouped within the three categories, namely Support Service Programmes, Service Delivery Programmes and Enabling Programme).

 The current Defence Secretariat budget programme structure with its associated purpose is depicted in Table 5 below through which the outputs of the Defence Secretariat will be achieved.

###### DEFENCE SECRETARIAT OUTCOME

 The Defence Secretariat Outcome to support the realisation of the MTSF Outcomes is “Enhanced Civil Control[5] of Defence”.

 DEFENCE SECRETARIAT OUTPUTS AND ANNUAL TARGETS

 The Defence Secretariat outputs will support the DOD Outcomes which are linked to the Minister’s Delivery Agreement.

 The Minister of Defence has signed the Delivery Agreements for Outcomes 11 but will contribute to the following outcomes:

 �� Outcome 2 - A long and healthy life for all South Africans. �� Outcome 3 - All people in South Africa are and feel safe. �� Outcome 5 - Skilled and capable workforce to support an inclusive growth path. �� Outcome 11 - Create a better South Africa, a better Africa in a better world. �� Outcome 12 - An ef� cient, effective and development oriented public service and empowered, fair and inclusive citizenship.  

 The MOD&MV will, in terms of the Delivery Agreement play a leading role in terms of Outcome 11 and contribute to Outcome 2, 3, 5 and 12 as stated above. The signing of Delivery Agreements for the above- mentioned outcomes by the MOD does not prevent the DOD from contributing to other MTSF Outcomes. The performance information of the DOD is therefore derived from the linkage of different priorities and strategies as depicted in � gure 2 below.

 The APP will only re� ect the performance indicators which are in support of the Defence Secretariat Outcomes and Outputs which will then be linked to the relevant MTSF Outcomes as outlined above.

 The Defence Secretariat Outputs, Activities and Inputs that support the DOD outcomes are listed in the table below:

###### RISK MANAGEMENT The DOD fully understands its statutory obligations in respect of Enterprise Risk Management. To that end, the DOD will continue to enhance the risk management culture as contemplated in section 38(1) (a) (i) of the PFMA, (Act 01 of 1999) as amended. For the MTEF period (FY2011/12 to 2013/14), the DOD focus will be on the approved DOD Enterprise Risk Management Framework and the enhancement of the Enterprise risk architecture through the revision of the current risk management policy and strategy. 

 The DOD is guided by the Public Sector Risk Management Framework of 2008, which aims to support institutions to improve and sustain their performance by enhancing their systems of risk management.

 The main Defence Secretariat risks that could impact on the realization of the outputs are tabulated below:

 Table 24: Defence Secretariat Risks

|Table 24: Defence Secretariat Risks|Col2|
|---|---|
|Enterprise Risk|Mitigation Strategy/Action|
|Full Compliance with Regulatory Framework. The DOD’s inability to fully comply with the regulatory framework requirements in respect of accounting and supply chain management.|Implementation of best practice supply chain and life cycle management. The acquisition of a single logistic information management system that is compliant with National Treasury and Auditor-General reporting requirements is being investigated. Until then, manual work-around and enhancements of legacy Defence logistics systems are being implemented.|
|The DOD Infrastructure and Facilities’ State of Disrepair. Continued deterioration of DOD infrastructure, facilities and equipment due to insuffi cient funding. This situation constrains the DOD from executing its mandate effectively.|The verifi cation of the DOD asset portfolio is under way. Closer management of the DOD and Public Work Department’s respective rights and obligations on infrastructure and facilities’ maintenance. The DOD Internal maintenance /works capabilities are being enhanced.|
|The Non-Integration of DOD IT Systems. The non-integration of information systems (Finance, Supply Chain Management and Human Resources systems) and inadequate information technology network has a negative impact on the DOD’s performance.|Analysis of all DOD IT systems for integration options. Seek National Treasury permission for the procurement of a single logistic management system that will allow for integration with other IFMS modules. The IFMS roll-out plan to be implemented to mitigate reliance on manual controls or other external systems.|
