_National Security Strategy of the Republic of Bulgaria_ _28_

**National Security Strategy**

**of the Republic of Bulgaria**

Approved by National Assembly Decision of 25.02.2011, promulgated, Durzhaven Vestnik,
No 19/8.03.2011

**I. Introduction**

**1. The national security policy of the Republic of Bulgaria rests on the values of democracy,**
the national culture, human and civil rights, equal opportunities for self-fulfillment,
the Constitution of Bulgaria and the underlying acts that guarantee international security.

**2.** The National Security Strategy embodies the peacefulness and the traditions of good
neighborly relatiom and mutually advantageous cooperation that characterize Bulgaria's policy.
The Strategy is an integral part of the European Union's and NATO's efforts geared to expand
the zone of stability, cooperation and prosperity by the elimination of threats that emanate from
terrorism and extremism and by the settlement of regional conflicts and active involvement
in the solution of global problems. The country's contribution to the stability of state-to-
state relations and to the application of the principle of non-interference in the internal affairs
of the Balkan Penimula and the Black Sea Region countries is of particular importance.

**3.** While the Strategy frames a broader concept of national security by making paramount
the security of the citizen and the social and economic aspects, it does not underrate the dimension
of defense, foreign policy, intelligence, public order and law-enforcement. More than ever before
it is evident that the end product and the genuine meaning of the "national security" concept is
the protection of the individual citizen and of his inalienable freedom and dignity.

**4.** The National Security Strategy of the Republic of Bulgaria gives a catalog of the
national interests and of the conditions and prerequisites required for their materialization
by the elimination of the risks and threats to the country and to its citizens. The national and
sectoral priorities and security policies are geared to protect the national interests with due regard
for the fast-changing security context and given an optimal allocation of resources to achieve
efficient security system management.

**5. The National Security Concept that was approved in 1998 was the pioneer in the formulation**
of the definition of national security that was codified in the Classified Information Act and in the
Act on the State Agency for National Security.

**6.** While the National Security Concept institutionalized top-level Executive power advisory
and coordinating activities, it enabled members of other responsible factors to join in the security
policy formulation, implementation and control. First steps were taken to develop a national
security system and an intelligence community in the Republic of Bulgaria. The Government
started to report regularly to the National Assembly on the national security status, the national
security protection policies and the upholding of the national interests. The process did not evolve
in subsequent periods.

**7.** The Concept was particularly important in making public, to the society at large and
to the potential NATO allies, the national security policy values, objectives, principles and


-----

mechanisms. The document inspired the Military Doctrine of the Republic of Bulgaria and other
strategy papers and legislative acts.

**8.** The national security strategies that were drafted in 2005 and 2008 never reached
the approval procedure stage. However, the drafting process enabled judgments of the dynamism
of national objectives and interests, of the changes in the security context and of the requirements
deriving thereof to security policy.

**9. Following Bulgaria's accession to NATO and to the European Union (EU), the country's security**
strategy was no longer confined to the national dimension and was incorporated into our allies'
efforts. The risks and threats to the security of the Republic of Bulgaria and of its citizens are largely
identical with or similar to what the EU and NATO member countries face.

**10. The existing and newly emerging threats'dynamism which is in the form of parallel occurring**
processes that improve the international political and military security context and minimize
the probability of conventional armed aggression against the Republic of Bulgaria and to which
new criminal and transborder risks and threats to citizens and the society are to be added, calls for
a new approach to the development of a security strategy with adequate update of parameters.

**11. Adjustment to the changing security context calls for reprioritization of security policies,**
the involvement of the society's whole institutional potential and the application of new forms
of interaction between the State, the businesses and the non-governmental sectors, as for
instance private-public partnerships. The expansion of the security policy social range faces
the horizontal and vertical institutional coordination of the "chain of command" management
with new challenges. Institutions and their structural units must act as integrated components
of the national security system.

**12. The policies designed to avert risks and threats to national security and to guarantee that**
citizens and democratic institutions are protected are part and parcel of the EU's and NATO's
combined efforts geared to translate into reality the vision of a single area of freedom, security and
justice. While the country implements its strategic priorities to build a more stable and democratic
state where citizens feel safe to exercise their fundamental rights and to fulfill their obligations,
it surmounts the existing barriers to its further integration in the EU and NATO and seeks to join
more effectively their governing bodies.

**13.** The security policy prepares the institutions, society and citizens to respond in a highly
volatile security context and to generate conditions in which the interests of the Republic
of Bulgaria can be achieved. Bulgaria's common and sectoral security policy rests on the security
context assessment and on the attainment and advancement of the national interests.

**14.** Bulgaria's National Security Strategy is an underlying document for the agreed formulation,
planning, implementation, coordination and control of the national security policy as pursued
by the institutions of the State in collaboration with the citizens and the civil society
organizations.

**15. The implemented National Security Strategy will guarantee the rights, freedoms, security**
and well being of the individual and of the society, will guard the sovereignty and territorial integrity
of the country and the unity of the nation, will protect the Constitution-established system and
democratic values and will shield the population and the critical infrastructure whenever crises,
disasters, industrial accidents or catastrophes and other risks and threats occur.

**16. The National security system is put in place to achieve modern manageability of the efforts**
of the central government institutions, local authorities, corporate entities, citizens and civil society

organizations geared to guarantee the principles of democracy and sustainable development
of the national economy and the country's well being.

**17. The Strategy's time horizon is 2020.**

**II. The fundamentals**

**_II. 1. National security policy principles_**

**18. The National Security Strategy rests on the following principles:**

rule of law and equality of all citizens before the law;

interdependence of security and the citizens'fundamental rights and freedoms;

dialog and enhanced partnership between the citizens, the society and the State;

mutual confidence between the State institutions and cooperation with the private sector,
NGOs and citizens, with the NATO and EU allies and with partner countries;

national consensus on the national security policy;

the inseparability of the national security from the NATO and EU security;

proactive coordination in the activities of State institutions and organizations in line with
their competences;

integrated interinstitutional approach to the development of the national security system;

openness, transparency and accountability in security policy formulation and making;

-  efficiency and effectiveness of the decision-taking and decision implementation process;

democratic control on the national security system.

**_11.2. National interests_**

**19. The interests of vital importance are:**

to guarantee the rights, freedoms, security and well being of the individual, of the society
and of the State;

to defend the sovereignty and territorial integrity of the country and the unity
of the nation;

-  to protect the Constitution-established system and to uphold democratic values;

to defend the population and the critical infrastructure in the event of crises, disasters,
accidents, catastrophes and other risks and threats;

to save and promote the national identity on the basis of civil unity;

to ensure the integrity of Bulgarian civil society;

to address the negative demographic developments and sizeable regional development
gaps and to promote a socio-economic environment which is friendly to the fulfillment
of generations of Bulgarian citizens who are capable of securing the place that the Republic


-----

_National Security Strategy of the Republic of Bulgaria_ _31_

of Bulgaria deserves to hold in the EU and in global political, economic, financial and social
developments.

**20.** Other important interests are:

favorable and predictable security context;

efficient operation of Bulgarian institutions along with EU and NATO institutions to the end
of collective security and its enhancement by the promotion of interoperability;

maintenance of good neighbor relations and of regional security and stability;

-  development of regional Black Sea cooperation;

achievement of energy security by the diversification of the energy sources, energy suppliers
and transportation routes and other strategic resources;

promotion of education, training, science and R&D along the lines of the national and shared
European values;

maintenance of economic, financial and social stability and prosperity;

preventing and countering corruption and organized crime;

preclusion of encroachments upon property and of offences against persons;

enhancement of the environment and of the natural resources.

**Ill. Security context: risks and threats**

**1.** Peace, security, development and prosperity are interdependent more than ever before.
The security context is assuming special importance for developments within the society and
the life of citizens. The interdependence of personal, national and international security is
growing.

**22.** External and internal security is increasingly interdependent and the demarcation line
is becoming provisional. International financial-economic and political developments impact
strategically the internal security context as do the energy projects, Bulgaria's commitments to
uphold modern democratic values, to defend and control the EU external borders and to combat
transborder crime.

**23.** By their nature and forms the risks and threats become increasingly asymmetric and
substantially impact the global and regional security context.

**_111.1. External security context_**

**24.** Globalization remains a leading trend that will continue to impact the overall external
security context. Apart from globalization, other key change factors will be the possible shift of
the economic growth focus from the West to the East, the growing impact of non-governmental
structures, including corporate and religious entities, and developments in the energy sector,
migration, poverty and development issues and climate change.

**25.** Bulgaria's membership in NATO and EU and the fact that none of the neighbor countries
considers it a potential aggressor are the external security determining factors and will deter direct
military threats to its sovereignty and territorial integrity in the long term.

**26.** Integration developments within the EU and trans-Atlantic cooperation are instrumental in
the settlement on key international matters. The EU and NATO initiatives and actions make them


-----

_National Security Strategy of the Republic of Bulgaria_ _32_

increasing factors in strengthening international security.

**27.** Asymmetric threats, especially international terrorism and the proliferation of weapons
of mass destruction (WMD), regional conflicts, cyber crime and transborder organized crime
substantially impact the global and regional security context.

**28. Terrorism is a serious threat to global security. Regional conflicts and economic and financial**
crises further exacerbate that threat. Terrorist organizations decentralize their structures, diversify
their modi operandi and ably infiltrate into the democratic society, hence it is difficult to dismantle
them. The possibility to use radioactive matter, toxic substances and bio-agents and to hack into
databases and to access technologies to be put to terrorist ends is growing.

**29.** Risks of the WMD proliferation are growing as different states seek to get hold of them.
The stockpiles of nuclear weapons and radioactive material in individual countries remain a risk.

**30.** Transborder organized crime is a major challenge to the security of citizens and the
democratic foundation of society. It comprises economic crimes, the illicit production of and
trafficking in drugs, the trafficking in human beings and their abuse, smuggling, the printing and
circulation of counterfeit money and documents, cyber crime, money laundering, etc. Organized
crime breeds corruption and thrives on corruption.

**31. Cyber crime is a global and anonymous threat to information systems. Destructive impacts**
on information systems and networks may cause a crisis by impeding and/or paralyzing the normal
functioning of systems or components that are critical to the economy, the financial system or the
national government.

**32.** The failed states that are unable to guarantee the security, rights and freedoms of their
citizens, to manage social relations and to meet their international commitments are a serious
problem to international security.

**33.** Piracy and abduction of merchant fleet crews particularly in open sea around the coast
of Africa and Southeast Asia are a new alarming phenomenon. The non-response to this
phenomenon which is strange in the 21st century makes it a serious threat to world trade and
transportation and to the security of sailing crews and passengers.

**34. The unstable economic and political situation and the low standard of living in Third World**
states and regions generate a migration pressure on the country as an external EU border.

**35. The risks to environmental security emanate from industrial accidents that cause hazardous**
emissions, transborder air, water and coastal pollution and from the threat of terrorism that will
use substances that are extremely hazardous to the environment. The protection of corporate
interests slows down the adoption ofreal measures to solve these problems in a broad international
context.

**36.** The implementation of strategic international transport and energy projects enhances
the security context level of certainty. This will not unilaterally improve the security context and
calls for defense capabilities for the critical infrastructure.

**37.** The globalization of transport is conducive to the fast spread of infectious diseases and
pandemics, exposes the states and the citizens, including their troops in international missions
and in operations in locations where nature is hostile.

**38.** Energy security is an element of national security and a factor for economic stability. States
become increasingly interdependent on vital resources - energy, water, raw materials and food,
hence the higher risk of crisis emergence. Problems in that area become a most serious risk for all
countries no matter how economically advanced they are and how much resource they possess.

**39. The trend offurther stabilization and full integration into Euro-Atlantic and European space is**
dominating in South east Europe. The reduction of military capabilities of the states, the expansion
of bilateral and regional cooperation, the growth of the regional market and the implementation
of joint projects in different sectors are all conducive to that. The NATO and EU membership of states
from this region and the gradual integration of the West Balkan states into European and Euro-
Atlantic structures underpin the growing tendencies of cooperation and good neighborliness.
The accession of Bulgaria and Romania to NATO and EU projects a strong stabilizing effect for the
whole region.

**40.** Positive tendencies prevail in the West Balkans owing to the international community's
active commitment to solve usual and newly emerging problems. An important step towards
enduring stability of the region was made by the accession of Albania and Croatia to NATO in 2009
and by keeping the door open to other states from the region in the next enlargement. However,
some serious risks continue to face the democratic and sustainable development of states in the
region. Attempts continue to revive typecast survivals that stem from the specific regional reality
and that constitute a risk to security.

**41. The Republic of Bulgaria views the Black Sea region in a broad European and Euro-Atlantic**
context in order to promote cooperation between countries in economy, trade and security. The
region is assuming particularly great importance in the pipeline business that transports fuels
from the countries where they are located to Europe's energy markets. The importance of the
region is growing given Bulgaria's active role in the maintenance of international peace and its
commitments to guard the NATO and EU external borders.

**42.** Middle East developments spell uncertain future for the region and an incipient lengthy
transformation. The situation and the prospects in the region constitute a serious challenge to
the EU and NATO countries. Changes are possible that might result in democratic government
and balanced economic and social development. Alongside, there exist evident risks of stronger
migration pressure, stronger influence of radical movements and mobilization of international
terrorist networks in the vicinity of Europe. The ambition of some countries to pursue nuclear
and/or missile programs leads to further risks that may complicate the situation. The elimination
of the risks and the maintenance of the positive trends in the states in the region should be in
the core of the new Euro-Atlantic strategy in whose development Bulgaria will take an active and
constructive part while it recognizes its specific national interests.

**43.** NATO and EU have substantial responsibilities to the sustainable and enduring stability in
Afghanistan; this mission demands the parallel solution of a set of diverse problems -the political
and economic stability of the region, the fight against terrorism and radical Islam, the prevention
of the production of and of the trafficking in drugs and of the trafficking in human beings.

**111.2. Internal security context**

**44.** The key positive internal security factors, include, inter alia, the enhancement of the role
of democratic institutions and procedures, a functioning market economy and financial stability,
socio-economic stability and progress, civil service reform and key institutions reform in the
context of European integration.

**45.** All key documents of the United Nations Organization, the Council of Europe and the
European Union vis-a-vis respect fo_r human rights and fundamental freedoms are an integral part
of the national legislation. Relevant pieces of legislation have been passed and the implementing
institutions have been set up. The country has adopted the legal arrangements and put
up the institutions to protect human rights and fundamental freedoms, including the right to


-----

_National Security Strategy of the Republic of Bulgaria_ _34_

self-determination, free self-organization for the development of communities that are formed
on the basis of ethnic, age, religious, professional or other attribute.

**46.** An essential contribution is made by security and public order services that are engaged
in early warning and other activities within the range of their competence in the interest
of the national security. Cooperation is enhanced with the counterpart structures of NATO and EU,
of member states and of other states.

**47. The European Commission's Cooperation and Verification Mechanism in justice and home**
affairs is instrumental in addressing the deficiencies in the Judiciary reform and in countering
corruption and organized crime.

**48.** Corruption in general and high level corruption in particular remains a major problem
in modern Bulgarian society. Corruption spreads in consequence of the non-transparent way
in which property changed hands, of the inadequate regulation of socio-economic relations,
inefficient control and omissions in the administration of justice. Corruption threatens the existence
of and compliance with social, legal and moral rules, reinforces organized crime, undermines
the credibility of authorities, weakens their functioning and discredits reforms. Corruption feeds
on the deficiencies in central and local government which deliberately or incompetently
increases the number of licenses and makes them increasingly complicated and on the absence
of transparency and consistency in the public procurement process and in public funds
spending.

**49. Organized crime, transborder crime and particularly the trafficking in drugs are some major**
threats. Economic crimes related to the so-called grey economy have the strongest large-scale
devastating impact as do the increasingly ingenious money laundering schemes that defraud
the national budget and cause damage to welfare and public interest. These forms of crime
undermine the principles of free competition, curtail consumer rights, discourage free enterprise
and worsen the investment climate.

**SO. Common or conventional crime likewise continues to be a threat to citizens'daily life; higher**
risk zones emerge in some regions and communities where citizens don't feel safe and certain as
far as their life and property is concerned. If such people happen to live in places with sizably
declining population or being depopulated they feel even less safe.

**51.** Beside by crime, citizens' safety and interests are affected by bad governance, red tape,
abuse of power, mismanagement of state- and municipality-owned assets and property.

**52. The relatively high road accident statistics and the consequences of such accidents coined**
the phrase "road warfare"which every year takes a heavy toll of human lives.

**53.** The public health status has been worsening over the years. Sizeable groups of
the Bulgarian society are undereducated and unqualified. These negative trends become more
and more pronounced as certain communities from ethnic minorities are insufficiently integrated
into the mainstream of society. The deep social stratification which is often seen as intolerably
unjust holds disintegration potential. Assets whose origin in a number of cases is inexplicable
undermine the integrity of the State which is to stand up as the pillar of law abidance and challenge
the credibility of citizens who prosper on the basis of their earned income.

**54. Drawing on the economic crisis and on the growing opportunities to travel, organized crime**
became very active in the illicit migration and in the trafficking in human beings, in particular
in women and even girls, for sexual exploitation and for inclusion in criminal street gangs.
The Bulgarian law-enforcement authorities' systematic and coordinated operations in
collaboration with other states' homologues considerably downscaled these crimes and thus
helped Bulgaria's accession to the EU.

_National Security Strategy of the Republic of Bulgaria_ _35_

**SS.** Heavy dependence on energy resources creates economic and political vulnerabilities.
The projects to diversify energy sources and transportation routes impact the geopolitical reality
in the Balkans and in Europe and project directly into Bulgaria's national security.

**56. The state of the transport, energy and communication infrastructure, the shortage of public**
finance and inefficient public finance management negatively impact the national security.

**57.** Social uncertainty and glaring social stratification hold sizable conflict potential. Illegally
amassed wealth erodes the public perception of social justice.

**58.** Risks to environmental security emanate from soil, water and air pollution and
from the depletion of natural resources in consequence of improper operations, weaker
controls and accidents or disasters.

**59. The never-ending reorganization of the security services and law-enforcement authorities**
with no strategic reform framework in place made them less efficient in defending security and in
countering crime.

**60.** The fundamental legal framework of classified information is in place as are the relevant
institutions and mechanisms and a lot of practical experience has been gained. Gaps have been
detected in the prevention of unauthorized access to classified information.

**_111.3. The security context: general conclusions_**

**61. The external security context that will impact the national security will have the following**
characteristics: interplay of multiple asymmetrical factors, high dynamism, indefiniteness,
developments that are ambiguous and difficult to predict.

**62.** The security context trends indicate that new conflict and crisis situations might emerge
in future in different parts of the world, so the risks and threats to Bulgaria's national security will
have to be averted outside the country within the allied effort of NATO and EU.

**63. There is not a state capable of dealing on its own with these risks and threats. This makes**
it imperative to find multilateral approaches to the solution of problems that are important
for development and security and intensifies the interdependence of policies pursued nationally
and internationally.

**64. The United Nations, NATO, EU, OSCE and other international organizations have an important**
role in preventive diplomacy, crisis management, post-conflict stability, promotion of democracy,
respect for human rights and for the rule of law. The influence of international financial, economic
and trade organizations is expanding and positively impacts the security context.

**65.** While the influence of external factors grows, internal factors will remain crucial
for the national security situation.

**IV. Security policy**

**_IV. 1. In general_**

**66.** The security policy seeks to give citizens a stronger feeling of security as it creates
the conditions and preconditions required to guarantee the national interests, to minimize the
impact of risks and threats and to optimize the allocation of resources.

**67.** The national security policy is a set of interrelated priorities and sectoral policies that


-----

_y_ _gy_ _p_ _g_

conform to the EU and NATO security policies.

**68.** Security priorities and policies are equally important for and in an equal measure effect
the national security system. They are on a par and their role and position in specific situations and
periods is determined by the security context dynamism and by the actions to take for the sake
of national interests.

**_IV.2. Priorities_**

**69.** The advancement of the principles of good governance and of countering corruption is
crucial for the national security policy as a whole and from sector to sector. This will be achieved
by means of:

continual improvement of the legislation to minimize corruption practices and bad
governance cases;

increased efficiency, transparency and accountability of institutions in their functions;

unambiguous allocation of duties and competences of the politically appointed and
administrative tiers in institutions within the Executive branch of power;

increased competence and efficiency of the Civil Service;

training officials how to detect and counter attempted corruption;

application of existing forms and development of new forms of control by NGOs and
by individuals on the politically appointed and administrative tiers;

promotion of interaction, partnership and civil society and NGO participation in the im-
plementation of anticorruption policies and measures by the Government.

**70.** A fair trial within a reasonable time builds public confidence in the government of the
State and guarantees citizens' rights and the normal functioning of institutions and of economic
entities. This will be achieved by means of:

-  guaranteed transparency and efficiency in all phases of the administration of justice;

improved professional skills of the police, the prosecution and the court and promotion
of the forms of accountability to the public;

establishment of a unified information environment to monitor and control the dispensation
of justice;

guaranteed independence of the Judiciary and protection of the Judiciary against attempted
illicit solicitations;

creation of efficient trial forms to deal with socially dangerous acts and crimes that are
difficult to investigate.

**71. The encouragement of lawful businesses and the assurance of the national budget revenue**
are substantially important for the resource backup of the national security policy. This will be
achieved my means of:

improvement of the legal and institutional environment to start up and do business;

constriction of the grey economy, introduction of European standards and enhancement
of the controlling authorities' role and efficient performance;

strengthening the auditing authorities in awarding, fulfillment of and control on public
procurement contracts, concessions and public-private partnerships;


-----

_National Security Strategy of the Republic of Bulgaria_ _37_

promotion of forms of good corporate management and of the culture of accountability
by businesses and their representative organizations.

**_IV.3. Sectoral security policies_**

**Financial and economic security policies**

**72. The stability of the financial system is ensured and early alert measures are mapped out**
to "whistle" about existing or possible risk developments affecting the monetary policy, financial
stability and business turnover and to exercise permanent control on them.

**73.** Maintenance of macroeconomic stability, sustainability of the national economy and
financial system in the face of international financial and economic crises. Maintenance of the
approved Lev to Euro exchange rate until the country joins the Euro Zone. Promotion of financial
market competition.

**74. Financial institutions pursue an efficient fiscal policy in collaboration with other institutions**
of the State and in partnership with civil society organizations and private economic actors to
ensure the national budget revenue side.

**75.** Financial control authorities gear their effort to activities and entities that substantially
influence confidence in the banking system and in its stability, the citizens' savings deposits and
the functioning of the national security system.

**76. Protection of the EU financial interests by efficiently preventing and countering attempted**
fraud and mismanagement and misuse of EU funds. A common approach is developed to improve
interaction with European partners.

**77.** Maintenance of efficient supervision and non-interruption of the operation of payment
systems and of the financial infrastructure. Application of a set of measures to prevent money
laundering and money counterfeiting and also to cut off the financing for extremist, terrorist and
other outlawed activities.

**78.** The economic potential develops with the lever of a policy designed to boost labor
productivity, make production less energy- and resource-intensive, address technology
backwardness and innovatively replace production facilities.

**79.** Actions to generate an investment-friendly environment and to promote domestic
consumption, to increase exports such as value added goods and services.

**80.** The balanced economic development of regions in the Republic of Bulgaria is driven

## l '

by programs that are financed by the national budget and by EU funds.

**81. The efficient management of market levers and the restriction of the grey economy's impacts**
are handled by the existing consultative and coordinating mechanism and by the exploration
for new forms of cooperation with the unions of workers, employees and employers.
Cooperation with the private sector helps devise mechanism~ to prevent fraud and money

# t

laundering and generate conditions that are conducive to socio-economic development in
an efficient competitive environment.

**Social security policies**

**82. The Republic of Bulgaria views social security as a combination of efficacious healthcare,**
quality of life, meaningful employment, social security and social support.


-----

_National Security Strategy of the Republic of Bulgaria_ _38_

**83.** Members of ethnic minority communities are an integral part of the Bulgarian nation.
The national policy seeks to maintain the traditional relations of mutual respect between members
of different ethnic origin and between their organizations. A focused policy is formulated
to integrate emigrants into the Bulgarian mainstream society.

**84.** The Republic of Bulgaria puts forth an effort to address the demographic developments
that unfavorably impact society by the creation of economic and social conditions and by a well
educated knowledge-based society which is capable of capitalizing, to the maximum extent,
on its intellectual and creative resources.

**85.** Modernization of primary and secondary education in public and in private schools alike
by the strict application of national standards is a way to achieve high quality social security. The
development of tertiary education and R&D and science and the conservation of cultural and
historic heritage pave the way to strategic actions in planning and implementing sectoral and
general national policies for the individual's and society's development.

**86.** The Bulgarian nation takes shape and evolves on the basis of the principle of unitary
citizenship and also on the basis of the principle of solidarity which is applied strictly
to the social safety nets. The Government guarantees a minimum income and living standard
to the most vulnerable groups. The Government exercises continual and systematic control
to protect citizens' interests and to prevent sizable financial fraud and to timely detect
the fraudsters who act to the detriment of the financial interests of citizens and of their
organizations. In parallel, encouragement is provided to private initiative to guarantee income
by means of additional coverage schemes.

**87.** Special attention is devoted to controls on infectious diseases, to the prevention of the entry
and spread of infections into and around the country, to the containment of epidemic outbreaks
and of epidemics, to the use of bio-agents for terrorist purposes, to high immunization coverage
and to the organization of fast response to the emergence of situations that constitute a threat
to public health. Special actions are taken to prevent common diseases among vulnerable and
excluded social groups.

**88.** It is the understanding of social policy that misdeeds in one area lead to failures and
negative developments in another area or in all other areas. Hence the need to take measures,
by consultative and interrelated administrative actions, to avoid or else halt negative developments
as soon as they emerge.

**89. Promotion of employment and improvement of skills are supported by various policies that**
ensure earned income and opportunities for self-fulfillment.

**Energy security policy**

**90.** National security is essentially contingent on energy stability as an ongoing process
of delivery of social services that are vital for the functioning of society as a whole in the face
of likely terrorist threats, natural disasters and large-scale industrial accidents. The enhancement
of energy security as a national security element is a long-term process that calls for investment
and sustainable state policy.

**91. It is in the interest of the Republic of Bulgaria that a EU common energy policy is formulated.**
Bulgaria supports the EU strateg_ic initiatives designed to install the required infrastructure and
to diversify energy supplies. The initiatives are implemented by the agency of the existing system
of financing and by the introduction of new more efficient financial instruments of which South
East European countries may avail primarily given their great dependence on a single energy

source and their inferior energy infrastructure.

#### J 92. Interconnection with the neighbor countries' systems is a priority in guaranteeing Bulgaria's
energy security as is the increase of the natural gas storage facilities volume.

###### V 93. The Republic of Bulgaria supports international eriergy projects within the framework
of South Corridor among which NABUCCO, a EU priority, ranks first. Similarly, Bulgaria supports
the South Stream international energy project. Their implementation is bound with a civil, public,
environmental and national security assessment.

**94.** Nuclear power development is strategically important for Bulgaria's national security.
The installation of new units is institutionally supported as these will generate electricity free
of emissions and owing to the amassed successful expertise and professional competence. Nuclear
power development is strictly compliant with the nuclear waste management requirements,
shutdown rules and safety measures.
#### rJ 95. Promotion of energy efficiency and of energy saving is an energy security policy priority.
Bulgaria holds a vast energy-saving potential in the generation, transmission and consumption.
The usage of this potential contributes to faster economic growth while the dependence on
energy imports is not growing. The Republic of Bulgaria has set itself the objective to considerably
downscale the GDP energy intensity by the promotion of policies that are designed to financially
support energy efficiency, to boost a market of energy efficient products and services and to apply
regulatory measures and other levers.

**96.** The national energy security and the enhancement of the environment rely
on the implementation of Bulgaria's policies that are designed to increase the proportion
of electricity from renewable or alternative energy sources in the energy mix and to substitute
electricity with natural gas.

**97.** Bulgaria supports technology advances in production methods efficiency, in the em-
ployment of clean coal technologies, and in the application of state of the art technologies that
are compliant with European standards and affordable to the national economy potential.

**98.** Bulgaria's energy policy rests on a balanced approach to the mix of renewable energy
sources, nuclear power, natural gas, coal-fired generation and hydropower to guarantee energy
security and economic efficiency.

**99.** The Republic of Bulgaria pursues a clear and consistent regulatory policy to guarantee
the interests of national security, of the society and of citizens in the operation and development
of power generation plants and in the transmission and distribution infrastructures.

**100. The implementation of major energy projects calls for national security impact assessment,**
environmental impact assessment, assessment of compliance with the subject and objectives
of protected (listed) areas, and assessment of guaranteed security for the citizens, the society and
the State.

**101.** Energy security resource management acquires primary significance. Resource
management is part of the strategy of crisis prevention and a condition for the reliant operation
of key and critical energy, transport, communication and information infrastructure.

**102.** The Republic of Bulgaria meets commitments deriving from the Directive concerning
the protection of European and national critical infrastructure and including, as a must,
opportunities for public-private partnerships on the basis of mutual interest and partner expertise
in order to guarantee the protection of public interests and needs by efficient allocation of funds,
spread of the risks and attribution of benefits in the process.

**Security policy in man-nature relationships**

**103.** Policy security is manifest in meeting the environmental assessment and protection
standards and in joining global and regional initiatives and environment projects that are to
enhance the environment and to protect environmental security.

**104.** An essential aspect of environmental security protection is the prevention, control and
handling of the consequences of industrial accidents that discharge hazardous emissions, cause
transborder air, water and coastal area pollution, and in the face of terroristthreats to use weapons
of mass destruction.

**1 OS. The national water resources management is based on an integrated information system**
and performed by an interagency mechanism of planning, monitoring and assessment.

disasters consequences given active public involvement on the part of citizens and civil society
organizations.

**Justice and home affairs policy**

**107. The Republic ofBulgaria is fully and intensively integrated into the EU principles, objectives,**
policies, rules and practices in the field of justice. The entry into force of the Treaty Concerning
the Accession of the Republic of Bulgaria to the European Union made the country part of the
European legal area and made it binding on the country to apply a new set of rules, the acquis
communautaires, which differs essentially from international law and from the member states'
national legislations. That process has an essential impact on the Bulgarian national lawmaking
and law-enforcement process.

**108. Countering organized crime and corruption and reform of the Judiciary to make it effective,**
accountable and transparent are strategic goals.

**109.** The Judiciary bodies' specialization is a response to the dynamic evolution of the forms
of terrorism, organized crime and corruption.

**11 O. In parallel, legislation must be sophisticated in the area of the protection of prisoners'rights,**
incrimination of torture, abuse of force, auxiliary devices and arms in line with the International
Covenant on Civil and Political Rights and the European Convention on Human Rights.

**111.** Bulgaria's security and public order services interact with each other and cooperate with
private corporate entities, citizens and civil society organizations. Internationally these services
maintain sustainable cooperation with the structures of international organizations and of states
with which relations of alliance or partnership have been established.

**112.** To counter global and terrorist threat the security and public order services gear their
main effort to action, on their own or in collaboration with ally or partner services, to prevent and
thwart attempts to install cells of international terrorist and extremist organizations on Bulgarian
territory and to foil their activities.

**113.** The cooperation with the NATO and EU countries' partner services is developed
in countering the proliferation of and the illicit trade in arms, in particular small arms and light
weapons, so as to strictly observe restriction regulations, to avoid risky transactions and to make
illicit routes bypass our territory. .

_National Security Strategy of the Republic of Bulgaria_ _41_

**115.** Efficient police-civil society partnership is realized in conditions of transparency and
respect for citizens' rights and dignity. Mutual confidence is built between policemen and citizens
in the course of their daily contacts.

**116.** The Republic of Bulgaria pursues a policy of active prevention of the key factors that
generate crime and threaten public safety. The defeat of common crime calls for counteraction on
a daily basis without any tolerance for criminals.

**117.** An interinstitutional approach is advanced to achieve the objectives of countering
common, organized and transborder crime; the approach is to provide the legislation and to
consolidate the system of management, to strengthen administrative and operating capacity,
to put the information resource under integrated management, to achieve a higher degree of
interoperability that leads to integrated action with international organizations and EU institutions
and with states with which relations of partnership are maintained.

**118.** The fight against the trafficking in and the distribution and production of narcotics
and precursors is supported by the increased efficiency of the law enforcement and controlling
agencies and by their enhanced cooperation with citizens and civil society organizations.

**119.** State institutions and local authorities in collaboration with private economic entities,
citizens and civil society organizations generate conditions to steadily minimize road accidents
and their repercussions by a set of traffic safety integrated measures.

**120.** Bulgaria's accession to the Schengen Area guarantees the EU external borders security.
Bulgaria develops and maintains efficient information systems on security and public order in line
with the Schengen Agreement requirements. Competent authorities interact with the FRONTEX
(the European Agency for the Management of Operational Cooperation at the External Borders
of the Member States of the European Union) and with the homologue agencies of neighbor and
other European states.

**121.** Efficient response to crises and protection of citizens, their property and the critical
infrastructure in the event of fires, disasters and accidents and against deliberate attacks takes
an integrated approach to the establishment of an integrated, flexible and sustainable national
management system. A capacity is built for the purposes of prevention, early warning and crisis
management on the basis of information and of the prospect to exchange data with the help of,
inter alia, space and other high technologies. Integrated military and civilian crisis management
capabilities for action domestically and within the EU are developed.

**122. Countering corruption succeeds on the basis of integrated measures that are designed**
to develop the interinstitutional approach; to strengthen the management system; to put
legislation in place; to build administrative capacity; to have the information resource under
integrated management; to achieve interaction, international cooperation and operating
command. The higher efficiency of local authorities is achieved on the basis of the involvement
of citizens in local self-government. Institutions and NGOs base their work to inculcate active and
steady civic attitudes to lessen the tolerance of corruption as they launch education policies and
public awareness campaigns.

**123. In cooperation with citizens and civil society organizations the State plans, maps out and**

##### •
takes measures to halt hate speech and to suppress outbreaks of xenophobia and ethnic and
religious intolerance and other prejudice.

**124. Bulgaria's policy is geared to improve the protection of classified information and of per-**
sonal data while access to public information is ensured. Legislation, institutions and mechanisms
of the protection and use of information develop in collaboration with citizens and civil society
organizations. International law provides for and strengthens cooperation with EU and NATO

structures and with member countries and other states.

**125.** Institutional and civil potential to counter cyber crime develops accordingly. Cooperation
is maintained with private business in information and communication high technologies.
Cooperation with EU and NATO in computer security incident response is part of the security
policy.

**External security policy**

zens in line with the national interests and international commitments and also to contribute to
peace and stability in the world, to promote good neighbor relations and to build confidence
among states and nations. The Republic of Bulgaria abides by the principles and purposes of the
Charter of the United Nations and supports the efforts geared to reform the UN so as to strengthen
its capacity to achieve its purposes.

**127.** The Republic of Bulgaria aspires to enhance and promote the NATO's role in the ful-
fillment of political and operating obligations. Bulgaria wishes deeper political dialog within
NATO, the country's successful participation in NATO operations and missionsandthetransformation
of the alliance, on the basis of, inter alia, participation in multinational projects and installation
of joint antimissile defense. Bulgaria actively supports the NATO's "open-door policy" on the basis
of the conviction that the European and Euro-Atlantic perspective is the most efficient tool to
strengthen stability and security.

**128.** The Republic of Bulgaria continues to actively participate in the EU member states'
collective effort geared to an agreed and efficient policy implementation and to the application
of instruments in the field of international relations. It is particularly important that the Common
Security and Defense Policy (CSDP) develop and contribute to the consolidation of trans-Atlantic
cooperation. Bulgaria develops a national capability to participate in the EU Common Foreign
and Security Policy (CFSP), including crisis management operations and missions. The Republic
of Bulgaria will step up its contribution and intensify its commitment to EU Enlargement. Within
the framework of the European Neighborhood Policy (ENP) Bulgaria will try to take a balanced
approach to EU neighbors to the East and South as such an approach will make the EU a stronger
global security factor.

**129.** A strategic goal is to strengthen the Euro-Atlantic community's unity and to enhance
its leading role in European and global security. Bulgaria's trans-Atlantic relations develop in
a harmonious and balanced manner to enable the country's foreign policy and security priorities.

**130.** Primary importance is attached to the multi-pronged approach to the assurance of peace
and security in Europe and in the world and to avert the risks and threats that face them. Bulgaria's
foreign policy firmly abides by the principles and purposes of the Charter of the United Nations
and supports the efforts geared to reform the UN so as to strengthen its capacity to achieve its
purposes.

**131. The Republic of Bulgaria takes an active part in the establishment and maintenance of EU**
and NATO relations with the Russian Federation while it sticks to theyiew that an overall approach
should be applied to relations that concern security and cooperation with recognition of the
purposes, principles and values as laid down in the UN Charter, the North Atlantic Treaty, the Treaty
on European Union, the Statute of the Council of Europe and the OSCE underlying documents.

**138.** The Republic of Bulgaria supports the organizations of foreign citizens of Bulgarian
extraction in their effort to save their cultural identity. A new foreign policy focus is the active
protection and delivery of consular and other services to the fast growing Bulgarian communities
in an increasing number of countries.

the resources available;

the options for participation in multinational projects with the active involvement
of Bulgarian industries and research centers.

**142. The achievement of the defense policy strategic objective hinges on the country's NATO**
and EU membership. The efficiency of our membership in these organizations is crucial for making
a maximum use of the opportunities that it affords.

**143.** Our country's contribution to the international community's effort to support peace and
stability includes participation in alliance and coalition operations with troops, security services,
public order services and civilian capabilities.

or armed forces structures and to armed forces development plans and is annually treated in a
report on defense and armed forces.

**147. A defense policy priority is the development of a modern defense institution based on an**
integrated efficiently operating defense command system subject to control by the civil society

**V. National security system**

**_V. 1. Mainlines of action of the national security system_**

**148.** The system is to maintain the national security in an optimum condition, to enhance
the manageability of State institutions with the active involvement of citizens and civil society
organizations and to function efficiently to implement the Strategy. Individual citizen's safety is
the main criterion of the system's efficiency.

**149. The Strategy objectives can be achieved providing there exists a codified and institutionally**
organized process of dialog, consultation and interaction between the Legislature, the Executive
and the Judiciary, the President of the Republic, the citizens and civil society organizations.

**150.** Laws and bylaws concerning national security are tailored to the social relations evolution
and to the principles and guidelines as spelled out in the Strategy. Legislation is put in place
to create a level playing field across the National Security Area and to preclude legal incongruities
and contradictions between institutional and functional structures and mechanisms . .
**151.** Citizens and civil society organizations are both national security consumers and active
participants in the system's functioning inasmuch as they can. The State makes sure than
the system is transparent to the pubic, to the extent that it is not exposed, and contributes
to the development of civil society's capacity to act in the interest of national security.

**152.** The formulation of the State's national security policy is a responsibility of the National
Assembly, the Council of Ministers and the President of the Republic.

**153.** Vis-a-vis the national security, the National Assembly passes laws, approves the National
Security Strategy, doctrines and other documents within the range of its competence to set the
national security policy parameters. The National Assembly gives an appraisal of the state of the
national security policy and of State institutions' discharge of obligations, makes recommendations
to the central government and local authorities and to citizens and civil society organizations.

**154. The President's prerogatives in the national security policy are defined in the Constitution**
and in the national legislation. The President is the Supreme Commander of the Armed Forces and
presides over the Consultative National Security Council.

constitutes the national security system's political consultative tier. The Council's role is to help
reach broad public consensus on national security matters.

**156. The national security policy is implemented by the central government and the regional**


-----

governments. The loca I authorities and the Judiciary contribute, to the extent of their competences,
to the security policy implementation. The efficiency of the performance hinges on the mutual
trust and cooperation between the State institutions, the private sector, NGOs and citizens and also
between all those and partner states in the exchange of information and in concerted action.

**157. The Council of Ministers (the Government) is bound to submit an annual national security**
report to the National Assembly before the end of March.

**158. The interim national security priorities and the related resources are defined by the Council**
of Ministers in consultation with the President of the Republic and with the relevant standing
parliamentary committees.

**159. The cabinet ministers, chiefs of departments and regional governors bear responsibility**
for the national security within their specific remit. To exercise that responsibility they establish
the needed functional and structural organization.

**160.** Institutional capacity is built upon the principles of continuing functional interaction
and operating independence. Parallel duplication of structures is precluded as is the excessive
concentration of powers, competences and resources within one single institution. Separation
of competences and high degree of coordination are the guiding principle. The principles of a
minimum number of management decision-taking units and of optimal structures and positions
are observed in setting the top-level/administration/implementation ratio.

**161. The tools to enable the national security system management and functioning comprise:**

-  analysis and assessment of the security context condition and tendencies and adoption of
precautionary measures;

defense industrial complex are an essential element of the national security system. These bodies
coordinate the running implementation of the State policy anq advise the Government and
the relevant institutions of the State in the decision-making and decision-taking process within
the range of their competence.

**163. As a consultative and coordinating body under the umbrella of the Council of Ministers**
the Security Council proposes the decisions on the definition of the national security system
implementing agencies' strategic tasks and on crisis management; puts together the resource
planning so as to achieve a syr'1ergetic effect in the utilization of resources and coordinates
the execution of the decisions taken. The Council provides the logistics and monitors the Strategy
application. The composition and functions of the Security Council and of its units are determined
by the Council of Ministers.

regional security councils are supported by the central government and the regional governments'
bodies and structures and by recruited experts. Financing is provided under a separate spending
item on the Council of Ministers budget.

**165. The security services and, if need be, public order services, regardless of their umbrella**
authority, act to defend the national security on their own and/or in synergy within the framework
of the intelligence community. The intelligence community comprises State bodies that provide
information and make analyses to assess the risks and threats to national security, to trace their
roots and to plan and take countermeasures.

**166. The security services are engaged in intelligence and counterintelligence operations:**

to detect, avert and counteract covert attacks against the national interests and
against actions that threaten or undermine the political, economic, military and defense
capabilities;

to defend the national security and counter international terrorism and extremism,

system to function. The State builds a well-resourced codified subsystem of programs, institutions
and flexible organizational forms of training and retraining of the State institutions' staff and
of the citizens and citizens' organizations.

**168.** State institutions apply flexible forms to use the expertise and experience of Bulgarian
citizens who have professionally served in the national security sector.

**169.** General and specialist training is provided for information support to the national
security policy, crisis-specific actions and other actions that have a bearing on the advancement
of the national interests.

**170.** State institutions, universities and other educational structures and civil society
organizations work to gain experience and knowledge and to formulate innovative decisions
drawing on foreign and international theory and practice.

**_V.2. Control and accountability of bodies with immediat,: duties to the national_**
**_security system_**

civil society organizations. The Executive branch of power bodies report to Parliament and provide
information to civil society as bound by the law.

**172. The National Assembly exercises parliamentary control on the national security system's**
activity.

substance and in the same amount, to the President of the Republic and to the Speaker of the
National Assembly.

**174. The Prime Minister, the cabinet ministers, chiefs of agencies, regional governors and local**
authorities must devise mechanisms to timely inform the general public about what they do with
respect to the national security policy implementation.

**VI. Conclusion**

citizens, the society and the State in the context of the understanding of the national security
nature in a specific security context and given the interplay of existing factors. The Council of
Ministers proposes that the Strategy be timely updated to reflect the changes in the national
development priorities, in the security context and in the availability of resources.
