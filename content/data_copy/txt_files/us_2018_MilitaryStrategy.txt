### The Joint Staff


-----

The 2018 National Military Strategy (NMS) provides the
Joint Force a framework for protecting and advancing U.S.
national interests. Pursuant to statute, it reflects a
comprehensive review conducted by the Chairman with the
other members of the Joint Chiefs of Staff and the unified
combatant commanders.

As an overarching military strategic framework, this
strategy implements the substantial body of policy and
strategy direction provided in the 2017 National Security
_Strategy, the 2018 National Defense Strategy (NDS), the_
_Defense Planning Guidance (DPG), and other documents._
The 2018 NMS provides the Chairman’s military advice for
how the Joint Force implements the defense objectives in
the NDS and the direction from the President and the
Secretary of Defense.

The 2018 NMS also reflects lessons learned from
implementing global integration over the last two years. The
strategy articulates a continuum of strategic direction to
frame global integration into three strategy horizons to meet
the challenges of the existing and future security
environment. Force employment addresses planning, force
management, and decisionmaking to fulfill the defense
objectives of the NDS. Force development adapts functions,
capabilities, and concepts to improve the current Joint
Force. Force design innovates to enable the Joint Force to
do what it does differently to retain a competitive advantage
against any adversary.

The vision of the Joint Force articulated in the 2018 NMS is
a Joint Force capable of defending the homeland and
projecting power globally, now and into the future.

From its global perspective, the NMS premises an adaptive
and innovative Joint Force capable of employing its
capabilities seamlessly across multiple regions and all
domains -- continuing the transition from a regional to a
global mindset and approach.

competition with China and Russia, represent the most
difficult challenges facing the Joint Force. However, the full
scope of global integration must recognize uncertainty and
be vigilant for emerging threats to the security and interests
of the United States, its allies and partners. In a security
environment where the homeland is no longer a sanctuary
and every operating domain is contested, competitors and
adversaries will continue to operate across geographic
regions and span multiple domains to offset or erode Joint
Force advantages.

To achieve military advantage over competitors and
adversaries, the NMS introduces the notion of joint
_combined arms, defined as the conduct of operational art_
_through the integration of joint capabilities in all domains._
The Joint Force and its leaders must be as comfortable
fighting in space or cyberspace as they are in the other
three traditional domains of land, sea, or air.

To guide force employment, the 2018 NMS orients on the
defense objectives in the NDS as its ends. To implement
those ends, the 2018 NMS articulates five mutually
supporting mission areas (see inset) as the principal ways
that the Joint Force operates across the continuum of
conflict in multiple regions and in all domains. Defending
the homeland is a Joint Force activity that cuts across all
five mission areas and spans all joint functions.


**NMS Mission Areas**

- Respond to Threats

- Deter Strategic Attack (and proliferation of WMD)

- Deter Conventional Attack

- Assure Allies and Partners

- Compete Below the Level of Armed Conflict

(With a Military Dimension)


The Joint Force will leverage a wide range of means to
enhance force employment. Dynamic Force Employment
(DFE) serves as the force management framework to
prioritize preparedness for war while meeting current force
demands in day-to-day operations. By proactively shaping
the security environment through identifying and exploiting
strategic opportunities, DFE aligns Joint Force actions
across multiple global campaign plans, defense critical
missions, time horizons, warfighting domains, and
geographic boundaries.

As one of the principal methods by which the Joint Force
operationalizes the NDS’s Global Operating Model, DFE will
assist in balancing current operational needs with
readiness recovery and modernization to preserve Joint
Force competitive advantage.

The 2018 NMS acknowledges the unique contributions of
allies and partners, a strategic source of strength for the
Joint Force. Building a strong, agile, and resilient force
requires better interoperability and enhancing the combat


-----

NMS also informs engagement with interagency partners,
both abroad and domestically, to enable the Joint Force to
best support the application of all instruments of national
power throughout the continuum of conflict.

To prepare the Joint Force for employment, exercises build
readiness, interoperability, and the mutual trust required
for a joint combined arms approach to global campaigning.
Those exercises are key to building interoperability,
relationships, and capabilities of allies, partner nations,
and interagency partners, as well as enabling units and
leaders to “punch above weight class” when necessary.
Exercises can also facilitate near-term experimentation to
rapidly incorporate innovative ideas and disruptive
technologies that promote competitive advantage.

#### Force Development and Force Design

Force Development and Force Design are the expression of
Joint Force adaptation and innovation under global
integration to implement the NDS’s direction to build a
more lethal force. Force Development adapts current
planning, decisionmaking, and force management
processes to enable the Joint Force to do what it does
_better. Force Design enables the Joint Force to do what it_
does in fundamentally different and disruptive ways to
ensure the Joint Force can deter or defeat future
adversaries.

As with force employment, the ends for force development
and force design are drawn from the defense objectives of
the NDS. To implement those ends and build a combatcredible Joint Force capable of defending the homeland,
deterring competitors, and defeating adversaries, the NMS
outlines three ways oriented on the investments in the
Joint Force’s people, ideas, and equipment to maintain its
competitive advantage.


-----

the 2018 NMS provides guidance to inform the development
of a Capstone Concept for Joint Operations (CCJO). The
CCJO will express the collective vision of the Joint Chiefs of
Staff for a Joint Force designed and able to out-think, outmaneuver, and out-fight any adversary under conditions of
disruptive change. It will mark a shift to a concept-driven,
threat-informed, capability development process and
provide a campaign approach to unify service capabilities
across materiel and non-materiel solutions.

Achieving the Joint Chiefs’ vision will require people—the
Joint Force’s primary source of competitive advantage—to
continuously adapt and innovate to maintain their
competitive edge.

Consistent with the guidance laid out in the NDS, capability
investments must emphasize military advantages in
lethality and operational reach, while enabling the Joint
Force to compete effectively below the level of armed
conflict.


-----

The 2018 National Military Strategy describes a roadmap for
how the Joint Force will defend the homeland and retain its
competitive advantage to deter competitors and defeat
adversaries, whether great power competitors like China
and Russia or other security challenges, now and into the
future.

Implementation of the strategy is informed by strategic
frameworks, input from the field, and the judgment of
senior leaders. The NMS guides other joint documents
including the Joint Strategic Campaign Plan, global
campaign plans, the CCJO, and other capability
development and program advice documents, and the body
of assessments that benchmark those documents.

Collectively, the strategy and its related processes will
enable the Joint Force to provide a range of military options
that enhance the military contribution to national security
and best serve the national interests of the United States.
