# Sweden’s Defence Policy
 2016 to 2020

The most important priority in the defence bill covering the period from 2016 to 2020 is
to increase the operational warfighting capability of the Armed Forces and to ensure the
collective force of the Swedish Total Defence.

It is vital that Sweden’s defence and security policy rests on a broad political consensus.
To that extent, the Social Democratic Party, the Moderate Party, the Green Party, the
Centre Party and the Christian Democrats have agreed on a bill to parliament on the
Swedish Defence covering the years 2016 to 2020. The guiding principles for this
agreement have been the two reports by the Parliamentary Defence Commission
“Choices in a globalised world” (2013) and the “The Defence of Sweden – a stronger
defence for an uncertain time” (2014).

The five political parties agree that a follow-up on the policies proposed in the defence
bill will be conducted. The Minister for Defence will convene a group consisting of
representatives from the five political parties with the mission to review the
implementation of the defence agreement.

This defence agreement is also based on reports presented by the Swedish Armed
Forces. The agreement also includes a budgetary framework as well as the intent to
launch a long-term review of the procurement plans.

### The core of Sweden’s defence and security policy 
The Defence Commission conclusions set the objectives for Sweden’s current defenceand security policy. The core objectives are the protection of life and health, ensuring
the functioning of society, protection of our basic values of democracy, the rule of law
and human rights. Sweden's defence and security policy ultimately aims at preserving
Swedish independence and autonomy. Swedish sovereignty, rights, interests and our
fundamental values shall be protected. Our security policy aims at preserving our
freedom of action and defending against political, military or any other kind of pressure.
The protection of Swedish sovereignty and territorial integrity is a prerequisite for
achieving the above mentioned objectives. Swedish security policy is part of the
resources that Swedish society has to face the threats and challenges to our security.
Thus, Sweden’s current defence and security policy covers a large part, but not all, of
the broad perspective of security.

Security is built in solidarity with others. Sweden’s defence- and security -policy aims to
prevent war and the rise of threats to Swedish, Nordic, Baltic and European security.

Sweden gives support to the United Nations (UN) in order to contribute to global peace,
security and development. Through its membership in the European Union (EU) Sweden
assumes joint responsibility for the security of Europe and the ability of the EU to
promote peaceful and democratic development. Sweden’s cooperation with NATO
allows the Swedish Armed Forces to develop military capabilities and, by contributing to
qualified international crisis management operations, Sweden contributes to building
security together with partners.

International defence and security co-operation, in particular Nordic and Baltic cooperation, strengthens the security in our part of world. A strong transatlantic link is
crucial for Europe's security. It is in Swedish interests to maintain and further deepen
the bilateral relationship with the United States. The deepening of bilateral co-operation
with Finland is critical. The co-operation with Finland will cover operational planning and
preparations in order to be able to defend the territorial integrity of the respective
countries, including the right to self-defence as proclaimed under the Article 51 of the
United Nations Charter.

The Swedish government will commission an expert whom, based on an independent
perspective, will prepare a report on various forms of cooperation and/or membership
with countries and organisations, as well as the advantages and disadvantages for
Swedish defence and security policy, both current and future. The analysis should not
evaluate the fact that Sweden is not a member of a military alliance. It will include, for
example, the relationship to the Nordic States, Nordic-Baltic and bilateral SwedishFinnish co-operation, as well as the transatlantic link, UN, EU, OSCE and NATO. The
analysis aims to clarify the broad approach to our security and to contribute to the
deepening of the dialogue and understanding in our country on these issues. A written
report will be presented to government within a year of the launch.

In its report, the Defence Commission outlined the deteriorating security situation in
Europe, particularly in light of the Russian aggression against Ukraine. Since the report,
developments in the region have continued to worsen. The Defence Commission
proposed a number of measures/actions for the Swedish Armed Forces. These included
amongst others: a new system for the basic training of squad leaders, soldiers and
sailors; upgrades of air defence capabilities; a reorganisation of the land forces into two
mechanised brigades; increased presence in the Baltic Sea and on the island of Gotland;
increased quality of home guard units; efforts to reinvigorate civil defence; a modern
psychological defence; enhanced cyber capabilities and long range precision strike
capability.

The defence bill now presented to parliament, states that the Swedish Armed Forces,
with other parts of the Swedish society, alongside political, diplomatic and economic
means, constitutes a threshold against armed attack, or the use of military force to exert
pressure on Sweden. A credible military capability to defend against armed aggression
contributes to a peace and our political freedom. Our security policy also requires a


-----

## 2015 06 01

defence force that is able to work alongside others. The Swedish Declaration of
Solidarity requires that we must be able to provide as well as receive support, civilian
and militarily.

Through its geographical position in the Baltic Sea, the island of Gotland is of a vital
strategic importance for Sweden, as well as for the Baltic Sea region as a whole. Gotland
is important for sea lanes and air routes to and from the Baltic States. It is a Swedish
strategic interest to have a permanent military presence on the island. A Swedish
military presence in and around Gotland will have a stabilising effect for the entire
region.

Swedish Defence Policy for the years 2016 to 2020 must be based upon the declining
security environment in Europe. In line with the Defence Commissions conclusions,
Swedish defence policy requires a new focus. Thus, a renewed regional focus will be a
priority, with the emphasis on national defence and planning for wartime scenarios. This
renewed regional and national focus will also require an updated Total Defence Concept
able to cope with present day challenges and threats. Ultimately, the Swedish Defence
should be able, with its available resources, to face an armed attack. The policies
proposed cannot, however, be viewed in isolation, but must be considered in a wider
Baltic Sea, European and global context.

### Enhancing the operational capability of the Armed Forces
The defence budget for the years 2016 to 2020, will be based on the June 2014
announcement of budgetary increases, amounting to approximately 7 billion SEK
(Government Resolution 12 and 15). The announced increase was based on the Defence
Commissions analysis.

The Swedish Armed Forces have suggested some reallocations of the announced
funding for the period of 2016-2020. These suggestions are included in the funding for
the period. This includes a reallocation of 1.3 billion SEK from the funding of
international missions to the funding of training and readiness.

An increased defence budget is fundamental, particularly in light of the deteriorating
security situation, but also to address the need to increase warfighting capabilities of
the Swedish Armed Forces. To that extent, the political agreement means that this
defence bill will add approximately 10 billion SEK extra to the Armed Forces the period
of 2016-2020 in addition to the previously announced increases. This means that the
budget of the Armed Forces will receive approximately 17 billion SEK extra compared to
the previous period. Thus, this defence bill sets a new trend in Swedish defence
spending. For the first time in more than two decades, the Swedish government has
decided on a substantial increase of the defence budget. Total defence spending over
the next five years will be 224 billion SEK.

1. Including previously announced increases and inflation adjustments
2. Additional funding for the respective years is presented in current prices and will,

once included in the Defence appropriation, be subject to inflation adjustments.

The additional funding will mitigate the financial costs of tax changes regarding the
employment of young persons as well as increased costs for infrastructure. These costs
are expected to be approximately 1.7 billion SEK for the period.

The budgetary increases will allow for reinforcements, such as:

-  A renewed regional focus, emphasising national defence and planning for
wartime scenarios.

-  Substantial investment in the basics of the defence force such as personal
equipment for our soldiers, communication/CIS equipment, radar systems,
trucks, and other materiel and logistics for the Armed Forces. Other priorities
include increased training and exercises.

-  An additional motorised battalion.

-  The re-establishment of permanently based regular army units on the island of
Gotland, including a mechanised company, an armoured company and command
and control components.

-  Upgraded main battle tanks and infantry combat vehicles, and new selfpropelled mortars for the mechanised battalions.

-  Additional bridge layers.

-  New anti-tank weapons.

-  Providing the Home Guard with four mortar platoons.

-  Upgrading two Gävle-class corvettes.

-  Air defence capabilities, including further investments in JAS39 with Meteor, as
well as new short and medium range surface to air missiles.

-  An additional reinforcement of anti-submarine warfare capability.

-  Investments in recruiting and the sustainment of soldiers.

-  A renewed civil defence.

-  Active cyber capabilities

### The Total Defence Concept
The security situation, in Europe as well as globally, has deteriorated over the past few
years. Therefore, the need for a Total Defence is once more evident. The Swedish Total


-----

## 2015 06 01

Defence consists of military defence as well as civil defence. Thus, the Total Defence
should be based on common planning guidelines, from the government to appropriate
authorities.

The need for psychological defence adapted to present day conditions has also been
identified. Psychological defence seeks to maintain our open and democratic society
with freedom of expression even during extraordinary conditions. It must apply to
peacetime conditions as well as in case of a raised alert, and ultimately during war. The
objective is to uphold our fundamental values. This will improve the ability of Swedish
society to withstand pressure from a potential opponent.

Hybrid warfare and propaganda represents a wide range of activities that can be used in
peace and in war. Sweden must be able to identify and meet such threats as well as to
be able to counter propaganda campaigns.

Cyber defence capabilities are an important part of the Swedish Defence. Vital systems
must be protected from attack. This also requires the ability to carry out active
operations in the cyber domain.

In order for Sweden to respond to changes in our security environment and to be able
to pursue an independent foreign and defence policy, we must have a strong
intelligence capability.

The Swedish Defence Intelligence Authorities consists of the Swedish Armed Forces, the
National Defence Radio Establishment, the Defence Materiel Administration and the
National Defence Research Agency. The deterioration of the security situation clearly
highlights the need of a strong Swedish capability to collect, process, analyse and
produce intelligence. The capabilities of Swedish Defence Intelligence will be reinforced.

With its local focus, the Home Guard is important for the capability of the Swedish
Defence as well as for popular support of the Armed Forces. The voluntary defence
organisations provide important resources both for the Total Defence concept as well as
for the ability to cope with peacetime crises. The voluntary defence organisations also
provide necessary skills and expertise and they have the opportunity to contribute to
the Total Defence concept, and hence, contingency measures.

**_Military Defence_**
The Swedish Armed Forces should on their own as well as together with our partners,
both within and outside Swedish territory, be able to defend Swedish security. This will
be done by:

-  asserting Swedish sovereignty and protecting our sovereign rights and our
national interests;


-----

## 2015 06 01

-  preventing and managing conflicts and wars, by protecting Sweden's freedom of
action from the political, military or other types of pressure and, if required
defend Sweden against incidents and armed aggression; and,

-  protecting society and its functionality by supporting civil authorities.

The main task of the Swedish Armed Forces is explicitly to maintain availability of
capabilities in peace and maintain readiness for a raised alert or war. This is essential to
prevent conflicts, and to protect Sweden's freedom of action against political, military or
other kinds of pressure. Ultimately, it is needed to protect Sweden against an armed
attack.

The Armed Forces shall promote our security; protect sovereign rights and national
interests on our territory, as well as in our region. The Armed Forces will assert
Sweden's territorial integrity by monitoring the territory to detect and reject violations.
Furthermore, the Armed Forces shall protect Swedish sovereign rights and national
interests outside Swedish territory in accordance with international law. The Armed
Forces should be able to monitor sea areas and airspace in the regional vicinity.

In addition, the Armed Forces will assist other agencies and civil society as needed. The
Armed Forces will provide this support with existing capabilities and resources. The
Armed Forces will not be designed or organised for the task of providing support to
civilian authorities in for the management of serious accidents and peacetime
emergencies. This does not exclude, however that particular actions, such as preplanning and training can be done in order to maintain a high degree of readiness to act
with the available resources. The Armed Forces should to a larger extent be able to
provide support to the rest of society.

Taken together, these tasks set the ambition for the capabilities of the Swedish Armed
Forces. The Armed Forces should be able to perform its tasks on their own as well as
together with other agencies, countries and organisations.

A long-term study will be commissioned to evaluate the overall procurement of materiel
and logistics, in addition to the measures taken related to the investment planning for
the Armed Forces.

**_Civil Defence_**
Planning for the civil defence should be resumed and implemented. Civil defence
should, with existing resources, initially prioritise the ability to support the Armed
Forces during raised alert or war.

The civil defence consists of tasks that make it possible for society to function in a
situation of raised alert. Thus, civil defence is not an organisation. Its tasks are being
performed by government agencies, municipal authorities, county councils, private
companies and Non-Governmental Organisations (NGOs). The primary tasks concern the


-----

## 2015 06 01

protection of the population, ensuring critical societal functions and to support the
Armed Forces. The total defence therefore requires a broad commitment and support in
the community.

The civil defence should:

-  protect the civilian population,

-  ensure the most important societal functions and,

-  contribute to the ability of the Armed Forces in an armed attack.

### Military Units

All parts of the Armed Forces that have assigned tasks during a raised status of alert or
in war will be organised as units and will be included in the order-of-battle of the Armed
Forces

The single and most important goal in the upcoming defence bill is to increase the
operational warfighting capability of the military units and the overall operational
capability of the Swedish total defence. This requires that the capabilities are ready to
be used in peacetime as well as in raised alert and war. The defence will be used in
peace, crisis and war.

Military units that are organised and prepared to face an armed attack will serve as the
basis for solving tasks in peacetime, such as safeguarding territorial integrity and the
participation in international crisis management operations. Such units must be
manned, equipped and trained. All units will have duties in peace time, as well as in
times of raised alert or war. The ability of the units to maintain their warfighting
capability is fundamental. Maintaining their warfighting capability refers to how well the
military units as a whole can solve their tasks immediately after mobilisation in the case
of a raised status of alert. Contingency requirements mean that all units with their
existing war fighting capability should be able to mobilize within a week after a decision
of to raise the status of alert.

All parts of the Armed Forces that have assigned tasks during a raised alert or in war will
be organised as units and will be included in the order-of-battle of the Armed Forces. All
units will be given operational requirements regarding their warfighting capabilities. The
order-of-battle of the Swedish Armed Forces consists of standing units, reserve units
and units in the Home Guard. In addition to the order-of-battle there is a pool of
personnel and equipment roughly equivalent to four mechanised battalions with no
assigned readiness but with the ability to be activated within three years of a
governmental decision and depending on additional funding. An additional pool of
personnel is also being maintained. Swedish units should be able to fight in Swedish
climate conditions including winter conditions. No units or garrisons will be disbanded.


-----

## 2015 06 01

In order to quickly reinforce the Swedish Defence it is necessary to implement measures
to improve the preconditions for the units to fulfil their requirements. Planning for
mobilisation of the entire force as well as mobilisation exercises will be conducted, as
well as controls and exercises in order to improve the readiness of units. Exercises and
controls are essential in order to identify and rectify flaws in the system affecting the
efficiency as well as the capacity to mobilize the full force of the Swedish Armed Forces.

### Special priorities
_Basic requirements_
In order to increase the warfighting capabilities of the units, special priority is to be
given to addressing the basic requirements of the units in areas such as such as personal
equipment, communications equipment, ammunition, trucks, new anti-tank weapons
and so on.  Training and exercises will increase substantially in order to provide
advanced joint exercises as well as to exercise all units in their wartime tasks during the
period of 2016-2020. These investments are necessary to increase the warfighting
capabilities of the Armed Forces.

_Reinforcements of the Defences of Gotland_
A Battlegroup Gotland will be organised in 2018. The Battlegroup will consist of a
standing Mechanised Infantry Company and a reserve Armoured Company. In addition
the Light Infantry Battalion will be reorganised to be able to be transported by air,
allowing it to rapidly reinforce strategic areas including Gotland. Regional Command and
Control assets for Gotland is being organised within existing Command and Control
structures. The Home Guard on the island will be reinforced. It is important that
frequent exercises with air defence assets on Gotland will be conducted and training
and exercises will increase on and around the island.

_Anti-submarine capabilities_
Anti-submarine capabilities are important in order to, amongst others, maintain
Swedish territorial integrity. A number of measures will be taken to strengthen these
capabilities as soon as possible. Increased training and exercises as well as a greater
redundancy in ship crews will increase anti-submarine capabilities. The five Visby-class
corvettes will be joined by two Gävle-class corvettes that will undergo midlife upgrades
providing them with anti-submarine capabilities including sensors and command and
control systems. Seven smaller patrol boats will be modified, including with antisubmarine weapons, and four will be rebuilt into buoy-monitoring boats, thus increasing
the number of anti-submarine platforms compared to previous planning. New mobile
sensors will be taken into service and mine-systems will be kept operational to ensure
sensor functionality of anti-submarine capabilities.

## 2015 06 01

### The development of the services 
_Land Forces_
The bulk of the land forces will be organised in two Brigades able to fight a highintensity conflict against a qualified opponent. The land forces will be expanded with
one Motorised Battalion, two Brigade Reconnaissance Companies and the Mechanised
Battlegroup Gotland. The Light Infantry Battalion will be reorganised in order to be
transportable by air. The land forces will primarily be manned by reserves
complemented by personnel serving under the law of national service. To ensure
sufficient availability in peace-time, two Mechanised Battalions and one Motorised
Infantry Battalion will be standing units with a high number of professional personnel.

The land forces will consist of two Brigade Headquarters, two Brigade Reconnaissance
Companies, five Mechanised Battalions, two Motorised Battalions, one Light Infantry
Battalion, one Mechanised Battlegroup Gotland, two Artillery Battalions, two Air
Defence Battalions, two Engineer Battalions, One Ranger Battalion, one ISR Battalion,
one Security Battalion, one MP Battalion, one Life Guards Battalion, one CBRN
Company, one Heavy Transport Company and 40 Home Guard Battalions.

During the period, the land forces will receive equipment on the personal- squad- and
platoon-level, trucks, artillery, self-propelled mortars, additional bridge-layers, anti-tank
weapons, new ground based short-range air defence systems and additional
ammunitions. Upgrades of combat vehicles 90 and main battle tanks with their
designated command and control will be initiated for the main part of the mechanised
units. A new ground based medium range air defence system will be acquired for one of
the two Air Defence Battalions. The other Battalion will receive the new system after
the period. All main battle tanks will be brought into service in the mechanised
battalions and the Battlegroup Gotland. This reorganisation will significantly increase
the number of main battle tanks in the units compared to the present organisation.

The Home Guard provides a large and important part of the land Forces. With their
availability, their numbers and their geographical positions they are of vital importance
for the defence of the Swedish territory, including the protection of base areas for the
naval and air forces as well as for protection of critical infrastructure and other
important objects. The Home Guard will receive increased capabilities including the
addition of four mortar platoons and battalion level command and control assets.

_Naval Forces_
The core of the naval units consists of seven corvettes, four submarines and seven mineclearance vessels. In the period the naval forces will maintain five Visby-class corvettes,
five Koster-class mine-clearance vessels, two Spårö-class mine-clearance diver vessels,
one Gotland-class as well as one Södermanland-class submarine. Midlife upgrades will
be done on two Gävle-class corvettes and two Gotland-class submarines. Service life
extension will be done on seven patrol boats, four patrol boats will be refitted as sonar


-----

## 2015 06 01

buoy boats and two Stockholm-class corvettes will be refitted as patrol ships. During the
period, acquisition of a new anti-ship missile as well as a new light torpedo will begin. It
is especially important that the sea version of the Helicopter 14 system will become
operational. An increase in the number of crews as well as increased training and
exercise will allow for more sustainability and more time at sea for the naval ships.
Support from the Armed Forces to the National Defence Radio Establishment with
strategic SIGINT will be maintained by the acquisition of a new SIGINT vessel.

It is important that the capability and availability of the naval forces are upheld even
during periods with high needs of materiel overhauls. The Amphibious Battalion will be
focused on its maritime tasks. Construction of two new submarines will begin in the
period.

The naval forces will consist of two Surface Warfare Flotilla Staffs, two Corvette
Squadrons, two Mine-clearance Squadrons, two Support Squadrons, one Mineclearance Diver Squadron, and one Submarine Flotilla staff, one Submarine Squadron,
one Amphibious Battalion, one Patrol Boat Company and one Naval Base.

_Air Forces_
The air forces will consist of four Air Wings with six Fighter Squadrons (JAS 39C/D), one
Air Transport Squadron, one Air Combat Control and Air Surveillance Battalion and one
Helicopter Wing. The peacetime fighter training establishment will be reorganised to be
able to serve alongside the other fighter squadrons in case of war, bringing the number
of fighter squadrons to six. An adjustment of the number of fighter squadrons due to
the future introduction of JAS 39 E will be considered in the future and is dependent on
the possible decision to acquire an additional ten JAS 39 E fighters. Such a
reorganisation will only be considered once the existing number of fighter aircraft
merits a reduced number of squadrons. The capability to disperse the fighter squadrons
within their regular bases as well as between alternate bases will be improved.

The Defence Commission suggested that the number of JAS 39E should increase from
previously planned 60 to 70. Final delivery of the 60 JAS 39E will take place in the mid2020s. The increase to 70 aircraft is dependent on a new decision to acquire these
aircraft. Such a decision can wait until a later time. The availability of the fighter aircraft
over an extended period of time is of special importance. The availability should allow
for an increase in total flight hours, in turn contributing to the safe-guarding of air
combat capabilities during the rearmament from JAS 39C/D to JAS 39 E.

Parts of the peacetime establishment of the air forces have previously not been
organised as units with task in case of a raised alert or war. Thus the air forces will be
reorganised into four Air Wings providing a high availability in peace as well as a high
readiness in case of raised alert or war. The Air Wings maintain ground based services in
peace and war and are responsible for dispersal, including to alternative bases. The Four
Air Wings allow a flexible use of existing air bases. Investments in the bases will provide

10


-----

## 2015 06 01

increased opportunities to disperse. This will increase the survivability of the air forces
in case of war.

Existing tactical air transport aircraft (TP-84) will be maintained during the period. The
Swedish Armed Forces are studying the possibilities of future acquisition of new tactical
air transport aircraft.

The Helicopter Wing will operate three types of modern helicopters. The Helicopter
units will give special attention to supporting the naval forces with anti-submarine
capabilities as well as to supporting the land forces with tactical transport. The support
to the Police authorities will continue.

_Joint Forces_
The new focus on preparing to face an armed attack will gave considerable impact on
for the joint forces, not least in the areas of logistics and command and control. The
focus of the land Forces on high intensity warfighting at the Brigade level means that
the logistics and command and control units should be adjusted accordingly. Parts of the
joint logistics and the command and control units will be transferred to the land forces
in case of activation or mobilisation in order to perform tactical tasks within the
Brigades.

The joint forces will consist of the following units, one Armed Forces Headquarters, four
Regional Headquarters, one Communications Battalion, one Command and Control
Battalion, one Electronic Warfare Battalion, one Armed Forces Logistics (FMLOG), two
Logistics Battalions, one Technical Battalion, one Movement Control Company, two
Medical Hospital Companies, two Medical Support Companies, one Special Operations
Group and 19 Depot Units.

All parts of the Armed Forces peacetime establishment with tasks to perform in case of
raised alter or war will be organised as units. Depot units are organised throughout the
country to provide support on local level and to support the activation or mobilisation of
the full force. These Depot Units will also provide complementary training of the other
units. All personnel working at the peacetime establishment but not assigned to other
units will have an assignment at the Depot unit. All parts of the peacetime
establishment and all employed personnel with tasks during raised alert or war will thus
be organised for war service.

#### Long-term defence material procurement
The Defence commissions proposed the acquisition of another10 JAS 39E, in addition to
the 60 JAS 39 E that are currently planned for. The Defence commission also
recommended procuring a third new submarine as well as a long-range precision strike
missile. A decision on these recommendations will be taken in the early 2020s.

11


-----

## 2015 06 01

The Armed Forces presented a list of priorities of necessary procurement actions. This
list was included in the previous procurement plan, but subsequent decisions on
procurement or funding have not yet been taken for all items according to the plan and
timetable of June 2014. Several of these measures dealt with upgrades and
enhancements of existing defence equipment. As already noted, the operational war
fighting capability of the Swedish Armed Forces, during the period 2016-2020, must be
prioritized. While some of these measures do not directly increase the operational
capacity in the period 2016-2020, it may still be of great importance for the Swedish
Armed Forces' overall capability during the 2020s:

-  lifetime extension of the corvette Gävle Class from the mid-2020s to 2030,

-  the acquisition of new transportation boats to the Home Guard units,

-  integration and acquisition of light torpedo on the helicopter 14,

-  upgrade of the fixed sensor chain, and,

-  new radio equipment to the Home Guard units.

In addition, there is a need for additional procurements and/or upgrades and
enhancements in the period from 2021 such as:

-  training aircraft,

-  combat vehicles,

-  transport aircraft,

-  minesweeping vessels,

-  fixed telecommunications networks, and

-  anti-ship missiles.

The above-mentioned procurement challenges must be managed in order to ensure the
operational capacity in the long-term. There is a need to assess and ensure that there is
an overall strategic balance and prioritisation of necessary defence equipment
procurements from 2021. Therefore, this defence bill will set up a study, to assess and
develop a procurement plan for defence equipment. This study will focus on finding
ways to increase the operational war fighting capability by prioritising necessary
procurements beyond 2020. The study shall also take into account the current defence
procurement plan. The study will be completed by 2018 and thus form a basis for the
government and the Defence Commission’s continued work ahead of the defence bill
for the period after 2021.

#### Recruitment and retention of soldiers
Recruitment and retention of soldiers and personnel, in order to man all units, are vital
factors for maintaining Sweden’s defence and security needs. The entire Swedish
society has a role to play when it comes to the Total Defence of Sweden. Overall societal
support is ultimately of crucial importance for Sweden's defence capabilities. This
support is primarily achieved through the involvement and commitment of the Swedish
population. The manning of soldiers and indeed all personnel of the Armed Forces plays

12


-----

## 2015 06 01

an important role in engaging participation among the Swedish population. The Swedish
Armed Forces needs extensive support from the whole society in its task to defend the
country.

The Swedish Armed Forces military units are to consist of two types of personnel
categories: full-time personnel, (professional officers and squad leaders, soldiers and
sailors – labelled as GSS/K) and reserve personnel (reserve officers and squad leaders,
soldiers and sailors – labelled as GSS/T). However, in addition, there are squad leaders,
soldiers and sailors who do not have an employment with the Armed Forces, but are
obliged by law to compulsory service in a unit in case of raised alert or war. These
individuals have previously been conscripts or are former employees of the Armed
Forces. In war, there will also be civilian employees of the Armed Forces obliged by law
to serve in the units.

Recruitment and staffing of full-time personnel is working according to the Armed
Forces planning, though early dropouts are cause for concern. However, recruitment of
reserve squad leaders, soldiers and sailors (GSS/T) have proved to be problematic. A
significant portion of the positions in units in this category is still staffed by the old
recruitment conscription system. It is important that efforts to recruit GSS/T continue.

The dependence of conscripted personnel in order to fully man all units will remain
throughout and beyond the period of 2016-2020. Thus, there is in practice a third
category of personnel serving in case of raised alert or war. Taking note of this fact, this
bill introduces a new personnel category consisting of squad leaders, soldiers and sailors
that are not currently employed by the Armed Forces but who have either been
conscripts or formerly been employed by the Armed Forces. This category is called
GSS/P.

The basic military training will be changed in order to allow individuals who have
completed basic training, to be assigned to a unit immediately after the training. Basic
training should comprise 9-12 months (4-7 months for the Home Guard).

A well-functioning system for reserve officers is important. This system will be used to
fill positions that primarily require service in rehearsal exercises and when a unit is
activated or mobilized. Reserve officers, like other reserve personnel, are a cost
effective way to man the Armed Forces. The guiding principle for the reserve system
should be the warfighting needs of the units. Initial training of tactical reserve officers
shall be conducted through in-house training and education for those who already have
or will acquire a civilian academic degree. This is the most cost efficient way to quickly
strengthen the reserve system. This training should begin as soon as possible.

There are, however, challenges in the recruitment and retention of personnel, which
means that there is a continuous need for reform. The recruitment and retention of
personnel should be analysed furthered. A study will be commissioned to suggest a

13


-----

## 2015 06 01

sustainable manning system serving the needs of the Swedish total defence. This study
shall include an analysis of the Danish and Norwegian systems, combining both a
voluntary as well as a conscript system.

Our veteran policy aims to provide personnel serving in international missions and their
families support and assistance proportionate to the risks and stresses to which they are
exposed. The Veterans Inquiry report, (SOU 2014: 27), submitted a number of proposals
concerning the development of Swedish veteran policy. There is a strong and popular
support for our veterans. It is necessary that we shoulder responsibility for our veterans.
The report was presented during the first half of 2015. The government is currently
studying how the commission's proposals can be implemented.
