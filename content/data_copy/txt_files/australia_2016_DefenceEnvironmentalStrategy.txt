The Defence Environmental Strategy informs and
provides guidance to a range of Group and
Service strategic documents designed to enable
Defence capability.

The Defence Environmental Policy, Strategy and Plan
are supported by a range of subordinate environmental


strategies, programs, plans, systems and procedures.
These have been developed and implemented by
Defence Groups and Services to cover specific
activities and environmental issues.


###### Alignment with both Australian government direction and Defence- wide strategic guidance and corporate planning is provided through enterprise-level documents such as the Defence White Paper and Defence Corporate Plan. The Defence Environmental Policy, Strategy and Plan form an environmental management framework to support Defence strategic direction. 

Environmental management underpins and
directly contributes to key elements of the Defence
White Paper, including capability acquisitions,
estate consolidation, training area availability and
joint operations. Environmental compliance and
performance is further endorsed as a critical control

 20 years


###### Key challenges

Key challenges include:

–– greater and more varied environmental impact
profiles due to increased operational tempo,
increased involvement of foreign military forces,
and larger activity footprints;

–– uncertainty in military training requirements
competing with environmental management
obligations;

–– encroachment from urban development and
adjacent private land use, and growing public
expectations regarding environmental outcomes;

–– climate change pressure on Defence activities,
personnel, built and natural assets in Australia
through sea level rise and more extreme
weather events;

–– countries in Australia’s immediate region
will be challenged by the impacts of climate
change combining with existing challenges
around population growth and environmental
degredation; and

–– continuing to be a leader in responding to
regional requirements for humanitarian and
disaster relief.


###### Defence operates in an uncertain and constantly changing strategic context. Over the next 20 years, Defence will face a range of opportunities and challenges, including some that are environmental in nature and others that require an environmental management response.

Many of the opportunities and challenges are obvious
now, some are emerging and others will not be
identified for many years. Given this context, Defence
must identify and address the opportunities and
challenges in a proactive and informed manner to
adapt or evolve as the need arises.

The following opportunities and challenges are current
or emerging, and will continually evolve over the life of
this strategy.


###### Key opportunities

Key opportunities include:

–– using Defence size and experience to drive
resource efficiency in collaboration with industry
and other service providers;

–– pursuing closer collaboration with other
Commonwealth agencies, Defence trilateral
partners and industry to share innovation and
lessons learned and implement best practice;

–– building on positive experiences and
achievements to maintain strong relationships
with the community and regulators;

–– empowering Defence personnel to actively
contribute to improving Defence environmental
performance;

–– promoting risk-based approaches with
demonstrated environmental and economic
benefits to drive efficiency; and

–– capitalising on the introduction of new estate
and operational tools and approaches to
improve environmental management and
monitoring.

**Strategic aim 1: Defence will deliver a**
**sustainable estate across Defence maritime,**
**land and aerospace areas, activities and**
**operations.**

**Strategic aim 2: Defence will understand and**
**manage its environmental impacts.**

**Strategic aim 3: Defence will minimise**
**future pollution risks and manage existing**
**contamination risks.**

**Strategic aim 4: Defence will improve the**
**efficiency of its resource consumption and**
**strengthen resource security.**

**Strategic aim 5: Defence will recognise and**
**manage the Defence estate heritage values.**


The following sections provide greater details on the
context and priorities for each strategic aim.

Defence Groups and Services have already developed
thematic strategies, programs, tools and systems
to manage environmental factors such as water,
energy, biodiversity, pollution, contamination and
heritage. The Defence Environmental Strategy and
Plan do not replace these, but instead provide the
overarching direction, priorities and actions for Defence
environmental management.


-----

-----

### Strategic aim 1:


#### Defence will deliver a sustainable estate across Defence maritime, land and aerospace areas, activities and operations


##### Priorities

To achieve this strategic aim, Defence will:

**1.1 meet its environmental stewardship and legislative**
obligations with respect to natural values, across
its activities;

**1.2 train in a sustainable manner to ensure ongoing**
and reliable access to facilities and training areas
of the required training quality;

**1.3 minimise and manage adverse consequences**
(e.g. from bushfire and biosecurity risks) for
external parties (communities, businesses and
adjacent landholders) as a result of Defence
activities;

**1.4 manage current and future risks associated with**
natural hazards and climate change;

**1.5 manage biosecurity risks when operating and**
training in Australia and overseas; and

**1.6 build strategic partnerships to identify innovative**
and more efficient ways to enhance sustainability
outcomes.

The Defence Environmental Plan details strategic
actions, accountabilities and timeframes to support the
achievement of these priorities.


###### This strategic aim covers biodiversity conservation, biosecurity, feral animals, weeds, overabundant species, bushfire management, soil conservation, climate change and disaster management. 


##### Context

Defence is one of the largest landholders in Australia
and has the responsibility to sustainably manage
vast tracts of diverse and geographically dispersed
maritime, land and aerospace areas. These areas are a
fundamental input into Defence capability, supporting
facilities, training areas and training activities. They also
are a significant national asset, comprising important
environmental values and ecological systems. As the
custodian of the environment upon which it operates,
Defence is committed to responsibly managing
its natural assets and meeting its environmental
obligations.

Defence land, maritime and aerospace areas allow
Defence to train in environments that mirror as
closely as possible the range of potential operational
environments it may encounter when deployed.
Defence capability relies on consistent access to
specific training areas and facilities, many of which
would not be possible to replace. Defence aims to
manage an environmentally sustainable estate through
a proactive, risk-based approach to sustainable
environmental management.


-----

-----

### Strategic aim 2:


#### Defence will understand and manage its environmental impacts


##### Priorities

To achieve this strategic aim, Defence will:

**2.1 manage its activities to meet its environmental**
and heritage legislative obligations;

**2.2** maintain positive and proactive relationships
with environmental regulators and other key
stakeholder groups; and

**2.3 improve the consistent application and ownership**
of the environmental impact assessment process
across Defence Groups and Services.

The Defence Environmental Plan details strategic
actions, accountabilities and timeframes to support the
achievement of these priorities.


###### This strategic aim covers environmental impact assessment and approval.


##### Context

Defence is required to meet the obligations of the
_Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation_
_Act 1999 (EPBC Act) in the conduct of activities which_
have potential environmental impacts. The EPBC Act
sets thresholds for environmental assessment and
approval based on the potential for an activity to have
a significant impact on the environment or matters of
national environmental significance.

The process for assessing environmental impacts and
developing mitigation measures under the EPBC Act
framework has been continually improved. This enables
the efficient management of environmental risks through
a consistent and robust process that provides Defence
with the flexibility to train when, where and how it needs
to train to achieve optimal preparedness.

Under this process, planning starts as early as possible
to develop a preliminary concept of a proposed activity,
its timing, location, potential environmental issues
and required capability outcome. Establishing a plan
early is critical, as it allows Defence to tailor a costeffective approach by narrowing the focus to key issues,
gathering the right data and consulting key stakeholders
where required. Through the ongoing refinement of this
process, Defence is able to identify the most important
risks early, allowing planners to factor environmental
matters into their activities, and enabling sensible and
cost-efficient mitigation measures to be developed.

### Strategic aim 3:


##### Priorities

To achieve this strategic aim, Defence will:

**3.1 minimise future pollution and contamination risks**
both in Australia and overseas operations;

**3.2 understand emerging contamination risks and**
advances in remediation and management
approaches;

**3.3 apply a risk-based approach to managing**
contaminated sites, including unexploded
ordnance, to reduce impacts on human health
and the natural environment and maintain public
access to key information about these risk; and

**3.4 manage contaminated sites and potential**
pollutants in accordance with relevant legislative
obligations and standards.

The Defence Environmental Plan details strategic
actions, accountabilities and timeframes to support the
achievement of these priorities.


#### Defence will minimise future pollution risks and manage existing contamination risks 


###### This strategic aim covers pollution prevention, contamination management and site remediation. 


##### Context

There is a wide range of potential pollution sources
across the complex and varied life cycle and
geographies of Defence activities, each with varying
hazards to human health and the natural environment.

Understanding pollution sources, their potential
pathways to people and the natural environment,
the environmental implications of Defence activities,
and the most efficient and effective way to avoid or
eliminate this risk is a strategic priority for Defence.

Defence manages a large number of contaminated
sites as a legacy of past industrial and military activities
and practices. Contamination of soil, water and air
has the potential to cause harmful effects on human
and environmental health, reduce land capability
for Defence purposes, create large contingent
cost liabilities, and breach legislative obligations.
Management of Defence activities by proactively
eliminating, substituting or controlling sources of
pollution, and achieving legislative compliance, will
minimise the occurrence of these issues.

Where legacy contamination issues are identified,
Defence is committed to investigating the nature,
extent and consequences of contamination, and
developing cost-effective, risk-based management
responses.

Effective management of pollution will enable Defence
to avoid creating future contamination issues, while
improving health and safety performance, capability,
environmental quality and reputation.

### Strategic aim 4:


#### Defence will improve the efficiency of its resource consumption and strengthen resource security  


##### Priorities

To achieve this strategic aim, Defence will:

**4.1 minimise operational costs by using less energy**
and water;

**4.2 transition toward cleaner energy and integrated**
water management (with greater use of fit-forpurpose water);

**4.3  improve monitoring of energy and water to**
meet government reporting requirements and
drive further reduction in energy and water
consumption;

**4.4 obtain a robust understanding of its energy and**
water consumption to meet to critical capability
needs;

**4.5 improve waste disposal options and product**
stewardship (reducing the impacts throughout the
product lifecycle); and

**4.6 drive behavioural change in relation to energy and**
water consumption, waste disposal and product
stewardship.

The Defence Environmental Plan details strategic
actions, accountabilities and timeframes to support the
achievement of these priorities.


###### This strategic aim covers energy efficiency, ecologically sustainable development, sustainable procurement, waste minimisation and water management. 


##### Context

Having a reliable and continuous supply of energy and
water is critical to sustaining Defence capability. Energy
and water are integral to most Defence activities, from
powering aircraft, ships and vehicles to sustaining
accommodation, offices and personnel.

Defence is the largest consumer of energy and water
and the largest generator of waste within the Australian
Government. Defence aims to improve energy and
water efficiency and minimise waste generation. Due to
its size, even modest improvements made by Defence
can deliver substantial cost savings and environmental
outcomes.

Since the mid-2000s, Defence has measured energy
and water consumption at an estate level and
implemented initiatives to reduce consumption on a
return-on-investment basis. Efficiency in energy, water
and waste management, coupled with forward-looking
management of key supply assets, will ensure that
Defence has a secure and continuous supply of critical
resources well into the future.

### Strategic aim 5:


#### Defence will recognise and manage the Defence estate heritage values 


##### Priorities

To achieve this strategic aim, Defence will:

**5.1 comply with legal requirements for management**
of indigenous, historic and natural heritage;

**5.2 continue to learn from and improve its**
engagement with local communities;

**5.3 continue to seek opportunities to adaptively re-**
use heritage buildings where this can provide a
safe and efficient facilities solution;

**5.4 increase understanding of the heritage values on**
the defence estate; and

**5.5 further build and maintain relationships with**
government, heritage organisations, and other
custodians of large heritage portfolios.

The Defence Environmental Plan details strategic
actions, accountabilities and timeframes to support
the achievement of these priorities.


###### This strategic aim covers heritage management.


##### Context

Defence has a long and proud history of valuing
its heritage places, including the important military
traditions and culture that these values represent.
Although the estate is managed primarily for military
purposes, Defence manages its heritage values
consistent with heritage obligations of the EPBC Act.
This includes maintaining a current understanding of
the heritage values across the Defence estate and
acknowledging, managing and preserving these values
where appropriate.

The Defence estate and other areas where Defence
conducts its activities contain significant indigenous,
historic and natural values. This includes places rich
in nationally and internationally significant biodiversity;
buildings, items and places of military historical
importance; and sites of significant importance to
indigenous Australians.

Defence identifies and manages heritage risks
through a range of activities at all life-cycle stages,
incorporating heritage considerations into planning
for training, operations, property redevelopments,
maintenance and disposals and a range of other
activities.

The Defence Environmental Policy and Strategy set the
direction for sustainable environmental management
in the medium to long term (20 years) and will be
reviewed 5 yearly. The Defence Environmental Plan
is an operational document that has been developed
for a five year period from 2016 to 2020 inclusive,
with annual review. These reviews will inform potential
updates to the Defence Environmental Policy and
Environmental Strategy and inform the next five year
Environment Plan.

This approach enables Defence to ensure continual
improvement in the approach to achieving the vision.


Each environmental action is supported by clear
accountabilities for implementation along with a
milestone for completion. A monitoring and reporting
framework centred on performance measures is
also presented in the plan.

A progress report on implementation will be developed
on an annual basis.
