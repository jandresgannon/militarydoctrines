##### Security Environment

###### ndia’s defence strategy and policies aim at providing a peaceful environment by addressing the wide spectrum of
## I
###### conventional and non-conventional security challenges faced by the country.


1.1 India's security environment is
defined by a complex interplay of regional
and global imperatives and challenges. The
size and the strategic location of the country
places us at the centre of a security dynamic
impacted concurrently by the positive forces
of regional and global connectivity on the
one side and also by adverse consequences
arising from unpredictability, instability and
volatility in parts of the immediate and
extended neighbourhood.

1.2 As India seeks to achieve
transformative national growth and
development at home, India’s defence
strategy and policies aim at providing a
peaceful environment by addressing the
wide spectrum of conventional and nonconventional security challenges faced by
the country. Guided by the principle of
building strength through the principles of
strategic autonomy and self reliance, India
seeks to enhance her own capabilities and
also to pursue a constructive engagement
with neighbours and partner countries in the
regional and global community to promote
peace and stability.

###### Global Security Environment

1.3 India’s geo-strategic location makes
it sensitive to developments beyond its
immediate neighbourhood, in West Asia,
Central Asia, in the Indian Ocean Region
and the Asia Pacific region. Major geopolitical and geo-economic developments


are currently transforming the global
security scenario into one of uncertainty and
volatility.

1.4 Since the end of the Cold War, the
global security environment has seen major
changes. On the one hand, the world has
witnessed a spurt of globalisation and
deepening economic interdependence,
which has enhanced the growth of countries
like India, China, Brazil and South Africa. On
the other, large parts of the world continue
to be affected by conflict and violence. The
global balance of power has witnessed new
adjustments and dynamics, with increased
multi-polarity generating new strategic
uncertainties, reflected often in competition
and contestation. The continuing economic
crisis in the West has been a major cause of
worry for the global economy and has had
consequent effects on the economies of other
regions.

1.5 Even as the probability of a full scale
conventional war is thought to have receded
since the end of the Cold War, a number of
drivers have catalysed new challenges in the
regional and global security landscape. The
intensifying competition for natural resources
adds an overlay of volatility to existing fault
lines of territorial disputes between nations
and poses a challenge to the norms of
international law and accepted standards of
international behaviour.

1.6 The transnational threats posed by
the activities of terrorist organizations have


-----

been exacerbated by the dynamics of intra
and inter State conflicts and pose a danger
to regions beyond the primary theatres. The
transnational mobilization of foot soldiers
and logistics support for terrorist activities
poses a serious internal security challenge for
countries around the world. Technological
advances in telecommunications and the
cyber domain have provided force multipliers
to boost the capabilities and impact of
terrorist activities. There is continuing
concern over terrorist threats emanating from
India's neighbourhood and the transnational
linkages through which such groups are
being sustained.

1.7 The prospects of peace and stability
in various regions of the world are marred
by the proliferation of weapons of mass
destruction. Piracy and other challenges to
maritime security also pose major threat to
regional and global peace and security. In
particular, the proliferation of WMD and
the threat of nuclear terrorism continue to
be major international security concerns,
notwithstanding international efforts to
strengthen nuclear security and to prevent
non-State actors from acquiring nuclear
materials.

1.8 The shift of the global balance of
power from the Euro-Atlantic region to the
Asia-Pacific region has brought a complex
and dynamic interplay of economic, military
and diplomatic factors, evidenced in the
escalation of maritime territorial disputes,
military postures and power rivalries, all
of which have added to the uncertainties
in the security situation in the region. The
contestations over island territories in the
Asia Pacific have created tensions in the
region and threaten to polarise the Asia


Pacific community. The situation on the
Korean peninsula is also fraught with tension
due to relation between North and South
Korea and with North Korea conducting its
third nuclear test. These developments have
affected the military balance and impacted
economic cooperation in the region.
Non-traditional challenges such as transnational crime, terrorism, natural disasters,
pandemics, cyber security and food and
energy security also pose serious challenges
to the region.

1.9 India has important political, economic,
commercial and social interests in the Asia
Pacific and has a stake in continued peace
and stability in the region. India supports
freedom of navigation in international waters
and the right of passage, in accordance with
International law. India’s view is that all
countries must exercise restraint and resolve
bilateral issues diplomatically, according to
principles of International law and without
recourse to the use or threat of use of force.
India is of the view that in the current
regional security landscape, there is a need
to promote a cooperative approach. Hence,
we remain actively engaged with the Asia
Pacific community through a web of bilateral
as well as multilateral fora like the East Asia
Summit, ADMM – Plus and ASEAN Regional
Forum (ARF), so as to contribute to peace
and stability in the region.

1.10 The Central Asian Region due its
location and resources, and in view of recent
developments in the Eurasia and West Asia,
continues to be of strategic significance.
India has been developing strong politicoeconomic and security partnerships with
all the Central Asian Republics, due to its
strategic significance. The region is also


-----

considered as a potential source for India’s
energy requirements and a key market for
our exports in the backdrop of efforts at
consolidation of Eurasian economic space
under EEU. The opening of new connectivity
corridors would create avenues for India to
access wide range of natural resources in the
region.

1.11 The situation in Ukraine has brought
to the forefront a fresh challenge to peace
and stability in the region and a prolonged
stand-off could have an adverse impact
on international security and the global
economy. India believes that there is scope
for a political and diplomatic solution to the
current problem.

1.12 Parts of the West Asian region
continue to face volatility and instability
in the wake of the changes brought about
by the Arab Spring. These changes have
ushered in fundamental political and socioeconomic transformation, in many parts of
the region. On the other side of the ledger, a
number of malevolent non-state actors have
mushroomed in the region. Sectarian faultlines have also deepened, thereby disturbing
the stability and internal cohesion of various
countries in the region. India has not only vital
stakes, but also has long standing relations
with the countries and people of this region.
Continuing unrest and uncertainty in West
Asia and Gulf region, which is part of India’s
extended neighborhood, has a major impact
on India’s diverse interests in the region in
terms of diaspora, trade, remittances, energy
and security. India remains engaged with
the countries in the region on defence and
security issues of common concern.

1.13 The evolving situation in Syria and
Iraq is of growing concern in terms of the


impact of ongoing developments on the
stability of these countries and repercussions
for other countries within and beyond the
region. The extension of the Syrian conflict
into Iraq has serious ramifications for the
region, with heightened extremist and
sectarian overtones. India has expressed deep
concern at the violence and loss of human
lives in Syria and has consistently called for
an inclusive and comprehensive political
solution which will take into account the
legitimate aspirations of the Syrian people.
India has also expressed firm support to Iraq
in its fight against international terrorism and
in its efforts to preserve its unity and territorial
integrity.

1.14 The tensions between Israel and
Palestine is also a matter of concern as it
threatens regional peace and security. India
supports a negotiated solution resulting in a
sovereign, independent, viable and united
State of Palestine, with East Jerusalem as its
capital, living within secure and recognized
borders, side by side at peace with Israel
as endorsed in the Quartet Roadmap and
relevant UNSC Resolutions.

1.15 Iran occupies an important place in
the economic and security calculus of India.
India has welcomed the interim nuclear
agreement between the E3+3 and Iran and
supports resolving all issues related to Iran’s
nuclear programme through a comprehensive
dialogue between the parties.

1.16 Many regions in Africa are witnessing
upheaval, as uprisings and insurgencies have
been sweeping across a number of North
and West African countries. Of particular
concern is the growing influence of terrorist
organizations in the region. While, the threat
from piracy in the Western Indian Ocean has


-----

diminished, the same has assumed serious
proportions in the Gulf of Guinea. A number
of Indian seafarers have been affected in acts
of piracy in the Gulf of Guinea. The activities
of terrorist outfits in Nigeria and other
countries is a threat to the internal stability
of these countries and the linkages between
these and other terrorist organisations outside
the region are a matter of serious concern.
India has historic ties with several African
nations and seeks to deepen its bonds with
them through the strategic initiative of the
India-Africa Forum Summit (IAFS) mechanism
that seeks to promote bilateral, regional and
continent-level political, economic and
strategic cooperation with African countries.

1.17 The Indian Ocean Region (IOR) is
vital to India’s security and prosperity. As
a maritime nation historically and by virtue
of its geo-physical configuration and geopolitical circumstances, India is dependent on
the oceans surrounding it. India’s peninsular
dimension in the Indian Ocean Region,
places it adjacent to the most vital sea-lanes
of the world, stretching from the Suez Canal
and the Persian Gulf to the Malacca Straits.
India’s security and prosperity is dependent
on these sea lanes and its ability to engage
freely in maritime trade and commerce.

###### The Regional Security Environment

1.18 A secure, stable, peaceful and
prosperous neighbourhood is central to
India's security calculus. The regional security
environment in South Asia continues to be
dynamic, with terrorism, insurgency and
sectarian conflict from our West and North,
increasingly threatening the stability of our
region. Amidst the ongoing efforts to impart
fresh vigour and dynamism to strengthening


relations with neighbours in a comprehensive
manner, the need for a cooperative security
construct is of immediate relevance in this
period of strategic uncertainty. India is
committed to build an open and dialoguebased security co-operation  with all partners
in the neighbourhood on the basis of equality,
mutual benefit and mutual respect.

1.19 As the international military forces
in Afghanistan approach the phase of
drawdown, the security situation in
Afghanistan requires close monitoring. With
the Afghan National Security Forces(ANSF)
taking full responsibility for the security of the
country, the international community must
ensure sustained support to the equipping
and capability building requirements of
the ANSF, to enable them to deal with the
entire spectrum of security challenges that
they may be required to face. The present
political transition in the country is a
significant milestone for Afghanistan with
renewed opportunities for an Afghan-led
and Afghan-owned national reconciliation
process. The Strategic Partnership Agreement
between India and Afghanistan provides
the framework for the commitment of both
countries to build the bilateral relationship in
all spheres, including through defence and


-----

security cooperation aimed at enhancing
mutual capacity in the fight against terrorism
and other security challenges.

1.20 Pakistan continues to remain home
to several Non-State actors with North
Western Frontier Province (NWFP) serving
as the fountainhead for terrorist activity in
the region. Pakistan’s quest for strategic
depth in Afghanistan continues to drive its
policy to support Taliban and its affiliates
in Afghanistan. The expanding footprints
of extremist and terrorist organisations in
Pakistan and their linkages with terrorist
activities in J&K and rest of India poses
a major security challenge to India, with
severe ramifications on bilateral relations,
as well as to the peace and security of the
region. The use of terrorism as an instrument
of state policy has deep roots in Pakistani
military establishment. Ceasefire violations
and infiltration from across the border also
continues unabated. India desires peaceful
and cooperative ties with Pakistan. However,
continued activities of terrorist organizations
operating from Pakistani territory and
territories under Pakistan’s control are major
obstacle and source of concern. India remains
committed to resolving all outstanding issues
with Pakistan through a peaceful, bilateral
dialogue on the basis of the Simla Agreement
and Lahore Declaration. A meaningful
dialogue requires an environment free from
terror and violence. During the meeting of
the DGMOs of both countries at Wagah
in December 2013, India reiterated the
need for Pakistan to uphold the sanctity of
the Line of Control (LoC) and International
Boundary in Jammu and Kashmir by stopping
ceasefire violations and cross IB and cross
LoC transgressions. However, the continued
existence of terrorist camps across the
international border and Line of Control and


continuing instances of ceasefire violations,
attempted infiltrations and transgressions
demonstrate the challenges faced by India
in this regard. Pakistan has continued with
its policy of selective approach to tackling
terrorist groups operating from its territory
and areas under its control which do not
serve the interests of regional peace and
security.

1.21 Although the unresolved boundary
dispute between India and China is a major
factor in India’s security calculus, India
has engaged with China on the principle
of mutual respect and sensitivity for each
other's interests, concerns and aspiration
and mutual and equal security. A number
of measures are being pursued to promote
interactions and confidence building
measures between the Armed Forces of both
sides. Both countries have agreed on the
need to maintain peace and tranquility on
the border which is an important guarantor
for the development and continued growth of
bilateral relations. India remains conscious
and watchful of the implication of China’s
increasing military profile in our immediate
and extended neighbourhood, as well as the
development of strategic infrastructure by
China in the border areas. India is also taking
necessary measures to develop the requisite
capabilities to counter any adverse impact
on our own security.

1.22 India and Bhutan have a traditional and
unique bilateral relationship, characterized by
utmost trust and deep mutual understanding
which has matured over the years. India has
been the privileged socio-economic partner of
Bhutan since 1961.Today, there is extensive
cooperation between the two countries in
all areas including in the area of trade and
economy including hydropower, defence


-----

and security, as also people-to-people level
linkages.

1.23 India and Nepal have a unique
relationship. There are a large number of
Gorkha soldiers serving in the Indian Army.
Nepal continues to be embattled with political
uncertainty. As a stable and prosperous
Nepal is in India’s interest, India is carefully
monitoring the political developments in
Nepal. External influence on Nepal, the
demography along the India-Nepal border
and possible exploitation of porosity of the
India-Nepal border by terrorists sponsored
by our adversaries, are some of the issues
that India is concerned about and will have
to monitor closely. At the same time, it will
have to be kept in mind that the 1950 Treaty
provides for an open border and is a major
asset that is a cornerstone of India-Nepal
friendship. Security cooperation between
India and Nepal is proceeding well, owing to
enhanced assistance in the form of training
and equipment supply. Nepal has handed
over several high-value terrorists/militants.
Any new measures at the border would need
to be undertaken within the framework of
the 1950 Treaty, without affecting the daily
lives and friendly exchanges of hundreds of
thousands of daily travellers.

1.24 India shares a long land border with
Bangladesh and bilateral cooperation is
a positive factor in the current security
scenario. The ties between our two countries
in the areas of security cooperation are
unparalleled.

1.25 India continues to emphasize its
security concerns to Bangladesh, especially
the use of Bangladeshi territory by Indigenous
Insurgent Groups (IIGs) and terrorists of
other nationalities. A Coordinated Border


Management Plan (CBMP), signed between
the two countries in July 2011, synergizes the
efforts of the Border Guarding Forces of both
countries for more effective control over cross
border illegal activities and crimes as well
as for maintenance of peace and harmony
along the India-Bangladesh border. A system
of institutionalized interaction for discussions
on border management through meetings at
all levels addresses all such concerns.

1.26 Myanmar is located on crossroads of
South and Southeast Asia and is India’s land
bridge to the South East Asian countries. A
stable, peaceful and democratic Myanmar
is in India’s interest. India’s engagement of
Myanmar continues to be driven by shared
economic and security interest which include
enhancing bilateral trade, strengthening
democratic institutions in Myanmar and
eliminating threats from insurgent groups
exploiting the porous borders with our
North Eastern states. India is keen that the
government of Myanmar acts against the
Indian Insurgent Groups that are operating
from its soil. A MOU on Border Cooperation,
concluded between both countries in
May 2014, provides a strong framework
for security cooperation and intelligence
exchange between India and Myanmar
security agencies in areas of coordinated
patrolling, intelligence sharing, counterinsurgency, arms-smuggling, drug, human
and wildlife trafficking. Under an MOU
on Border Area Development concluded
in 2012, projects on schools, hospitals and
bridge construction in Chin State and Naga
Self Administered Zones in Myanmar are
being supported by the Government.

1.27 Relations between India and Sri Lanka
are based on a shared cultural, religious,


-----

linguistic and historical ties and remain
cooperative and constructive. Maritime
security challenges and the maintenance of
peace and stability in the Indian Ocean region
are common concerns which provide for a
convergence of strategic interests between
both countries and the underpinning to
ongoing cooperation in the field of defence.
India has been supportive of the process
of reconciliation in Sri Lanka and supports
a lasting political settlement within the
framework of a united Sri Lanka which would
meet the aspirations of the Tamil community
for equality, justice, peace and dignity.

1.28 Security cooperation between India
and Maldives is a highly significant dimension
of bilateral cooperation, as the security
interests of both countries are interlinked.
Bilateral relations are being nurtured and
strengthened through regular contacts at the
highest levels and at various levels of the
defence forces of both countries.

1.29 The commonality of regional maritime
security challenges is the foundation for the
trilateral defence and security cooperation
framework through which India, Sri Lanka
and Maldives are working to develop joint
capabilities to respond to a variety of maritime
challenges. The initiative enables the defence


and security establishments and the Armed
Forces of all three countries to pursue practical
cooperation on a regular basis. It is expected
that the initiative which acknowledges India’s
role as the net provider of security in the
Indian Ocean neighbourhood will contribute
to the development of a cooperative vision
of security in the region.

1.30 The challenge posed by non-traditional
threats such as WMD proliferation, terrorism,
drugs, human trafficking, etc continue to
remain high on India’s security agenda. New
challenges have additionally emerged in
the domains of Cyber and Space, with the
demonstration of offensive and capabilities
by certain countries. These capabilities will
shape the security situation in the future. The
advent of asymmetric warfare capabilities
adds an additional layer of challenge
in an environment where technological
obsolescence is already a continuing
challenge in terms of conventional warfare
capabilities. These challenges are being
addressed through an across-Government,
multi-agency long-term approach, of which
the Armed Forces are an important and
intrinsic part.

###### Internal Security Environment

1.31 India faces multifaceted internal
security challenges which include left wing
extremism, an ongoing proxy war in Jammu
and Kashmir, insurgencies in some states in
the North East and organised crime.

1.32 The separatists and anti-national
elements continue in their efforts to disrupt
the prevailing calm in J&K. The North-East
Region, however, has seen a reduction in
violence levels. Public resentment against
extortions by various extremist groups in the


-----

North-East indicates that the civil society is
supportive of improving the security situation.
Left Wing extremism remains an important
challenge and is also sapping the national
resources.

1.33 In a global and regional
security environment characterized by
unpredictability and volatility, India’s


defence forces remain prepared to tackle
the full spectrum of security challenges.
Concurrently, India remains engaged with
the regional and global community through
a network of cooperative, constructive
and mutually beneficial relationships, in a
manner which would serve national interests
and also contribute to the larger interests of
global peace and stability.

###### them for implementation to the Services Headquarters, Inter- Service Organisations, Production Establishments and Research & Development Organisations.


###### ORGANISATIONAL SET-UP AND FUNCTIONS

2.1 After Independence, Ministry of
Defence was created under the charge of
a Cabinet Minister and each Service was
placed under its own Commander-in-Chief.
In 1955, the Commanders-in-Chief were
renamed as the Chief of the Army Staff, the
Chief of the Naval Staff and the Chief of the
Air Staff. In November 1962, the Department
of Defence Production was set up to deal with
research, development and production of
defence equipment. In November, 1965, the
Department of Defence Supplies was created
for planning and execution of schemes for
import substitution of defence requirements.
These two Departments were later merged
to form the Department of Defence
Production and Supplies. In 2004, the name
of Department of Defence Production and
Supplies was changed to Department of
Defence Production. In 1980, the Department
of Defence Research and Development was
created. In 2004, the Department of ExServicemen Welfare was set up.

2.2 The Defence Secretary functions as
head of the Department of Defence and is
additionally responsible for co-ordinating
the activities of the four Departments in the
Ministry.
###### THE MINISTRY AND ITS DEPARTMENTS 

2.3 The principal task of the Ministry is
to frame policy directions on defence and


security related matters and communicate
them for implementation to the Services
Headquarters, Inter-Service Organisations,

###### HEADQUARTERS INTEGRATED DEFENCE STAFF (HQ IDS)

2.7 HQ IDS was raised on October 1,
2001 based on the recommendations of
Group of Ministers on the Kargil Review
Committee (KRC) report. The HQ was
raised under the overall Command and
Control of Chairman Chiefs of Staff
Committee (COSC) to foster jointness and
synergy amongst the three Services. Since
its inception, this HQ has achieved several
milestones in joint and integrated planning,
coordination of intelligence, joint conduct
of Human Assistance and Disaster Relief
(HADR) operations through Defence Crisis
Management Group (DCMG) and prioritising/
streamlining procurements.

2.8 **Human** **Assistance** **and** **Disaster**
**Relief (HADR) Operations:** Effective and
coordinated action of the DCMG at HQ IDS
has enhanced the Armed Forces' response


and reduced the reaction time for HADR
operations.

2.9 Major HADR operations conducted
under DCMG during the year are Operation
Sarayu in the Floods affected areas in UP and
Bihar in August 2014, Operation Rahat in J
& K in September, 2014, Operation Lehar
in Cyclone Hudhud affected areas of Andhra
Pradesh and Odisha in October, 2014.

2.10 **Male Water Crisis:** In addition
to HADR operations within the country,
assistance was also rendered to provide
succour to the distressed populations in
friendly foreign countries. Recently, a Water
Desalination Plant at Male caught fire on
December 4, 2014. On request for assistance,
‘Operation Neer’ was launched wherein
374 Tons of water was provided by air and
another 2086 Tons of water was delivered by
Naval Ships. The operation was executed at
short notice and in a swift manner to provide
timely assistance to our SAARC neighbour.

2.11 **Coordinated Patrol (Corpat): Indian**
Navy undertakes coordinated Patrols

‘CORPAT’ along with Navies of Indonesia,
Thailand and Myanmar. The aim is to

###### Armed Forces Tri-Services Institutions

2.13. HQ IDS has been constantly reviewing
the joint training at nascent, intermediatory
and higher levels to foster greater jointness
amongst the Services. At the nascent level, to
address the shortage of officers in the Armed
Forces, the capacity of National Defence
Academy (NDA) has been enhanced from
1800 to 1920. In-principle approval of RM
has also been granted to further increase the
capacity of the Academy to 2400, which  will
be addressed by raising of 5th Battalion at
NDA.

2.14 Similarly, at the intermediate level, the
capacity of Defence Services Staff College
is being increased to 500 and at higher
level, capacity of HDM courses at CDM
has been increased to 150 with tailor made
capsule courses/ Management Development
Programmes (MDPs) for management
education at all levels in the Indian Armed
Forces.


2.15 **Tri –Services SF Camp: A Tri-Services**
Special Forces Camp was conducted at
Andaman & Nicobar locations of Carnic and

###### Initiatives in the Medical Field

2.20 The medical branch of HQ IDS has
made significant achievements during the
period of report in the field of automation of
medical stores and supply chain management,
telemedicine and standardisation of Joint

###### he Indian Army is committed to the defence of the country from external and internal threats across the entire spectrum
## T
###### of warfare.


###### SECURITY OVERVIEW

3.1 The changing global geo-political
dynamics presents the Nation with multiple
security challenges. While constantly
reviewing its operational preparedness/
postures to meet the perceived security
challenges, the Indian Army (IA) is committed
to the defence of the country from external
and internal threats across the entire spectrum
of warfare. Also, in times of disaster/ natural
calamities, the Indian Army is in the forefront,
providing aid and succour to the affected
populace.

###### JAMMU AND KASHMIR

3.2 The security situation in Jammu and
Kashmir(J&K) is at a very critical stage.
Relentless and successful Counter Infiltration
and Counter Terrorism operations have led
to Parliamentary and Assembly elections
being conducted successfully with high
voter turnout

3.3 Pakistan on the other hand, stepped up
its efforts both to internationalise the Kashmir
issue and to engineer violence in the state.
The terrorist infrastructure across the border
remains intact and Pakistan’s frustration
manifested itself in Cease Fire Violations
(CFVs) and high visibility, audacious attacks
by foreign terrorists.

###### Situation Along the Borders

3.4 **Ceasefire Violations (CFVs): The**
ceasefire along the Actual Ground Position
Line (AGPL), Line of Control (LC) and
International Border (IB) Sectors in Jammu


and Kashmir has generally held. However,
there has been an increase in CFVs in the
last two years. To address the issue of CFVs
established mechanisms such as DGsMO
talks, local level flag meetings and hotlines
are being used. Appropriate retaliatory action
as required, has been taken by our troops.

3.5 **Infiltration: Strict vigil is being**
maintained along the border and counter
infiltration measures adopted by the Army
have been further strengthened. During this
year 23 infiltration bids were foiled in which
36 terrorists were killed.

###### Situation in the Hinterland

3.6 **Counter** **Terrorism** **Operations:**
Sustained counter terrorism operations by
the Army has resulted in elimination of 68
terrorists in the hinterland in the year 2014.
In the previous year, the Army had eliminated
37 terrorists in the hinterland in J&K.

###### NORTH EAST

3.7 The overall security situation in
the North East is stable and under control.
The violence levels registered a marginal
increase but the Security Forces continue
to maintain ascendancy over the insurgent
groups. A total of 2406 insurgents have been
neutralized (Killed - 181, Apprehended 1934 & Surrendered - 157) by Army/ Assam
Rifles in 2014 and 1104 weapons have
been recovered. Five insurgent groups are
observing Ceasefire whereas Suspension
of Operations is in force with 42 insurgent
groups.


-----

3.8 **Assam: The security situation in**
the State remained largely peaceful and
under control. Calibrated and synergised
operations by Security Forces significantly
reduced the operational space for insurgent
groups. Tripartite talks are underway with
three major groups viz ULFA (Pro Talk),
NDFB (Progressive) and NDFB (Ranjan
Daimary). ULFA (Independent) led by
Paresh Baruah and NDFB (Songbijit) led by
IK Songbijit, however, continued with their
violent activities.

3.9 **Nagaland:** The situation in the State
remained peaceful with no major violent
incident in 2014. Ceasefire continues to
be in force with three Naga factions. The
Army and Assam Rifles carried out extensive
operations to keep the NSCN groups under
check and ensure adherence to Ceasefire
Ground Rules by them. Peace talks to find
a permanent and an acceptable solution to
the Naga issue have continued with NSCN
(IM)

3.10 **Manipur:** Meitei groups have
perpetrated most of the violence in the
State. The State also continued to witness
the politics of blockades and bandhs which
led to increasing fissures amongst the three
major communities namely; Meiteis, Nagas
and Kukis. Inter tribal rivalry and insider outsider divide were prominently visible
during 2014 and were the main reasons for
violence in Manipur.

3.11 **Security Situation in Arunachal**
**Pradesh:  Tirap, Longding and Changlang**
districts witnessed a spillover of Naga
insurgency as the ceasefire with NSCN
factions is not applicable in these three
districts. Synergised operations by Security
Forces have however, reduced the operational
space of insurgents.


3.12 **Tripura and Mizoram: The security**
situation in these two states remained under
control. Minor incidents of kidnapping/
extortion were however, carried out by the
insurgents.

3.13 **Meghalaya:** Violence remained
largely confined to the Garo hills and was
mostly perpetrated by the GNLA and UALA.
Neighboring districts of Goalpara and Dhubri
in Assam however witnessed a spillover of
the activities of these groups . Two outfits
namely ANVC and ANVC (B), signed
a Memorandum of Understanding with
Government of India and were disbanded on
December 15, 2014.

###### Situation Along the Border

3.14 **Bilateral** **Relations** **with** **China:**
Relations between India and China
have improved over the past few years.
Constructive engagement at the political,
diplomatic and military level is continuing .
The year 2014 marked the 60th Anniversary
of the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence
(Panchsheel) and to commemorate the
same, the year was declared as the Year of
India China Friendly Exchanges. The visit
of Chinese President Xi Jinping to India in
September 2014 has further strengthened the
bonds of friendship and enhanced bilateral
cooperation between both the countries.

3.15 China is engaged in creating a
favourable environment aimed at achieving
its core objectives. China is extending its
lines of access towards the Indian Ocean
through Myanmar and Pakistan. Its footprint
in India’s immediate neighbourhood has also
been increasing as a result of its proactive
diplomacy through political, military and
economic cooperation and engagement.


-----

3.16 Indian Army is fully committed to
meeting the security needs of the country
and the requirement of development of
infrastructure in the border areas. All
necessary steps have therefore been initiated
for the upgrading infrastructure and for force
accretions needed for securing national
security objectives along the Northern
borders.

3.17 **Situation Along the Line of Actual**
**Control (LAC):** The situation along IndiaChina border continues to be peaceful.
There are few areas along the border where
India and China have differing perception
of the LAC. Both sides patrol upto their
respective perceptions of LAC. Specific
cases of transgression by Chinese patrols
into such areas across LAC are taken up with
Chinese authorities through the established
mechanism of Hot Lines, Flag Meetings and
Border Personnel Meetings.

3.18 **Implementation of Border Defence**
**Cooperation Agreement (BDCA):** During
this year both countries have had wide
ranging discussions on implementation of
BDCA. Towards this, the scope of the Border
Personnel Meetings has been increased to
include conduct of non contact games and
joint celebration of festivals.

3.19 **Fourth** **Joint** **Training** **Exercise:**
The Fourth Joint Training Exercise was
successfully conducted in India (Pune) in
November, 2014 aimed at building and
promoting positive military relations, inter
operability and undertaking joint operations
in CT environment. These exercises provided
valuable opportunity for greater professional
military interaction and for enhancing
confidence in each other.


###### CAPABILITY DEVELOPMENT ALONG NORTHERN BORDERS

3.20 With the growing capability of
our adversary on the Northern Borders, a
review of capability of our security forces
was carried out. Based on the review the
Government sanctioned the Capability
Development Plan along Northern Borders
aimed at enhancing our combat capabilities.
This plan ensures that voids are reduced/
eliminated, the offensive capability of the
Army is enhanced through induction of
force multipliers and necessary combat and
logistic elements. Accretions have since
commenced with effect from December 1,
2013 as per approved timelines.

###### DEFENCE COOPERATION WITH NEIGHBOURING AND OTHER SELECTED COUNTRIES

priority.

(d) **Mobility:** Procurement of a stateof-art vehicle for the Infantry with adequate
protection as well as provision for mounting
support weapons is under progress. This
would enhance the mobility of infantry in all
types of terrain.
###### Modernisation of Field Artillery

3.36 **Guns: Modernization** of Artillery
has been on since 2012 and both global
and indigenous routes are being adopted
to hasten the progress of modernization.

_Electronically upgraded Gun System “Dhanush”_


Government has recently given a go ahead
for the procurement of Mounted Gun
System. Upgunning of the existing Guns is
also currently under progress as ‘Buy & Make
Indian’.

3.37 **Nishant** **UAV:** Nishant UAV
system is being inducted into the Army by
Aeronautical Development Establishment,
Banglore.

3.38 Manufacture of Indigenous T-90
**Tanks: Indigenously manufactured T-90**
tanks are being delivered to the Indian Army
from HVF, Avadi.


-----

3.39 **FMBT: A new futuristic Main Battle**
Tank is being conceptualised to arm the
Mechanised Forces with an Armoured
Fighting Vehicle which has advanced
technology in terms of enhanced lethality,
increased armour protection and mobility.
Introduction of FMBT is certain to provide
decisive strength and enhance the operational
capability of the Mechanised fleet.

3.40 **FICV: Mechanised Infantry Battalions**
are equipped with ICV BMP-2/ 2K which is
of 1980’s vintage. FICV are planned to be
inducted into service to replace these. An
integrated project management team has
been constituted to co-ordinate development
and production of FICVs in an acceptable
time frame.

3.41 **BMP-II: BMP-II is a state-of-the-art**
weapon system and ever since its induction
in the year 1986 has undergone various
modernization/ upgrades so as to keep pace
with the technological development on
the battle front. BMP-II has over the years
emerged as a powerful weapon system and
has enhanced the confidence and morale


of the troops using this weapon system. The
equipment is being suitably upgraded in terms
of both mobility and firepower aspects.

3.42 A continuous upgradation process of
BMP-II is on wherin the excellent chassis/
hull of this vehicle has been used to
design and induct multiple variants, which
would enhance the fighting potential of
our Mechanised Forces on the battle field.
Armoured Tracked ambulance, Carrier
Mortar Tracked (CMT) and Carrier Command
Post Tracked (CCPT) are some of the variants
of BMP-II which will provide a cutting edge
to the Mechanised Forces fleet.

###### RASHTRIYA RIFLES

3.43 Rashtriya Rifles was raised to tackle
the menace of terrorism in the state of
Jammu and Kashmir. Since its raising, it has
also rendered invaluable assistance towards
the security as well as socio-economic
development of the state.

3.44 Rashtriya Rifles has left no stone
unturned in successfully dominating their area
through relentless operations. The Force took
on the arduous task of assisting the people


-----

of Jammu and Kashmir severely affected by
the devastating floods of September 2014,
in spite of suffering damages to own life
and property. In addition, maintenance of
a comprehensive Counter Insurgency grid
during operation MEGH RAHAT has put
the terrorist organisations under pressure.
Effective sanitization of areas of responsibility
by the Force led to successful conduct of Lok
Sabha elections and State Assembly polls. The
continued presence of Rashtriya Rifles has
given people of Jammu and Kashmir much
needed assurance to vote without fear or
intimidation and the resultant effect is clearly
visible in the hither to fore unprecedented
high voter turnouts, not seen in the last 25
years. The assiduous efforts of the Force in
both operations and disaster relief have been
extensively covered in print and electronic
media across the country thereby projecting
a positive image of the Army in the national
as well as international community.

3.45 Utmost patience and perseverance
yet urgency were maintained for conversion
of untiring efforts into successful operations.
During the complete period, units of Rashtriya
Rifles were able to exert unrelenting pressure
on the terrorists and their sympathizers. The
efforts of the Force have ensured peace and
near normalcy in the area with unyielding
operations against the forces of terror.

3.46 **Conduct of Elections:  An action plan**
for security during conduct of National and
State Assembly elections was prepared to
include domination of the line of control,
hinterland and of Pir Panjal range. Sensitive
and hyper sensitive poll booths were
dominated and Para Military Forces were
assisted ensuring peaceful conduct of the
Elections. This instilled a sense of confidence


in the people and the upbeat mood of the
people can be gauged by the highest voter
turnout in the last 25 years in the State
Assembly elections.

3.47 **Perception Management: A** large
number of people friendly activities were
undertaken to shape the people’s perception
about the Army and government and this has
made a visible change in the way people
perceive the Army, besides increasing the
comfort levels between 'Awaam' and 'Jawan'.
A number of theme based tours for different
population groups like school children,
unemployed youth and village elders were
conducted with an aim to integrate the local
population with the national mainstream
while also providing an opportunity to
experience the nation’s historical and cultural
heritage. Youth Employment and Guidance
Nodes (YEGN), conducted by Rashtriya Rifles
effectively targeted the unemployed youth of
the State and helped them explore avenues
of higher education and employment, thus
guiding them away from the lure of easy
money and a misplaced sense of power
through terrorism.

###### TERRITORIAL ARMY

3.48 The Territorial Army Act was enacted
in 1948. The concept of the TA is to provide
part time military training to gainfully
employed citizens who become competent
soldiers as a result of the military training
imparted to them.

3.49 **Prime Minister’s TA Day Parade: On**

###### UN MISSIONS

3.53 India has been the founder member
of United Nations and has been a prolific
contributor to UN Peacekeeping Operations
since 1950, when 60 Field Ambulance
consisting of 346 personnel was deployed
in Korea. India has till date participated in
50 UN missions across the globe and has
contributed more than 2,15,000 Indian
troops to various UN Missions. The most
significant contribution of the Indian Army
has been to ensure peace and stability
in Africa and parts of Asia. Towards the
fulfillment of India’s commitment to the
UN and peace, 157 Indian peacekeepers
(Military and Police) have made the supreme
sacrifice so far.

3.54 **Leadership in UNPKO: India has**
so far provided 16 Force Commanders in

and one Deputy Military Advisor to the
Secretary General of the United Nations.

3.55 **Our Present Contribution: India at**
present is the third largest troop contributor
in UN PKO. Presently Indian Army has 7,159
persons deployed in eight UN peacekeeping
missions. Our present contributions
and achievements in UN missions are
as follows:


-----

(a) **MONUSCO (Democratic Republic**
**of Congo) (1999 – till date):  India’s**
contribution to MONUSCO commenced
with the deputation of military Observers
in 1999. With increased demands for troop
contribution, India had deployed an Infantry
Brigade Group with four Infantry Battalion
Groups, Brigade Signal Company and a Level
III Hospital in Congo since November 2004.
An Army Aviation Flight was also deployed
in the mission area w.e.f. 2009. Democratic
Republic of Congo (DRC) is the second
largest country in the African Continent and
has faced protracted period of unrest and
instability since its independence in 1960; a
period characterized by two civil wars and
ethnic conflicts. The operating conditions for
the Indian Brigade in Congo are challenging,
replete with inhospitable terrain and adverse
climatic conditions. The Brigade is mandated
to carry out protection of civilians which is
the primary role. The Brigade has contributed
significantly towards implementation of
the MONUSCO mandate and is regarded
extremely favorable by the international
community. The efforts of the Indian Brigade
have helped in bringing normalcy in North
Kivu Province. In a joint offensive with Force
Intervention Brigade (FIB) and Congolese
Government Forces, M-23 (rebel group) was
decimated in April/ May 2014. Presently,
the Brigade is assisting in the operations (OP
SUKOLA-I and II) against minor rebel groups
existing in the territory. The Brigade facilitated
surrender of armed cadres including child
soldiers and dependents through its bases,
thereby encouraging restoration of normalcy
in the region. The North Kivu Brigade also
undertakes great initiatives for alleviating the
suffering of the local Congolese by launching
various humanitarian activities. In order


to further strengthen Indian contingent’s
operational capability, 40 Tonnes of critical
ammunition was inducted in IAF Globe
Master to the mission area on November 15
to 17, 2013. In addition, Indian Army is under
process of replacing the entire equipment of
the contingents costing Rs 418 Crore. Due to
sustained effort of the Indian Brigade deployed
in DRC, the security situation in North Kivu
has improved and there are realistic chances
of laying the foundation for lasting peace in
DRC.

(b) UNMISS (South Sudan) (Jul 2011 – till
date): The UN Mission in Sudan (UNMIS)
was closed down on July 9, 2011 and the
UN HQ opened a new mission viz UNMISS
(South Sudan). Government of India approved
moving the Indian Army contingents
which were deployed in UNMIS (Sudan) to
UNMISS (South Sudan). On July 9, 2011,
the independent state of Republic of South
Sudan was formed in a complex and fragile
regional environment. India has deployed two
Infantry Battalion Groups, a Level II Hospital,
Horizontal Military Engineering Company,
Petroleum Platoon and a Signal Company
in UNMISS. A civil war started in South
Sudan in December 2013 due to the ethnic
divide in the society. Timely intervention of
Indian contingents resulted in saving lives of
approximately 40,000 Internally Displaced
People (IDP) during the inter tribal clashes. In
the last one year, Indian Army has bolstered
the operational capability of its contingents
in the mission area by inducting four Mine
Protected Vehicles (MPVs) in the IAF aircraft
on May 19 and 21, 2013. In addition, the
entire equipment of the contingents is being
replaced and more than half of the equipment
has been inducted to the mission area.


-----

(c) UNIFIL (Lebanon) (1998 – till date):
The Indian Army’s contribution to UNIFIL
includes one Infantry Battalion Group, Level
I Hospital and Staff Officers. The battalion
is deployed in mountainous terrain and has
an area of responsibility of approximately
100 square kilometers. The contingent has
been successful in maintaining peace and
stability in its area of responsibility in spite
of the unrest in Syria and Gaza, through
relentless patrolling activities in close
coordination with Lebanese Armed Forces.
The Contingent regularly organises large
number of humanitarian activities to include
medical, dental and veterinary camps, so
as to provide succor and solace to the local
population. As a result close contact and
special support has been achieved with the
local population which further assists in
achievement of operational tasks.

(d) UNDOF (Golan Heights) (2006 – till
date): India has deployed a logistic Contingent
as part of UNDOF in Golan Heights. The
contingent is responsible for providing
second line logistics support to the mission.
The contingent has done a commendable
job in spite of the withdrawal of Japanese,
Croatian and Austrian contingents from the
mission and more recently withdrawal of
Philippines Battalion in September 2014.


###### Human Rights Protection Record

3.56 India has a policy of zero tolerance
with regard to conduct and discipline of
troops including, Sexual Exploitation and
Abuse (SEA). India favours induction of
more female peacekeepers and encourages
DPKO to be more proactive in this process.
The officers and men of the Indian Army
are proud of their heritage and have an
unmatched reputation to live up to. Their
sense of commitment to duty inspires them to
give sacrifice of the highest order to uphold
the glorious traditions of the Army. As in
numerous and complex UN missions over
the past five decades, the Indian Army can
be trusted, when called upon, to participate
in future UN peacekeeping endeavors with
professional elan.

3.57 All Indian soldiers leaving the shores
to participate in a UN mission take an oath
administered on behalf of the President
of India. Neutrality, fairness and respect
for human rights have to be an essential
component of their training and at all times
they have to also provide an element of
reassurance by their very presence. India
has had one of the best records in the arena
of human rights amongst peacekeepers.
Despite being one of the largest troop
contributors till date, our HR records are
immaculate and best in comparison to all
other countries.

##### INDIAN NAVY

_Commissioning of INS Kolkata_


-----

###### he Indian Navy is the prime enabler and guarantor of the country’s maritime sovereignty and myriad use-of-sea
## T
###### activities.


4.1  The Indian Navy (IN) is the prime
enabler and guarantor of the country’s
maritime sovereignty and myriad use-of-sea
activities. This is discharged by the Indian Navy
through its four roles – military, diplomatic,
constabulary and benign. The objective of the
Navy’s military role is deterrence/ dissuasion
against any intervention or act which is
against our National interests, and the ability
to inflict a crushing defeat on the adversary
in the event of hostilities. A major objective
of the Navy’s Constabulary role is to ensure
coastal security and implement anti-piracy
measures.

4.2 The Maritime Military Strategy
recognises that one of the major tasks of the
Indian Navy during the 21st Century is to use
maritime power in support of the national
foreign policy. To achieve this, the Indian
Navy needs to project power and show
presence in our primary and secondary areas
of interest; catalyse partnerships through
maritime capability; build trust and create
interoperability through joint/ combined
exercises and international maritime
assistance. The strategy also highlights
Indian Navy's role in maintaining peace
and tranquillity in the Indian Ocean Region
(IOR) and in meeting the expectations of our
friends.

4.3  India is a maritime nation and the
country sits astride a very large number of
busy International Shipping Lanes that crisscross the Indian Ocean. More than 90%
of our trade by volume and 77% by value
is transported over the seas. For a rapidly


growing economy seeking new markets
worldwide, these figures will only increase
in the future.The IOR is also beset by a
number of security-related challenges. These
include natural and man-made disasters,
sea-borne trafficking in drugs, arms, human
beings, piracy and terrorism. As most of
these challenges have trans-national/ transregional footprint, it becomes imperative
to seek collective solutions to these issues.
The Indian Navy does so by a process of
‘Constructive Engagement’ with our maritime
partners.

4.4 The Indian Navy has been actively
pursuing activities towards capability
building and capacity enhancement
of Navies of friendly countries in the
IOR. Towards this end, India has been
providing hardware and platforms, which
includes ships and aircraft for Exclusive
Economic Zone (EEZ) surveillance.
Indian Navy has also been instrumental
in maritime infrastructure development
of friendly nations. Its initiatives are
also geared to contributing towards
developing operational and technical
skills of maritime practitioners. Material
assistance in terms of providing spares,
AIS equipment, Ship Handling Simulators,
ammunition, communication equipment,
coastal surveillance radars, boats, etc to
the navies/ maritime forces in the region.
This has gone a long way in strengthening
India’s stature and bilateral ties.

4.5 A frontline Fleet ship has been
continuously deployed in the Gulf of Aden


-----

region since October 2008 on a rotational
basis to prevent piracy attacks and safely
escort merchant ships of Indian and foreign
nationalities.

4.6 Protection to offshore assets including
Offshore Development Areas (ODAs) has
been augmented with deployments of the
newly inducted Immediate Support Vessels
(ISVs). Regular exercises have been conducted
at ODAs to validate the safety and security
of ODA platforms which are vital to India’s
energy security.

-----

###### he IAF’s Doctrine is to acquire strategic reach and capabilities across the spectrum of conflict that serve the ends of military
## T
###### diplomacy, nation building and enable force projection within India’s strategic area of influence.


5.1 On October 8, 2014, Indian Air
Force (IAF) celebrated the 82nd anniversary
of its service to the nation. Its journey to
this point has been shaped by committed
professionalism, steadfast duty and a
consistent vision for the future. The IAF’s
Doctrine articulates this vision as, “To
acquire strategic reach and capabilities
across the spectrum of conflict that serve the
ends of military diplomacy, nation building
and enable force projection within India’s
strategic area of influence.”

5.2 Continuing its story of evolution
to become an aerospace power, IAF has
acquired assets and expanded operations
to span a wide spectrum of capability.
Additional Su-30 MKI aircraft are joining the
existing fleet, C-17 Globemaster III aircraft
have imparted strategic dimension to airlift,
while the C-130 J30 aircraft augment the
medium airlift and Special Operations role.
Medium lift helicopters have provided a
surge towards modernisation with the Mi-17
V5. Air Defence Radars have been inducted
to improve coverage of Indian airspace and
Surface to Air Missile capability is receiving
a fillip with the Akash missile system being
made operational.

5.3 Consequent to this expansion is
a requirement for infrastructure to cater
for modern systems, which often require
very specific conditions for operations,
maintenance and storage. In 2014-15, the
IAF consolidated its inductions, and laid
emphasis on the supporting environment
for its enhanced inventory. This included
a careful look at training programmes that


would prepare its air warriors – officers and
airmen – to optimally understand and exploit
these systems.

5.4 Humanitarian Assistance and
Disaster Relief (HADR) is one of the key
tasks of the IAF, and it has risen to the
challenge whenever called upon to do so.
The calamitous floods in Kashmir Valley
this year saw the IAF undertake Operation
Megh Rahat. Approximately 70 IAF aircraft
were deployed in HADR missions. In
coordination with the Indian Army, National
Disaster Response Force (NDRF) and civil
agencies, over 96,000 people were rescued
and over 3500 tonnes of relief material
airlifted. Air effort during Cyclone Hudhud
in Orissa was another sterling contribution
by the IAF. Also, air support provided
during the 2014 General Elections, search
and rescue operations, air maintenance
missions flown towards Operation Triveni
as well as sustained air maintenance for
Indian Army were notable achievements
during the year.

5.5 Fulfilling its mandate as the Air Force
of a proud nation, the IAF re-dedicated
itself to the belief that it will continue to be
exclusive for its exceptional professional
standards, while remaining inclusive in its
service to the people of India.

###### OPERATIONS

of the IAF have already seen a major boost
with induction of Mi-17 V5, which has better
avionics, weapon systems and improved
performance. The existing Mi-17 and
Mi-17 1V helicopters are also proposed to be
upgraded. Mark III variant of Advanced Light
Helicopters (ALH) is already in the process
of induction; the Weapon System Integrated
(WSI) version, ALH Mark IV, is also planned
to be inducted after certification.


5.8 **MiG-29 Upgrade: After completing**
the final stages of flight tests, Series Upgrade
for the MiG-29 fleet has commenced at a _Mi-17 V5 Helicopter_
Base Repair Depot of the IAF.
###### Milestones


_MiG-29 Upgrade Aircraft_


5.12 **C-17 Globemaster III: A contract for**
supply of C-17 aircraft was signed with United
States Government in June 2011. C-17 aircraft
is a heavy military cargo aircraft capable of
operating from high altitude airfields in hot
conditions and conveys combat units over
thousands of kilometers with in-flight refueling
capability, thereby reducing re-deployment


-----

time within India and abroad. Its induction
has given a significant strategic reach to the
IAF. During recent floods in Kashmir and
devastation caused by cyclone ‘Hudhud’ in
the coastal regions of Odisha and Andhra
Pradesh, C-17 aircraft were pressed into
operation, providing enhanced effectiveness
of aid to the civilian population. The fleet is
being operationalised in a graduated manner.
In addition to routine air transport roles, the
fleet has also been utilised to airlift critical
load for missions abroad.

_C-17 Globemaster III_

5.13 **Pilatus PC -7 Mk-II Basic Trainer**
**Aircraft: IAF has inducted the PC-7 MK II**
Basic Trainer Aircraft (BTA) from M/s Pilatus,
Switzerland. Since first delivery of BTA in
February 2013, this highly reliable fleet
has flown more than 22,000 flying hours.
Delivery of all contracted aircraft is expected
to be completed by August 2015.

5.14 **Additional C-130 J30: The first C-130**
J30 sqn has been made fully operational.
More aircraft are planned for procurement
that would give a boost to Special Operations
and air mobility potential of the IAF. The
platform is also extremely versatile in HADR
response situations.

5.15 **Indigenous Procurement: Of late,**
a conscious decision has been taken to


promote indigenous development and
procurement of military hardware. The Light
Combat Helicopter (LCH) and the Light
Utility Helicopter (LUH) are both at a fairly
advanced stage of Design and Development.
Induction of these helicopters is projected by
2020.

###### Air Defence Network

5.16 **Akash Missile System: Akash Air**
Defence Weapon System is an all-weather
Air Defence weapon system for defending
vital assets against targets penetrating from
low, medium and high altitudes. A contract
for Akash Squadrons was signed with M/s
Bharat Electronics Limited (BEL), Bangalore.
Some Squadrons have been made operational
and equipment for some others has been
delivered.

5.17 **SPYDER Missile System: IAF is**
procuring SPYDER Missile System from M/s
Rafael, Israel to provide quick response
against aerial threats at low altitude, for the
protection of High Value Assets (HVAs).

5.18 **Control and Reporting:** In order
to augment its surveillance capabilities,
IAF is continuing to modernise its radar
network. To that end, radars incorporating
new frontline technology are being inducted


-----

and made operational. These include Rohini
Radars, Medium Powered Radars, and radars
to augment Low Level coverage.

5.19 **Release of Vayusenix 3.0: IAF uses**
a customised Operating System called
Vayusenix to secure the computers of IAF
connected on the Internet from persistent
cyber attacks.  Major highlights of the new
updated Vayusenix Version 3.0 are:

(a) More user friendly with look and feel of
windows.

(b) All users are able to customise their
desktop.

(c) Browser is customised to block malicious
and inappropriate websites.

5.20 **Captive** **Communication** **for**
**Operations:** Keeping pace with its
modernisation needs, IAF has taken a giant
leap towards Net-Centric Warfare (NCW)
with convergence of voice and data systems
with an IP based network called AFNET.
AFNET is based on OFC backbone with
Satcom fallback for vital communications.

5.21 The Tropo Communication network
has been the mainstay of the Air Defence
communication network of the IAF for the
past four decades. This network with pointto-point telephone lines between the Air
Defence Direction Centres (ADDCs), Ground
Control Interception (GCI) Radars and Air
Bases provided instantaneous voice, facsimile
and data communication facilities to update
Air Situation Picture (ASP) at ADDCs.

5.22 The existing Tropo communication
network is being upgraded to provide an
overlay to AFNET. The upgraded Tropo
Communication system will provide IAF a


captive, reliable and secure IP based telecommunication network necessary for
modern Air Defence Communications with
an expected availability of 99.9%.

###### Exercises with Foreign Air Forces

5.23 **Exercise Garuda-V: The fifth Indo-**
French exercise Garuda-V was successfully
conducted at Air Force Stations Jodhpur and
Agra from June 2 to 13, 2014. The French
Air Force (FAF) participated with four of
its Rafale multi-role fighters, one KC-135
Flight Refuelling Aircraft and a contingent
of 94 FAF personnel. The exercise provided
an excellent opportunity for both air forces
to gain an understanding of each other’s
operational philosophies.

5.24 **Indo-Russian Exercise: The first**
Indo-Russian exercise AVIA INDRA-14 was
conducted in two phases. The theme of the
exercise was to prepare and conduct combat
activities by mixed (Indo-Russian) fighter,
helicopter and Air Defence crew. Phase-I
of the exercise was conducted successfully
in Russia from August 25 to September 5,
2014, in which a 20 member IAF contingent
participated. Phase-II of the exercise was
conducted from November 17 to 28, 2014
at Air Force Station Halwara. 18 Russian
Federation Air Force personnel participated
in this exercise. The flying exercise was
conducted on IAF Su-30 MKI fighter aircraft
as well as on Mi-35 and Mi-17 helicopters.

5.25 **India-Singapore Ex JMT-14:  A joint**
India-Singapore flying exercise JMT-14 was
conducted at Air Force Station Kalaikunda
from October 13 to November 20, 2014. Six
F-16 aircraft and 108 personnel of Republic

5.26 **Other Exercises:** Indo-Sri Lanka
Special Forces Ex ‘Mitra Shakti-II’ and IndoChina Joint Training/Ex ‘Hand in Hand 2014’
were conducted in October and November
2014 respectively.

5.27 **Aerospace Safety: For reducing the**
number of aircraft incidents/ accidents,
Government had instituted an Expert
Committee on Aircraft Accidents (EXCOM)
in 2005. The committee brought out the
need for undertaking Joint Quality Audit
(JQA) of HAL divisions and IAF operating
units, with members from both HAL and
IAF for transparent sharing of problems
and resolving these with mutual help.


Joint Quality Audit of HAL manufacturing
divisions and IAF operating units was thus
initiated once in two years. JQA team would
critically examine the production and
maintenance practices, documentation and
Quality assurance at the HAL production
facilities as well as IAF operational units and
recommend measures to improve efficiency,
reliability and safety.

5.28 **Development of Infrastructure in**
**North-East: The decision to go ahead**
with the development of infrastructure in
Eastern Air Command Area of Responsibility
(AOR) was taken in 2008. Consequently,
an empowered committee to oversee
the progress of works was constituted
and detailed project reports for various
infrastructure development works including
development of ALGs in Arunachal Pradesh
were accorded approval. The works at
ALGs and a few other Air Force Stations in
EAC AOR are under progress. This would
enhance the operational capabilities of
Indian Air Force and will definitely give a
boost to civil aviation and Tourism in the
state of Arunachal Pradesh.

###### continuously modernizing and upgrading their capabilities and widening their product range.


7.1 Department of Defence Production
(DDP) was set up in November 1962 with
the objective of developing a comprehensive
production infrastructure to produce the
weapons/ systems/ platforms/ equipments
required for defence. Over the years, the
Department has established wide ranging
production facilities for various defence
equipments through the Ordnance Factories
and Defence Public Sector Undertakings
(DPSUs). The products manufactured include
arms and ammunition, tanks, armoured
vehicles, heavy vehicles, fighter aircraft and
helicopters, warships, submarines, missiles,
ammunition, electronic equipment, earth
moving equipment, special alloys and special
purpose steels.

7.2  The organizations under the Department
of Defence Production are as follows:

7.5 DPSUs and Ordnance Factories
have, as a policy, been outsourcing many of
their requirements and have over the years
developed a wide vendor base which includes
a large number of medium and small scale
enterprises apart from large scale industries.
In addition, the DPSUs and OFB are also
striving to increase the indigenous content in
equipment and products, manufactured by
them.

###### PRIVATE SECTOR PARTICIPATION

7.6 To achieve the goal of self-reliance
in the Defence sector, continuous efforts
are being made to increase indigenization,
wherever technologically feasible and
economically viable.

7.7 In May, 2001, the Defence Industry
sector, which was hitherto reserved for the


public sector, was opened up to 100% for
Indian private sector participation, with
Foreign Direct Investment (FDI) up to 26%
both subject to licensing. Recently the
Department of Industrial Policy & Promotion,
Ministry of Commerce & Industry has raised
the FDI limit from Government route up
to 49% and above 49% through Cabinet

###### RDO’s mandate is to provide assessment and advice on scientific aspects of weapons, platforms and surveillance
## D
###### sensors; to carry out research and to develop cutting edge technologies leading to production of state-of-the-art sensors, weapon systems, platforms and allied equipment for our defence Services.


###### BACKGROUND

8.1 Defence Research and Development
Organization (DRDO) is the Research
and Development arm of the Ministry of
Defence. It was created in 1958 by merging
the units of Defence Science Organisation,
which was set up in 1948 to advise and
assist the defence Services on scientific
problems and to undertake research in areas
related to defence, with the then existing
Technical Development Establishments of
the three Services. Subsequently, a separate
Department of Defence Research and
Development (DDR&D) was formed in 1980
to improve administrative efficiency. Starting
from a cluster of about 10 laboratories in
1958, DRDO today has 46 laboratories
which are spread far and wide; from Tezpur
in the east to Mumbai in the west, from Leh
in the north to Kochi in the south.

8.2 DRDO’s mandate is to provide
assessment and advice on scientific aspects of
weapons, platforms and surveillance sensors; to
carry out research and to develop cutting edge
technologies leading to production of state-ofthe-art sensors, weapon systems, platforms and
allied equipment for our defence Services. In
the recent past, the mandate has been widened
to support national cyber security architecture
which includes testing capabilities, security
solutions, networking systems and cyber defence
tools. In this process, it has also established
national infrastructure, enhanced defence
industrial capability and developed committed
quality human resources.


###### ORGANISATIONAL STRUCTURE

8.3 DRDO is headed by the Scientific
Adviser to Raksha Mantri (SA to RM) who is
also the Secretary, Department of Defence
Research and Development and Director
General R&D (DGR&D).

8.4 Based on the R&D work carried out
by the 46 laboratories of DRDO, they are
grouped into seven technology clusters
namely, Armament and Combat Engineering
Systems (ACE), Aeronautical Systems (AERO),
Missiles and Strategic Systems (MSS), Naval
Systems and Materials (NS & M), Electronics
and Communication Systems (ECS), Micro
Electronic Devices and Computational
Systems (MED & CoS) and Life Sciences (LS).
Each of these clusters functions under the
administrative control of the cluster DGs.
The seven DG offices are located at Pune
(ACE), Bengaluru (Aero and ECS), Hyderabad
(MSS), Vishakhapatnam (NS & M) and Delhi
(MED & CoS and LS).

8.5 In addition, DDR&D has one
autonomous body viz. Aeronautical
Development Agency, one joint venture
viz. BrahMos Aerospace, four human
resource institutions i.e. Centre for Personnel
Talent Management (CEPTAM), Institute of
Technology Management (ITM), Military
Institute of Training (MILIT) and Recruitment
and Assessment Centre (RAC), one deemed
university viz. Defence Institute of Advance
Technology (DIAT) and three certification
agencies i.e. Centre for Military Airworthiness


-----

and Certification for airworthiness of
products, Centre for Fire Explosive and
Environment Safety for fire and explosives
and Scientific Analysis Group for grading of
information security products under its fold.
These certification agencies provide services
not just for DRDO but other organisations of
Government of India as well. Four research
boards (Aeronautics, Naval, Armaments
and Life Sciences) functioning under DRDO
funding, provide thrust to basic research in
academia in areas of strategic importance.
###### DRDO HEADQUARTERS

8.6 DRDO headquarters (HQ) at Delhi,
which coordinates the overall functioning of
the organisation, is the interface between the
Government and the laboratories. The HQ

_Appendix-III_

###### Summary of Important Audit Observation – Ministry of Defence Report No.4 of 2014 (Air Force and Navy)


###### I Unfruitful expenditure on development of a system

Due to injudicious decision to persist
with a programme for development of
Electronic Warfare suite sanctioned to
enhance the operational capability of an
aircraft, an investment of `156 crore was
rendered largely unfruitful.
**(Paragraph 2.1)**

###### II  Delay in upgradation of an aircraft

Due to delay in initiation and conclusion
of the contract, facilities for upgradation of an
aircraft could not be set up in time despite
an investment of `272 crore on Transfer of
Technology resulting in grounding of more
than 50 per cent of the transport aircraft fleet.
**(Paragraph 2.2)**

###### III Avoidable expenditure in procurement of aero-engines

Despite being aware of long term
requirement of aero-engines, IAF failed to
project the entire requirement which resulted
in an extra avoidable expenditure of `227
crore on procurement of 100 aero-engines.
**(Paragraph 2.3)**

###### IV Non-inclusion of variable percentage of profit in the contract for acquisition of Landing Craft Utility

The contract for acquisition of eight
Landing Craft Utilities (LCUs) at a cost of
`2169 crore, allowed a flat 10 per cent profit
to the Shipyard. Inclusion of performance


related profit in the contract would have
given the Ministry control over the profit
element based on the performance of the
shipyard. By allowing a fixed 10 per cent
profit element, Ministry denied itself the
leverage of reducing the profit to an extent of
`40.96 crore. Besides, provision of `9 crore
towards Project Management Cost in the
contract was unjustified.
**(Paragraph 2.4)**

###### V Avoidable expenditure on procurement of test equipment

Procurement of additional test equipment
worth `11 crore to meet the increased work
load was avoidable as the test equipment for
setting up the base repair level facility at BRD
had already been procured earlier which
could cater to the increased work load.

**(Paragraph 3.1)**

###### VI Delay in commissioning of testers

Due to non-inclusion of commissioning
clause in the contracts, testers procured
at a cost of `5.47 crore could not be
commissioned for over four years and had
since been rendered unserviceable.

**(Paragraph 3.2)**

###### VII Directorate of Mechanical Transport, Air Headquarters.

Directorate of Mechanical Transport
(DMT) at Air HQ is responsible for planning,


-----

forecasting, provisioning and budgeting
in respect of ranges of vehicles and their
associated equipment. During detailed
audit of DMT Air HQ and units there under
from April 2012 to September 2012, Audit
observed that 408 Aircraft Support Vehicles
(ASVs) costing `132.09 crore planned (2007)
in the backdrop of Ops Parakaram could
not be procured. Besides, 37 weapon loader
trolleys valuing `6.63 crore procured for SU
– 30 units were found unsuitable, thereby
depriving these units of a vital ASV. The
newly introduced Common User Vehicles
(CUVs) were diverted to use for other than
the intended purpose. Delay in outsourcing
of staff cars by Air Force Station, New Delhi
despite Ministry’s insistence, deprived IAF
of envisaged (2008) annual savings of `1.95
crore on outsourcing of staff cars.

**(Paragraph 3.3)**

###### VIII Availability of airfield infrastructure/runways in Indian Air Force

Airfield is an area of land comprising
runways, taxi-tracks, dispersals, blast pens
and entire zone of safety surrounding the area
which is used for the operation of the aircraft.
During scrutiny of records pertaining to ten
runways resurfacing project, Audit observed
that there were cases of delays in sanction
of works for runways resurfacing and blast
pens. There were also delays in execution
of works especially due to change of design
sought after the sanction leading to time
and cost overruns. Runways at three stations
were not fit for operation of fighter aircraft. In
most of the cases, the work executed by the
contractor was of substandard quality and
supervision by MES was also poor.

**(Paragraph 3.5)**


###### IX Blocking of funds due to improper planning and execution of work

Sanction of work for re-routing of
electrical lines without obtaining necessary
consent from the Revenue Authorities led to
blocking of funds amounting to `6.14 crore
from the year 2008.

**(Paragraph 3.6)**

###### X Avoidable payment of Income Tax

Failure of MoD to adhere to the
contractual provision for availing of
concessions on duties resulted in avoidable
payment of `69.40 crore on account of
Income Tax.

**(Paragraph 3.7)**

###### XI Allotment of Office space to a private organisation

Irregular allotment of office space to
a private organisation by DRDO led to a
revenue loss of `5.67 crore to the State.

**(Paragraph 3.8)**

###### XII Recoveries at the instance of Audit

At the instance of Audit, the IAF
authorities recovered an irregular payment of
`0.70 crore made to the IAF personnel and a
private firm. Principal Controller of Defence
Accounts (Navy) recovered `1.39 crore from
a private firm as liquidated damage for the
late delivery of fuel barges, only after being
pointed out by Audit.

**(Paragraph 3.10 and 4.10)**


-----

###### XIII Inadequacies in the refit of a submarine

Failure on the part of the Indian Navy
to synchronise the procurement of 204 types
of spares necessary for undertaking the refit
of a submarine, in 2006 affected the quality
and completeness of the refit. Additionally,
the belated procurement of only 89 spares
at a later date led to an extra expenditure of
`18 crore.

**(Paragraph 4.1)**

###### XIV Unfruitful expenditure of `33.91 crore on Maintenance Dredging

Maintenance Dredging is an annual
activity undertaken to maintain a minimum
depth in Naval channels and areas for the
safe navigation of ships, submarines and other
crafts. Even though dredging in monsoon
was not a viable option, dredging during
the peak monsoon due to delay in tendering
and conclusion of the contract, rendered an
expenditure of `33.91 crore unfruitful.

**(Paragraph 4.6)**

###### XV Unfruitful expenditure on construction of a Hangar

Improper selection of the contractor,
subsequent poor contract management
and faulty design of the structure resulted
in an unfruitful expenditure of `6.72 crore
in constructions of a hangar at INS Rajali,
Arakkonam. Even after lapse of more than a
decade, the operational requirement at INS
Rajali, for an additional hangar, could not be
met.

**(Paragraph 4.8)**


###### XVI False claim of Dip Money

All qualified divers of the Indian Navy,
belong to a specialised cadre, and are entitled
to “Diving Allowance” and “Dip Money”.
However, at INDT (Delhi), weak internal
controls, improper document maintenance
and falsification of official records, led to
an incorrect payment of `10.24 lakh as Dip
Money.

**(Paragraph 4.9)**

###### XVII Excess payment of Island Special Duty Allowance in Navy

Island Special Duty Allowance (ISDA)
for the personnel serving at the Andaman
and Nicobar Islands, is not admissible during
leave / training beyond 15 days at a time
and beyond 30 days in a year and during
suspension and joining time. However
incorrect interpretation of the Government
Orders relating to regulation of payment of
ISDA by the Navy led to an overpayment of
`3.29 crore. Further, despite being aware of
this irregularity, the Navy did not take any
steps to rectify the situation.

**(Paragraph 4.11)**

###### XVIII Avoidable expenditure on Short Refit of Indian Coast Guard Ship Vikram

As per the Coast Guard Instructions for
ships awaiting decommissioning/ disposal,
only essential repairs termed as Essential
Repairs Dry Docking (ERDD) should be
undertaken to ensure safe floatation till
disposal of the vessel. Contrary to this, an
expensive Short Refit (SR) was carried out at
a cost of `5.66 crore on Indian Coast Guard
Ship Vikram due to lack of co-ordination


-----

between the two Directorates of ICGHQ
which was avoidable.

**(Paragraph 5.1)**

###### XIX Qualitative Requirements based projects at Naval DRDO laboratories

Report No. 30 of 2013 U n i o n
Government (Defence Services) Army and
Ordnance Factories

###### II MINISTRY OF DEFENCE

 Para 2.1 Improper management of defence land

Despite highlighting cases of poor
management of Defence Estates in the
various Audit Reports repeatedly and issue
of specific directions by the PAC for strict
compliance with the concerned Rules and
Regulations, there had been no significant
improvement in the management of defence
land. As a result, the irregularities relating
to misuse of Defence land, inordinate delay
in renewal/ termination of leases involving
huge accumulation of arrears of rentals,
unauthorised occupation of Defence land by
other departments etc. continued to persist.

###### Para 2.3 Non introduction of Air Conditioners in Tanks

Ignoring the recommendations of the
trial team, the Ministry of Defence procured
Tanks ‘X’ valuing `9083.36 crore in 2001 and
2007 without Air Conditioners rendering the
fleet of Tank ‘X’ vulnerable to degradation
of sensitive components. Although the
action for procurement of Air-Conditioners
was initiated in 2002, the same was yet to
materialise.


###### Para 2.4 Non-synchronization of payments without corresponding progress of work

Monitoring Cell consisting of members
from Army and Bharat Earth Movers Limited
failed to release payments judiciously,
without linking the same to corresponding
progress of work resulting in release of
`110 crore as interest free advance to M/s
Bharat Earth Movers Limited. As a result,
order placed in 2001 for supply of Pontoon
Mid stream bridges did not fructify despite
advance payment of `313.72 crore made
almost nine years ago.

###### Para 2.5 Absence of effective controls resulting in non recovery of outstanding dues

Ambiguity about the responsibility
between Ministry of External Affairs (MEA)
and Ministry of Defence (MoD) for recoveries
pertaining to Peace Keeping Missions from
the United Nations (UN) not only resulted in
accumulation of huge outstanding balances
but also in unlikely reimbursement of `73.84
crore due from four missions which have
since been closed.

###### III ARMY

 Para 3.1 Acceptance of sub- standard stores without prior technical inspection from an unregistered and inexperienced firm

The Integrated Headquarters of
Ministry of Defence (Army) procured Mask
Face Extreme Cold Weather valuing `2.54
crore between April 2008 and August 2008
from an unregistered vendor without proper
survey and prior approval of sample resulting


-----

in non-utilisation of 92783 number valuing
`1.82 crore.

###### Para 3.4 Avoidable expenditure on re-transportation of stores

The failure of Army Headquarters,
to implement the ‘Transportation Model’
envisaging direct dispatch of stores by the
supplier to the ultimate consignee resulted
in avoidable extra expenditure of `5.45
crore defeating the proposal for which
transportation model was envisaged.

###### Para 3.5 Extra expenditure on account of provision of unauthorised strengthening measures in buildings

In violation of Indian Standard 1893:
2002, National Building Code of India 2005
and Central Command Works specifications,
concerned competent financial authorities
accorded sanctions incorporating additional
plinth areas rates for construction of buildings
in seismic zones II and III resulting in extra
expenditure of `2.34 crore.

###### Para 3.6 Unauthorised use of Defence accommodation

Notwithstanding the specific
Government orders and various Reports of
the C&AG, the local Commanders misused
their delegated powers by re-appropriating
Government buildings at Delhi and Pune
Cantonments for non-bona fide purposes.

###### IV Works and Military Engineer Services Para 4.2 Poor planning resulting in suspension of work and damage to the Government property

Army acquired land worth `9.04
crore, without considering the provision for
approach road, resulting in suspension of
construction work after incurring `3 crore.


These assets sustained damages worth `37
lakh and necessitated preventive works
worth `1.87 crore.
###### V DEFENCE RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT ORGANISATION Para 5.3 Procurement in violation of norms by DRDO

Defence Research and Development
Organisation procured a critical component
required in production of ‘NAG’, missile
at a cost of `52.58 crore, in anticipation of
an order from the Army, which resulted in
blocking of Government money amounting
to `34.70 crore.
###### VI ORDNANCE FACTORIES ORGANISATION Para 6.4 Undue benefit to a foreign firm by diluting the conditions in tender Enquiry and contract

Ordnance Factory Badmal, in violation
of Defence Procurement Manual, accorded
undue benefit to a foreign firm by accepting
the PC sheets valuing `2.58 crore without
ascertaining its manufacturing month. This
coupled with delayed issue of PC sheets to
Ordnance Factory Chanda had resulted in
accumulation of shelf life expired PC sheets
valuing `0.67 crore.
###### Report No. 35 of 2014: U n i o n Government (Defence services) Army Ordnance Factories and Defence Public Sector Undertakings II MINISTRY OF DEFENCE Para 2.1 Inordinate delay in indigenisation of TATRA vehicles

In order to attain self reliance and


-----

effect savings in foreign exchange, Bharat
Earth Movers Limited, a Defence PSU, signed
a collaboration agreement for indigenisation
of TATRA vehicles in 1986 with M/s Omnipol
of Czechoslovakia to cater the continuous
need of the Indian Army. The objective of
attaining 86 per cent indigenisation by
1991 was envisaged by BEML. However, till
2014 the target is yet to be attained. BEML
attributed the delay mainly to the failure
of Ministry in placing order for sufficient
number of vehicles between 1986 and 1991.
The process for indigenisation of TATRA
vehicles suffered due to lack of clear long
term projection of orders by Army to BEML.
Resultantly, the objective of self-reliance in
production of TATRA vehicles was defeated.

###### Para 2.2 Procurement of unacceptable equipment valuing `27.32 crore

Ministry of Defence imported 999
number of Individual Chemical Agent
Detectors (ICADs) worth `27.32 crore
between January, 2010 and October 2010
for detecting the presence of chemical
agents and toxic industrial compounds.
Non Conducting Field evaluation Trails
in conditions where equipments is likely
to be deployed as prescribed by DPP, had
resulted in acceptance of defective ICADs
worth `27.32 crore. These equipment were
awaiting replacement since August 2011 by
the firm as of June 2014.

###### Para 2.3 Loss of revenue due to unauthorised use of Defence land by United Services Club, Mumbai

Failure of the Local Military Authorities
at Colaba and further lack of pursuance by
Defence Estate Department for obtaining


Government sanction for entering into a lease
for the defence land occupied by the United
Services Club, Mumbai resulted in recurring
revenue loss of `5.74 crore per annum to
Government exchequer. The MoD on their
part, failed to monitor the assurance given
to the Public Accounts Committee of the
Parliament to review the arrangements with
US Club which continued to commercially
exploit A-1 defence land valuing `114.85
crore without Government sanction and
paying a nominal rent of `0.36 lakh per
annum.

###### Para 2.4 Irregular construction on Defence lease land

Old Grant Bungalow measuring 4.56
acre at Kirkee Cantonment was leased for
residential purpose. Execution of an irregular
deed for reconstruction by Defence Estate
Officer (DEO) with Power of Attorney Holder
(POAH) and failure on the part of DEO
and Cantonment Executive Officer to take
appropriate action against the POAH/ Holder
of Occupancy Right facilitated the POAH
to illegally construct a Community Centre
which was misused for religious activities on
Defence land worth `22.14 crore.

###### III ARMY

 PARA 3.1 Nugatory expenditure of `88.39 crore in the procurement of Chemical, Biological, Radiological and Nuclear (CBRN) equipment

Injudicious planning by IHQ of
MoD, Army in the procurement of nine
items under Individual Protective Equipment
relating to chemical, Biological, Radiological
and Nuclear equipment, resulted in nonprocurement of NBC suit permeable, the


-----

main constituent of IPE. An expenditure
of `88.39 crore on other eight items of IPE
without addressing the compatibility issue
defeated the purpose of ensuring protection
in case of NBC Warfare.

###### Para 3.3 Loss of revenue due to non-collection of metal scrap from Field Firing Range

Despite instructions for collecting
metal scrap of fired ammunition from Field
Firing Ranges through hired civil labour in
case of non conclusion of regular contract
for the same, Army authorities failed to
collect metal scrap of 285 MT (approximate
quantity) worth `2.32 crore.

###### Para 3.4  Procurement of defective tyres

Army Headquarters incurred an
expenditure of `2.65 crore in procurement
of tyres despite the knowledge that the tyres
were manufactured with inferior quality
material.

###### Para 3.5 Over provisioning and uneconomical issue of Batteries by COD Agra

Over provisioning of batteries ‘A’
worth `7.16 crore during 2009 by Army
Headquarters led to uneconomical issue of
batteries ‘A’ worth `1.91 crore during 2013
against demands for low cost batteries ‘B’
and ‘C’ in order to liquidate the huge stock.

###### Para 3.6 Recoveries savings and adjustment in accounts at the instance of Audit

In pursuance of Audit observations, the
audited entities recovered overpaid pay and
allowances, sundry charges and recovered


electricity charges, cancelled irregular works
sanctions and amended annual accounts,
having a net effect of `68.01 crore.

###### IV Works and Military Engineer Services

 Para 4.1 Avoidable expenditure on construction of excess dwelling units

The failure of Local Military Authorities
at Chennai to correctly assess the requirement
of married accommodation for JCOs resulted
in construction of 17 dwelling units in excess
of the requirement at a total cost of `1.79
crore.

###### Para 4.2 Inordinate delay in handing over the clear site to the contractor resulted in avoidable payment of escalation charges.

Chief Engineer, Shillong Zone
concluded contract for construction of 13
Ammunition storage accommodations for
which GE Guwahati issued an inaccurate
certificate for availability of clear site. This
inordinately delayed the completion of
work leading to avoidable payment of extra
escalation charges of `4.58 crore over and
above normal escalation charges admissible
to the contractor for completion of work
within completion period.

###### Para 4.3 Selection of improper site resulted in foreclosure of work after an expenditure of `5.49 crore

Military Engineer Services and Local
Army authorities could not identify the
proper site at planning stage for construction
of other than married (OTM) accommodation


-----

for Army. This resulted in foreclosure of the
work after incurring expenditure of `5.49
crore.

###### V DEFENCE RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT ORGANISATION

 Para 5.1 Unauthorised utilisation of funds for construction of a Multipurpose Hall

Funds amounting to `0.93 crore
allotted for the construction of two storage
accommodations for two Border Road Task
Forces were unauthorisedly utilized to
construct a bigger Multipurpose Hall, with
an area of 1,556 sqm against the sanctioned
area of 489 sqm.

###### Para 5.2 Construction of a bridge without sub-soil investigation resulted in loss of `0.75 crore.

An expenditure of `0.75 crore incurred
on excavation in foundation for a bridge work
by Task Force under Chief Engineer (Project)
Pushpak without sub-soil investigation
as required under Codes of Indian Road
Congress resulted in loss of public money as
the site became landslide prone area which
could have been forewarned after sub-soil
investigation.

###### Para VI Project Management in Vehicle Research and Development Establishment, Ahmednagar and Combat vehicles Research and Development Establishment, Avadi

Audit scrutiny of the Staff and TD.R&D
projects taken up by CVRDE and VRDE
during the period April 1998 to March 2013
for delivery of products required by Defence
Forces revealed the following.


###### Staff Projects

AT CVRDE: Two staff projects were
closed during April 1998 to March 2013
out of which one project was undergoing
Transfer of Technology but was yet to be
productionised. In another project though the
system developed was accepted by the user,
yet the project could not be productionised
due to imposition of ban on the foreign
vendor.

At VRDE: Of the nine closed projects
during April 1998 to March 2013, only
one underwent productionisation. For
another project though stated to have been
successfully completed by the lab, the
details of acceptance by the user leading to
induction into Service could not be produced
by the lab. Third project partly achieved the
project requirement and the remaining six
projects could not achieve success in terms
of acceptance by the users.

Initiation of projects without firm
General Staff Qualitative Requirement,
failure of the laboratory to develop the
desired deliverables and defective planning
were the main reason for failure.

Technology Demonstration/ R&D
Projects

The status of Technology
Demonstration projects undertaken by the
two labs was also not encouraging as 36
out of 51 closed projects did not lead to
the utilisation of such technology in staff
projects.

###### Para VII Defence Grants-in-Aid Scheme of Defence Research and Development Organisation

The Defence Grants-in-Aid scheme
was instituted to utilize the indigenously
available research talent and facilities in


-----

IITs, Universities, Higher Technological
Institute, etc. for undertaking research and
development work on problems of scientific
value and preferably in areas of interest to
Defence. Audit observed that there were
critical shortfalls in the management and
monitoring of the Scheme such as awarding
the project without arriving at viable and
specific research objectives and not defining
the quantitative and qualitative targets to
be attained. The major expenditure was on
purchase of equipments but in majority of
cases the disposal of equipments was left at
the discretion of the Grantee institutions in
the manner desired. In these circumstances
the schemes is far from satisfaction. The
money was also sanctioned for creation of
basic infrastructure against the provisions of
the scheme.

###### VIII ORDANCE FACTORIES ORGANISATION

 Para 8.1 Performance of Ordnance Factory Board

The Ordnance Factory Organisation
comprising 41 Ordnance Factories (including
two ordnance factories under project stage)
with manpower of 96,317 is engaged in
production of arms, ammunition, equipment,
clothing etc. primarily for the Armed Forces of
the Country. The factories function under the
Ordnance Factory Board (Board). Revenue
expenditure showed 11 per cent increase
in 2011-12 but decreased marginally by
2 per cent in 2012-13. Stores (48 per cent)
and manufactured expenditure (36 per cent)
constituted 74 per cent of the total revenue
expenditure. Both components, however,
registered a dip in 2012-13: stores by 7 per
cent and manufacturing by 2 per cent.


Capital expenditure of `349 crore during
2012-13 remained almost at the same level
of 2008-09 and comprised only 3 per cent of
the total expenditure of the Board.

Of 529 items targeted for manufacturing
during 2012-13, Ordnance Factories
achieved success rate of only 31 per cent.
Inability to source quality components on
time and fluctuations in demands were the
reasons for the low success rate.

During 2012-13, the cost of production
(`15,972.44 crore) almost remained static
when compared with 2011-12 with share of
stores, Labour and Overhead cost of 61 per
cent, 11 per cent and 28 per cent respectively.
In eight ordnance factories, the percentage
of overhead to cost of production exceeded
50 per cent. High supervision charges, with
one supervisory officer for every 1.97 direct
labours, contributed to the high overhead.

During 2012-13, the Board reported an
increase of total receipts of `71 crore (0.56
per cent) over 2011-12. On the other hand,
surplus generated during 2012-13 fell by
`118 crore (16 per cent). Cross-subsidisation
across the products led to inadequate cost
control by the Board.

Revenue earned from exports reduced from
`46 crore in 2011-12 to `15 crore in 201213 (67 per cent).

###### Para 8.2 Inventory Management in Ordnance Factories

The Ordnance Factories held an inventory
of `10,490 crore (March 31, 2013)
which accounted for two-third of the
cost of production. Our audit covers the
performance of Ordnance Factory Board
and nine sampled Ordnance Factories in


-----

respect of Inventory Management in the year
2010-11 to 2012-13. The sampled Factories
together held inventory worth 4,799 crore
which represented 46 per cent of the total
inventory held in all Ordnance Factories as
of March 31, 2013.

Stores-in-hand (SIH) i.e. inventory of raw
material with the stores Section of the
Factory is an area of concern in inventory
management in the Factories. At the level of
`2,425 crore, SIH constituted over 50 per cent
of the inventory holding in the nine sampled
factories as of March 31, 2013. In the nine
sampled factories non-moving SIH i.e. items
which sere not consumed for a period of
three or more years after purchase, increased
by 73 per cent during 2010-13. Our analysis
showed that 95 per cent of the SIH in the
sampled Factories exceeded the prescribed
limits. Over four-fifth of these items held in
excess of the limits were items which were
not consumed at all during the year under
our analysis, 2012-13. Items worth `96 crore
were not only held in excess of the prescribed
holding limits but also had not been used even
once after their procurement during 2010-13.
The current procedure to exhaust all option
of potential usage had in effect failed and led
to build up of non-active stores. On the other
hand, the definition of “active” stores (an
item is categorised as active even if only one
unit is consumed during the year) creates a
potential risk of token consumption in order
to keep the items off the “non-moving”
category. All nine sample factories together
registered token consumption against 5,925
items valued at `373 crore, indicating a
common trend.

Works-in-Progress (WIP) are inventory held
by the Factory Production Shop, which are


under production. WIP in the nine factories
increased by 21 per cent during the period
2010-13 and as of March, 2013, the value
of WIP stood at `1,501 crore. The increase
in WIP without a correlated increase in cost
of production points to a risk of fraudulent
booking of material or labour against open
warrants i.e. warrants not closed although
production against them had stopped for
variety of reasons. Although warrants are
required to be closed within six months,
17 per cent of warrants of eight sampled
factories were over a year old. The value of
warrants that were open for more than one
year was `434 crore. The factories had been
reflecting rejected stocks as WIP or Stores-intransit between factories, in some cases for
over 20 years, which remained un-detected.
A protracted process for review of inventory
and to fix accountability for loss due to
rejections, let to a tendency in the Factories
to “hide” rejections by categorising rejected
stores under WIP or SIT even as delays in
fixing accountability defeated the purpose.

The assurance to be provided by the physical
verification was inadequate and did not
reflect the correct position on physical
availability of stores. The use of “loan issues”
of material without a demand note from the
shop does not have the sanction of Board
and constitutes a bad practice. The review
of inventory holding by the Board was not
comprehensive and did not yield clear and
firm directions to the Factories.

###### Para 8.3 Indigenous production of MBT Arjun and T-90 Bhisma Tank

Against the Ministry’s revised plan to induct
124 MBT Arjun in 2002-09, Ordnance


-----

Factories issued 119 MBT Arjun to the Army
during 2004-13. The production of 300
indigenous T-90 tanks, scheduled for delivery
in 2006-10 based on transfer of Technology
from Russia (2001), lagged behind with
production of 225 T-90 and issue of only
167 T-90 tanks to the army during 2009-13.
Inordinate delays in production of both the
tanks led to fresh import (November, 2007)
of T-90 tanks worth `4,913 crore. While the
progress of the project for augmentation of
production capacity of T-90 tanks sanction
in September, 2011 was very slow, the
existing facilities for MBT Arjun remained
underutilised in absence of further order of
MBT Arjun from the Army.

###### Para 8.4 Capacity addition in Ordnance Factories

Procurement of machinery in ten Ordnance
Factories (test checked) did not enhance the
production capacity as the availability of
machine hours showed a downward trend
from 683 lakh hours in 2010-11 to 639
lakh hours in 2012-13. Delays in receipt
of 170machines (36 per cent) valuing `343
crore and delays in commissioning of 213
machines (29 per cent) valuing `317 crore
deprived the Factories of the timely benefits
of modernisation. Deficiencies in predispatch inspection and pre-commissioning
trials led to delays in commissioning and
in some cases, acceptance of machinery
compromising the quality. High incidence of
under-utilisation (21 to 24 per cent machines
utilised upto 30 per cent of capacity) and
of breakdowns, affected the ability of the
factories to meet the targets placed on them.
These issues which have a direct bearing on
the performance of the Board, did not receive
focused attention of the top management.


###### Para 8.6 Avoidable extra expenditure on procurement of components

Procurement of Copper Tube/ Aluminium
Alloy extruded Rod by Ordnance Factory
Kanpur (OFC) from Ordnance Factory Katni/
Ordnance Factory Ambarnath, despite
material cost of those sister factories being
higher than the total trade cost, led to
avoidable extra expenditure of `3.99 crore.

###### Para 8.7 Avoidable extra expenditure on procurement of components

Acceptance of defective stores before receipt
of clearance for bulk production in violation
of the Ordnance Factory Board’s instruction
led to a loss of `93.61 lakh.

###### Para 8.9 Injudicious procurement  leading to uneconomical manufacture

Despite adequate stock of magazine
assemblies through inter factory demand, the
Rifle Factory Ishapore bought spring platforms
at a cost of `1.27 crore which was avoidable
and led to higher cost of production.

###### Para 8.10 Defective manufacture of mines

Manufacture of defective mines by Ordnance
factory Chanda/ High Explosive Factory
Kirkee coupled with their failure to seal the
joint properly led to segregating of mines
valuing `35.97 crore at Army Depots without
repair/ replacement.

###### Para 8.13 Undue benefit to a private power utility provider

Failure of the Board/ Gun and Shell factory
Cossipore to recover the lease rent and


-----

premium from the private electricity supplier
as per the prescribed rates resulted in revenue
loss of `2.64 crore and led to undue benefit
to the private electricity supplier.

###### IX DEFENCE PUBLIC SECTOR UNDERTAKINGS

 Para 9.1 Licence production of Su-30 MKI aircraft

Since the ageing fleet of MiG 21 series of
aircraft nearing completion of their total
technical life were to be phased out from
2000 to 2010, Ministry of defence (MoD)
directly purchased (1996 and 1998) 50 Su30 MK aircraft from the Russian Government.
An Inter-Governmental Agreement was
concluded (October 2000) with Russia
for transfer of licence and technical
documentation to India for production of
140 aircraft, 920 engines and 140 sets of airborne equipment.

Pursuant to this and considering the immediate
requirement, IAF ordered (January 2001) 140
aircraft from HAL in four phase composition
stipulating the deliveries upto 2017-18. HAL
in turn signed (December 2000) a General
Contract with Resoboronexport (ROE) for
facilitating licence production. In March
2006, considering the sharp depletion in
combat aircraft force levels and deliveries
were advanced to 2014-15 with changed
phase composition.

Based on IAF’s proposal seeking additional
40 aircraft as urgent requirement, another
order was placed on HAL considering its
request to amend the procurement from
‘buy’ to ‘make. Another order for supply of
42 aircraft was placed on HAL as a repeat
order to avoid depletion in IAF’s force levels
and to use ToT available with HAL.


HAL did not receive all the components of
transfer of technology from ROE as required
impacting the timely supply of deliverables.
Production of engines from raw material
stage scheduled from 2009-10 was yet to start
even as of December 2013. There was delay
in receipt of documentation for Repair and
Overhaul of Aircraft and engines resulting
in delay in setting up of facilities for Repair
and Overhaul. HAL procured inventory of
`1,725.41 crore in advance of requirement
due to non-synchronisation of purchase
production schedule. Delayed setting up of
Repair and Overhaul facilities for Aircraft at
HAL led to TBO life extension from 10 years
to 12 years by IAF.

IAF received 81 aircraft against 112 due till
2012-13 from HAL. This was due to delay
in receipt of technical documents and
rectification of defective toolings received
from ROE. There were delays upto 275 days
in ferry out of aircraft after signalling out
due to snag rectification. MoD recovered
liquidated damages of `96.26 crore from
HAL due to delayed supply of aircraft.
Though the delay was attributable to ROE,
HAL could not recover the same from ROE in
the absence of enabling provision. Further,
due to delayed conclusion of agreements
for role equipments with ROE, HAL could
not deliver the same in time resulting in
levy of liquidated damages of `4.77 crore
by MoD. Acceptance of a new rate by HAL
for procurement of engine kits disregarding
the price stipulated in the General Contract
of December 2000 resulted in additional
expenditure of `66 crore.


-----

HAL could not recover `66.61 crore in supply
of Ground Handling Equipment/ Ground
Support Equipment to IAF due to quoting
rates without reference to year of incurrence
and non-inclusion of escalation clause in the
contract with MoD.

Owing to adoption of incorrect exchange rate
by MoD, while amending the contract, HAL
incurred a loss of `101.72 crore in supply
of aircraft towards additional contract for 40
aircrafts.

Mandatory fatigue test of airframe was
not conducted on aircraft manufactured
indigenously from raw materials.

###### Para 9.2 Loss due to non utilisation of power for captive consumption

Non Utilisation of power generated by wind
mill farm for captive consumption and sale of
power to Hubli Electricity Supply Company
Limited (HESCOM) by BEML Limited at a price
lower than they paid to Bangalore Electricity
Supply Company Limited (BESCOM) and
Bhoruka Power Corporation Limited for
purchase of power resulted in loss of `5.67
crore.


###### Para 9.3 Non-recovery of liquidated damages

BEML Limited’s acceptance of nonenforceable terms of LD coupled with failure
to withhold the payments resulted in nonrecovery of LD of `12 crore.
###### Para 9.4 Loss of `9.81 crore in supply of ACEMU Coaches

Non-inclusion of Value Added Tax/ Central
Sales Tax in the offer for supply of Air
Conditioned Electric Multiple Units by
BEML Limited, resulted in non-recovery of
`5.51 crore and delayed supplies of coaches
resulted in payment of Liquidated Damages
of `2.99 crore. Further, the Company had
to absorb `1.31 crore being the excise Duty
paid for deliveries beyond stipulated delivery
schedule as the extension of delivery schedule
was with denial clause.

###### Para 9.5 Loss due to delay in procurement of material

Delay in procurement of raw material led to
non-recovery of price escalation of `15.52
crore and consequent delay in supplies
resulted in levy of LD of `1.47 crore on
Mishra Dhatu Nigal Limited.
