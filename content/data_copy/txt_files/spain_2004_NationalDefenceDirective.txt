## NATIONAL DEFENCE DIRECTIVE 1/2004

**0.** **BACKGROUND**

Since the transition to democracy, Spanish defence policy has evolved to

reflect the changes in the international strategic situation, Spain’s increasingly

important role in the world, the development of our society and successive

national governments.

This process has been guided by the successive National Defence

Directives issued in 1980, 1984, 1986, 1992, 1996 and 2000.

In the international area, these directives have guided us towards full

participation in the western security and defence organizations. In this way, we

have moved from a traditional concept linked to sovereignty seen in territorial

terms — with an almost exclusive focus on military aspects — to another,

broader concept of shared security and collective defence with our partners and

allies, in which society as a whole must be involved.

In the national arena, the directives have always included among their

objectives the improvement of the organic and functional structure of the

Ministry of Defence and the modernization of the Armed Forces, especially with

regard to the model, size, structure and operational capabilities of the forces,

and the combined nature of military operations.

On this occasion, the Government has submitted to the upper and lower

house of the Spanish Parliament the fundamental principles underling this

Directive and has incorporated a number of the comments made by the various

parliamentary groups.


-----

**1.** **THE STRATEGIC SITUATION**

The strategic situation at the beginning of the twenty-first century is

characterized by the fact that alongside the traditional risks and threats to

international peace, stability and security other, new risks and threats have

emerged, such as transnational terrorism with its global reach and its immense

capacity to inflict damage in an indiscriminate manner.

The attacks carried out in New York, Madrid and Beslan have made it

clear that, in the face of these new risks and threats, traditional military

superiority does not represent an effective deterrent nor can it any longer

automatically guarantee security. By the same token, it is unable to ensure the

effective prevention of terrorist attacks or avert the risk of the proliferation of

weapons of mass destruction, despite the fact that the possibility of terrorist

groups acquiring these weapons today poses the most serious threat to global

security.

Countering these new threats, specifically terrorism, is the key to the

strategy of international security and defence organizations. Europe too must

take a decisive stand against these threats and challenges if it is not to become

an easy target. In this effort, Europe can count on the explicit backing and firm

support of Spain, as one of its most committed partners.

For the first time in its history the European Union has taken on a

security strategy of its own. This strategy, however, requires greater resolve,

adequate resources and a more effective and coherent use of the instruments

at its disposal for crisis management and conflict prevention. These are

genuinely demanding requirements that no European country is capable of

meeting on its own.

The European strategy is based on a multilateral system of concerted

actions and initiatives within security and defence organizations, with the

possibility of carrying out early and rapid interventions and, if necessary,

powerful ones; a system based on the recognition that the United Nations


-----

Security Council has the fundamental responsibility for maintaining international

peace and security.

For its part, the Atlantic Alliance, of which we are a member and which

was the first organization to recognize the need to adapt traditional responses

to the new strategic situation, is immersed in a profound process involving the

transformation of its structures, procedures and capabilities with the aim of

making the allied forces better equipped, interoperable and capable of acting

with maximum efficiency.

We find ourselves, therefore, facing a new strategic situation in which

security policy demands fresh approaches and changes in mentality, especially

with regard to crisis management and conflict resolution and the need to adapt

the Armed Forces to the ever-changing circumstances.

All of this will have to be built into a new defence policy, which, like the

nation’s foreign and other policies, will contain elements of continuity and new

elements reflecting a change from the practices of past periods.

**2.** **THE FRAMEWORK OF SPANISH SECURITY AND DEFENCE**

In matters of security and defence, Europe is our area of priority interest.

We are Europeans and our security is inextricably linked to that of the continent.

Spain will promote and support an authentic European security and

defence policy, will back initiatives designed to achieve a common defence, and

will contribute to providing the European Union with the civil and military

capabilities required for active and independent intervention to prevent and

resolve conflicts and to contribute to the preservation of international peace and

security in accordance with the Charter of the United Nations.

If we are to do this, we shall have to be able to co-operate with certain

countries, should it be so decided, to develop more demanding military


-----

capabilities and to take on more binding commitments, within the terms

provided for in the Constitutional Treaty of the European Union.

This priority is compatible with a robust and balanced transatlantic

relationship, another essential element of European defence, as recognized in

the Constitutional Treaty itself. The allies on both sides of the Atlantic share and

defend the same principles and values. Spain is convinced that a strong Europe

does not weaken this relationship but, on the contrary, strengthens it.

In this respect, Spain is a firm and clearly committed ally within the

Atlantic Alliance and one that, in addition, maintains a close and strong

relationship with the United States of America — a relationship that must be

based on trustworthiness and dialogue and on mutual confidence and respect.

Similarly, the Mediterranean area is of special interest to Spain. As

regards security and defence, initiatives that facilitate dialogue and promote

bilateral co-operation with the countries of the Mediterranean region are

indispensable. We shall also support the multilateral initiatives of the European

Union, the Atlantic Alliance and the OSCE for the Mediterranean region.

Ibero-America constitutes another privileged area for Spain. The defence

policy will strengthen bilateral relations and, where appropriate, military

co-operation. In addition, we shall support regional initiatives designed to

increase multilateral co-operation between the countries of the Ibero-American

Community.

**3.** **THE SPANISH RESPONSE**

Spain’s external action must be based on scrupulous respect for

international law as a means of resolving conflicts and on the recognition of the

United Nations as the organization with responsibility for ensuring international

peace and security. Such action will also place emphasis on a more effective

use of all the political, diplomatic, economic and social instruments available to


-----

bring about the peaceful settlement of disputes and the prevention of conflicts

so that military intervention is contemplated only as a last resort.

Likewise, in order to contribute to spreading peace, security and stability

throughout the world, and especially in the light of the priority assigned to

combating terrorism, action by Spain outside its borders will be directed at

implementing our commitments to international organizations, such as the

European Union, the Atlantic Alliance and the OSCE.

As a result, the engagement of our Armed Forces abroad will take place

within a context of effective multilateralism requiring that two conditions be met:

first, that there be a prior decision by the United Nations or, where appropriate,

by another multinational organization of which Spain is a member and, second,

that the involvement of the Spanish Armed Forces be subject to the explicit

consent of Parliament. All of this must be without prejudice to the right of self
defence, whether exercised unilaterally or collectively, as provided for under

article 51 of the Charter of the United Nations and set out in the international

defence treaties ratified by Spain.

In view of the need to be prepared and able to respond to any

eventuality, the Spanish strategic concept will be based, on the one hand, on

the maintenance of a national defence capability as a deterrent factor and a

genuinely national response capability, and, on the other hand, on collective

defence and security shared with our partners and allies.

In order to face the new challenges, there is a need for new military

capabilities and structures and for new operating procedures. It will therefore be

necessary to undertake a process of reforming the Armed Forces and of

devising a realistic model for their professionalization in order that they may be

able to carry out effectively the missions assigned to them by the Government.

Similarly, in accordance with this strategic concept, we must determine to

what extent we wish to develop our military level of ambition; i.e., we must

define the effort that Spain is prepared to make to meet purely national


-----

requirements as well as our commitments in the field of shared security and

collective defence.

All of the above, alongside the fact that a new government is in office,

makes it necessary to issue a new National Defence Directive, which, in the

light of what has been said, will steer the development of Spanish defence

policy during the VIII legislative period.

**4.** **AIM OF THE DIRECTIVE**

The aim of this Directive is to establish the guidelines for defence policy

and for its development, with the objective of ensuring the defence of the

homeland, contributing to the security of the Spanish people and promoting

international peace, security and stability.

**5.** **GUIDELINES FOR ACTION**

Defence policy will be governed by the following guidelines:

1. The strengthening of the role of the Armed Forces as a relevant factor in

the external actions of the Spanish State;

2. The dynamic and constant reform of the Armed Forces so as to adapt

them to the circumstances and needs arising from the strategic situation

existing at any given time;

3. The implementation, in concert with our partners and allies, of our

commitments in the area of shared security and collective defence;

4. Firm and resolute support for an effective multilateral system as a means

of resolving conflicts, with full respect for the resolutions of the United Nations

Security Council;

5. The active participation of Parliament in the discussion of major issues of

defence policy and the seeking of parliamentary support for government


-----

decisions regarding the involvement of Spanish Armed Forces in operations

abroad.

**6.** **GUIDELINES FOR THE DEVELOPMENTS OF THE DEFENCE POLICY**

Defence policy will be developed in accordance with the following
guidelines:

**(a)** **In the international sphere:**

1. Resolutely support the common security and defence policy of the

European Union through our commitment to the Helsinki 2010 global

objective, our contribution to the development of Battle Groups, and our

participation in the European Capabilities Action Plan and the European

Defence Agency;

2. Participate actively in the initiatives of an enlarged and transformed

NATO, in particular in the Prague Capabilities Commitment and the

Response Force, with the aim of contributing to effective conflict

prevention and, where necessary, crisis management;

3. Strengthen relations between the European Union and NATO in the firm

belief that a solid, robust and balanced transatlantic link is a decisive

factor in achieving international peace and stability;

4. Contribute to increasing security in the Mediterranean region by

strengthening the Mediterranean dimension of the European Union’s

common security and defence policy, within the wider framework of the

Barcelona Process and the Mediterranean dialogue of the Atlantic

Alliance;

5. Foster a solid and balanced relationship with the United States

of America based on the Defence Co-operation Agreement and guided

by the objectives and aims of the joint declaration of 11 January 2001,

which, among other things, provides for political, scientific, industrial and

technological co-operation;


-----

6. Establish closer relations as regards security, defence and military

co-operation with the countries of the Ibero-American Community of

Nations;

7. Step up defence diplomacy by promoting mutual confidence with the

armed forces of countries in areas of strategic interest.

**(b)** **In the national sphere:**

On the organization of defence

1. Draft a new constitutional law on national defence. This law will set out

the tasks and assignments of the Armed Forces, establish the

fundamentals of military organization in conformity with constitutional

principles, define the essential principles that are to underlie the use of

the Armed Forces, and determine the way in which Parliament is to

express its decisions regarding the participation of Spanish Armed

Forces in military operations abroad;

2. Reorganize the Defence Staff by:

— Rationalizing the structure of the Joint Defence Staff;

— Bringing together the military intelligence services within the

Armed Forces Intelligence Centre and co-ordinating their activities

with the National Intelligence Centre;

— Initiating the work of the Armed Forces Operations Command for

the planning and conduct of operations;

— Setting up an Armed Forces restructuring body with the mission of

overseeing the reform of the structure, capabilities and military


-----

doctrine of the Armed Forces, with a view to increasing their

operational effectiveness.

3. Establish a joint rapid reaction force made up of highly trained units that

are available at short notice and that can be assembled very quickly for

emergency missions under the operational command of the Armed

Forces.

On the reform of the Armed Forces

1. Define the model of the Armed Forces, their capabilities, personnel

strength and the size of the forces and their support units in order to

make them more mobile and flexible and better suited for joint and

interoperable missions with the armed forces of our partners and allies;

2. Promote the reform of the Armed Forces in accordance with the new

model by equipping them with technologically advanced capabilities and

by structuring them so that they will be given a graduated response

capability;

3. Determine, with the approval of the Government, to what extent the

country wishes to develop its military potential during the current

legislative period; this will include determining the amount of resources,

their level of availability and the personnel strength needed to meet

national requirements as well as the number and scope of operations

abroad in which the Armed Forces are to be able to participate

simultaneously;

4. Devise a new and realistic model for the professionalization of the Armed

Forces that is in keeping with the characteristic features of Spanish

society, that is based on the skill and specialization levels needed to

meet the new technological and organic requirements of modern armies,

and that will promote a change in mentality enabling the forces to adapt

to their new missions;


-----

5. Determine the personnel strength of command staff, troops, naval

personnel and reservists in accordance with the armed forces model,

population forecasts and funding possibilities;

6. Reform the military profession by adopting a new structure for corps and

ranks, with systems for advancement and promotion that serve as an

incentive for dedication and professional effort;

7. Improve the equipment so as to enhance the operational effectiveness of

the Armed Forces, by completing armament programmes that are

already under way and initiating such other programmes as may be

necessary for the reform of the Armed Forces; a balance will be

maintained between the acquisition of new equipment and the

maintenance of current operational strength;

8. Encourage research, development and innovation so as to maintain an

high level of technology, thereby improving the operational capabilities of

the Armed Forces and promoting the competitiveness of the national

defence industry;

9. Maintain, during the current legislative period, a sustained budgetary

increase of an amount no less than the one experienced between 2003

and 2005, in order to provide a stable economic environment making it

possible to successfully accomplish the reform of the Armed Forces.

On co-operation with other organizations

1. Develop a new national system for crisis management to replace the

existing preventive defence system;

2. Achieve effective co-ordination between civilian and military personnel

participating in operations of humanitarian assistance, crisis

management and support for civilian authorities;


-----

3. Collaborate in the civil defence system and, together with other State

institutions, in particular the security forces and agencies, contribute to

maintaining security and welfare on the part of the citizens;

4. Raise the level of security and defence culture in Spanish society; to this

end, the Government, acting at the behest of the Ministry of Defence and

in co-ordination with other State agencies, will help to spread the

message regarding the role and importance of defence with the aim of

encouraging greater involvement by society and making possible the

exercise of the right and duty to defend Spain as provided for under the

Constitution.

**7.** **FINAL PROVISION**

1. The Minister of Defence is authorized to issue such specific guidelines as
may be necessary to implement this Directive.
