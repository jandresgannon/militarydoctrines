###### National Internal Security Policy - 2014 - 18

1. This first ever National Internal Security Policy (NISP) is formulated to protect

national interests of Pakistan by addressing critical security issues as well as concerns

of the nation. It is based upon principles of mutual inclusiveness and integration of all

national efforts and includes three elements _viz i) dialogue with all stakeholders, ii)_

isolation of terrorists from their support systems, iii) enhancing deterrence and

capacity of the security apparatus to neutralise the threats to internal security of

Pakistan. This requires integrated efforts through an institutionalized monitoring

framework under democratic leadership to elicit support and cooperation of local

and international stakeholders.

2. Global terrorism and armed conflict in Afghanistan have changed the

internal security paradigm of Pakistan. Pakistan’s economy has suffered a loss of

more than US$ 78 billion in last ten years only. More than 50,000 Pakistanis, including

civil, Armed Forces and law enforcement agencies (LEAs) personnel, were affected

or sacrificed their lives. This challenges the resolve and resilience of people of

Pakistan for peace.

**National Internal Security Environment**

3. Internal security environment is dominated by non-traditional threats of

extremism, sectarianism, terrorism and militancy. In present form, the internal security

apparatus is inadequately equipped and enormously strained to tackle these

threats. This elucidates the dire need for a comprehensive and inclusive response

plan, as no single state agency is capable of dealing with such threats on its own.

**Scope**

4. Whereas it is critical to define the composite picture concerning threats to

National Security, NISP essentially remains focused on Internal Security. National

Internal Security (NIS) paradigm, however, would be incomplete without identifying

Page 4 of 94


-----

its linkages with external diplomatic initiatives and various other dimensions of

human security. In some parts of the country hostile networks have also challenged

the writ of the state. Nonetheless, national security apparatus including Ministry of

Defence (MoD), is dealing with this situation under political oversight. Other, relevant

state institutions will address social, economic, environmental and external security

aspects.

**Vision**

5. Create a safe environment where life, property, civil liberties and socio
economic rights of the citizens are protected and the people of Pakistan are able to

live and prosper in harmony, freedom, respect and dignity as enshrined in the

Constitution of Pakistan.

**Threat Perception**

6. Pakistan is facing serious traditional and non-traditional threats of violent

extremism, sectarianism, terrorism and militancy. This has adversely affected

economic stability and social harmony, and continues to instil a sense of insecurity

among the people at large.

7. Subversive activities and a pattern of targeting the national security

apparatus and key installations by the terrorists and non-state armed groups have

compounded the challenge. Faced with the complexity of the situation, use of

chemical and biological substances by terrorist and non-state armed groups cannot

be ignored and MoD is equipped to deal with these extreme threats.

8. Terrorist networks lurk in shadows and thrive on a strategy of invisibility and

ambiguity. They operate in an ideologically motivated network of networks to

embroil the State on physical, psychological and ideological levels.

9. The widespread spectrum of internal threats is a critical impediment to

economic development and social cohesion. Traditionally, the entire internal

security apparatus acts in a reactive rather than proactive manner. In the absence

of an integrated internal security response, the terrorists are expanding their network

to the detriment of national integration and economic betterment of the people of

Pakistan.

Page 5 of 94


-----

**Policy Objectives**

10. To establish the writ of the state and protect the people from all internal

threats.

11. To protect the life, property and fundamental rights of the citizens of Pakistan.

12. To promote pluralism, freedom, democracy and a culture of tolerance.

13. To prevent, deter and contain threats to internal security in a transparent,

accountable and just manner.

14. To resolve and manage disputes with hostile elements peacefully without

compromising the rule of law.

**Policy Framework**

15. The soft component of policy framework outlines an integrated process of

research and coordination on key issues. It highlights primacy of the political

process, supported by a Comprehensive Response Plan (CRP). CRP is focused on

winning over trust and confidence of general public to combat extremism and

terrorism. The hard component of NISP comprises of Composite Deterrence Plan

(CDP). It complements the existing internal security apparatus to combat terrorism.

**Comprehensive Response Plan (CRP)**

16. CRP is a composite process based on dialogue with all sections of society. It

includes infrastructure development, Rehabilitation of victims of terrorism, National

Narrative Reconciliation, Reintegration and Legal Reforms. All these encompassing

elements of social, economic, and ideological domain require utmost attention and

careful execution.

**_Reconstruction_**

17. Terrorism has not only affected the socio cultural environment but it has also

damaged the scarce existing infrastructure in Pakistan by way of frequent attacks

on educational institutions, healthcare facilities, communication networks, and

supply of energy within the country. NACTA will coordinate with all relevant

agencies for fair assessment of losses, monitor and recommend plans for securing

the infrastructure.

Page 6 of 94


-----

**_Rehabilitation_**

18. Sustainable and integrated development for rehabilitation of affected

regions is fundamental in collaboration with respective Provincial Governments.

Though such efforts are already in place but need vigorous follow up for timely

implementation and quick impact. It will also ensure that victims of terrorism are

provided sufficient support through similar programs.

19. Towards this end, enormous support of various public and international

organizations is available, but requires synergy and improved communication.

NACTA will analyse the shortcomings of planning and execution and recommend

appropriate strategies in this process. An integrated evaluation and monitoring

mechanism shall be established within NACTA to coordinate the process of

rehabilitation.

**_National-Narrative_**

20. Constructing a robust national narrative on extremism, sectarianism, terrorism

and militancy is the corner stone of an ideological response to non-traditional

threats. Such a narrative is essential for coming up with common ideological

denominators in a diverse society. Religious scholars, intelligentsia, educational

institutions and media are the key stakeholders for constructing and disseminating

the National Narrative. NACTA will facilitate a dialogue with all stakeholders to

strengthen democratic values of tolerance respecting diversity of the society.

21. NACTA in consultation with other institutions supporting NISP will develop a

National De-Radicalization Program.

**_Reconciliation_**

22. NACTA will devise strategy options in consultation with experts and relevant

departments for peace building with extremist elements and terrorist groups opting

to submit to lawful authorities and reconcile their differences on key issues within the

legal framework.

**_Reintegration_**

23. The reintegration aspect of CRP is a holistic people centric process. This has

direct bearing on economic security of the citizens and it needs an integrated

24. First, it envisages a Youth Engagement Strategy (YES) imparting technical and

vocational education, creating jobs and offering soft loans in collaboration with

respective Provincial Governments to ensure decent livelihood opportunities for all.

25. Secondly, this reintegration also envisions the incorporation of madrassas in

the mainstream educational framework. Understanding the critical role played by

these institutions for a pluralistic society, it is important to integrate them within the

national educational system by supporting their administration, financial audit and

curriculum accreditation. The same applies to other private sector educational

institutions.

26. NACTA will conduct research and consultations to come up with an

implementation strategy and road map to fill the gaps in the existing process taking

along all stakeholders, educational institutions and other relevant provincial and

federal authorities.

**_Legal Reforms_**

27. Implementing of NISP requires a comprehensive review of existing legal

framework. This reform process will respond to imperatives of criminal justice and

ensure the protection of fundamental rights of the citizens of Pakistan. Among other

reforms in criminal justice, it also requires review of the regulatory capacity of the

state to monitor, evaluate and prevent the misuse of existing laws under which

mosques and madrassas are functioning.

28. NACTA will conduct detailed research and consultation with relevant

stakeholders including Ministry of Law & Justice, Judiciary, Police, prosecution,

prisons and legal experts to recommend a futuristic legal framework capable of

addressing all contingencies of NISP.

**Composite Deterrence Plan (CDP)**

29. The National Internal Security Apparatus (NISA) suffers from inadequacies to

identify the threat, analyse it, and respond quickly at all tiers. Best practices suggest

that CDP would remain elusive without synchronization of national efforts and

democratic oversight.

Page 8 of 94


-----

30. Despite all material constraints the overall performance of law enforcement

agencies is inconsistent and needs improvement. CDP will provide a consistent

approach through integration of specialized skills and capabilities to combat

traditional and non-traditional threats to internal security. This needs restructuring

and capacity building of NISA on urgent basis for enhanced service delivery of

justice and security.

31. NISP aims at performance enhancement of existing apparatus and filling the

capacity gaps of NISA by creating new but cost effective and efficient institutions.

CDP seeks to change the posture of national internal security apparatus from

reactive to proactive. The immediate objective is to eliminate growing menace of

terrorism by, inter alia, filling the coordination gaps in intelligence regime to develop

proactive systems.

32. While tackling non-traditional security threat, it would be imperative to

address traditional threats by using conventional law enforcement apparatus more

effectively. Towards this end, identification and mapping of critical security threats

to public is essential to articulate a response strategy under a unified command and

control.

**Contours of NISP**

33. The contours of response mechanism of NISP hinge upon the major activities

under taken by various stakeholders implementing the CRP and CDP.

34. Construct a national narrative on extremism, terrorism, sectarianism and

militancy to dispel the wrong perceptions created by the terrorists on ideological

basis by engaging media, civil society organizations, overseas Pakistanis and

international community to elicit support and cooperation.

35. Design and implement national de-radicalization program for the people

vulnerable to extremism that can be rehabilitated and reintegrated in the society.

36. Integrate the mosques and the madrassas in the national and provincial

educational establishment by mapping and thereafter mainstreaming the existing

and new madrassas and private sector educational institutions.

Page 9 of 94


-----

37. Develop social and physical infrastructure in terrorism-affected regions

through sustained and inclusive efforts by all state institutions at federal and

provincial levels.

38. Rehabilitate all victims of terrorism especially vulnerable groups like women,

children, elderly, minorities and people with special needs.

39. Improve worsening law and order situation by eliminating trends of targeted

assassinations, extortion, kidnapping for ransom and other serious and organized

crime.

40. Ensure protection of key installations and places of national importance.

41. Enforce a comprehensive arms control regime across the country.

42. Prevent misuse of social, electronic and print media; mobile phone Sims and

electronic devices, and prevent cyber crimes for any purpose threatening internal

security.

43. Integrate national database and registration plan to identify people residing

in Pakistan and their assets.

44. Design and implement plans to regulate lawful movement of Afghan

refugees within the country.

45. Enforce a robust border control regime to interdict illegal cross border

movement of persons, goods, drugs and precursors, weapons or any other material

threatening internal security.

46. Capacity building and modernization of all pillars of Criminal Justice System

including judiciary, police, prosecution and high security prisons in all geographic

entities of Pakistan.

47. Establishment of Directorate of Internal Security (DIS) under NACTA where

thirty three civilian and military intelligence and operational agencies are

represented having clear articulation of command and control by integrating all

grids of tactical, operational and strategic intelligence, civil and military, under one

roof.

Page 10 of 94


-----

48. Capacity building of DIS for collection, analysis and dissemination through

integrated qualitative intelligence gathering efforts having direct bearing on Internal

Security to develop operational capability of conducting ‘Intelligence Based

Operations’ to contain, pre-empt and eliminate terrorism and other threats to public

safety.

49. Establishment a modern, well-equipped Federal Rapid Response Force (RRF)

comprising of Counter Terrorism Departments and Police with experts from other

security institutions with nationwide reach and capability to interface and operate in

close coordination with Police, CAFs and Pakistan Armed Forces.

50. Reorganization and activation of Counter Terrorism Departments (CTD) within

Police organizations of all the Provinces, Islamabad Capital Territory, Federally

Administered Tribal Areas (FATA), Azad Jammu and Kashmir and Gilgit-Baltistan,

preferably with uniform structure and unified command at provincial, regional and

field level.

51. All CTDs to comprise of intelligence, operations, investigations, Provincial

Rapid Response Forces (RRF) and other technical sections enabling themselves to

tackle the entire spectrum of internal security threats including terrorism and

subversive activities.

52. Modernization of RRFs under CTDs with matching capabilities as that of

Federal Rapid Response Force (RRF) for ensuring uniformity.

53. Establishment of a dedicated CAF headquarter under MoI for integrated

border management and modernization and coordination of CAFs, i.e. Pakistan

Rangers (Punjab and Sindh), Frontier Corps (Khyber Pakhtunkhwa and Balochistan),

Frontier Constabulary, Gilgit-Baltistan Scouts, Pakistan Coast Guards, and Anti
Narcotics Force.

54. Modernization of law enforcement components of Pakistan Customs besides

Levies in FATA and Balochistan and other LEAs.

55. Making concerted diplomatic efforts for international cooperation to break

transnational affiliations of terrorists through prevention of money laundering,

Page 11 of 94


-----

organized crime and transnational movement of substances used in biological and

chemical terrorism.

**International Cooperation**

56. NACTA will liaise with international actors for fostering cooperation to counter

terrorism and extremism.

**Policy Directives**

57. Peaceful resolution of disputes with all the sections of society is the cardinal

principle of NISP, through dialogue from a position of strength.

58. Ministry of Interior (MoI) is the lead ministry for National Internal Security Policy

implementation.

59. For NISP implementation, all CAFs will be directly responsible to MoI.

60. Each ministry, organization, intelligence agency and department shall furnish

such information and intelligence as solicited by NACTA and shall clearly outline and

pursue a roadmap in support of NISP within 30 days.

61. Incentives will be available for specialized functions at all levels for the

organizations dedicated to NISP implementation.

62. Restructuring of Ministry of Interior, Police and CAFs and other LEAs will be

undertaken to rationalize their mandate and resources to implement the NISP

framework. Whereas all the existing well functioning structures will remain intact, any

overlapping and/or redundant units in Police and CAFs will be integrated to fill the

gaps in the relevant organizations.

63. Political consensus for NISP will be solicited through consultative process with

all the stakeholders.

64. Public support for NISP will be solicited through all communication channels.

Valuable suggestion and input from intelligentsia, media and CSOs will be invited by

NACTA for improvement in the NISP and mid course corrections where needed.

###### Executive Summary

Global terrorism and armed conflict in Afghanistan changed the internal

security paradigm of Pakistan. The economy suffered a loss of more than US$ 78
billion in last ten years only. More than 50,000 Pakistanis, including civilian, Armed
Forces and Law Enforcement Agencies’ (LEAs) personnel, have been affected. This
situation requires integrated efforts through an institutionalized framework under
democratic leadership to elicit support and cooperation of local and international
stakeholders.

1. The first National Internal Security Policy (NISP) of Pakistan is formulated to

protect national interests of Pakistan and addresses critical security issues and
concerns with an institutionalized response through National Counter Terrorism
Authority.

2. It is based on the principle of mutual inclusiveness and integration of all

national efforts and includes three elements;

a. Dialogue with all stakeholders,

b. Isolation of terrorists from their support systems,

c. Deterrence enhancement by capacity building of the security

apparatus to neutralise threats to internal security of Pakistan.

3. First element of NISP, dialogue, includes a comprehensive approach to deal

with all segments of society from citizens to adversaries. The government will
take steps to address the ideological and material aspects of internal security
of Pakistan.

4. It will ensure protection of basic rights of the people and will focus on

reconstruction, rehabilitation, victim protection to building a national
narrative on extremism and terrorism with the help of all stakeholders.

5. For isolating those who do not want to see Pakistan as a prosperous and

progressive state, a robust border management framework will be put in

Page 19 of 94


-----

place to secure borders of the country. It will also require concerted
diplomatic efforts to build international support and cooperation for desired
results.

6. Whereas peaceful resolution of all disputes is the first priority, it is also vital to

develop a deterrence capacity to neutralise all threats to national internal
security. Capacity building of Police and Civil Armed Forces is the corner
stone of this policy.

7. NACTA to comprise of two directorates for implementing soft and hard

components of NISP. Directorate of Research and Coordination will work on
national narrative, rehabilitation, reconstruction, rehabilitation, integration,
mosques and madrassa mapping, legal reforms and policies related to
internal security.

8. NISP also envisages filling existing gaps in coordination and intelligence

sharing by establishing a Directorate of Internal Security within the existing
legal framework of NACTA. Directorate of Internal Security will disseminate
proactive plans for intelligence based upon operations with all components
of national internal security apparatus.

9. The implementation of NISP will require an estimated cost of 32 billion rupees

and it will be implemented till December 31, 2014. Provincial component of
this estimated cost is Rs. 22 billion and Rs. 10 billion is estimated cost of federal
components though it will be also supporting the provinces. Timely
implementation of NISP will help in proactively dealing with threats to internal
security.

###### Introduction

After the maiden peaceful democratic transition of power in the history of Pakistan,
the first formidable challenge for the newly elected government is internal security.
Aspirations of the political government to deliver results for betterment of people of
Pakistan based on principles of good governance cannot be realised without
changing the present security situation which is result of multiple factors over a long
period of time. It is a precondition for economic recovery and resolving the energy
crisis with the help of local and international support. This can be achieved by
integrated efforts of all stakeholders and setting realistic targets and timelines. It is,
therefore, in the best national interest of Pakistan to give a clear direction to civilian
and armed forces security institutions and other stakeholders by presenting a
progressive National Internal Security Policy (NISP) (p. 4) and NISP Implementing Plan
(NISPIP)(p. 13) by the political leadership.

This concept paper outlines, inter alia, the internal security environment, a synopsis of
existing internal security apparatus and way forward in the forms of National
Counter Terrorism Authority (NACTA) to address the traditional and non-traditional
threats to internal security and stability of Pakistan (Annex A).

###### Scope

National Security aspects need a comprehensive approach to deal with full
spectrum of internal and external concerns to the state. However, this paper focuses
on Internal Security which is a critical aspect of human security of the people of
Pakistan. It is also pertinent to mention that in some parts of the country hostile
terrorist networks have also challenged the writ of the state. National security
apparatus of the state, in which Ministry of Defence (MoD) has a critical role, is
dealing with this situation on a short-term basis under the political oversight. Other
strands of human security like social, economic, environmental and external security
need dedicated attention and remain out of the scope of this paper.

###### Threat Perception

1. Global terrorism and armed conflict in Afghanistan have changed the

internal security paradigm of Pakistan. The country is facing serious traditional and
non-traditional threats of violent extremism, sectarianism, terrorism, and militancy in
addition to worsening crime situation in urban areas. Continuous presence and influx
of approximately 1.64 million Afghan refugees is a key factor for arms proliferation
and a strain on limited resources of the country (Annex B)1.

2. Terrorist networks lurk in shadows and thrive on a strategy of invisibility and

ambiguity. They operate in an ideologically motivated network of networks to
embroil the state on physical, psychological and ideological levels. Keeping in view
global terrorism and facing the complexity of the situation in Pakistan, use of
chemical and biological substances by terrorist cannot be ignored and MoD is
equipped to deal with these extreme threats.

3. Pakistan is the most affected country by terrorism in the world, after Iraq2. If

the severity of the incidents is considered, then Pakistan even surpasses Iraq3 (Annex
**C). From 2001 to 2013, there were 13897 incidents in Pakistan which is marginally less**
than Iraq (Annex D). From 2001 to 2005, there were 523 terrorist incidents in Pakistan
but since 2007 to November 2013, the total number of incidents has risen to 13,198.
During the year 2013, there have been 1361 incidents of terrorism. A trajectory of
terrorist incidents in Pakistan shows that after Marriott bombing in Islamabad and Lal
(Red) Mosque incidents the number suicide attacks in Pakistan increased alarmingly
(Annex E). From 2001 to 2007, there were only 15incidents in Pakistan but since 2007
to November 2013, the total number of incidents has risen to 358, which is highest
than any other place in the world4. Another lethal trend is use of Improvised
Explosive Devices (IEDs) against the LEAs and it has emerged as a ‘weapon of
choice’ of terrorists5.

4. Direct consequence of terrorism is irreparable loss of human lives. More than
50,000 Pakistanis were affected or lost their lives due to these terrorist attacks3. The
terrorists have indiscriminately targeted children, women, elderly people and
minorities. Armed Forces personnel and members of Police and LEAs have been
martyred and maimed.

5. So far, 5272 Armed forces personnel and Police officers have laid their lives in

the line of duty across the country (Annex F)3. Majority of them were front line
soldiers, first responder constables and officers from all ranks6 who sacrificed their
lives to protect their homeland. Religious minorities, foreign tourists and people
belonging to other ethnic communities have been targeted by the extremist
elements. Non-sparing policy of terrorists targeted, students, journalists, educationists,
doctors and even health practitioners of polio campaigns (Annex G). This has also
resulted in indirect causalities which cannot be estimated so for in any reliable
database. These sacrifices speak volumes about the resolve and resilience of
people of Pakistan for peace.

6. Pakistan’s economy has suffered a loss of more than US$ 78 billion in the last

ten years3. Non-traditional threats have posed serious challenges of governance
and provision of basic services to the people in remote and undeveloped areas.
Subversive activities and a pattern of targeting the physical infrastructure, national
security apparatus and key installations by the terrorists and Anti-state armed groups
have compounded the challenge. As part of their obscurantist policies a number of
mosques belonging to various sects, schools, colleges, bridges, electric supply lines
and police stations and the military posts have been destroyed by subversive
activities. Besides, deprivation of livelihood opportunities for poorest of the poor,
health hazards and psychological trauma of all sections of society are incalculable
losses.

7. Combinations of socio economic factors and demographic changes have

adversely affected the quality of governance (Annex H). Economic stability,
sustainable development and social harmony are adversely affected, and have
resulted in an alarming increase in crime and security threats to the people at large
(Annex I). Organised crime including drug trafficking, money laundering, human
trafficking and smuggling are common and multinational gangs and mafias are
exploiting technological advancement to further their aims.

8. In recent years, a surge in sectarianism is alarming. There have been various

incident of sectarian nature in Quetta, GB and other parts of the country (Annex J).
Overlapping of sectarianism and terrorism is partly due to the recruitment patterns of
the terrorist organisations and ideological underpinnings. The terrorists’ networks are
becoming a Frankenstein with the help of growing ideological convergence of local
terrorists, sectarian extremists, foreign fighters and the financial support from local
and international accomplices. Although the Government has taken steps to
proscribe certain organisations but implementation gaps and metamorphism of
these organisations remains a challenge for the National Internal Security Apparatus
(NISA) (Annex K).

9. Terrorists are trained in spreading fear through propaganda. They run hate

campaigns designed and implemented through various channels of

communication including videos, brochures and social media. In the absence of
cyber crimes prevention legislation7, the legal response remains confined to limits of
Pakistan Electronic Media and Regulatory Authority (PEMRA) which has limited
capacity and role in checking the illegal activities on electronic media.

10. Religious rhetoric is used to motivate the young people to commit suicidal
missions. Many political leaders were assassinated in such attacks[8]. The narrative of

extremism revolves around the religious discourse and is presented, to comparatively less
educated people, with great zeal and primitive logic. Many scholars are afraid to
challenge the archaic views of extremists and some of them have been martyred for
speaking the truth and exposing the fallacy of terrorists’ narrative.

11. The education system of Pakistan needs structural overhauling and it is

regarded as one of the least effective systems in the world with deplorable physical
infrastructure9. Less than half of the women have never attended school10. At
structural level, parallel systems of education in terms of elite private schools,
government schools and religious seminaries were liable for development of strata in
a society that fails to find any common bonds. These parallel structures open
different avenues for graduates of respective streams and breed disharmony and
grievances. Serious cleavages have appeared in the society as a result of these
systems and continued existence in parallel spheres compounds the possibilities of
violence among divided youth.

12. The madrassa, as an institution of education, has a long history and tradition

in Pakistan and the subcontinent. It is important to mention upfront that not all
Madrassas are a problem and therefore these must not be viewed negatively as a
whole. In local environment most of them are exceptional non-governmental
organisations engaged in provision of food and shelter to children who cannot
afford expensive education (Annex L).

13. However, there were problems within some madrassas, which have spread

extremism. There are some troublesome aspects of these madrassas, which impinge
on national internal security, include financing from unidentified sources; publication
and distribution of hate material. Overtime not only have they dated curriculum but
some of them have also taken a dangerous turn in cultivating non-tolerant and
violent religious attitudes. Lack of employment opportunities for students of these
madrassas can cause frustration and make such youth vulnerable to prejudices and
polarisation, which can lead to extremism11. Earlier, it was limited to madrassas for
boys but Jamia Hafsa incident has brought madrassas for women also under the
microscope of security analysts. Mostly these madrassas operate outside the ambit
of the government specified structures.

14. Social harmony and national integration of Pakistan are the prime targets of

extremists, terrorists and separatists. The concept of ‘radicalisation’ literature in
madrassas, wherein the complete rejection of other beliefs and sectarian
indoctrination plays a critical role in dividing society and adding emotive fuel to
existing divisions in the society. Also a large number of terrorists, either are, or have
been students of madrassas where they were brainwashed to take up arms against
the state. Therefore, madrassa and mosque remains and important point of focus for
any government policy to stem the spread of violent extremism in Pakistan.

15. Amidst these internal security threats, there is a lot of talk about talks. Hostile

anti state elements like Balochistan Liberation Army (BLA) and terrorist organisations
like Tehrik-i-Taliban Pakistan (TTP) and affiliated groups keep dialogue as an option to
settle their disputes with the state, prima facia. Whereas it seems a noble idea to
proceed on a non-violent path, it also creates confusion in the minds of the foot
soldiers and police officers how to respond to suspected elements. Moreover,

Page 28 of 94

without holding a strong position in negotiations, it is difficult for any party to reach
at a favourable conclusion.

###### Threat Scenarios

16. This internal security environment and threat spectrum may lead to following

scenarios.

I. **Leading Scenario. Internal threat gradually weakening national**
political, economic and psycho - social power potential.

II. **Dangerous Scenario. Continuous internal weakening for shaping**

environment for external aggression, or posing an existential threat to
the integrity and sovereignty of State.

###### Internal Security Environment

17. Pakistan is a diverse country and the nature of internal security environment

also varies substantially from one part of the country to the other. Approach of the
terrorist in the country has depended on the comparative advantage available in
the specific location of their operations. In Federally Administered Tribal Areas
(FATA), Khyber Pakhtunkhwa (KP) and Balochistan proximity of Afghanistan and
presence of Taliban has made them ideal targets and abodes for terrorists. In
Punjab, Sindh and other parts of the country the focus has been more on urban
centres through various tactics ranging from suicide attacks to targeted killings and
IEDs implantation (Annex M). Analysis of Ministry of Interior, National Crisis
Management Cell, indicated that during 2010 – 2013, terrorists largely targeted
seven agencies of FATA, Karachi, Peshawar, Kohat, Bannu, Hangu and Swabi
districts of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa and Quetta, Dera Bugti, Turbat and Kech districts of
Balochistan with 2,820 terrorists Incidents. This also defines the locus of terrorism in
Pakistan (Annex N).

18. It is hard to draw lines among traditional threats like organised crime,

kidnapping for ransom and non-traditional threats like terrorism, sectarianism,
extremism, militancy and insurgency under Taliban and Al-Qaida networks (Annex
**O). In Balochistan, in addition to terrorism, another critical factor is limited influence**
of anti-state elements in the Baloch majority districts. Amalgamating, subnational
movements with sectarian terrorism, people belonging to the Shia sect and the
Punjab are targeted along with the security personnel. Similar to terrorism trends in
KP, boundaries of terrorism, sectarianism, militancy and organised crimes also
merge, apparently, for political aims in Balochistan. These Anti-State elements have
even created problems during humanitarian relief campaigns in the aftermath of
recent earthquake in Balochistan12. In addition, drug trafficking and unmonitored
cross border movement on western border remains a challenge despite the heavy
presence of NATO forces in Afghanistan.

19. Karachi attracts attention being the economic hub of Pakistan. It is locus of

urbanised crime and political violence in Sindh. Political violence is claiming lives of
the people and armed members of political parties are behind the unrest in the city.
In first eleven months of 2013, the death toll has risen to 2600 which means one
person dies in every three hours due to violence13. Government of Pakistan has
taken immediate steps through an integrated action with the help of the provincial
government, Police and Pakistan Rangers Sindh. Other big cities like Lahore,
Rawalpindi, Faisalabad, Gujranwala, Multan, Sukkur, Hyderabad, Peshawar, Quetta,
and Islamabad are also attracting people and urban population is increasing.

20. In addition to the four province, it is the responsibility of the federal

government to manage the internal security situation of three federating units;
Islamabad Capital Territory (ICT), FATA, Gilgit-Baltistan (GB) and State of Azad
Jammu and Kashmir (AJK). Other than Islamabad, three territories have adjoining
international borders with Afghanistan, China and a Line of Control with India
respectively. Therefore, the critical linkages of internal security with external security
planning are very important. GB is also gaining importance as a hub of trade
prospects anticipating development of the Gawadar Port. Sectarian terrorists are
particularly targeting GB. Historically, these were low criminal activity areas. AJK
remains a terrorism free zone in Pakistan.

###### Capacity of National Internal Security Apparatus (NISA)

21. One important output of this exercise of NISP is comprehensive mapping of

internal security apparatus. There are thirty three (33) organisations in Pakistan at
provincial and federal level dealing with internal security. Total strength of these
agencies exceeds 600,000 and it is more than standing army of Pakistan. However
approximately 56,000 vacancies are still lying vacant in Police and Civilian Armed
Forces (CAFs) (Annexes P & Q). Pakistan is spending approximately Rs. 155 Billion on
Policing every year and this is seventy six per cent increase since 2009 (Annex R).
Extra expenditures have also incurred on maintaining CAFs and other LEAs deputed
for NIS purposes.

22. Law enforcement capacity of state has been put to test to counter militancy

at times, however, it has not always managed to succeed against the terrorists. In
Khyber Pakhtunkhwa the police was attacked in District Swat and CAFs were
rendered ineffective in some of the tribal areas. The need for a military operation
clearly underlined the inability of civil institutions to deal with the problem in these
areas as well as exposed the scale of threats to internal security. In other parts of the
province police has demonstrated some exceptional individual acts of bravery.

23. In Punjab the police have not faced a similar level of pressure primarily

because of the nature of the terrain and the fact that, unlike KP, it neither abuts with
the tribal belt nor any borderland communities living on the peripheries of the

Page 30 of 94


-----

province. However, attacks within urban centres, especially, have been extremely
ferocious and well organized.

24. The metamorphosis of crime accompanied by non-traditional challenges has

prompted Law Enforcement Agencies to realign their preparation and posture
accordingly. In those parts of the country which are less affected, the police have
generally maintained the traditional model of policing. In Khyber Pukhtunkhwa (KP)
and Balochistan the police forces have gone into an operational mode with other
important areas of police work being relegated to back seat. Currently police
training in these provinces mostly revolves around the tactical sphere14.

25. The Police Rules 1934 describe no ratio between number of police officers
assigned for population in rural and urban areas[14]. It guides that in towns where the

population exceeds 30,000 one constable is prescribed for every 450 citizens (see
Police Rule 2.2(2). The situation on ground in Pakistan is most favourable in ICT with
one policeman for every 114 citizens followed by Balochistan (1:223), Gilgit-Baltistan
(GB-1:234), KPK (1:411), Azad Jammu and Kashmir (AJK-1:467), Sindh (1:504) and
Punjab (1:514). However, in the 21st century this is not the only yardstick to determine
the human resource requirements of a modern Police department in Pakistan.

26. The armed forces have been successful in ‘clearing’ the captured territories

by the terrorists. The army met with serious resistance and has had to face losses. The
military operations in Swat and South Waziristan have removed any doubts about
the inability of terrorists to withstand a well coordinated attack in open areas.
However, the armed forces’ capacity beyond ‘clear’ remains a major question
mark. The security apparatus has been unable to demonstrate other capabilities
essential to successful counter-insurgency: hold, build and integrate. For the latter
three effective civilian follow up capacity is required. Unfortunately it has appeared
inadequate so far.

27. Pakistan has a large number of Civil Armed Forces (CAF) as an intermediate

arrangement between Armed Forces and Police to complete the paradigm of
increasing response to internal security threats as well force multipliers in case of
external aggression. The CAFs, now operating under Ministry of Interior with
established linkages with Pakistan Armed Forces, have rarely been employed in a
lead role like their present deployment in Karachi. They have specific capacity and
dedicated resources and following further capacity building, utilization of CAFs
inclusively and efficiently becomes more important.

28. Various civil and military intelligence agencies have been working in the

domain of internal security however, they do not follow the same processes for
intelligence management and sharing. By far, quality of military intelligence is
superior to civilian agencies. This differential stems from resource allocation for the
same purpose in both the organisations and working patterns and culture of civilian

Page 31 of 94


-----

and military organisations explains it further. However, there is no integrated
mechanism for civil-military intelligence sharing on internal security threats.

29. The internal security paradigm relies on a legal system which needs

continuous improvements. Despite international support, the physical infrastructure
and legal framework needs overhauling to pose an adequate response to internal
security threats. However, this is not limited to criminal procedure code, Pakistan
Penal Code, The Evidence Act or other regime of Anti-Terrorists Acts (Annex S). It also
requires a solid framework that ensures accountability of the state institutions by the
citizens and guarantees protection of their civil liberties.

30. On top of this internal security environment, the proverbial absence of a

consolidated data bank, and poor analytical base makes the task even more
difficult for policy development in any arena. In the absence of an integrated
internal security response, space between terrorist and the terrorized is continuously
shrinking besides fuelling societal fault lines. The non-traditional threats, as a
consequence, have also inspired insurgency of ethnic, political, economic and
sectarian in nature, thus confronting the challenges of war by proxy, subversion and
worsening law and order situations.

###### Situational Analysis

31. The origin, evolution and relative strength of each internal security threat is

different. Therefore for the formulation of a coherent national internal security policy,
each one of them has to be understood and analysed in its own context. At close
examination one finds that all internal security threats have been seen through the
prism of external political dynamics and overlooked the declining capacity of the
state institutions and poor governance.

32. All categories of the terrorist groups in Pakistan have hierarchical leadership,

organisation and multiple sources of funding. They have weaved a religion based
narrative and have carved out a domestic support base through which they
operate. One important feature that all of them share is more troublesome: all of
them have foreign connections of varying degrees with the external adversaries of
the state. Some of them, like the radical Islamists like the TTP, have transitional
affiliations and support networks along faith and ideological lines.

33. The groups and organisations, which are involved in one from of political

violence or another, have proliferated in the country over the past three decades.
They are ethnic-subnational, sectarian and religious-radical in character. Even, some
political entities which contest elections and speak the language of constitution and
democracy have created armed wings. They use them for politically motivated
target-killings and territorial turf battles in some parts of the country.

Page 32 of 94


-----

34. Pakistan’s response to counter terrorism has primarily been reactive since all

these years. Armed forces, intelligence agencies, CAFs and LEAs have been the key
organisations employed by the state to neutralise the internal security threats. Each
one of these has played critical role and lost personnel, martyred in the struggle
against terrorism. The result has been clearance of large area under control of the
TTP in Swat arrests of many terrorists and foiling of various plots of terror against the
state. In the absence of these efforts the state of Pakistan would have been under
much greater threat.

35. Total reliance on armed forces and law enforcement agencies to counter

terrorism is a major weakness in the counter terrorism response by previous
governments. A more comprehensive approach to counter terrorism and insurgency
remains a necessity. Moreover, Police and other civilian LEAs require additional
budgetary allocation for modernisation. Modernisation includes skills development,
process management and application of technologically advanced gadgetry in
NISA.

36. There is no forum for coordination between NIS operational and intelligence

agencies in Pakistan. There has been a deficit at various levels: across provinces,
within law enforcement agencies and among intelligence agencies. Provincial
coordination remains non-existent and even interrogation methods vary across
each province. There is no process for cross learning or sharing pre-emptive or
investigation methodologies.

37. Information sharing and analysis remains a weak area. While some

information does get shared individually, there is no institutionalized mechanism at
provincial or federal level. The provincial law enforcement agencies do not
coordinate with each other and even within each province a standardized
information sharing and coordination mechanism across districts remains elusive. The
second level of coordination weakness remains across the various intelligence
agencies of civil and military organisations.

38. Criminal Justice system is ill equipped to deal with the internal security threats.

Inability to successfully prosecute cases of terrorism remains a matter of serious
concern (Annexure T). Also, the absence of basic investigation and case
preparation skills in Police results lack of convictions by the courts.

39. There is trust deficit between the people and public institutions and due to

fear of reprisals people are not prepared to become witnesses in cases of terrorism.
At times police officers encourage people to come to court as witnesses but they
do not depose in the absence of state protection. Very recently some witness
protection bills are introduced in the provinces but their effective implementation
remains questionable. Similarly, the compensation for victims of terrorism is
inadequate.

Page 33 of 94


-----

40. Terrorism financing goes unchecked. In the past, a critical failure has been

the inability of the governments to plug sources of financial support to the terrorists
and extremists. These sources appear as a support system to some public welfare
and disaster relief organisations used by extremists. Certain purportedly charitable
organisations are a ‘nexus between organised crime and extremists’. No major
structure, or strategy, of the state exists to undertake this task. However, this
government has already taken concrete steps and promulgated laws to counter
terrorist financing.

41. State has been unable to respond to the ideological discourse of the

extremists and Media has been the only conduit for any alternate views but these
too have focused more on the acts of the terrorists instead of their ideological
discourse and the inherent threat to the society and the state. While there has been
no coherent response from the state there have also been no measures to block
various options used by the terrorists to propagate their views. The failure includes
inability to stop or counter internet based campaign of the militants and also
prevent spread of their literature which is easily available all over the country with no
counter narrative presented by the state.

42. Pakistan is still waiting for a coherent response to counter terrorism, extremism,

sectarianism and militancy. Any effort at this point in history by civil and military
leadership to develop an integrated response to protect national interests is _sine_
_qua non. For this, civil society, media, intelligentsia and faith leaders need to join_
hands with the elected representatives and NISA. Only then, this NISP shall bring
change and hope.

###### International Cooperation

43. In the post-2001 era, the international community has viewed Pakistan as a

key ally to counter terrorism and extremism. Pakistan has been among the leading
recipients of international assistance Post 9/11, however, counter terrorism related
aid to Pakistan was not commensurate to make up the losses incurred.

44. Other than the US, Narcotics Affair Section (NAS), Serious Organised Crime

Agency (SOCA) and United Nations office on Drugs and Crime (UNODC), DFID UK,
United Nations Development Program (UNDP) and GIZ are working with LEAs and
are involved in the capacity building of NISA. Turkish government is also taking a
keen interest in this arena and assisting in the developmental process of CTD in the
Punjab (Annex U).

45. There is a dire need to coordinate all these efforts at federal and provincial

level to avoid duplicity of efforts and evaluate the impact of these trainings. There

Page 34 of 94


-----

are twenty four Memoranda of Understanding (MoU) being signed by government
of Pakistan but their potential is not fully realised. Pakistan values the indigenous
capabilities to design local training plans for strategic benefits.

###### Global Counter Terrorism Models

46. A realistic analysis of the situation will inform that a comprehensive response

to the present internal security threats is the need of the hour. It is a formidable
challenge for a newly elected government who is facing huge challenges of
governance at an unprecedented scale. The range of internal security threats varies
from street crimes to nuclear terrorism. In order to opt for an appropriate response, it
is prudent to examine the existing global models of counter terrorism efforts in other
countries of the world. A comparative analysis is provided in (Annex V). Again,
before reaching any conclusion, it should be understood, that it is mandate of the
elected representatives of the state to define the determinants of National Internal
Security Policy. Before defining the main elements of the NISP, it is important to have
brief overview of the Internal security apparatus (Annex W).

Page 35 of 94

###### National Internal Security Framework (2014-18)

47. Pakistan is facing formidable internal security challenges. Political leadership

and military commanders have expressed their resolve to tackle this challenge with
full vigour. It should not be construed that external threats have disappeared, but
compared to internal threats from multiple actors, they are relatively manageable
and can be addressed through military deterrence and diplomacy and the people
of Pakistan have full confidence in the capability of Pakistan Armed Forces.

48. Failures, mistakes, domestic and foreign disorientations of the past decades

are no excuse for escaping responsibility for addressing the challenge of internal
security at this point in time. Not taking on this challenge is not an option; rather the
new democratic government considers it a primary responsibility. Independent
experts believe that wide range of internal security threats at the moment present
an existential threat, and if not addressed in time, these would continue to hold
peace and progress a hostage. These threats have already retarded economic
growth, prosperity and social harmony. The country cannot afford to deal with this
threat in a reactive and disjointed manner anymore.

49. Reason and history inform that terrorism and extremism cannot subjugate the

will of the free people; while the terrorists meet their natural end, states survive all
traumas and travails. The objective is to restore internal peace and stability by
creating a national atmosphere free of threats, intimidation, fear and violence.

50. This calls for creating a moderate, tolerant and a harmonious society; giving

hope to citizens and re-establishing trust between the individual and the state. It can
be done by reforming and restructuring the state institutions, forces, laws and
policies created for the purpose of internal security. The vision is to make Pakistan a
progressive and a developed state capable of delivering basic services to people
of Pakistan, and establishing writ of the state and rule of law (Annex X).

51. This maiden NISP is formulated with a determination and resolve that Pakistan

can and must eliminate all internal threats and challenges by employing all
necessary and relevant means. This would include dialogue, social and economic
development and use of force where necessary and appropriate.

52. The NISP brings clarity of responsibility with accountability. In worst security

situations, Armed Forces will come and CLEAR the area. After that for HOLD purpose,
Civilian Armed Forces will join and take over to assist the Police and Levies to BUILD
and restore the writ of the state. In peace times, Police is the lead agency to detect,
arrest and prosecute the criminals. Courts will have a constant check that all actions
and policies are according to the law of the land. However, the overall
accountability mandate lies with the democratic leadership who will give a
direction to the National Security Apparatus and elected representatives are

Page 36 of 94


-----

accountable to people of Pakistan who have given them this mandate to protect
the fundamental rights of the people and bring peace in homeland.

53. Inclusiveness, integration, human rights and gender mainstreaming are core

themes of NISP under political oversight. It is imperative to reiterate that respect for
life, liberty and dignity of all human beings is enshrined in the article 9 and article 14
of the constitution of Pakistan and Government of Pakistan is committed to
implement these highest principles in all its policies. Similarly, without participation of
women and young people, any policy in Pakistan cannot succeed. They are the
future of Pakistan and vision of NISP can only be realised with the participation of
present and future leadership of the country.

54. NISP framework envisages immediate measures and strategies that will stem

the tide of terrorism, weaken it and eventually defeat it. Medium term policy
initiatives will address structural issues that have contributed to the evolution and
growth of extremism, radicalism, militancy and use of violence as a political
weapon. Contours of NISP (p. 9) outline key measurable actions for NISA. These
actions range from a thorough arms control regime to consolidation of database of
all residents in Pakistan from internal security perspective. There are three elements
of this NISP framework: Dialogue, Isolation and Deterrence.

###### Dialogue

55. Dialogue offers political means to end internal disputes but this is not the only

option, though it is the most preferred way to bring peace and reconciliation. Doors
are open for negotiations with all anti-state and non-state groups within the limit of
constitution and without compromising the primary interests of the state-territorial
integrity and sovereign of the state. Political leadership has a consensus on dialogue
option as the unanimous resolution of the All Parties Conference reflects15. This
mandates and empowers the Government to engage with the militant groups.

56. Dialogue, however, should not be taken in its literal sense only. The

government will negotiate with all sections of society through an agenda of
development, rehabilitation, reintegration and reconciliation. The government will
make concerted efforts to work out all differences and settle the disputes
peacefully. The government will make flexible and pragmatic choices about who
will lead and represent the Government and which agencies, experts and
stakeholders will assist this process. Government of Pakistan expects the negotiating
process to be productive and meaningful and not a time gaining tactics by the
hostile elements.

57. In present time of free media, narratives have great power to influence all

segments of society including children and young people. There is also a need for
countering propaganda of the terrorists that rests primarily on imagined grievances,

Page 37 of 94


-----

exaggerated accounts of victim hood and irrational justification of use of violence.
Narratives weaved by groups sympathetic to extremists and terrorists have harmed
society by incentivising intolerant attitudes and creating a comfort social abode for
such elements. Using national reach of the media, public opinion can be formed
against the terrorist groups by showing how they have damaged the national
culture and values of tolerance and why they are enemies of the people and the
state.

58. There is a need to develop a National Narrative based on tolerance,

harmony and right of the people to make religious, political and social choices.
Respect for diversity, humanity and service to mankind and national duty to protect
the homeland are some of the values that will shape this national narrative.
Constructing a robust national narrative is an essential part of this dialogue with all
sections of society.

59. This will also lead to de-radicalization programs applicable in the local

context with the help of the most suitable institutions and experts. There are
examples of reintegrating extremist and violent persons in Swat. Pakistan Army has
developed and applied an organic, national model of de-radicalization. The model
programme of instruction combined with skill-development was very supportive in
purging out radical ideas from the minds of terrorists, juveniles and women. The
same model with further improvisation and refinement will be replicated in other
specified areas of the country. De-radicalization programmes will be conducted in
jails for prisoners and convicts of terrorism.

60. Poor infrastructure in terrorism affected areas needs immediate improvement

and reconstruction. Similarly, victims of terrorism, without any discrimination of
gender, religion, age and ethnicity, also need rehabilitation. Development connects
the state with its citizens. However, human development includes social, economic
and personal security and progress. Through this process of dialogue, all these
aspects as well as legal rights and civil liberties of the people of Pakistan will be
guaranteed.

61. The 15–29 year olds form 28 per cent of Pakistan’s population–defined as the

youth cohort. Between 2006-07 and 2008-09, this cohort increased by 1.8 million. The
need to provide education, health and livelihood for the growing youth population
will now increasingly become important16. The youth describes terrorism as one of
the top issues of Pakistan (Annex Y). If these young people are not provided with the
opportunities for progress, they will be unable to play a positive role. Under Youth
Engagement Strategy (YES), Prime Minister’s Business Loans program for youth will be
implemented to attract the young people towards positive activities and prevent
them from joining the terrorist organisations. Young people will be provided with soft
loans, skills development opportunities and professionals will be encouraged
towards entrepreneurial avenues.

-----

62. The madrassa system cannot be excluded from the internal security

parameters of the country. All madrassas derive their inspiration from some specific
sect. It appears that the madrassas are in competition to proliferate for more
influence and power.

63. There were various efforts made to streamline the registration of these two

critical institutions, which are the main source for poorest of the poor for obtaining
affordable “education” and shelter. So far all the efforts have been restricted to
quantitative aspects. It is critical to bring these institutions in the mainstream and
establish them as functioning bodies without external and unregulated funding. NISP
will include broad based madrassa and mosque integration process in the
mainstream education system so that students and alumni of these institutions can
also become active members of a plural society and play a positive role in the
national economy being part of a productive workforce.

64. There is also another reason for their horizontal expansion: the incentive of

raising funds in the name of a madrassa locally and receiving covert funding from
foreign sources. Sectarian and terrorist groups of the country receive funds through
formal as well as informal money transfer channels. Controlling funding of the
terrorists is a major challenge especially when the curriculum in these madrassas
does not prepare the youth for the job market. By involving banks, Federal Board of
Revenue and taxation departments for monitoring flow of money to suspected
organisation; it is expedient to implement the laws to tighten control over foreign
funding to non-governmental organisations and madrassas to distinguish between
the legal and illegal flow of money.

65. One of the priorities of the Government is to amend laws, enact new laws,

development of better prosecuting mechanism and create a secure environment
for judges, prosecutors and witnesses to enable our anti-terrorism legal and judicial
procedures to be strong and effective enough to handle the menace of terrorism. In
this respect, this government has already taken some useful steps. These include,
amendments in Anti-Terrorism Act (ATA) 1997 and the Investigations for Fair Trials Act
and rules 2013 (IFTA). The most recent addition is The Protection of Pakistan
Ordinance 2013 and 2014 that aims at facilitating effective prosecution (Annex Z).

66. In an uncertain and fluid climate of terrorism with so many groups and forces

involved, legal regime must remain adaptable. The Government and the parliament
is alive to the need of revising existing laws and writing new ones to be able to cope
with the prevailing state of terrorism. Convicting individuals for their crimes is
universally accepted as an effective mean of deterring and discouraging more
crime in the society. Under this policy government will continue to examine efficacy
of laws and judicial process and make necessary changes when and where
required.

###### Isolation

67. It is the first and foremost responsibility of the state to safeguard the core and

fundamental rights like life, liberty and property of the citizens. The purpose of this
policy is to protect the nation, entities, social groups and individual citizens, their
assets and freedoms from harm by violent, militant individuals, groups and
organisations. Isolating the terrorists group socially, legally, economically and
politically remains the prime function of all internal security apparatus locally as well
as diplomatic channels at international level. By target hardening, it will be
impossible for the terrorists to accomplish their designs.

68. A long porous border with Afghanistan has become a major security

challenge. National internal security arrangements will continue to fail without an
effective and practical border management regime. This will include biometric
system, identity papers and visa system for Afghan groups that are not covered by
old agreements.

69. In this direction establishment of CAF HQ is the way forward to improve

coordination among CAFs and brining them under the umbrella of a Pakistan Border
Service but keeping the existing traditions intact under MoI.

70. A comprehensive plan will be prepared to create more effective system of

their documentation as refugees, and steps will be taken to confining them to
specific areas and zones in the country. NACTA will coordinate to prepare a timebound repatriation framework for Afghan refugees.

###### Deterrence
71. It is to acknowledge that till present day, Pakistani Police, CAFs, LEAs and

Armed forces have performed their jobs on the frontlines and thousands of them
have sacrificed their lives for protecting the homeland. Government of Pakistan
pays tribute to all those men and women who embraced martyrdom for this noble
cause. Although dialogue is the cardinal principle of NISP but it is important to start
negotiations from a position of strength by improving the deterrence capability to
address present and future threats to national internal security.

72. There is no sectoral mapping of critical infrastructure-food, water, agriculture,

health, energy, transportation, information, telecommunication and national
monuments. Mapping up these sectors will help us identify and prioritize the
structures for ‘hotspot policing’. This would help the Government in hardening
targets, reducing vulnerability and preventing terrorists’ attacks.

-----

###### Capacity Building of Criminal Justice System

73. In the absence of a well functioning criminal justice system comprising of

police, prosecution services, high security prisons and probation departments and
courts, it will be naïve to expect that mere modernizing the Police, LEAs and the
military intelligence agencies will neutralize the internal threats. People of Pakistan
also need better security services and justice in their everyday life. It is critical that a
holistic approach is adopted to improve the service delivery. Resources will be
dedicated for this purpose and respective departments will be able to improve their
performance and capabilities.

###### Capacity Building of Police

74. Police is the largest and premier law enforcement agency in Pakistan and the

foundation block of NISA. This will be the primary objective of NISP to modernise and
organise the Police to make it service oriented and people friendly. Appropriate
budgetary allocations and filling of 42000 existing vacancies in the Police all over the
country is a priority. Besides capacity building of operations, investigations,
intelligence, highways and traffic police; the monitoring and evaluation capacity of
working of local police stations is highly desired. Establishment of specialised units
and people oriented working environment in Police departments is the only way
forward.

75. For proactive security measures, quality intelligence collection and

dissemination will be the main weapon against preventing, countering and fighting
terrorism in the country and maintaining peace. The policy rests on bottom-up
approach in intelligence gathering, starting from the local level. Presently, their
capacity, skills and resources are inadequate to handle the terrorist threats. Local,
district to provincial level Police personnel (CTD and Special Branch) must have
resources to ensure comprehensive intelligence management systems. Police will be
provided with modern gadgetry, skilled and qualified human resources at all levels in
all provinces.

76. Another aspect of Police reorganisation is re-examining all the efforts toward

reforms and restructuring and what is cumulative experience in this respect, and
what best measures can be taken for future reforms. The Police system of every
province is functioning under different Police Acts but somewhat uniform judicial set
up. That might be in the nature of federalist system, but for the sake of harmony and
in view of the fact that traditional and non-traditional threats are growing, a uniform
and coordinated response needs uniformity in Police Laws and enforcement
procedures. NACTA will make policy recommendation in this aspect.

Page 41 of 94


-----

###### Capacity Building of CAFs and Other LEAs For Border Management

77. Deficiencies and weaknesses of the Police and CAFs have increased reliance

on the Inter-Service Intelligence (ISI) and Military Intelligence (MI). This has
overburdened them and may reduce their efficiency and effectiveness for strategic
national security issues. Some part of their resources will remain committed to
internal security but that should not be a substitute for the essential work of civilian
intelligence agencies and LEAs. All have a significant role in NIS and have functional
autonomy within their own hierarchical structures. Capacity building CAFs and other
LEAs including Pakistan Customs and Airport Security Force is an essential element of
NISP and each agency will make detailed action plans for implementation of NISP.

78. Traditionally, Civilian Armed Forces (CAFs) are not trained and equipped for a

protracted action against the terrorists in addition to their border management
duties. They have to play the role of second responders after police and the state
relies on their capability. As last resort, under the constitution, the Military can be
called in support of the civilian authority but practicing this excessively will be
counter productive. Rebuilding all the CAFs elements with a view to enhance their
capacity to meet the current and future challenges of terrorism is a viable option.
The CAFs are in the federal domain and can provide assistance to the provincial
governments, when required.

79. The clarity about command and responsibility of CAFs whether deployed on

regular border management duties or when deployed for aid and services to the
provinces, is necessary. Marking down clear jurisdictional boundaries of command
and responsibility will increase efficiency and coordination between the federal and
provincial governments for result-oriented performance of CAFs. Therefore,
establishing a CAF headquarter headed by a senior officer under MoI will improve
policies, processes and coordination mechanism between CAFs and other
stakeholders.

###### Directorate of Internal Security (DIS)

80. Intelligence coordination among all the civilian and military intelligence

agencies is one of the most important tasks under this policy. For this purpose under
Section 4(a) of the NACTA Act Directorate of Internal Security (DIS) will be
established at the federal level. For the intelligence to be an effective tool against
the present security challenges, it must be capable and integrated at tactical,
operational and strategic levels. Its full integration and utility is possible only under
one central command, in one place and hierarchy of power to direct and
supervise.

Page 42 of 94


-----

81. Thirty three (33) civil and military operational and intelligence agencies will

contribute centralised intelligence sharing and dissemination to NISA. The DIS will
integrate the intelligence community that will work towards a common purpose of
neutralising threats to Internal Security by sharing information and intelligence. In
many ways the DIS will prevent duplication of efforts by intelligence agencies and
pool their resources for better and effective use. All intelligence agencies will be
bound to provide any intelligence solicited by NACTA.

82. One of the tasks of DIS will be to provide early warnings to LEAs and other

specific recipients with regard to violent-terrorist groups and organisations. A through
analysis of the objectives, organisational strength, ideologies, human assets,
operational networks, sources of funding and leadership of terror networks is
necessary for the intelligence agencies and government to shape its responses. The
analysis of intelligence data sets by DIS will help in assessing and forecasting violent
trends in the society as they emerge. Without threat analyses and proactive action
plans, utility of DIS would be limited.

83. An experienced and a well-reputed Director General shall head the DIS. The

officers and personnel of the DIS will come from IB, MI, ISI, MoI, FIA, CAFs, and
provincial Police, CTDs and from specialized fields of public and private sector on
fixed term basis.

###### Intelligence and Analysis Centre (IAC)

84. The DIS will have one Intelligence and Analysis Centre (IAC), Planning Center

and Operation Center. IAC comprises of four intelligence groups replicating the
intelligence agencies-ISI, MI, Federal LEAs and Police intelligence departments. IAC
will be headed by one of the heads of four groups, in addition to his own duties, on
rotation basis

85. Each group in IAC will get information from relevant field units, collate and

analyse at one place by sharing the connecting pieces with other agencies. Each
group will have five further specialised teams head by one Team Leader and two
Research Analysts from respective organisations leading the cell:

I.  Anti State Groups

II. Non-State Armed Groups

III. Armed Wings of Political Parties

V. Criminal Gangs and Organised Crime Mafias

86. In addition, specialised sub-units will be established under respective group in

IAC. For example, Federal group of IAC will be comprising of following teams:

I. Cyber Crimes

II. Border Control and Immigration

Page 43 of 94


-----

III. Financial Trails and Money

Laundering IV. Organised Crimes

V. Interpol Coordination and International Cooperation

###### National Internal Security Operations Centre (NISOC)

87. National Internal Security Operation Centre (NISOC) is the hub of information

and intelligence collection from all human, technical, covert and overt sources of all
agencies. It will share this information and intelligence with relevant groups. Refined
intelligence from Intelligence and Analysis Centre (IAC) of DIS will also be
disseminated through NISOC.

88. For improved coordination with field units, Provincial and Federal Police and

CTDs personnel will be managing the NISOC.

###### Operation Planning Centre (OPC)

89. There will be one Operation Planning Center (OPC) where heads of four

intelligence groups, Chief of Operations of DIS and DG DIS will prepare and plan
operations. Execution of all these operations will be contingent to agreement of field
units who have specific mandates and legal authority to conduct operations,
investigations and prosecution as per existing laws of the land. DIS will be
coordinating and supporting all such possible integrated operations.

###### Counter Intelligence Team (CIT)

90. DG DIS will also assisted by a lean but effective Counter Intelligence Team

(CIT) to protect the intelligence process of internal security.

91. Like any effective intelligence organisation DIS will require continuous

retraining of its personnel and re-equipping in terms of software and hardware that
all modern agencies do to stay ahead of the enemies. All Police, LEAs and CAFs
intelligence units will have to go through proper professional analysis of strengths
and weakness to fill the gap in resources, training and equipment in order to
develop their full capacity to counter and eliminate violent-terrorist networks.

###### Rapid Response Force (RRF)

92. The RRF will be the premium Counter Terrorism force of the Federal

Government and it will complement the CTDs all over Pakistan. Provincial CTDs will
also develop their RRFs on the same model.

Page 44 of 94


-----

93. The Rapid response Force (RRF) is conceived as a commando force unit to

be deployed in the field at a very short notice to handle high-risk situations. This
Force will respond to real-time incidents of terrorism and also pre-empt any terrorist
attack by conducting Intelligence Based Operations.

94. This force being specialized and task-oriented will be trained and provided

with combined arms capability. The fighting equipment and gear for this Force will
be according to international standards. The first batch of RRF will be quickly
organised and deployed by drawing 500 persons of professional skills from Military,
Police and CTDs.

###### Air Wing (AW)

95. Presently, the Air Wing (AW) in MoI, with international support, is providing

service to a number of CAFs and provinces for internal security purposes. The
available Air Wing aircraft resources are inadequate for the task assigned to the
FRRF. Presently, the AW has three Cessna and fourteen helicopters. All these assets
have night-flying and airborne operations capabilities. The Force will need eight
additional helicopters, and at some point, additional and improved aircrafts that
some of the friendly counties are willing to provide.

96. To fully develop and equip the AW, there is a need to increase the numbers

of existing aerial assets, aircrafts and Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAV), and create
more field facilities. In addition to the three operational airfields in Islamabad, Lahore
and Quetta, four existing airfields can be utilised at Kohat, Bahawalpur, Fateh Jang
and Ormara. These facilities will bring the entire country under operational cover of
RRF.

###### Public Support

97. Success of NISP will depend on how people of Pakistan will respond to this

framework and come forward to play an active role for saving present and future
generations from the menace of terrorism, extremism, militancy and sectarianism.
This is the key to winning the war against extremism and terrorism.

98. An effective communication campaign will be of utmost importance and

NACTA will be making all efforts to take NISP to all stakeholders and construct
positive public opinion through integrated efforts. However, this is only possible if all
key pillars of the state are prepared to develop a unified narrative and support
each other for building a better future for the People of Pakistan.

Page 45 of 94


-----

###### Way Forward - NACTA

99. NISP visualizes NACTA as the central institution in combating non-traditional

threats of terrorism and extremism to internal security. It is a statutory authority that
will function in all relevant areas of policy formulation, strategy and implementation.

100. Headed by the Prime Minister, Board of Governors of NACTA approves the

policies and Minister of Interior plays a critical role in the implementing process as
head of Executive committee in addition to his role as member of the Board of
Governors.

101. In NACTA, government will create necessary capacity to develop an

integrated and unified response to terrorism and extremism to protect its national
interests. Lack of coordination and unified response has been a major weakness in
our efforts to counter terrorism and extremism. The Authority will ensure coordination
among all relevant departments and structures of NISA.

102. NACTA will be an organisation with civilian command, integrated tasks and

capacity to guide the NISA to strike against the targets. In this respect, the Authority
will work as a think-tank for the federal government to produce policy
recommendations, monitor and supervise policy implementation, and concurrently
provide support to intelligence-based operational departments at federal and
provincial level. Although every element of NACTA is based on learning, experience
and appropriate to national environment, but it also draws conclusions from
international best practices and consultations with various experts and policy
institutions.

103. The Authority will carry out, among others, the following four core functions:

I. Integrating NISA for intelligence sharing and operational purposes to
proactively neutralise threats to internal security of Pakistan from

terrorist and extremist elements.

II. Communication with provincial governments, intelligentsia, media,

private industry and general population about threats and necessary
response preparedness.

III. Preparing capacity building plans, coordinating and equipping the

NISA through their respective operational units.

IV. Communication with all sections of society and other stakeholders

including international donors to elicit their support in implementation
of NISP.

104. Early last year, through promulgation of the NACTA Act-2013, NACTA has

been conceived to be a focal organisation for coordinating Counter Terrorism
efforts in Pakistan (Annex AA). After due process of deliberation and examination,

Page 46 of 94


-----

the ‘National Internal Security Policy-2014-18’ has been developed and would be
placed before the Board of Governors of NACTA for final approval. The NACTA has
prepared a detailed organisational set up to implement the NISP which will be
presented to the first meeting of its Board of Governors for approval (Annex BB).

105. For Dialogue element of NISP, NACTA will have a Directorate of Research and

Coordination (DRC) which will oversee the implementation of the soft component of
NISP. In order to counter the discourse of the terrorists, a national narrative based on
values of peace, tolerance and inclusiveness, will be developed and disseminated
in the society. Similarly, while evolving counter terrorism measures, mosque and
madrassa remains an important focus. NACTA will coordinate and make necessary
plans to combat non-traditional threats to internal security of Pakistan.

106. For _Isolation and_ _Deterrence implementation of NISP, NACTA will have an_

integrated grid of tactical, operational and strategic intelligence under the Director
General of DIS. This would generate actionable intelligence, leading to precise
intelligence based operations (IBOs).

107. Rapid Response Force of Federal Government and Counter Terrorism

Departments of provincial police would be in a lead role during execution of joint
operations. The required manoeuvrability, for such operations, would be provided to
RRF by the Air wing facility. Necessary surface support would also be available in
order to realize the objectives of such ‘Intelligence based operations’ through CTDs
and police.

108. Chief of Staff will be responsible for coordinating all policy and

implementation issues of NACTA. The COS would head Principal Staff Office of
NACTA and act as coordinator for supporting wings of the NACTA. He will oversee all
financial, administrative, policy, training and media communication aspects of
NACTA through directors of NACTA. COS enhances organizational operations,
internal and external communications, keep functions orderly and focused, allowing
executives to better focus on issues of strategic importance to the organization.

109. The implementation of NISP will require an estimated cost of 32 billion rupees

and it will be implemented till December 31, 2014. Provincial component of this
estimated cost is Rs. 22 billion and Rs. 10 billion is estimated cost of federal
components though it will be also supporting the provinces.

110. With the public support and cooperation of state institutions, timely

implementation of NISP will help in proactively dealing with threats to internal
security of Pakistan.

###### Annex S: Counter Terrorism Laws in Pakistan

**1.** **The Anti-­­Terrorism Act 1997 – Provides broad definition of terrorism. Established timelines**
for investigation and trial with specific tenure of judges. Amendments were introduced to
make the law more pragmatic abiding the courts by the same procedural rules of regular
courts. Appeals were to be made to respective High Courts and ultimately Supreme Court thus
disbanding the special Appellate Tribunals. These amendments disallowed a parallel judicial
system. The ATA 1997 has been amended 22 times with the most recent amendment in 2013.

**2.** **Chemical Weapons Convention Implementation Ordinance 2000The Ordinance extending to**
the whole of the country disallows the development, production, acquisition, stockpiling or
retaining a chemical weapon. Also no person can transfer, directly or indirectly, a chemical

**1.** **The Anti-­­Terrorism Act 1997 – Provides broad definition of terrorism. Established timelines**
for investigation and trial with specific tenure of judges. Amendments were introduced to
make the law more pragmatic abiding the courts by the same procedural rules of regular

system. The ATA 1997 has been amended 22 times with the most recent amendment in 2013.
