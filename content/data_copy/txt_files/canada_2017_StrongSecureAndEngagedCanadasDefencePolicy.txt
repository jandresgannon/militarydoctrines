#### MESSAGE FROM THE  MINISTER OF NATIONAL  DEFENCE

It is my privilege to present this new defence policy on behalf of the Government
of Canada� Strong, Secure, Engaged is a long-term, fully funded plan built around
people� The women and men of the Canadian Armed Forces and the families that
support them are at the heart of everything we do� Providing them the training,
equipment and care they deserve is the most important objective of this policy�

_Strong, Secure, Engaged was informed by the most open and transparent_
review Defence has ever undertaken� I would like to thank everyone who
contributed: thousands of Canadians who engaged online and in townhall
meetings organized by Members of Parliament, experts who participated in roundtables across the country, members
of the House of Commons and Senate committees who produced detailed reports, senior officials representing our key
allies, the many dedicated members of the Defence team who worked tirelessly, and our partner departments and agencies
in the federal government� I would also like to thank the four members of the Minister’s Advisory Panel, whose analysis
and advice was instrumental�

The pages that follow detail a new vision for the Defence team for the coming decades� It is about our contribution
to a Canada that is strong at home, secure in North America, and engaged in the world� In a rapidly changing and less
predictable world, we recognize that the distinction between domestic and international threats is becoming less relevant�
Therefore, we cannot be strong at home unless we are also engaged in the world�

The policy also includes a new framework for how we will implement that vision� “Anticipate, Adapt and Act,” sets
out a way of operating that addresses the challenges we face today, and the ones that will emerge tomorrow�

Canadians take pride in their Armed Forces, and its members serve their country admirably every day� Whether it is
responding to natural disasters, providing expert search and rescue, defending our sovereignty, or contributing to greater
peace and security in the world, our military answers the call wherever and whenever it occurs�

_Strong, Secure, Engaged is all about serving our women and men in uniform better than in the past� Looking to the_
future, Canadians can be confident that the policies and investments set out here will deliver what they need to get the
job done�

Yours sincerely,

The Honourable Harjit S� Sajjan, PC, OMM, MSM, CD, MP

#### MESSAGE FROM THE  MINISTER OF FOREIGN  AFFAIRS

Canadians’ security and prosperity go hand-in-hand� Today, we are connected
to – and affected by – everything that happens internationally, and we want to
be part of solutions to complex global challenges� Canadians rightly expect our
government and country to play a positive and constructive role�

As the Prime Minister has outlined, our objective is to restore constructive
Canadian leadership in the world and to promote Canada’s interests and values;
serve our security and economic interests; and contribute to a more peaceful
and prosperous world�

In order to do so, we must build a closer link between our foreign, defence, humanitarian, development, and trade
policies� Combined with our upcoming International Assistance Policy and progressive, feminist foreign policy, this
defence policy will help accomplish our shared objectives�

Canadians have always been ready to share the burden and responsibility of making the world a safer place� We have a
long history of working collaboratively with partners to prevent and respond to conflicts and crises abroad, including our
support for peace and stabilization operations� The same applies to policy and advocacy that strengthen global norms on
peace and security� Our commitment to collective security is reflected in our long-standing support for our core alliances,
NATO and NORAD, and for the United Nations�

A highly capable, flexible military with the ability to operate closely with allies and partners is an invaluable instrument of Canada’s foreign policy� This is why the Government’s new defence policy will form an essential part of Canada’s
future international engagement� It will reinforce our relations with key partners and allies� And it will support our joint
efforts to address global security threats, combat terrorism, and defend our continent�

This new policy has benefitted from extensive consultation with Canadians and our international partners� It provides
a map and means to advance the Government’s ambitious agenda� Our focus is to ensure that our foreign, defence,
development, and trade policies reinforce one another and deliver results for the people we serve: Canadians�

The Honourable Chrystia Freeland, PC, MP

#### MESSAGE FROM THE
 MINISTER’S ADVISORY PANEL 

It was a privilege to serve on the Minister’s Advisory Panel for the Defence Policy Review. We were invited by the Minister
of National Defence to provide him with our independent expert advice throughout the process of developing a new
defence policy for Canada, and we valued the opportunity to contribute in this important way.

It was clear from the beginning of our work that the task of crafting a new defence policy would be challenging for

the Department of National Defence and the Canadian Armed Forces, particularly in light of the profound changes in
the international and domestic security environments since the last Canadian defence policy was articulated in 2008. In
this regard, we agree with the underlying assessment in the new policy that, going forward, the Canadian Armed Forces
will be operating in a global security environment defined by complexity, unpredictability and instability.

Throughout the policy review process, we enjoyed unfettered access to the Minister of National Defence and the

senior leadership of the Department of National Defence and the Canadian Armed Forces, and we were given full
opportunity to express our views. We received detailed briefings on all major strategic issues facing the institution,
and we met with the senior leaders of the federal departments and agencies that work in partnership with our military
at home and abroad. We also participated in expert roundtables across Canada, and consulted with key allies and partner
organizations including NORAD, NATO, and the United Nations. The inputs we received throughout were compre­
hensive, insightful and strategically focused.

We were equally impressed by the quality and thoughtfulness of the hundreds of papers submitted by experts and

interested Canadians, and by the initiative of defence- and security-focused institutes and associations to organize specific
events concentrated on Canada’s new defence policy. We found many recurring policy-relevant themes, enormous
support for the women and men of the Canadian Armed Forces, and strong support among Canadians for a modernized
military force capable of meeting domestic, continental and international defence and security challenges well into the
future. This policy is aligned with that perspective.

We commend the depth and quality of the analysis that underpins Strong, Secure, Engaged, the frank discussion of

areas requiring attention, and the effort to share as much information as possible with Canadians about current and
future contributions and capabilities of the Canadian Armed Forces – at home, in North America and internationally.
By way of example, we note that the policy gives significant attention to critical emerging areas such as the cyber and
space domains, the shifts affecting Arctic security, the influence of non-state actors, and the changing nature of peace
operations. In addition, it fully reflects Canadian values when it comes to the challenges to the international humani­
tarian law governing armed conflict and the uncharted legal territory surrounding the use of autonomous vehicles and
cyber threats. At the same time, it recognizes the dynamic changes in the social environment and the urgent need to
address issues affecting the recruitment, training, retention, health and wellness of Regular and Reserve Force personnel,
as well as support to military families. It also acknowledges the importance of post-military life care and services for all
Canadian Armed Forces Veterans.

# EXECUTIVE SUMMARY


_Strong, Secure, Engaged presents a new vision and approach_
to defence by the Government of Canada.

This policy is deliberately ambitious and focuses, first

and foremost, on the heart of the Canadian Armed Forces –
the brave women and men who wear the uniform. Canada
cannot meet its defence needs at home and abroad without
the dedicated, motivated and highly skilled people who
work tirelessly to defend Canada and promote Canadian
values and interests abroad.

This new defence policy provides unprecedented

support to our people and their families. We ask a great
deal of our people, from deploying on peace operations to
responding to humanitarian crises.

The first step in ensuring that our women and men

in uniform are prepared and equipped to succeed on
operations, and that they are fully supported from recruit­
ment through retirement and beyond, is to give them the
resources they need to do their job.

This is the most rigorously costed Canadian defence

policy ever developed. It is transparent and fully funded.
To meet Canada’s defence needs at home and abroad,
the Government will grow defence spending over the next
10 years from $18.9 billion in 2016-17 to $32.7 billion
in 2026-27.

The long-term funding commitment that underpins

this policy will provide the Canadian Armed Forces with
the force size and equipment required to achieve excellence
across the full spectrum of military operations, from
humanitarian assistance and disaster relief, to peacekeeping,
to combat.

This policy includes long-term investments to enhance

the Canadian Armed Forces’ capabilities and capacity.

Because of the sacrifices that our military personnel

make every day, Canada remains among the safest and
most secure countries in the world. However, the interna­
tional landscape is shifting under tremendous pressures,
and the current security environment presents a variety of
threats, many that transcend national borders.


In the context of this complex, unpredictable security

environment, this policy provides a bold new vision and
approach to defend Canada and contribute to a more
peaceful world.

_Strong, Secure, Engaged offers clear direction on Cana­_

dian defence priorities over a 20-year horizon. It increases
the size of the Canadian Armed Forces, affirms Canada’s
unwavering commitment to its long-standing alliances
and partnerships, and provides vital new investments to
ensure our women and men in uniform have the modern
tools they need to succeed in – and return home safely
from – operations. This policy transforms how we care for
Canada’s military members and their families, from the
time of recruitment to retirement and beyond. We believe
this is critical to Canada’s security.


-----

###### WELL-SUPPORTED, DIVERSE, RESILIENT PEOPLE AND FAMILIES

We have placed an unprecedented focus on ensuring
our people and their families are well-supported, diverse
and resilient – physically, psychologically and socially.
This starts from the moment military members join the
Canadian Armed Forces, continues throughout their
careers, and extends to that crucial time of transition
when members step out of the uniform. Offering stead­
fast support to our people not only builds a strong and
agile defence organization, but also acknowledges the
sacred obligation the Government of Canada has to our
military personnel, Veterans, and their families. Military
families make an incredible contribution to the opera­
tional effectiveness of the Forces – they are the strength
behind the uniform.

###### Tax Relief for Deployed

 International Operations

Canadians know that when our women and men in

uniform deploy, they, and their families, make great sacri­
fices on behalf of their country. With this in mind, in
order to ensure that Canadian Armed Forces members are
treated equally on deployment, all troops deployed on any
named international operations[1] will be exempted from
paying federal income tax on their salary to the level of
Lieutenant-Colonel.[2] This is in addition to the allowances
awarded to compensate for hardship and risk.

1 The Chief of the Defence Staff is the authority to designate named operations.
2 This measure, which also applies to police, will be retroactive to January 1, 2017.


###### Diversity and Inclusion

To support the women and men of the Canadian

Armed Forces, we will substantially improve recruitment,
retention, and training of personnel. We will better
forecast occupational requirements and engage in more
targeted recruiting, including capitalizing on the unique
talents and skill-sets of Canada’s diverse population. The
Canadian Armed Forces will increase the proportion of
women in the military by 1 percent annually, to move
from the current 15 percent to 25 percent representation
by 2026.

###### $144.8 million to Support Military

 Family Resource Centres

We will ensure that military members and their families

are well supported, from the moment they join, through­
out their careers, and as they transition out of the military.
We are committed to providing more flexible, tailored
benefits and support that are personalized to the unique
circumstances and needs of each member throughout
this journey. This includes the implementation of specific
initiatives to help minimize the disruptions associated
with frequent relocation.

###### $198.2 million for new Total Health

 and Wellness Strategy

We will favour a more comprehensive approach to

care – known as “Total Health and Wellness” – and will
consider psychosocial well-being in the workplace, the
physical environment, and the personal health of members
(including physical, mental, spiritual, and familial).

###### Reinvention of Canadian Armed Forces
 Transition

We will transform the way the Canadian Armed Forces

supports the transition of personnel, whether returning to
active duty or transitioning seamlessly to post-military life
and the services of Veterans Affairs Canada. And, we will
create a new Canadian Armed Forces Transition Group that
represents a fundamental reinvention of the way transition
is managed. This Group – composed of 1,200 personnel,
including specialized staff and holding positions for ill and
injured – will work in collaboration with Veterans Affairs
Canada to provide our people with the individualized care
they need and deserve.


-----

###### DEFENCE FUNDING AND CAPABILITY
 INVESTMENT

To meet Canada’s defence needs at home and abroad, the
Government will grow annual defence spending over the
next 10 years from $17.1 billion in 2016-17 to $24.6 billion
in 2026-27 on an accrual basis. This translates to a rise in
annual defence spending on a cash basis from $18.9 billion
in 2016-17 to $32.7 billion in 2026-27.

###### Increase defence budget to $32.7 billion

 by 2026-27

This level of funding is affordable, achievable, and

has been informed by a rigorous, evidence-based analysis
of Canada’s defence needs and the resources required to
effectively deliver upon them over a 20-year horizon.

To deliver on the Government’s commitment to trans­

parency, results, and accountability, we will publish the
next Defence Investment Plan publicly.

###### Long-term Capability Investment

These investments will allow long-term investment

in Canadian Armed Forces capabilities. Funding will be
provided to the Royal Canadian Navy (RCN) to acquire
the full complement of 15 Canadian Surface Combatant
ships required to replace its existing frigates and retired
destroyers – one of the largest acquisitions in Canadian
shipbuilding history. The Canadian Army (CA) will
undergo a recapitalization of much of its land combat
capabilities and its aging vehicle fleets, while modernizing
its command and control systems. Additionally, it will
expand its light forces capability which will allow it to be
more agile and effective in complex operational theatres,
such as peace operations. The Royal Canadian Air Force
(RCAF) will acquire 88 advanced fighter aircraft to enforce


Canada’s sovereignty and to meet Canada’s North Ameri­
can Aerospace Defense Command (NORAD) and North
Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) commitments
while recapitalizing many of its aircraft fleets such as the
CP-140 Aurora anti-submarine warfare and surveillance
aircraft. Finally, the Canadian Special Operations Forces
Command (CANSOFCOM) will expand its operational
capacity and invest in capabilities that enable rapidly
deployable and agile Special Operations Forces (SOF) to
provide their unique skills both at home and abroad.

###### 71,500 Total Regular Force Size

The Regular Force will grow by 3,500 (to 71,500)

military personnel. This growth will enable critical invest­
ments in important areas such as space and cyber, intel­
ligence and targeting, and, most importantly, support to
the health and welfare of military personnel. These invest­
ments will provide the necessary flexibility to enable the
Canadian Armed Forces to operate across the spectrum
of operations, and leverage new technologies to maintain
Canadian Armed Forces interoperability with allies and
an operational advantage over potential adversaries.


-----

###### NEW VISION FOR DEFENCE:

 STRONG at home, SECURE in North America, ENGAGED in the world.

Informed by the challenges and opportunities we see in the
world around us, this policy defines how the Government
of Canada will support and employ the Canadian Armed
Forces to defend Canadian interests and contribute to a
more secure and peaceful world.

This policy is grounded in a thorough assessment of

the global security environment – one that is marked
by the shifting balance of power, the changing nature of
conflict, and the rapid evolution of technology. Increas­
ingly, threats, such as global terrorism and those in the
cyber domain, transcend national borders. These trends
undermine the traditional security once provided by
Canada’s geography. Defending Canada and Canadian
interests thus not only demands robust domestic defence
but also requires active engagement abroad.

In recognition of this dynamic, Canada’s defence

policy presents a new strategic vision for defence: Strong,
_Secure, Engaged. This is a vision in which Canada is:_

 - **Strong at home, its sovereignty well-defended by a**

Canadian Armed Forces also ready to assist in times
of natural disaster, other emergencies, and search and
rescue;

 - **Secure in North America, active in a renewed defence**

partnership in NORAD and with the United States;

 - **Engaged in the world, with the Canadian Armed**

Forces doing its part in Canada’s contributions to a
more stable, peaceful world, including through peace
support operations and peacekeeping.


In order to meet these objectives, Canada needs an

agile, multi-purpose, combat-ready military, operated by
highly trained, well-equipped women and men, secure
in the knowledge that they have the full support of their
government and their fellow Canadians.


###### TO SUCCEED IN AN UNPREDICTABLE
 AND COMPLEX SECURITY ENVIRONMENT, DEFENCE WILL:

 - Actively address threats abroad for stability at

home;

 - Field an agile, well-educated, flexible, diverse,

combat-ready military;

 - Develop sophisticated awareness of its operating

environment to better predict and respond to
crises;

 - Act as a responsible, value-added partner with

NORAD, NATO and Five-Eyes partners;

 - Work with the United States to ensure that

NORAD is modernized to meet existing and future
challenges;

 - Balance traditional relationships with the need

to engage emerging powers;

 - Field advanced capabilities to keep pace with

allies and maintain an advantage over potential
adversaries;

 - Address the threat stemming from terrorism and

the actions of violent extremist organizations,
including in ungoverned spaces;

 - Bolster its ability to respond to increasingly

severe natural disasters at home and abroad; and

 - Increase presence in the Arctic over the long
term and work cooperatively with Arctic partners.


-----

###### A NEW APPROACH TO DEFENCE:
 ANTICIPATE. ADAPT. ACT. 

To implement our new vision, Canada will also adopt a
new approach to defence – one that values the ability to
anticipate new challenges, adapt to changing circumstances,
and act with exemplary capability and professionalism
while supporting peace and security around the world.

**ANTICIPATING emerging threats and challenges**

is fundamental to Canada’s security. The Defence team
will improve its ability to provide timely information to
decision-makers, allowing the Government to identify
and understand emerging events and crises, respond
appropriately, and minimize the destructive effects of
prolonged conflict.

###### Global satellite communications,

 including in the Arctic

The Canadian Armed Forces will acquire next genera­

tion surveillance aircraft, remotely piloted systems –
commonly referred to as “drones” – and space-based
surveillance assets to significantly expand its Joint Intel­
ligence, Surveillance, and Reconnaissance capacity. These
new platforms will be integrated with existing assets into
a networked, joint system-of-systems that will enable the
real-time flow of information that is so essential to opera­
tional success.

###### Increased defence intelligence expertise

 and capacity

This targeted investment in equipment will be accom­

panied by a significant new investment in the defence
intelligence experts who collect, analyze, and disseminate
information.

###### $102.5 million investment in outreach

 to external experts

To complement our efforts to better understand the

dynamic root causes of conflict – including social and
economic factors – and complex geopolitical developments,
the Defence team will also launch a revitalized partnership
with external experts to capitalize on the extensive expertise
of Canadians. This will include new support and funding
for scholarship programs for Masters and Post-Doctoral
students interested in defence and security, and engage­
ments and events that promote dialogue in the defence
community.


**ADAPTING to the rapid pace of change in today’s**

fluid security environment is fundamental to operational
success. Canada’s new approach to defence adopts new
technologies and methods, and transforms the way people
are managed and employed.

###### Expanded capabilities in space and cyber

Canada will modernize its space capabilities and will

take steps to protect these critical assets against sophis­
ticated threats, while continuing to promote the peace­
ful use of outer space. We will assume a more assertive
posture in the cyber domain by hardening our defences,
and by conducting active cyber operations against poten­
tial adversaries in the context of government-authorized
military missions. Cyber operations will be subject to all
applicable domestic law, international law, and proven
checks and balances such as rules of engagement, targeting
and collateral damage assessments.

###### Fleet of remotely piloted systems

Given the unique value provided by remotely piloted

systems, the Canadian Armed Forces will also invest in
an extensive range of new capabilities for the RCN, the
CA, and the RCAF. This will include remotely piloted
aerial systems. More fundamentally, the core capabilities


-----

of the RCN, CA and RCAF will be placed on a fully
modern, robust footing, with a procurement renewal plan
buttressed by stable, consistent and transparent funding.
This will keep Canada secure and our sailors, soldiers and
airwomen and men properly cared for and supported –
both during their time in service, and as they transition to
post-military life.

###### $313 million over five years for the

 Innovation for Defence Excellence

 and Security (IDEaS) Program

To promote a longer term culture of innovation, we

will launch a new Innovation for Defence Excellence and
Security (IDEaS) program to create clusters of defence
innovators conducting leading-edge research and develop­
ment in areas critical to future defence needs. The Defence
team will foster a competitive environment and challenge
innovators to develop solutions to emerging problems,
allowing innovators to approach challenges from their
own unique perspectives and remove artificial constraints
that stifle creativity. New ideas will be supported through
investment in research and flexible procurement arrange­
ments. This will allow the Government to work in part­
nership with industry to develop and test new products to
meet evolving capability needs while also positioning firms
to pursue new export opportunities in the global market.

###### 30,000-strong Reserve Force:

 Full-Time Capability, Part-Time Service

This policy enables the Reserve Force to achieve a full
time capability through part-time service. The size of the
Reserve Force will be increased by 1,500 to 30,000. The
Reserve Force will receive new operational roles and will
become further integrated into the total force. The Cana­
dian Armed Forces will also create a more agile model that
supports the transition between full- and part-time service
that meets the needs of the member and the institution.

###### $225 million to reduce carbon footprint

The Government will make fundamental changes to

the business of defence to improve management practices
and reduce its greenhouse gas emissions. Canada will
invest $225 million by 2020 in a range of infrastructure
projects to reduce its carbon footprint, including demol­
ishing outdated buildings with limited operational value.
All new construction and major recapitalization projects
will be the Silver Leadership in Energy and Environmental
Design (LEED) standard or equivalent. The Department


of National Defence will also transition part of the nonmilitary fleets to hybrid and electric by 2020.

###### Over 80 percent of defence procurement
 contracts to be managed by Defence

The Defence team will introduce reforms to stream­

line the procurement process. These reforms will reduce
departmental approval times by 50 percent, increase
contracting authority to allow 80 percent of procurement
contracts to be managed internally, align innovation in
the Canadian defence industry to defence procurement
needs, increase transparency with industry and the Cana­
dian public, and strengthen the procurement workforce.

To ACT decisively with effective military capability is

the ultimate goal of Canada’s new approach to defence.
The Government of Canada is making a long-term
investment in the Canadian Armed Forces – the largest
commitment of capital funding and modernization in
decades. The Canadian Armed Forces will be prepared
to renew Canada’s strong commitment to NORAD and
NATO, acting in multiple theatres simultaneously, while
also bolstering disaster relief, search and rescue, contribu­
tions to peace operations and capacity building.

_Strong, Secure, Engaged delivers on the Government of_

Canada’s enduring commitment to defend Canada, work
with the United States in the shared defence of North
America, and be a credible and engaged international
actor. This new vision and approach will improve the
employment, support, and care of the Canadian Armed
Forces and deliver results for all Canadians.


-----

###### CANADIAN ARMED FORCES CORE MISSIONS

At any given time, the Government of Canada can call
upon the Canadian Armed Forces to undertake missions
for the protection of Canada and Canadians and the
maintenance of international peace and stability. This
policy ensures the Canadian Armed Forces will be pre­
pared to:

 - Detect, deter and defend against threats to or

attacks on Canada;

 - Detect, deter and defend against threats to or

attacks on North America in partnership with the
United States, including through NORAD;

 - Lead and/or contribute forces to NATO and coalition

efforts to deter and defeat adversaries, including
terrorists, to support global stability;

 - Lead and/or contribute to international peace opera­

tions and stabilization missions with the United
Nations, NATO and other multilateral partners;

 - Engage in capacity building to support the security

of other nations and their ability to contribute to
security abroad;

 - Provide assistance to civil authorities and law en­

forcement, including counter-terrorism, in support
of national security and the security of Canadians
abroad;

 - Provide assistance to civil authorities and non
governmental partners in responding to interna­
tional and domestic disasters or major emergen­
cies; and

 - Conduct search and rescue operations.


###### CONCURRENT OPERATIONS

This policy ensures the Canadian Armed Forces will be
prepared to simultaneously:

 - Defend Canada, including responding concurrently

to multiple domestic emergencies in support of
civilian authorities;

 - Meet its NORAD obligations, with new capacity in

some areas;

 - Meet commitments to NATO Allies under Article 5

of the North Atlantic Treaty;

 - Contribute to international peace and stability

through:

− Two sustained deployments of

~500-1500 personnel, including one as a
lead nation;

− One time-limited deployment of

~500-1500 personnel (6-9 months duration);

− Two sustained deployments of

~100-500 personnel;

− Two time-limited deployments (6-9 months)

of ~100-500 personnel;

− One Disaster Assistance Response Team

(DART) deployment, with scaleable additional
support; and

− One Non-Combatant Evacuation Operation,

with scaleable additional support.


The process that culminated in this document began

with the most comprehensive public consultations ever
undertaken by the Department of National Defence
and the Canadian Armed Forces. The Canadian public,
defence experts, Parliamentarians, and our allies and part­
ners around the world made substantive contributions.
Canadians submitted more than 20,000 entries into an
online consultation portal, and defence experts and stake­
holders participated in nine roundtable events, includ­
ing discussions dedicated to industry and innovation,
gender perspectives, and indigenous affairs. Parliamentary
committees in both the House of Commons and Senate
conducted insightful studies and Parliamentarians from
all parties held town hall meetings with Canadians across
the country. Canadian defence officials also engaged
counterparts around the world to exchange best practices.
Thank you for your contributions.

This defence policy is informed by what we heard.

# 1 WELL-SUPPORTED,
 DIVERSE, RESILIENT PEOPLE   AND FAMILIES


People are at the core of everything the Canadian Armed
Forces does to deliver on its mandate. As we look to the
future, we will also refocus our efforts on ensuring the
entire Defence team has the care, services and support it
requires. Doing so will be central to attracting and retaining
the people we need to keep Canada strong, secure, and
engaged in the world. Investing in our people is the single
most important commitment we can make.

The Defence team is composed of Canadian Armed

Forces members and defence civilians of the Department
of National Defence. This integrated, civilian-military
team works to deliver Defence objectives. The Canadian
Armed Forces executes operations at home and abroad
to defend Canada and Canadian interests, while defence
civilians perform a number of critical enabling functions
including intelligence, equipment procurement and
maintenance, policy, communications support, infrastruc­
ture services, finance, human resources, information
technology and scientific research and development. In
order to meet the high ambition set out in this policy,
the Canadian Armed Forces will increase its ranks by
3,500 Regular Force (to 71,500 total) and 1,500 Reserve
Force members (to 30,000 total) and the Department of
National Defence will hire an additional 1,150 defence
civilians to support military operations in areas such as
intelligence and procurement.

Some of the new initiatives to support our personnel

in this policy, such as mental health initiatives and
promoting a culture of healthy, respectful workplace
behaviour, apply to the entire team, while others such as
the foundational transformation of transition support are
unique to our military members.

Military service is extremely rewarding, and military

members and their families become stronger through the
unique challenges and opportunities they face in their
work. They become more resilient, discover and strengthen


their best attributes, and live meaningful, fulfilled lives,
secure in the knowledge that they are serving their country,
and that they are appreciated and will be taken care of
throughout their service.

Military service is also inherently challenging. On

operations, the potential for serious physical and mental
injuries is a reality. Prolonged absence from loved ones can
put strain on families and relationships. The Canadian
Armed Forces must deliver on its responsibility to care and
support our people when they encounter these challenges.

Delivering on our commitment to our people and

their families is a sacred obligation and requires a compre­
hensive suite of initiatives that cover all aspects of how we
recruit, lead, train and care for sailors, soldiers, airwomen
and men, as well as all those who support them. As Canada


###### PROFESSION OF ARMS

The profession of arms in Canada is composed of mili­
tary members dedicated to the defence of Canada and
its interests, as directed by the Government of Canada.

The profession of arms is distinguished by the concept
of service before self, and the acceptance of the con­
cept of unlimited liability.

Its members possess a systematic and specialized
body of military knowledge and skills acquired through
education, training and experience, and they apply this
expertise competently and objectively in the accom­
plishment of their missions.

Members of the Canadian profession of arms share
a set of core values and beliefs found in the military
ethos that guides them in the performance of their
duty and allows a special relationship of trust to be
maintained with Canadian society.


-----

and Canadians change, so too must our approach to
our people. To ensure they and their families thrive, we
will continue to incorporate progressive best practices
into our approach. Throughout, our actions must be
underpinned by a sense of compassion and responsibility
towards the women and men who wear the uniform, and
their loved ones.


###### DEFENCE CIVILIANS

Defence civilians face different demands than many
of their public service counterparts, and Defence is
committed to meeting their needs accordingly.

Working at the Department of National Defence involves
weighty decisions that can impact the lives of others,
placing stress on employees that is unique across
the public service. Defence civilians also form close
bonds with their military co-workers and can be
deeply affected by tragic losses associated with mili­
tary operations.

Increasingly, defence civilians also have a role in
supporting operations. Policy advisors and trades­
people deploy alongside the Canadian Armed Forces
in expeditionary operations, facing similar challenges
associated with prolonged absences from family and
the stresses of high-tempo military operations in
dangerous locations.


###### RECRUITMENT, TRAINING AND
 RETENTION

The operational success of the Canadian Armed Forces
begins with a robust recruiting system that engages and
attracts the best and brightest, communicates the unique
opportunities and benefits of military service, and effi­
ciently and effectively selects and enrolls new recruits.
**The current system is too slow to compete in Canada’s**
**highly competitive labour market and does not effectively**
**communicate the exciting and fulfilling employment**
**opportunities offered by military service. The Canadian**
Armed Forces offers more than 100 career options, many of
which are unique to the military, and provides unparalleled
professional and personal development opportunities.

The military’s personnel system must be more agile

and responsible. It must be able to maintain a skilled force
across a broad range of tasks while meeting requirements
in critical occupations facing shortages, particularly those
focused on caring for our personnel such as medical officers,
dentists, pharmacists, and social workers. The Canadian
Armed Forces must also attract Canadians with the apti­
tudes and skill-sets required to succeed in highly technical
domains such as space and cyberspace and to operate and
maintain increasingly sophisticated equipment, including
remotely piloted systems.

Most importantly, the Canadian Armed Forces must

reflect the diversity of the country we defend. We need
**a military that looks like Canada. In particular, we are**


-----

###### PROGRAMS FOR INDIGENOUS CANADIANS

The Canadian Armed Forces has a number of unique programs to provide Indigenous Peoples with an opportunity
to learn about an exciting career with the military. Whether participants decide to join or not, these programs offer
interesting opportunities to gain skills and knowledge about the Canadian Armed Forces.

_Aboriginal Leadership Opportunities Year: Provides a one-year educational and leadership experience through_
the Royal Military College (RMC) of Canada. During the program, participants are enrolled as Officer Cadets and
receive free tuition and books. Participants have the option to continue at RMC in a degree program with the Forces.

_Bold Eagle, Raven, Black Bear: These three summer training programs combine military lifestyle with cultural_
awareness to give a six-week taste of military training with the option – but no commitment – to join the Canadian
Armed Forces. Training is based on the Army Reserve Basic military qualification and covers topics such as weapons
handling, navigation, first-aid, drill and survival skills. All three programs begin with a Culture Camp taught by Elders
of different First Nations and Indigenous groups, to ease the transition from civilian to military lifestyle and to ground
the training in common spiritual beliefs.

_Canadian Armed Forces Aboriginal Entry Program: This special three-week program allows hands-on experience_
with military training, careers, and lifestyle with no obligation to join the Forces. Participants receive a stipend and
a certificate of military achievement for completing the program. Transport, accommodation, food, clothing and
equipment are provided for the duration of the course while participants learn about the long and proud history of
Indigenous Canadians in the military and take part in exercises similar to basic training.


committed to attracting, recruiting and retaining more
women in the Canadian Armed Forces across all ranks and
promoting women into senior leadership positions. The
Canadian Armed Forces is committed to gender equality
and providing a work environment where women are
welcomed, supported and respected.

Once recruited, the Canadian Armed Forces needs to

follow through with modern, world-class training that will
put new recruits on a solid foundation to succeed. This
will require adapting training to meet the highly technical
requirements of modern militaries, and the Canadian
Armed Forces will also need to demonstrate to potential
recruits that the military can offer competitive training
and technical certifications on par with the standards of
industry and the private sector. This includes maintaining
the long tradition of providing the complete range of
military education through proud institutions such as the
Royal Military College of Canada, renewed Collège militaire
royal in St-Jean, and the Canadian Forces College.

It is imperative that we protect our investment in the

expertise and knowledge of our people. This policy includes
a number of initiatives designed to help the Canadian
Armed Forces retain the talented people it recruits.

The Canadian Armed Forces will keep remuneration

and benefits of Regular and Reserve personnel under
constant review, to ensure that military personnel receive
fair compensation for their service to Canada. The Canadian
Armed Forces’ competitive compensation package goes


###### TAX RELIEF ON DEPLOYED OPERATIONS:

Currently, the tax relief benefit for military personnel
on deployed operations is applied inconsistently.
This benefit is meant to acknowledge the considerable
sacrifices Canadian Armed Forces members and their
families make in defence of Canada and its values,
when deployed internationally. A more consistent
application of this benefit will improve morale and
recognize the burdens taken on by military members
and their families in service of our country.


-----

beyond an adequate salary and includes a wide range
of benefits, recognition, care and support throughout
military members’ careers. Canadians know that when
our women and men in uniform deploy, they, and their
families, make great sacrifices on their behalf. From
the moment they put on the uniform, members of the
Canadian Armed Forces take on unlimited liability. In
particular, when the Government of Canada calls upon
members of the Canadian Armed Forces to deploy
anywhere in the world, it is their duty to go. With this
in mind, in order to ensure that Canadian Armed Forces
members are treated equally on deployment, **all troops**
**deployed on all named international operations[3] will**
**no longer pay federal income tax on their salary up to**
**the level of Lieutenant-Colonel.[4]** This change in policy
will not affect the assessment and awarding of existing
hardship and risk allowances earned by Canadian Armed
Forces personnel deployed abroad.

Furthermore, the Canadian Armed Forces will explore

how to best enhance the flexibility of military careers.
This includes making it easier to transition between fulland part-time military service in order to retain valuable
military skills and accommodate changing career paths.

The Canadian Armed Forces will also introduce new

measures that allow some military members who no
longer meet universality of service – that is, the require­


ment that all Canadian Armed Forces personnel be fit for
deployment – due to illness or injury incurred while serving
in the military to continue to serve on a case-by-case basis.
This will help retain valuable knowledge and skills in the
Canadian Armed Forces to meet specific requirements.

In short, to be highly competitive in the labour market

the Canadian Armed Forces will become more personalized
in its administrative and leadership approach, and provide
the career options, satisfaction, and support necessary for
our people and their families to succeed.


###### NEW INITIATIVES

To ensure the effective recruitment, training and
retention of the future work force, the Defence
team will:

1. Reduce significantly the time to enroll in the
Canadian Armed Forces by reforming all aspects of
military recruiting.

2. Implement a recruitment campaign to promote the
unique full- and part-time career opportunities of­
fered by the Canadian Armed Forces, as well as
to support key recruitment priorities, including hir­
ing more women, increasing diversity, addressing
priority occupations, and the requirements of the
Reserve Force.

3. Restore the Collège militaire royal in St-Jean as a
full degree-granting institution to help prepare the
next generation of Canadian Armed Forces leaders.

4. Increase the capacity of the Canadian Armed Forces
Leadership and Recruit School to accommodate
the increased number of recruits associated with
a larger force size.


5. Develop and implement a comprehensive Canadian
Armed Forces Retention Strategy to keep our talented
people in uniform with a welcoming and healthy
work environment.

6. Undertake a comprehensive review of conditions
of service and career paths to allow much more
personalized career choices and flexibility.

7. Modernize the Canadian Armed Forces Honours
and Awards system to ensure military members’
service to Canada is recognized in a more timely
and appropriate manner.

8. Implement the first-ever, integrated strategy for
human resources to balance the optimal assignment
of tasks between the military, defence civilians and
the private sector.

9. Provide tax-free salary for all Canadian Armed
Forces members deployed on all named interna­
tional operations, up to the maximum rate of pay
applied to a Lieutenant-Colonel. This would not
impact hardship and risk pay or operational allow­
ances regulated by the Military Foreign Service
Instructions (MFSI), which will continue. This ini­
tiative is retroactive to January 2017.


3 The Chief of the Defence Staff is the authority to designate named operations.
4 This measure which also applies to police will be retroactive to January 1 2017 The change requires an amendment be made to the Income Tax Act

###### LEVERAGING CANADA’S DIVERSITY

The Canadian Armed Forces is committed to demonstrat­
ing leadership in reflecting Canadian ideals of diversity,
respect and inclusion, including striving for gender equal­
ity and building a workforce that leverages the diversity
of Canadian society. Canada’s unique, diverse and multi­
cultural population is one of its greatest strengths. While
positive steps have been made towards greater diversity,
inclusion and gender equality, we can do much more to
reflect and harness the strength and diversity of the people
we serve, in both military and civilian ranks.

We are fully committed to implementing our new

comprehensive Diversity Strategy and Action Plan, which
will promote an institution-wide culture that embraces
diversity and inclusion. This includes reinforcing diversity
in the identity of the Canadian Armed Forces and our
doctrine, modernizing career management and all poli­
cies to support diversity and inclusion, and conducting
targeted research to better understand diversity within the
Department of National Defence.

Embracing diversity will enhance military opera­

tional effectiveness by drawing on all of the strengths of
Canada’s population. Building a Defence team composed
of people with new perspectives and a broader range of
cultural, linguistic, gender, age, and other unique attri­
butes will contribute directly to efforts to develop a deeper
understanding of our increasingly complex world, and to
respond effectively to the challenges it presents.

Diversity and inclusion initiatives also support many

of our objectives for personnel, including providing a
positive work place and supporting total health and wellbeing.


###### NEW INITIATIVES

To fully leverage Canada’s diversity, the Defence
team will:

10. Promote diversity and inclusion as a core insti­

tutional value across the Defence team.

11. Appoint a Diversity Champion who will oversee

the implementation of all aspects of the Diversity
Strategy and Action plan including instituting
mandatory diversity training across all phases
of professional development.

12. Integrate Gender-Based Analysis Plus (GBA+)

in all defence activities across the Canadian
Armed Forces and the Department of National
Defence, from the design and implementation of
programs and services that support our person­
nel, to equipment procurement and operational
planning.

13. Place a new focus on recruiting and retaining

under-represented populations within the Cana­
dian Armed Forces, including, but not limited to,
women, Indigenous peoples, and members of
visible minorities.

14. Aspire to be a leader in gender balance in the

military by increasing the representation of women
by 1 percent annually over the next 10 years to
reach 25 percent of the overall force.


###### WOMEN IN THE CANADIAN ARMED FORCES:

Currently, 15 percent of Canadian Armed Forces mem­
bers are women. The NATO average for women in the
military is 11 percent. The Canadian Armed Forces is
committed to further increasing the representation of
women in the military by 1percent annually towards a
goal of 25 percent in 10 years. This will not only contribute
to positive Canadian Armed Forces culture change, but
will also increase overall operational effectiveness.


-----

GBA+ is an analytical tool used to assess the potential
impacts of policies, programs, services, and other initia­
tives on diverse groups of people, taking into account
gender and a range of other identity factors. GBA+ is a
critical tool in the decision-making process, and recog­
nized as a key competency in support of the develop­
ment of effective programs and policies for Canadians.
It provides federal officials with the means to continu­
ally improve their work and attain better results for
Canadians by being more responsive to specific needs
and circumstances.

The Defence team is fully committed to using GBA+ in
the development and execution of defence operations,
policies and programs, and used GBA+ as an integral
component of the analysis for the development of this
new defence policy.

First and foremost, the Defence team will apply GBA+
analysis to the full range of programs and services that
recruit, support and care for Canadian Armed Forces per­
sonnel. This will be critical to ensure that the Defence
team can meet the needs of its diverse and multicultural
workforce across Canada.

Training and education are at the core of Defence
team’s commitment to GBA+ as a means to advance
gender equality in Canada. New programs and training
are being instituted at all levels of Defence to ensure
these important tools and knowledge are incorporated
on a daily basis.


The Defence team will require members to undertake
GBA+ training and all military personnel policies will be
examined through a GBA+ lens and updated as needed.

The Defence team also recognizes that conflict, natural
disasters, and humanitarian crises affect people differently.
Accordingly, the Defence team is integrating GBA+ into the
planning and execution of operations as a means to both
improve operational effectiveness and meet the needs
of those who are disproportionately affected by conflict
and crisis. This includes the establishment of military
gender advisor positions who will advise on gender in
operational planning and doctrine, and modeling the
value of diversity, inclusion and gender equality when
working with other nations. Working to implement and
advance the Women, Peace and Security agenda laid
out in the United Nations Security Council’s landmark
Resolution 1325 and subsequent related resolutions,
will be an important aspect of Canada’s international
military engagement, including our renewed commit­
ment to United Nations peacekeeping.


-----

###### TOTAL HEALTH AND CARE
 FOR OUR PEOPLE

The Defence team must ensure that the needs of its people
– whether military members and their families, or defence
civilians – are appropriately met. They are the heart and
soul of everything we do.

For the Canadian Armed Forces, this means military

members and their families are well-supported from the
moment they join, throughout their careers, and as they
transition out of the military. This includes keeping the
door open to Veterans who want to return to service, or
who later need support and assistance. Not only is this
important to build a strong and agile defence organization,
but the Canadian Armed Forces also has a fundamental
moral obligation to care for those who have accepted
unlimited liability in the service of their fellow citizens.

We are committed to providing more flexible, tailored

service and support, personalized to the unique circum­
stances and needs of each member. The needs of members
and their families will evolve throughout their careers and
so too must the services and support on which they rely.
To achieve success, the Government of Canada must be
less risk averse in providing care and much more transparent
and open in its communication. We will shed one-size fits
all solutions in favour of more people-centred, compas­
sionate, dependable and comprehensive services.

This new approach will also favour a more all-inclusive,

comprehensive approach to care – known as Total Health
and Wellness. This approach considers psychological wellbeing in the workplace, the physical work environment,
and personal health, including physical, mental, spiritual


and familial aspects of members’ lives. The well-being of
our Canadian Armed Forces’ current and former members
and their families relies on health in all of these areas.

To provide appropriate support, care and services

to ensure the total health and well-being of Canadian
Armed Forces personnel, we will invest $198.2 million
over the course of this policy to implement the Total
Health and Wellness Strategy. This strategy will expand
wellness beyond the traditional health care model to
include promotion, prevention, treatment and support,
and provide a greater range of health and wellness
services and programs. Of note, the strategy includes
key initiatives to:

 - support health and resilience;

 - promote a culture of healthy behaviour; and

 - support military families.

The Canadian Armed Forces will also continue to

provide a full spectrum of safe, high-quality physical
health services through a well-governed health care system
that meets or exceeds Canadian standards, both in garrison
and during operations.

The mental health and workplace well-being of defence

civilians is also critical to the success of the Canadian
Armed Forces, given the important roles they play as part
of an integrated civilian-military Defence team. Civilians
face challenges associated with being defence professionals
not present in the rest of the public service and we are
committed to providing them with a healthy, supportive
workplace and the mental health and other support they
require.


-----

###### SUPPORTING HEALTH AND RESILIENCE

Serving in the Canadian Armed Forces is extremely
rewarding but military service places unique demands
and stresses on individual members - stresses that can
have a profound impact on all aspects of health, from
the psychological trauma that can be experienced on
deployment to the strain that frequent relocation puts on
individuals, families, personal relationships, finances and
social networks.

Compared to the Canadian population, military

personnel experience higher rates of depression and posttraumatic stress disorder. Suicide rates over recent years
have also shown a worrying upward trend. Suicide usually
includes an element of mental illness and other stressors
that can be aggravated by the rigours of military service,
particularly if appropriate supports and services are not
sought or in place.

Mental health and suicide are complex issues that

have no easy solutions. However, we are committed to
continually improving our approach and providing the
best possible care and support. Mental health is a critical
aspect of overall health. This includes employing progres­
sive, evidence-based practices and technology and form­
ing cooperative relationships with world-class leaders in
mental health to continue to improve care and deepen our
knowledge and expertise in this important area. In particu­
lar, we must and will do a better job in providing adequate
care and treatment for personnel suffering from critical
stress response injuries, running the gamut from mild
battle stress to Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD).

Canadian Armed Forces members also face challenges

with Operational Stress Injuries (OSI). This term is used


to describe any persistent psychological difficulty result­
ing from operational duties performed in the Canadian
Armed Forces and can include a wide range of problems
such as anxiety disorders, depression and PTSD, as well as
other conditions that may be less severe but still interfere
with daily life. OSIs are complex psychiatric conditions,
many of which are not well understood. Recognizing
this, the Canadian Armed Forces provides a wide range
of programs and services focused on the prevention and
treatment of mental health issues, including seven special­
ized operational trauma and stress support centres across
Canada that provide evidence-based medical treatment
for OSIs.

The Canadian Armed Forces has come a long way in

changing internal attitudes to these injuries, removing the
stigma and career stress that once dissuaded some from
reporting them. But much more work needs to be done.
That includes caring for those currently serving, and those
who have served in the past and are now struggling to
cope with the demands of civilian life.

Effective support and services will help the Canadian

Armed Forces be more resilient in the face of challenges
and enhance operational readiness. We are committed to
modernizing the Canadian Armed Forces Health System,
removing barriers to care including eliminating the stigma
associated with getting help, and ensuring all necessary
tools are in place to identify and provide appropriate care
to those who need it.


###### NEW INITIATIVES

To improve the resilience and health of its members,
the Canadian Armed Forces will:

15. Augment the Canadian Armed Forces Health

System to ensure it meets the unique needs of
our personnel with efficient and effective care,
anywhere they serve in Canada or abroad. This
includes growing the Medical Services Branch
by 200 personnel.

16. Implement a joint National Defence and Veterans

Affairs Suicide Prevention Strategy that hires
additional mental health professionals and imple­
ments a joint framework focused on preventing
suicide across the entire military and Veteran
community.

17. Remove barriers to care, including creating an

environment free from stigma where military
members are encouraged to raise health con­
cerns of any nature and seek appropriate help
when they need it.


-----

###### PROMOTING A CULTURE OF
 LEADERSHIP, RESPECT AND HONOUR

The Canadian Armed Forces is fully committed to provid­
ing a workplace free from harassment and discrimination.
In addition to a range of gender, diversity and inclusion
initiatives and the Total Health and Wellness Strategy, we
will continue to fully implement the recommendations of
the Deschamps Report on sexual misconduct in the mili­
tary, in addition to continuing defence ethics and leader­
ship programs, and other initiatives related to inclusivity,
diversity and respect.

The progress achieved to date in meeting the recom­

mendations of the Deschamps Report is a clear demon­
stration of the Canadian Armed Forces’ commitment to
eliminating and preventing harmful and inappropriate
sexual behaviour and sexual offences within our ranks.


This began with the unequivocal acknowledgement
by senior military leadership that inappropriate sexual
behaviour is a serious and unacceptable problem that
exists in the Canadian Armed Forces. This policy affirms
our commitment to work towards solutions that result in
positive and enduring culture change.

Positive culture change requires a commitment to

promoting the respect of all members as equal contribu­
tors to the Canadian Armed Forces community. Until
this culture change is fully realized, the first priority will
remain on taking better care of victims and survivors with
responsive, individualized support. The Sexual Miscon­
duct Response Centre has been established as the firstever dedicated independent support centre for Canadian
Armed Forces members and provides victims with options
to reach out for information and support in a confidential
manner. Resources across the Canadian Armed Forces –
from health services, to chaplains, to the Ombudsman
and senior leadership, as well as military police and the
military justice system – have also been enhanced and
more improvements are forthcoming.

To ensure that results are achieved, monitoring and

measuring mechanisms have been put in place. The
Defence team is providing regular updates on its progress
in addressing this important issue. Adjustments will be
made as necessary to ensure that a positive culture change
is achieved.


###### ENHANCED INVESTIGATION AND
 PROSECUTION OF SEXUAL OFFENCES

The Canadian Armed Forces is committed to improving
the way it investigates and prosecutes sexual offences
and has implemented a number of initiatives towards
this end, including:

 - the creation of Military Police Sexual Offence

Response Teams. Members of these teams receive
specialized training in investigating crimes of a
sexual nature including the latest forensic and
interviewing techniques;

 - broader training to Military Police to help meet

the needs of victims and survivors while also
collecting the necessary evidence;

 - measures to ensure that sensitive information

collected during investigations is protected from
unnecessary disclosure so that victims and sur­
vivors have the confidence to come forward;

 - new direction from the Director of Military Pros­

ecutions to military prosecutors to help minimize
the trauma to victims and survivors during court
proceedings and to ensure they are treated with
the appropriate sensitivity; and

 - ongoing training for military prosecutors to

enhance the prosecution of sexual offences in
line with leading best practices.

The Canadian Armed Forces is committed to effec­
tively investigating and prosecuting these serious
crimes and will continue to explore further initiatives
to enhance its ability to support victims and survivors
and bring perpetrators to justice.

###### OPERATION HONOUR: INSTITUTIONALIZED CULTURE CHANGE

In March 2015, Justice Marie Deschamps released
the findings of her external review of Canadian Armed
Forces policies, procedures, and programs in relation
to sexual harassment and sexual assault, including the
effectiveness with which these policies are currently
being implemented. Her report included 10 recom­
mendations to drive a culture change in the Cana­
dian Armed Forces and address the situation. These
recommendations were accepted in full by the Chief
of the Defence Staff and their implementation has
been institutionalized across the Defence team under
Operation HONOUR.

Operation HONOUR is the Canadian Armed Forces
mission to eliminate harmful and inappropriate sexual
behaviour in the Canadian military that is based on
the principles that:

 - every woman and man who serves their country

deserves to be treated with dignity and respect
– anything less is simply unacceptable; and

 - any attitudes or behaviours that undermine the

camaraderie, cohesion and confidence of serving
members threatens the Canadian Armed Forces’
long-term operational success.

Operation HONOUR seeks to effect a positive institu­
tional culture change in the Canadian Armed Forces
through four lines of effort:

 - _understanding the issue of harmful and_

inappropriate sexual behaviour;

 - _responding more decisively to incidents;_

 - _supporting victims more effectively; and_

 - _preventing incidents from occurring._


###### SUPPORTING MILITARY FAMILIES

Military families are the strength behind the uniform.
Family members of Canadian Armed Forces personnel
share in the stresses and strains resulting from deployments
of their loved ones into dangerous operational duty, and
the prolonged separations they entail. They also make
important sacrifices and face challenges associated with
frequent relocation such as finding new family health
care providers, re-establishing childcare, moving children
between schools and education systems, professional
licensing, and dealing with inconveniences such as chang­
ing drivers’ and vehicles licences when moving between
provinces. They must also deal with the financial instability
resulting from frequent moves, whether it be the loss of
employment, different tax systems or changes to post-living
differentials.

Families are the major source of support and strength

to Canadian Armed Forces members and integral to our
military success. Military families make an incredible
contribution to the operational effectiveness of the Forces
and must have access to the support and services they
deserve, to cope with the unique challenges and stresses of
military family life. The implementation of a Comprehen­
sive Military Family Plan will go a long way to minimizing
the disruptions associated with frequent relocation.

The Canadian Armed Forces is committed to enhancing

the support we provide to the families of military members,
including through the front-line service provided by
Military Family Resource Centres.


###### NEW INITIATIVES

To eliminate harmful behaviours and ensure a
work environment free from harassment and
discrimination, the Defence team will:

18. Complete the full implementation of the 10

recommendations of the Deschamps Report
through Operation HONOUR.

19. Provide a full range of victim and survivor support

services to Canadian Armed Forces members.

20. Deal with harassment complaints in a clear and

timely manner by simplifying formal harassment
complaint procedures.

21. Be open and transparent with Canadians and

members of the Canadian Armed Forces in com­
municating progress on this important issue.


-----

###### NEW INITIATIVES

To improve support and services offered for mili­
tary family members, the Defence team will:

22. Implement teams at Wings and Bases across

Canada, in partnership with Military Family
Resource Centres, to prevent and respond to
gender-based violence.

23. Improve access to psychological services through

social workers and referrals to community pro­
grams and services.

24. Develop a Comprehensive Military Family Plan

to help stabilize family life for Canadian Armed
Forces members and their families who frequently
have to relocate. This includes:

   - Providing an additional $6 million per year to

modernize Military Family Support Programs,
such as Military Family Resource Centres,
to provide better support to families when
members are deploying or during periods of
absence;

   - Establishing relocation expertise to help

military families find and access the services
they need in a new community; and

   - Working with federal, provincial and private

sector partners to improve the coordination
of services across provinces to ease the
burden of moving.

###### REINVENTING TRANSITION

Life as a member of the Canadian Armed Forces is a
process of continuous transition, from the moment a
person steps into a recruitment centre to the day they
take off the uniform, and beyond. Through their careers,
military members will take on different jobs, get posted
to various bases across the country, participate in training
exercises, and deploy on operations at home and abroad.
Putting service before self – the ethos of the Canadian
Armed Forces – involves frequent life changes, which can
place significant stress on our members and their families.
These stresses are particularly acute for those who suffer
illness or injury that prevents them getting back to active
duty. That is why, when it comes to the transition out of
uniform, we need to work with Veterans Affairs Canada
to provide the best possible care and support to our
military personnel.

While recruits receive a lot of personalized attention as

they train and develop into sailors, soldiers, and airwomen
and men, the same approach does not exist for members
leaving the military. This defence policy is correcting
this not only because it is the right thing to do, but also
because caring for our own is critical to ensuring that we
can attract and retain Canada’s best and brightest.

This policy reinvents the way we approach transition. It

ensures that members receive the professional, customized,
and personalized support they need as they transition to
post-military life. This will ease their adjustment, and help
them continue to live productive, meaningful lives.

To deliver dedicated professional and personalized

support to all Canadian Armed Forces members, includ­
ing those in transition, the Canadian Armed Forces will
re-establish a Personnel Administration Branch of experts
in military human resources management. A new Cana­
dian Armed Forces Transition Group, commanded by a
General Officer, will be established. All military personnel
will use the services of this group, where the professional
staff will ensure that all pre-release and pension adminis­
tration is completed, and benefits are in place, before the
transition to post-military life. This group will also make
sure that retired members are aware of and/or enrolled in
career transition programs offered by the Defence team
and Veterans Affairs Canada as well as third-party service
providers, such as vocational rehabilitation, individual
career counselling, job search placement, and financial
literacy.


-----

**_All retiring members require transition support, but_**

**_the needs are most acute for our ill and injured. The Cana­_**
**_dian Armed Forces Transition Group will look after ill_**
**_and injured personnel with the goal of returning them to_**
**_active duty. For those who cannot continue wearing the_**
**_uniform, the Transition Group will provide personalized,_**
**_guided support centred on the unique situation and needs_**
**_of individual members. This is critical to the well-being of_**
**_our personnel._**

As we work to help those who are leaving military life,

we are fully committed to collaborating with Veterans
Affairs Canada to close any remaining gaps between the
support and services offered by our respective organizations
to ensure our members continue to receive the uninter­
rupted care and attention they need and deserve. Leaving
the Canadian Armed Forces is a major life change and
can be stressful for members and their loved ones. Working
with the members and their families, the professional
staff of the Canadian Armed Forces Transition Group will
ensure they are ready for the changes ahead of them.


###### NEW INITIATIVES

To better meet the needs of all retiring personnel,
including the ill and injured, the Defence team will:

25. Establish a Personnel Administration Branch of

experts in military human resources and person­
nel administration to focus and improve military
human resource services to all Canadian Armed
Forces members.

26. Allocate some of the growth in the Medical

Services Branch to support transition care.

27. Create a new Canadian Armed Forces Transition

Group that provides support to all members to
seamlessly transition to post-military life. This
Group, commanded by a General Officer and
staffed from experts in human resources and
personnel administration, will be approximately
1,200 personnel strong and include specialized
staff and holding positions for ill and injured who
are preparing to return to duty or transition out
of the Canadian Armed Forces. The Group will
provide a fully engaged, personalized, guided
support to transition all Canadian Armed Forces
members, with special care and attention being
provided to those who are ill or injured, including
those with psychological or critical stress injuries.

28. Ensure that all benefits will be in place before a

member transitions to post-military life.

# 2 LONG-TERM INVESTMENTS TO ENHANCE

### THE CANADIAN ARMED FORCES’

 CAPABILITIES AND CAPACITY TO SUPPORT

 PEACE AND SECURITY 


The scale of our re-investment in the Canadian Armed
Forces is significant. This long-term investment is meant
to modernize, renew and restore this vital national insti­
tution and provide our women and men in uniform with
the modern tools they need to succeed in – and return
home safely from – operations.

In their valour, competence, compassion and humani­

tarianism, this country’s sailors, soldiers, and airwomen
and men exemplify the best of what it means to be Cana­
dian. They bear the standard for our country abroad, in
supporting peace and security, and at home, in times of
natural disaster. They shoulder the interlinked burdens of
keeping us safe, promoting our values, and helping make
the world a better place.

For all these reasons, Canadians want a military that

is agile, highly trained, superbly equipped, capable and
professional. This policy delivers exactly that. To ensure
the Canadian Armed Forces has the people and capa­
bilities it needs to succeed, the Government of Canada
is committed to the largest defence modernization effort
in decades. This policy contains a comprehensive and
funded plan to invest in key emerging domains while
simultaneously recapitalizing the core capabilities of the
Royal Canadian Navy, the Canadian Army, and the Royal
Canadian Air Force.

The Canadian Armed Forces will grow by 3,500 (to

71,500 total) military personnel. This will allow us to
expand in important areas such space and cyber, intelli­
gence and targeting, and support to the health and welfare
of military personnel. These investments will provide the
necessary flexibility to enable the Canadian Armed Forces
to operate across the spectrum of conflict, enable interop­
erability with Canada’s allies, and maintain an operational
advantage over the threats of today and tomorrow.


The investments in equipment and materiel necessary

to underwrite Canada’s future force will match the signifi­
cant investment in its personnel. The Royal Canadian
Navy will acquire 15 Canadian Surface Combatant ships
to replace its existing frigates and retired destroyers. This
policy now provides the full funding for all 15 ships; this
will be one of the largest acquisitions in Canadian ship­
building history and makes up a core part of the National
Shipbuilding Strategy (NSS).

The Canadian Army will undergo a recapitalization

of much of its land combat capabilities and its aging
vehicle fleets while modernizing its command and control
systems. Additionally, it will expand its light forces capa­
bility which will allow it to be more adaptable in complex
operational theatres.


-----

The Royal Canadian Air Force will acquire 88 future

fighter aircraft to enforce Canada’s sovereignty and to
meet Canada’s NORAD and NATO commitments, while
recapitalizing many of its existing aircraft fleets such as
the CP-140 Aurora anti-submarine warfare and surveil­
lance aircraft.

Finally, the Canadian Special Operations Forces

Command will expand its operational capacity and invest
in capabilities that enable Canada’s rapidly deployable and
agile Special Forces to provide their unique skills both at
home and abroad. In addition to these key investments,
this defence policy identifies a number of capability areas
in the Reserve Force which will also be funded.

The Canadian Armed Forces has taken great strides

in recent years to improve the overall integration of
Canada’s military capabilities, as well as the interaction
with other government departments, to ensure the secu­
rity and defence of Canada. The Canadian Armed Forces
will leverage the unique characteristics of naval, army, air,
and special operations forces and better integrate them to
ensure continued Canadian and allied military advantage.
The continued integration of Primary Reserve training and
equipment with the Regular Force has also contributed
substantially to Canadian Armed Forces operations. As
our capabilities evolve, the skills inherent in the Reserve
Force will produce full-time capabilities through parttime service.


###### ROYAL CANADIAN NAVY

Naval forces provide Canada with a responsive and agile
means to respond across a wide spectrum of maritime situ­
ations, and serve as an instrument of national power on
the international stage. Canada possesses a vast maritime
estate – it has the world’s longest coastline, the second
largest continental shelf, and the fifth largest Exclusive
Economic Zone in the world. This calls for naval forces
that are designed and structured to operate in some of
the most extreme ocean conditions. Further, since a large
part of Canada’s prosperity relies on the maintenance of
free and open access to international waters for trade and
commerce, Canada requires a Navy that is organized and
sized to project power responsively and effectively far
from Canada’s shores.

This Blue Water Navy requires a balanced mix of plat­

forms, including submarines, surface combatants, support
ships and patrol vessels, in sufficient quantities to meet our
domestic and international needs. A fleet built around an
ability to deploy and sustain two naval task groups, each
composed of up to four combatants and a joint support
ship, provides Canada with a relevant contribution to any
international mission while assuring the ability to moni­
tor our own ocean estate and contribute to the security
of North America. The Royal Canadian Navy’s ability
to establish persistent presence, be self-sustaining at sea,
refocus rapidly from one type of mission to another, and
interdict threats far from national territory and populated
areas represents a vital component of Canada’s prosperity,
security, and defence.

The Royal Canadian Navy’s flexibility, global reach, and

staying power, allow it to succeed across a broad mission
set: combat operations, rapid provision of humanitarian
assistance and disaster relief to those in need, defence diplo­
macy, and collaborating with other government depart­
ments and agencies on a daily basis in support of domestic
defence and security.

Underpinning this naval capability will be a continued

emphasis on building and maintaining a picture of what
is happening in our own waters and increasingly over­
seas – as a means to anticipate and respond to threats,
in cooperation with other government departments and
agencies as appropriate, as well as our allies. Armed with
better awareness and understanding, the Royal Canadian
Navy must be able to adapt to an ever-changing maritime
environment. The Maritime Tactical Operations Group
(MTOG) boarding team capability is an example of
this adaptability – it provides an innovative response to
the changing nature of threats associated with interdict­
ing vessels at sea. In addition, as the complexity of naval


###### NATIONAL SHIPBUILDING STRATEGY

The National Shipbuilding Strategy is a long-term
project to renew Canada’s federal fleet of combat
and non-combat vessels. Partnerships were formed
with two Canadian shipyards to deliver much-needed
vessels to the Royal Canadian Navy and the Canadian
Coast Guard. The Strategy provides jobs and benefits
to Canadians and rebuilds our country’s industry.


-----

operations increases in the modern threat environment,
the Navy will continue to pursue interoperability with
allied capabilities. This will ensure that Canada’s fleet can
work seamlessly with allies and is positioned to directly
leverage these capabilities, increasing its own effectiveness
and bolstering credible joint and allied action.

With new investment, Canada’s Navy will be capable

of meeting the anticipated defence and security challenges
of the coming decades. Principal among the challenges
at home is the need to operate in the Arctic, alongside
the Canadian Coast Guard, and alongside allied partners.


Key to this is the Arctic and Offshore Patrol Ship (AOPS)
project, which is part of the National Shipbuilding Strate­
gy and involves the delivery of five to six ice-capable ships
to the Royal Canadian Navy. AOPS will provide armed,
sea-borne surveillance of Canadian waters, including in
the Arctic. They will enforce sovereignty, cooperating
with partners, at home and abroad, and will provide the
Government of Canada with awareness of activities in
Canada’s waters.

Beyond Canada’s shores, the capability to undertake

peace operations, including effectively rendering humani­
tarian assistance and relieving distress, will be a require­
ment for the Royal Canadian Navy. Canada’s naval forces
will also be positioned to contribute meaningfully to joint
action ashore and support the sustainment of joint opera­
tions from sea, while preserving the ability to defend its
own freedom of action through naval combat operations.
The multi-purpose nature and versatility of this fleet, both
independently and as part of an allied or coalition Task
Force, allows Canada to rapidly deploy credible naval
forces worldwide, on short notice.


###### A NAVAL TASK GROUP

The Naval Task Group is the core Royal Canadian Navy
operating concept. Composed of up to four surface
combatants and a joint support ship, and supple­
mented where warranted by a submarine, it brings
with it the full breadth of combat capability, force
enablers, specialized teams, maritime helicopters, and
remotely piloted systems. Configured and crewed to
provide its own command and control, a Naval Task
Group can lead allied or coalition forces for sustained
periods, anywhere in the world.

With the Naval Task Group at its core, the Royal Cana­
dian Navy will be structured to sustain a major inter­
national operation, while retaining sufficient combat­
ant capacity for minor operations and/or response to
maritime security taskings at home. In addition, the
Royal Canadian Navy will have the capacity to main­
tain a routine presence in Canada’s three oceans and
contribute to operations in support of North American
security, including in the Caribbean.

The fleet size of 15 Canadian Surface Combatants,
complemented by two Joint Support Ships, and four
Victoria-class submarines provides the necessary
fleet mix and capacity to deploy forces responsively,
prepare follow-on forces effectively, and conduct
maintenance efficiently.

###### CANADIAN ARMY

The Canadian Army is a highly professional force consist­
ing of a fully integrated Regular Force, Army Reserve,
Canadian Rangers, and civilian personnel. Canadian
soldiers train to maintain readiness and develop their
high-end war-fighting skills. Experience shows that high­
ly trained, versatile and well-equipped combat forces can
rapidly adapt to humanitarian assistance, disaster relief or
peace operations.

The Canadian Army is agile, scalable and responsive,

providing the Government with a range of military capa­
bilities on land. The Army can deploy as little as a single
individual to perform tasks such as capacity building,
and it has the depth to permanently shape the security
environment through effective deterrence of threats and
ultimately, with a critical mass of troops on the ground,
to prevail in the most difficult circumstances – combat
with an advanced adversary. The flexibility to support
small missions while remaining ready to conduct large
operations is made possible by the brigade group struc­
ture of the Army. It is only at this level that it is possible


to execute integrated joint operations with the rest of
the Canadian Armed Forces, other government depart­
ments, NATO and other allies and partner forces, and
non-governmental organizations.

The Army’s operational effectiveness relies on realistic,

challenging and regular training up to the brigade grouplevel. This ensures that deployed Army formations can
succeed in any environment regardless of condition.

To adapt to the changing security environment, the

Army’s capabilities must allow for efficient and effective
communication, command and control; intelligence,
surveillance and reconnaissance; manoeuvre; the applica­
tion of firepower; and sustainment. Maintaining the proper
mix of combat capabilities, the ability to operate jointly
with the rest of the Canadian military and in concert with
key allies and partners is crucial for the Army’s success.

Furthermore, each soldier is an integral component

in any task-force, able to anticipate conditions on the
ground, provide and receive information and intelligence
to and from higher levels, and contribute to taking action
at the right time and place in order to achieve mission
objectives. All of these capabilities must be networked and
integrated, starting with the individual systems carried by
each soldier.

Fundamental to future effectiveness as a combat-ready

force, the Canadian Army will recapitalize many core
capabilities, such as command, control and communica­
tions systems, weapons and soldier night vision systems,
and logistic vehicle fleets. The Canadian Army will
continue to pursue investment in war-fighting capabilities
such as ground-based air defence, bridge and gap crossing
equipment, anti-tank guided missile systems, and vehicles
to better operate in Canada’s north. These investments in
the Canadian Army will further improve interoperability
with the Royal Canadian Air Force, Royal Canadian Navy,
Special Operations Forces, and Canada’s allies and part­
ners, while maintaining its operational advantage over
potential adversaries.


###### THE BRIGADE GROUP

The Army trains to fight at the brigade group-level.
This is the minimum level at which it is possible to
execute joint campaigns while integrating various
components, be they from another service, govern­
ment department, non-governmental organization,
or coalition partner. The brigade group consists of
approximately 4,800 soldiers, organized in eight major
units generally including Artillery, Armour, Infantry,
Engineer, and Combat Service Support organizations.
Combinations of these units operate together in “bat­
tle groups” to provide the joint force with the requi­
site firepower, mobility, protection, sustainment, and
command and control functions to effectively coordi­
nate their employment.

intelligence, surveillance and reconnaissance
systems.

43. Acquire all-terrain vehicles, snowmobiles and

larger tracked semi-amphibious utility vehicles
optimized for use in the Arctic environment.

###### ROYAL CANADIAN AIR FORCE

The Royal Canadian Air Force is an agile and integrated
force whose reach and power is essential to Canadian
Armed Forces operations at home and abroad. Given the
vastness of Canada’s territory, it is vitally important for the
Canadian Armed Forces to be able to operate throughout
Canada on very short notice – the Air Force makes this
possible. This strategic reach is also a critical enabler of
Canadian Armed Forces global expeditionary operations,
enabling joint action through control of the air, force
protection, surveillance and reconnaissance, air mobility,
and air attack. As space-based capabilities become evermore important for security and defence, the Royal Cana­
dian Air Force will take on an increasingly important role
coordinating and overseeing the defence space program.
The Air Force can be task tailored and integrated in a


networked force. Every Royal Canadian Air Force plat­
form, be it piloted, remotely piloted or space-based, also
acts as a sensor, ensuring that information and intelligence
gets to decision-makers in a timely fashion.

The Royal Canadian Air Force generates space-based

and aviation surveillance of Canadian territory and its
approaches; maintains 24/7 aerial search and rescue
response capabilities; and assists civil authorities in
responding to a wide range of challenges and threats, from
natural disasters to terrorist attacks. Through NORAD,
the Royal Canadian Air Force makes substantial contribu­
tions to continental defence, generating the vital capabili­
ties required to detect, deter, and defeat threats to both
Canada and North America.


###### THE ROYAL CANADIAN AIR FORCE FIGHTER REPLACEMENT

In order to counter today’s evolving threat environment
and remain highly interoperable with its allies and key
operational partners, Canada will procure a fighter ca­
pability of 88 jets to replace the aging CF-18 fleet.

Military threats across a range of systems such as
advanced fighters and anti-access area denial (A2AD)
surface-to-air missile systems, in addition to evolving
cyber threats, are making the environment within
which the Canadian Armed Forces operates more lethal
and complex. As such, the Canadian Armed Forces
requires a fighter fleet that is capable, upgradeable,
resilient and interoperable with our allies and partners
to ensure Canada continues to meet its NORAD and
NATO commitments in the future. The fighter aircraft
fleet is a critical Canadian Armed Forces capability
necessary to enforce Canada’s sovereignty, enable
continental security, and contribute to international
peace and stability.

In addition to the quality of the fighter capability required,
the Royal Canadian Air Force requires sufficient numbers


of fighter aircraft to ensure control of Canada’s vast
airspace, while maintaining an ability to simultaneously
contribute to international operations, conduct pilot
training, and to allow for maintenance and repair. The
fleet size of 88 fighter aircraft will provide the necessary
number of aircraft to fulfill Canada’s commitments,
including maintenance and readiness training.

###### INTERIM FIGHTER CAPABILITY

At the time of publication, the Government of Canada
is continuing to explore the potential acquisition of an
interim aircraft to supplement the CF-18 fighter aircraft
fleet until the completion of the transition to the perma­
nent replacement aircraft (see above).

This interim capacity would reduce the risk associated
with relying exclusively on the aging CF-18 fleet and
could help mitigate the capability gap so that Canada
can generate sufficient mission ready aircraft to meet
its domestic and international obligations until the
permanent replacement is fully operational.


-----

The Royal Canadian Air Force also plays a large role

in all Canadian deployed operations and is in high
demand for NATO, United Nations (UN) peacekeeping,
and other coalition missions contributing to international
peace and security. Therefore, Royal Canadian Air Force
space-based and aviation capabilities must be multipurpose – equally relevant to domestic and international
operations, capable of incorporating and adapting to the
latest technology, integrated with all of the capabilities
in the Canadian Armed Forces, and interoperable with
core allies. These missions have often relied heavily on the
strategic and tactical air transport capability provided by
the C-17 and C-130J fleets.

In addition, conducting operations from its bases in

Canada, the Royal Canadian Air Force will be able to
operate from prepared or austere airfields anywhere in
the world with an Air Task Force composed of a range of
aircraft types.

To continue to meet Canada’s defence needs, the Royal

Canadian Air Force must increase interoperability with its
key partners and core allies. It will need to sustain exist­
ing capacity and continue to acquire modern aerospace
capabilities that have an operational advantage in relation
to present and future potential adversaries. Future aero­
space capabilities must provide for the seamless integration
with partners and sharing of information. The Royal
Canadian Air Force must be capable of contributing to
and exploiting a system-of-systems approach that now
defines most modern military forces.

Moreover, the effectiveness of the Royal Canadian

Air Force requires continued investment in professional
development and education programs focused on the
theory and practical application of aerospace power,
training programs and systems of the highest calibre, and
an institutional culture placing the highest value on the
maintenance of air safety and airworthiness standards.
Taken together, this assures the agility and flexibility of
the Air Force.


###### INVESTMENTS IN THE ROYAL CANADIAN AIR FORCE

44. Replace the CF-18 fleet with 88 advanced fighter

aircraft to improve Canadian Armed Forces air
control and air attack capability.

45. Acquire space capabilities meant to improve

situational awareness and targeting, including:

allied space-based systems (surveillance of space);
and, space-based systems that will enhance and
improve tactical narrow- and wide-band commu­
nications globally, including throughout Canada’s
Arctic region.

###### CANADIAN SPECIAL OPERATIONS
 FORCES COMMAND

Special Operations Forces are small, highly skilled, adapt­
able, multi-purpose forces held at very high readiness
levels. Special Operations Forces are employed in situa­
tions that pose an imminent threat to national interests,
where the use of larger military forces is inappropriate or
undesirable, in operational environments where access is
limited, and against high-value targets.

These situations benefit from small, well-planned

or precision tactical operations. Such activities include:
domestic and international counter-terrorist response,
discrete intelligence collection, surveillance and recon­
naissance activities, specialized capacity building to assist
allied host nation forces, and immediate reaction in
response to emergent or imminent threats. Flexible, scale­
able Special Operations Task Forces often play a role in
longer-term military missions but the limited numbers
of highly skilled individuals at the heart of such forces
typically deploy for limited durations of time.

Canada’s Special Operations Forces structure is lean.

It consists of a headquarters commanding Joint Task
Force 2 (JTF 2) – Canada’s military counter-terrorism
unit; the Canadian Joint Incident Response Unit (CJIRU)
– Canada’s military Chemical, Biological, Radiological
and Nuclear detection and response unit; the Canadian
Special Operations Regiment; the Special Operations
Aviation Squadron; and the Canadian Special Operations
Training Centre.

At its core, Canada’s Special Operations Forces are

focused on a cooperative joint, inter-agency, and multi­
national approach to operations. In order to meet future
challenges, the Canadian Special Operations Forces
Command will continue this cooperation to support
government decision-making in security situations,
including counter-terrorism efforts. Additionally, the
Canadian Special Operations Forces Command will
support international peace and security missions, and
contribute to and harness the ‘Global Special Operations


Forces Network’ consisting of allied Special Operations
Forces.

The lean nature and unique characteristics of Canada’s

Special Operations Forces require sustained and tailored
investment to ensure continuity and effectiveness over the
long-term.


###### INVESTMENTS IN SPECIAL
 OPERATIONS FORCES

57. Acquire airborne Intelligence, Surveillance and

Reconnaissance platforms.

58. Recapitalize existing commercial pattern, SUV
type armoured vehicles.

Forces Command, Control and Communications
information systems, and computer defence
networks.

60. Enhance next generation Special Operations

Forces integrated soldier system equipment,
land mobility, and maritime mobility platforms
and fighting vehicle platforms.

61. Increase Special Operations Forces by 605 per­

sonnel.


-----

###### CANADIAN ARMED FORCES JOINT
 CAPABILITIES

Joint capabilities are generally those that facilitate the
enhanced command and control of deployed Canadian
Armed Forces elements and are fundamental to the
Canadian Armed Forces’ ability to anticipate, adapt and
act in response to Government of Canada priorities.

The uncertainty and volatility of the security environ­

ment, the evolution of technology, and the time required
for the development of the people, equipment, systems,
and methods that comprise military capability require
consistent, sustained, predictable investment. The capa­


bility investments outlined in this policy will ensure the
Canadian Armed Forces’ preparedness for the future
through the development, sustainment and enhance­
ment of the core combat and critical enabling capabilities
necessary for an integrated, innovative, flexible, adaptable,
and interoperable force.

These investments will provide the Government of

Canada and Canadians with a capable, adaptable military
able to promote and protect Canadian interests and values
at home and abroad.


###### INVESTMENTS IN JOINT CAPABILITIES

62. Acquire joint command and control systems and

equipment, specifically for integrated information
technology and communications.

63. Acquire joint signals intelligence capabilities

that improve the military’s ability to collect and
exploit electronic signals intelligence on expedi­
tionary operations.

Headquarters and Signals Regiment, including
the portable structures that house the head­
quarters when deployed and the equipment
employed by that headquarters for command,
control, and communications.

65. Improve cryptographic capabilities, information

operations capabilities, and cyber capabilities to
include: cyber security and situational awareness
projects, cyber threat identification and response,
and the development of military-specific infor­
mation operations and offensive cyber operations
capabilities able to target, exploit, influence, and
attack in support of military operations.

66. Improve Chemical, Biological, Radiological,

Nuclear, and Explosive detection and response
capabilities.

# 3 FIXING DEFENCE FUNDING


###### STABLE, PREDICTABLE, REALISTIC FUNDING

The vision and new initiatives set out in _Strong, Secure,_
_Engaged are backed by a long-term funding commitment_
and model that fully provide the resources for implemen­
tation.

To meet Canada’s defence needs at home and abroad,

the Government will grow annual defence spending over
the next 10 years from $17.1 billion in 2016-17 to $24.6
billion in 2026-27 on an accrual basis. This translates to
a rise in annual defence spending on a cash basis from
$18.9 billion in 2016-17 to $32.7 billion in 2026-27, an
increase of over 70 percent. The total funding available to
Defence over the next 20 years will be $497.0 billion on an
accrual basis, or $553.0 billion on a cash basis (Table 1).
Total forecasted defence spending as a percentage of gross
domestic product is expected to reach 1.40 percent by
2024-25. This level of funding is affordable, achievable,
and has been informed by a rigorous, evidence-based
analysis of Canada’s defence needs and the resources
required to effectively deliver upon them over a 20-year
horizon.

Over the next 20 years, _Strong, Secure, Engaged_

includes new funding for defence of $48.9 billion on an
accrual basis, or $62.3 billion on a cash basis.

Defence investments will no longer be only planned in

the first time, this model is transparent, rigorously costed,
and fully funded, including not just acquisition costs, but
also operating and sustainment costs of new equipment.
In accordance with long-standing practice, the Govern­
ment of Canada will take the funding decisions neces­
sary for future military deployments as well as decisions
related to continental defence and NORAD moderniza­
tion. Additional funding may be approved in the future in
order to ensure the Canadian Armed Forces can continue
to fulfill its mandate in an evolving environment.

The Canadian Armed Forces must be able to plan well

into the future. This policy ensures it can.

This funding is realistic and will provide the stability

and certainty required to make defence investments that
meet today’s needs while also planning for the future.

###### INVESTING IN DEFENCE

The funding commitment is composed of two separate
components, capital investments and operating funding,
further sub-categorized as follows:

 - Capital Investments – Acquisition – Costs related

to the procurement of capital assets. Capital assets
include equipment, infrastructure and information
management/information technology-related equip­
ment.

 - Operating Funding – Operating and Sustainment –

Costs include: personnel (Regular, Reserve and defence
civilians); operating, including operating and sustain­
ment costs for capital assets, both those currently in
service and future acquisitions (training, domestic
and deployed operations and other activities); and
infrastructure (including maintenance, utilities and
Payment in Lieu of Taxes (PILT)).

 - Operating Funding – Additional Personnel – The

incremental salary and operating costs attributed to
the planned growth of 3,500 Regular Force personnel,
1,500 Reserve Force personnel and 1,150 defence
civilians.

 - Operating Funding – New Initiatives - Each initiative

had a unique cost model created based on existing
Defence costing frameworks and procedures. Four
specific initiatives have been included in this policy:
Defence Engagement Program Expansion; the Inno­
vation for Defence Excellence and Security (IDEaS)
initiative; Reserves – Enhanced Roles, Capability and
Benefits; and the Total Health and Wellness Strategy.


###### ENSURING EFFECTIVE MANAGEMENT OF THE DEFENCE BUDGET

National Defence is responsible for the largest capital
budget of any federal institution and its budget process
is complex. As a vestige of history, National Defence
effectively had two separate budgets.

1. Like all federal departments, National Defence is

allocated funding on a cash basis through the Parlia­
mentary Estimates process. While National Defence
does have visibility on the level of funding that it
would receive in the future, this budget could be
affected based on yearly budget decisions, the level
and number of international military missions, and
changes to costs and timing of equipment acquisitions.
This funding was used to pay annual operating costs
(salaries, administration, building costs), the purchase
of some capital equipment and infrastructure, and the
costs of operating and maintaining this equipment.

2. In 2005-06, a new and separate part of National

Defence’s budget was created using the accrual basis
of accounting – a standard and accepted accounting
method for the management of capital assets. This
new source of funds was intended to be the long-term,
predictable source of funds to be used for the acquisi­
tion and operation and maintenance of major new
equipment, as well as force expansion.

Under this old model, the planning of the capital

program was managed on both a cash and accrual basis.
Further, some operating costs were covered by the cash
budget, while others were sourced from the accrual
budget. This introduced significant complexity in planning
for major equipment projects, which was a fundamental
challenge of large procurements of the past. Funding
was announced for the purchase of new equipment such
as aircraft and ships, but the life-cycle costs, including
operating costs, were not adequately planned for in the
procurement of equipment.

This new policy introduces some important changes

to how the defence budget is managed to ensure that the
Defence team has the flexibility to effectively manage
key investments in defence capability. With this change,
the Defence team and Canadians will have a full 20-year
view of capital investments under a single, consolidated
defence budget. A simplified process will be put into effect
for the management and planning of capital expenditures.
For the first time, the management of all funding related
to the acquisition of all capital assets will be on a purely
accrual basis, which accounts for the project development
and acquisition cost of the equipment over the expected
life of the asset. In addition, the operating and sustainment


-----

costs for the equipment will be earmarked as part of the
planning process. This will enable better long-term planning
of defence capabilities and help enhance the transparency
of defence fiscal planning with Parliament.

In total, Strong, Secure, Engaged will invest an additional

$48.9 billion over the next 20 years on an accrual basis
– $33.8 billion for the acquisition of capital assets and
$15.1 billion for operating requirements. Over this time
period (2017-18 to 2036-37) total defence funding on an
accrual basis is estimated to be $497.0 billion not including
the costs of military operations (Figure 1).

Specifically, this additional funding will be coupled

with four reforms:

1. Transformation of the defence funding model that

clearly and transparently identifies the investments
required to acquire new assets (capital budget) and
those funds required to conduct the business of
defence (operating budget).

2. Reform of Canada’s procurement model and adoption

of life-cycle costing to ensure the Department of
National Defence has not only the funding to procure
new equipment, but also the funding to maintain and
operate new equipment.

3. Implementation of rigorous costing of major equip­

ment, including through Third-Party Reviews.

4. Publication of the next Defence Investment Plan

in 2018, and further installments every three years
thereafter, to ensure Canadians can clearly understand

Figure 1: Defence Funding – Accrual Basis*

_*Not including future mission costs_


future changes to the budget and to deliver on the
Government’s commitment to transparency, results,
and accountability.

_Strong, Secure, Engaged integrates additional fund­_

ing flexibilities with respect to mission costs. While
some operations are manageable from within the exist­
ing defence budget, for others National Defence will seek
additional funding. This will help preserve the integrity
of the defence budget, and ensure that other important
priorities such as investments in defence capability and
caring for our people and their families are not compro­
mised by the costs of operations.

Moreover, additional funding will be provided for

salary increases related to the renegotiation of collective
agreements for civilian personnel and Treasury Board
approved salary increases for military personnel.

###### REPORTING OF DEFENCE SPENDING - NATO

This policy highlights significant additional investments
by the Government of Canada. This is consistent with the
NATO trend of reversing declining expenditures to meet
the commitments agreed to in the Defence Investment
Pledge. While defence spending is an important part
of ensuring appropriate defence capability, it is not the
most effective measure of fair burden sharing. Within the
Alliance, Canada continues to place a premium on tangi­
ble operational contributions, as well as demonstrating a
commitment and capacity to deploy and sustain personnel
in support of the Alliance.

As part of the Defence Policy Review, Defence

conducted a study to ensure that the methodologies used
by Canada to report defence spending as a percentage of
gross domestic product to NATO were consistent with
the eligibility criteria established by NATO and with
those currently being utilized and reported by our Allies.


The study revealed that Canada has been under
reporting its defence spending. The key factor related to
the under-reporting has been the exclusion of defence
spending that has been incurred by other government
departments. Recent consultations with NATO staff
and our Allies have resulted in a clearer understanding
of Canada’s defence spending. Future reporting will now
include defence spending from other government depart­
ments, such as:

 - payments made directly to veterans;

 - peacekeeping and humanitarian operations;

 - direct information technology support to defence;

 - centrally funded defence personnel costs; and

 - direct program support to defence.

It should be noted that additional expenses related

to services provided by Veterans Affairs Canada are not
currently included. Canada will continue to consult with
NATO officials to ensure that costs reported going forward
are reflective of defence spending in support of NATO.

The investments in Strong, Secure, Engaged decisively

reverse Canada’s declining defence spending in recent
years. Total forecasted defence spending under this poli­
cy is expected to reach 1.40 percent of gross domestic
product by 2024-25. It will also position Canada to
exceed NATO’s target to spend 20 percent of defence
expenditure on major equipment, which under this policy
is forecasted to reach 32.2 percent in 2024-25.

Table 2 identifies the revised defence spending fore­

cast as a percentage of gross domestic product and major
equipment spending as a percentage of defence spending.

###### RIGOROUS COSTING AND
 THIRD-PARTY REVIEW

The stable, realistic defence funding presented in this
policy rests on the foundation of a rigorous, multi-stage,
externally validated, costing process. National Defence
worked with external global defence costing experts from
Deloitte, who brought their expertise gained from defence
reviews in allied nations, to provide advice and support
to this unprecedented process. All costing methodologies
to support the vision of _Strong, Secure, Engaged also_
underwent a third-party review conducted by five external
accounting firms. A life-cycle approach was used for both
current and future major equipment requirements to take
into account the full costs of use over the expected life
of the equipment, such as supporting infrastructure,
training, maintenance and operating costs.

###### ENSURING TRANSPARENCY OF
 THE DEFENCE BUDGET

To deliver on the Government’s commitment to transpar­
ency, results and accountability, the Government of Canada
will publish the next Defence Investment Plan in 2018, and
further plans thereafter. It will provide important planning
direction to guide the major investments that provide the
Canadian Armed Forces with the core capability to carry
out its mandate. In particular, the Defence Investment


Plan identifies major capital equipment and infrastructure
spending and investments over $20 million for goods and
services over a five-year period. This will provide a more
transparent and important mechanism to demonstrate
prudent stewardship of public resources. Further informa­
tion on how the Defence team plans to ensure the transpar­
ency of the defence budget is provided at Annex A.

# 4 GLOBAL CONTEXT

###### KEY TRENDS

Canada has a long-standing, honourable tradition of robust
engagement in support of global stability, peace and pros­
perity. We are uniquely positioned now to further this role.
Arguably, our engagement has never been more necessary,
or valued by our international allies and partners.

We live in a time when economic growth has lifted

billions from poverty. But fragile and conflict-affected states
have been excluded from many of these gains. Economic
inequality is rising, worldwide. This has brought with it
rising instability.

Canada is not immune from these concerns, and we

must be part of the solution – a force for security, stability,
prosperity and social justice in the world.

Violent extremism is a global scourge that, left


unchecked, can undermine civil society and destabilize
entire regions. It must be steadfastly opposed through
concerted action spanning intelligence, counter-radical­
ization, development, and the use of hard power. In the face
of hateful ideologies and attacks on our values and way of
life, Canada will respond with unwavering strength.

Social media and smart technology have transformed

every aspect of daily life, conferring great benefits on the
people it connects, worldwide. But much greater access to
communications technology has simultaneously fostered
new vulnerabilities, which we are called to address.

When large populations flee their homes in a desper­

ate search for a better life, mass migration can undermine
states and lead to humanitarian emergencies. But when
managed properly, emigration and immigration are forces
for diversity, for economic growth and vitality in the host
countries. We Canadians know this first-hand.

Climate change threatens to disrupt the lives and

livelihoods of millions around the world. It also presents
us with an urgent call to innovate, to foster collective
action, to work hand-in-hand with like-minded partners
around the world to meet this threat and beat it, rather
than stand passively by.


In short, Canada – by virtue of our geography, our

history, our diversity and our natural wealth – is called to
leadership. We have the capacity to help those who live
under the threat of violence, or have been consigned to
protracted refugee status. We can reach out to those who
suffer from weak governance. We can be a force for stability
in the world.

And that is why Canada’s ability to field a highly

trained, professional, well-equipped military is so vital.
Meeting these enormous collective challenges requires
coordinated action across the whole-of-government –
military capabilities working hand in hand with diplomacy
and development. The right hand supports the left – and
vice-versa.

We have often heard the world needs more Canada.

This policy puts us in a position to make this a reality.

Within this broader context, three key security trends

will continue to shape events: **the evolving balance of**
**power, the changing nature of conflict, and the rapid**
**evolution of technology.**


-----

###### EVOLVING BALANCE OF POWER

Trends in global economic development are shifting the
relative power of states, from the West to the East, and –
to a lesser extent – from the North to the South, creating a
more diffuse environment in which an increasing number
of state and non-state actors exercise influence. This shift
supports positive global change, such as the alleviation
of poverty, and the democratization and empowerment
that often accompany economic development. However,
this shift has also been accompanied by weak governance
and increasing uncertainty. In this era of growing multipolarity, the United States is still unquestionably the only
superpower. China is a rising economic power with an
increasing ability to project influence globally. Russia has
proven its willingness to test the international security
environment. A degree of major power competition has
returned to the international system.

There are also a number of rising regional powers

that are gaining greater influence in international affairs,
particularly as economies in Latin America, Asia, and
Africa continue to grow at a relatively rapid pace. Canada
has a strong interest in supporting the international
system it helped to build, including by fostering new part­
nerships, engaging with emerging powers and promoting
peace around the globe.

###### STATE COMPETITION

As a trading nation and influential member of the G7,
G20, NATO and United Nations, Canada benefits from
global stability underpinned by a rules-based international
order. Recent years have witnessed several challenges.
Russia’s illegal annexation of Crimea is an example that
has carried grave consequences. Activities in the South
China Sea highlight the need for all states in the region
to peacefully manage and resolve disputes in accordance
with international law, and avoid coercion and other
actions that could escalate tension.

The re-emergence of major power competition has

reminded Canada and its allies of the importance of deter­
rence. At its core, deterrence is about discouraging a poten­
tial adversary from doing something harmful before they
do it. A credible military deterrent serves as a diplomatic
tool to help prevent conflict and should be accompanied by
dialogue. NATO Allies and other like-minded states have
been re-examining how to deter a wide spectrum of chal­
lenges to the international order by maintaining advanced
conventional military capabilities that could be used in the
event of a conflict with a “near-peer.” Deterrence has tradi­
tionally focused on conventional and nuclear capabilities,
but the concept is also increasingly relevant to the space
and cyber domains.


###### THE RE-EMERGENCE OF DETERRENCE

Changes in the international environment demand a
new understanding of how and when to lawfully use or
threaten to use military force in support of diplomatic
engagement to manage and shape conflict and inter­
national relations.

The return of major power rivalry, new threats from
non-state actors, and challenges in the space and
cyber domains have returned deterrence to the centre
of defence thinking.

Canada benefits from the deterrent effect provided by
its alliances (e.g., NATO and NORAD), and takes seriously
its responsibility to contribute to efforts to deter aggres­
sion by potential adversaries in all domains.


###### A CHANGING ARCTIC

The Arctic region represents an important international
crossroads where issues of climate change, international
trade, and global security meet. Eight states – Canada,
Denmark, Finland, Iceland, Norway, Russia, Sweden,
and the United States – have territory north of 60[o],
while five of these states border the Arctic Ocean. Arctic
states have long cooperated on economic, environmental,
and safety issues, particularly through the Arctic Council,
the premier body for cooperation in the region. All Arctic
states have an enduring interest in continuing this
productive collaboration.


-----

Climate change, combined with advancements in

technology, is leading to an increasingly accessible Arctic.
A decade ago, few states or firms had the ability to operate
in the Arctic. Today, state and commercial actors from
around the world seek to share in the longer term benefits
of an accessible Arctic. Over time, this interest is expected
to generate a corresponding rise in commercial interest,
research and tourism in and around Canada’s northern
territory. This rise in activity will also bring increased
safety and security demands related to search and rescue
and natural or man-made disasters to which Canada must
be ready to respond.

###### INFLUENCE OF NON-STATE ACTORS

The evolving balance of power has created a more diffuse
environment in which an increasing number of actors can
exercise varying degrees of influence. While states will
remain the most important entities on the global land­
scape, a diverse range of non-state actors add complexity
to the operating environment and can change the scope
and nature of military operations.

Many of these non-state actors, such as non-govern­

mental organizations, philanthropic foundations, respon­
sible corporations, cities, and religious communities play
positive roles that promote peace and address the needs of
vulnerable populations. These actors have helped to address
global health crises, support implementation of the United
Nations’ Sustainable Development goals to increase vacci­
nations against preventable disease and empower women
and girls. The International Campaign to Ban Landmines
is a good example of the progress that can be made when
states and non-state actors unite in common purpose.
States must learn to better partner with and leverage the
benefits these entities can bring to international affairs.

Other non-state actors have a destructive influence.

Terrorist and violent extremist organizations, organized


crime cartels and hacker groups exhibit behaviour that
cannot be easily addressed through the frameworks and
mechanisms that govern state-to-state interaction. Adding
to the more complex security environment, terrorist and
extremist organizations in some regions of the world
have been able to embed themselves in local communi­
ties, blurring the lines between the organizations and the
civilian population. In some cases, those organizations are
viewed by locals as more legitimate than the state, thus
further complicating and impeding state authority. This
dynamic demands that states seek new ways of addressing
borderless threats and mitigating their negative effects.

###### GLOBAL GOVERNANCE

As the relative power of states shifts and new voices gain
importance, existing international institutions need to
adapt to new realities. The efficacy of the international
system rests largely on active engagement by all states.
Ensuring cohesion and maintaining accountability will
be vitally important as new groupings are integrated into
the international system. It is in Canada’s interest that
existing global governance mechanisms, including multi­
lateral organizations and negotiation processes, work
well, remain flexible and adapt to accommodate new
perspectives.

Global governance is undermined when rules are

ignored or norms flouted. North Korea’s ongoing efforts
to advance its nuclear weapons and ballistic missile
programs, including two nuclear tests in 2016 and
numerous ballistic missile tests, show clear disregard for
multiple United Nations Security Council resolutions,
and further demonstrate that North Korea poses a serious
and increasing threat to both regional stability and inter­
national peace and security. Syria’s abhorrent use of
weapons of mass destruction against innocent civilians
– in strict violation of international law and universally
accepted values – remains of grave concern.


-----

###### THE CHANGING NATURE OF CONFLICT

The characteristics of conflict have changed significantly
over the last 10 years – from the underlying causes to the
actors involved and their methods of warfare. During this
period, both state and non-state actors have shown greater
willingness to use violence to achieve political ends, taking
a particular toll on civilians. The Middle East is currently
the most violent region in the world, primarily as a result
of the ongoing conflicts in Syria and Iraq. The thousands
of deaths from the conflict in Ukraine mean that organized
violence has returned to Europe. While many African
states have made impressive progress, others continue to
struggle with conflict and fragility. Demands on United
Nations peace operations have reached historic highs.

###### GROWING COMPLEXITY

A variety of interrelated conditions can trigger or influence
conflicts in unexpected ways. Economic inequality, for
example, can create social unrest with potentially signifi­
cant consequences, including in the West. Large popula­
tions of unemployed youth in particular have been at the
root of instability historically and in today’s environment
they can provide fertile recruiting grounds for violent


Climate change has emerged as a security challenge
that knows no borders.

The increased frequency, severity and magnitude of
extreme weather events all over the world – one of the
most immediate and visible results of climate change
– will likely continue to generate humanitarian crises.

The effects of climate change can also aggravate
existing vulnerabilities, such as weak governance, and
increase resource scarcity, which in turn heightens
tensions and forces migrations.

In Canada, climate change is transforming the Northern
landscape, bringing an evolving set of safety and
security challenges, from greater demand for search
and rescue to increased international attention and
military activity.


extremists. Demographic change overall can have desta­
bilizing effects. Population growth, particularly when
combined with large-scale transition from rural to urban
living, continues to add strain on the world’s cities and
increases competition for resources.

The number of migrants worldwide fleeing economic,

environmental, or conflict-related causes has reached its
highest levels since the Second World War. Such rapid
and forced displacement can strain institutions and test
the resilience of host populations. These factors also tend
to exacerbate the negative consequences of inequality and
marginalization.

In addition to these underlying root causes of conflict,

the effects of climate change can aggravate existing vulner­
abilities, such as weak governance, and exacerbate sources
of tension, such as resource scarcity. The effects of climate
change must therefore be considered through a security lens.


-----

###### THE GREY ZONE AND HYBRID WARFARE

State and non-state actors are increasingly pursuing their
agendas using hybrid methods in the “grey zone” that
exists just below the threshold of armed conflict. Hybrid
methods involve the coordinated application of diplomatic,
informational, cyber, military and economic instruments
to achieve strategic or operational objectives. They often
rely on the deliberate spread of misinformation to sow
confusion and discord in the international community,
create ambiguity and maintain deniability. The use of
hybrid methods increases the potential for misperception
and miscalculation. Hybrid methods are frequently used
to undermine the credibility and legitimacy of a national
government or international alliance. By staying in the
fog of the grey zone, states can influence events in their
favour without triggering outright armed conflict. The
use of hybrid methods presents challenges in terms of
detection, attribution and response for Canada and its
allies, including the understanding and application of
NATO’s Article 5.

###### LINKAGES BETWEEN INTER- AND
 INTRA-STATE CONFLICT

The distinction between inter-and intra-state conflict is
becoming less relevant in terms of intensity. Intra-state
conflicts are increasingly playing out in high threat, high
intensity environments with well-armed, organized groups.
With states using proxies to commit violence on their behalf,
there has been a rise in the last five years in the number of
active intra-state conflicts with external troop involvement.
The conflicts in Syria, Iraq, and eastern Ukraine involve
state-backed militias acting either as reinforcements to
conventional forces or as a method of employing force with
deniability. These conflicts demonstrate how the injection
of state-backed resources can increase the complexity and
intensity of intra-state conflicts.

###### GLOBAL TERRORISM

Terrorism is not a new threat, but it has evolved signifi­
cantly and presents a challenge that cannot be met through
military means alone. The global death toll from terrorism
has more than doubled in the last 20 years, demonstrating
the willingness of non-state actors to employ violence in
the pursuit of their objectives. While this trend reflects
chronic violence largely concentrated in the Middle East
and parts of Africa, events in the past year show that terrorist
groups are extending their reach, sponsoring or inspiring
attacks in major European and North American centres.
Terrorist and violent extremist organizations, notably
al-Qaida and Daesh, are also intent on targeting Western
interests through terrorist attacks and kidnappings.


Successfully disrupting terrorist networks requires a

multi-faceted approach, including efforts to stop the flow
of terrorist financing and counter the communication
strategies employed by violent extremists. The potential
of terrorist groups to spread into ungoverned spaces and
exploit information technology to form alliances and
far-flung trans-regional networks also poses a security
challenge. Countries, like Canada, that are committed
to combating terrorism will require sound intelligence
on potential threats. Traditional concepts of deterrence
may also not apply to non-state actors who calculate risks
and rewards in radically different ways and do not ascribe
to the universal values enshrined in the United Nations
Charter.

At home, Canada remains the target of direct threats

by groups such as Daesh and al-Qaida, and by a small
number of individuals inspired by the violent extremist
ideologies of these groups. Some have engaged in terrorismrelated activities such as promoting violence online, radi­
calizing peers, recruiting and fundraising. Others may
consider travelling abroad to join a terrorist group or conduct
an attack themselves. As part of a broader strategy, counterradicalization efforts and meaningful community outreach
will be essential to diminish the appeal that violent extremist
ideologies have for a small number of individuals.


-----

###### WEAPONS PROLIFERATION

The risk of proliferation of weapons of mass destruction
– chemical, biological, radiological and nuclear-remains
troubling. The proliferation of ballistic missile technology
as a means to deliver these weapons is also a source of
concern. The number of countries with access to ballistic
missile technology, including some with the potential
to reach North America or target Canadian and allied
deployed forces, has increased and is expected to grow
and become more sophisticated. North Korea’s frequent
nuclear and missile tests underscore this point. Diplomatic
efforts have successfully restrained Iran’s nuclear program
through the joint Comprehensive Plan of Action, but
Iran also possesses a considerable number of short
and medium-range ballistic missiles which can pose a


significant threat. The unlawful use of chemical weapons
against civilian and military populations is also a source
of significant concern. The Joint Investigative Mechanism
created by the United Nations and the Organization for
the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons has attributed the
use of chlorine and sulphur mustard weapons in Syria
to both non-state and state actors, including the Syrian
Government. As well, North Korea continues to maintain
a chemical and biological weapon program.

Finally, because of their low cost and accessibility, the

majority of armed conflicts continue to be fought with
small arms and light weapons. An estimated 300,000 to
half a million deaths per year are caused by these weapons,
upwards of 90 percent of victims of armed conflict. Over
1,000 companies from 100 countries produce some aspect
of these arms and though most are transferred legally,
the lack of regulation and controls in many regions where
conflict is occurring has resulted in the development of
illicit markets, making it challenging to stem their prolif­
eration. Canada will reinforce its export controls and help
strengthen international controls on conventional arms
by joining the Arms Trade Treaty.

###### THE CHANGING NATURE OF PEACE OPERATIONS

The violence and instability created by fragile states and
transnational threats have led to horrific human rights
abuses and humanitarian tragedies. In this context, UN
peace operations are an important tool for the international
community to collectively promote peace and security,
including by increasing efforts to prevent conflict in the
first place and by helping countries emerging from conflict
achieve enduring peace.


-----

The evolution of UN peace operations over the last

three decades reflects the changing nature of the conflicts
to which these operations respond. The majority of UN
missions are being deployed into complex political and
security environments. They operate in difficult conditions
and with robust, multi-dimensional mandates. Indeed,
two-thirds of peacekeepers now operate in active conflict
zones. As such, peace operations are now regularly tasked
with using force to protect populations at risk and helping
to bring about the conditions necessary for ending conflict.

Operating in this context has brought new challenges.

UN missions too often lack the means required to deliver
on their mandates. Canada is well-placed to help fill these
gaps. Our specialized capabilities and expertise can play a
critical role in strengthening the effectiveness of missions
on the ground, supporting peace processes and postconflict peacebuilding, and improving the training avail­
able to other contributing countries. Canada can also help
improve the overall management of peace operations by
enhancing the UN’s capacity to provide senior leadership
and direction from headquarters.

UN peace operations also advance Canadian values

and interests. They play a critical role in advancing democ­
racy, upholding human rights, and delivering support to
the vulnerable and marginalized communities that need
it most. As part of a feminist approach to international
policy, Canada is committed to working with the UN to end
conflict-related sexual violence and the use of child soldiers.
This includes advancing the implementation of United
Nations Security Council Resolution 1325 on Women,
Peace and Security, and ensuring UN peacekeepers are held
accountable for meeting the highest standards of conduct.


###### RAPID EVOLUTION OF TECHNOLOGY

The information revolution is one of the key drivers of
many of the most exciting opportunities in the world.
Modern militaries rely on networks and data to plan and
carry out missions. Much of what gives Western forces
their technological and tactical advantage stems from
space-enabled systems, and agile information management
and technology tools to aggregate and manipulate large
quantities of data.

Technological developments point to a future of

defence that is expected to be vastly different than today,
with a greater emphasis on information technologies, data
analytics, deep learning, autonomous systems, advance­
ments in the electromagnetic and cyber domains, as well
as a range of transformative technologies, from quantum
computing to synthetic biology. Any number of these
advances has the potential to change the fundamental
nature of military operations. The rapid pace of techno­
logical change will also require that domestic and interna­
tional legal and governance systems adapt in an effective
and timely manner.

Canada is committed to employing new technological

capabilities in a manner that rigorously respects all appli­
cable domestic and international law, is subject to proven
checks and balances, and ensures full oversight and
accountability. As a country that has led several successful
efforts to advance human rights and establish new inter­
national norms, Canada is also well-placed to advocate
among international partners for the highest standards for
the use of cyber, space, and remotely piloted systems.


-----

###### THE CYBER DOMAIN

The internet was not originally designed with security
in mind, but as an open system to allow for the rapid
exchange of data. Technological advances have opened
the cyber domain to a variety of state and non-state
actors. Terrorist networks, for example, are already using
cyberspace to support their recruitment, fundraising, and
propaganda activities, and are simultaneously seeking to
exploit Western dependence on cyber systems.

The most sophisticated cyber threats come from

the intelligence and military services of foreign states.
Technologically-advanced governments, their militaries,
and private businesses are vulnerable to state-sponsored
cyber espionage and disruptive cyber operations. This
threat can be expected to grow in the coming years.
Addressing the threat is complicated by the difficulties
involved in identifying the source of cyber attacks with
certainty and the jurisdictional challenges caused by the
possible remoteness of cyber attacks.

In the military context, while the use of cyberspace

has become crucial to operations, potential adversaries,
including state proxies and non-state actors, are rapidly
developing cyber means to exploit the vulnerabilities
inherent in the C4ISR systems (command, control,
communications, computers, intelligence, surveillance,
reconnaissance) on which militaries depend, as well as
other operational technologies, such as weapons systems.

###### THE SPACE DOMAIN

Satellites underpin an increasing range of daily activities,
including by providing the “time stamp” function for
ATMs and stock exchanges, coordinating air traffic control
and “just in time” delivery of goods, and supporting the
operation of cell phones and television. Space-based assets
are critical for modern militaries. Satellites provide support
across all operations – from humanitarian assistance
and disaster response, to peace support, and combat. They
are instrumental for navigation, communications and
intelligence.

The evolving space environment is often characterized

as being congested, competitive, and contested.

Increasing congestion means that the risk of collision

between satellites and other orbiting spacecraft or debris
continues to rise, as more objects are launched into orbit.
Space is now congested to the point where orbital debris
poses a real and increasing hazard to day-to-day operations
in space, and this problem only stands to increase with the
proliferation of micro and small satellites being launched


-----

by commercial space actors. The rigours of operating
in the space environment present their own challenges,
including harmful radiation and adverse space weather,
which can degrade satellite functionality over time.

Outer space is increasingly competitive. In addition to

the growing number of state-sponsored space programs,
the commercial space industry has grown exponentially
over the last several years. While this has contributed
significantly to the congestion of outer space, it also
presents exciting opportunities for mutually beneficial
collaboration between the public and private sectors.

Finally, space is an increasingly contested environment.

While Canada remains fully committed to the peaceful use
of space, our assets have become potential targets, with
some states developing a range of anti-satellite weapons
(ASATs) that could potentially threaten access to the space
domain. Some countries already have an ability to tempo­
rarily disrupt space-based services, such as the Global
Positioning System (GPS) or satellite communications,
and a smaller number have the ability – or have stated an
interest in the ability – to cause more permanent effects,
including the destruction of satellites. Space-related chal­
lenges are magnified by the fact that the international legal
framework governing outer space continues to evolve in


response to rapid developments. Canada can demonstrate
leadership by promoting the military and civilian norms
of responsible behaviour in space required to ensure the
peaceful use of outer space.


###### IMPLICATIONS FOR CANADA OF A CHANGING SECURITY ENVIRONMENT



- The global security environment transcends national

borders, requiring Canada to help promote peace and
stability abroad in order to maintain security at home.

- In a global security environment defined by complex­

ity and unpredictability, Canada requires an agile,
well-educated, flexible, diverse, and combat-ready
military capable of conducting a wide range of opera­
tions at home and internationally.

- The interrelated nature of global security challenges

puts a premium on deep knowledge and under­
standing. Using a range of analytical tools, Canada
must develop sophisticated awareness of the infor­
mation and operating environment and the human
dimension of conflict to better predict and respond
to crises.

- To keep pace, Canada must develop advanced space

and cyber capabilities, and expand cutting-edge
research and development.

- Canada must continue to be a responsible partner


that adds value to traditional alliances, including
NORAD, NATO, and the Five-Eyes community.

- Canada must balance these fundamental relation­

ships with the need to engage with emerging powers,
particularly in the Asia-Pacific region.

- Canada must address the threat stemming from

terrorism and the actions of violent extremist orga­
nizations, including in ungoverned spaces.

- Recognizing the devastating effects of climate

change, Canada must bolster its ability to respond to
severe weather events and other natural disasters,
both at home and abroad.

- Acknowledging rising international interest in the

Arctic, Canada must enhance its ability to operate in
the North and work closely with allies and partners.

- Canada and the United States must work closely

together on NORAD Modernization in order to defend
North America.

## 5 STRONG, SECURE, ENGAGED – 
 ARTICULATING A NEW VISION 
 FOR DEFENCE


People are at the core of Canada’s new vision for Defence.
Ensuring that our women and men in uniform are prepared
and equipped to succeed on operations, and that they are
fully supported from recruitment through retirement and
beyond, is fundamental to our success.

When they put on the uniform, members of the

Canadian Armed Forces take on an unlimited liability.
Because of the sacrifices that they make day in and day
out, Canada remains among the safest and most secure
countries in the world.

However, the international landscape is shifting under

tremendous pressures, and the current security environ­
ment presents a variety of threats, many that transcend
national borders. Increasingly, instability abroad can have
direct manifestation in Canada.

Thus, defending Canada and Canadian interests not

only demands robust domestic defence but also requires
active engagement abroad.

In recognition of this dynamic, Canada’s defence

policy presents a new strategic vision for defence: Strong,
_Secure, Engaged. This is a vision in which Canada is:_

 - **Strong at home, its sovereignty well defended by a**

Canadian Armed Forces also ready to assist in times
of natural disaster, other emergencies and search and
rescue;

 - **Secure in North America, active in a renewed**

defence partnership in NORAD and with the United
States; and

 - **Engaged in the world, with the Canadian Armed**

Forces doing its part in Canada’s contributions to a
more stable, peaceful world, including through peace
support operations and peacekeeping.

Canada must have a responsive and capable military.

As an instrument of national power, the military is an


important and unique capability that the Government
of Canada can use to advance national interests, promote
Canadian values, and demonstrate leadership in the world.

Most often, Canada’s military action will be applied

as part of a coherent, coordinated, whole-of-government
effort in concert with diplomatic engagement, humani­
tarian and development aid, and other measures. At other
times, the military may be uniquely called upon to act
in Canada’s interests. In all cases, Canadian Armed Forces
activities will comply with domestic and international law.

As a result of this policy, the Canadian Armed Forces

will be prepared and equipped to advance Canadian inter­
national security objectives – from conducting expedi­

partners – and to support our allies where our shared
interests are at stake.

Canada will pursue leadership roles and will prioritize

interoperability in its planning and capability development
to ensure seamless cooperation with allies and partners,
particularly NATO.

The Canadian Armed Forces will be prepared to make

concrete contributions to Canada’s role as a responsible
international actor, particularly through participation
in United Nations peace operations. We will be able to
support conflict prevention, mediation, and post-conflict
reconstruction, with an emphasis on human rights and, in
particular, gender equality.

We will maintain the capacity to provide protection

and relief to the world’s most vulnerable populations,
creating the stability necessary for development and
sustainable peace to take root. We will also foster worldclass expertise for building the capacity and resiliency of
others, and delivering tangible results in those areas.

 ENGAGED in the World

Canada cannot be strong at home without being engaged
in the world.

As a G7 country and founding member of NATO,

Canada has a strong interest in global stability and open
trade, and we will continue to do our part on the interna­
tional stage to protect our interests and support our allies.
Canada’s engagement in the world is also guided by values
of **inclusion, compassion, accountable governance,**
**and respect for diversity and human rights.**


###### CANADIAN VALUES

Canadian international engagement will be guided by
the core Canadian values of inclusion, compassion,
accountable governance, and respect for diversity
and human rights.

The goal of gender equality permeates all of these core
values. These values are consistent with the Canadian
Charter of Rights and Freedoms and international law.

The Canadian military is guided in all of its actions by
these values, from the treatment of its personnel to
the conduct of operations abroad.

The Canadian Armed Forces may be employed to
protect these values when threatened and to promote
them through their actions, including by training part­
ners and capacity building.

# 6 A NEW CANADIAN
 APPROACH TO DEFENCE:
 ANTICIPATE. ADAPT. ACT.


Being strong, secure and engaged in the context of an
extraordinarily complex security environment requires
a fundamentally new, agile, modern and responsible
approach to defence. To deliver tangible results for Canada
at home and abroad, we will launch a range of initiatives
that will allow us to:

**ANTICIPATE and better understand potential**

threats to Canada and Canadian interests so as to enhance
our ability to identify, prevent or prepare for, and respond
to a wide range of contingencies;

**ADAPT proactively to emerging challenges by harness­**

ing new technologies, fostering a resilient workforce, and
leveraging innovation, knowledge, and new ways of doing
business; and

**ACT with decisive military capability across the spec­**

trum of operations to defend Canada, protect Canadian
interests and values, and contribute to global stability.

###### ANTICIPATE

Accurate, timely information is a critical commodity
for the Defence team and the other federal departments
with which it works. The ability to collect, understand
and disseminate relevant information and intelligence has
become fundamental to the military’s ability to succeed
on operations. This provides earlier warning of threats,
allowing the Government to identify emerging events and
crises, intervene earlier in the conflict cycle if necessary,
and minimize the destructive effects of prolonged conflict.

Better situational awareness and intelligence will

make Canada, and Canadian Armed Forces personnel
deployed on operations, more secure, and will allow us
to tailor our contributions to global security in a way that
maximizes effectiveness. Strengthened collaboration with
other government departments and agencies working on
the frontlines of Canadian national security will also assist
in identifying risks and threats to Canadian interests.


In order to better **anticipate threats, challenges and**

opportunities, the Defence team will take a number of
concrete steps to:

 - prioritize investments in Joint Intelligence, Surveil­

lance and Reconnaissance capabilities;

 - enhance its intelligence collection, analysis and fusion

capabilities; and

 - support and leverage the expertise of Canada’s defence

and security academic community.

###### PRIORITIZING JOINT INTELLIGENCE,
 SURVEILLANCE, AND RECONNAISSANCE 

The Joint (or “all service”) Intelligence, Surveillance and
Reconnaissance concept seeks to bring the capabilities
of distinct military assets together in a way that provides
operational decision-makers with a clear, comprehensive
picture of the environment in which they are operating.

Joint Intelligence, Surveillance and Reconnaissance is

composed of interconnected intelligence collection plat­
forms – including aircraft, remotely piloted systems, land
vehicles, ships, submarines, people, and satellites – that
have the ability to capture data on points of intelligence
interest and exchange data in near real-time. Data is
relayed through space and ground-based technology to a
targeting or command centre to enable the fusion of data
for the ongoing development of the intelligence picture.
The Joint Intelligence, Surveillance and Reconnaissance
concept is often referred to as a ‘system-of-systems.’

From a defence perspective, a robust Joint Intelligence,

Surveillance and Reconnaissance capability is critically
important to the full range of operations the military may
be asked to undertake at home and abroad.

At home, Joint Intelligence, Surveillance and Recon­

naissance provides a clear picture of Canadian air and mari­
time approaches, which is critical to identifying potential
threats to Canadian security and sovereignty, including in
the Arctic. It helps us support other government depart­
ments in fulfilling their mandates, such as international
drug interdiction operations and disaster relief. Effective
Joint Intelligence, Surveillance and Reconnaissance is also
a vital element of Canada’s shared responsibility to help
defend North America.


In North America, Arctic surveillance poses particular

challenges. In addition to being a vast, sparsely populated
area, satellite coverage at extreme northern latitudes and
the nature of the polar ionosphere create unique issues for
sensor and communications capabilities. We need Joint
Intelligence, Surveillance and Reconnaissance solutions
that are specifically tailored to the Arctic environment.

Internationally, Joint Intelligence, Surveillance and

Reconnaissance provides critical support to all military
missions, from combat operations to humanitarian assis­
tance to peace operations. It can also provide early warning
of developing crises to enable the analytical planning and
strategy development required for conflict prevention.

Canadian security and defence preparedness benefits

tremendously from connectivity with our closest allies,
particularly the Five-Eyes network, which includes Canada,
the United States, the United Kingdom, Australia, and
New Zealand. This partnership, in which Five-Eyes partners
share much of the information collected by their respective
military assets, enhances Canada’s ability to understand
existing conflict zones and predict future ones, and allows
cost-saving and burden-sharing among partner nations.

Similarly, NATO considers Joint Intelligence, Surveil­

lance and Reconnaissance essential for operations and it is
a standing task for Allied military forces. Joint Intelligence,
Surveillance and Reconnaissance provides information and
intelligence to key decision-makers, helping them make
well-informed, timely and accurate decisions. Canada will
strongly support NATO efforts in this area as a way to
improve interoperability among Allies.


-----

In 2018, Canada will launch an expanded constellation

of RADARSAT satellites that can be used day and night
and in all weather. This enhanced capability will allow us
to track maritime traffic over much larger swathes of ocean
and provide for more timely identification of vessels that
may require further scrutiny.

The modernized CP-140 Aurora Long-Range Maritime

Patrol Aircraft is another vital Canadian Joint Intelligence,
Surveillance and Reconnaissance platform given its cuttingedge anti-submarine warfare and long-range surveillance
capabilities. This aircraft is used extensively by the Cana­
dian Armed Forces, both in the Arctic and abroad, and
will be replaced in the early 2030s with the Canadian
Multi-Mission Aircraft. In addition, an airborne Intelli­
gence, Surveillance and Reconnaissance platform will be
acquired for the Special Operations Forces.

Similarly, Canada’s Victoria-Class submarines, which

conduct sub-surface surveillance, will be a key element
of the system-of-systems approach to maritime domain
awareness. Working together with surface and air surveil­
lance capabilities, they will play an important role in
sovereignty operations and continental defence. The
Victoria-Class submarines will undergo incremental
modernization in the mid-2020s, which will ensure their
continued effectiveness out to the mid-2030s.

Given the critical role Joint Intelligence, Surveillance

and Reconnaissance plays in anticipating threats to Canada
and making informed operational decisions, we will prior­
itize further capability development in this area, both for
domestic and expeditionary purposes.


###### ENHANCING DEFENCE INTELLIGENCE

Intelligence is Canada’s first line of defence. The defence
of Canada, the ability to operate effectively overseas, and
the capacity to engage internationally are heavily depen­
dent on the systematic collection, coordination, fusion,
production, and dissemination of defence intelligence.

No ship goes to sea, no aircraft takes flight, and no boots

hit the ground anywhere in the world without the input of
specialists from the defence intelligence community. Given
the increasing complexity of the security environment,
reliable intelligence in expeditionary operations is crucial
to effective targeting that minimizes collateral damage and
civilian casualties.

Canadian intelligence capacities and expertise –

including those within the Canadian Armed Forces – can
also contribute to a deeper understanding of the origins
of conflict, the best ways to prevent it, and the locations
where capacity building will have the greatest impact. The
Canadian Forces Intelligence Command (CFINTCOM)
is the only entity within the Government of Canada that
employs the full spectrum of intelligence collection capa­
bilities while providing multi-source analysis. CFINTCOM
provides credible, timely and integrated defence intelligence
capabilities, products and services to support Canada’s
defence and national security objectives.

The Five-Eyes network of partners contributes greatly

to Canada’s understanding of the global security envi­
ronment. Similar arrangements with other allies, such
as NATO, are crucial to mission success. Canada will
continue to foster and strengthen intelligence sharing
relationships in a spirit of reciprocity. These relationships
are integral to ensuring that we are prepared for and can
anticipate challenges to domestic and global security.


###### NEW INITIATIVES

To enhance its Joint Intelligence, Surveillance and
Reconnaissance capabilities, the Defence team will:

67. Invest in Joint Intelligence, Surveillance and

Reconnaissance platforms, including next gen­
eration surveillance aircraft, remotely piloted
systems, and space-based surveillance assets
(see pages 38-40).

68. Integrate existing and future assets into a net­

worked, joint system-of-systems that will enable
the flow of information among multiple, intercon­
nected platforms and operational headquarters.

69. Prioritize Arctic Joint Intelligence, Surveillance

and Reconnaissance as a defence research and
development priority to produce innovative solu­
tions to surveillance challenges in the North.


-----

The Canadian Armed Forces will always ensure that the
collection, analysis and use of information is done in
accordance with the law, and recognizes the importance
of civilian review of national security and intelligence
activities, including through the new National Security
and Intelligence Committee of Parliamentarians.

The Defence team will increase its intelligence capacity,

and will examine its capabilities to understand and operate
in the information environment, in support of the conduct
of information and influence operations.


###### NEW INITIATIVES

In order to address the demand for defence intelli­
gence internally, across the Government of Canada,
and among our allies, the Defence team will:

70. Establish up to 120 new military intelligence po­

sitions, some of which will be filled by Reservists,
and add up to 180 new civilian intelligence per­
sonnel.

71. Build CFINTCOM’s capacity to provide more

advanced intelligence support to operations,
including through an enhanced ability to forecast
flashpoints and emerging threats, better support
next generation platforms, and understand rapid
developments in space, cyber, information and
other emerging domains.

72. Establish a Canadian Armed Forces targeting

capability to better leverage intelligence capabili­
ties to support military operations.


###### THE TARGETING PROCESS

Targeting is a formal, deliberate process used by
military commanders to determine courses of action
during operations. It governs military action by provid­
ing a framework for selecting and prioritizing targets
and determining the most effective way to deal with
them, whether through lethal or non-lethal means,
considering operational requirements and capabilities.
The targeting process seeks to minimize collateral
damage and civilian casualties, and is undertaken in
accordance with the Law of Armed Conflict.

Given the complexity of this process, close coordi­
nation is required between all involved and strong,
reliable intelligence is vital.

The targeting process enables operational decisionmaking, optimizes the use of military capabilities,
and ensures the use of the right military tool against
a specific target.

###### ADAPT

Canada’s military must be agile, flexible and responsive in
meeting the challenges and capturing the opportunities of
our rapidly evolving world.

###### A NEW VISION FOR THE RESERVE FORCE

The Reserve Force is an integral component of the Cana­
dian Armed Forces. Ninety-seven percent of Canadians live
within a 45 minute drive of a Reserve unit. Reservists come
from all walks of life including students, civil servants,
labourers, business people, academics and former members
of the Regular Force. These are, truly, citizen soldiers.

While the Reserve Force has a long history of making

important contributions to the Canadian Armed Forces
across the spectrum of operations, most recently during
the Afghan conflict, fundamental changes are necessary
for the Reserve Force to meet its full operational potential.

To this end, we will implement a new vision for the

Reserve Force that will:

 - enable Reserve Force units and formations to provide

full-time capability through part-time service;

###### NEW INITIATIVES

To enhance its relationship with and derive greater
benefit from Canada’s rich academic and analytic
community, the Defence team will:

73. Increase investment in academic outreach to

$4.5 million per year in a revamped and expanded
defence engagement program, including:

   - collaborative networks of experts;

   - a new scholarship program for Masters and

Post-Doctoral fellows; and

   - an expansion of the existing expert briefing

series and engagement grant program.


-----

 - ensure Reservists are a well integrated component of

the total force; and

 - appropriately train, prepare and equip Reservists in

sufficient numbers to be ready to contribute to opera­
tions at home and abroad.

Whether a task or duty is conducted by a Regular or

Reserve Force member, the result will be indistinguishable
operational excellence. Progress towards this goal is already
underway but must be broadened across the military to
ensure a truly integrated Canadian Armed Forces that
provides effective operational output.

The Canadian Armed Forces’ ability to meet Canada’s

defence needs, now and into the future, will rely upon
a Reserve Force that can generate **full-time capability**
**through part-time service.** To achieve this objective,


Reserve Force units and formations will be tasked to
perform specific full-time roles, some of which will be
provided exclusively by the Reserves. A number of these
roles will be new, such as cyber operators and Light Urban
Search and Rescue, while others will build on previous
success, such as information operations (including influ­
ence activities) and naval intelligence.

To maximize the operational output of the Canadian

Armed Forces, Reservists will be further integrated into
**the total force. This includes providing more opportuni­**
ties for Regular and Reserve Force members to train and
operate together in Her Majesty’s Canadian Ships, Battle
Groups, Wings and deployed Joint Task Forces, in Canada
and around the globe.

In recent decades, the Reserve Force has also been

an integral component of deployed operations and has
gained a wealth of experience conducting expeditionary
duties. As part of the new vision the Reserve Force will
**be tasked to deliver upon select deployed missions in a**
**primary role. This will include conducting missions that**
would benefit from their unique skills and strengths such
as capacity building efforts.

To ensure that the Reserve Force can continue to provide

Canadian citizen soldiers with flexible opportunities to
serve their country, the Reserve Force service model will
**be modernized, including alignment with job protection**
legislation. Military members must have the flexibility to
transition between the full- and part-time service as well
as the ability to pursue training and opportunities that
suit their career in the Canadian Armed Forces, whether
participating in deployed operations or serving on week­
ends and during the summer at the local Reserve Unit.
Rigorous, targeted training also contributes to enhanced
interoperability between the Regular and Reserve Force
and ensures an integrated, deployable total force.


###### FULL-TIME CAPABILITY THROUGH
 PART-TIME SERVICE

Reserve duties and schedules vary from person to
person. While some contribute a few days per month,
others are on full-time service. This flexibility allows
Canadians to serve their country according to their
personal circumstances. Full-time capability with a
part-time service will require Reserve Force units
and formations to bring together the contributions
of these various part-time Canadian Armed Forces
members to provide 24/7 defined readiness capability
according to the new and enhanced roles assigned to
them. This construct will allow Reservists to balance
a vibrant civilian life and occupation with meaningful,
part-time military service while enhancing the overall
Canadian Armed Forces effectiveness.


-----

In recognition of these new roles and responsibilities,

**Primary Reserve Force remuneration and benefits will**
**be better aligned with those of the Regular Force where**
the demands of service are similar. This will ensure Reserve
Force members receive fair compensation for their service
to Canada.

The Canadian Armed Forces is greatly enhanced by

being able to employ the varied backgrounds and skills of
Reservists. The prevalence of Reserve units across Canada,
including in major urban centres, makes them extremely
valuable as a means to tap into Canadian diversity,
capitalizing on different ways of thinking and problem
solving, and accessing the deep cultural knowledge resident
in Canadian communities. Reservists bring a wealth of
experience from their primary occupations that has allowed
the Canadian Armed Forces to access in-demand skills and
trades such as linguists and cyber professionals that would
otherwise take years to develop in the Regular Force.

To continue to benefit from all the strengths of

Canadian society and be successful in a highly competi­
tive labour market, the Reserve Force will dramatically
**improve the recruitment process** to ensure it is agile,
flexible and responsive in meeting the needs of those who
serve Canada through the Reserves. The Special Operations
Forces will also examine establishing a Reserve sub-unit in
a metropolitan area to access the valuable skills resident in
large population centres that are well-suited to enhance
the output of the military.


###### NEW INITIATIVES

To enhance the role and capabilities of the Reserve
Force, the Canadian Armed Forces will:

74. Increase the size of the Primary Reserve Force

to 30,000 (an increase of 1,500) and dramati­
cally reduce the initial recruitment process from
a number of months to a matter of weeks.

75. Assign Reserve Force units and formations new

roles that provide full-time capability to the
Canadian Armed Forces through part-time service,
including:

   - Light Urban Search and Rescue;

   - Chemical, Biological, Radiological and

Nuclear Defence;

   - Combat capabilities such as direct fire,

mortar and pioneer platoons;

   - Cyber Operators;

   - Intelligence Operators;

   - Naval Security Teams; and

   - Linguists.

76. Enhance existing roles assigned to Reserve

Force units and formations, including:

   - Information Operations (including Influence

Activities);

   - Combat Support and Combat Service

Support; and

   - Air Operations Support Technicians.

77. Employ the Reserve Force to deliver select expedi­

tionary missions in a primary role such as Cana­
dian Armed Forces capacity building.

78. Create an agile service model that supports

transition between full- and part-time service
and provides the flexibility to cater to differing
Reserve career paths.

79. Align Primary Reserve Force remuneration and

benefits with those of the Regular Force where
the demands of service are similar.

80. Revise annuitant employment regulations to

attract and retain more former Regular Force
personnel to the Reserves.

81. Offer full-time summer employment to Reservists

in their first four years with the Reserves com­
mencing in 2018.

82. Work with partners in the federal government

to align federal acts governing job protection
legislation. Subsequently, we will work with prov­
inces and territories to harmonize job protection
for Reserves at that level.

###### STRENGTHENING CANADIAN
 COMMUNITIES BY INVESTING IN YOUTH

National Defence has a long and proud history of sup­
porting youth through the Cadet and Junior Canadian
Rangers Programs. The Cadet and Junior Canadian
Rangers are the largest federally-sponsored youth
programs in Canada and provide young Canadians
aged 12 to 18 with an opportunity to participate in
a variety of fun, challenging and rewarding activities
while learning about the Canadian Armed Forces.

Cadets and Junior Canadian Rangers are encour­
aged to become active, responsible members of their
communities and make valuable contributions to Cana­
dian society through their environmental, citizenship
and community activities. They also learn valuable
life and work skills such as teamwork, leadership,
citizenship, and values and ethics. These programs
embrace Canada’s multiculturalism and diversity and
allow young Canadians opportunities to interact with
a wide range of other youth across Canada and the
world through international visits and exchanges.
Focused on Indigenous youth across Canada, the
Junior Canadian Rangers also incorporate the tradi­
tional knowledge and culture of their communities,
including skills related to hunting, fishing, local lan­
guages, as well as music, dance, cooking and spiri­
tual ceremonies.

Ultimately, the Cadet and Junior Canadian Rangers
Programs offer Canadian youth a physically challenging,
mentally stimulating, structured environment that
promotes community and environmental responsi­
bility as well as personal health and well-being. The
Cadet and Junior Canadian Rangers programs are an
important investment in our youth – many Cadets and
Junior Canadian Rangers are high achieving students
that go on to become Canada’s future leaders. That is
why National Defence is committed to expanding the
reach of these important programs so more Canadian
youth can experience these tremendous and positive
youth development opportunities and continue to
strengthen communities across Canada.


###### KEEPING PACE WITH TECHNOLOGICAL
 DEVELOPMENTS 

Technology is a critical enabler of modern militaries and
fundamental to every type of operation the Canadian
Armed Forces is expected to conduct. That includes every­
thing from search and rescue, humanitarian assistance,
disaster relief, and peace support, to combat. We must
keep pace with the rapid evolution of technology to
ensure continued operational relevance, both to address
threats from potential adversaries and to maintain our
ability to operate alongside key allies.

Three categories of capabilities have become particularly

critical to modern military operations – space, cyber and
remotely piloted systems. While each provides important
benefits on its own, they provide far more capability when
used jointly as a system-of-systems, and properly integrated
within the full suite of military capabilities.

###### SPACE CAPABILITIES

Space capabilities are critical to national security, sover­
eignty and defence. They have become an essential bulwark
for Canadian Armed Forces operations. In concert with
allies and partners, under the leadership of the Royal
Canadian Air Force, Canada has built a robust program
that contributes significantly to success in a wide range of
missions.


-----

###### THE RESPONSIBLE USE OF SPACE

Defence’s development and use of space capabilities
is carried out in accordance with domestic legisla­
tion, such as the _National Defence Act, the_ _Remote_
_Sensing Space Systems Act, and the Canadian Space_
_Agency Act, as well as relevant international law,_
including the Outer Space Treaty, the Limited Test Ban
Treaty, and the Law of Armed Conflict.

We actively support Global Affairs Canada’s participa­
tion in international diplomatic efforts to ensure that
space does not become an arena of conflict.


For example, the Canadian Armed Forces uses the

United States’ Global Positioning System for navigation,
to accurately select targets, and to help locate people in
distress. Satellite communications are essential for the
command and control of military operations, both in
remote regions in Canada, and around the world. Intelli­
gence, Surveillance and Reconnaissance satellites provide
incredibly detailed images of otherwise inaccessible areas,
including in the Arctic, in support of information and
situational awareness requirements. Indeed, Intelligence,
Surveillance and Reconnaissance satellites are vital to the
Canadian Armed Forces’ ability to monitor and control
Canada’s maritime approaches. Our space surveillance
satellite, Sapphire, looks out into space to track debris
and other threats to critical space assets. It contributes
to the United States’ Space Surveillance Network, which
benefits all Canadians by reducing the risk of collisions
that could take satellites offline.

As the importance of, and interest in, space has

increased, new challenges have arisen. For example, the


risk of collision between satellites and other orbiting
spacecraft or debris continues to increase as more objects
are launched into space. This adds to the other rigours
of operating in the space environment, such as harmful
radiation, or space weather.

Moreover, largely due to the critical role space plays in

enabling modern militaries, some states are developing a
range of anti-satellite weapons (ASATs) that could poten­
tially threaten our access to and use of space capabilities.
These counter-space capabilities range from those having
reversible effects, such as radio-frequency jammers, blind­
ing lasers, and cyber operations, to those having permanent
destructive effects such as earth-to-space missiles. Groundbased assets and infrastructure associated with satellites
are also vulnerable to a variety of threats from physical or
cyber attacks and jamming.

These threats do not necessarily mean that any state

currently has the intention to attack Canadian space
assets. However, it does mean that the Canadian Armed
Forces must take its counter-space capabilities into
account as it continues to develop the Canadian defence
space program.

Space-related challenges are magnified by the fact that

the international legal framework governing outer space
continues to evolve. For instance, how close is too close
when it comes to approaching military satellites? Should
testing or using debris-causing counter-space capabilities be
prohibited? Canada is providing leadership in promoting
the peaceful use of space and fostering norms of respon­
sible behaviour in space. The Defence team will continue
to support the efforts of Global Affairs Canada in this
important work.


-----

Broad cooperation between Canada and the Five-Eyes

community has been an enduring feature of Canada’s
space program. The Combined Space Operations Initia­
tive (CSpO) is the centre of our allied efforts to enable
and enhance cooperation. This initiative enables coopera­
tion on military and defence space activities, with the aim
of strengthening deterrence, improving the resilience of
space systems on which Five-Eyes militaries rely, and opti­
mizing resources across participating nations. Maintain­
ing interoperability in space with key partners and allies
is critically important to the success of our operations.


###### CYBER CAPABILITIES

Cyberspace is critical for the conduct of modern military
operations, and is recognized as a domain of operations,
like air, sea, land and space. The Canadian Armed Forces
and other advanced militaries rely on secure networks
to operate communications, intelligence and weapons
systems. Modern information technology brings signifi­
cant operational benefits, but also creates critical vulner­
abilities.

The cyber threat environment is evolving rapidly. Our

equipment platforms, from aircraft to armoured vehicles
to ships, are highly networked. So are our personnel in
the field. Potential adversaries see this as an opportu­
nity. Strategic adversaries, both state and non-state, are
constantly improving their ability to exploit our depen­
dence on networks with increasingly sophisticated tools.
And in cyberspace, significant effects can be achieved with
relatively little investment.

Defence can be affected by cyber threats at home and

abroad – from attempts to steal sensitive information
from our internal networks, to cyber attacks on the Cana­
dian Armed Forces on deployed operations, to the use of
cyberspace by terrorist organizations to spread disinfor­
mation, recruit fighters and finance their operations.
Indeed, there has been a steady increase in the number
of state and non-state actors developing the capability to
conduct disruptive cyber operations.

The Defence team works closely with the Commu­

nications Security Establishment, Public Safety Canada,
Global Affairs Canada and Shared Services Canada on
cyber issues. To date, this work has focused on strength­
ening the defence of important military systems, network
monitoring and control, building the future cyber force,
and integrating defensive cyber operations into broader
military operations.

However, a purely defensive cyber posture is no

longer sufficient. Accordingly, we will develop the capa­
bility to conduct active cyber operations focused on
external threats to Canada in the context of govern­
ment-authorized military missions. The employment of
this capability will be approved by the Government on
a mission-by-mission basis consistent with the employ­
ment of other military assets, and will be subject to
the same rigour as other military uses of force. Cyber
operations will be subject to all applicable domestic and
international law, and proven checks and balances such
as rules of engagement, targeting and collateral damage
assessments.


###### NEW INITIATIVES

To adapt to evolving challenges and opportunities
in the space domain, the Defence team will:

83. Defend and protect military space capabilities,

including by working closely with allies and
partners to ensure a coordinated approach to
assuring continuous access to the space domain
and space assets.

84. Work with partners to promote Canada’s national

interests on space issues, promote the peaceful
use of space and provide leadership in shaping
international norms for responsible behaviour in
space.

85. Invest in and employ a range of space capabilities,

including space situational awareness, spacebased earth observation and maritime domain
awareness, and satellite communications that
achieve global coverage, including in the Arctic.
(For more detail on Defence investments in space
capabilities, please see pages 38-39).

86. Conduct cutting-edge research and development

on new space technologies in close collaboration
with allies, industry, and academia to enhance the
resilience of space capabilities and support the
Canadian Armed Forces’ space capability require­
ments and missions.


-----

###### NEW INITIATIVES

To better leverage cyber capabilities in support
of military operations, the Defence team will:

87. Protect critical military networks and equipment

from cyber attack by establishing a new Cyber
Mission Assurance Program that will incorporate
cyber security requirements into the procurement
process.

88. Develop active cyber capabilities and employ

them against potential adversaries in support of
government-authorized military missions.

89. Grow and enhance the cyber force by creating

a new Canadian Armed Forces Cyber Operator
occupation to attract Canada’s best and brightest
talent and significantly increasing the number of
military personnel dedicated to cyber functions.

90. Use Reservists with specialized skill-sets to fill

elements of the Canadian Armed Forces cyber
force.


###### REMOTELY PILOTED SYSTEMS

Remotely Piloted Systems, popularly known as drones
– operating on land, in the air and under water – offer
great potential in helping Canada meet its defence needs,
at home and abroad. They are important tools that help
remove humans from dangerous situations, and permit
operations in severe and inhospitable environments.
Remotely piloted systems can be used effectively for a
wide range of military applications, from ground systems
used as bomb disposal robots to undersea systems for
conducting acoustic surveillance, mapping or the surveil­
lance of ‘choke-points’, to naval mine countermeasures.
Aerial systems can provide temporary communications
relay during a disaster relief mission when regular networks
have been damaged, enable long-range coastal and
Northern surveillance, and provide a targeting and preci­
sion strike capability.

As the development of remotely piloted systems

increases, this technology is proliferating among poten­
tial adversaries. Expanded proliferation, combined with
technological advancement, will mean that Canada is
faced with a variety of possible threats from remotely
piloted systems. These range from non-state actors using
unsophisticated and commercially available remotely
piloted aerial systems to conduct reconnaissance, to
advanced potential state adversaries developing high-end,
weaponized systems. In response, Canada will require the
appropriate capabilities to identify and defend against
these burgeoning threats.


As with any technology used in operations, the

Canadian Armed Forces will ensure that its use of remotely
piloted systems is consistent with domestic and international
law. Operations will be conducted in strict accordance
with all the controls, procedures and rules of engagement
that govern the use of force with any other weapon. We
also recognize that the rapid evolution of technology has
the potential to lead to increasing levels of autonomy in
remotely piloted systems. We will continue to support
Canada’s engagement and leadership in international policy
discussions on this issue in multilateral fora. The Canadian
Armed Forces is committed to maintaining appropriate
human involvement in the use of military capabilities that
can exert lethal force.


###### NEW INITIATIVES

To better leverage the unique benefits associated
with remotely piloted systems, the Defence team
will:

91. Invest in a range of remotely piloted systems,

including an armed aerial system capable of
conducting surveillance and precision strikes (For
more details on planned investments in remotely
piloted systems, please see pages 38-39).

92. Conduct research and development of remotely

piloted land, sea and aerial capabilities, in close
collaboration with industry and academia.

93. Promote the development of international norms

for the appropriate responsible and lawful use
of remotely piloted systems, in support of Global
Affairs Canada.

###### MODERNIZING THE BUSINESS OF DEFENCE

Whether meeting its environmental responsibilities, lever­
aging best management practices from the private sector
or striving to continually improve efficiency and effective­
ness, we will work tirelessly to modernize the business of
defence. A modern “business of defence” maximizes opera­
tional output and ensures that every defence dollar is put to
the best use in achieving our objectives. The Defence team
is committed to continuous improvement and is on track
to meet its goal to achieve $750 million in efficiencies and
enhanced productivity by 2019-20.

###### IMPROVING DEFENCE PROCUREMENT

Effective defence procurement is vital to ensuring the
Canadian Armed Forces is equipped and ready to fulfill
the important missions we ask of it. It is also essential for
ensuring public trust.

We must get it right.

While 90 percent of projects are delivered within

their planned scope and budget, defence procurement
has undoubtedly faced challenges. In particular, a small
segment of complex, high-value equipment projects
have faced significant challenges. Cumbersome decisionmaking and approval processes have introduced undue
delays. Accountability among departments has been
diffuse and at times unclear. Procurement professionals
would benefit from greater education, training and tools.
Capability requirements have not always been clearly
communicated to industry and Canadians. Early cost
estimates have sometimes proven problematic, creating
financial pressures and compromises to the final capability
delivered. And perhaps most challenging, 70 percent of all
projects have not been delivered on time.


Industry representatives should not have to deal

with burdensome and excessively complicated approval
processes that impact their ability to plan investments
and effectively and efficiently respond to the Government’s
requirements. It is also important for industry to have a
more transparent relationship with government in order
to deliver projects that meet shared expectations and
respect project timelines.

The Government of Canada recognizes the challenges

associated with military procurement and is working
closely with partners across government and industry to
examine every aspect of the procurement cycle in order to
find solutions.

Despite recent improvements, the timely delivery

of projects remains a significant issue and more must
be done. There are a number of steps that can be taken
immediately to help streamline defence procurement and
build on recent measures to improve procurement across
government. These measures will help keep us on track
with planned budget profiles and deliver new capabilities
when they are needed.


###### CANADIAN DEFENCE INDUSTRY

The Canadian defence industry is critical to the ability of the Canadian Armed Forces to deliver on the defence
mandate. Industry provides the military with broad defence capabilities including satellites, a range of aerospace
technologies, naval shipbuilding and various army vehicles. In addition to support services these contributions from
industry directly enable the military to succeed in everything they do. Close cooperation between the Canadian Armed
Forces and industry is also necessary to ensure that the Canadian Armed Forces has access to the advanced technologies
and innovation that allows Canada to keep pace with allies and an operational advantage over adversaries.

Cooperation with industry not only enhances the Canadian Armed Forces’ ability to deliver on its mandate with core
military capability, but provides Canadians with well-paying jobs, and firms with important export opportunities. The
defence sector employs over 60,000 Canadians and contributes over $10B annually to GDP. Defence industry employees’
average annual salaries are almost 60 percent above the average of other manufacturing sector employees and close
to 60 percent of defence sector sales are exports. This vital sector also helps keep Canada’s economy vibrant and
innovative with over 30 percent of defence occupations in innovation-relevant science and technology-related fields.


-----

###### NEW INITIATIVES

To streamline defence procurement, better meet
the needs of the military, and deliver projects in a
more timely manner, the Defence team will:

94. Reduce project development and approval time
in the Department of National Defence by at
least 50 percent for low-risk and low-complexity
projects through improved internal coordination,
increased delegation and strengthened approval
processes.

95. Work with partners to increase the Department
of National Defence’s contracting authorities for
goods up to $5 million by 2018, allowing over
80 percent of defence procurement contracts to
be managed by Defence.

96. Use procurement to incentivize Canadian research
and development in important and emerging technological areas.

97. Increase the transparency and timeliness of
communication to the defence industry associations, including instituting meetings between the
Department of National Defence and Canadian
industry through the Defence Industry Advisory
Group and other fora.

98. Grow and professionalize the defence procurement workforce in order to strengthen the capacity
to manage the acquisition and support of today’s
complex military capabilities. This includes the
addition of new procurement specialists and
enhanced training and professional accreditation
for defence procurement personnel.

99. Provide Canadians with regular updates on major
project and programs to increase transparency,
communicate challenges, and measure performance, including by publishing National Defence’s
Investment Plan.

100. Ensure that Canadian environmental standards
are adhered to in all procurement projects.


###### GREENING DEFENCE

A clean environment and sustainable economy are priorities for the Government of Canada� The Defence team
has a key role to play in helping advance these important
objectives as one of the largest employers and maintainers
of equipment and infrastructure� With the responsibility to
manage more than two million hectares of land, thousands
of buildings, jetties and training areas, the Defence team
must be at the centre of the Government’s commitment to
be a responsible steward of the environment�

We work hard every day to be good stewards of the
environment� Great progress has been made in remediating sites formerly contaminated by military activities and
work is ongoing to proactively mitigate the environmental
impacts of military activities going forward� The Defence
team is also doing its part to protect species at risk on base
lands, having signed a Memorandum of Understanding
with Environment and Climate Change Canada and Parks
Canada, and providing guidance to personnel on fulfilling
the requirements of the Species at Risk Act�

The Defence team has a plan to reduce greenhouse gas
emissions by 40 percent from the 2005 levels by 2030 in
support of the Federal Sustainable Development Strategy


###### THE DEFENCE TEAM’S COMMITMENT TO ADDRESS CLIMATE CHANGE

National Defence represents more than half of the
Government of Canada’s greenhouse gas emissions.
Consequently, it has a critical role to play in helping
the Government of Canada meet its climate objectives.

National Defence is committed to meet its Federal
Sustainable Development Strategy goal of reducing its
emissions by 40 percent from the 2005 levels by 2030
(excluding military fleets).


-----

goal of achieving a low-carbon government. This includes
seeking out opportunities to purchase clean power such
as in Alberta where, as of January 2017, 90 percent of
electricity supplying our installations is now coming from
renewable sources. We are also investing in Energy Perfor­
mance Contracts, which enable the department to make
use of private sector innovation and capital by allowing
energy service providers to identify and implement energy
efficiencies and get paid back through energy savings. The
range of measures available through Energy Performance
Contracts include lighting retrofits, modernized central
heating plants, building upgrades as well as improved
operating practices.

All of this important work is supported by improve­

ments to how the Defence team measures and reports on
its environmental performance. Effectively greening the
Defence team depends on having an accurate, quantifi­
able picture of our footprint. Military operations and
environmental protection and stewardship are not mutu­
ally exclusive – ensuring that the environmental impact
of defence activities is minimized is paramount to the
success of operations, whether at home or abroad.


###### MODERNIZING DEFENCE INFRASTRUCTURE

The Defence team manages the largest infrastructure
portfolio in the federal government, including over
20,000 buildings, 5,500 kilometers of roads and 3,000
kilometers of water works. This infrastructure portfolio
is worth roughly $26 billion and the maintenance, opera­
tion and infrastructure workforce accounts for about
10 percent of the defence budget in any given year. The
effective management of infrastructure is a critical enabler
for Canadian Armed Forces operations, whether it be the
bases and installations where the military train, prepare
for and execute their important missions, the vast support
network required to maintain and operate equipment, or
housing for military personnel and their families.

Great progress has been made in improving the opera­

tion of defence infrastructure by consolidating the port­
folio from nine individual operators to one. While this
model has only been in place since April 2016, having
a single point of responsibility and accountability has
already reduced administrative burdens, increased effi­
ciency, and enhanced responsiveness to operational needs.
However, further progress can still be made to improve
how we manage infrastructure, in order to better lever­
age innovative practices and maintain an affordable and
sustainable portfolio supported by the right workforce.

We will continue to modernize our infrastructure to

improve efficiency, reduce greenhouse gas emissions, and
support military personnel. Efforts will be focused on
properties that are operationally relevant and make effec­
tive use of space and land. The adoption of a centrallymanaged approach provides us with a greater understand­
ing and visibility of our infrastructure. We will therefore
be in a better position to consolidate assets with a similar
function and, as a result, accelerate the disposal of under­


###### NEW INITIATIVES

To ensure it supports the low-carbon govern­
ment targets outlined in the Federal Sustainable
Development Strategy, the Defence team will:

101. Reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 40 per­

cent from the 2005 levels by 2030, including
through the following measures:

   - Investing $225 million by 2020 in a wide

range of infrastructure projects across Can­
ada to reduce our carbon footprint;

   - Transitioning 20 percent of non-military ve­

hicle fleets to hybrid and electric by 2020;

   - Requiring new construction and major re­

capitalization projects to meet industry-rec­
ognized standards for high performing build­
ings such as the Silver Leadership in Energy
and Environmental Design (LEED) standard
or equivalent;

   - Expanding the use of Energy Performance

Contracts to implement energy efficiencies
on bases and wings across Canada; and

   - Installing electric charging stations at new

or retrofitted buildings for personnel to use
with defence fleets and/or personal vehicles.

102. Examine alternative energy options and their po­

tential use for operations.


-----

used buildings that do not meet our needs. This will help
us reduce operating costs and liabilities. All these efforts
will provide opportunities for First Nations and local
businesses to take part in construction contracts or demo­
lition projects.

In order to meet the future infrastructure needs of the

Canadian Armed Forces, we will explore opportunities
to harness private sector innovation and expertise. This
will include careful consideration of alternative delivery
models, such as public-private-partnerships, where there
is a strong business case and demonstrated value for
Canadians. This will provide valuable access to the skills,
capital, and best practices of the private sector, while
allowing the Defence team to focus on its core functions.
We will explore these opportunities on a case-by-case
basis, in consultation with employees, stakeholders, local
communities and public sector unions.


###### INNOVATION FOR DEFENCE EXCELLENCE AND SECURITY (IDEaS)

Innovative technology, knowledge, and problem solving
are critical for Canada and its allies to mitigate new threats,
stay ahead of potential adversaries, and meet evolving
defence and security needs, while generating economic
benefits for Canada.

In the past, defence innovation was often driven by

government research labs. In today’s knowledge economy,
technological development and innovation are more often
generated by the private sector and academia. Further, the
nature of conflicts and threats is rapidly evolving.

In this new environment, Canada’s military needs a

fundamentally new approach to innovation that allows it
to better tap into the extraordinary talent and ingenuity
resident across the country. The Innovation for Defence
Excellence and Security program, or IDEaS, will launch a
number of coordinated new initiatives that will transform
the way we generate solutions to complex problems.

IDEaS will establish research clusters to stimulate

collaboration and the free flow of ideas that are so critical
to innovation. These clusters will bring together academics,
industry and other partners to form collaborative innova­
tion networks. Areas for advanced research and develop­
ment include surveillance, cyber tools for defence, space,
alternative fuels, remotely piloted systems, data analytics,
and counter-improvised explosive device solutions. A
critical area for urgent research is the human dimension
of our work, including treatments for mental health and
operational stress injuries.

Competition is also an effective way to stimulate inno­

vation. The Innovation for Defence Excellence and Security


###### NEW INITIATIVES

To modernize the management of the real property
portfolio to better serve defence and free up
personnel to perform military tasks, the Defence
team will:

103. Dispose of underutilized or obsolete buildings. This

will improve the efficiency of the infrastructure
portfolio, while at the same time help us accelerate
the reduction of greenhouse gas emissions.

104. Improve infrastructure on bases and wings,

including housing for Canadian Armed Forces
personnel. In doing so, we will explore ways to
partner with the private sector and will consult
with public sector unions.


-----

program includes a new commitment to “compete the idea”
and turn to innovators in the private sector or academia to
seek viable solutions. This will allow innovators to approach
challenges creatively from their own unique perspectives.

IDEaS will introduce flexible new procurement tools

that allow Defence to commit early in the development
process to being the first customer for promising new
ideas. This will create an environment where risk is shared
more equally between Defence and its innovation partners.
The ability to develop and test solutions throughout their
development will allow Canadian industry to field test
their products with the Canadian Armed Forces to ensure
that new capabilities or approaches meet the needs of the
military and give Canadian companies the opportunity to
participate in global markets.

The Defence team will work more closely with Innova­

tion, Science and Economic Development Canada to align
closely with Canada’s broader Inclusive Innovation Agenda,
particularly as it relates to its objectives to grow companies
and accelerate growth, encourage an entrepreneurial and
creative society, leverage global scientific excellence, and
establish world-leading research clusters.


###### NEW INITIATIVES

To transform defence innovation in Canada, the
Defence team will:

105. Invest $1.6 billion over the next 20 years to

implement the new Innovation for Defence Excel­
lence and Security (IDEaS) program, including:

   - Creating clusters of defence innovators

(academics, industry, and other partners) to
conduct leading-edge research and devel­
opment in areas critical to future defence
needs;

   - Holding competitions that invite innovators

to present viable solutions to specific defence
and security challenges; and

  - Implementing flexible new procurement

mechanisms that allow Defence to develop
and test ideas and the ability to follow through
on the most promising ones with procurement.

###### ENHANCING ARCTIC CAPABILITY

Spanning three Territories and stretching as far as the
North Pole, Canada’s North is a sprawling region, encompassing 75 percent of the country’s national coastlines
and 40 percent of its total land mass� The sheer expanse
of Canada’s North, coupled with its ice-filled seas, harsh
climate, and more than 36,000 islands make for a challenging region to monitor – particularly as the North
encompasses a significant portion of the air and maritime
approaches to North America�


Although Canada’s North is sparsely populated, the
region is spotted with vibrant communities, many inhabited by Canada’s Indigenous populations� These communities form an integral part of Canada’s identity, and our
history is intimately connected with the imagery and the
character of the North� Economically, Northern Canada
is also home to considerable natural resources, industries,
and growing tourism – with the potential for further
exploration, including transit through Canada’s Arctic
Archipelago�

The Defence team’s extensive Northern footprint
includes more than 800 buildings at over 60 sites� Joint
Task Force North, headquartered in Yellowknife with
detachments in Whitehorse and Iqaluit, anchors the
Canadian Armed Forces’ Northern presence� The Canadian
Armed Forces, including through NORAD, operates from
a number of locations in the North, including in Inuvik,
Yellowknife, Rankin Inlet, Iqaluit, and Goose Bay, which
also help support the Northern deployment of fighter
aircraft� The Canadian Armed Forces also shares a number
of facilities with federal partners, including a state-of-theart cold weather training facility at Resolute Bay, a signals
intelligence facility at Canadian Forces Station Alert - the
northernmost permanently inhabited facility in the world

- and a high Arctic weather station at Eureka� In addition,
work is ongoing to complete the Nanisivik Naval Facility
which will support operations of the new Arctic Offshore
Patrol Ships, and other government maritime vessels�

Canada’s contributions to regional Arctic security
form a core part of the Canada-United States defence
relationship� Nowhere is this more apparent than in joint
efforts to renew the North Warning System (NWS) and
modernize elements of NORAD� As the security dynamics
in the Arctic evolve, Canada and the United States will
continue to work side by side to secure our shared northern
air and maritime approaches�

The Arctic is also becoming more relevant to the
international community� Climate change is increasingly
leading to a more accessible Arctic region� While operating in the region will remain a difficult challenge for the
foreseeable future, Arctic and non-Arctic states alike are
looking to benefit from the potential economic opportunities associated with new resource development and
transportation routes�

NATO has also increased its attention to Russia’s ability
to project force from its Arctic territory into the North
Atlantic, and its potential to challenge NATO’s collective
defence posture� Canada and its NATO Allies have been
clear that the Alliance will be ready to deter and defend
against any potential threats, including against sea lines


###### MODERNIZATION OF THE NORTH WARNING SYSTEM (NWS)

The NWS is a chain of unmanned radar stations within the Arctic that provides aerospace surveillance of
Canadian and United States Northern approaches.

While the current NWS is approaching the end of its life
expectancy from a technological and functional perspective, unfortunately the range of potential threats
to the continent, such as that posed by adversarial
cruise missiles and ballistic missiles, has become
more complex and increasingly difficult to detect.

To this end, Canada and the United States have already
launched bilateral collaboration to seek an innovative
technological solution to continental defence challenges including early warning. Studies are ongoing to
determine how best to replace this important capability
as part of the overall NORAD modernization.


-----

of communication and maritime approaches to Allied
territory in the North Atlantic�

The Canadian Armed Forces, through NORAD, has
a duty to monitor and control all of Canada’s territory
and approaches� In order to fully execute this mission
and provide effective aerospace warning and control for
all of North America, Canada will expand the Canadian
Air Defence Identification Zone (CADIZ) to cover the
entire Canadian Arctic archipelago� The current CADIZ
is based on the capabilities of the Distant Early Warning
(DEW) Line radars which were replaced in the late 1980s
by the North Warning System� Despite this change to
NORAD’s surveillance capability, the CADIZ boundary
remains unchanged� An expanded CADIZ will increase
awareness of the air traffic approaching and operating in
Canada’s sovereign airspace in the Arctic�

The Canadian Armed Forces will also introduce a
number of new Arctic-focused capabilities including
naval vessels such as the Arctic Offshore Patrol Ships,
space-based surveillance assets such as the RADARSAT
Constellation Mission, polar satellite communications,
Remotely Piloted Aerial Systems, operational support
sites including the Nanisivik Naval Facility, and a family
of new ground vehicles capable of navigating the harsh
landscape of Canada’s North� We will integrate these


capabilities into a ‘system-of-systems’ approach to Arctic
surveillance, comprising air, land, sea, and space assets
connected through modern technology�

While operating in Canada’s North, we often work in
close partnership with other federal, territorial, and local
partners� As such, we will leverage our new capabilities to
help build the capacity of whole-of-government partners
to help them deliver their mandates in Canada’s North,
and support broader Government of Canada priorities in
the Arctic region�

As Indigenous communities are at the heart of Canada’s North, we will also work to expand and deepen our
extensive relationships with these communities, particularly through the Canadian Rangers and Junior Canadian
Rangers� This will also include engaging local populations
as part of routine operations and exercises�


###### NEW INITIATIVES:

To enhance the Canadian Armed Forces’ ability
to operate in the Arctic and adapt to a changed
security environment, the Defence team will:

106. Enhance the mobility, reach and footprint of
the Canadian Armed Forces in Canada’s North
to support operations, exercises, and the Canadian Armed Forces’ ability to project force into
the region.

107. Align the Canadian Air Defence Identification
Zone (CADIZ) with our sovereign airspace.

108. Enhance and expand the training and effectiveness of the Canadian Rangers to improve their
functional capabilities within the Canadian
Armed Forces.

109. Collaborate with the United States on the development of new technologies to improve Arctic
surveillance and control, including the renewal
of the North Warning System.

110. Conduct joint exercises with Arctic allies and
partners and support the strengthening of situational awareness and information sharing in
the Arctic, including with NATO.


###### AIR DEFENCE IDENTIFICATION ZONES

Air Defence Identification Zones (ADIZ) are tools used
by states to monitor and identify aircraft approaching
their territory and assess possible threats to national
security. An ADIZ typically begins at the edge of sovereign airspace and extends outward into international
airspace.

The Canadian Air Defence Identification Zone (CADIZ)
is part of a larger ADIZ surrounding the continent, and
is used by NORAD to execute its primary mission of
aerospace control and warning for North America.

The establishment of an ADIZ provides notice to aircraft
that they may be intercepted if they do not notify Canadian authorities of their entry and exit through CADIZ.

###### ACT

Everything the Defence team does to better anticipate
threats, understand the complex security environment
and adapt to a rapidly changing world is done with a
single objective in mind: ensuring the Canadian Armed
Forces achieves success on operations. The Canadian
Armed Forces is fundamentally focused on delivering
results, whether it is battling through harsh conditions to
save someone in distress in the Canadian Arctic, working
with other Canadian government partners to help deliver
life-saving assistance after a natural disaster at home or
abroad, or engaging in combat to defeat potential adver­
saries or protect vulnerable populations from those seeking
to harm them, in the context of United Nations or other
peace operations.

Given the uncertainty and complexity of the global

security environment, Canada will continue to invest in
a multi-purpose, combat-ready force that is able to act
decisively and deliver results across the full spectrum
of operations. The roles and missions of the Canadian
Armed Forces have traditionally been characterized in
geographic terms, with distinct lines drawn between
domestic, continental and international responsibilities.
The Canadian Armed Forces’ commitment to defending


###### CONCURRENT OPERATIONS

At any given time, the Government of Canada can
call upon the Canadian Armed Forces to undertake
missions for the protection of Canada and Canadians
and the maintenance of international peace and
stability. It will often call upon the Canadian Armed
Forces to deploy on multiple operations at the same
time. This policy ensures the Canadian Armed Forces
will be prepared to simultaneously:

 - defend Canada, including responding concurrent­

ly to multiple domestic emergencies in support of
civilian authorities;

 - meet its NORAD obligations, with new capacity

in some areas;

 - meet commitments to NATO Allies under Article 5

of the North Atlantic Treaty; and

 - contribute to international peace and stability

through:

o two sustained deployments of

~500-1500 personnel in two different
theatres of operation, including one as
a lead nation;

o one time-limited deployment of

~500-1500 personnel (6-9 months duration);

o two sustained deployments of

~100-500 personnel;

o two time-limited deployments (6-9 months)

of ~100-500 personnel;

o one Disaster Assistance Response

Team (DART) deployment, with scaleable
additional support; and

o one Non-Combatant Evacuation Operation,

with scaleable additional support.


Canada and the broader North American continent and
contributing to international peace and security will be
stronger than ever. However, making sharp distinctions
among the missions that fulfill these roles is becoming
less and less relevant in the new security environment.
The rise of borderless challenges such as terrorism and
cyber attacks, the increasingly strong connection between
global stability and domestic security and prosperity, and
the fact that the Canadian Armed Forces is as likely to
support broader whole-of-government efforts abroad as it
is at home, mean that its three traditional roles are becom­
ing more and more intertwined.

###### CANADIAN ARMED FORCES CORE MISSIONS

The eight new core missions of the Canadian Armed
Forces must reflect this reality. Instead of being simply
divided geographically, they are now also plotted against
the spectrum of military options. These missions are all
critical to delivering on Canada’s defence objectives, and
are not listed in order of priority.

At one end of the spectrum are traditional defence

tasks. This includes working with allies and partners to
prevent potential adversaries from causing harm and to
deter hostile actions against Canada and its allies. It also
involves being prepared to engage in combat if prevention
and deterrence fail.

At the other end of the spectrum are activities that we

undertake in support of other government departments
to respond to emergencies in which immediate or prompt
action is required to save lives and reduce human suffering.

And between these two poles on the spectrum are a

wide range of operations, including peace support, as well
as those in support of other government departments –
from responding to terrorist threats in Canada or supporting
fisheries enforcement off our shores, to capacity building,
to evacuating Canadians to remove them from danger far
from home.


-----

###### Detect, deter and defend against threats to
 or attacks on Canada

Defending Canada and Canadians is the Canadian Armed
Forces’ top priority. Above all else, the Canadian Armed
Forces must ensure the defence and security of Canada.
This begins with the surveillance and control of Canadian
territory and approaches, with an increasing focus on the
Arctic. The Canadian Armed Forces will provide constant
monitoring of Canada’s approaches and have high readi­
ness assets available at all times to respond in the event
potential threats are detected.

The Canadian Armed Forces will develop and main­

tain a robust capacity to respond concurrently to multiple
domestic emergencies.

###### Detect, deter and defend against threats to or attacks on North America in partnership with the United States, including through NORAD

The Canadian Armed Forces will continue to work within
NORAD to conduct continental operations to defend
against shared continental threats and address common
challenges. Canada will ensure it has the military capabili­
ties required to meet its NORAD obligations, including
sufficient mission-ready fighter aircraft, and enhance our
capacity to provide continuous aerospace and maritime
domain awareness and aerospace control.

Additionally, the Tri-Command Framework brings

together NORAD and our two national commands –
the Canadian Joint Operations Command (CJOC) and
United States Northern Command – to strengthen North


American defence and security. Beyond that, Canadian
and American services are well-integrated and interop­
erable, both from a materiel and doctrinal perspective.
As Arctic states, Canada and the United States have a
shared interest in ensuring the Arctic remains safe and
stable. Canada will cooperate with the United States on
Arctic security and will examine the requirements to meet
all-perils threats to the continent through NORAD
modernization. This will also involve working collabora­
tively to enhance shared situational awareness and early
warning in the northern environment.

###### Lead and/or contribute forces to NATO and coalition efforts to deter and defeat adversaries, including terrorists, to support global stability

Combating threats to global stability reinforces security
and prosperity at home. The Canadian Armed Forces will
be prepared to operate with its close allies and partners to
defeat armed adversaries and respond to instability, around
the world and in international waters. The Canadian
Armed Forces will work with allies to identify, confront
and defeat trans-regional threats, including from violent
extremist organizations.

As a founding member of NATO, Canada has endur­

ing obligations to support and defend Allies who are
threatened by any potential adversary and to contribute
to continued security, while preserving stability in the
Euro-Atlantic region. The Canadian Armed Forces will
contribute actively to collective defence. In 2016, Canada
embarked on a leadership role in the name of deterrence,
acting as framework nation as part of NATO’s enhanced
Forward Presence in Central and Eastern Europe.


-----

###### Lead and/or contribute to international peace
 operations and stabilization missions with the United Nations, NATO and other multilateral partners

Canada has made a firm commitment to increase its
support to United Nations peace operations. Canada will
focus on four core elements, undertaken as a whole-ofgovernment effort, by:

 - providing Canadian personnel and training for United

Nations peace operations;

 - strengthening Canadian support for conflict preven­

tion, mediation, and peace building efforts;

 - advancing the role of women and youth in the promo­

tion of peace and security; and

 - supporting United Nations reform efforts to make

peace operations more effective.


Peace support efforts by the Canadian Armed Forces

will be complementary to broader government objectives
and whole-of-government efforts to prevent conflict, stabi­
lize fragile situations and combat threats. The Canadian
Armed Forces will collaborate closely with other relevant
departments and agencies on a more integrated approach
to operational-level planning of peace support and stabi­
lization missions. The Canadian Armed Forces will be
prepared to make tangible, value-added contributions to
United Nations peace operations in all four core elements.
This could include the deployment of leadership and
ground troops, as well as the provision of critical enabling
capabilities. To improve the performance and profes­
sional standards of United Nations peace operations, the
Canadian Armed Forces will enhance the ability of others
to contribute to peace operations through training and
capacity building efforts and will contribute to key posi­
tions both at United Nations Headquarters and within
peace operations to help effect change. Canada will also
continue supporting the prevention of child soldiers.

The Canadian Armed Forces will develop stronger rela­

tionships with other multilateral partners, such as the Euro­
pean Union, regional actors, such as the African Union, and
like-minded states, like those of the Francophonie, to further
enhance global capacity to promote peace and stability.

For Canada, addressing challenges to international

stability through United Nations-led or United Nationssanctioned structures presents a number of advantages:
It facilitates burden-sharing; diffuses risk; reinforces the
rules-based international order; and allows Canada and
other countries to contribute based on their particular
strengths and capabilities for collective benefit.


###### CHILD SOLDIERS

The employment of Child Soldiers is a heart-breaking
but persistent feature of modern conflict around the
world. Although their use is considered a war crime, it
is not a new trend.

Canada supports the prevention of child soldiers. This
approach is necessarily multi-faceted and requires close
coordination across government, as well as working with
organizations such as the Roméo Dallaire Child Soldiers
Initiative to respond to the unique implications of dealing
with Child Soldiers.

In addressing this serious issue, the Canadian Armed
Forces will be guided by six principles:

 - Understanding the context for conducting military

operations within Human Rights and International


Humanitarian Law, and determining and applying
appropriate Rules of Engagement;

- The legal requirement for reporting the six grave

violations (UNSCR 1261 (1999)) in respect of Child
Soldiers;

- Determining the logistical implications and consid­

erations of handling and treatment of Child Soldiers

- Ensuring proper physical and psychological prepa­

ration of Canadian Armed Forces personnel for
operations that may involve dealing with Child
Soldiers;

- Having an appropriate gender mix within the de­

ployed force to facilitate the response to encoun­
tering Child Soldiers; and

- Ensuring the provision of early and accurate public

information about all encounters with Child Soldiers.


-----

###### WOMEN, PEACE AND SECURITY

The United Nations Security Council adopted its first
resolution on women, peace and security in October
2000. United Nations Security Council Resolution
(UNSCR) 1325 and the seven subsequent resolutions
seek to address the disproportionate and unique
impact of armed conflict on women and the key role
they can play in conflict management, conflict reso­
lution, and sustainable peace. The women, peace,
and security framework rests on four pillars, namely:
prevention of conflict and of violence against women,
active and meaningful participation of women in peace
and security activities, protection of women’s and
girls’ human rights including against sexual violence,
and women’s involvement in, and access to, relief and
recovery efforts. Women’s participation is vital to
achieving and sustaining peace, and has a tangible
impact on the operational effectiveness of our forces.
Women broaden the range of skills and capacities
among all categories of personnel, improve the deliv­
ery of peace and security tasks, enhance situational
awareness and early warning by facilitating outreach
to women in communities, and improve a military
force’s accessibility, credibility and effectiveness in
working among local populations. Lastly, when women
are included, peace processes are more likely to be
successful and peace agreements are more likely to
endure.

Among our allies, the Canadian Armed Forces is
regarded as a leader of military gender integration. The
last occupation to be closed to women, that of subma­
riner, was opened to both sexes in 2001 and women
participate fully and meaningfully in all aspects of


domestic and international missions. The Canadian
Armed Forces has developed and implemented policies
of equal opportunity and is making considerable effort
to attract greater numbers of qualified women, and
to identify and address potential barriers to members
of Defence. Although challenges remain in this regard,
the Canadian Armed Forces is undertaking ongoing
efforts to address them. As an example, the Canadian
Armed Forces Diversity Strategy applies to all military
members and key institutional processes including
programs, policies, directives, procedures and doc­
trines that direct and influence the Canadian Armed
Forces and its operations.

The Canadian Armed Forces will continue to integrate
gender perspectives into the analysis, planning, execu­
tion and evaluation of all operations. These efforts are
built upon UNSCR 1325 and its subsequent Resolutions.
Incorporating gender perspectives into the preparation,
conduct, and evaluation of missions enables the Cana­
dian Armed Forces to increase operational effectiveness
and enhance understanding of the challenges faced by
populations at risk in areas of armed conflict or natural
disaster. Military members receive continuing educa­
tion and training to raise awareness of the differential
impact of conflict, natural disasters and humanitarian
emergencies on women, men, girls and boys. The Ca­
nadian Armed Forces also promotes the role of women
in international peace and security within organiza­
tions such as NATO. Military members are taught from
basic training onwards to adhere to the highest stan­
dards of ethical conduct in keeping with Canadian and
international human rights.


-----

###### Engage in capacity building to support the security of other nations and their ability to contribute to security abroad

Canada has a long history of providing expertise to help
partner nations strengthen the professional capacity of
their defence and security forces. The Canadian Armed
Forces will leverage its world-class ability to train and assist
foreign military forces and security partners to continue
this tradition both in the field and here in Canada – at
institutions such as the Peace Support Training Centre
in Kingston, Ontario. Bolstering the capacity of others
not only contributes to international stability, but also
provides Canada with a valuable opportunity to exhibit
leadership abroad and promote key Canadian values such
as inclusion, accountable governance, gender equality and
respect for diversity and human rights.

The scope of capacity building is determined on a

mission-by-mission basis and can include training, advice,
and assistance for partner forces including lethal and nonlethal aid. The Canadian Armed Forces will work with
Global Affairs Canada to ensure capacity building efforts
are always focused on trusted bilateral partners that have
demonstrated a clear commitment to human rights and
regional and global stability.

###### Provide assistance to civil authorities and
 law enforcement, including counter-terrorism,
 in support of national security and the security
 of Canadians abroad

The Canadian Armed Forces will be prepared to respond
to requests from the government and to assist other
government departments and law enforcement agencies
in support of Canada’s national security and the security
of Canadians abroad. In Canada, this could include a
range of operations, including responding to terrorist
threats, providing security support to a major event, or
responding to a Chemical, Biological, Radiological,
Nuclear, and Explosive (CBRN-E) incident. The Cana­
dian Armed Forces may also conduct such operations in
an international context, such as engaging in counternarcotics operations, counter-terrorism operations, and
undertaking non-combatant evacuations. Fulfilling this
core mission will be facilitated by an increase in the size
and capabilities of Canadian Special Operations Forces.


###### Provide assistance to civil authorities and
 non-governmental partners in responding to
 international and domestic disasters or
 major emergencies

As natural disasters and weather-related emergencies
grow in frequency and severity, they will bring with
them an increasing need for Canadian Armed Forces
support. At home, the Canadian Armed Forces stands
ready to respond to requests from civil authorities in cases
where their capacity to respond has been overwhelmed.
Similarly, humanitarian assistance and disaster relief
abroad remain a priority for the Government of Canada
and the Canadian Armed Forces is ready to assist as
required, supporting other government departments,
international aid organizations, and local governments
during international emergency response. The Canadian
Armed Forces Disaster Assistance Response Team will be
critical to this effort.

In addition to responding to natural disasters, the

Canadian Armed Forces may be called upon to provide
military support to civilian organizations in the wake of
a major disruption to or attack on critical infrastructure,
including a catastrophic cyber attack on vital networks.


-----

###### THE DISASTER ASSISTANCE RESPONSE TEAM (DART)

The DART is a diverse, multidisciplinary military orga­
nization designed to deploy on short notice anywhere
in the world in response to situations ranging from
natural disasters to complex humanitarian emergen­
cies. The DART is one component of the Government
of Canada’s toolkit for response to such crises abroad
and deploys on advice from Global Affairs Canada in
partnership with the Defence team.

The DART is equipped to conduct emergency relief
operations for a limited period until national and
international aid agencies are in a position to provide
long-term help. The DART does not compete with
these organizations; it complements their activities.
The DART is not designed to provide first response
services, such as search and rescue or emergency
trauma care, but rather critical needs including:
water purification, primary medical care and engi­
neering help. DART personnel who belong to Canadian
Armed Forces units across Canada, train together
regularly and keep themselves ready to mobilize
quickly. The DART also includes civilian advisors
who provide critical civil-military liaison, policy and
humanitarian advice.

The scalability and multidisciplinary nature of
the DART is one of its greatest assets and will be
maintained.


###### Conduct search and rescue (SAR) operations

The Canadian Armed Forces will conduct aeronautical
search and rescue in support of people in distress within its
area of responsibility, as well as help coordinate maritime
search and rescue alongside the Canadian Coast Guard.
Search and rescue is a shared responsibility across all levels
of government and is delivered with the support of the
private sector and thousands of volunteers – the Canadian
Armed Forces plays a vital role within this broader team.

Additionally, the ongoing multi-year launch and

operation of the Medium Earth Orbit Search and Rescue
(MEOSAR) satellite capability, of which Canada is one of
four key contributors, will greatly enhance the ability of
the Canadian Armed Forces to locate people in distress.
Defence will complete the acquisition of the new FixedWing Search and Rescue Aircraft and also invest in its
rotary wing Search and Rescue helicopters to ensure the
reliability that Canadians depend upon in times of need.


###### SEARCH AND RESCUE BY THE NUMBERS

Canada has one of the world’s largest areas of respon­
sibility for search and rescue, covering 18 million square
kilometres of land and water, more than 243,800 kilo­
metres of coastline, three oceans, three million lakes,
as well as the St. Lawrence River system.

Alongside the Canadian Coast Guard, the Canadian
Armed Forces responds to more than 9,000 search
and rescue calls annually, approximately 1,000 of
which result in the launching of search and rescue
air assets. Leveraging a multi-national search and
rescue satellite constellation of which Canada is a
founding member and one of four key contributors,
successful search and rescue operations rely on highly
skilled personnel trained to operate specialized equip­
ment from locations strategically positioned around
the country.

The Canadian Armed Forces devote approximately
950 personnel to deliver search and rescue services
24 hours a day, 365 days a year.

# 7 GLOBAL DEFENCE
 ENGAGEMENT

Addressing common security challenges requires the
Canadian Armed Forces to operate regularly alongside
and be interoperable with allied and partner militaries.
Canada rarely operates alone, rather as a part of alliances
and coalitions, typically as part of NORAD or under a
United Nations and/or NATO mandate. Strong partner­
ships with allies, partners and regional and international
organizations are critical to the effective execution of the
defence mandate. Canada is committed to being a respon­
sible international player that upholds universal values,
contributes to peace building, and works together with
partners to help enhance overall capacity and resiliency.

Cooperative defence relationships also support the


advancement and promotion of broader government
priorities – particularly national security, trade, interna­
tional assistance, and foreign policy objectives. Defence
contributes to this broader diplomatic activity in close
cooperation with whole-of-government partners, including
Global Affairs Canada, Public Safety and the organiza­
tions under its umbrella. The Defence team must be able
to work together abroad with its whole-of-government
partners, bringing all of the strengths of the Government
of Canada to bear in a coordinated and coherent manner
to address global issues. This may include working
together with non-governmental organizations and civil
authorities who regularly cooperate with the Government
of Canada in the pursuit of common objectives.

Recognizing that Canada’s strategic interests are

engaged in different ways in various regions of the world,
Defence will employ a tailored approach to global part­
nerships. This includes maintaining a network of defence
partnerships that is flexible and adaptable.

Beyond deepening its engagement with long-standing,

like-minded allies, Defence will also pursue stronger
relationships with other key countries, including those
facing instability and those whose policies and perspec­
tives are not aligned with Canada’s. Active engagement
with other armed forces and defence ministries provides
opportunities to build mutual understanding, enhance
transparency, resolve differences, demonstrate leadership
and promote Canadian values.


###### DEFENCE DIPLOMACY

Deep and meaningful relationships with international
partners allow the Defence team to:

 - build greater situational awareness through

intelligence cooperation;

 - enhance interoperability and operational effec­

tiveness;

 - extend mobility and reach through logistics and

diplomatic arrangements;

 - reinforce the capacity of partners;

 - promote defence materiel cooperation and

export opportunities for Canadian industry; and

 - exchange lessons learned and best practices.

Most importantly, partnerships signal Canada’s com­
mitment to work together with allies, partners, and the
broader international community to address common
security challenges and contribute meaningfully to
global security and stability.


-----

###### CANADA’S GLOBAL DEFENCE
 PARTNERSHIPS

Canada is engaged worldwide. Our commitment to
NORAD, NATO, and Five-Eyes is unwavering. Canada
and the United States share an unparalleled defence rela­
tionship forged by shared geography, common values
and interests, deep historical connections and our highly
integrated economies. This relationship is critical to every
aspect of Canada’s defence interests and economic prosper­
ity. NORAD was established in 1958 to deter and defend
against aerospace threats to North America. Since then, the
threats facing North America have evolved significantly
in the air and maritime environment, as well as other
emerging domains, and weapons technology, including
ballistic and cruise missiles, has advanced tremendously.
Canada’s policy with respect to participation in ballistic
missile defence has not changed. However, we intend
to engage the United States to look broadly at emerging
threats and perils to North America, across all domains, as
part of NORAD modernization. As NORAD approaches
its 60[th] anniversary in 2018, Canada will work with
the United States to modernize the Command to meet
these and other challenges to continental defence. This
is a prudent, holistic approach that takes into account all
perils. Canada and the United States will jointly examine
options to renew the North Warning System and
modernize the Command, which is integral to fulfilling
the NORAD mandate of aerospace warning and control,
as well as maritime warning.


Beyond the continent, Canada will continue to collab­

orate internationally with the United States, consistent with
Canadian interests and values, engaging in complementary
activities that contribute to stability abroad, which in turn
helps maintain security at home.

Canada remains committed to exercising the full

extent of its sovereignty in Canada’s North, and will
continue to carefully monitor military activities in the
region and conduct defence operations and exercises as
required. Canada’s renewed focus on the surveillance and
control of the Canadian Arctic will be complemented by
close collaboration with select Arctic partners, including
the United States, Norway and Denmark, to increase
surveillance and monitoring of the broader Arctic region.

While the Arctic eight (Canada, the United States,

Denmark, Iceland, Norway, Sweden, Finland, and Russia)
rightfully remain the primary actors in the Arctic, Canada
recognizes the increasing interest of non-Arctic states and
organizations and will work cooperatively with all willing
partners to advance shared interests on safety and security.

NATO is the foundation of Canada’s defence relations

in Europe. Canada also enjoys a number of deep bilateral
relationships with specific countries in the region based
on shared interests and values. Foremost among these
relationships is that which Canada shares with the United
**Kingdom, with whom Canada already enjoys deep**
and vibrant defence ties rooted in history, founded on
shared values, and anchored by close cooperation across
the defence enterprise. Similarly, Canada shares a strong
historical and linguistic connection with France. Canada
will nurture these relationships while seeking opportunities
to further develop them.

Canada is also a Pacific nation. Given the increasing

importance of the Asia-Pacific to Canadian security and
prosperity, Canada is committed to being a reliable player
in the region, through consistent engagement and strong


###### NEW INITIATIVE

To ensure the continued security of North America,
the Defence team will:

111. Modernize NORAD to meet existing challenges

and evolving threats to North America, taking
into account the full range of threats.


-----

###### MULTILATERALISM IN ACTION

 United Nations

Canada is fully committed to renewing its engagement
with the United Nations and increasing its contribution
to United Nations peace operations. The United Nations
has a critical role to play in shaping the rules-based
international order and makes important contributions
to global stability, conflict prevention and the protection
of civilians. Doing our part to contribute to United Nations’
efforts to promote and sustain global peace and secu­
rity directly serves Canadian interests. A more peaceful
world is a safer and more prosperous world for Canada,
too. National Defence will make important contributions of Canadian personnel and training for United Nations peace
operations, increasing the number of personnel in United Nations Headquarters, and enhancing training and capacity
building efforts. The United Nations has recognized the changing nature and complexity of peace operations, and
Canada welcomes the United Nations’ ongoing efforts to ensure that it, and member states, are able to adapt
effectively. Canada recognizes that United Nations leadership of peace operations offers a number of important
advantages: it endows interventions with legitimacy, facilitates burden-sharing, diffuses risk, and allows Canada and
other countries to make contributions based on their particular strengths and capabilities.

###### North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO)

Canada was a founding member of NATO in 1949 and the Alliance has been a central pillar of Euro-Atlantic defence and
a cornerstone of Canadian defence and security policy ever since. NATO provides significant benefits to Canada’s
security and its global interests. NATO membership also carries important obligations. Article 5 of the Washington
Treaty guarantees that an armed attack against one or more Allies is considered an attack against all, which requires
Canada to be prepared to respond. Membership in the Alliance – under Article 3 of the Treaty – also calls upon Allies
to maintain their individual and collective capabilities to defend themselves and to resist attack. Article 3 underpins
NATO’s ability to respond to an attack. Canada has developed capabilities that are designed to defend our vast
territory, including maritime forces, fighter aircraft, intelligence, surveillance and reconnaissance capabilities, air
mobility, and air-to-air refueling. These capabilities are also critical to the Alliance.

While the crisis management activities of NATO have garnered much attention in recent years, collective defence
and cooperative security remain core tasks of the Alliance, as does deterrence, which is becoming increasingly
important in today’s security environment. Defence will continue to demonstrate Canada’s steadfast commitment
to NATO by maintaining high-quality, interoperable, and expeditionary forces which Canada can deploy, as needed,
to effectively contribute to NATO deterrence posture, operations, exercises and capacity building activities. Canada
supports NATO efforts to ensure it is prepared to respond to a rapidly evolving security environment. Canada’s con­
tribution as a framework nation to NATO’s enhanced Forward Presence in Central and Eastern Europe is a testament
to this commitment. Arms control, disarmament and non-proliferation efforts also contribute directly to the achieve­
ment of the Alliance’s core objectives, contributing to more secure, stable and predictable international relations.

###### Five Eyes Network

Building on our shared values and long history of operational cooperation, the Five-Eyes network of partners,
including Canada, the United States, United Kingdom, Australia and New Zealand, is central to protecting Canada’s
interests and contributes directly to operational success. This partnership, which originated in intelligence sharing,
continues to greatly enhance our ability to understand and react to the global security environment, and enhances
our interoperability with allies. The Five-Eyes community is an increasingly important forum for consultation and
coordination on a wider range of key policy and operational matters, including the military use of space and
collaboration on research and development. National Defence will continue to deepen its relationship with Five-Eyes
partners, particularly as it relates to further expanding cooperation on space and innovation.


-----

partnerships. We will establish meaningful strategic
dialogues with key regional powers to exchange views on
regional security issues and threats to regional stability,
such as territorial disputes and the situation in the Korean
Peninsula. This will include a continued presence in
the region through high-level visits and participation in
regional exercises. We will work closely with long-standing
partners, Australia, New Zealand, and the United States
on Asia-Pacific security issues. We will seek to develop
stronger relationships with other countries in the region,
particularly **China. We will also increase our engage­**
ment with the Association of Southeast Asian Nations
**(ASEAN). As Canada pursues membership in the East**
Asia Summit, the Department of National Defence will
in parallel seek membership in the ASEAN Defence
Ministers Meeting – Plus. Membership in this important
forum will help Canada understand and play a more active
role in the region’s security architecture. This will enhance
our ability to contribute to stability and security in the
Asia-Pacific. Additionally, we will continue to cooperate
with our allies and partners in the region by enhancing
our participation in the ASEAN Regional Forum (ARF).

In **Africa, the Defence team will work within an**

integrated whole-of-government approach to advance
Canada’s objectives, notably by contributing to peace and
security through re-engaging in United Nations peace
operations, providing training, supporting development
and empowering women and girls. Our approach to
Africa will seek to make tangible contributions to the
stability necessary to advance Sustainable Development
Goals and create the conditions for peace. To be successful,
Defence will need to build new bilateral relationships


in Africa, particularly with the African Union, given its
leadership role in peacekeeping efforts in the region. Such
relationships are an important avenue to address conflict
prevention and help to stem the expansion of instability.

In the Middle East, Canada’s primary strategic inter­

ests will be to continue to contribute to regional peace
and stability, along with countering the proliferation of
weapons of mass destruction and reducing the threat of
terrorism. This requires strong relationships to ensure
re-supply, material transhipment, aircraft over-flight and
other diplomatic clearances for equipment and personnel
in support of operations. The Defence team will continue
to work with partners in the region to ensure stability,
including through combined maritime operations, as well
as to facilitate operational requirements through Defence
Cooperation Arrangements and other diplomatic and
logistics agreements of mutual interest. A strong focus
on capacity building and participation in a wide range of
operations will continue.

In the **Americas, Canada will continue to work**

collaboratively with partners throughout the hemisphere
to develop regional capabilities, encourage operational
flexibility and foster military professionalization. Regu­
lar cooperation and engagement is critical to meeting the
security and defence challenges of the region. Canada has
an opportunity to demonstrate leadership in areas such
as capacity building, gender mainstreaming – the routine
consideration of gender in public policy development –
as well as humanitarian assistance and disaster response.
Canada will also continue to leverage its strong bilateral
defence relationships in support of multilateral organiza­
tions such as the Conference of the Defence Ministers of
the Americas and the Inter-American Defence Board, and
maintain support for other government departments to
counter the illegal movement of drugs, people, weapons,
money and other transnational organized crime activity.

###### DEFENCE DIPLOMACY

A military cannot be engaged in the world unless it
is present in the world, and this includes building and
sustaining strong relationships with allies, partners, other
militaries and multilateral institutions. These cooperative
relationships enhance knowledge, understanding and
interoperability, allow for the exchange of best practices,
and ultimately contribute significantly to success on oper­
ations. This kind of continuous global military engage­
ment is often referred to as defence diplomacy.

The Canadian Armed Forces’ current defence diplomacy

efforts are focused on three key streams: (1) exchanges and
assignments with Canada’s closest allies, particularly the
United States and our Five-Eyes partners; (2) active and
ongoing involvement in multilateral organizations, prin­
cipally NATO and the United Nations; and (3) military
representation in our diplomatic missions worldwide.

The positions across all three of these streams are

filled through the Canadian Armed Forces’ “outside of
Canada establishment,” or OUTCAN. This includes
the Canadian component of NORAD headquarters and
other formations in the United States, administrative
staff and operational exchange officers, General Officers
filling important leadership positions in United States
and NATO headquarters, and Defence Attachés posted
around the world.

Defence diplomacy is critical to successful global

engagement and better understanding our complex
world. Through direct, daily contact with the military
leadership of countries around the world, the Canadian
Armed Forces’ network of Defence Attachés helps develop
a more sophisticated and nuanced understanding of the
perspectives and motivations of global actors, and of
regional security dynamics. Defence representation at
Canada’s diplomatic missions enhances local engagement


on a range of issues related to security and defence, and
provides support to Canadian foreign policy and trade
priorities. Perhaps most importantly, Defence Attachés
build and sustain relationships that facilitate operational
cooperation and communication, including in times of
crisis.

To achieve these important objectives the Canadian

Armed Forces will regularly assess the evolving security
environment, foreign policy and operational priorities, and
key capability development and training needs to deter­
mine the optimal placement of the OUTCAN footprint.

# ANNEX A:

##### FINANCIAL TRANSPARENCY


_Strong, Secure, Engaged, makes significant improvements_
to the financial transparency of the defence budget. These
improvements not only bring greater clarity to how the
defence budget is managed and spent – they are integral
to ensuring that the resources provided to deliver the
defence mandate achieve the results Canadians expect.

In the past, different parts of the defence budget were

managed according to differing, complicated and some­
times arbitrary rules. This made it challenging to spend
all of the resources provided to National Defence and
even more difficult to manage the funding associated with
complex, multi-year projects with long lead times. Not
only did this prove challenging for National Defence, but
the management and expenditure of the defence budget
was difficult to explain to Canadians and Parliamentarians.

Processes within National Defence to manage and

plan capital depreciation expenses have been aligned with
fiscal forecasting by Finance Canada on an accrual basis.
Managing capital assets on an accrual basis accounts for
the acquisition costs of the equipment over the expected
life of the asset. This enables better long-term planning
and reduces the complexity of managing budgets year-toyear. As a result, Canadians and Parliament will be able


to better understand how defence funding is being spent,
and National Defence will have the necessary flexibility
to pursue the important investments that allow the
Canadian Armed Forces to defend Canada and contribute
to a safer, more prosperous world.

Some improvements have been made in the past to

enhance transparency, including the publication of the
Defence Acquisition Guide. The Guide illustrates both
planned and potential capabilities being considered in
both the short- and long-term and also provides notional
estimates. This has provided some clarity on defence
priorities but has lacked the transparency and precision
necessary for Canadians to have confidence in how public
resources are being spent, for industry to effectively
position themselves to support defence needs, and for
Parliament to provide the necessary oversight. To deliver
on the Government’s commitment to transparency,
results and accountability, the Government of Canada
will publish the next Defence Investment Plan in 2018,
and those thereafter.

Defence manages its budget in two ways. It plans its

capital investments on an accounting, or accrual basis,
and its funding is managed on a cash basis.


-----

###### DEFENCE SPENDING – THE ACCRUAL VIEW

Defence’s budget will now provide a complete, long-term
picture of its resources, which will provide a greater ability
to plan and manage. It is composed of two components:
one for capital investments and one for operating budget
requirements (refer to Figure 1). The portion of the accrual
budget related to capital investments records the forecasted
depreciation expense of capital assets, such as equipment
and real property infrastructure, on an accounting basis.
Under the accrual basis of accounting, and consistent
with the Government of Canada’s accounting practices,
the cost of the asset is expensed starting when the asset is

Figure 1: Defence Funding – Accrual Basis


put into service and it is spread over its useful life rather
than being recorded at the time the bills are paid. The
operating portion of the accrual budget is expensed in the
year that the expenditure is made.

The capital funding provided to Defence is planned

on an annual basis based on the department’s updated
Investment Plan. The plan is based on forecasts of when
individual projects are expected to enter service, or
when the depreciation related to the asset is expected to
commence.


-----

###### DEFENCE SPENDING – THE CASH VIEW

The department receives a cash appropriation from Parliament on an annual basis. The cash budget is approved initially
through the Main Estimates and can be revised up to three times per year through Supplementary Estimates. The cash
appropriation is used to make payments for salaries, operating and maintenance costs, grants and contributions, the
purchase of capital equipment and the construction of real property infrastructure.

Figure 2 reflects the actual and forecasted Defence budget on a cash basis.

Figure 2: Actual and Forecasted Defence Budget (Cash Basis)


During recent years, a review of Defence appropriations
reveals distinct trends:

 - Budget increasing (blue line) to $22.75 billion in

2010-11. In 2004-05, the Government implemented
annual budget increases to the defence budget by
nearly $1.5 billion in successive years. After that, the
budget grew incrementally, in large part, to cover the
costs of the combat mission in Afghanistan until it
ended in 2010-11.

 - Between 2011-12 and today (purple line), budgets

have decreased to $18.7 billion. The decrease is due
to the end of the combat mission in Afghanistan, two
government deficit reduction programs: Strategic
Review ($1 billion per year) and the Deficit Reduc­
tion Action Plan ($1 billion per year), and transfers of
programs to other departments (approximately $700
million per year), such as Shared Services Canada.



 - Prior to the Defence Policy Review, the defence

budget was projected to reach $23.14 billion by
2027-28 with currently approved increases (orange
line) and remain constant thereafter.

 - Under Strong, Secure, Engaged (green line), funding,

excluding the costs of major future missions, is fore­
casted to increase to $33.4 billion by 2027-28. Cash
funding begins to decrease in 2028-29 reflecting the
completion of major capital projects.

There are, and will continue to be, periods in which

Defence does not use all of the funds allocated in a given
year. Lapses occur when the final cash expenditures for
the year are less than the total cash authorities approved
by Parliament. Contributing factors to the departmen­
tal lapse can include unused capital funding re-profiled
into future years, unspent contingency funding related


-----

to major capital and infrastructure projects and unused
funding related to ongoing operations. Like other depart­
ments, Defence has the flexibility to transfer unused fund­
ing to the next fiscal year to a maximum of 2.5 percent of
its authorized budget.

In order to reduce lapses, National Defence is improv­


will fund these new projects from surplus in-year funding
rather than request additional funding from Parliament.

National Defence has implemented similar measures


ing its capital funding forecast to ensure that the depart­
ment does not request more funding authorities from
Parliament than required. Since 2015-16, the department
has closely monitored in-year capital projects to identify
slippages and delays earlier in the year in order to quantify
the forecasted lapse. During the year, new projects may
be approved, which would have new demands for capital
funding. In order to reduce the lapse, National Defence


to reduce the operating lapse. Principally, when the
Government approves additional funding for military
deployments, funding is requested later in the process
to ensure only the required funding authorities are
requested.

Grants and Contributions lapses are largely due to


the funding provided directly to the NATO program
and fluctuations in foreign exchange rates. Forecasted
exchange rates will be closely monitored to better forecast
their impact on funding estimates.


###### BUDGETING AND PLANNING FOR CAPITAL PROJECTS

Defence plans the acquisition of equipment and real property infrastructure on an accrual basis of accounting. This
Defence funding model provides greater flexibility in managing the acquisition of large major acquisitions by allocating
the cost to acquire the asset over its useful life.


National Defence will complete a life-cycle cost estimate for all new major capital projects prior to their acquisition. CASH VIEW

A life-cycle cost estimate requires Defence to estimate all costs over the entire useful life of a capital asset; in some cases LIFE CYLE COST

this can be 50 years or more. In completing a life-cycle cost estimate, Defence must forecast four types of costs, including Ship Operating Sustainment Disposal

###### 1) DEVELOPMENT AND ACQUISITION COSTS

Development costs are all expenses associated with the
planning to acquire or build a capital asset, including
costs to design and/or modify capital assets for a specific
purpose. Acquisition expenses are all costs related to the
purchase or building of a capital asset including ancillary
costs such as the salaries for the project management staff.

On an accrual basis, the full acquisition and develop­


-----

incur an expense commencing in year 7, the year that the
ship enters service, of approximately $50 million per year
for 30 years.

On a cash basis, cash payments are made as expenses

are incurred in acquiring the ship, as detailed in graph
B. The total development and acquisition costs of
$1.5 billion will be paid in the first 7 years of the procure­
ment process.

###### 2) OPERATING COSTS

Operating costs are all expenses associated with the opera­
tion of the ship and would include such expenses as the
salary of the ship’s crew and maintenance personnel, and
fuel costs. For this scenario, as shown in blue, it is esti­
mated that it will cost approximately $50 million per year
to operate the ship and this expense would start in year 7
when the ship is put into service and will continue until
the ship reaches the end of its useful life. The total operat­
ing cost over the life of the ship would be $1.5 billion.
Operating expenditures are expensed in the year that the
payment is made. Therefore, the accounting treatment for
these expenditures is the same for both the accrual basis
(graph A) and the cash basis (graph B).

###### 3) SUSTAINMENT COSTS

Sustainment costs are all expenses associated with main­
taining and repairing equipment over its useful life,
including items such as planned maintenance, repairs and
upgrades. For this scenario, as shown in green, it is esti­
mated that the sustainment costs will be $150 million per
year starting in year 7 when the ship is put into service
and will continue until the ship reaches the end of its
useful life. The total cost over the life of the ship would be
$4.5 billion. Sustainment expenditures are expensed in the
year that the payment is made. Therefore, the accounting
treatment for these expenditures is the same for both the
_accrual basis (graph A) and the cash basis (graph B)._

###### 4) DISPOSAL COSTS

The disposal costs would include all expenses associated
with the retirement and disposal of the ship. In this
scenario, as shown in purple, it is estimated that it will
cost $50 million to dispose of the ship in year 37. The cost
to dispose of the ship will also be expensed in the year that
the payment is made. Therefore, the accounting treatment
for this expenditure is the same for both the accrual basis
(graph A) and the cash basis (graph B).


###### TOTAL COSTS

In the scenario, the total life-cycle cost for the ship over
its useful life of 30 years is estimated to be $7.6 billion.

On an accrual basis, graph A illustrates how defence

plans, budgets, and accounts for the four components of
the life-cycle cost. The department will account for the
total life-cycle costs of $7.6 billion over 30 years at a cost
of approximately $250 million per year.

On a cash basis, graph B illustrates when the funding

to pay expenses for each of the four components of the
life-cycle cost of $7.6 billion will occur. The department
will spend $1.5 billion for development and acquisition
in the first 7 years and then will spend the remaining
$6.1 billion over 30 years at a cost of approximately
$200 million per year.

###### DEFENCE SPENDING FLEXIBILITIES

With the changes made as part of Strong, Secure, Engaged
Defence will now plan and budget all of its capital projects
on an accrual basis. Flexibility is required to make adjust­
ments to the accrual budget to reflect changes in major
capital projects. Examples of changes to the plan that could
result in the need to adjust, or re-profile, accrual funding
include, but are not limited to:

 - delays associated with contracting process and approval;

 - slippages in contract performance and delivery;

 - changes to planned project timelines (future planned

projects);

 - changes in scope of the project; and

 - changes to the cost estimates as the project becomes

more advanced and updated costing information
becomes available, such as forecasted inflation, input
prices (e.g., steel), and foreign exchange rates.

It is important to understand that changes to the

accrual budget profile do not represent a “budget cut” but
rather a realignment of accrual funding to account for the
expenses over the life of the asset. For example, Budget
2017 announced that $8.48 billion in accrual budget will
be moved to later years. This amount included the realign­
ment of $3.72 billion announced in Budget 2016 plus an
additional $4.76 billion in accrual funding to align with
the timing and delivery of key large-scale capital projects.
The cash appropriation for these large–scale projects is not
being withheld. The cash is available to the department,
when it is needed and remains reserved for the exclusive
use of National Defence.

# ANNEX B:

##### OVERVIEW OF LONG-TERM FUNDING
 COMMITMENT TO CANADIAN ARMED FORCES
 CAPABILITIES


To ensure that the women and men of the Canadian
Armed Forces have the capabilities required for Canada to
be Strong at home, Secure in North America and Engaged
in the world, this policy commits to significant long-term
investment.

This includes $33.8 billion for 52 critical new capital

projects.

In addition, the policy provides $74.2 billion for exist­

ing assets and previously planned equipment, infrastructure
and information technology projects. As part of _Strong,_
_Secure, Engaged, these projects underwent a thorough cost­_
ing review, which resulted in the provision of an additional
$5.9 billion over 20 years on top of what had previously been
budgeted for these projects, to better reflect their true costs.
In total, this new vision for defence provides $108 billion for
the development and acquisition of capital equipment over
the next 20 years.

All of these projects have been costed and the costing

methodologies used were independently verified by five
external accounting firms. Throughout the process, Defence
also worked with costing experts from Deloitte who brought
expertise gained from its involvement in recent defence


reviews of close Canadian allies. This rigorous and unprec­
edented process ensures that the vision laid out in this policy
is credible and realistic.

Table 1 reflects the planned use of the accrual budget

over the 20-year horizon of this policy. It is important to
note that this table does not represent the total cost of all
planned equipment acquisitions. For example, the first new
Canadian Surface Combatant is not scheduled to be deliv­
ered until 2026, followed by the remaining 14 ships. As these
ships have an expected service life of 30 years, much of the
accrual costs will be incurred outside the 20 years reflected
in the table.

Furthermore, as these are 20-year estimates, there needs

to be flexibility to adjust the accrual budget to reflect changes
in major capital projects. The process to adjust or re-profile
these estimates over time is through the investment planning
process. Defence will publish the next Defence Investment
Plan in 2018. The Defence Investment Plan will include all
approved capital projects under the policy and will be updated
every three years. This will help ensure that Parliament and
Canadians can clearly understand future changes to the
budget, and deliver on the Government’s commitment to
transparency, results, and accountability.

###### INVESTMENT IN THE ROYAL CANADIAN NAVY

The Government will provide $17.5 billion to fund
equipment projects for the Royal Canadian Navy over the
next 20 years. This includes:

 - $2.9 billion over the next 20 years for two new equip­

ment investments in the Royal Canadian Navy to
replace obsolete components of current systems and
improve the Royal Canadian Navy’s ability to meet
evolving underwater threats.

 - $14.6 billion over the next 20 years to fully fund

planned equipment projects. For example, this
policy includes sufficient funding to acquire the full
complement of 15 Canadian Surface Combatants.
It is important to note that Table 1 only captures a
20-year view of the equipment investments commit­
ted to in this policy. As the first ship is not scheduled
to be delivered until 2026 and the fleet is expected
to be in service for 30 years, there will be significant
expenditures outside this timeframe.


###### INVESTMENT IN THE CANADIAN ARMY

The Government will provide $18.9 billion for Canadian
Army equipment projects over the next 20 years. This
includes:

 - $8.8 billion over the next 20 years for 20 new equip­

ment projects. As examples, this investment will replace
existing light and heavy trucks for use in domestic and
expeditionary operations. We will also improve the
Canadian Army’s ability to operate in Canada’s North
with a new family of Arctic-capable land vehicles, as
well as close critical capability gaps such as the Canadi­
an Army’s lack of ground-based air defence equipment,
which will allow it to defeat threats posed by airborne
weapons such as remotely piloted vehicles and aircraft
used by potential adversaries.

 - $10.1 billion over the next 20 years to fully fund

planned equipment projects. For example, the
upgrade of the Light Armoured Vehicle fleet will
improve mobility and survivability.


-----

###### INVESTMENT IN THE ROYAL CANADIAN AIR FORCE

The Government will provide $46.4 billion to fund equip­
ment projects for the Royal Canadian Air Force over the
next 20 years. This includes:

 - $20.1 billion over the next 20 years for 17 new equip­

ment projects for the Royal Canadian Air Force. For
example, this will deliver a Canadian Multi-Mission
Aircraft to replace the CP-140 Aurora Long Range
Patrol Aircraft, allowing us to maintain our techno­
logical advantage over potential adversaries. Under
the Royal Canadian Air Force’s responsibility for
space capabilities, portions of new investment will
expand the Canadian Armed Forces’ ability to use
space-based assets in support of operations. This
includes projects for enhanced communications in
the North.

 - $26.4 billion to fully fund planned equipment

projects. The new fighter program has been enhanced
to ensure the Royal Canadian Air Force can acquire
88 new advanced fighters, which will allow us to
deliver on NORAD and NATO commitments with­
out compromise.

###### INVESTMENT IN SPECIAL OPERATIONS FORCES

The Government will provide $1.5 billion to fund equip­
ment projects for Canada’s Special Operations Forces over
the next 20 years. This includes:

 - $366 million over the next 20 years for four new

projects. For example, integrated soldier system
equipment will be modernized to enhance interoper­
ability and maintain technological advantage against
potential adversaries.

 - $1.2 billion over the next 20 years to fully fund

planned equipment projects. As an example, we will
acquire an airborne intelligence surveillance and
reconnaissance platform that will enhance the ability
of our Special Operations Forces to improve their
understanding of the operational environment.

###### INVESTMENT IN JOINT CAPABILITIES

The Government will provide $4.6 billion for joint capa­
bility projects in domains such as cyber, intelligence as
well as joint command and control over the next 20 years.
This includes:

 - $1.2 billion over the next 20 years for five new equip­

ment projects and one information technology proj­
ect. For example, the Combined Joint Intelligence


Modernization project will provide a modern deploy­
able intelligence centre for land-based operations,
building on the lessons learned in recent operations.
Additionally, the Secure Radio Modernization project
will upgrade encryption capability of radios to main­
tain security and interoperability with our Five-Eyes
partners.

 - $3.4 billion over the next 20 years to fully fund planned

equipment projects. For example, we will improve the
capabilities of the Joint Deployable Headquarters and
Signals Regiment. This will include the acquisition of
portable structures to house the deployed headquarters
and the equipment employed by its staff for command,
control and communications.

###### INVESTMENT IN INFRASTRUCTURE

The Government will provide $4.9 billion over the next
20 years to infrastructure projects across Canada in order
to maintain the necessary portfolio of real property holdings.
This includes:

 - $446 million over the next 20 years for three new

infrastructure projects. For example, this funding will
enable the construction of new buildings to house
the expanded and enhanced Canadian Armed Forces
Joint Incident Response Unit. This will ensure that
the unit is able to provide chemical, biological, radio­
logical, and nuclear defence support to the Canadian
Special Operations Forces Command.

 - $4.5 billion to fully fund planned projects over the

next 20 years.

# ANNEX C:

##### GENDER-BASED ANALYSIS PLUS
 AND THE DEFENCE POLICY REVIEW 


The Defence team has a significant presence across
Canada. Its activities have global reach and influence
and the defence workforce comprises more than 100,000
military personnel and 25,000 civilian employees. Given
the depth and breadth of defence activities, our policies,
programs, services and initiatives can have profound
impacts on diverse groups of people, taking into account
gender and a range of other identity factors. GenderBased Analysis Plus (GBA+) is thus a valuable analytical
tool that helps us attain better results for Canadians by
ensuring our activities are more responsive to the specific
needs and circumstances of diverse groups of people.
Our application of GBA+ to the Defence Policy Review
process helped us deliver on the Government of Canada’s
commitment to gender equality, inclusion and evidencebased policy development.

###### EXPERT INPUT

GBA+ has been an integral analytical tool throughout the
development of this policy and has been applied at every
stage of the Defence Policy Review process, beginning
with our unprecedented public consultations.

In addition to ensuring that a diverse range of voices

participated in all of the expert roundtables held across
Canada in support of the Defence Policy Review, the
Defence team convened a special roundtable discussion
with gender and diversity experts and senior departmental
officials to examine the key questions of the review
through the lens of GBA+.

This discussion yielded valuable insights and new

perspectives on important questions considered during
the review, including methods for applying GBA+ in the
planning of military operations, how to ensure a career
with the Forces is appealing to all regardless of gender,
and the ways in which the Canadian Armed Forces can
promote human rights and gender equality on deployed
operations. The recommendations provided by experts
have contributed substantially to the formation of Canada’s
new defence policy.


###### GBA+ IN THE POLICY

We applied valuable input from the public consultation
process, along with our own GBA+ analysis, directly
to the policy development process, which had a direct
impact on the language and policy direction that appears
throughout the final document.

The influence of our GBA+ analysis is perhaps most

apparent in the first chapter of _Strong, Secure, Engaged_
which deals with our people:

 - The new policy direction on Recruitment, Training

and Retention includes specific direction to prioritize
diversity and inclusion in the Canadian Armed Forces,
to develop and implement a new Canadian Armed
Forces Retention Strategy to ensure a welcoming and
healthy work environment, and to review conditions
of service to promote more personalized and flexible
career options.

 - The policy contains a section on Leveraging Canada’s

Diversity that includes direction to appoint a diversity
champion and integrate GBA+ in all defence activities
across the Canadian Armed Forces and Department
of National Defence, from the design and imple­
mentation of programs and services that support our
personnel, to equipment procurement and operational
planning. It also institutes mandatory GBA+ train­
ing, and directs the Canadian Armed Forces to be a
leader in gender balance in the military by increasing
the representation of women by one percent annually
over the next 10 years to 25 percent representation
by 2026.

 - The policy deals directly with the need to eliminate

harmful behaviours and ensure a work environment
free from harassment and discrimination. The full
implementation of the 10 recommendations of the
Deschamps Report through Operation HONOUR
– the Canadian Armed Forces mission to eliminate
harmful and inappropriate sexual behaviour in the
military – is explicitly identified as a key priority in


-----

the policy, as well as the provision of a full range of
victim and survivor support services to Canadian
Armed Forces members.

 - This policy includes new initiatives to support the

health and resilience of the Canadian Armed Forces,
including the creation of an environment free from
stigma where military members are encouraged to
raise health concerns of any nature and seek appro­
priate help when they need it.

 - The policy recognizes that the impact of military

service goes beyond those who wear the uniform,
and includes a number of initiatives designed to help
stabilize family life for Canadian Armed Forces
members and their families. This includes improved
access to psychological services, efforts to ease the
burden of frequent relocation, resources to prevent
and respond to gender-based violence, and other
military family support programs.

In addition to the people-centred initiatives and policy

direction outlined above, the application of GBA+ to our
policy analysis influenced Canada’s new defence policy in
other important ways. For example:

 - The overarching vision for the policy articulates the

Canadian values that will guide the Canadian Armed
Forces’ engagement in the world: inclusion, compas­
sion, accountable governance, and respect for diver­
sity and human rights.

 - Our analysis of the global security environment

acknowledges the socio-economic drivers and other
human dimensions of conflict; notes that the grow­
ing number of migrants worldwide fleeing economic,
environmental, or conflict-related crises exacerbates
the negative consequences of inequality and margin­
alization; and identifies the continued prevalence of
conflict-based sexual violence as an issue of continued
concern.

 - The need to better anticipate and understand the

global security environment – the first element of our
new approach to defence – is focused on achieving
a deeper and more sophisticated understanding of
the root causes of conflict with a view to playing a
greater role in conflict prevention, intervening earlier
in the conflict cycle when necessary, and minimizing
the effects of prolonged conflict. Our GBA+ analysis
not only pointed to this requirement, but will also
be a key tool in the analysis of the security environ­
ment on an ongoing basis. Our enhanced academic
outreach program includes a commitment to be
mindful of the need for a diverse spectrum of voices
on defence and security issues.



 - The new set of eight core missions for the Canadian

Armed Forces includes a renewed commitment to
peace operations and a new mission focused on build­
ing the capacity of others. Working to implement and
advance the Women, Peace and Security agenda laid
out in the United Nations Security Council’s landmark
Resolution 1325, and subsequent related resolutions,
will be an important aspect of Canada’s international
