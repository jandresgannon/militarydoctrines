# A Security Strategy for Germany

**by Dr. Andreas Schockenhoff**

**Preliminary Remarks**

In these days, security is an important precondition for freedom. In a world of changing
security challenges and threats, political leaders must present new answers in order to
guarantee security for their citizens. Germany’s contribution to international peace missions
in Afghanistan or in the Balkan region is an evident result of the new role Germany is playing
in the field of security policy today. Increasing of security threats - such as terrorism,
proliferation, dependence on energy and raw material, or the consequences of climate change

-  require an overarching concept integrating all fields of security policy. The prevailing
discussion about current military missions accentuates the need for an intensified dialogue at
all levels of society in order to reach a consensus on national security policy.

As a contribution to this and to initiate the necessary strategic debate, the CDU/CSU
parliamentary group has presented their draft for a “Security Strategy for Germany” at a
Congress in Berlin on May 7[th] 2008. On this occasion, the draft was put up for discussion
with international security experts such as Prof. Dr. Francois Heisbourg (IISS), Baroness
Pauline Neville Jones (Shadow Security Minister UK), Leo Michel (National Defense
University Washington D.C.), and Prof. Dr. Volker Perthes (Stiftung Wissenschaft und
Politik, SWP).

To fight all possible security threats, an integrated approach is essential as no nation can
handle these challenges on its own. This is the reason why a better international
interconnectedness of security experts, scientists and politicians is required. But already at a
national level, a better co-ordination of security actors is indispensable. Therefore, the
CDU/CSU parliamentary group calls for a “National Security Council”, chaired by the
chancellor, in order to create an effective key institution for analysis- and decision making.

**A Security Strategy for Germany**

Germany, embedded in the European Union and NATO in an area of freedom, security and
justice, is one of the safest countries in the world. Yet there are many threats and risks to our
security such as terrorism, organised crime, dependence on energy and raw materials, the
proliferation of weapons of mass destruction (WMDs) and arms build-up, regional conflicts,
failing states, migration, pandemics and diseases; the impact of climate change may
exacerbate these security risks even further.


-----

Globalisation and the increasing interconnectedness of countries are fuelling the pace of
development of these risks. Developments which appear at first to be remote from our
territory can spread more quickly and compromise our security. Germany is part of the global
infrastructure of transport, energy, information and financial markets and, as an importing and
exporting nation, is particularly reliant on these critical infrastructures being kept open and
functioning, as well as on access to capital, sales and procurement markets, communication
networks, transport infrastructure and pipelines. Modern mass communications, above all the
Internet, increasing worldwide mobility and growing global awareness are linking our citizens,
companies and civil society structures together in ever denser international networks.

Our environment is being changed by the emergence of new non-state actors, by the rise of
new powers such as India and China, and by the growing importance of non-governmental
organisations. These changes are creating new necessities and possibilities in terms of
working together to resolve global and regional security problems, but shifts of power at
international level can give rise to new conflicts.

All this has a direct or indirect influence on Germany’s security situation. Germany can
respond effectively to these security risks in a globalised world only if it works in an alliance
with other countries. Addressing these challenges requires a security strategy which takes a
broad-based approach and which, along with the classical fields of foreign, European, defence,
human rights and development policy, also includes domestic, economic, energy,
environmental, financial, research and education policy networked together to provide a broad
set of instruments which are employed in collaboration with other countries, non-state actors
and organisations such as the United Nations, NATO and the European Union. The aim is to
work pre-emptively to minimise security risks and to intervene rapidly and effectively where
crises which have a bearing on our security threaten to escalate into conflicts.

**I.** **German security interests in the framework of the European Security Strategy**

The task of the German state, in accordance with the values enshrined in the Basic Law, is to
uphold justice and freedom, democracy, security and welfare for the citizens of our country,
to protect them from threats and safeguard the sovereignty and inviolability of German state
territory. Added to this are the tasks and obligations arising from Germany’s membership of
alliances such as NATO and the EU.

In the face of the above risks to our security, it is therefore in our interest

-  whenever possible, to prevent regional crises and conflicts which could compromise our
security and interests or to help to resolve them at their point of origin,

-  to counter global challenges such as the threat posed by international terrorism, the spread
of WMDs and the consequences of climate change,

-  to contribute to the upholding of human rights and the spreading of freedom, democracy
and the rule of law,

-  to promote free and unimpeded world trade including a secure supply of energy and raw
materials as the basis for our prosperity and to narrow the gap between poor and rich
regions of the world on the basis of the model of the social market economy,

-  to strengthen the cohesion of the European Union, NATO and the transatlantic partnership
and their ability to take effective political, economic and military action,

-  to deepen relations with those states which share our goals and values into strategic
partnerships, and


-----

-  to help strengthen a viable multilateral international order based on international law.

**II.** **Central challenges and strategic objectives**

The following challenges are of central importance to security in Germany.

**_1._** **_Fighting terrorism_**

Our country’s security today faces completely different but no less dangerous threats than it
did during the Cold War. Today international terrorism is the biggest threat to our security.

This danger emanates from non-state actors who deliberately conduct asymmetric conflicts.
Unlike the terrorist actions of the German terrorist group RAF (Red Army Faction) in the
1970s and 1980s, these terrorists do not have their sights set on those who hold power in the
state and society; they select soft targets. Using quasi military means they seek to create the
maximum numbers of victims in order to shake the very foundations of the state and society.

This changed threat situation demands a completely new understanding of security policy.
Since this form of terrorism does not stop at state borders and is deliberately organised and
networked internationally, the traditional distinction between internal and external security or
between a state of war and a time of peace no longer applies.

European countries are both targets of attack and logistical bases for terrorism. Germany’s
basic order founded on freedom and democracy is threatened from both outside and inside. So
far attacks on German soil have been successfully thwarted, but the possibility of future
attacks cannot be excluded.

Pulling our punches in foreign policy in an effort to reduce the danger of terrorist attack is not
a real option for Germany; the impression of weakness it would create would make terrorist
networks even more dangerous.

Fighting terrorism calls for the active deployment of political, diplomatic, civil, development
policy and police instruments. When terrorist networks operate out of weak states or use them
as a retreat, as in the case of Afghanistan prior to 9/11, it may also be necessary, however, to
use armed forces in the fight against terrorism. The military has a role in such operations
when there is a need to neutralise violent actors in order to establish security for civilian
forces, rebuild the country in question and develop good governance. Preventing access to
safe havens to which terrorists can withdraw is a central goal of security policy. This can only
be achieved in close cooperation with the international community and is a task of both
domestic and foreign policy.

Terrorists use the global infrastructure as a target for attack but also as a means of enabling
them to operate internationally. A further objective of German security policy is therefore to
prevent terrorist operations and at the same time to protect the global infrastructure. Measures
to block the financing, communications and movement of terrorist groups can be used to
**uncover and prevent attacks. Parallel to this, further precautions need to be taken in this**
country to reduce the vulnerability of critical infrastructure. This also includes giving the
Federal Criminal Police Office powers to combat the danger of international terrorism
nationwide, ensuring secure communication between all the security authorities and
deploying the Bundeswehr to work alongside the Land (federal state) and federal police


-----

internally in situations of particular danger. The aim is to prevent terrorist attacks and/or to
minimise the impact of attacks, hence making Germany less vulnerable to terrorists.

If democracy is to survive in the fight against terrorism, it is important to understand that
freedom and security are mutually dependent and are not in opposition to each other. Our
readiness to defend our values and their observance including in the fight against terrorism is
our greatest strength in this respect. Thus legal provisions conceived to defend the rights of
citizens vis-à-vis the state need to be adapted to ensure that they continue in future to
contribute to enabling people to live in freedom and security.

**_2._** **_Preventing proliferation and driving forward disarmament_**

It has so far proved impossible to halt the spread of weapons of mass destruction and their
delivery systems. Indeed there is a danger of a nuclear arms race in the Middle East and in
South and East Asia. The uncontrolled spread of ballistic missile technology, including
through the criminal smuggling of technology and know-how, threatens not only the stability
of the regions in question but the security of Germany and its alliance partners. The danger of
attack will increase if biological, chemical or nuclear materials fall into the hands of terrorist
organisations and non-state actors who are prepared to use violence. Preventing the
proliferation of WMDs and hence also their possible acquisition by terrorists is therefore a
central objective of our security policy. Our long-term goal continues to be the complete
abolition of all weapons of mass destruction.

Disarmament and arms control must in future be understood more emphatically as a strategic
instrument of German and European security policy. Germany with its rigid and restrictive
arms export and control policy cannot **contain the danger on its own. It is essential**
therefore to work multilaterally, too, to strengthen existing arms control and global nonproliferation regimes and close existing gaps. Likewise at European level, the member states
need to adopt a unified position with regard to issues surrounding export controls for dual**use products and the improvement of the internal control regime.**

To stop the spread of nuclear material, technology and know-how, countries which want to
use nuclear energy must be offered as safe an alternative as possible. A strengthened
International Atomic Energy Agency should therefore oversee the controlled supply of
nuclear energy to such countries. The enrichment of nuclear material should in future as far as
possible be carried out in a multilateral process under the oversight of the IAEA.

Another aim of our security policy, however, is to help build up systems of collective security
in other regions similar to those which have contributed to our security in Europe. We will be
able to convince other countries to renounce nuclear weapons only if the regional
environment is secure.

Alongside conventions, export controls and sanctions in non-proliferation policy, we also rely
on the nuclear deterrence capabilities of NATO and our alliance partners to protect us from
attacks with WMDs. Nuclear participation which has existed for a long time within NATO
guarantees Germany influence in this respect. Systems such as missile defence and other
components of protection render the acquisition of nuclear weapons less attractive and are
therefore in Germany’s interest. At national level, sufficient capacities must be available in
terms of NBC defence, vaccines, antidotes and supply infrastructure for the population to
reduce our vulnerability to terrorist attacks with WMDs.


-----

Our security in Europe was substantially enhanced after the end of the East-West conflict in
part by cooperative conventional arms control. It is in the interest of our security to continue
and to step up conventional arms control.

**_3._** **_Safeguarding the supply of energy and raw materials_**

Our dependence on energy and raw materials and on a secure supply infrastructure constitutes
a further risk. By 2030 Europe will have to import around two thirds of its energy supplies,
principally from Russia, the Gulf region and North Africa. Even today the steep worldwide
increase in demand for energy and raw materials, particularly in China and India, is likely to
lead to shortages, resource conflicts and rising prices. Critical developments, terrorism and
violent conflicts in supply countries could jeopardise our supply of energy and raw materials
and damage our economy. There is also a danger, however, that our dependence may be used
against us and that we may be put under pressure politically.

In view of this dual risk we need a national energy and raw materials strategy embedded in
a European energy strategy which dovetails energy and environmental policy from a security
perspective with other necessary policy fields such as climate, development, finance, research
and foreign trade. By stabilising politics, the economy and society in developing and newly
industrialising countries, development policy in particular can make a significant contribution
to guaranteeing our supply of energy and raw materials and minimise import risks.

Working together with industry, we must deepen our dialogue with transit and supply
countries. The security policy objective in this respect is to diversify energy sources, supply
countries and transport routes and to build our own strategic reserves.

Beyond this, at European level, foreign and security policy concerns must be linked more
strongly with trade policy with respect to important energy and raw materials partners and
energy partnerships must be further expanded. A single EU foreign energy policy with joint
negotiating strength could increase supply security and be far more effective than bilateral
agreements. In this context, the EU must do far more to capitalise on its leading role with
respect to concepts and technologies in the area of energy saving, energy efficiency and
renewable energies as well as fusion technology and nuclear safety research.

We are seeking a European Energy Security Union in which the members would act in
solidarity with each other in the event of supply problems; in order for this to happen member
states must be networked together and apply the same standards with respect to stockpiling.

To establish energy security and protect supplies of raw materials, it may be necessary to use
military means to safeguard the relevant infrastructure - production facilities, pipelines and
ports, etc. This is already happening today under NATO and the EU. One such example is
participation in the OEF in the Horn of Africa and the Operation Active Endeavour in the
Mediterranean to protect vulnerable sea trade routes. China and India, who as major
consumers have a similar interest in a stable supply situation, must be integrated into systems
to secure the global energy supply chain.

**_4._** **_Mitigating the impact of climate change_**

Climate change is not only an environmental and energy-related problem but a security risk,
too. The consequences of climate change are already apparent and will increase in the form of
floods, heat waves, food crises, droughts, forest fires and rising sea levels. If no progress is


-----

made in reversing this trend, there will be a considerable increase in conflicts over the
distribution of water, land and food, over migrations and refugee movements which will make
their way as far as Germany, and over the payment of compensation between those who are
most responsible for climate change and the countries most affected. This is likely to fan the
spread of local and regional conflicts right up to international wars, lead to a destabilisation of
the international system and pose a threat to global economic development. The same applies,
albeit to a lesser extent, to other environmental damage such as desertification, soil salting,
erosion and the toxic contamination of waterways and soils.

German security policy needs to focus on the effects of climate change and to help to address
the security-related consequences.

**Germany and the EU countries must meet the emission reduction targets agreed in 2007**
and persuade the other industrialised countries as well as the emerging economies and
developing countries to renew their efforts in the area of climate protection with the aim of
setting a standard per capita consumption target.

**Assisting the developing countries to adapt to climate change and deal with other**
environmental damage must be an integral part of development cooperation. In particular,
cooperation to avoid water crises must be deepened, agricultural development strategies reoriented and disaster prevention stepped up. More effective funding instruments are needed
to cope with the high costs of adaptation.

The United Nations must tackle the security risks of climate change more effectively and,
above all, pre-emptively. International law needs to be further developed, moreover, to
empower the UN Security Council to take action in cases of grave environmental destruction
and serious breaches of environmental law.

In the face of increasing environmental disasters, there is a need for action at European level,
**too, to ensure that civil protection and emergency response personnel and the armed forces of**
member states work more closely together, are called in early and are effectively coordinated.

**_5._** **_Preventing, containing and resolving conflicts_**

Weak states or areas with limited or no functioning government structures are vulnerable to
security risks and equally a source of threat to other countries. They provide an ideal retreat
for internationally operating terrorist groups and criminals, can hinder the supply of important
raw materials to our economy, provoke extremism, fuel the demand for WMDs and trigger
refugee movements, human trafficking and illegal immigrant smuggling. They also
compromise global standards in areas such as the safeguarding of human dignity or the state’s
monopoly on power.

The increasing spread of organised crime in weak states aggravates the threat of terrorism.
Acts of war, extremism and terrorism are funded from the proceeds of criminal activities,
above all from the drugs trade but also from illicit trafficking of weapons and humans, money
laundering and piracy.

It is therefore necessary for us to strengthen weak states – in particular through developmentpolicy measures – and thereby help to create new state structures or consolidate existing ones.
In order to prevent conflicts and crises, we must work together with our partners to
**strengthen our capabilities in terms of prevention to enable us to offer culturally and**
religiously sensitive stabilisation approaches.


-----

Since migration within and between countries will increase, greater efforts must be made to
address this challenge in international migration policy which must be oriented to the interests
of both the destination countries and the transit countries and countries of origin.

Weak states are a global problem. German security policy must give priority to working with
our European partners to stabilise our neighbourhood. Successes in the Balkans need to be
consolidated. We must continue to work in the EU towards ensuring the emergence of a ring
**of responsible states on our eastern borders and around the Mediterranean with whom we**
can foster partnership-based relations. In view of the rich natural gas and oil deposits in the
greater Middle East, the Black Sea, the Caspian area and in Central Asia, it is in our interests,
not least for our energy supply, to make a contribution to stability in these areas.

We also have an interest in the stable development of Africa. Here security policy also means
promoting good governance, sustainable economic growth and education and health systems,
as well as strengthening rural development and needs-oriented food production. Cooperation
with African countries also needs to be stepped up to address the security-related
consequences of climate and environmental change.

In order to help meet security-related challenges in Asia and to be able to exploit our
opportunities in the best possible way, we Europeans need to adopt a strategic approach
which must also be coordinated with our transatlantic partners. We want to strengthen the
efforts of Asian countries to bolster democracy, the rule of law, political stability and
development, to make progress in the fight against terrorism, and to establish closer regional
cooperation. We must work more consistently than before to create a network of allies and
like-minded partners in the region with whom we can pursue shared goals. We must try to
involve China to a greater extent in the process of meeting security challenges, in particular in
the areas of climate protection, disarmament, energy and raw materials supply and the
establishment of good governance in developing countries.

We must make efforts to ensure that Latin America, which has always perceived itself as
part of the western world and the democratic community, becomes a partner for global
governance in order to establish a rule-based order. To do so, we must step up the political
dialogue, intensify economic and development cooperation and expand security networking.
In addition to helping to consolidate democracy and remove deficits in the area of the rule of
law, our security interests in Latin America mainly centre on fighting drug-related crime,
human trafficking, the kidnapping industry and terrorism.

**We must expand our alliance capability and enable alliances which have a bearing on our**
security to act more effectively. As the largest contributor to the EU, second largest to the
North Atlantic alliance and third largest to the UN, we have an interest in ensuring that the
resources we commit are used effectively and in line with our strategic goals. This means that
we must further strengthen the European Security and Defence Policy in terms of its specific
civil-military response capability and expand it to make it complementary to and
interoperable with NATO. To do so we need to create appropriate strategic capabilities at
national and European level, for example, a European Gendarmerie Force or civil rapid
response teams comprising diplomats, legal experts, administrative experts and development
professionals.

There is likewise a need to further develop the transatlantic partnership, strengthen the United
Nations and adapt international law to central challenges.


-----

The North Atlantic Alliance must push forward with its political and military transformation.
In addition to continuing to develop collective military capabilities and conducting ongoing
missions to stabilise the Balkans and Afghanistan, this involves admitting new members in so
far as they fulfil the criteria and contribute thereby to the security and stability of Europe and
North America; continuing to develop a constructive relationship with Russia; broadening and
differentiating existing partnerships even from a global perspective; countering risks with
respect to problem states through strategic missile defence; including security-relevant
subjects such as cyber-defence or particular aspects of energy security in the range of tasks.

**III.** **The consequences for German security policy**

In order to pursue our interests and strategic goals, we must be more proactive and ready to
act early, rapidly, coherently and, when necessary, robustly. This applies to all the instruments
and capabilities at our disposal for crisis management and conflict prevention, which need to
be networked together more effectively.

**_1. Networked homeland defence to provide effective civil protection and disaster_**
**_management_**

In order to respond to major emergencies such as natural disasters, terrorist attacks or
disasters with biological, chemical or nuclear materials, the Federation and the Länder must
work together to provide networked homeland defence. All agencies concerned must be ready
to respond to emergencies in line with the principles of cooperative federalism. The organs,
instruments and capabilities of internal and external security must be dovetailed better
together and must also include the numerous non-governmental organisations in accordance
with their capabilities. Sufficient coordination between the Federation, Länder and local
authorities must be ensured. Increasing Germany’s ability to defend itself vis-à-vis both the
outside and the inside is the only effective way of fighting terrorism.

European coordination of civil protection and disaster relief needs to be improved – both for
joint missions in Europe and in non-European countries.

In particularly critical situations, provision must be made to enable the Bundeswehr, with its
specific capabilities in the area of disaster management and responding to terrorist threats, to
be deployed internally within specified boundaries alongside the Länder and federal police
forces. Clear legal bases for this need to be established and responsibilities defined.

Sufficient Bundeswehr personnel must be available for homeland defence tasks such as
military engineer missions, paramedical service and NBC defence. Compulsory military
service also has a role to play here, since it creates the conditions for effective national and
alliance defence. Along with the reservists of the Bundeswehr, conscripts provide a potential
pool of qualified military personnel who can be deployed in particular in the area of homeland
defence and can also provide cover for their comrades on foreign deployment.

In addition to missions abroad, it is important not to lose sight of national defence tasks. The
Bundeswehr must continue in future to be able to assist efficiently in disaster situations. The
new civil-military cooperation established at Land and district level will help in this respect
and needs to be made more efficient.

Homeland defence also includes protecting against possible terrorist attacks from the sea. To
safeguard Germany with its roughly 2,400 km of coastline, we need a national coastguard


-----

service which would coordinate all national and, where appropriate, international efforts in
the area of risk analysis and prevention for all German territorial waters.

**_2. Strengthening civil-military instruments of crisis management and prevention abroad_**

Germany, together with its alliance partners and NGOs, is already actively engaged in crisis
management. But we need enhanced capabilities in order to be able to make a more effective
contribution to crisis management and prevention. We must be in a position to act before a
crisis erupts.

Where a crisis management operation becomes necessary, the cross-departmental procedure
must be made more coherent right from the mission planning stage in Germany and all
available instruments dovetailed together more efficiently.

Where violent conflict cannot be prevented, we must be prepared to intervene at the point of
**origin to ensure that any consequences do not pose a threat to the security of Germany and its**
citizens. To ensure the success of civil-military crisis management operations abroad,
there is a need to tighten the security policy dialogue and coordination between partners in
**the EU, NATO, UN, regional organisations and NGOs and to dismantle existing obstacles.**
In deployment areas, we need more transparency in relation to services provided by
government and non-governmental agencies such as emergency relief, reconstruction and
development activities, as well as a better coordinated division of labour and cooperation
between civil society actors.

Civilian personnel and police are becoming increasingly important for stabilisation missions.
There are insufficient qualified personnel available in Germany. In order to meet demand and
fulfil Germany’s international responsibilities, there is a need to adopt a similar procedure to
that involved in the transformation of the Bundeswehr. This will involve evaluating personnel
requirements and setting operational targets in order to fill gaps in terms of personnel, training
and equipment and create the necessary legal bases as rapidly as possible.

The Bundeswehr is an important element of crisis management and prevention abroad.
Decisions on Bundeswehr deployments are taken in conjunction with our alliance partners on
the basis of our alliance commitments and objectives on a case-by-case, interest-led basis, and
therefore also in the interest of safeguarding Germany’s security and at the same time exerting
national influence on international developments.

In view of the increasing number of crises which could impact negatively on our country,
Germany must prepare for further, longer lasting deployments of the Bundeswehr to
stabilise and enforce peace. In order for us to be able to act effectively in this broad sense, the
population needs to develop a new understanding of the security risks and strategic tasks of
German security policy. It is up to our politicians, above all, to convince people, through
better communication and information, that Germany must be prepared, in collaboration with
our partners, to shoulder responsibility for global security.

The Basic Law and international law form the legal basis for all deployments of German
armed forces, including the fight against international terrorism. The armed forces may hence
be deployed under our collective defence commitment in NATO or the EU, on the basis of a
mandate from the UN or also without such a mandate but to exercise the right of self defence
enshrined in Article 51 or in pursuit of the goals of the UN Charter (humanitarian
intervention).


-----

The Bundeswehr must also be prepared to be deployed at short notice as part of a
multinational intervention force for military crisis management even if there is not time for
the German Bundestag to take the appropriate decision. The Act Governing Parliamentary
Participation in Decisions on the Deployment of Armed Forces Abroad needs to be amended
accordingly.

The Bundeswehr must be able to operate in a multinational environment across the entire
deployment spectrum. For this, there is a need to continue to force through the transformation
of the Bundeswehr to turn it into a flexible, sustainable force with a long-range capability. In
addition there is a need to make more efficient use of financial resources to fully exploit
potential European synergies. Germany’s own competitive core skills in the area of arms
technology are therefore of strategic importance, not least to secure our influence on decisions
in NATO and the EU and to enable us to participate in framing European arms policy.

**_3. Ensuring effective security policy through a National Security Council_**

A National Security Council needs to be established as a centre for political analysis,
coordination and decision-making to ensure that all forces involved in internal and external
security work together coherently. The Länder must also participate in accordance with their
responsibilities. The National Security Council should fulfil three tasks:

Firstly: comprehensive cross-departmental analysis of possible threats to internal and external
security. Translation of all information on security-relevant changes received from foreign
missions, security services and development institutions into pre-emptive, timely and targeted
foreign, security and development policy measures.

Secondly: coordination of civil-military crisis management and crisis prevention operations
abroad.

Thirdly: coordination of the introduction of appropriate defence measures and emergency
planning as well as deployment of homeland defence forces where disasters or similar events
overstretch the capacities of individual Länder.

Taking due consideration of the federal arrangement of competences in the Federal Republic
of Germany and the responsibilities of the departments of the Federal Government and their
subordinate agencies, the aim of the Council will be to ensure unified political management
and the best possible crisis management at home and abroad.

To this effect, the Federal Security Council chaired by the Federal Chancellor should be
upgraded and, using existing resources and provided with an effective staff, the members of
which will work on an interdisciplinary, cross-departmental basis, it should develop scenarios
based on standardised situation reports and prepare options for action for the executive.

**_4. Security partnership with industry and the scientific community_**

We need advanced intelligent solutions to the above threats which offer us security and
strengthen our culture of freedom. Appropriate technologies and action strategies need to be
developed in the framework of security research.

There is a particular need for research and implementation in the area of sensitive
communication infrastructures and providing a “secure identity”. Epidemiology for disease


-----

prevention, a long neglected area, and the development of terahertz technologies for improved
detection are likewise of key importance to security.

It is not only a matter of technical solutions, however. Germany has a great deal of catching
up to do in research in the humanities, social sciences and linguistics in order to ensure that a
better understanding of the world leads to a better security policy.

Companies as the key to our economic efficiency but also as owners and operators of critical
infrastructure are particularly exposed to the new security challenges both at home and abroad
and must therefore also be included in an expanded security environment. National security
protection at home and abroad must be further strengthened by joint risk assessments, the
exchange of security-related information and the development of joint protection and defence
measures to counter terrorism and organised crime, and the protection of critical infrastructure
must also be stepped up.

**IV.** **Conclusion**

We are living in a world which brings new risks but also new opportunities. Germany,
together with its EU and NATO partners, has an important role to play in responding to the
challenges which face us. Holding true to our democratic and constitutional values offers an
excellent basis for a successful security policy and, at the same time, a great opportunity to
take a pro-active role in shaping globalisation.
