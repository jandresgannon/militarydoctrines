# Estonian Long Term Defence Development Plan 2009 – 2018


-----

## Dear reader,

On 22 January 2009, the Government of the Republic of
Estonia approved the “Estonian Long Term Defence Development Plan 2009 – 2018” (hereafter Plan 2018), which
establishes the main development areas of the Estonian
Defence Forces for the next decade. Below you will fi nd an
overview of how the Plan 2018 was drafted, what will be
the main capability development areas and which investments will follow.

To reach the goals of Estonia’s national defence, our defence policy is
based on principles as agreed by the Parliament in June 2004: indivisibility of security, solidarity and cooperation, credible military deterrence,
unity of national defence and total defence, collective security, support to
development of European Union capabilities in the framework of European Security and Defence Policy and taking part in ESDP; and democratic control of Estonian Defence Forces.

Estonian military defence is part of integrated national defence and is
based on two equally important pillars – developing essential capabilities
for initial self-defence and collective defence with Estonia’s NATO membership as its cornerstone. These two together will create adequate deterrence to prevent any potential aggression. The defence of Estonian territory against any large-scale attack will be conducted as a NATO collective
defence operation together with Allies.

What are essential capabilities for initial self-defence?

This means having the capacity to resist to potential aggression until the
arrival of Allied forces as set out by the principles of collective defence.
For Estonia this will mean instant reaction to a possible crisis of military
nature or sudden attack; reception of Allied forces by air, sea, or land

and to support their actions in Estonia; defence of strategically important
areas and objects; conduct of air defence, conduct of mine clearance and
mine hunting in Estonia’s territorial waters; and conduct of mobilisation.
The Plan 2018 is directed towards building the necessary security net for
main taining Estonia’s national security.

## National defence documents

As the Plan 2018 was drafted, the hierarchy and coherence
of Estonian defence planning documentation was put in
order with amendments to the Peacetime National Defence
Act and the planning process as a whole was organised.

The backbone of Estonian defence planning is formed by the following
documents: the National Security Concept, National Military Strategy,
Long-Term Defence Development Plan, Mid-Term Defence Development
Plan, and Defence Forces Operational Plan.

The development of the National Security Concept is led by the Ministry
of Foreign Affairs in coordination with other governmental agencies, and
approved by the parliament of Estonia. The National Security Concept
forecasts potential security risks threatening the country, defi nes objectives for the development of all actors in security arena and supports
stable development of the nation’s security. The current National Security
Concept dates from June 2004.

After that, the Ministry of Defence prepares the National Military Strategy, which is approved by the Government. The National Military Strategy
defi nes threat scenarios, level of ambition in national defence, discusses
general defence model of Estonia and sets priorities of national military defence. The current National Military Strategy dates from January
2005.

As a further development from the National Military Strategy, the Ministry
of Defence and the Estonian Defence Forces jointly develop the Long-Term
Defence Development Plan which is approved by the government. This
document defi nes military capabilities to be developed in longer term,


and describes the necessary requirements for human, time and fi nancial
resources for their achievement. The Long-Term Defence Development
Plan is reviewed every four years. The current plan, the Plan 2018 was
approved on January 22, 2009.

The method for detailed development of capabilities as set out in the longterm plan is established within a four year Mid-term Defence Development
Plan, approved by the Minister of Defence, and reviewed each year.

The last planning document in this chain is the Defence Forces Operational
Plan approved by the Chief of Defence. This establishes how specifi c military tasks will be carried out with existing military capabilities and units.

## How was the Plan 2018 drafted?

The Plan 2018 was drafted in close cooperation between the
experts of the Ministry of Defence, Headquarters of the Estonian Defence Forces, Headquarters of the Defence League,
and the Information Board.

The fi rst step in drafting of the Plan 2018 included compilation of potential threat scenarios. The scenarios were based on the newest strategic
threat assessment and were done in cooperation of experts from the Information Board, the Security Police Board, the Defence Forces Intelligence
Department and the Ministry of Defence. The scenarios addressed potential threats to Estonia in the near future requiring the use of the defence
forces and the Defence League.

We have analysed the full spectrum of potential threats to Estonia. The
strategic threat assessment and threat scenarios are confi dential due to
obvious reasons, but in general it can be said that in the current security environment there is no threat of a large-scale military attack to Estonia as a member of NATO. Still, the threat scenarios illustrate that Estonia
must be ready to defend herself in case of external pressure and show of
force, for which it is necessary to create a credible and functioning deterrence together with Allies. In general terms, the threats to nation’s security
remain as described in the National Security Strategy.


-----

Based on these illustrative scenarios operational analysis was conducted. This identifi ed military capabilities required for national defence. In
the following step capabilities required were compared with capabilities
existing – this identifi ed capability gaps. The assessment of current and
required military capabilities was carried out to establish an overall picture
of the current situation and desired end state. Capabilities required were
then prioritised after weighted risk analysis. The main logic behind the
prioritization was wide usability of capabilities while minimizing the risk
to national defence, taking also into account possible resource implications – hence focusing on usable, fl exible and interoperable capabilities.
In the following programming stage we determined the level to which any
capability should be developed and their resource implications: in terms
of fi nances, personnel and time.

The programming resulted in three categories of capabilities:

1. Capabilities that are necessary for national defence, but are too
expen sive for Estonia and can be achieved only in cooperation
with NATO and Allies. In the case of Estonia, such capabilities are,
for example, fi ghter aircraft and attack helicopters. Strategic Airlift
Capability is another example of capabilities in this category, and
to ensure this, Estonia has joined NATO’s Strategic Airlift Capability
(SAC) project.

2. Capabilities that are necessary for national defence, but are unreachable within the next 10 years. Such capabilities identifi ed during
programming are, for example, multiple launch rocket systems with
a range of up to 70 kilometres and surface-to-surface missile systems required for destroying surface naval targets. The development
of such capabilities could be considered after 2018 or in case some
other projects in development will have signifi cantly lower resource
implications than originally planned.

3. Capabilities that are necessary for national defence and the development of which can be launched within the next 10 years. Those
capabilities form the basis of the Plan 2018.

All in all, such a planning model guarantees that the Plan 2018 corresponds to the current security environment, is drafted considering both
military and civil expertise, and is consistent with existing resources.


## Which capabilities will be developed 2009 – 2018?

Communication and intelligence systems will improve

One of the main priorities of the Plan 2018 is to develop the command
and control, intelligence, surveillance and communications systems of the
EDF. In modern warfare, uninterrupted, encrypted and jam proof communications play an especially important role. Without proper communications it is impossible to conduct effective command and control of military units. In order to develop this capability, large scale investments are
planned for the next 10 years for all levels of command, starting with a
single soldier on battlefi eld equipped with modern systems all the way to
leadership of defence equipped with modern command- and communications assets. The development of modern command, control and communications capabilities is not only important for effectively commanding our
own forces, it must also be interoperable with those of our Allies. In a way
we are talking of “invisible” capabilities for average citizen, capabilities
that cannot be seen on parades – but at the same time they require huge
fi nancial investments that cannot be substituted with anything less.

The development of intelligence and surveillance capabilities will provide the senior military-political leadership with situational awareness
on events taking place on Estonian territory, in airspace, and territorial
waters. These capabilities should guarantee adequate advance warning in
case of potential threats and will provide military-political leadership with
enough time to make respective decisions and necessary preparations. In
order to develop these capabilities, additional medium-range radar systems and various types of sensors will be acquired.

Figuratively speaking, the intelligence and surveillance systems will provide the EDF with eyes and ears to collect important information in realtime. Command, control and communications systems will ensure that
decisions are based on optimal information and will reach all levels of
command in real-time.


-----

Ämari Air Base will be transformed into a modern NATO airfi eld

Estonia will complete the reconstruction of Ämari Air Base, which will
enable fi ghter aircraft of our NATO Allies to reside in Ämari, just as they
do in Lithuania today. Within the 10-year planning period Estonia will not
develop her own air policing capability, while a study for search of solution
after 2018 has been launced in cooperation with Latvia and Lithuania.

Ämari Air Base will also play an important role as a host nation support
(HNS) air base whenever a need for Allied reinforcement would be required to guarantee security of Estonia. Upon completion of reconstruction
works, Ämari will have the capability to receive strategic transport aircraft
and the capability to process cargo.

Air defence will improve signifi cantly

According to the Plan 2018, a mobile short to medium-range air defence
capability will be developed during the next decade, and the existing
short-range air defence capability will be improved. The medium-range
air defence includes relevant surveillance and command systems and
assets that can destroy targets at a distance of up to 30 km. When shortrange air defence is considered only for protection of a specifi c object or
unit, then the planned short to medium-range air defence will be suitable
for defending the airspace of an entire large city and its surroundings. As
Estonia is developing a mobile system, this capability is not related to the
defence of a specifi c area, but will be located according to requirements,
for example to defend the airspace of Tallinn, or to defend a specifi c battle
area or to secure an HNS operation.

According to the Plan 2018, the short-range air defence capability will
also be improved. Currently, the short-range air defence capability is
comprised of the air defence battalion (as part of the infantry brigade),
equipped with the SAM system Mistral and the anti-aircraft twin autocannon ZU-23-2. According to the Plan 2018, the existing number of missile
systems will be increased and additional air defence units will be established in defence districts.


Infantry brigade as the spearhead of the Army

The development of a high readiness infantry brigade will remain as one
of the main priorities for the land forces. In addition to the professional
Scouts Battalion, the brigade is comprised of reserve infantry battalions
and support units. Similarly to today, one infantry battalion and about a
third of all support units of the brigade will be formed and trained from
conscripts during an annual training cycle.

Over the following years, reserve trainings will also be enhanced to better
guarantee combat readiness of the units of the defence forces.

Mechanised units will improve combat capability

According to the Plan 2018, mechanised units will be developed within the brigade framework over the next decade. This will be achieved
by acquiring either tanks or infantry fi ghting vehicles and by training a
respective unit. In conclusion, mechanisation will give the infantry brigade
a better defence, increased fi repower and greater mobility on battlefi eld.

The PASI armoured personnel carriers used by the Scouts Battalion currently are primarily meant for transport of the infantry. Whether the formation of mechanised units will take place through the procurement of tanks
or infantry fi ghting vehicles will be decided based on additional analysis.

The development of mechanised units will become one of the most challenging and resource-heavy projects during the planning period that would
require training of additional personnel and development of complex logistic support.

Further upgrading of anti-tank capabilities

One of the important priorities of the Plan 2018 is to further upgrade the
anti-tank capabilities of the EDF. This includes additional acquisition of
one-shot anti-tank weapons, recoilless rifl es and the anti-tank guided missile systems Milan. Also, additional units will be established both in the
EDF and in the Defence League. The goal for the development of these capabilities will be to increase the general fi repower of the infantry in combat.


-----

## Where will the defence forces be located and what kind of infrastructure will there be?

The infrastructure of the EDF – barracks, warehouses, headquarters, and training fi elds – must be such that they would
enable the forces to focus on their main task – to prepare for
national defence and to train units.

In the course of drafting the Plan 2018, the Ministry of Defence carried out an evaluation of real estate under the jurisdiction of the ministry.
Based on the capabilities described by the Plan 2018 an infrastructure
development plan was developed for the next decade.

One of the major construction projects in the next decade will be the
reconstruction of Jägala Training Centre where, up until the beginning of
the 2000s, the Kalevi Infantry Battalion was based.

The Soviet era buildings on the Viru Infantry Battalion’s training centre in
Jõhvi will be demolished and the training centre will be completely renovated. Complete renovation will also take place at the Kuperjanov Infantry
Battalion in Võru, the Tapa Training Centre in the North-East Defence
District and the Kalev Infantry Battalion in Paldiski. The infrastructure of
the Naval Base, the Estonian National Defence College and the Defence
Forces Võru Battle School will be renovated.

All training areas for the EDF will be developed during the planning period
to ensure proper training conditions.

The plan includes renovating or establishing all headquarters and support
centres of the Defence League by the end of the next decade. The plan is
also to construct at least ten 300-metre long fi ring ranges that conform
to all requirements, so that every unit of the Defence League would have
basic possibilities for proper fi ring training in their territory.


The voluntary Defence League as a broad and effective military
organisation

During the next decade, the funding and equipping of the Defence League
will improve, which aims to increase active membership of the Defence
League. While previously the Defence League has not been a fi rst priority,
then the Plan 2018 foresees equipping the Defence League with assets
similar to those of the EDF. The aim is to move from the formation of big
and cumbersome territorial battalions to formation of smaller, companysized units manned according to the territoriality principle of the Defence
League – combatants from one area form the same units. The Defence
League will be the basis for training of better equipped and prepared company size combat capable infantry units and internal defence companies
for the defence of specifi c objects.

Navy keeps its focus on mine countermeasures capabilities

The Navy will continue to develop mine clearance capabilities that are
necessary for participating in international operations and for guaranteeing host nation support. As a new development program, new multirole high-speed patrol vessels will be procured for the Navy during the
planning period. The purpose of the latter will be to enhance the control
of Estonian territorial waters and to improve maritime surveillance. The
Navy’s command and control capability will also be improved.

The Air Force will receive tactical transportation capability

In addition to the requirement for additional radars mentioned above, a
clear need for transport helicopters was identifi ed during the planning
process. The helicopters to be acquired should be multifunctional. In
peace time they should enable the transportation of personnel, performance of monitoring fl ights, support medical evacuation, and support to
other government agencies. An adequate search and rescue (SAR) capability is one of the preconditions for potential basing and operating air
policing assets in Estonia.


-----

## What will be the size of the Estonian Defence Forces?

The Estonian Defence Forces currently has approximately
3000 professional servicemen and –women, and during the
next decade this number will increase to about 4000.

The increase in the number of regular members of the EDF is necessary
for the development of new military capabilities, but also for more qualitative training of the reserves and manning of professional units. According
to the Plan 2018, the number of offi cers being trained in the Estonian
National Defence College and the number of non-commissioned offi cers
being trained in the Estonian Defence Forces Võru Battle School will increase. This will be an ambitious task, requiring focused and successful
recruiting and retention of personnel.

During the planning period, the annual number of conscripts called up for
compulsory military service (currently approximately 2500) will remain
at the same level or slightly increase. Conscription will remain the main
resource for manning of reserve units and form a recruiting base for regulars of the Defence Forces. The deteriorating demographic situation in
Estonia will infl uence the number of conscripts called up annually, leading
to a decrease in the number of young men fi t for compulsory military service. Greater emphasis must thus be placed on the quality of training
during conscription.

While the Plan 2018 was drafted, a joint working group of the Ministry
of Defence and the EDF analysed the possibility to replace the existing 8
and 11 month long conscription with the so-called “6-9-12 model”, as
used in Finland. In such a system, the conscripts belonging to ranks of
private would serve for six months, specialists for nine months and conscript junior non-commissioned offi cers and reserve platoon commanders
for 12 months. Even though this system would reduce the time of conscript training, and would use the infrastructure of the defence forces more
intensively, it would also require a larger number of instructors. This is not
achievable in the short-term and therefore cannot be implemented before
2014. The issue will be further addressed in 2012.


The number of the EDF personnel available for crisis management, including reservists, will increase during the planning period from today’s
16 000 to 25 000, with additional the units of the Defence League. In
2018, the EDF will consist of centrally subordinated units, a mechanise
d infantry brigade in the Army with all its support units, reserve units formed in Defence Districts and the units of the Defence League. The war
time structures of the Navy and Air Force will remain similar to their peace
time structure.

## How much will it cost?

A planning assumption for drafting the Plan 2018 was the
increase of defence budget to 2 percent of GDP by 2010 and
keeping this level in the following years.

In general, the defence budgets for the next 10 years should add up to a
total of 60 billion EEK. About 40% of that amount is planned to be spent
on procurement and construction, and the remaining 60% on operating
and personnel costs.

The capability projects and the resulting investments will be detailed with
a four year Mid-term Development Plan, which will be approved by the
Minister of Defence and reviewed annually. These plans will consider in
more detail the existing capabilities and current economic situation, which
directly infl uences the defence budget. Estonian defence planning has
enough fl exibility to adjust to a changing economic environment.


-----

## The end result: what will the Estonian Defence Forces look like in 2018?

The EDF of 2018 will have adequate surveillance and intelligence capabilities to detect potential threats to Estonia,
a high-readiness and partly armoured/mechanized infantry
brigade, Defence Districts formed of Defence League and
reserve units, adequate air defence for defending strategic
objects and army units, as well as an organised reserve training and mobilisation system enabling the increase of the
number of personnel in case of any potential threat.

The Estonian Air Force, by 2018, will be able to accommodate fi ghter
aircraft of NATO at Ämari and receive Allied transport aircraft for a potential HNS operation, as well as conduct tactical transport with helicopters.
The Estonian Navy, by 2018 will have a modern mine countermeasures
capability and will participate in international cooperation with her MCM
vessels continuously and sustainably.

We should keep in mind that the Plan 2018 is focussed solely on development of Estonia’s military defence. National defence is a wider issue,
based on the principle of total defence in Estonia – which includes nation’s
military, civil, economical, social and psychological defence. This requires wider attention and planning that solely within the responsibility of the
Ministry of Defence.

Upon successful implementation of the Plan 2018, The EDF of 2018 will
be larger in size, will have better training, more advanced equipment, will
be more interoperable with NATO. In one word, the EDF 2018 will be
more capable.


## The Long-Term Defence Development Plan 2009 – 2018 (Plan 2018) summary

1. Development of defence planning in Estonia can be characterised
as the search for a perfect plan that would solve all questions related to national defence. It is clear that – against a background of
limited resources and changing security environment – the requirement is rather for an organised process offering modern solutions:
“evolution instead of revolution”.

2. Today we have achieved a clear vision of what a suitable defence
planning model for Estonia should look like; one that considers the
specifi cities of Estonia as a small state, but also considers the requirements for interoperability with Allies in defence of our common
values. That being said, the Plan 2018 is not a document giving
answers to all the challenges rising today or in the foreseeable future.
It is rather a tool translating today’s strategic security and defence
policy guidelines into military capabilities and respective development programmes within specifi ed resources and timeframes.

3. The policy guidance for the Plan 2018 was derived from the
following documents: National Security Concept (2004), National
Military Strategy (2005), NATO’s Strategic Concept (1999), NATO’s
Comprehensive Political Guidance (2006) and The European Security Strategy (2003).

4. The foundations of Estonia’s national defence rely on two strategic
pillars: NATO membership and initial self-defence capability. These
pillars together create a credible deterrence. Upon need, Estonia’s
military defence will be conducted as a collective defence operation
of NATO, as prescribed in Article 5 of the North Atlantic Treaty.

5. As the fi rst step in developing the Plan 2018, scenarios requiring
the use of Estonian Defence Forces (EDF) and the Defence League,
based on the National Military Strategy and strategic threat assessment, were drafted. These scenarios covered the full spectrum of
operations. Based on scenarios, operational analysis was conducted, and further more detailed planning situations were developed.
This – with consideration to established assumptions, exceptions


-----

and limitations – identifi ed minimum military capabilities required
to fulfi l previously established tasks. The comparison of existing and
required capabilities identifi ed capability gaps, or shortfalls. These
were prioritised based on risk analysis of threat assessments and
the usability of capabilities in planning situations. The subsequent
programming stage established recommended development levels
and resource requirements for these capabilities. As a result of programming process, three categories of capabilities were identifi ed:
capabilities militarily valid, but disproportionately costly for Estonia
– these could be developed in cooperation with NATO and/or Allies;
capabilities militarily valid, but not feasible to be developed within
the planning cycle; capabilities militarily valid and feasible within
the 10-year planning period.

6. In terms of fi nancial resources, the planning assumption was the
increase of defence expenditures to meet 2% of GDP by 2010, and
sustaining that level thereafter.

7. In terms of human resources, the Plan 2018 foresees an annual increase of regular EDF members by 125. The priority is to signifi cantly
increase the training capacity of the Estonian National Defence College and the Estonian Defence Forces Võru Battle School. Also, the
number of active members of the Defence League is expected to
increase. To improve the capabilities of staff- and senior offi cers, the
priority is to further develop the Baltic Defence College and to continue to fulfi l the responsibilities of Estonia as Host Nation.

8. Compulsory military service will remain the basis for manning the
units and for recruiting to the EDF. While drafting the Plan 2018,
an analysis of compulsory military service was conducted – this
suggested retaining of the current compulsory military service model
also for the near future.

9. To achieve goals of the security policy the Plan 2018 foresees continued participation of Estonia’s military capabilities and units in
operations led by NATO, EU and/ or coalitions of the willing outside
of national territory. The planning assumption to achieve this includes NATO’s usability criteria. Participation in operations outside of
Estonia serves as a development instrument for the EDF and the
Defence League.

10. All capabilities covered by the Plan 2018 were analysed and asses sed according to NATO capability statements. This gives bet ter
preconditions to achieve interoperability with Allies. The planning


goals, agreed upon in NATO’s collective defence planning process,
are achievable. New and usable capabilities will be provided through
planned development process, and these can later be declared as
part of collective defence. The deployability of capabilities and units
will be agreed upon in cooperation with the Ministry of Foreign
Affairs while drafting the Mid-Term Development Plan.

11. In order to increase Estonia’s commitment to NATO’s collective security, it is vital to fully develop NATO’s Cooperative Cyber Defence
Centre of Excellence (CCDCOE) into an organisation that will bring
together competence on cyber security and that will help NATO and
Allies to develop military capabilities in this fi eld.

12. According to the Plan 2018, investments to command and control, intelligence, surveillance and communications systems will increase. Creating modern command and control, intelligence, surveillance and communications capabilities is a strategically important
goal. This will ensure early warning to prepare for crisis and also
adequate command and decision making process of military units
in times of crisis.

13. Estonia continues to invest to Ämari Air Base in order to enable the
execution of air policing operations and achieving the capacity to
base fi ghter aircrafts at Ämari. The allocations of costs relating to air
policing will be agreed with Allies. The visible presence of NATO and
Allies on Estonian territory and airspace continues to be important.

14. One of the priorities in military defence is the development of capabilities to ensure air defence. According to the Plan 2018, a limited
mobile short-to-medium-range air defence capability will be developed and the existing army short-range air defence capability will be
enhanced through the procurement of additional weapons systems
and creation of new air defence units.

15. The priority for the Army is the development of a high readiness
infantry brigade. In order to increase the readiness of brigade, the
reserve period of the units will be extended. Additional measures
will include a signifi cant increase of reserve training, improvement
of the reserve personnel registry, as well as formation and mobilisation system. Battalion level leadership training and maintaining of
qualifi cations will be improved.

16. The Plan 2018 foresees a need for developing mechanised units,
the task of which is to support ground operations. The program


-----

analyses the procurement of tanks or infantry fi ghting vehicles for at
least one battalion.

17. The further development of anti-tank capability remains a priority.
The Plan 2018 foresees modernisation and further procurement of
existing anti-tank weapons systems. It also foresees the formation
of additional anti-tank units in the EDF and the Defence League.

18. The voluntary defence organisation – the Defence League is the
main provider of capabilities for territorial defence. Development
priorities of the Defence League during the planning period include
the increase of the number of active members, the establishment
of necessary command and control capabilities for battalion and
Defence District level, the development of rapid reaction units and
the improvement of combat capabilities.

19. The Defence League will focus on the preparation of infantry companies, internal defence companies and formation units. The measures foreseen by the Plan 2018 will enable the Defence League to
become even more signifi cant military deterrent.

20. In terms of naval and air operations, the Plan 2018 foresees the
focus on development of capabilities crucial for the prevention of
crisis and ensuring of Host Nation Support.

21. Among new development programs for the Navy is the procurement
of multirole fast patrol boats to ensure defence of territorial waters
and to improve maritime surveillance. The Navy’s capabilities for
command and control and shore-to-vessel communications will be
improved.

22. The Plan 2018 identifi ed a need to launch a multi-role helicopter
program. The main goal will be to ensure the tactical transport for
rapid reaction units, to perform monitoring and identifi cation fl ights
and to establish medical evacuation capability.

23. The implementation of all development programmes by the end of
the planning period will result in an interoperable National Defence
organisation that corresponds to NATO’s usability criteria. The
defence organisation will be a signifi cant deterrent and will have
necessary capabilities to fulfi l all required tasks.

24. By the end of the planning period the size of the EDF consists of
4000 regulars. The EDF strength, including the reserve units, will
be 25 000 persons and additional Defence League units
