### FOREWORD

Future conflict will involve sophisticated

cyber warfare. Nations across the globe have
recognised the strategic value and asymmetric
advantage of investment in offensive cyber
capabilities. They continue to evolve and
advance their capabilities, strategies and
tactics, contributing to a deteriorating strategic
environment. As you read this Strategy,
adversaries and cyber criminals are probing
Defence’s networks for vulnerabilities to
exploit. They are seeking insights into Defence
capabilities, platforms, and personnel. They
are seeking to steal data, slow Defence’s work,
impact operations and identify gaps to exploit
in the future.

Malicious cyber activity now represents one
of Defence’s most critical risks. Our cyber
security is therefore now one of our most
critical tools to defend our people, capabilities,
and ultimately, our nation. Defence’s response
must be deliberate and decisive to address
the worsening cyber threat environment. The
_Defence Cyber Security Strategy will position_
Defence to defend Australia and advance our
security and prosperity.

This Strategy details how Defence will combat
cyber threats and ensure its capabilities are
secure against attacks from adversaries. This
will require a concerted and coordinated
effort across the entire Defence ecosystem,
from Australian Defence Force and Australian
Public Service personnel to Defence’s industry
partners and supply chain. Each part of this
ecosystem contributes to, and has a role to play
in ensuring, the cyber security of Defence, and
our nation.

This Strategy presents the path to a cyber
resilient Defence and the principles to maintain
a strong cyber security posture in a shifting
strategic environment. It is essential that this
be accompanied by strong leadership, resolve


and a willingness to transform from across the
Defence ecosystem. Together we can ensure
a strong Defence, and the future security and
prosperity of Australia.

In response to our rapidly changing strategic
circumstances, the Government has committed
to a Defence Strategic Review that will examine
force structure, force posture and preparedness,
and investment prioritisation, to ensure

Defence has the right capabilities to meet our
growing strategic needs. In an environment
characterised in particular by increased

cyber threats, the Defence Strategic Review
will provide a comprehensive assessment so
Defence remains positioned to meet growing
regional and global challenges.

Consequently, the implementation of the
_Defence Cyber Security Strategy_ will be
responsive to and informed by the outcomes of
the Defence Strategic Review so that it maintains
strong strategic alignment and is able to meet
Defence's future needs.

### EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

Defence must continue to improve its cyber security if it is to defend
against constant malicious cyber activity and succeed in future conflicts.
This is necessary for the continued fulfilment of Defence’s mission, and the
continued delivery of critical functions upon which our national interests
rely, and all Australians expect.

The Strategy will shape the Defence portfolio’s cyber security for the next
ten years. It establishes the guiding principles and strategic objectives to
enhance Defence’s cyber security capabilities in line with the shifting threat
environment. The Strategy also establishes four priority action areas that
outline objectives to be achieved over the next three years. This will set the
necessary foundations for Defence to be a cyber security exemplar now, and
into the future, as cyber threats evolve.

This Strategy will ensure Defence can continue to transform, adapt and
evolve securely. It will support Defence’s ability to Shape, Deter and Respond:
shaping its cyber security environment through uplift, standards setting
and strengthened partnerships; informing its deterrence activities through
improved visibility of adversaries’ activity; and refining its ability to respond
by enhancing its cyber security posture and limiting adversaries’ ability to
conduct malicious cyber activity against Defence.

The nature of cyberspace means that every capability, every individual and
every industry partner represents a target and opportunity for adversaries.
This Strategy recognises that the unprecedented threat environment
Defence faces extends across its industry partners. The need for industry
partners to establish and maintain strong cyber defences has never been
more critical. This Strategy can only be achieved through a concerted effort
across Defence’s entire ecosystem, working together to strengthen our
collective cyber security and defend Australia.

### STRATEGIC CONTEXT


The _2020 Defence Strategic Update detailed_
the deteriorating nature of Australia’s strategic
environment and the contributing role of cyber
capabilities. Cyber threats are increasing in
sophistication and scale. Cyber has emerged
as a recognised warfighting domain and cyber
warfare will be a critical component of future
conflict.

Defence operates in complex and contested
terrains that present significant and unique
challenges for its cyber security capabilities.
The requirement for cyber security is more
critical than ever, and the scope extends well
beyond Defence’s immediate networks and
warfighting capabilities. Defence industry and
supply chains, related critical infrastructure, and
Australia’s research and development sector
are a significant target for adversaries. Defence
relies on the security of more systems and
capabilities than ever before, and in an
increasingly hostile cyber threat environment.
This calls for a hand-in-hand approach with
industry to uplift the security of the entire
Defence ecosystem.


The threat does not stop at the high-end
capabilities of Defence and industry. Individuals
within the Defence ecosystem, both Defence
personnel and industry contractors, are

being targeted as an indirect entry point
to compromise Defence’s networks and

capabilities. Adversaries continue to deploy
unrelenting and increasingly sophisticated
malicious cyber campaigns at scale to

compromise individuals, collect their data, and
infiltrate, disrupt and deny Defence capabilities.
Everyone connected to the Defence ecosystem
must play their part.

Poor cyber security has the potential to severely
impact the utility of Defence’s ships, aircraft,
weapons systems and supporting capabilities,
such as bases and critical infrastructure. As
a likely pre-cursor to and critical element of
future conflict, Defence’s cyber security posture
will likely be a determining factor of Australia’s
success or defeat.

Ultimately, the fulfilment of Defence’s mission is
dependent on cyber security.


###### Cyber-attacks can directly compromise military capability and operations. Cyber-enabled activities can also drive disinformation and destabilising interference in economies, political and social systems and infrastructure.

### STRATEGIC VISION

The Strategic Vision provides an enduring direction for Defence’s cyber security over the next ten years.
Delivering on this Vision is critical to ensure Defence has the cyber security capabilities, structures and
partnerships necessary to deliver on its core mission, and combat current and future threats in an
ever-evolving strategic environment.

The Strategic Vision is:


-----

### PRINCIPLES

The Strategic Vision highlights guiding Principles that must drive all of Defence’s future cyber security
activities over the next ten years. These Principles provide a guiding framework for all Defence
personnel, and the enterprise at large, on how to focus and align cyber security efforts, capabilities
and resources at every level and across every function.

The Principles are:

### CYBER SECURITY GOVERNANCE


Strong cyber security governance is critical to
ensuring the effectiveness of Defence’s people
and capabilities. While Defence has a strong
foundation, rapid changes in technology
and the strategic environment necessitate a
refresh. Defence’s cyber security governance
frameworks and policies must enable Defence
to effectively combat cyber threats, succeed in
its warfighting mission and ultimately defend
the nation.

An optimised cyber security operating model
is key to achieving these effects. Defence’s
cyber security operating model must support
a coordinated and consistent approach to
cyber security, delivering further operational
efficiencies as Defence’s cyber security

capabilities continue to be asked to do more
in an increasingly complex environment. The
operating model will need to account for the
increasingly cross-cutting nature of cyberspace,
while ensuring that appropriate mechanisms
are in place to enhance Defence’s cyber security
risk management and investment decisions. It
should further enable strategic partnerships
with industry, acknowledging industry partners’
critical role in Defence’s overall cyber security
posture. It must also enable deeper cyber
security partnerships and interoperability with
our allies.

###### OBJECTIVES


The operating model refresh will include a
strengthened and empowered central cyber
security entity that is enabled to manage
Defence’s collective cyber security risks,

provide clear, consistent and rapid guidance,
respond to evolving cyber threats with speed
and agility, and drive a coordinated approach
to cyber security. This will be supported by
the delineation of clear cyber security roles,
responsibilities and authorities across the
enterprise, and a recalibration of Defence’s
cyber security workforce to ensure efforts
continue to be aligned to mission priorities. This
will take into consideration the growing role of
industry partners in strengthening Defence’s
cyber security.

Defence will continue to adopt best-practice
standards and review its cyber security policies
to ensure frameworks support a consistent
and fit for purpose approach to cyber security.
These policies must support wide adoption
and application across the enterprise, and with
industry partners. Critically, these policies must
enable Defence’s cyber security capabilities in
times of conflict and cyber warfare, reinforce
a reformed operating model and ensure
capabilities continue to be cyber secure in
response to rapidly changing threats.


The objectives of the initial cyber security governance actions are to:

- implement an optimised cyber security operating model that enables Defence’s cyber security capabilities

and its warfighting mission;

- maximise operational efficiencies and return on investment through strengthened and more centralised cyber

security governance;

- clearly define cyber security roles, responsibilities, accountabilities and authorities across Defence;

- adopt clear, practical and consistent cyber security policies that support the cyber resilience of Defence

capabilities during all phases of operations, including conflict; and

- set a cyber security baseline through the adoption of recognised and Defence-relevant cyber security

standards.


-----

### CAPABILITY MANAGEMENT


All of Defence’s capabilities operate to some
extent in and through cyberspace. This poses
a challenge given Defence’s diverse and widely
dispersed array of networks and warfighting
capabilities. Coupled with a worsening cyber
threat environment, a shift in how Defence
manages the cyber security of its capabilities,
and how it leverages its partnerships with
industry is required.

Defence will undertake a range of activities
to improve the foundational aspects of
procurement arrangements and to strengthen
strategic partnerships with industry. Given
the fast paced cyber threat environment,
Defence will work with industry to streamline
cyber security capability acquisition pathways
and processes. This work will include

exploring potential processes and partnership
arrangements necessary to enable the rapid
acquisition of Australian and allied expertise in
the event of a crisis.

Defence will also improve how it manages
the cyber security of capabilities, ensuring
cyber resilience and battle readiness. This
will include elevating cyber security as a key
consideration in the acquisition, sustainment
and decommissioning of capabilities, and the
improvement of risk management processes.
Acknowledging industry’s key role in the
cyber security of Defence capabilities, Defence

###### OBJECTIVES


will continue to strengthen the _Defence_
_Industry Security Program to both improve_
cyber security outcomes, and streamline the
program for industry. These activities will
ensure a coordinated approach from Defence
and industry to uplift cyber security across the
Defence ecosystem.

To ensure the best use of its finite resources,
Defence will reform its risk analysis mechanisms
to enhance capability prioritisation. This activity
will focus on ensuring Defence capabilities are
continually directed towards critical risks. This
will also support a reduction in the number
of legacy systems that create cyber risk for
Defence, while enabling Defence to effectively
prioritise, maintain and secure those assets
unable to be replaced or decommissioned.


The objectives of the initial capability management actions are to:

- enable the rapid and agile acquisition of cyber security capabilities and expertise;

- ensure cyber security requirements are adequately considered in the design and acquisition of new capabilities,

and improve cyber security across all phases of the lifecycle;

- signal Defence’s expected cyber security standards to industry and its supply chain, and deliver an uplift

across Defence’s ecosystem;

- effectively manage cyber security across Defence’s diverse range of capabilities; and

- ensure Defence’s finite resources and capabilities are focussed on critical risks and mission priorities.


-----

### PEOPLE

At the core of Defence’s cyber security capability
is its people. Unlike other warfighting domains,
everyone has a direct role in the security of
the cyber domain. Everyone that interacts with
the Defence environment and supply chain
presents a potential target and opportunity
for adversaries. One action, by one user, could
expose critical information or create an entry
point for an adversary. An adversary could take
advantage of this to compromise aircraft, ships,
personnel, weapon systems and critical support
functions, and threaten Defence’s ability
to succeed across all warfighting domains.
The significance of these risks necessitates a
recalibration in how Defence approaches cyber
security across the workforce.

Defence’s approach to cyber workforce

management needs to meet current and future
needs. Traditional workforce management
techniques must be adapted, particularly given
the competition for cyber security talent.

Defence will explore new strategic partnership
arrangements with industry and allies that
allow Defence to tap into broader talent
pools in times of crisis. Defence will take
advantage of the unique elements of its cyber
security operating environment to attract and
retain talent. Innovative approaches to talent
management and professional development
will be explored to strengthen the workforce

###### OBJECTIVES

The objectives of the initial people actions are to:


pipeline and develop future leaders. These
activities will align with and contribute to the
_Cyber Security National Workforce Growth_
_Program, a joint initiative undertaken by_
Defence, the Department of Home Affairs,
industry and academia.

Every individual that interacts with Defence
networks and those within its supply chain must
also understand that they are a target and are
connected to the warfighting domain. Defence
will undertake a revitalised cyber security
cultural change program to ensure that every
individual understands that their behaviours
at work and when remotely connected, along
with their personal digital footprint, can impact
Defence’s cyber security and create risks for
the individual, and their family and friends. The
cultural change program will be supported by
a strong Defence-wide cyber security training
program designed to equip personnel with the
skills they need to be cyber secure. Defence’s
senior leadership will continue to play a critical
role, reinforcing a cyber secure culture across
the enterprise and promoting the direct role
that every individual plays in Defence’s overall
cyber security.



- define and meet Defence’s current and future cyber security workforce requirements;

- build awareness of cyber security threats and individual accountabilities, and uplift cyber security capability

across the Defence workforce;

- increase the ability of decision-makers to incorporate cyber risks into their risk management practices; and

- explore innovative approaches to talent management and professional development to attract and retain

personnel, and build future cyber leaders.

### FUTURE READY

The strategic environment is constantly

evolving, particularly in relation to cyberspace.
Sophisticated cyber actors are rapidly adapting
their tactics and developing new capabilities
and Defence must keep pace to ensure it can
effectively engage in future warfare and fulfil its
mission to defend Australia.

Defence has the challenge of implementing
and securing a significant and diverse array of
new and sophisticated business systems and
warfighting capabilities. The compromise of any
one system or capability could result in strategic
advantage for an adversary.

To match the rapidly evolving cyber threat
environment, Defence must be able to quickly
adapt to, and employ emerging security
approaches. Innovative approaches to security,
not only at the technical level, but those that
apply to governance models, policies and
workforce practices must be considered to
enable Defence to protect critical systems and
defend against malicious activity. To achieve
this, Defence will identify immediate cyber
security investments necessary to ensure it
is at the cutting edge of cyber security. These
investments will seek to not only enhance
Defence’s cyber resilience, but ensure

interoperability with existing capabilities while
minimising capability duplication across the
Defence portfolio. Defence will continue to

###### OBJECTIVES

The objectives of the initial future ready actions are to:


collaborate with allies to inform investments,
align capabilities and build our collective cyber
security.

While maintaining and strengthening its
current systems and capabilities, Defence
must have one foot firmly planted in the
future to ensure it maintains technological
pace with its adversaries. Based on threat
intelligence, Defence will strengthen its longer
term research and development programs
to ensure it has the strategic cyber security
capabilities necessary to combat future threats.
Research and development will be targeted at
those capabilities most likely to provide force
multiplication effects, including automation and
artificial intelligence, in preparation for a more
severe cyber threat environment.

However, research and development alone is
not sufficient. Defence must ensure it is able to
industrialise and operationalise these research
outcomes from concept to capability. Ideally, this
needs to be achieved in a sovereign ecosystem
to deliver strategic advantage and grow the
domestic cyber security market. Defence cannot
achieve this in isolation, and will leverage
strategic partnerships with industry, small to
medium enterprises, academia, think tanks,
allies and international partners to develop a
capability realisation pathway for the future.



- identify and address existing and future gaps in Defence’s cyber security capability;

- amplify the capability of Defence’s cyber security workforce through strategic investment in new and emerging

technologies;

- continue to align investment in new cyber security capabilities, and research and development activities with

allies to ensure Defence’s investment in cyber security achieves maximum impact; and

- leverage strategic partnerships with industry, small to medium enterprises, academia, think tanks and

international partners to fully harness research and development opportunities.


-----

### WHERE TO FROM HERE?

This Strategy is designed to deliver on the objectives of the _Defence_
_Transformation Strategy. It will contribute to a high-performing_
One Defence enterprise with the ability to continuously improve and
adapt to changing strategic circumstances.

A robust cyber security apparatus will be a key determinant in the
success of Defence’s mission, now and into the future. Accordingly,
this Strategy provides a flexible, principles-based approach to ensure
Defence is well-positioned to meet future cyber security challenges
over the next ten years.

But this cannot be achieved by Defence alone. Industry plays a critical
role in the provision of capabilities and personnel on which Defence
relies. Accordingly, Defence and industry must work hand-in-hand
to ensure strong cyber security across the Defence ecosystem, and
ultimately the success of Defence’s warfighting mission.

Defence’s approach to cyber security will require ongoing recalibration
in the face of an evolving cyber threat environment and rapid
technological advancements. This Strategy will continue to be reviewed
on an annual basis to ensure currency and to maintain the security of
Defence’s warfighting capability.
