#### OPENING STATEMENT BY THE MINISTER OF DEFENCE OF UKRAINE

2018 was a difficult and tense year for the Ministry of Defence of Ukraine and the
Armed Forces of Ukraine. We have carried out defence reform measures under the
conditions of ongoing hybrid aggression led by the Russian Federation. The Kremlin,
disregarding international law, has continued to intensify political and military pressure
on our Country in order to break the course towards European integration and return
Ukraine to its sphere of influence.

The increase of the Russian military capabilities along the state border with
Ukraine and the militarization of the illegally annexed Crimean Peninsula have became
unprecedented. During the open armed aggression, soldiers and ships of the Naval
Forces of the Armed Forces of Ukraine were captured in the Black Sea in the fall of 2018.

Under such conditions, Ukraine and its Armed Forces, with partner countries support,
have continued to provide a worthy repel to the aggressor, confidently advancing along
the road of reforms, the Euro-Atlantic principles and standards implementation.

Last July, the important for further reforms law of Ukraine "On National Security of
Ukraine", which enshrined the transformation of the Armed Forces of Ukraine according
to NATO standards and the irreversible changes in the security and defence sector of
Ukraine, came into effect.

The strategic scale of Russian threats to Ukraine’s national security has prompted
us to admit that an accelerated movement towards NATO membership meets the key
national interests. To implement these interests, changes to the Constitution were
made in 2018 and adopted in early 2019, which consolidated Ukraine’s Euro-Atlantic
aspirations.

The aggravation of the situation in the Azov-Black Sea region forced the state military
and political leadership to impose martial law in some regions of Ukraine at the end of
2018. It allowed, in addition to obtaining experience of state authority activity in crisis
conditions, to significantly increase the level of defence capability, to deploy the group
of troops (forces) in threatened areas, to concentrate the necessary supplies in certain
areas and to prepare the appropriate reserves.

The most significant achievements in 2018 should be seen as improving the
governance system and strengthening of democratic civilian control over the security
and defence sector. The Ministry of Defence has acquired the ability to formulate state
defence policy, and the General Staff – to ensure its effective implementation.

**WHITE BOOK**  **2018** **3**


-----

The development of a new defence planning system has continued. During the

year, the Capabilities catalog was updated and its functional groups were clarified. The
methodology for carrying out the capabilities assessment was tested.

The defence review preparations, aimed at definition of a forward-looking model

of the defence forces, taking into account the strategic assumption of Ukraine's future
membership of NATO, have been completed.

I want to emphasize that special attention was paid to the introduction of modern

software and project management in the defence resources management system.
Basing on the principles of advanced business practice as a pilot, 15 priority projects of
defence reform were launched.

Risk management has been introduced to neutralize the risks of making improper

management decisions and unacceptable losses during the process of using budget
funds.

Improved personnel policy ensured the Armed Forces manning of trained and

motivated personnel. The principles of gender equality are implemented through
legislative consolidation of equal rights and opportunities for women and men during
military service.

Last year, a large number of modern armaments and military equipment was

accepted for operational activity and put into service. Measures were assumed to
develop the production of missiles, artillery ammunition (mines), bullets for small arms,
automatic guns and grenade launchers at national enterprises of the defence complex.

A new system concerning weapons, military equipment and other material resources

procurement, in particular imports from foreign partners, has started. A three-year cycle
of weapons, military equipment and other material resources procurement planning
and modernization within the framework of the state defence order is being introduced.

New steps have been taken in social policy implementation. Military infrastructure

is improved and adequate conditions of the enlisted military personnel placement are
created. The level of personnel motivation to military service has risen, including and
due to the increase of military personnel salaries.

It allowed us:

To continue the successful deterrence against Russian aggression in the East of our

Country;

To increase the combat capability level, operational capabilities of the Armed Forces

of Ukraine and to improve their technical equipment and security;

To keep hold of military specialists with military experience in military service;

To ensure implementation of the course towards European and Euro-Atlantic

integration;

To put in action the planning and program documents that are necessary to complete

the defence reform.

The tasks in 2019-2020 are more ambitious and complex, which will require a

doubling of political determination and triple efficiency in the implementation of
practical measures.

I kindly hope that the combination of national capabilities and international

assistance will provide us with the necessary resources for it.

I believe in the inexhaustibility of our desire for transformation and victory, our

dedication to the service for the good of the Country.

Glory to Ukraine!

other resources


###### The main efforts of internal audit in 2018 were aimed at developing the competencies of internal auditors, distinguishing internal audit from internal control and risk management, as well as implementing the recommendations of international experts on improving internal audit.

Conducting audits of risk areas and monitoring the measures taken


Due to the improvement of risk-oriented planning, the number of unscheduled audits and other control measures

in 2018 compared to 2017 decreased by almost 10%, which made it possible to use the
limited resources of the Internal Audit Service effectively.


In the course of the 2018 on-site audits, 65.4 million UAH were prevented of


loss of resources, and internal control measures introduced by internal auditors
recommendations provided additional revenues and saving of expenses for the amount
of UAH 31.3 million.

The implementation of the Internal Control Standards in the Ministry of Defense and


the Armed Forces as of 01.01.2017 contributed to raising the responsibility of managers
at all levels for eliminating violations and risks identified. During 2018, almost UAH
172.6 million was refunded, violations and consequences of ineffective management
decisions were eliminated by almost UAH 1.9 billion.

According to the results of audits conducted in 2018, 2 585 persons were brought


to material and disciplinary responsibility. Case materials on losses in the amount of
417.3 million UAH were sent for trial to law enforcement agencies (Table 1.2).

was reviewed.

The evaluation results showed that, according to 30 criteria, the internal audit of
the Ministry of Defence fully complies with international standards and 20 more ones
partially.

The next review, conducted in November 2018, has witnessed the successful
implementation of another 11 recommendations; for the 2017-2018 60% of the
recommendations were implemented, the other ones are planned to be implemented

The main results achieved by the Armed Forces during the operation of the Joint Force in 2018


###### FO


The armed formations of Russian occupation troops with the support of the regular forces of the Russian Armed

Forces during 2018 continued activities aimed at destabilizing the internal social and
political situation in the temporarily occupied territory of Donetsk and Luhansk regions,
intimidating the local population and depriving them of the right to express their will.


The main efforts of the enemy focused on supporting the armed conflict in the

East of Ukraine by increasing military capabilities and provocative actions against the
Joint Forces, the active bombardment of their positions and adherence to the "war
on exhaustion" tactics, including the use of heavy weapons prohibited by the Minsk


agreements.

Despite the economic losses from sanctions, resource expenses for the maintenance


of the occupied territories and condemnation of aggressive actions by the world
community, the Russian Federation does not refuse its ambitious plans to return Ukraine
to its sphere of interests and continues to conduct undeclared war by the operational
grouping of the Russian-occupying forces.

REFORM RESULTS OF UKRAINE’s ARMED FORCES IN 2018

###### In 2018, the regulatory framework for ensuring the functioning of strategic communications in the structures of the Ministry of Defense and the Armed Forces was improved, and the number of public relations bodies has expanded, which filled the information space with timely and relevant information on the Armed Forces.

The organizational and staff structure of the Center for Strategic Communications of
the Main Defense Forces Command Point has been developed, and its integration into
the process of planning, coordination and performance of the tasks has been tested
during the strategic command-staff training "Cossack Will-2018".

In addition, standards were worked out on measures to ensure national security and
defense, repression and deterrence of armed aggression of the Russian Federation in
Donetsk and Luhansk oblasts.

During the year, a number of international cooperation activities, exchange of
experience and raising the professional level of profile specialists were carried out.


###### During the pilot project, a visit of the NATO Strategic Communications Team to the areas of combat missions, in particular to Avdiivka was held, which has allowed the expansion of the study of the Ukrainian experience in combating hybrid warfare. A photobook project was launched on events in the East of Ukraine to enhance public awareness and the international community "War. No comment "and" World we defend ".


During 2018, the strategic communications system was successfully integrated into
the structure of the Ministry of Defense and the Armed Forces, thus synchronizing the
efforts of all the components of strategic communications: public diplomacy, public
relations, military relations, information and psychological operations, cyber security
and other activities, aimed at promoting the goals of the state.

Maintaining this course in 2019 will contribute to building the capabilities
of the Ministry of Defense and the Armed Forces as part of a national and
interdepartmental strategic communications system aimed at supporting, shaping
and implementing Ukraine's security and defense policy, as well as achieving the
goals of state defense.

**The Ukrainian Army will continue to perform its tasks of regulating and stabilizing the situation in Donbass,**
**ensuring the containment and prevention of armed aggression on the part of the Russian Federation, the**

#### DEVELOPMENT OF THE ARMED FORCES MANAGEMENT SYSTEM, ITS STRUCTURE AND QUANTITY

Its difficult to
lead when you do it
consciously. uring 2018, the Armed Forces management system has operated in a special period,

conditioned by the operation of the Joint Forces and the implementation of the
_Napoleon Bonaparte І_ military legal regime in certain regions.

## [D]

The main task of the Armed Forces in this sphere was to ensure the reliable, stable
and continuous management of the troops (forces) at the permanent deployment sites
and in the area of the Joint Forces Operation.

###### IMPROVEMENT OF THE ARMED FORCES MANAGEMENT SYSTEM

In 2018, the implementation of the principles and approaches of Alliance member states in the military management
bodies’ activities, as well as the optimization and transition to the structures of NATO
headquarters continued. At the same time, the system of communication improved and
the technical components were re-equipped. The development of automated command
and control systems continued.

For the planned implementation of the Strategic Defense Bulletin of Ukraine
norms and the State Program for the Development of the Armed Forces of Ukraine
until 2020, the reform and development of the Armed Forces management system
and the strengthening of the capabilities of the military administration bodies have
continued.

The main efforts focused on the following activities:

                - Optimization of the control system components in the area of the

                - anti-terrorist operation, and, upon its completion, the Joint Forces Operation in
the Donetsk and Luhansk regions;

                - The transfer of military management bodies to structures of type J, G, S (with
functions of NATO staff);

               - Re-equipment of the communication systems mobile and stationary components
to the digital platform;

               - Improvement of the information security and cybernetic security of the Armed
Forces system;

               - Development of the automated command and control systems.

During the reformation of anti-terrorist operations for the Joint Force, a change in
the basic principles of the troops (forces) application took place, which directly affected
the need to change the principles of the Armed Forces Command in the East of Ukraine
operation.

The transition to a new format of the operation made possible, without changing
the operative construction of the troops (forces), the implementation of a defence
operation in the direction of an enemy possible major blow in the case of a large-scale
aggression on the part of the Russian Federation against Ukraine.

###### RESULTS OF THE ARMED FORCES’ TRAINING

The presence of real and powerful external threats and risks caused by the main trends in the development of
the military-strategic environment around Ukraine became the prime factors for
determining the priorities of the Armed Forces training in 2018.


The practice of the Armed Forces inter-service and inter-agency training principles
was developed during the year. The issues of integrated use of land, air and naval
components, all branches and other defence forces components were worked out in
the course of training based on gained combat experience.

The main efforts were focused on coordination of Command and Control agencies,
military units and detachments, improvement of flying skills of flight crews, and an
increase of the level of personnel training.

###### The training of designated military units and detachments from the Joint Forces group was characterized by the refinement of the algorithm for the restoration of their combat capability. The same period of 6 months for participation in combat actions and recreation was introduced for everyone. The intensive training can last up to six months.

Advanced training technologies, including distance learning, innovative educational equipment and modern
simulators continued to be introduced to the individual training of Service personnel.
The practical experience of military specialists training in the NATO member states
armies was introduced in the multi-level system of training for NCOs and basic combined
arms training. The practice of using simulation modelling centres and JCATS software
has been extended as part of the centralized personnel training at brigades (battalions)
headquarters’ staff training courses1 . The priority was given to the rehearsal of planning
procedures for combat operations, movement, manoeuvre and control of subordinate
military units and detachments when performing the assigned tasks.

A basic combined arms training course was introduced in the Armed Forces training
centres based on the experience of the NATO member states. The introduction of the
BArS Battle Army System has been launched. The system is based on live battlefield
combat training. Further development of specialist schools was ensured. Three schools
for specialist training were established in the following specialities: tank operators, antitank missile system specialists and combined arms training.


1 The centralized personnel training is carried out on the basis of the National Defence University of Ukraine and higher military educational institutions
involving faculty staff with practical combat experience.

###### The formation and development of leadership skills for theatre-level commanders was paid special attention in individual training as they contribute to the professional training of future commanders and command skills training. A Leaders' Reaction Course (LRC) was established in the NCOs Training Centre of Land Forces for this purpose. A leadership course was introduced in the cadets’ training system of higher military educational institutions which provide future officers with the possibility to acquire the knowledge and skills required to command military personnel. An experiment was launched on specialists training from among civilian youth in the Leadership School.


Staff exercises on planning and use of units have been held for the first time with
cadets of the Petro Sahaidachnyi National Land Forces Academy (specialities mechanized
(tank) and engineering troops) according to NATO procedures and standards.

Practical processes of Euro-Atlantic integration disseminating in the Armed Forces
were applied to improve individual training of service personnel, military authorities
training and training of military units and detachments.

The instructors training system is being actively incorporated in the Armed Forces
and runs in 7 training centres. Foreign instructors from the United States, Great Britain,
Canada, Denmark, Poland and Lithuania provided assistance to the Ukrainian specialists
at such centres. Personnel training courses led by the instructors of ORBITAL, JMTG-U
and UNIFIER training missions have proved to be highly efficient.

Improving Legal Framework on Military Service in 2018


A number of normative legal acts, other documents on the military service of citizens of Ukraine and the Armed

Forces manning system during 2018 were developed and issued, which allowed:



- to increase the age limit of Ukrainian citizens for admission to higher military

educational institutions from 23 to 30 years of age, which allowed the service
members involved in the Joint Forces Operation (JFO) and the Anti-Terrorist
Operation (ATO) to be enrolled for further military service at the officer (noncommissioned officer) positions;



- to increase the mobilization resource and ensure gender equality through raising

the age limit for women to remain in reserve for up to 60 years as it has been set

3 to 5 years for soldiers and sergeants and from 5 to 10 years for officers), which
contributed to an increase in the number of citizens who wish to serve under a
short-term contract;



- the service members to be released or sign a new contract if the validity of their

contracts has been forcibly extended during the special period, as well as those
service members who signed the contract before the end of the special period

###### MORAL AND PSYCHOLOGICAL SUPPORT OF THE ARMED FORCES OF UKRAINE


In modern conditions, when the national security of Ukraine is affected by multiple new military threats, the moral
and psychological resilience and readiness of the Armed Forces military personnel
to perform assigned tasks plays a decisive role. This was particularly evident in the
process of repelling and deterring Russian aggression in the Donetsk and Luhansk
oblasts, where in line with the conventional armed warfare, the Russian Federation
actively employed the entire spectrum of negative informational and psychological
influence.

In order to neutralize and minimize this influence in 2018, a priority was given to the
issues of formation, support and restoration of moral and psychological conditions of
personnel, as well as establishment of a uniform conceptual framework and approaches
for the tasks, activities and procedures aimed at organizing and improving the moral and
psychological support system.


Establishing and Strengthening the National Identity of the Military Personnel

The main efforts in 2018 for organization and provision of the military-patriotic and cultural activity were directed
towards military personnel national identity strengthening through creation of
conditions as to change mentality of the Armed Forces personnel on the basis of the
national and European values.

developed, defining priorities for military authorities, military units, entities and defence
institutions to disavow the communist past of Ukraine, while simultaneously restoring
and introducing new national combat traditions:

the system of the military-patriotic work with military personnel. This was facilitated
by the amendments to the certain Laws, establishing the new salutation “Glory to
Ukraine!” - Glory to the Heroes!”. This salutation was first used in the Army of UNR

national liberation struggle of the Ukrainian people. The new address “Pan (Pani)” has
been established in military regulations, being the crucial step for the introduction of
the new culture of relations between military personnel, founded on the national values
and general European culture.

Implementation of the provisions of the Law of Ukraine "On Amendments to Certain
Laws of Ukraine on Ensuring Equal Rights and Opportunities of Women and Men
during Military Service in the Armed Forces of Ukraine and Other Military Formations”
that entered into force on October 27, 2018 and is aimed at protecting the rights of
women to serve based on the same foundation as men (except in the cases envisaged
by the legislation on protection of mother and child welfare, as well as prohibition of
discrimination on the grounds of sex) will facilitate further extension of the range of
opportunities for women and decrease the gender gap in the forces.

Gender aspects have been taken into account in the military personnel education
and training system, in particular in the curriculum for humanitarian disciplines in higher
military education establishments. A pilot project on the unified approach to education
integrating the gender aspect is being implemented in the Military Institute of Taras
Shevchenko National University of Kyiv and Ivan Chernyakhovsky National Defence
University of Ukraine.

Moreover, starting in 2019 women are allowed to enter the military lyceums, in
particular, in 2019 the first female class will be admitted to Ivan Bohun Kyiv Military
Lyceum.


###### The number of servicewomen admitted to higher military educational institutions and military training formations of higher educational institutions accounts for around 8% of the overall number of admitted personnel.


During the celebration of the 27th anniversary of the Independence of Ukraine
a joint formation of female soldiers has marched in the military parade through the
Maidan Nezalezhnosti (the Independence Square) for the first time in history, confidently
demonstrating their marching drill skills.

_have been appointed in 2018);_



- The information in “Gender Issues in the Security Sector” section of the official

website of the Ministry of Defence is constantly updated;



- Lists of military occupation specialties and organic positions for enlisted and

NCOs personnel, as well as the wage rate scale for these positions have been put
in place[12]. All military occupation specialties for enlisted and NCOs personnel,
including “combat” positions, became available to female soldiers.



- Gender-related competence of personnel was increased at various workshops,

trainings and “round tables”, such as: “Essence and stages of gender-oriented
budgeting”, “Gender for press officers”, “On improving the mechanism of legal
gender expertise”;



- The book “Zhana’s Prophecy” dedicated to women who took part in the ATO/JFO

in the East of Ukraine, was published in the framework of the project “History of
Ukrainian Warriors”;



- Anonymous surveys regarding gender-based violence, manifestations of gender
based discrimination and abidance by the legislation requirements in the
appointment of women to higher military positions considering their professional
competency have been carried out;



- Military mass media have started to cover gender-related topics;

- Conditions, suitable for conducting briefings and giving mass media interviews,


have been created.

Assistance of International Partners (Organizations) in the Implementation of Gender Aspects
in the Armed Forces of Ukraine


Representatives of international organizations such as the UN, OSCE and NATO are reliable partners in the

integration of the gender policy in the Armed Forces as they provide comprehensive
support enabling the UAF to meet global standards of gender equality, facilitate the
reinforcement of gender factors in the activities of the Ministry of Defence, and
advocate for the participation of female soldiers in the peace and security operations
as a part of national contingents and personnel.


Multiple meetings, conferences, workshops, trainings and consultations discussing


the issues of implementation of the state gender policy in the activities of the forces
have been organized and carried out in cooperation with the representatives of the
international organizations.

International organizations experts studied the gender impact and monitored


gender-sensitive issues in the activities of the Armed Forces and used obtained results
to develop manuals and recommendations later distributed amongst various units of
the Ministry of Defence, the General Staff, military command and control agencies
and the troops to be used in their daily service activities when making managerial and
personnel-related decisions, namely:

12 The Order of the Ministry of Defence of Ukraine “On Approval of the Lists of Military Occupational Specialties and Organic Positions for Enlisted and NCO

Personnel, as well as the Wage Rate Scales for the Aforementioned Service Personnel” No. 627 as of December 13, 2018 (registered in the Ministry of

An updated Partnership Goal G0013 “Gender perspectives” has been added to the
list for implementation in the framework of NATO-Ukraine partnership at the initiative
of the Alliance representatives. This goal is aimed at fulfilling the main provisions of the
National Action Plan for the Implementation of UN Security Council Resolution 1325 –
Women, Peace and Security until 2020[13].

Integration of the gender component in the functioning and development of the
Armed Forces will facilitate the increased efficiency of their activities. Large number
of missions and tasks carried out by female soldiers, including in the JFO area on
administrative and combat positions indicates relevance of gender equality as a
significant multiplier of defence capabilities in Ukraine.

Further active engagement of females in the military field creates new opportunities
for them, which is one of the conditions for our state’s accession with the European
and Euro-Atlantic society, and allows to use existent human resources with maximal
efficiency.

###### ENSURING SOCIAL GUARANTEES TO SERVICE PERSONNEL AND THEIR FAMILIES


Professionalization of the Armed Forces is closely related to ensuring the competitive ability of military service
on the job market. This requires ensuring social guarantees to service personnel and
their families including monetary allowance and other types of support in an amount
corresponding to the conditions of military service and allowing to preserve qualified
military cadre and to recruit educated and committed youth. The State can expect and
has the right to demand the effective performance of the assigned duties from service
personnel only provided that the envisaged social guarantees are ensured.

Monetary Allowance


In 2018 the expenditures from the Cash Fund amounted to UAH 34.8 billion, (14,8% more than in 2017), which in
turn allowed to increase the amount of the monetary allowance of service personnel
by an average of 10% compared to 2017 (Diagram 6.5).

The main principle of the new food service system is that nutrition of service
personnel is organized according to the Food Catalogue based not on the established
norms, but rather on the price and calorie value within the limits of the maximum price
and minimum daily calorie requirements per service personnel (3000 - 6000 kcal).

The Food Catalogue is an assortment of food items selected to feed the troops,
where each food item has a specific price and calorie value per unit (determined by the
bidding process). A key role here is played by the requirement regarding the price and
caloric content that must not be any less than indicated in the Food Catalogue.

Implementation of the new food service system has led to the following positive
changes in terms of extending the rations of the service personnel:



  - 40% increase of the meat category (ensured the nutritional efficiency of the
_finished meal, rational use of storage facilities and improved the taste quality_
_of the dishes);_

  - 11% increase of the vegetable-grain category (18 articles added: steamed long_grain rice, polished rice, fresh eggplant, fresh summer squash, cauliflower, bell_
_pepper, salad, fresh tomato, spring onions, parsley, dill, garlic, fresh champignon_
_mushroom);_

  - Increase in the specific weight of rice and buckwheat (78%) in relation to other
grains (22%).

Service personnel are additionally supplied with fresh seasonal fruits, fermented
dairy products, juices and beverages, confectionery and baked goods, spices and
condiments.

Effectiveness and practicality of the new food service system have been proven in
practice, as the system has received a lot of positive feedback from its final consumer service personnel of the Armed Forces.

###### PEACEKEEPING


Ukraine’s contribution to peacekeeping continued to be an important part of the country's contribution to the
consolidation of peace and security throughout the world. In 2018 the main efforts
in peacekeeping activities were aimed at preserving the existing level of Ukraine’s
contribution to international missions and continuing the implementation of Ukraine’s
international commitments by attracting the minimum necessary amount of material
and financial resources.

###### Approximately 600 service personnel of the Armed Forces of Ukraine as a part of two national contingents and national personnel participated in 7 UN and NATO-led International Peace Support and Security Operations and participated in operations as a part of Joint Peacekeeping Forces on the territory of 5 countries in the Abyei Area.

The Ukrainian peacekeepers’ contribution was highly appreciated by the leadership
of international security organizations.

the decision of the President of Ukraine, 56th Separate Helicopter Wing and National
Personnel were returned to Ukraine in 2018.

In addition, in view of Slovak decision and in pursuance of the resolution of the
Security Council of Ukraine of January 30, 2018, No. 2398, two representatives of the

Slovak military contingent of the United Nations Peace and Security Forces in Cyprus in
September 2018.

During 2018, rotation of 4 national contingents and 39 people of national personnel

INTERNATIONAL COOPERATION OF THE MINISTRY OF DEFENSE AND THE ARMED FORCES

###### Ukraine continued the testing of inspections launched in 2014 in the new format in the East of the country, using mechanisms of the Vienna Document 2011 on measures to strengthen confidence and security. In 2018, 5 inspections were conducted.

Additional confidence and security measures in the framework of bilateral
intergovernmental agreements with neighbouring states (the Slovak Republic, the
Republic of Poland, the Republic of Belarus, Hungary and Romania) contributed to the
strengthening of regional security.

Their results have been officially disseminated among all OSCE participating States
and have become a practical basis for new effective mechanisms and instruments for
arms control and military activities in Europe nowadays.

The OSCE states have confirmed the full implementation of Ukraine's international
obligations and the transparency of military activities of the Armed Forces.

The results of verification activities of the Armed Forces contributed to strengthening
the position of our state in the negotiation process within the framework of leading
international organizations, in particular OSCE.

The mechanisms provided by international treaties and agreements promoted the
dissemination of truthful information on the politico-military situation in our country
and the activities of the Armed Forces of Ukraine, other military formations and law
enforcement agencies of Ukraine.

In 2018 OSCE states and the international community had an opportunity to assure of
the transparency of military activities and Ukraine's commitment to peaceful settlement
of the ongoing crisis.

Additional confidence and security measures in the border areas within the
framework of bilateral intergovernmental agreements with neighbouring states have
confirmed their effectiveness in strengthening regional security.
