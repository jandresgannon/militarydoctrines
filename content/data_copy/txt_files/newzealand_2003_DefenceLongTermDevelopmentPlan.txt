### 1 INTRODUCTION

1.1 First released on 11 June 2002, the Long-Term Development Plan (LTDP) is a
planning tool to enable decisions on defence acquisitions to be taken in the context
of the Government’s defence policy, the priority of projects and affordability. The
LTDP links the Government’s defence policy objectives, which were set out in the
Defence Policy Framework released in June 2000, with the capability requirements
announced in the Defence Statement of 8 May 2001. This LTDP contains a
comprehensive list of projects, with preliminary costing, timings, and priorities. The
LTDP has a rolling forward focus of 10 years and was constructed as an active
document, to be updated regularly. This is the first updated version of the LTDP.

1.2 The LTDP:

a. describes major acquisition projects required over the next 10 years to
provide military capabilities that meet the Government’s defence policy
objectives;

b. reflects relative priorities of the projects, measured against the Government’s
defence policy and security needs and interests;

c. works within agreed financial limitations; and

d. sets out planning and decision-making processes incorporating management
of both operational and financial risks to ensure that investment in defence
provides best value for money.

**Funding Parameters**

1.3 The LTDP will be managed within approved financial parameters. These are:

a. up to $1 billion, in nominal terms, in capital injections over the next 10 years;

b. any inflationary pressure to be managed within these constraints until
2005/06; and

c. leasing options may be considered where there is a neutral trade-off between
capital and operating expenditure.

**Project Summary Sheets**

1.4 A project summary sheet for each project on the LTDP can be found in
sections 5 to 9. Each summary sheet describes the project, how it contributes to the
Government’s defence policy, links to other capabilities, timing issues, costs and
possible options where these are known. Options and trade-offs for defence
acquisitions will be properly investigated, costed and presented to Ministers as
projects are brought forward for approval.


-----

### 2 THE LONG-TERM DEVELOPMENT PLAN AND DEFENCE POLICY

2.1 The LTDP sets out the defence acquisition projects that will enable the NZDF
to implement the Government’s defence policy.

2.2 In its 8 May 2001 Defence Statement, the Government stated that it:

is building a modern, professional and well-equipped Defence Force with
the necessary military capabilities across all three services to meet New
Zealand's objectives… the New Zealand Defence Force is being
reconfigured so that it is sustainable and affordable over the long-term. It
will be able both to meet New Zealand's own defence and security needs,
and to make a useful contribution when it is deployed.[1]

2.3 The Government’s defence policy objectives are:

- to defend New Zealand and to protect its people, land, territorial waters, EEZ,
natural resources and critical infrastructure;

- to meet our alliance commitments to Australia by maintaining a close defence
partnership in pursuit of common security interests;

- to assist in the maintenance of security in the South Pacific and to provide
assistance to our Pacific neighbours;

- to play an appropriate role in the maintenance of security in the Asia-Pacific
region, including meeting our obligations as a member of the FPDA; and

- to contribute to global security and peacekeeping through participation in the full
range of UN and other appropriate multilateral peace support and humanitarian
relief operations.[2]

**Prioritising the LTDP**

2.4 The LTDP prioritisation will be reviewed regularly to ensure continuity with
defence policy and strategic circumstances. In this updated version, a number of
projects in the category of ‘Necessary to Avoid the Failure of Policy’ have been
approved by the Government. They have consequently shifted into the category of
‘Projects Approved in Principle by Government’. Two projects from the category
‘Projects Necessary to Provide a Well-Equipped Land Force’, Direct Fire Support
Weapon – Area and Medium Range Anti-Armour Weapon, have also been approved
in principle by the Government. Two projects from the category ‘Projects Necessary
to Avoid Significant Risks to Policy’, Whenuapai runway and hardstanding
reconstruction, have been removed from the LTDP following the Government’s
decision to consolidate all Air Force operations at Ohakea. The Ohakea runway
project has been removed from the LTDP as this project has been approved and
construction is underway. No other projects have been reprioritised.

New Zealand’s Needs, p.2.

-----

2.5 The first step in the prioritisation process was a gap analysis. It identified
those areas where, over the next 10 years, a capability gap will impact on the
NZDF’s ability to meet the roles and tasks set out in the Defence Policy Framework
under each policy objective. This gap analysis demonstrated that acquisition projects
to meet the capability gaps fell into three broad categories:

a. Projects that are critical to avoiding failure to achieve policy objectives. The
projects consist of “enabling capabilities” that are necessary to facilitate
operational missions (for example, joint command and control system, airfield
infrastructure maintenance), and operational capabilities that are
fundamental to meet defence policy objectives.

b. Projects that are necessary to avoid significant policy risks. These projects
affect the degree to which policy objectives can be achieved and the manner
in which they are fulfilled.

c. Projects that carry a lower level of risk affecting the degree to which policy
objectives are met and the manner in which they are fulfilled.

2.6 The gap analysis considered the five defence policy objectives to be equally
important. A sensitivity analysis assessed the impact of weighting the importance of
each objective. It demonstrated that the projects within the top category remained
constant, and confirmed their importance to avoid policy failure.

2.7 As a further check, the list of high priority projects was compared with the
priorities set out in the Defence Policy Framework, which states that:

A capital investment programme will concentrate defence resources in a
range of affordable and sustainable military capabilities that contribute to
meeting our objectives. Priority will be given to the acquisition and
maintenance of essential equipment. Our core requirement is for wellequipped, combat trained land forces which are also able to act as
effective peacekeepers, supported by the Navy and Air Force.[3]

2.8 To be consistent with this statement, higher priority was accorded to a number
of projects that are necessary to provide well-equipped, combat trained land forces,
also able to act as effective peacekeepers.

2.9 Projects already approved in principle by the Government are treated in the
prioritisation as a separate category. Other considerations that affect the sequencing
of high priority projects were also taken into account. These include the projected
end-of-life of current equipment and the amount of pre-acquisition work that is
required.

### 3 FUNDING

**Funding Guidelines**

3.1 Following a review of the financial effects caused by revaluation of the NZDF’s
assets on the LTDP (CAB Min (03) 11/4), the Government directed financial
parameters are now:

a. up to $1 billion, in nominal terms, in capital injections over the next 10 years;

b. any inflationary pressure to be managed within these constraints until
2005/06; and

c. leasing options may be considered where there is a neutral trade-off between
capital and operating expenditure.

**Affordability, Options and Trade-Offs**

3.2 Funding constraints, cash flow management (both from depreciation and new
capital) and defence industry considerations will also affect priorities, timing and the
overall affordability of the LTDP. Trade-offs within and between projects are
necessary. The projects presented in the LTDP take into account the Government’s
existing funding parameters. Solutions have been developed to provide capabilities
within the financial parameters that are appropriate for New Zealand’s circumstances
and will deliver the Government’s policy. For most projects, however, present
costing information is not refined. It is acknowledged that in order to determine the
affordability of the LTDP, Defence needs to improve the individual costing data on
which the plan is based, on a project-by-project basis.

3.3 In order to provide more robust decision-making information the process by
which costing for acquisition projects is developed is being reviewed. A revised
costing review process will consider all elements of defence capital expenditure,
including acquisition costs, through-life costs and cost/risk mitigation. Life cycle
costing policy is being developed and through-life costs are being obtained for
projects currently at the acquisition phase. The full introduction of life cycle costing
into long-term development will take some time to be implemented. NZDF and
Treasury officials are continuing to work on strategies to minimise financial risks.

3.4 By changing levels of capability, cost and policy compliance it is possible to
identify options within projects. These options, which will be investigated for each
project, could include phasing projects to spread the cash flow or reducing the size
and/or scope of a project. Reducing the level of capability acquired could affect the
NZDF's ability to deliver outputs designed to achieve the Government’s policy
objectives.

**Financial Risks**

3.5 There are several financial risks associated with the LTDP that will have to be
managed to ensure the plan remains affordable.

a. Inflation. Estimated costs need to reflect inflation.


-----

b. Foreign Exchange Movements. The majority of the project costs included in
the revised LTDP have been converted from USD into NZD using exchange
rate projections advised by Treasury (below). Any change to these
projections will result in changes to project costs.

**FY 02/03** **FY 03/04** **FY 04/05 Onwards**

0.56 0.55 0.53

c. Upgrades. Military equipment requires regular upgrades to ensure that it is
able to provide the required capability. Upgrades are also important to keep
pace with technological changes and to maintain interoperability with other
defence forces. Known upgrades have been included in the LTDP. Other
unpredicted upgrades may be required during the life of the equipment.

d. Personnel and Operating Costs. Operating baseline changes will need to be
managed to take account of pay increases and changes in NZDF personnel
numbers, training requirements, maintenance and operating resulting from
new equipment.

**Projects Currently ‘Below the Funding Line’**

3.6 The LTDP contains those projects currently deemed necessary to deliver the
capability required by the Government, and which are being processed by the NZDF.
Given the current financial parameters, however, projects in the category of those
that have benefit but are less critical to achieving policy objectives are unlikely to be
funded. This underlines the importance of reviewing projects that are ‘above the line’
in order to realise potential savings. These projects will still require work to clarify
their scope, utility across the policy objectives and cost, and will be included in future
reviews of the LTDP. Changing strategic circumstances could result in
reprioritisation of projects.

### 4 MANAGING THE LTDP

4.1 Several processes have been developed to ensure that the LTDP will be a
core decision-making tool for the Government.

**Updating the LTDP**

4.2 It is important that the LTDP is updated regularly to provide the best
information possible to inform decisions on defence acquisitions and the budget
cycle. The following processes will, therefore, be a feature of managing the LTDP:

a. An updated LTDP and accompanying report from officials will be submitted to
Ministers to inform their considerations during the strategic phase of the
budget process.

b. The LTDP will be treated as a dynamic, evolutionary document and updated
on a regular basis as warranted by the availability of new and more accurate
information.

c. The LTDP will be updated whenever there is a significant change in the
Government’s financial circumstances, a change in policy, or to support the
financial impact of NZDF asset revaluations.

d. An updated LTDP will be made available whenever acquisition proposals are
submitted for government consideration and approval. This will permit
Ministers to consider each project within the overall context of total planned
acquisitions and with a clear view of priorities, risks and trade-offs.

4.3 It is also important that Ministers have confidence that projects are well
managed and that acquisition activity is consistent with the LTDP and government
direction. This has been achieved by the use of the following processes by the MoD
and the NZDF:

a. Government approval will be sought to proceed with acquisition activity for
each project.

b. The Minister of Defence will be consulted prior to commencing major project
definition studies.

c. The Minister of Defence will be consulted prior to documentation being made
available to commercial suppliers.

d. The Minister of Defence will be advised of the outcome of the evaluation of
the responses from commercial suppliers.

e. The Minister of Defence will be consulted prior to documentation being made
available to short-listed suppliers, and on the criteria to be used for
evaluating the responses.

f. The Minister of Defence will be advised of the outcome of the tender
evaluation, including an analysis of the ability of the equipment to be


-----

acquired to meet the capability, and on contract negotiations with the
preferred supplier(s).

g. On completion of the contract negotiations, Ministerial approval will be sought
to enter into contract with the preferred supplier(s) and for the appropriation
of funds.

**Capability Management Framework**

4.4 Defence is developing a Capability Management Framework setting out
governance arrangements and procedures to provide a robust and sustainable basis
for the NZDF/MoD to progress capability development and implementation. The
Framework will ensure that the projects on the LTDP are defined, costed and
presented to Ministers in a timely manner. The Framework will also allow HQ NZDF,
single Services, and the MoD to plan for, and allocate appropriate resources to,
those projects that have a higher priority on the LTDP.

### 5 PROJECTS APPROVED IN PRINCIPLE BY GOVERNMENT

#### Light Operational Vehicle (LOV)

**Description**

5.1 This project provides the Army and Special Forces with a modern, light
operational, military vehicle.

**Policy Value**

5.2 The LOV provides an essential capability to enable the Army and Special
Forces to train and to participate in operations in the South Pacific, Asia-Pacific
region and globally. LOVs are the primary means of transport used by the Army and
Special Forces in peacekeeping operations and also in peace enforcement
operations, including in support of the LAV. In addition, the LOVs may provide
support for evacuation operations in the South Pacific.

**Capability Gap**

5.3 The Army’s military mobility needs are currently met by the obsolete fleet of
Land Rovers. The Land Rovers have reached the end of their economic life.

**Links to other Capabilities**

5.4 This project has links to the following projects and capabilities:

- Light Armoured Vehicle

- Air transport

- Multi-Role Vessel

- Land Intelligence Surveillance Reconnaissance

- Medium Range Anti-Armour Weapon

- Direct Fire Support Weapon – (Area)

**Timing**

5.5 Acquisition needs to occur as soon as possible to ensure that the Army and
Special Forces can continue to meet the Government’s policy requirements.

**Current Status**

5.6 The Ministry of Defence has invited tenders for three LOV variants: armoured,
non-armoured military, and special operations. Evaluation of the Best and Final Offer
is nearing completion.

**Costs**

5.7 This project is expected to cost $60 million - $110 million.


-----

#### Multi-Role Vessel 

**Description**

5.8 This project involves the purchase of a Multi-Role Vessel (MRV) to provide
tactical sealift for the NZDF, to support disaster relief and peace support operations,
to conduct resource protection patrols, to provide diplomatic/military presence, and
for training. The vessel will replace HMNZS Canterbury.

**Policy Value**

5.9 The MRV would be used in the South Pacific and Asia-Pacific region for
contributing to peace support operations, evacuations of personnel during civil
emergencies, and disaster relief. A tactical sealift capability, to off-load people and
equipment without access to a port facility, will be particularly useful in meeting the
Government’s policy objectives in the South Pacific. The MRV will also be able to
undertake patrol and presence operations in New Zealand's EEZ and the South
Pacific, and provide the Government with an additional option for global deployments
(or allow the ANZAC frigates to be deployed for global tasks). The MRV will provide
additional berths for sea training purposes.

**Capability Gap**

5.10 The NZDF has no tactical sealift capability and cannot easily deploy land force
personnel and equipment into areas without port facilities. Tactical sealift vessels
cannot be chartered. Without a MRV New Zealand will continue to rely on the
tactical sealift capabilities of our allies and friends in the region for deploying to peace
support operations and evacuating our nationals from trouble spots.

5.11 The MRV, in conjunction with the frigates and the offshore patrol vessels, will
provide additional capacity for tasks such as presence, support to land operations,
patrol and disaster relief, and for training.

**Links to Other Capabilities**

5.12 This project has links to the following projects and capabilities:

- Light Armoured Vehicle

- Light Operational Vehicle

- Patrol Vessels

- NZDF Helicopter Capability

- P-3 Mission Systems Upgrade

**Timing**

5.13 It is intended that the MRV will be brought into service to replace Canterbury
when she is retired in 2005.


-----

**Current Status**

5.14 The Ministry of Defence, in consultation with the NZDF and other departments
and agencies as appropriate, has developed functional descriptions of the
capabilities required for the MRV as the basis of tender documents. The Request for
Proposals, including functional and performance specifications, was issued to the six
short-listed companies in May 2003. Responses are due in late October 2003.

**Costs**

5.15 The total cost of the MRV and patrol vessels is not to exceed $500 million.
The cost of the MRV is capped at US$100 million.


-----

#### Patrol Vessels

**Description**

5.16 This project proposes the acquisition of patrol capabilities to meet inshore and
offshore requirements for maritime surface surveillance in New Zealand's EEZ and
the South Pacific.

**Policy Value**

5.17 Patrol vessels are an important element in the surveillance of New Zealand's
EEZ and other maritime areas of interest. They work in conjunction with maritime
patrol aircraft to protect our natural resources and detect and deter maritime
transnational threats. Patrol vessels will meet many government agencies’ needs,
including the Ministry of Fisheries, the New Zealand Customs Service, the
Department of Conservation, the Police, the Maritime Safety Authority and others.
Offshore patrol vessels will also be able to support maritime counter-terrorism, and
provide a presence in the South Pacific to support peace and stability and help with
disaster relief.

**Capability Gap**

5.18 New Zealand currently has a very limited maritime surface patrol capability,
provided by three frigates (and by 2005, two ANZAC class frigates). The largest gap
is in New Zealand's ability to patrol the inshore zone around New Zealand where the
majority of civilian patrol requirements – primarily Ministry of Fisheries and Customs
– are situated. There is also very limited capacity to undertake counter-terrorism
operations at sea.

**Links to other Capabilities**

5.19 This project has links to the following projects and capabilities:

- Multi-Role Vessel

- P-3 Mission Systems Upgrade

- NZDF Helicopter Capability

- Special Operations Capabilities

**Timing**

5.20 The introduction into service of the patrol vessels will depend upon a number
of factors. These include: the Navy’s ability to crew new vessels, the length of time
required to design and build new vessels, and capital and operating funding
constraints.

**Current Status**

5.21 The Ministry of Defence, in consultation with the NZDF and other departments
and agencies as appropriate, has developed functional descriptions of the
capabilities required for the patrol vessels as the basis of tender documents. The
Request for Proposals, including functional and performance specifications, was


-----

issued to the six short-listed companies in May 2003. Responses are due in late
October 2003.

**Costs**

5.22 The total cost of the MRV and patrol vessels is not to exceed $500 million.

**Possible Options**

5.23 Final decisions on the fleet composition will not be made until proposals from
industry have been evaluated.


-----

### P-3 Mission Systems Upgrade

**Description**

5.24 This project proposes to upgrade the sensors and mission management
systems required for the P-3 Orion maritime patrol aircraft to conduct surface
surveillance tasks.

**Policy Value**

5.25 The capability provided by the P-3 is central to meeting a broad range of
civilian roles and tasks and for many functions required of the NZDF across the
range of the Government’s five defence policy objectives. The P-3 undertakes
surveillance of New Zealand’s EEZ and the Southern Ocean, meets our South
Pacific search and rescue obligations, and provides surveillance assistance to Pacific
Island countries. The P-3 has a high utility for a wide range of civilian and military
operations. It is one of the primary force elements contributing to our defence
relationships with Australia and Five Power Defence Arrangement (FPDA) partners.

**Capability Gap**

5.26 The obsolescent mission systems onboard the P-3 are limiting availability for
surveillance flights and other missions due to repeated equipment failures. Without
an upgrade, the Government may be faced with policy failure in meeting its
objectives for EEZ and Southern Ocean surveillance and assisting South Pacific
countries with surveillance of their EEZs. The Government would also have difficulty
meeting commitments to Australia and the FPDA.

**Associated Projects**

5.27 The P-3 communications and navigation systems also need to be upgraded to
address equipment obsolescence, meet operational requirements, and comply with
evolving international air traffic regulations. The communications and navigation
upgrade requirements are covered in a separate project.

5.28 The P-3 also lacks self-protection capability against man-portable, infrared
missiles. This deficiency is also addressed in a separate project.

**Links to other Capabilities**

5.29 This project has links to the following projects and capabilities:

- Patrol Vessels

- Multi-Role Vessel

- Land Intelligence Surveillance Reconnaissance

- Joint Command and Control System

- NZDF Torpedo Replacement

- Anti-Ship Missile

- P-3/C-130 Self-Protection

- P-3 Communications and Navigation Systems Upgrade

- ANZAC frigates


-----

**Timing**

5.30 The tender and evaluation process will be conducted through 2003 with the
intention of signing a contract by mid 2004. The first mission capable aircraft is
expected to be in service in 2006, with fleet modernisation complete in 2008/9.

**Current Status**

5.31 On 9 December 2002 Cabinet noted the options for upgrading both the P-3
mission systems and communications and navigation systems, and authorised the
Ministry of Defence to seek proposals from industry. The Request for Tender will be
released in June 2003 to the four short-listed companies with responses due in
October 2003.

**Costs**

5.32 This project is expected to cost $150 million - $220 million depending on the
extent of the upgrade.


-----

#### C-130 Life Extension

**Description**

5.33 This project proposes to extend the life of the C-130 aircraft by upgrading the
avionics and aircraft systems and undertaking some structural refurbishment work.

**Policy Value**

5.34 The C-130 is a critical enabler for many NZDF operations. It provides essential
air transport for the deployment of NZDF personnel and equipment, within New
Zealand, to the South Pacific, Australia, the Asia-Pacific region and globally. Air
transport is a critical capability for a number of roles and tasks, including: supporting
counter-terrorist operations; peace support operations; evacuations of New
Zealanders from trouble spots; disaster relief and humanitarian operations;
supporting the civil power; and supporting New Zealand's Antarctic programme. The
C-130 has particular utility where runways are short or in poor condition.

**Capability Gaps**

5.35 The declining availability of C-130 air transport is a major capability gap that
will increasingly impinge on the NZDF’s ability to deploy and support personnel. This
is due to the age of the airframe and systems. There is a risk of policy failure,
particularly in the New Zealand, South Pacific and Asia-Pacific contexts, if this project
is not carried out, as the NZDF would not have sufficient air transport to support
deployments and perform other tasks.

**Associate Projects**

5.36 The C-130 communications and navigation systems also need to be upgraded
to address equipment obsolescence and comply with evolving international air traffic
regulations. The communications and navigation upgrade requirements for the C130 are covered in a separate project.

5.37 The C-130 also lacks an adequate self-protection system against manportable infrared missiles. This deficiency is also addressed in a separate project.

**Links to Other Capabilities**

5.38 This project has links to the following projects and capabilities:

- Boeing 727 Replacement

- Light Armoured Vehicles

- Light Operational Vehicles

- Special Forces Capabilities

- C-130/P-3 Self-Protection

- C-130 Communications and Navigation Systems Upgrade

- Deployment of other capabilities


-----

**Timing**

5.39 On 18 November 2002 Cabinet agreed that the C-130 should undergo a 15year life extension and authorised the Ministry of Defence to seek proposals from
industry to complete the necessary work. The tender and evaluation process will be
conducted through 2003 with the intention of signing a contract by mid 2004. The
first mission capable aircraft is expected to be in service in 2006, with fleet
modernisation complete in 2008.

**Current Status**

5.40 Defence officials are preparing the Request for Tender for release to the five
short-listed companies in early July 2003.

**Costs**

5.41 A 15-year life extension is expected to cost $100 million - $170 million.


-----

#### P-3 Communications and Navigation Systems Upgrade

**Description**

5.42 This project involves the upgrade of the P-3 communications and navigation
systems to address equipment obsolescence, meet operational requirements and
comply with evolving international air traffic regulations. This project has been
separated from the previous C-130/P-3 Communications and Navigation Systems
Upgrade project due to the differing requirements of the P-3 and C-130.

**Policy Value**

5.43 The capability provided by the P-3 is central to meeting a broad range of
civilian roles and tasks and for many functions required of the NZDF across the
range of the Government’s five defence policy objectives. The P-3 undertakes
surveillance of New Zealand’s EEZ and the Southern Ocean, meets our South
Pacific search and rescue obligations and provides surveillance assistance to Pacific
Island countries. The P-3 has a high utility for peace support operations, particularly
peace enforcement, both regionally and globally. It is one of the primary force
elements contributing to our defence relationships with Australia and FPDA partners.

**Capability Gap**

5.44 The global air traffic system is being progressively upgraded to increase
system capacity and improve flight efficiency within required flight safety standards.
This upgrade is designed to enable greater use of automated systems, with less
reliance on human input and ground-based systems.

5.45 The P-3s have systems designed for an earlier generation. They are not
compliant with the new air traffic regulations. They also have limited ability to
exchange operational information and will not adequately interface with modernised
NZDF and defence partner capabilities.

5.46 Without upgrading the P-3 communication and navigation systems, the
Government will be faced with policy failure in meeting its objectives relating to aerial
surveillance.

**Links to Other Capabilities**

5.47 This project has links to the following projects and capabilities:

- P-3 Mission Systems Upgrade

- Maritime surveillance

**Timing**

5.48 On 9 December 2002 Cabinet noted the options for upgrading both the P-3
mission systems and communications and navigation systems, and authorised the
Ministry of Defence to seek proposals from industry. The communications and
navigation systems upgrade will be undertaken in conjunction with the P-3 Mission
Systems Upgrade project. The tender and evaluation process will be conducted
through 2003 with the intention of signing a contract by mid 2004. The first mission


-----

capable aircraft is expected to be in service in 2006, with fleet modernisation
complete in 2008/9.

**Current Status**

5.49 The requirements for this project have been incorporated into the Request for
Tender documents that will be issued in June 2003.

**Costs**

5.50 This project is expected to cost $60 million - $100 million.


-----

#### C-130 Communications and Navigation Systems Upgrade

**Description**

5.51 This project involves the upgrade of the C-130 communications and navigation
systems to address equipment obsolescence and comply with evolving international
air traffic regulations. This project has been separated from the previous C-130/P-3
Communications and Navigation Systems Upgrade project due to the differing
requirements of the P-3 and the C-130.

**Policy Value**

5.52 The C-130 is a critical enabler for many NZDF operations. It provides
essential air transport for the deployment of NZDF personnel and some equipment,
within New Zealand, to the South Pacific, Australia, the Asia-Pacific region and
globally. Air transport is a critical capability for a number of roles and tasks,
including: supporting counter-terrorist operations; peace support operations;
evacuations of New Zealanders from trouble spots; disaster relief and humanitarian
operations; supporting the civil power; and supporting New Zealand's Antarctic
programme. The C-130 has particular utility where runways are short or in poor
condition.

**Capability Gap**

5.53 The global air traffic system is being progressively upgraded to increase
system capacity and improve flight efficiency within required flight safety standards.
This upgrade is designed to enable greater use of automated systems, with less
reliance on human input and ground-based systems.

5.54 The C-130s have systems designed for an earlier generation. They are not
compliant with the new air traffic regulations. As more stringent rules and procedures
are implemented, the C-130s will be increasingly restricted in their operation, and
ultimately will be unable to operate.

5.55 Without upgrading the C-130 communication and navigation systems, the
Government will be faced with policy failure in meeting its objectives relating to air
transport.

**Links to Other Capabilities**

5.56 This project has links to the following projects and capabilities:

- C-130 Life Extension

- Air transport

**Timing**

5.57 On 18 November 2002 Cabinet agreed that the C-130 should undergo a 15year life extension and authorised the Ministry of Defence to seek proposals from
industry to complete the necessary work. The communications and navigation
systems upgrade will be undertaken in conjunction with the C-130 Life Extension
project. The tender and evaluation process will be conducted through 2003 with the


-----

intention of signing a contract by mid 2004. The first mission capable aircraft is
expected to be in service in 2006, with fleet modernisation complete in 2008.

**Current Status**

5.58 The requirements for this project have been incorporated into the Request for
Tender documents that will be issued in June 2003.

**Costs**

5.59 This project is expected to cost $100 million - $150 million.

#### Boeing 727 Replacement

**Description**

5.60 This project proposes to replace the Boeing 727 aircraft with commercial jet
aircraft with greater range and payload capacity.

**Policy Value**

5.61 In addition to the C-130s, New Zealand requires a strategic airlift capability
provided by jet transport aircraft. This was previously provided by two Boeing 727
aircraft. Strategic airlift is an enabler for the same roles and tasks as the C-130,
particularly the deployment and sustainment of NZDF forces on overseas
deployments and the evacuation of New Zealand citizens.

**Capability Gaps**

5.62 The declining availability of air transport is a major capability gap that will
increasingly impinge on the NZDF’s ability to deploy and support forces. This decline
is related to both the age of the airframe and systems, and developments in
international navigation/communications requirements. There is a risk of policy
failure, particularly in the New Zealand, South Pacific and Asia-Pacific contexts, if this
project is not carried out, as the NZDF would not have sufficient air transport to
support deployments and perform other tasks.

5.63 The growing pressures on C-130 availability are partly due to the extra use of
C-130s to make up for the declining capability of the Boeing 727. C-130 availability
will decline further when aircraft are taken out of service to undergo a life extension
upgrade. In order to avoid a serious shortfall in the NZDF’s total airlift capacity, it is
desirable to have the Boeing 727 replacement in service before the C-130 life
extension programme commences.

**Links to other Capabilities**

5.64 This project has links to the following projects and capabilities:

- C-130 Life Extension

- Deployment of other NZDF capabilities

**Timing**

5.65 On 18 November 2002 Cabinet agreed to purchase two Boeing 757 aircraft,
including necessary modifications, and authorised the Ministry of Defence to proceed
with the acquisition process. Two Boeing 757 aircraft, in a passenger configuration,
are expected to be in service by mid 2003. Modifications (cargo door, strengthened
floor, airstairs and long range fuel tanks) necessary to meet the full capability
requirements will be undertaken over the following 18 months.


-----

**Current Status**

5.66 Two aircraft have been purchased in a passenger configuration. The first
aircraft arrived in New Zealand in early May and the second aircraft is scheduled to
arrive in June. The required modifications will be made to the aircraft in 2004.

**Costs**

5.67 This project is expected to cost $100 million - $200 million.


-----

#### Direct Fire Support Weapon – Area

**Description**

5.68 The area direct fire support weapon (DFSW-A) project will provide land forces
with the ability to engage groups of enemy at a range of up to two kilometres.

**Policy Value**

5.69 DFSW-A forms an element of any significant land force contribution to peace
enforcement operations in the Asia-Pacific region and globally where land forces may
face a threat on the ground. The DFSW-A is also important in peacekeeping
operations for self-protection and as a deterrent to escalation. The weapon may
have some utility in higher-threat situations in the South Pacific.

**Capability Gap**

5.70 The New Zealand Army presently lacks this capability. This limits the
effectiveness and self-protection capability of land forces, particularly during peace
enforcement operations in the Asia-Pacific region and globally.

**Links to other Capabilities**

5.71 This project has links to the following projects and capabilities:

- Light Armoured Vehicle

- Light Operational Vehicle

- Medium Range Anti-Armour Weapon

- Land Intelligence Surveillance Reconnaissance

**Timing**

5.72 The optimum entry into service for DFSW-A would be during 2004 to coincide
with introduction of the LAV into service.

**Current Status**

5.73 On 9 December 2002 Cabinet authorised the Ministry of Defence to seek
proposals from industry. The acquisition process is now underway.

**Costs**

5.74 This project is expected to cost $15 million.


-----

#### Medium Range Anti-Armour Weapon

**Description**

5.75 This project proposes to provide protection for our land forces from armoured
threats.

**Policy Value**

5.76 The Medium Range Anti-Armour Weapon (MRAAW) provides land forces with
a medium-range capability against armoured vehicles and other targets. It is a critical
part of any contribution to peace enforcement operations where land forces may face
an armoured vehicle threat. The MRAAW also has some utility in peacekeeping
operations in the Asia-Pacific region and globally for self-protection in the event of an
escalation in the threat to ground forces.

**Capability Gap**

5.77 New Zealand land forces are currently very vulnerable to threats from tanks,
armoured vehicles or other anti-armour weapons. There is a need for a capability to
engage these threats at the greatest distance practicable.

5.78 The Army currently has a short-range anti-armour weapon, but it is limited in
range and lethality. A medium-range anti-armour weapon is required to defeat
threats at a greater range (2,300 metres) than the current weapon.

**Links to other Capabilities**

5.79 This project has links to the following projects and capabilities:

- Light Armoured Vehicle

- Light Operational Vehicle

- Direct Fire Support Weapon

- Land Intelligence Surveillance Reconnaissance

**Timing**

5.80 The optimum entry into service for MRAAW would be during 2004 to coincide
with introduction of the LAV into service.

**Current Status**

5.81 On 9 December 2002 Cabinet authorised the Ministry of Defence to acquire
Javelin missiles. The acquisition process is now underway.

**Costs**

5.82 This project is expected to cost $22 million.

### 6 PROJECTS NECESSARY TO AVOID THE FAILURE OF POLICY

#### NZDF Helicopter Capability

**Description**

6.1 This project proposes to replace the Iroquois utility and Sioux training
helicopters with a capability that meets the NZDF’s contemporary needs.

**Policy Value**

6.2 Utility helicopters provide essential support to the Army, particularly in the
South Pacific and in peace support operations. Helicopters are important for
supporting police operations in New Zealand. In addition, utility helicopters are able
to provide a range of support functions within New Zealand and the South Pacific,
such as search and rescue and disaster relief.

6.3 The introduction into service of the MRV will create an additional role for utility
helicopters in supporting the Army ashore, especially in the South Pacific.

**Capability Gap**

6.4 The Iroquois no longer provide the capability required by a modern, mobile
land force. These 36-year-old aircraft are becoming increasingly difficult to support
because of their age. With helicopters assuming greater importance for mobility and
tasks in peace support operations, there is a risk that the Army will be unable
adequately to perform its policy roles and tasks if the Iroquois is not upgraded or
replaced to meet current requirements.

6.5 The Sioux training helicopter is of 1950s vintage and is inadequate to meet
training needs. It does not provide an adequate step in pilot training progression
from the Airtrainer aircraft to operational utility and maritime helicopters.

**Links to other Capabilities**

6.6 This project has links to the following projects and capabilities:

- Special Operations Capabilities

- Multi-Role Vessel

- Army capabilities

**Timing**

6.7 The Iroquois is becoming increasingly difficult and costly to support. The
United States military has begun to withdraw support of the Iroquois to foreign
owners in advance of retiring that aircraft from United States Army service by 2004.
As the Iroquois no long adequately meets NZDF capability requirements, there will
be some operational limitations until the aircraft is replaced, although these will be
manageable. A replacement should be in service around 2007.


-----

6.8 There is some urgency to replace the Sioux training helicopter. It dates from
the 1950s and does not provide an adequate training capability for converting pilots
to helicopter operations. This has caused difficulties in maintaining training
standards and placed an increased burden on the Iroquois, as extra training time is
required on the Iroquois to compensate for the deficiencies of the Sioux.

**Current Status**

6.9 Defence has commenced a project to identify the policy and operational
requirements for an NZDF helicopter capability and then develop costed options.
Once the costed options have been developed, a paper will be brought forward for
Cabinet consideration in August 2003.

**Costs**

6.10 Replacement of the Iroquois is expected to cost $400-550 million.
Replacement of the Sioux with a dedicated training helicopter is expected to cost
around $11 million. The lower end of the cost range is based on 12 helicopters at the
lower end of the capability range replacing the 14 Iroquois.


-----

#### Special Operations Capability

**Description**

6.11 This project provides the Army with equipment to undertake special
operations.

**Policy Value**

6.12 Army special operations capabilities have utility in meeting a range of the
Government’s defence policy objectives and also in supporting policing operations in
New Zealand and the South Pacific.

**Links to Other Capabilities**

6.13 This project has links to the following capabilities:

- Light Operational Vehicles (Special Forces variant)

- Land Intelligence Surveillance Reconnaissance

- NZDF Helicopter Capability

- C-130 Life Extension

**Current Status**

6.14 Work is underway to identify the immediate capability requirements that will
make up this project and the Government will be able to consider options by the end
of August 2003.

**Costs**

6.15 This project is expected to cost around $10 million.


-----

#### Joint Command and Control System 

**Description**

6.16 The Joint Command and Control System (JCCS) project is a programme to
implement an automated command and control system for the NZDF. This IT system
will collect, collate, process, display, store, disseminate and protect command and
control information in near real-time.

**Policy Value**

6.17 Joint command and control is an enabling capability for all of the policy roles
and tasks required of the NZDF. Joint command and control enables elements from
all three services to work together efficiently and effectively by enhancing decisionmaking processes.

**Capability Gap**

6.18 The NZDF’s current command and control systems are largely manual and
paper based. Experience in recent operations and exercises have shown that the
NZDF system is dated and inefficient. This has impacted on the effectiveness of the
Joint Force Headquarters. The slower and less accurate decision making cycle
currently available to commanders is likely to lead to policy failure as it becomes
increasingly difficult for the NZDF to plan operations and effectively co-ordinate its
own operations.

**Links to Other Capabilities**

6.19 The JCCS is an overarching capability that contributes to all NZDF outputs.

6.20 While the JCCS will give the NZDF the ability to manage command and
control information, the project does not provide the ability to communicate data. The
JCCS will therefore depend on the ability of a suitable communications infrastructure,
part of which will be provided by the:

- Joint Communications Modernisation

- Army Tactical Trunk Communications

6.21 These two projects will, however, be directly influenced by the JCCS as the
JCCS will largely determine the requirements for future improvements to the
communications infrastructure.

**Timing**

6.22 A Project Definition Study (PDS) to investigate, provide advice and options,
and make recommendations on a JCCS to meet the NZDF’s command and control
and interoperability requirements commenced in November 2002. The PDS is
planned for completion in October 2003, following which proposals will be brought
forward to Cabinet.


-----

**Current Status**

6.23 The joint NZDF/MoD project team for the JCCS is currently managing the PDS
acquisition process under State Services Commission and Treasury guidelines for
major IT projects.

**Costs**

6.24 This project is expected to cost $15 million - $30 million.


-----

### 7 PROJECTS NECESSARY TO PROVIDE A WELL- EQUIPPED LAND FORCE

#### Land Intelligence Surveillance Reconnaissance 

**Description**

7.1 This project proposes to equip the Army with an improved land Intelligence
Surveillance Reconnaissance (ISR) capability.

**Policy Value**

7.2 An improved land ISR capability provides land forces with the ability to detect
threats at greater distances and with greater certainty. An improved land ISR
capability is an important element in operations where land forces face a demanding
threat environment and need to know what is happening around them.

**Capability Gap**

7.3 Land forces require integral capabilities to identify personnel and vehicles,
both static and moving. Current ISR capabilities are limited to foot, vehicle and
motorcycle patrols and include night vision and some ground sensors. A significantly
larger area, up to 100 by 60 square kilometres, will need to be observed when the
LAV is introduced into service.

**Links to other Capabilities**

7.4 This project has links to the following projects and capabilities:

- Special Operations Capability

- Light Operational Vehicle

- Light Armoured Vehicle

- P-3 Mission Systems Upgrade

- NZDF Helicopter Capability

**Timing**

7.5 A land ISR capability has linkages to a number of projects including the
introduction of the LAV into service, which will start in 2004. Timing of the
introduction of land ISR into service will be calibrated with these projects.

**Current Status**

7.6 Further studies are required to assess joint contributions to land ISR needs,
assess the best mix and numbers of sensors and review personnel issues.

**Costs**

7.7   This project is expected to cost $25 million - $52 million.


-----

#### Army Tactical Trunk Communications

**Description**

7.8 This project proposes to replace and/or upgrade existing Army short-range
communications systems to provide a high bandwidth (high capacity) digital theatre
communication system to support command and control requirements of the NZDF
Battalion Group operations.

**Policy Value**

7.9 The Army Tactical Trunk Communications system will provide an enhanced
capability to exercise command and control over an NZDF battalion group, as well as
communicate with allied forces. It forms an important component of any battalion
group deployment, particularly in peace enforcement operations where good
command, control and communications enhance the safety and effectiveness of land
forces.

**Capability Gap**

7.10 Current Army tactical trunk communications systems are voice oriented,
technologically old, and are comprised of ad hoc and short-term systems. This limits
the Army’s ability to exchange information between deployed Army sub-units. An
upgraded system would provide short-range communications that interface between
medium/long range communications and the tactical units. This system needs to be
military specification equipment.

**Links to Other Capabilities**

7.11 The Army tactical trunk communications system will need to be interoperable
with other NZDF communications systems, particularly the JCCS and the Joint
Modernisation Communications.

**Timing and Current Status**

7.12 This capability needs to be implemented following the outcome of the JCCS
project definition study and on completion of a separate study to determine the work
required to achieve an integrated communications infrastructure.

**Costs**

7.13 This project is expected to cost up to $10 million.


-----

#### Combat Service Support Vehicles

**Description**

7.14 This project has two parts:

- Additional combat service support trucks, to provide support to the LAV. LAV
support vehicles include fuel, water and bulk-handling equipment (moving
containers/pallets over rough terrain).

- Later in the decade, a replacement for the Unimog general service trucks that
provide service, maintenance and sustainability to the motorised battalions,
specifically LAV and LOV logistic support.

**Policy Value**

7.15 Combat service support vehicles are a critical enabler for LAV motorised
operations. They sustain and resupply the LAVs with fuel, personnel and spares and
provide maintenance support. Their utility in meeting policy objectives is in peace
support operations in the Asia-Pacific region and globally.

**Capability Gap**

7.16 The introduction of the LAV will create an additional requirement for combat
service support trucks beyond the Army’s current capabilities.

7.17 In addition, the current fleet of Unimog general service trucks (2.5 and 4
tonne) will be 25 years old in 2008. At this age they will be approaching the end of
their economic life and will require replacement.

**Links to other Capabilities**

7.18 This project has links to the following projects and capabilities:

- Light Armoured Vehicle

- Light Operational Vehicle

- Multi-Role Vessel

**Timing**

7.19 The optimum start time for the introduction into service of the additional
combat service support capabilities would be during 2004 to coincide with
introduction of the LAV into service.

7.20 The Unimogs will need to be replaced from around 2008/9. Timing will
depend on the levels of serviceability of the Unimogs..

**Current Status**

7.21 Defence officials are preparing options for the Government to consider
towards the end of 2003.


-----

**Costs**

7.22 This project is expected to cost $10 million for immediate needs and $20
million from 2008/09 to replace the Unimogs.


-----

#### Army Engineering Equipment

**Description**

7.23 This project proposes to enhance Army engineering equipment to support
mobility of the motorised land force. Equipment includes:

- Combat engineering tractors

- 20 metre light bridging equipment

- Lane way track laying equipment (metal carpet rolled in front of a truck)

- Water purification/storage

**Policy Value**

7.24 Additional engineering equipment will enable LAVs and LOVs to cross
obstacles that may be encountered. Some engineering equipment may also be
necessary to enable landing operations from the MRV.

7.25 The policy utility of this equipment will be in supporting the LAVs when
deployed on peace support operations in the Asia-Pacific region and globally.

**Capability Gap**

7.26 Current engineering capabilities are very limited and not oriented towards
motorisation. Additional capabilities are necessary to provide for the increase in the
scale of mobility requirements associated with the increased number of vehicles in
the motorised battalion. This also includes providing for the crossing of gaps and
broken or soft ground, potentially including beach crossing from the MRV.

7.27 The Army lacks water purification and storage capacity.

**Links to other Capabilities**

7.28 This project has links to the following projects and capabilities:

- Light Armoured Vehicle

- Light Operational Vehicle

- Multi-Role Vessel

**Timing**

7.29 The engineering equipment is required to coincide with introduction of the LAV
into service, starting in 2004.

**Current Status**

7.30 Defence officials are preparing options for the Government to consider
towards the end of 2003.


-----

**Costs**

7.31 This project is expected to cost around $15 million.


-----

#### Army In-Service Weapon Replacement

**Description**

7.32 This project proposes to replace the following in-service weapons when they
become due for replacement around 2007-2009:

- 1000 C9 light machine guns

- Special Forces miscellaneous weapons

- Carl Gustav light anti-armour weapons

**Policy Value**

7.33 The above small arms are integral to the full range of land force operations
and have applications in a host of policy roles.

**Capability Gap**

7.34 Current weapons are serviceable but will require replacement around 2007–
2009.

**Timing**

7.35 The weapons do not require replacement until 2007-2009.

**Current Status**

7.36. No action required at this stage.

**Costs**

7.37 This project is expected to cost around $8 million.


-----

#### Very Low Level Air Defence

**Description**

7.38 This project proposes to purchase additional equipment to bring the Mistral Air
Defence System up to operational standard.

**Policy Value**

7.39 An air defence capability is necessary to protect critical land force elements
from air threats such as low flying aircraft and armed helicopters.

**Capability Gap**

7.40 The current system is not fully operational. Target detection, identification and
tracking rely on visual observation. To be fully effective and minimise risk to friendly
aircraft, the system requires an auto cueing and identification friend or foe (IFF)
capability.

**Timing**

7.41 This project should proceed as soon as possible.

**Current Status**

7.42 Work is underway to identify the best option to bring the system up to a fully
operational standard. Once updated cost information is received, a submission will
be brought forward to Cabinet seeking approval to proceed with acquisition of the
required components.

**Costs**

7.43 This project is estimated to cost $12 million.


-----

### 8 PROJECTS NECESSARY TO AVOID SIGNIFICANT RISKS TO POLICY

#### ANZAC Self-Defence Upgrade

**Description**

8.1 This project proposes to upgrade the ANZAC frigates’ self-defence systems to
protect the Naval Combat Force against increasingly sophisticated anti-ship systems
and to address equipment obsolescence.

**Policy Value**

8.2 The role of the Naval Combat Force is to meet military tasks, particularly in
support of the Government’s regional and global objectives. The ANZACs are critical
to the protection of New Zealand/Australian territorial sovereignty, for participating in
FPDA activities, supporting our relationships with regional partners, and undertaking
peace support operations in the Asia-Pacific region and beyond. These
environments contain significantly higher threats to surface vessels than exist in New
Zealand’s immediate area, including air and sub-surface threats. To continue
operating in these environments, and therefore meet the Government’s policy
requirements, the ANZACs will require an upgrade to their defensive systems to
meet the changing threat levels in these areas.

**Capability Gap**

8.3 By the end of the decade, the increase in air, surface and sub-surface threats,
and the sophistication of these threats, within the Australia/Asia-Pacific region and
beyond will mean that the defensive systems onboard the ANZACs will become
increasingly ineffective. Consequently, the operational capability of the ANZACs will
decline to the point where their ability to operate in these environments would carry
serious risks.

8.4 The design of the majority of self-defence equipment on the ANZACs will be
approaching 25 years of age by 2010. Support will become increasingly difficult and
operating costs will rise. In some cases, such as the anti-air missile, existing
systems are becoming increasingly difficult to support.

**Links to other Capabilities**

8.5 This project has links to the following projects and capabilities:

- NZDF Torpedo Replacement

- Multi-Role Vessel

- Anti-Ship Missiles

- P-3 Mission Systems Upgrade

**Timing**

8.6 This project needs to be implemented from around the end of this decade.


-----

**Current Status**

8.7 Preliminary work is underway to scope the project and determine the best way
to implement the package of required work.

**Costs**

8.8 This project is expected to cost around $300 million.

**Possible Options**

8.9 It may be possible to share in economies of scale with the Australian project to
upgrade ANZAC self-defence systems. The self-defence capability comprises a
number of components and these may be able to be implemented in a phased
manner.


-----

#### NZDF Torpedo Replacement

**Description**

8.10 This project proposes to replace the torpedoes for the ANZAC frigates, P-3
Orions and SH-2G Seasprite helicopters to maintain the ANZAC’s basic self-defence
capability against sub-surface threats and the P-3’s area anti-submarine capability.

**Policy Value**

8.11 The role of the Naval Combat Force is to meet military tasks, particularly in
support of the Government’s regional and global objectives. The ANZACs are critical
to the protection of New Zealand/Australia territorial sovereignty, for participating in
FPDA activities, supporting our relationships with regional partners, and undertaking
peace support operations in the Asia-Pacific region and beyond. These
environments contain significantly higher threats to surface vessels than exist in New
Zealand’s immediate environs, including air and sub-surface threats. Torpedoes
provide a basic self-defence capability against sub-surface threats, and enable the
ANZACs to be safely deployed in these environments.

8.12 The P-3s require a torpedo replacement to maintain their current capability to
fulfil the above policy roles.

**Capability Gap**

8.13 The current torpedoes will reach the end of their life around 2007, limiting the
ability of the ANZACs to be deployed to areas beyond the South Pacific where subsurface threats may be encountered. This would impact most significantly on the
ability of the ANZACs to provide support for peace enforcement operations, such as
during INTERFET. It would also limit the utility of the ANZACs as a contribution to
the protection of New Zealand/Australia territorial sovereignty.

8.14 The absence of a torpedo capability will mean that the P-3 aircraft will be
unable to provide area protection for New Zealand naval vessels against submarine
threats.

**Links to other Capabilities**

8.15 This project has links to the following projects and capabilities:

- ANZAC Self-Defence Upgrade

- Multi-Role Vessel

- Anti-Ship Missiles

- P-3 Mission Systems Upgrade

**Timing**

8.16 The current Mark 46 Mod 2 torpedo will not be supportable beyond about
2007. A replacement will need to be in service before the current torpedoes become
unsupportable.


-----

**Current Status**

8.17 Work is underway to consider options to replace the current torpedo.

**Costs**

8.18 This project is expected to cost around $30 million.


-----

#### C-130/P-3 Self-Protection

**Description**

8.19 This project proposes to equip the C-130 and P-3 with a self-protection
capability against likely threats, primarily man-portable infrared (IR) missiles.

**Policy Value**

8.20 The C-130 is a critical enabler for many NZDF operations. It provides
essential air transport for a number of roles and tasks, including: supporting counterterrorist operations; peace support operations; evacuations of New Zealanders from
trouble spots; disaster relief and humanitarian operations; supporting the civil power;
and supporting New Zealand's Antarctic programme.

8.21 The capability provided by the P-3 is critical to meeting many of the roles and
tasks required of the NZDF across the range of the Government’s five defence policy
objectives. The P-3 is critical for the surveillance of New Zealand’s EEZ and the
Southern Ocean. It is also critical to meeting our South Pacific obligations. The P-3
is one of the primary capabilities that contributes to our defence relationships with
Australia and FPDA partners, and is of high utility for peace support operations.

8.22 C-130s and P-3s are expensive assets and moreover carry a significant
number of people. It is important therefore to protect those assets and minimise the
risks to people onboard.

**Capability Gaps**

8.23 The current C-130 self-protection fit was installed in the early 1990s. Since
that time there has been a significant increase in the sophistication and availability of
missiles. The current system is no longer appropriate for today’s threat environment.

8.24 The P-3 currently has no dedicated self-protection equipment. The aircraft’s
sensors inherently provide protection from long-range and/or obvious threats. Manportable missiles are easy to conceal, however, and detection may not be possible
before the aircraft has closed within range of the weapon. It is therefore necessary to
be able to detect the missile launch and use countermeasure techniques to defeat it.

8.25 In the last 15 years, 90 percent of all aircraft lost in combat have been
attributed to infrared (IR) guided missiles. Specifically, these aircraft have fallen to
man-portable missile systems. These shoulder-launched systems are widespread
globally. Lack of a self-protection capability could limit the use of our C-130s or P-3s
in humanitarian or peace support operations globally.

**Links to Other Capabilities**

8.26 This project has links to the following projects and capabilities:

- C-130 Life Extension

- P-3 Mission Systems Upgrade


-----

**Timing**

8.27 This project should be considered to allow this project to be completed during
the upgrade projects for the C-130 and P-3. This project will, however, be tendered
separately. Ideally, a self-protection capability would be available as the upgraded
aircraft return to service.

**Current Status**

8.28 Work is underway to determine the appropriate self-protection requirement
and the Government will be able to consider options by mid-2004.

**Costs**

8.29 This project is expected to cost around $30 million.


-----

#### Anti-Ship Missiles

**Description**

8.30 This project proposes to equip the P-3 aircraft with an anti-ship missile
capability.

**Policy Value**

8.31 Equipping the P-3 aircraft with an anti-ship missile capability would
significantly enhance the value of these aircraft in fulfilling policy roles relating to the
territorial sovereignty of New Zealand and Australia, playing an appropriate role in
the maintenance of security in the Asia-Pacific region, and participating in the FPDA.

**Capability Gap**

8.32 Disbanding the Air Combat Force has resulted in the loss of the maritime
strike capability. The P-3s provide targeting information but do not have an anti-ship
capability. The inability to take immediate action against surface threats limits the P3’s ability to provide force protection for New Zealand naval vessels, particularly the
frigates and, in future, the MRV.

**Links to other Capabilities**

8.33 This project has links to the following projects and capabilities:

- P-3 Mission Systems Upgrade

- Multi-Role Vessel

- ANZAC frigates

**Timing**

8.34 The timing of this project is dependent on the completion of the P-3 mission
systems upgrade. The modification required to enable the P-3 to launch anti-ship
missiles is relatively straightforward and could be done during routine maintenance.
A minimum number of missiles would need to be purchased, with the rest obtainable
through an access arrangement. Before a missile capability is added, the mission
systems upgrade would be necessary to provide sensors capable of locating and
properly identifying targets.

**Current Status**

8.35 A study will be conducted in due course to determine the appropriate weapons
for the P-3.

**Costs**

8.36 This project is expected to cost $10 million to equip the P-3 with the capability
to launch anti-ship missiles and a further $10 million - $15 million for the missiles.

#### Joint Communications Modernisation

**Description**

8.37 This project proposes to modernise the NZDF’s long-range and medium-range
communications capability to ensure that the NZDF maintains a reliable, integrated,
world-wide communications infrastructure. This communications infrastructure will
support NZDF deployed forces, ships and aircraft operating outside short-range radio
coverage and enable communications between force elements deployed to different
parts of a theatre of operations.

8.38 The modernisation will support higher data transfer rates and modern
communication protocols, with a mix of military and commercial communications
services.

**Policy Value**

8.39 As communications are critical in almost all roles, the modernisation of the
communications infrastructure is important in the achievement of defence policy
objectives in New Zealand’s environs, the South Pacific, the Asia-Pacific region and,
potentially, in contributions to global security and peacekeeping.

**Capability Gap**

8.40 Current communications systems are single Service oriented, technologically
dated, and comprise ad hoc and short-term systems. Communications between the
Joint Force Headquarters and units deployed or operating beyond short-range radio
coverage will not meet requirements, resulting in an inability to exchange information
between NZDF units and allies. Deferral of this project will limit the type and
timeliness of information that can be exchanged and thus will limit the ability of the
NZDF to develop a modern, integrated command control communications and
intelligence capability.

**Links to Other Capabilities**

8.41 Long-range and medium-range communication systems form an essential part
of the NZDF communications infrastructure and contribute to all NZDF outputs. This
project is dependent on the completion of the JCCS project definition study and is
linked to the Army Tactical Communications System.

**Timing**

8.42 Modernisation of this capability needs to be started around 2005 to fully
realise the benefits of the JCCS and the enhanced communications systems being
introduced with other projects such as the P-3 mission systems upgrade and the
MRV. To provide a fully effective command, control, communications and
intelligence capability, the communications infrastructure must match the capability of
the JCCS.


-----

**Current Status**

8.43 A study is underway to determine the programme of work required to achieve
an integrated communications infrastructure. This study, along with input from the
JCCS project definition study, will assist in developing a strategy to implement this
project.

**Costs**

8.44 This project is expected to cost $20 million - $40 million.

#### Ohakea Hardstanding Reconstruction

**Description**

8.45 This project proposes to reconstruct the Ohakea hardstanding and taxiways to
keep the airfield fully operational for military and commercial use.

**Policy Value**

8.46 The Government has agreed in principle to vacate Whenuapai and
consolidate RNZAF operational capability at Ohakea. Ohakea will be the sole
operational airfield for the Air Force supporting the operations of the maritime
surveillance aircraft, air transport aircraft, and helicopters.

**Capability Gap**

8.47 The hexagonal block construction of the hardstanding area and taxiways is
failing due to irregular aircraft usage far above the original design limits. Eventually,
the hardstanding and taxiways will become unusable and restrict aircraft operation.
An upgrade of these areas is essential for Ohakea to continue as an operational
base and to support an increase in air traffic. Restrictions on aircraft operations at
Ohakea impact on the ability of the Air Force to operate.

**Links to Other Capabilities**

8.48 This project has links to the following projects and capabilities:

- Ohakea Runway Reconstruction (now completed)

- Air Force consolidation at Ohakea

- Air transport

- Maritime surveillance

**Timing**

8.49 Reconstruction work needs to be undertaken around 2010.

**Current Status**

8.50 Ongoing monitoring of hardstanding and taxiway condition.

**Costs**

8.51 This project is expected to cost $8 million.

### 9 PROJECTS THAT HAVE BENEFIT BUT ARE LESS CRITICAL TO ACHIEVING POLICY OBJECTIVES

**High Readiness Infantry Company**

9.1 The Army does not maintain a high readiness infantry company that can
undertake many short-notice tasks. This represents a policy gap and affects
deployment times.

**Short Range Air Patrol**

9.2 The Maritime Patrol Review identified a need for a short-medium range air
patrol capability to complement the long range P-3. Options include provision of
patrol services by a commercial contractor or by the Air Force. A commercial
contract is estimated to cost in the order of $8-10 million annually. The Air Force
could potentially provide the service at a lower annual cost by combining this task
with existing training requirements or increasing P-3 surveillance hours. The Ministry
of Fisheries is undertaking a study of coastal and mid-range air patrol capabilities
and this work will consider the options available, including RNZAF aircraft and
commercial service providers amongst others, and assess their cost-effectiveness. A
final report to departments – including Defence – is due by 31 October 2003.

**Modifications to enable MRV/OPV to operate in the Ross Sea**

9.3 The Maritime Forces Review identified a requirement for patrolling in the
Southern Ocean and in the Ross Sea. At least one of the vessels (the MRV and/or
OPVs) should be capable of conducting operations in these waters. Advice will be
sought from industry as to the marginal cost of including an ice-strenthened capability
in the vessel design. Funding for this capability is included in the $500 million
allocated for the naval surface fleet.

**Remote Mine Detection**

9.4 The Maritime Forces Review identified a requirement to protect New Zealand's
major ports by developing a capacity to detect and dispose of mines and other
explosives underwater. The Review concluded that the mine countermeasures role
should be retained. The capability of the Navy to detect mine-like objects is
becoming increasingly difficult as current equipment reaches the end of its
economical life. Upgrading this capability would significantly improve the safety of
personnel and ships over the current inadequate, emergency only, systems.

**Army Manoeuvre Range**

9.5 A moving target range enables soldiers and commanders to practice skills
necessary to conduct motorised operations. The range would allow the practice of
low level manoeuvre (up to platoon level) while engaging static and moving targets.

**Indirect Fire Support Weapon**

9.6 Army currently has 81mm mortars and the 105mm artillery howitzer. Based
on current usage and firing wear and tear, both weapons are expected to require
replacement around 2012.


-----

**Infrastructure projects**

9.7 There are a range of infrastructure requirements that will need to be
addressed over the next ten years. These projects will upgrade or replace existing
facilities and may reduce infrastructure and operating costs.
