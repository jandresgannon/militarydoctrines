##### OPENING STATEMENT BY THE MINISTER OF DEFENCE OF UKRAINE

2016 was the first year of the defence reform implementation, providing radical
transformation of the UAF. Furthermore, I would like to stress that no country in
the world has more recent experience of such significant defence reform under the
conditions of war fighting.

At the same time, the development and enactment of the following defence planning
documentation with the support of the President and the Government of Ukraine were
completed: The Concept for the Development of the Security and Defence Sector of
Ukraine; Strategic Defence Bulletin of Ukraine; the State Target Defence Program on
Materiel Development up to 2020 and the State Program on Armed Forces Development
up to 2020.

To ensure the successful implementation of defence reform, the Reform Committee
of the Ministry of Defence (MoD) and UAF was established. The organisational
structure of the MoD has been optimized and 25% of units of the General Staff of the
UAF have been reformed to align with the principles of NATO nations.

The Joint Operational Headquarters and Special Operations Forces have been
formed and incorporated into the UAF. High Mobility Assault Forces were withdrawn
from Land Forces and re-formed as a separate branch of the UAF.

We took immediate action to provide our Armed Forces with equipment, to meet
their basic needs. This included the introduction of 20 new variants of weapon systems
and military equipment being adopted in 2016 as a result of Government trials.

Fundamental changes have been made in the military training system. The training
capabilities have increased and notably, in 2016 there were almost a third more
operational training exercises than in 2015. In addition, the Training Centre of Special
Operations was established (Berdychiv, Zhytomyr region); the Centre for Training
and Improvement at the International Peacekeeping and Security Centre is nearing
completion (Yavoriv, Lviv region) and the training capability of Shyrokyi Lan Training
Ground is being enhanced.

For the fi rst time since Ukraine’s independence the Army air crews conducted


-----

live firing drills and precision attacks on air targets. In the framework of the Joint
Multinational Training Group-Ukraine (JMTG-U) five Ukrainian battalions were trained
in accordance with NATO standards.

We have managed to improve the overall level of logistic support that ensured the
creation and transition to a new logistics system, compliant with NATO standards, for
the UAF.

A new design of the UAF uniform was developed and is being rolled out across the
UAF.

Based on a review of the catering system of the Armed Forces, in 2017 we plan
to transfer 25 millitary units to a new catering system with a more diverse diet and
delicious dishes.

The cornerstone of the public procurement reform to counter corruption was the
introduction of an e-procurement system, ProZorro. This accelerated the bidding
procedures, ensured their transparency and delivered significant savings. In addition,
the activity of the Tender Committee of the MoD was reorganized and adopted new
European principles.

Following the National Anticorruption Policy, we enacted a unified system
of corruption prevention for all levels of military administration. This included, in
December 2016, the establishment of five regional anti-corruption units for the UAF.

NATO has reinforced its support for capability development and capacity building
in Ukraine. A comprehensive assistance package for Ukraine, which identified 40 areas
of cooperation with the alliance, was adopted at the NATO summit in Warsaw. We
continue to receive advisory, logistical and humanitarian assistance from the partner
countries. In support of the MoD and UAF, are more than 30 advisers from 12 NATO
nations and five strategic advisers from the US, UK, Canada, Lithuania and Germany,
who work closely alongside us.

We clearly understand that one of the most important factors for the UAF to
successfully perform their duties, including those in the anti-terrorist operation (ATO)
in eastern Ukraine, is the appropriate level of welfare and State support for service
personnel and their families. In 2016, we managed to significantly increase allowances
for service personnel, including the provision of an operational allowance to those who
were directly involved in the ATO.

We have developed a strategy to provide housing for military personnel and their
families through either the construction of their own homes, purchase or a housing
grant, etc., and are establishing regulatory and legal practices to implement it.

The procedure for providing medical care in military medical establishments
and associated payments for it between defence and security organisations has been
improved.

Thus, I can confidently say that during the last year, the Armed Forces have increased
their capability to perform their tasks and are ready to deter armed conflict and repel
armed aggression against Ukraine. Our soldiers’ morale and patriotism with which they
defend each centimetre of Ukrainian land remain consistently high.

I am quite sure that the fundamental reforms that we launched in 2016 are
irreversible.

I have no doubt - we will achieve our defined goals.

#### RESULTS OF THE ARMED FORCES  OF UKRAINE REFORM  IN 2016 AND PARTICIPATION  IN THE ANTI-TERRORIST OPERATION

n 2016, the main efforts of the MoD and the General Staff were focused on the performance of the UAF
### Iin conducting their assigned tasks in the anti-terrorist operation; balancing the structure, composition

and size of the military administration; increasing the combat readiness of the Armed Forces; providing
comprehensive support to meet their needs, as well as creating a legal framework for the further
development of the UAF.


IMPROVEMENT OF
THE STATE POLICY
IN THE DEFENCE
DOMAIN


In 2016, the necessary steps to create a new conceptual framework for the security
and defence sector of Ukraine based on the National Security Strategy[1] and Military
Doctrine of Ukraine[2] were continued. In particular, the President of Ukraine approved
the Concept for the Development of the Security and Defence Sector of Ukraine[3],
Strategic Defence Bulletin of Ukraine[4] and the State Target Defence Program on
Materiel Development up to 2020. The National Security and Defence Council of
Ukraine approved the State Program on Armed Forces Development up to 2020.


**Note 1.1. Implementation of the Concept for Development**
of Security and Defence Sector of Ukraine provides for:



- establishment of effective command system of Security and
Defence Sector as an integrated functional system;

- combination of operational capabilities of Security and Defence
Sector components to ensure timely and effective response to
crisis situations which threaten national security;

- constant maintenance of security and defence forces readiness
to perform assigned tasks;

- improvement of the planning system within the Security and
Defence Sector, providing effective use of national resources;

- gradual and coordinated increase of operational capability
of Security and Defence Sector as well as the level of their
readiness to immediately respond to threats and challenges to
the national security of Ukraine;

- creating conditions to widely engage non-governmental
organizations to perform tasks in the interests of national
security and defence of the state.


Thus, for the first time in the history of Ukraine,
the defence planning documents have been developed
in full, based on the results of a comprehensive review
of the security and defence sector.

The basis for the reform of Ukraine’s Security and
Defence Sector is the Concept for the Development
of the Security and Defence Sector of Ukraine. This
identifies ways to achieve required defence capabilities
allowing Ukraine to restore its territorial integrity within
the internationally recognized State borders of Ukraine
and ensure the creation of a national crisis response
system, early detection, preventing internal and external
threats to national security and their neutralization, and
cyber security (Note 1.1).

In terms of hybrid warfare, the priority is uniting
efforts to repel aggression, strengthening national
defence, strengthening the Defence forces and their
capabilities through a radical reform of the UAF.

**Note 1.2. Strategic goals of the Defence Reform:**



- integrated command of the defence forces in accordance with
principles and standards of NATO-member countries;

- effective policy, resource planning and management system by
applying modern Euro-Atlantic approaches;

- operational capabilities of defence forces, necessary to defeat
armed aggression, defend the country, as well as to support
peace and international security;

- integrated logistics and medical support system, capable of
supporting all defence forces components;

- professionalization of defence forces and the formation of a
military reserve.


Principles of defence reform are defined in the Strategic
Defence Bulletin of Ukraine (Note 1.2).

The aim of defence reform includes: the requirement
by defence forces to achieve and maintain the necessary
level of combat readiness; the ability to perform the
tasks of national defence; effective response to emerging
military threats and military and political challenges to
national security; improvement of the interoperability of
the UAF and other military formations with the armed
forces of NATO and the European Union to enable them
to perform common tasks in international peacekeeping
operations.

The main bodies of reform are as follows:



  - State authorities that exercise powers in the field of defence,

  - Defence forces, their composition, functions and tasks, structure, strength,
training, equipment, capability, logistical support, disposition, etc.,

  - Defence industry, military and technical cooperation.

Ensuring coordination, monitoring and evaluation of military reform was entrusted
to the Reform Committee of the MoD and the UAF (the Reform Committee) chaired by
the Minister of Defence of Ukraine. The Reform Committee includes representatives of
the MoD of Ukraine and other central executive authorities, the UAF, other components
of the defence forces, advisors from NATO Member Nations, MPs of the Verkhovna
Rada, volunteers and representatives of civil society.

The Reform Committee consists of five subcommittees, each chaired by an
official who is personally responsible and accountable for the successful and timely
implementation of the relevant strategic objectives (Figure 1.1).

**Figure 1.1. Structure of the Reform Committee of the Ministry of Defence of Ukraine and**

chapter 1


Civil society fully exercises the principle of
democratic civilian oversight over the UAF through the
Reform Committee thereby ensuring the transparency of
decision making in defence policy.

In total, over 200 meetings of subcommittees and
working groups of the Reform Committee were held
during 2016.

Improving the regulatory framework
in the defence domain

In 2016, legislative and normative activities within
the MoD were aimed at the tasks of implementing the
reforms of the Defence department, in order to ensure
the defence of the State and the creation of a modern
combat-ready Armed Forces.

The result of legislative activities of the MoD was the adoption of two laws of
Ukraine, the decision of the Verkhovna Rada of Ukraine, 20 decrees and one order of
the President of Ukraine, 49 decisions and 35 resolutions of the Cabinet of Ministers
of Ukraine, which have allowed:

  - to improve the preparation of State for national defence;

  - to complete development of defence planning documents;

  - to initiate the implementation of defence reform and reform the MoD and the
General Staff and other military management bodies, including command and
control of Special Operations Forces and High Mobility Assault Forces;

  - to determine the place of Joint Operations Headquarters, Special Operations
Forces, and High Mobility Assault Forces in the overall structure of the Armed
Forces and their legal status;

  - to meet the UAF’s urgent requirement for modern military equipment;

  - to define territorial distribution of responsibility and powers of command and
control in all domains: land, air, maritime;

  - to determine the terms of military service in the UAF for non-Ukrainian nationals
and stateless persons;

  - to increase the level of welfare and State support, for military personnel;
including, but not limited to: legal assistance; housing benefits; uniform
payments and relocation expenses;

  - to improve catering provision and quality in the Armed Forces and across the
Defence and Security Sector;

  - to improve the procedure for granting war participant status to persons who
defended the independence, sovereignty and territorial integrity of Ukraine and
who were directly involved in the ATO.

Legislative and regulatory acts adopted in 2016 have contributed to the
implementation of the role of the Armed Forces. The list of major regulations is given
in Annex 1.

RESULTS OF THE
ARMED FORCES
REFORM IN 2016


In 2016, the Armed Forces successfully performed defence related tasks by repelling
and deterring armed aggression against Ukraine, protecting the airspace of the State
and Sub-surface space within the territorial sea, preventing the spread of the crisis
situation to other regions of Ukraine, deterring armed conflict and isolating the crisis
areas in Eastern Ukraine. Necessary arrangements have been made for the development
of the Armed Forces in order to improve their ability to effectively respond to military
threats to national security, protect Ukraine’s sovereignty, territorial integrity and
inviolability.

As part of the Defence Reform in 2016, the MoD was reorganised and reduced
in size. The new organisational structure of the MoD, its hierarchical structure and
distribution of basic tasks and responsibilities between all departments were approved,
including:

  - the State Secretary of the MoD and heads of departments of the MoD have been
appointed in compliance with the legislation requirements;

  - some duties of the Defence Minister have been delegated to his Deputies, and
from the Deputy Ministers - to the heads of departments of the MoD. In addition,
the decision making authority, along with the responsibility for output of each
functional area, has been delegated;

  - MoD departments have been merged and reorganised, which has assisted in the
effective solving of complex problems (see. Section 2);

                    - functional responsibilities have been reviewed and
all personnel have undergone a selection process, which
helped to form a civilian professional staff of the MoD;

                    - the concept of information infrastructure has
been approved. The transition to electronic document
circulation by using secure software has been introduced
within Ministry and for communication with other
government agencies;

                    - the legal framework has been revised, obsolete
regulatory provisions have been recognized as invalid;

                    - a roadmap for the implementation of Capability
Based Planning, which includes a comprehensive
approach to threats to national security, financial,
economic and defence capacity of the State has been approved;

  - transparency and efficiency of resource utilization in the MoD was achieved by
using a new online procurement system ProZorro. Starting from August 1, 2016,
citizens can view the online bid results and compare average sales prices;

  - the reform of the internal control and risk management systems is mainly
complete.

Given the principles and criteria of NATO member countries, 25% of structural units
of the General Staff of the Armed Forces have been reformed.

New guidelines for the preparation and use of the Armed Forces have been
developed, including:

  - Fundamentals of Preparation and Conduct of Operations;

  - Guidelines for Operational Headquarters;

  - Field Manuals for armoured and mechanized forces, air defence, aviation, radio
and air defence forces.

chapter 1


Appropriate measures to reform the national codification system (weapons and
special equipment) compatible with the NATO codification system have been conducted.
A specific NATO Trust Fund has provided any necessary assistance.

Thus, the MoD and General Staff have improved the management system of the
Armed Forces that is based on the new distribution of responsibilities, authority
and accountability and using the following principle – the Ministry of Defence of
Ukraine forms the defence policy and General Staff of the UAF implements this
policy.

Key measures to reform the Armed Forces

In 2016 the planned areas for reform included:

  - further improvement of the command system;

  - reorganization and standardisation of structures of combat units;

  - formation of a Special Operations Forces Command;

  - the ability to restore and repair weapons and military equipment.

The following were achieved:

  - Special Operations Forces were formed and incorporated in the Armed Forces;

  - High Mobility Assault Forces were withdrawn from the Land Forces and formed
as a separate branch of the Armed Forces;

  - combat composition of the Land Forces and land component of the Naval Forces
increased in unit numbers and strength;

  - the Reserve Corps Command was formed (Kyiv).

The structure of combat brigades was improved based on the lessons learned in
the ATO. In particular, the proportion of combat units and their effective fire power
was increased; intelligence units, artillery units, and primarily anti-tank units were
reinforced. The flexibility and resilience of combat brigades was also increased by an
improved supply chain.

One of the priorities of the Armed Forces reform was to increase the combat
capabilities of High Mobility Assault Forces. For this purpose, airmobile brigades were
reorganized into landing assault brigades, and their effective firepower was increased.

The Air Force Command and Control capability was increased, with the
establishment of the Command and Control Centre “East”. Airfield defence units and
anti-aircraft missile defence units were reinforced.

chapter 1


RESULTS OF THE ARMED FORCES OF UKRAINE REFORM IN 2016 AND PARTICIPATION IN THE ATO

A separate Artillery Brigade, Missile Artillery Regiment, Separate Naval Infantry
Battalion, and the Institute of the Naval Forces of the National University «Odessa
Maritime Academy» have been formed in the Naval Forces.

Special Operations Forces Command achieved Full Operating Capability. To
enhance the capabilities of evacuation and repair of combat equipment, the number of
evacuation and maintenance units has been increased.

Overall, the MoD and the Armed Forces have performed 4,382 organizational
activities, including 195 high value defence activities. (Table 1.1).

The Concept of Building the New NCO Professional Development System was
introduced. During 2016, about 70 000 personnel joined the military under these new
terms.

However, conscription was retained as the basis element for the formation of a
military reserve and to prepare contracted servicemen.

More than 100 000 people were included in the military operational reserve of
immediate activation. Military records of about 400 000 conscripts have been recovered
following the malicious destruction.

Armed Forces reform has provided an opportunity to improve the structure and
command and control system of the UAF by bringing it closer to NATO standards,
increasing the combat composition of the Armed Forces and creating a separate Special
Operations Force.

RESULTS OF THE
ARMED FORCES
PARTICIPATION IN THE
ANTI-TERRORIST
OPERATION


Following the Minsk agreement, the National Security Strategy of Ukraine and the
Military Doctrine of Ukraine, despite the difficult military and political situation in the
area of the ATO and risks of an escalation of the millitary standoff, the armed forces
and other security sector components have organized defence in depth along the entire
dividing line to deter further enemy incursion.

The overall situation in the ATO area remained tense but controlled and was
characterized by constant shelling and attacks on UAF positions.

By increasing funding for the security and defence sector, the supply of new models
of weapons and military equipment to the Armed Forces has been improved, which has
helped to increase the available fire power of military units.

Military salaries of service personnel under contract have been raised in accordance
with the Decree of the President of Ukraine, which allowed for the manning of combat

units without resorting to conscription. The majority of contracted soldiers had previous
service in the ATO.

The results of the Armed Forces participation in the anti-terrorist operation
in the separate regions of Donetsk and Luhansk oblasts temporarily
outside the control of the government of Ukraine

During 2016, the Armed Forces were increasing their combat capability, the level
of logistical support by using recent combat experience, and achieved the required
capacity to protect territorial integrity and inviolability of the state.

Pursuant to the Framework Decision of the Trilateral Contact Group relating to
disengagement of forces and hardware, starting from September 23, 2016, the UAF
continued fulfilling the conditions of the ceasefire agreement in the vicinity of Stanytsya
Luganska, Zolote, Petrivs’ke, and withdrew heavy weapons from the areas defined by
this decision.

At the same time, UAF units have managed to improve their tactical position in
Mariupol, Avdiivka and Bahmut directions without violation of the terms the Minsk
agreements.

During 2016, the enemy concentrated its efforts on advancing its units deep into the
“gray” areas, constantly firing at Ukrainian positions following the tactics of “waging
a war of attrition”.

The biggest enemy activities were recorded in the vicinity of Avdiivka Shyrokine,
Shahta Dutivka, Novooleksandrivka, Verhnyotoretske, Maryinka and Krasnogorivka
where the enemy attempted to establish control over critical infrastructure.

In June-July and in December 2016, the most active fighting took place in the area
of Svitlodarsk duha (the regions of Luhansk, Svitlodarsk).

In particular, from 18 to 24 December 2016, near Svitlodarsk duha, illegal armed
groups supported by artillery were undertaking active offensive actions and tried to
oust Ukrainian units from their positions. The attacks of insurgents were repelled.
The enemy suffered losses and was pushed back leaving their positions. Ukrainian
units have moved forward by 2-3 km within the terms of the Minsk agreements, and
improved their tactical situation by taking a favourable position on the high ground.

19-22 December 2016, the enemy attempted to capture the lost ground and fired
onto Ukrainian defensive positions using artillery and mortars.

chapter 1


RESULTS OF THE ARMED FORCES OF UKRAINE REFORM IN 2016 AND PARTICIPATION IN THE ATO

During heavy fighting Ukrainian units held their occupied positions and in some
cases even improved their disposition on the ground.

Due to enemy offensive actions, Ukrainian defensive
positions required additional measures for engineering
improvements.

Therefore, the system of fortification barriers and
three defensive lines were built in the ATO area. Within
the first defensive line, the ATO forces maintained
37 battalion defence areas. In particular, 178 platoon
strongholds were built at the second and third lines of
defence. These strongholds were built by regional state
administrations.

To maintain law and order among the troops,
control the legality of their movement, ensure the safe
movements of military vehicles and prevent weapons
smuggling from the ATO area, the designated UAF units, together with the National
Police of Ukraine and National Guard of Ukraine performed their duties at joint
checkpoints in Zaporizhia, Dnipropetrovsk and Kharkiv, and at the railway stations,
bus stations and at points of embarkation.

Military Police units in cooperation with the National Police of Ukraine conducted
50 patrols daily, to maintain law and order in the deployment sites of military units, on
the streets and in public places.

Military Road Safety Inspection units in cooperation with the National Police units
were involved in organizing the activities of the Commandant Service. These included,
traffic control on supply routes, transportation support to military units travelling to
points of embarkation and support when moving to deployment locations.

The primary tasks for 2016 were the purchasing and delivery of new or modernized
weapons and equipment notably for the Armed Forces in the ATO; restoration and
repair of weapons and equipment either by UAF units or by defence industry companies
supporting the Armed Forces directly at the unit location in the ATO or recovering
equipment for repair back in the factory.

Implementation of these activities during the year made it possible to adopt new
materiel items, to purchase, upgrade and restore over 30 000 weapon systems, pieces
of equipment and property.

To account for the transportation provided to military units in the ATO by
humanitarian assistance measures, a procedure was established and adhered to.

In 2016, the allocated resources of **fuels and lubricants** have ensured mission
success in the ATO and resourced combat training of military units. It is estimated that
since the beginning of the year, the Armed Forces have spent 69 200 tons of fuel and
lubricants amounting to 2 044 million UAH to support the mission in the ATO and the
UAF.

During the year, we successfully assured food supplies to soldiers on operations in
the ATO.

In 2016, to improve soldier nutrition in the ATO, changes to the catering system[5]
were introduced (see more details in Section 3).

begun to operate directly in the ATO aiming to enhance food quality control. These
laboratories have examined 3 220 food products weighing 1 378 tonnes, 113 tonnes of
which were excluded from the supply chain and have been returned to suppliers.

Military units operating in the ATO received all of their clothing issue, including
winter clothing.

In autumn 2016, the Armed Forces of Ukraine received new military uniforms of a
higher quality than previous issues.

To meet the laundry and ablution requirements of military units in the ATO, the
Armed Forces bought 550 industrial washing machines, 40 domestic washing machines
and 7 mobile bath-washing facilities that provided individual washing for more than
55 000 people a week.

To perform the tasks of medical support in the ATO, the following activities were
undertaken:

  - 4 military mobile hospitals, a Joint Detachment and 2 Separate Ambulance
Companies were deployed;

  - 32 mobile medical and nursing teams, reinforcement groups for civilian
hospitals, 4 mobile medical support groups were created;

  - 164 Tactical Medical Instructors underwent training at the International
Peacekeeping and Security Centre near Yavoriv, Ukraine.

During the year, over 4 000 people were treated at hospitals, 119 soldiers were sent
for treatment abroad, 69 soldiers needed prosthetics, and 23 people were fitted with

new prostheses. More than 31 000 people have received medical and psychological
rehabilitation, including 7 800 people that have received physical rehabilitation under
the Program of Medical and Psychological and Social Rehabilitation for participants
of the ATO.

The railway network operated by Public Joint Stock Company (Ukrzaliznytsia)
provides transportation and logistics solutions to support military units in the ATO.

To improve the operational efficiency of railway stations to transport troops, the
necessary repairs and renewals have been made to 51 railway stations, serving as
points of embarkation, including 18 railway stations in the ATO. In particular, 216 000
soldiers, 38 000 weapons and pieces of military equipment and 182 tonnes of materiel
have been transported during 2016.

In addition, 60 300 tonnes of materiel have been transported by military transport
vehicles. The average daily run of road transport amounted up to 450 km, and
transportation of material assets amounted to 167 tonnes per day.

Logistics support units consisting of 24 truck convoys (140 vehicles and 20 trailers)
transported rockets, ammunition and other materiel to support all forces involved in the
ATO in the regions of Donetsk and Luhansk.

The combination of road transport, shipment distance, and the state of the road
network on the route, make it possible to transport required amounts of materiel from
the brigade rear command posts to designated units within 2 hours.

As a result of the implementation of these supply measures, the forces operating in
the ATO were correctly resourced to enable them to conduct the full range of military
missions. Thus, the operational effect of the Armed Forces was improved to enable them
to perform their duties of preventing the spread of the crisis, curbing armed conflict,
deterring further escalation, and repelling armed aggression against Ukraine.

Mine clearance activities in the ATO

An implementation plan was required for the mine clearance of railroads and
surrounding areas of power transmission lines, connecting the unified energy system
of Ukraine with the energy system in the ATO. This included in the 12 priority areas
in accordance with the Minsk Agreement and the Non-Technical Survey plan for the
liberated territories of the Donetsk and Luhansk regions. From 25 May 2016, demining
teams (25 to 40 people each) from the units of the Armed Forces, the State Special

Humanitarian mine clearance –activity, which is aimed to
eliminate threats from mines and explosives, left after war;
includes non-technical and technical inspection, clearing, marking
and documentation after clearing, communications with public
organizations on issues of mine clearance activity and transfer of
cleared territory to local authorities.

Non-technical inspection – with no technical means collected
and analysed data on presence, type, distribution and environment
of places with mines/explosive remnants of war, which helps to
more effectively determine mine/explosive remnants of war areas,
assist in prioritizing the clearance of territories as well as to take
decisions by providing evidence.


Transport Service, the State Emergency Service of
Ukraine and international organizations The HALO
Trust and DDG have been involved in the execution of
these mine clearance activities.

During this period, an area of over 2 785 hectares
was cleared by the mine clearance teams. Mine clearance
units have found and defused over 142 000 explosive
devices, checked and cleared approximately 896 km of
roads, 17 km of tracks, and 105 infrastructure facilities.

The MoD has implemented the use of IMSMA
software (developed by the Geneva International Centre
for Humanitarian Demining and used worldwide) by
which the data collection and analysis on humanitarian
mine clearance activities and other aspects of mine
action is being carried out for humanitarian purposes
(Note 1.3).

In 2016, the MoD efforts were aimed at improving internal control and implementing
a risk management system, to align with international standards and best practice of
NATO and EU member countries.

Priority activities of the Internal Audit Service in 2016 were the following:

  - corruption prevention measures provided for by the law;

  - identification of major corruption risks, monitoring measures to eliminate
misconduct and bringing those responsible to justice;

  - rapid response to administrative infringements, and provision of assistance to
military personnel and their families in obtaining adequate welfare provision;

  - necessary measures to improve internal control and risk management system.

The Measures for Preventing Corruption and Violation of the Law

The introduction of a new internal control and risk management system in 2016
prevented further loss or risk of loss of resources due to their inefficient use, in
comparison to the previous year. The risk was almost halved from 1.3% in 2015 to
0.7% in 2016.

As a result of the implementation into the decision making process of
recommendations made in the internal audits, additional revenue was provided and
unnecessary expenditure of nearly UAH 489 million was prevented (Table 1.3).

In addition, more than 2 000 draft legal acts and other documents of the MoD and
General Staff of the Armed Forces underwent audit. Appropriate recommendations
have been provided to improve activity in the following areas - financial and material
resource management, the paperwork process for the transfer of ownership of
property from the MoD to other entities, resource utilization, procurement, enterprise
reorganization, conclusion/termination of contracts, etc.

Risk-based planning has reduced the amount of unplanned and superfluous
activity. The systematic monitoring of the implementation of the audit
recommendations has helped to increase the efficiency of the internal audit and
increase the accountability of managers at all levels and address all identified
violations and risks (Table 1.4).

The implemented internal control measures have provided additional revenues
and expenditure savings amounting to UAH 57 million (in 2015 - UAH 51 million).

Thus, the total amount of identified and investigated violations (losses, damages etc.)
and risks, as well as prevented revenue losses and expenditure on superfluous activities
in 2016 amounted to UAH 7 889.2 million.

Nearly 640 appeals by citizens, of which 520 were received through the “hotline”,
were processed during the year. About 85 % of appeals from military personnel and
their families were related mainly to salaries and other payments to service personnel or
contained reports of violations. After reviewing appeals, 380 appeals were upheld; the
remaining appeals received further explanation or were declined. In addition, service
personnel received letters of recommendations to address the causes of problems, and
in some military units unscheduled audits were subsequently conducted.

To bring the internal audit in line with international standards, 287 internal auditors
improved their skills in 2016, including 175 people in internal audit through cooperation
with UK Ministry of Defence.

Internal control system development and risk management

Scientific, Methodological and Regulatory Manual for risk management and internal
control in the MoD and UAF in accordance with international standards have been
developed:

CORRUPTION



  - the standards for Internal Control in the Ministry of Defence of Ukraine and
Armed Forces of Ukraine and Guidelines for their application were approved[6];

  - the functions, powers and responsibilities of the heads of the MoD departments
supporting risk management and internal control were identified;

  - the Regulation on Internal Controls within the Armed Forces of Ukraine[7] was
approved;

  - risk assessment and risk management training was undertaken by more
than 1 200 military and civilian leaders responsible for the management of public
funds and property.

The Risk Management Plan of the MoD, and internal controls in the Departments of
the MoD contributed to the implementation of European approaches to administrative
responsibility and accountability of Managers and reduced risk level to tolerable.

To separate the internal audit function from payment, accounting and internal
control procedures, the following organizational and structural changes have been
implemented:

The Internal Audit and Financial Control Department of the Ministry of Defence of
Ukraine was reorganized into the Internal Audit Department of the Ministry of Defence
of Ukraine;

The internal control and risk management coordination, previously carried out by
the Internal Audit and Financial Control Department of the Ministry of Defence of
Ukraine, was assigned to the Chief Inspection of the Ministry of Defence of Ukraine.

Therefore, in 2016, the main stage of the internal control and risk management
reform within the MoD was completed.

In 2016, the efforts of the MoD and Armed Forces were focused on the implementation
of the State Anti-Corruption Policy in Ukraine for 2015-2017 (the Anti-Corruption
Strategy) and Anti-Corruption Program of the Ministry of Defence for 20152017, as well as prevention of corruption or corruption-related offenses, detection
and elimination of corruption risks, further implementation and development of
institutional mechanisms, including pilot reform projects.

To achieve these objectives the following measures have been implemented in 2016:

  - Establishment of the Commission on Monitoring and Coordination of the AntiCorruption Program;

  - reform in the following areas - procurement, logistics, clothing and food supply,
financial management, housing system, and reform of state-owned enterprises
was initiated;

  - territorial units on the prevention and detection of corruption in the Armed
Forces were created;

  - taking into account the experience of NATO member states to improve the system
of benefits and minimize corruption risks, the Main Department for material
support and maintenance of the Armed Forces of Ukraine was established;

  - The Tender Committee of the Ministry of Defence was reorganized. To avoid
fraud in public procurement the public e-procurement system, ProZorro, was

Ministry of Defence of Ukraine and the General Staff of the Armed Forces of Ukraine
on defence planning and financial management in the Defence sphere (UK), and also
elected the Secretary of the Committee – Oksana Gorbach, a representative of the “Strat
Com-Ukraine” communication centre.

Cooperation with the Independent Anti-Corruption Committee of Defence (NACO),
which is a joint international and Ukrainian monitoring group supported by a Ukrainebased Secretariat and UK-based Transparency International Defence and Security
program, was established.

1 395 draft legal acts where audited for signs of corruption (Diagram 1.5), and 162
appeals relating to the prevention of corruption were processed during the year.

The following events were held in the National Defence University of Ukraine
named after Ivan Chernyakhovsky:

#### COMMAND AND CONTROL SYSTEM
 OF THE ARMED FORCES, THEIR STRUCTURE AND MANPOWER

n 2016 during the period of crisis, the command and control (C2) system of the Armed Forces provided
### IC2 not only over force formations in the ATO but also at permanent locations. It has transformed

to increase the effectiveness and quality of C2, meet needs of the Armed Forces and implemented
corresponding NATO doctrine and standard.


IMPROVEMENT OF
COMMAND AND
CONTROL SYSTEM
OF THE ARMED
FORCES


In 2016 planned development of the C2 system of the Armed Forces was continued,
as well as the increase of capabilities of military authorities, improvement of
effectiveness of C2 over the Armed Forces within the ATO and throughout the
country.

Main efforts were focused on:

  - re-equipment of the field C2 components of communications system,
reconnaissance and surveillance systems of the defence forces with digital means
of interference and protection levels, which correspond to NATO standards;

  - development of the core of the automated C2 system of the Armed Forces of
Ukraine;

  - development of the Air Force C2 systems by bringing into service automated C2
centres for aviation and air defence;

  - formation of units capable of operating with the civil and military air-traffic
management system of Ukraine.

Based on the needs of the Armed Forces and taking into account lessons learned
from the ATO, elements of the Armed Forces C2 system were improved. In particular,
the formation of a task force which consists of three tactical groups, namely “Luhansk”,
“Donetsk” and “Mariupol”, was completed in the ATO. Their responsibilities, ORBAT
and arrangements for coordination, as well as control and overall support procedures
were determined.

Transfer of the Armed Forces command and control system to digital means
of communication continued as well as the equipment of mobile command posts
with modern means of communication. Selected components were connected to
telecommunications networks of special purpose and general use. The road map for
the development of data infrastructure was approved.[1] Capabilities of information
protection system and cyber defence of information and telecommunications
system of the MoD and the UAF, increased. A protected system enabled the transfer
to electronic document management within the MoD. In the ATO in Donetsk and
Luhansk regions, a video surveillance system was introduced and its integration
with the deployed combat forces command, control and communications system was
initiated.

During the year the development of the Automated Control System of the Armed
Forces continued, which allowed the UAF to:

                - bring into service and put into operation 10 automatic, stationary Air Defence
systems[2];

               - launch a protected and automated system for information accounting of Armed
Forces personnel, run by the General Staff at a “Classifi ed” level;

              - develop a protected electronic document management system of the MoD
encompassing all levels down to the Operational Commands of the Armed
Forces;

              - initiate the development of an automated combat C2 system for the Armed
Forces.

At the end of 2016, the C2 system of the Armed Forces included (Diagram 2.1):

of Ukraine (Patronage service);

               - Directorate of Corruption Detection and Prevention.

Using personnel management principles of NATO-member countries, a professional
civil staff of the Ministry of Defence was created. –An impartial assessment of all
personnel was carried out and their functional responsibilities were reviewed. Specific
functions of the Minister were delegated to his deputies, and from deputies to heads of
departments. The authority to make decisions in their respective fields was delegated
together with the responsibility for output. Meanwhile regulatory and legal framework
was rewritten, new regulations on structural units were approved, and obsolete
departmental regulations were recognized as obsolete.

As a result of optimization, the MoD was reorganised, and efficiency was increased.
The level of compatibility with defence agencies of NATO-member countries improved,
while communications with other government departments were also enhanced.

**The General Staff undertook a review to clarify the objectives, functions and**
powers of its departments. In addition, they commenced a phased reorganisation process
to align with the J (Joint) staffing structure and training and standards, as utilised by
the armed forces of NATO-member countries. Particularly six organizational reviews
were conducted.

Structure of the Main Operations Directorate of the General Staff (J3) was modified
to conform to this new structure of the Armed Forces.

Three organization units were restructured:

               - Directorate General for Moral Affairs for the Armed Forces – into Directorate
General for psychological and moral support of the Armed Forces;

               - Central Department for the Training and Daily Activities of the Armed Forces –
into Directorate General for the training of the Armed Forces (J7);

              - Central Department for Information Protection and Cryptology – into Central
Department for the State Secret and Information Protection.

Two organizational units were restructured: Directorate General for Defence and
Mobilization Planning and Directorate General for Personnel Management (J1).

Structure of the administration of the MoD and the General Staff in 2016 is given
in Annex 3.

Implementation of NATO principles and approaches continued within all C2
organizations at the _operational level. Organization and establishment of the Joint_
Operational Headquarters of the Armed Forces was improved, which enabled an
increase in the effectiveness of planning the engagement and the management of jointforce and interagency task forces during operations.

A Reserve Force was established to strengthen the existing Land Component forces
in support of the defence of Ukraine against possible increased aggression.

“East” Air Command Headquarters was additionally established within the Air
Force. After a range of measures, taken to increase its operational capabilities, a number
of military units will be assigned to its command.

Organizational measures, directed towards the restructuring of Special Operations
Forces Command, were accomplished.

Tactical level of command

15 crews among naval personnel, whose ships remain in the temporarily occupied
territory of the Autonomous Republic of Crimea, were disbanded. Personnel were
reassigned to other ships based on their specialisations and professional skills. A
separate artillery brigade was formed, as well as rocket artillery regiment, independent
Marine Corps battalion and Naval Institute of the Armed Forces of Ukraine of the
National University “Odessa Maritime Academy”.

Within the High Mobility Assault Forces, air mobile brigades were restructured into
air assault brigades, which enabled them to increase their firepower.

During the year the C2 system provided continuous and sustainable management of
the Armed Forces in relation to the performance of daily activities and service in the
ATO, as well as effective response to the changing threat environment.

Development of the organizational structure of the Armed Forces was aimed to form
a combat organization capable of performing defence missions, protecting national
interests, sovereignty and the territorial integrity of Ukraine.

The development of the structure of the Armed Forces was based on the following:

  - Consideration of the principles and approaches of the Armed Forces of NATOmember countries;

  - Transfer of Command and Control system to the J-structure;

              - augmentation of manpower, and increase of the number of combat units of the
Armed Forces of Ukraine and improvements in their combat effectiveness.

During 2016, 89 military units were converted to standardize staff and 3 brigade
staff, 4 regiments and 12 battalions were established.

At the end of 2016 the total strength of the Armed Forces amounted to 250 000
people, including 204 000 servicemen and 46 000 civil servants of the Armed Forces
(Annex 3).

WITH WEAPONS
AND MILITARY
EQUIPMENT


In 2016 the MoD developed the State Target Defence Program on the Development
of Weapons and Military Equipment up to 2020[1], as an integrated middle-term
planning document on planning the development of weapons and military equipment
of formations established in accordance with laws of Ukraine.

The program includes re-equipment of the Armed Forces, National Guard and the
State Border Service with the latest refurbished variants of weapons, military and
specialized hardware, which will ensure the effective performance of defence tasks.

In 2016 the main effort was focused on the supply of the Armed Forces with
weapons, which influence combat capabilities of military units, the improvement of
high-tech variants of weapons and military equipment of the Armed Forces to support
the ATO.

Under these conditions, 93% of allocated funds were
spent on the refurbishment of existing and procurement
of new weapons and military equipment, while other
7% on financing the research and development works
encompassing documentation development, prototype
production or conduct of trials.

The implementation of the State target defence
program on the development of weapons and military
equipment in 2016 shows the following results:

                    - 20 variants of weapons and military equipment
were made operational, namely BMM-4C armoured

RESULTS OF THE DEVELOPMENT, REFURBISHMENT, SUPPLY, RENEWAL...

The reform of the supply chain for military uniforms and personal equipment is at
its final stage. During 2015-2016, 17 NATO documents were introduced into the military
uniforms and personal equipment supply system, 16 of which – are NATO military
standards and one military guide. 53 technical specifications and 9 technical descriptions,
that regulate the supply requirements for uniforms, individual protective equipment and
other components of military uniforms and personal equipment, were adopted.

The implementation plan was developed to bring the quality requirements and supply
of military uniforms and personal equipment of the Armed Forces into compliance with
NATO standards.

A pilot project on the automation of the supply and accounting of military uniforms
and personal equipment on bases and in warehouses, was introduced.

During the year, the improvement of the legal framework concerning the supply of
military uniforms and personal equipment was carried out and included:

               - procedure of providing the Armed Forces with military uniforms and personal
equipment in peacetime and during times of conflict, was legally regulated[8];

              - terms and conditions of compensation payments provided to service personnel
of the UAF for uniform and personal equipment deficiencies or non-issue were
regulated[9];

              - new military uniforms with improved performance were received from industry
and delivered to the UAF;

               - new design of daily and parade uniforms, which were presented during a military
parade in honour of the 25th anniversary of the Independence of Ukraine, was
developed;

               - seven mobile ablution and laundry facilities were introduced into service and
delivered to the UAF.

In 2016 military units of High Mobility Assault Forces of the Armed Forces
conducted trials of the new military uniforms and personal equipment (winter hats,
neck gaiters, winter shirts and underpants, insulated socks, fleece items of uniform,
cold weather and winter gloves, winter wind- and water-resistant outer layers, TOP-D
bulletproof helmet, knee and elbow protectors) and proposals for their refurbishment
were taken into account.

Financial resources in the amount of UAH 1 664 million, were assigned for military
uniforms and personal equipment in 2016, but this only made it possible to buy combat
uniforms.

Implementation of NATO standards within the UAF and other components of the
defence forces is specified by strategic defence documents of Ukraine as well as
NATO-Ukraine Partnership Goals.

In accordance with the Military Doctrine of Ukraine, restructuring of the Armed
Forces is determined to be a principal task of the military policy of Ukraine, directed
towards the achievement of operational and technical interoperability with forces of
NATO-member countries as well as compliance with EU and NATO standards on
activities, allocation of functions and main tasks.

RESULTS OF THE DEVELOPMENT, REFURBISHMENT, SUPPLY, RENEWAL...

In 2016, to reform the system of standardization in the area of defence of Ukraine
a unifi ed military standardization body was established, which was responsible for the
general management and coordination of command and control organizations in charge
of NATO standards implementation.

The Ministry of Defence and the Armed Forces determined a mechanism of
obtaining, accounting, preserving and implementing NATO standards. The above
mentioned procedures are specifi ed in the Temporary Instruction on the organization
of work in the Ministry of Defence of Ukraine and the Armed Forces of Ukraine on
NATO standards implementation (Diagram 3.3), designed to meet the requirements of
NATO AAP-03 "Development, maintenance and management of NATO standardization
documents" Joint publication.

DISPOSAL OF
MISSILES, MUNITIONS
AND ROCKET FUEL
COMPONENTS


Implementation of NATO standards provides gradual augmentation of combat
effectiveness of the Armed Forces and development of interoperability with the armed
forces of leading countries. In addition it furthers the improvement of the effective use
of state resources within the defence sphere, improvement of the training system of
military units and subdivisions, which act as part of multinational military formations
as well as growth of authority of Ukraine on international level.

Disposal of missiles, munitions and rocket fuel components, unsuitable for further
use and maintenance, remains an important aspect to minimize the real threat of
man-made ecological catastrophes and ensure safe operation of weapons and military
equipment in peace-time and during times of conflict.

Disposal of missiles and munitions

In 2016, UAH 30.5 million, 9% of planned expenditure, was assigned to implement
State Target Defence Program measures oriented towards the disposal of conventional
munitions, unsuitable for the further use and maintenance, in 2008-2017 (State
Program for Disposal).

Munitions disposal procedures were also financed from international assistance
(Table 3.8).

In 2016 only unserviceable missiles and munitions from the inventory of the Land
Forces, Air Forces and engineer corps, surplus Class II munitions as well as types of
weapons and military equipment, which were taken out of service and are not expected
to be operational again, were passed for disposal.

According to the Implementation Agreement between the Cabinet of Ministers
and NATO on maintenance and service of the disposal of small arms, light weapons,
conventional munitions and PFM-1-type anti-personnel mines, ratified by the Verkhovna
Rada of Ukraine, nearly 5 tons of munitions, among them 107 tons (643 032 items) of
PFM-1-type anti-personnel mines were disposed in 2016 at the expense of international
assistance in framework of the Trust Fund. In total, over 5 700 tons of munitions were
disposed during the year (Table 3.8).

of munitions were disposed (contribution of international assistant amounted to EUR
7 million (UAH 135 535 million), contribution of Ukraine – UAH 34 376 million).

In total, according to results of the State Disposal Program in 2008-2016, nearly 233
500 tons of conventional munitions, unsuitable for further use and maintenance, were
disposed of, totalling 51% of the total Program numbers (454 800 tons).

Disposal of Liquid Rocket Fuel Components

At the beginning of 2016, 442 tons of surplus liquid rocket fuel components were
stored at storage depots of the Armed Forces, 45 tons of which were transferred to the
State Space Agency of Ukraine for further disposal.

Though the Ministry of Defence made an effort to dispose surplus liquid rocket
fuel components, the disposal failed due to the lack of license for disposal owned by
Ukrainian enterprises, which excluded any need to allocate a contract through a tender
process.

No measures were taken by the international community to provide financial or
logistic support for the disposal of surplus liquid rocket fuel components (Table 3.9).

### Sand material resources of training ranges have ensured the achievement of the primary purpose of

the Armed Forces training in 2016 – the Armed Forces and other components of the defence forces
ensured resistance to armed aggression against Ukraine.


FORCES TRAINING
SUPPORT


In 2015, the Ministry of Defence provided adequate funding for training activities;
compared to the previous year, the funding of the Armed Forces training has almost
doubled (Table 4.1).


**Table 4.1. Funding of the Armed Force’s Training in 2014-2016, UAH million**

**2014** **2015** **2016**

307.0 307.0 **100** 885.9 885.9 **100** 1 718.2 1 718.2 **100**

Taking into account the current needs of the Armed Forces and the experience of
previous years, all funds have been allocated for the financing of respective areas (Table
4.2). These measures significantly increased financial allocations for combat training,
proportionally increased funding for staff and physical training. The list of expenditures
also included participation in multinational exercises.

Building the training capacity of the Armed Forces was another priority direction
in 2016. By increasing 3.7 times the amount of targeted allocations (in 2015 – about
UAH 23.2 million), the field training capability has been significantly increased. This
approach made it possible to expand training areas and training centres, and promote
the practical approach of the Armed Forces to training. Furthermore, the unique training
facilities to train military specialists have been established. In particular, the Training
Centre of the Special Operations Forces (in Berdychiv) was launched; the Training
Centre and Cadre at the International Peacekeeping and Security Centre (in Yavoriv),
and Training Range “Shyrokolanivskyy” were improved.

ARMED FORCES’ TRAINING


chapter 4


RESULTS OF ARMED
FORCES TRAINING


Developing military capabilities to perform assigned tasks in the ATO remained the
main task of the Armed Forces training in 2016.

The main efforts were aimed at ensuring:

  - combat units training incorporating personnel from the operational reserve;

  - readiness to participate in multinational exercises, operations to maintain peace
and security;

  - smooth transition to NATO training standards.

Combat experience gained in the ATO led to further development of the regulatory
framework for the Armed Forces training. A new concept for the Armed Forces training[1],
which defines the purpose, principles and training components was introduced. From
now on, all military management bodies, combat units and the reserve force of the
Armed Forces, higher military educational establishments and military training units
of higher educational establishments, research institutions and training centres are
required to plan and conduct training using a single format adapted to the best practices
of NATO member-countries.

Military authorities training

The General Staff of the Armed Forces has specified the major tasks for training of
command and control organizations and for increasing their operational capabilities
in 2016 with respect to:

  - planning application and management of the Armed Forces from stationary and
mobile command posts;

  - combat missions involving units of other military formations, and specialpurpose law enforcement agencies;

  - ensuring the required level of morale, psychological stability of service
personnel, their readiness to perform assigned tasks and effectively conduct
combat operations;

  - training of personnel, which is a part of the operational reserve;

  - comprehensive support of service personnel in different environments according
to the available resources.

During the year, 298 operational training events were held across command
and control organizations. The most significant contribution to the development of
operational capabilities of C2 organizations was conducted as follows:

  - strategic command and staff exercises - Spring Thunder 2016 (March-April), and
Frontier 2016 (October);

  - series of staff exercises (April-May);

  - strategic command-staff war game (June);

  - series of staff exercises Summer Storm 2016, and South Wind 2016 (July);

  - command staff exercise (September).

The combination of these measures contributed to improve strategic planning and
deployment of forces for counter-offensive and raid operations, to determine the actual
composition of the minimum defence capabilities necessary to repel armed aggression,
and to review options for their use to perform operational tasks in probable scenarios.


1 Joint Order of the Ministry of Defence of Ukraine and the General Staff of the Armed Forces of Ukraine “On Approval of the Armed Forces of Ukraine Training
Concept” # 95 as of February 22, 2016.


-----

ARMED FORCES’ TRAINING

In addition, the ability of all command and control organizations to carry out planning,
manage troops and organize cooperation at all levels in the new organizational structure
has been validated.


**Note 4.1. Practical activities conducted in the**
course of Rubizh 2016 exercise


Strategic command and staff exercise Frontier 2016 was a critical
element of operational training. Military command and control bodies
confi rmed their ability to manage forces in strategic operations and to
repel armed aggression. Along with this, the troops performed a number of
combat assigned tasks.

Moreover, 17 command and control posts of different levels were
deployed during these exercises, involving more than 7 500 people. A total
of 46 practical events (Note 4.1) involved 32 units, over 1 900 people and
about 650 weapons and military equipment (Figure 4.1).

ARMED FORCES’ TRAINING

For the first time in the history of the Armed Forces of Ukraine, Army Aviation units
performed a flight tactical exercise including night live firing and engineering units
provided a bridge crossing over a length of 560 metres.

Forces combat training

The continued participation of the Armed Forces in the ATO with their concurrent
training, led to the developing of new combat tactics and procedures. During 2016,
a number of studies, including with officers of different ranks, non-commissioned
officers and graduates of higher military educational institutions were conducted.

Mobile training teams were involved to train
personnel who are involved in the ATO. These mobile
teams included the best instructors and the practical
training activities were organized directly in combat
positions in the ATO. During the year, 185 such groups
were involved and contributed to improving the skills
and abilities of personnel whilst deployed on combat
operations. In military training, the primary focus was
on ensuring the readiness of military units, including:

                                       - obtaining timely intelligence for destroying enemy
positions involving artillery intelligence, army aviation,
unmanned aircraft systems and electronic warfare;

                                       - different ways to defeat enemy strongholds by
artillery units (artillery strikes at the targeted locations (direct fire, high-angle
fire) and echeloned fire);

                - close combat attacks, missions at extremely low altitudes (up to 5 meters), night
air combat operations involving all weapon systems;

               - air defence reconnaissance within a designated sector or area;

             - cohesion among all crew members supporting AN/TPQ (Radar system)
counterfire target acquisition radars and unmanned aircraft systems.


**Note 4.2. During 2016 training was provided to:**



- 13 brigades – in Land Forces;

- 210 crews – in Air Force;

- 3 ship groups (ship blocking group, home station guard task
force, maritime rescue team), 28 ships (boats) and support
vessels, one brigade – in Naval Forces

- 4 brigades – in High Mobility Assault Forces;

- 13 units – in Special Operations Forces.


The overall stabilization of the operational situation
in the ATO contributed to the efficiency of combat
training. During the year, more than 5 000 events were
held (almost 27% more than last year). In total, 20
brigade exercises, more than 220 battalion exercises,
more than 640 company tactical exercises, 10 flight and
tactical squadron exercises, more than 1 000 platoon
live firing exercises and 36 000 parachute jumps have
been conducted in the Armed Forces since the beginning
of the year (Appendix 5).


MULTINATIONAL
EXERCISES IN THE
GENERAL ARMED
FORCES TRAINING
SYSTEM


Overall, since the beginning of training in 2016, the
Armed Forces have provided training for 18 brigades, 376 air crews, 3 ship groups, 28
ships (boats) and support vessels, 13 special purpose units (Note 4.2).

In addition, five battalions have been trained according to NATO standards within
the framework of the Joint Multinational Training Group-Ukraine (JMTG-U).

In 2016, the main purpose of UAF units participation in multinational exercises was
the application of methods, training standards and NATO military experience and
using all resources available to build-up their own combat capabilities and develop
interoperability with the armed forces of NATO.

ARMED FORCES’ TRAINING

The distinctive feature of this year’s multinational exercises became their updated
scenarios. Instead of peacekeeping operations typically used in previous years the
exercises focussed on stabilization activities. In view of the modern trends of politicalmilitary situation development, the tactics of the Armed Forces actions in hybrid warfare
started to be developed.

The active application of combat operations simulation modelling systems became
meaningful for national units in 2016 multinational exercises. It made it possible to
increase insight and provide for introduction of NATO standards in the functional activity
of Ukrainian soldiers and facilitate the development of interoperability.

Participation in multinational exercises contributed to western operational standards
being introduced into the UAF as well as modern practices and approaches becoming
assimilated through practice.

The practice of sharing experience, primarily combat experience, received further
development. Ukrainian experience of conducting military reform under the conditions
of combat activities and countering modern hybrid threats, the issues of battle-field
infrastructure establishment and functioning were of the most interest to partner-countries.

Participation in implementation of the Operational
Capabilities Concept (OCC)

Substantial changes have been achieved in the sphere of international military
cooperation related to participation in the Operational Capabilities Concept Evaluation
and Feedback Programme (OCC E&F).

During 2016, 3 evaluations of interoperability of units of the UAF with corresponding
units of NATO member-states were held under the OCC E&F. In addition, OCC E&F
mechanisms were applied to improve troop training and increase the level of individual
training standards of service personnel according to their specialisation.


As the result of conducted activities three Ukrainian units (Il-76 MD transport
aircraft, An-26 Vita aeromedical evacuation aircraft and frigate “Hetman Sahaidachny”)
were evaluated at the appropriate levels within the OCC and deemed able to participate
in NATO-led exercises and operations and be involved as part of multinational high

Improvement of the human resourcing system
of the Armed Forces

In 2016, the main personnel body of the Armed Forces, the Main Directorate of
Personnel of the General Staff of the Armed Forces of Ukraine, was transformed to
align with the J-structure, similar to those adopted at the headquarters of the armed
forces of NATO member states, which allowed the rebrigading of its functions and
authorities.

The Main Directorate of Defence and Mobilization Planning of the General Staff of
the Armed Forces of Ukraine, the mobilization department, handed over responsibility
for ensuring the manning of the Armed Forces with reserve personnel, organizing the
conscription of reservists, and maintaining military records in the military command
and military units, to the Main Directorate of Personnel.

Appropriate changes have been initiated regarding the transformation of the
headquarters of Services and operational commands into a "J-structure" to align with
NATO member states.

Measures have been taken to bring the organizational structure of the personnel
management system in line with the "J1-function" and create a unified management
hierarchy in the structure of the personnel bodies to satisfy the needs of the Armed
Forces in the recruitment of professionally trained personnel.

The reorganisation was initiated to bring the ratio of officer categories, by rank,
more closely to that of NATO member states.

Results of the Armed Forces recruitment

The main efforts in 2016 were focused on maintaining the required level of military
personnel within combat units such as, highly mobile landing forces, Special
Operations Forces, reconnaissance units and units of the land component, as well as
the recruitment for the main command posts.

As the result of the work:

              - more than 69 000 people were accepted for contract-based military service
(7 500 officers and 61 500 soldiers and sergeants);

              - The release of about 75 000 service personnel, called up during the partial
mobilization (7 700 officers and 67 300 soldiers and sergeants) was completed.

service under the officers’ contract, including 4 200
people from the reserve, which is 5 times higher than
in 2015. 2 900 officers were assigned to primary
positions.

In general, due to conscription, officers’ graduation
from military schools and appointing sergeants with
higher education and practical combat experience to
officer positions, the number of the service personnel
for this category increased by 10 100 personnel, more
than 27% (Figure 5.3).

service (Figure 5.4).

It was possible to increase the volume of attracting
citizens for military contract-based service primarily by
raising salaries, simplifying of contractual procedures,
streamlining the military service terms, establishing
effective interaction with state authorities, carrying out
a powerful advertising campaign to popularize military
service in the Armed Forces.

In addition, the improvement of military personnel
contract-based recruitment was facilitated by the
introduction of the following changes in regulations:

  - regulation of the procedure for accepting
foreigners and persons without citizenship for
military service;

  - reviewing approaches to attracting women to
military service and assigning them not only to
staff positions, but also to command and combat
positions[5].

chapter 5


The qualification of officers, scientific and pedagogical workers and civil servants
is increased at the National University of Defence of Ukraine named after Ivan
Chernyakhovsky and at HMEI through residential courses.

NCOs improve their qualifications in military NCO colleges (military departments
of civilian colleges) before being appointed to higher positions.

Military doctors and pharmacists are improving their qualifications at the Ukrainian
Military Medical Academy.

The basis for professional development programs is directly related to the functional
duties of personnel. Training courses are from 1 week to 3 months.

Foreign language training is carried out at the National University of Defence of
Ukraine named after Ivan Chernyakhovsky and in HMEI at language training courses
with a 3-4 month training period.

To reduce costs and improve the efficiency of a professional development system,
it is planned to introduce distance learning in HMEI.

In 2016, about 3 200 people completed training courses.

Personnel training

The main condition for the Armed Forces professionalization is to ensure the manning

Force training and preparation of the UAF for operational duties as part of the EU
Battle Group was carried out in 2016. Units of the Armed Forces of Ukraine trained
with "Helbrok" Battle Group, Visegrad countries and the Lithuanian national support
element of EU UK-led Battle Group.

Representatives of the Ministry of Defence of Ukraine and the General Staff of the
Armed Forces of Ukraine took part in activities within the framework of the "Eastern
Partnership" EU initiative.

As part of this initiative and with the support of the European Security and Defence
College training of military personnel and employees of the UAF on the orientation
courses on the EU Common Security and Defence Policy (CSDP) in Ukraine (Kyiv)
and abroad (Brussels, Minsk and Tbilisi) was conducted.

In addition, a further orientation course on CSDP was conducted at the educational
centre of international peacekeeping of the National University of Defence of Ukraine
in October 2016. It was attended by 300 people.

The cooperation between the Ministry of Defence of Ukraine and European Defence
Agency was developed.

Partnership with NATO, the activities within the framework of the Annual
Ukraine - NATO National Program for 2016

From the first days of Russia’s aggression against Ukraine, NATO has consistently
adhered to a clear position of complete and unconditional support of the sovereignty
and territorial integrity of Ukraine. NATO does not recognize the illegal annexation
of Crimea by Russia and condemns violence in eastern Ukraine, initiated by Russia
and supported by mercenaries and local separatists. NATO supports the suspension of

practical civil and military cooperation with Russia and
provides maximum possible support to Ukraine.

In 2016, condemning acts of Russia’s aggression
against Ukraine, NATO continued demonstrating its
commitment to the Distinctive Partnership with Ukraine
and support of security sector reform and defence of
Ukraine in the framework of the Ukraine - NATO Joint
Working Group. This addresses high level defence
reform and mechanisms of review and planning process,
and provides an advisory mission at NATO offices in
Kyiv. NATO members support the transformation of
the defence and security institutions of Ukraine, into
a modern and efficient organization under civilian and
democratic oversight, which would be able to provide
reliable deterrence of aggression and defence against military threats.
One of the most important practical results of cooperation between Ukraine and
NATO in 2016 was the completion of a comprehensive security and defence review, the
approval of the security and defence sector concept and the Strategic Defence Bulletin
of Ukraine developed with the support of NATO experts. In the Joint Statement of the
NATO-Ukraine Commission and adopted at the NATO Summit in Warsaw on July 9,
2016, the allies welcomed the Strategic Defence Bulletin as a roadmap for defence
reform in Ukraine. Alliance Advisors actively participate in working groups of the
Reform Committee of Ukraine's Defence Ministry and UAF. In addition, NATO experts
were involved in the elaboration of the State Program of the Armed Forces of Ukraine
for 2020 and logistics doctrine, as well as other defence reform documents.
The dynamics of the political-military dialogue between Ukraine and NATO has
reached an unprecedented intensity.
In the framework of consultations with NATO on the implementation of defence
reform plans for Ukraine, a delegation headed by the Minister of Defence of Ukraine
took part in two meetings of the – NATO-Ukraine Commission in March and June 2016.
Two meetings of the NATO - Ukraine Military Committee (January, May) with Chief
of General Staff of the Armed Forces of Ukraine were held. The issues of increasing
the defence capability and development of Ukraine Armed Forces capabilities were
discussed during these meetings.
In 2016 the Ministry of Defence of Ukraine took part in two meetings of the Ukraine

- NATO Joint Working Group working on high level defence reform and two meetings
of the Joint Working Group on defence technical cooperation.
The Deputy Minister of Defence of Ukraine took part in the Conference of national
directors of arms in November.
An important milestone of Ukraine - NATO cooperation was the adoption of a
Comprehensive Assistance Package (CAP) for Ukraine by the Heads of States and
Governments of NATO members during the Warsaw summit. The CAP aims to
strengthen, expand and organize NATO support for Ukraine and to strengthen Ukraine’s
ability to ensure its own safety and to introduce national security institutions reform
based on the Euro-Atlantic standards and practices. The CAP includes 40 activities of
targeted assistance in key areas.
A large part of NATO and NATO member states assistance is provided to Ukraine
via NATO Trust Fund programs included in the CAP.

Fund) headed by the Deputies of the Minister of Defence of Ukraine. In addition to
representatives, from the MOD and the General Staff of the Armed Forces of Ukraine,
experts from other ministries and central bodies of the executive branch of Ukraine,
advisors from NATO and representatives of volunteer organizations participate in the
work of these groups.

Implementation of an Individual Partnership Program between
Ukraine and NATO for 2016


chapter 7


An Individual Partnership Program is one of the main mechanisms for the practical
implementation of military cooperation between the Armed Forces of Ukraine and
NATO and the achievement of the necessary level of compatibility with NATO.

In 2016, within the framework of the Individual Partnership Program between
Ukraine and NATO, 399 representatives of the Armed Forces of Ukraine took part in
213 military cooperation activities abroad (Table 7.1).

**Table 7.1. Activities of military cooperation abroad**

**Activities** **Number of activities** **Number of participants**

Training courses, on-the-job training 115 167

Conferences, meetings, seminars, symposiums 70 87

Command-staff exercises 28 145

**Total** **213** **399**

The main efforts of cooperation of the Armed Forces of Ukraine with NATO within
the framework of the Individual Partnership Program between Ukraine and NATO
during 2016 were focused on the following priority areas:

  - creation and development of the Special Operations Forces of the Armed Forces
of Ukraine; restoration and development of the operational capabilities of the
Navy of the Armed Forces of Ukraine;

  - improvement of C2;

  - further development of logistical and logistic support systems (introduction of
an integrated logistics system) and the introduction of a medical support system
in accordance with NATO standards;

  - development of capabilities in the field of strategic communications;

  - implementation of NATO standards.

Cooperation in other international and regional security organizations and
initiatives. Cooperation with the UN and the OSCE

During 2016, Ukrainian troops actively participated in two **NATO missions: the**
national contingent (40 members) of the KFOR multinational force in Kosovo, and
national staff (10 personnel) in the NATO Training and Advisory Mission "Strong
Support" in the Islamic Republic of Afghanistan.

In the ATO in the East of Ukraine, the OSCE plays an important role, in particular
the Special Monitoring Mission (SMM), which was deployed in 2014 at the request of
the Government of Ukraine. The main goal of the SMM is to facilitate the cessation
of military aggression as soon as possible, to establish peace, stability and security in
our State.

It should be mentioned that in addition to the main tasks for conducting continuous
monitoring and reporting on the fulfilment of the provisions of the Minsk Agreements
by the parties to the conflict, the SMM is in fact the only international instrument by
which it is possible to provide the world community with timely, accurate and impartial
information about events, which occur in the ATO. in certain areas of the Donetsk and
Luhansk regions.

Pursuing further integration into the European community, Ukraine considers the
activities within the framework of regional cooperation of the Council of Defence

Ministers of South-Eastern Europe (CDM SEE) as a significant contribution to the
European security system, which allows maintaining peace and stability in SouthEastern Europe.

The Deputy Minister of Defence of Ukraine on European Integration participated
in the jubilee 20th meeting of the CDM SEE in Rome,
and updated foreign media on Russia's annexation of
Crimea and the ongoing Russian aggression in the East
of Ukraine.

Also, the MOD representatives of Ukraine took part
in the meetings of the Coordinating Committee and the
Military-Political Guidance Committee of the CDM
SEE. During the meetings they discussed the state of
implementation of projects within the framework of
the CDM SEE, the military-political situation in the
East of Ukraine in connection with Russian aggression
and summed up the activities of the multinational
peacekeeping forces of South-Eastern Europe.

Regarding regional cooperation, in 2016 the headquarters of the joint LithuanianPolish-Ukrainian Brigade achieved full operating capability as is ready to participate
in international peacekeeping and security operations.


PEACEKEEPING
ACTIVITIES


In 2016, about 1 000 servicemen of the UAF, consisting of three national contingents
and national personnel, participated in 10 International Peacekeeping and Security
Operations (IPSO) under the UN and NATO and as part of joint peacekeeping forces
in 8 countries and in the Abyei area (Figure 7.3). The leadership of international
security organizations appreciated the role of the Ukrainian peacekeepers.

During 2016, three planned rotations of national contingents were organized and
conducted and 43 persons of national staff were included in the IPSO.

Due to the stabilization of the situation in Côte d'Ivoire and Liberia, under the
provisions of UN Security Council Resolutions 2226, 2239, part of the 56th Separate
Helicopter Detachment of the UAF, was withdrawn from the Cote d’Ivoire. Additionally,
the 56th Separate Helicopter Detachment was downsized in 2016 but continues to
operate as part of the United Nations Mission in Liberia.

During 2016 national contingents and personnel successfully performed tasks as part
of the IPSO and represented the Armed Forces of Ukraine in the international arena.
Despite the difficult political-military and socio-economic situation in the country, it
was possible to ensure the functioning of national contingents and personnel at a high
level, to maintain the proper level of representation of the UAF within the IPSO with
the minimum necessary amount of material and financial resources.

ARMS
CONTROL


Ukraine is a consistent supporter of the course of global nuclear disarmament and
non-proliferation, full and timely fulfilment of international obligations in the field
of arms control.

In the context of annexation of the Autonomous
Republic of Crimea by the Russian Federation and an
armed conflict that continues on the territory of Donetsk
and Luhansk regions, Ukraine takes all possible measures
to find a peaceful solution to the situation. In particular,
the mechanisms of international treaties in the field of
arms control are actively used.

In this context, implementation of important
documents, such as the Treaty on Conventional Armed
Forces in Europe (TCAFE), the Open Skies Treaty
(OST), the Vienna Document 2011 on confidencebuilding measures and security (VD-2011), bilateral
intergovernmental agreements (BIA) on additional
measures to strengthen confidence and security with
neighbouring countries (Slovak Republic, the Republic of Poland, the Republic of
Belarus, Wen Ria and Romania), as well as active participation in building confidence
and security in the Black Sea region is an important contribution of the UAF in the
creation of a positive foreign policy image of the State.

During 2016 foreign inspection groups carried out 58 control measures in the
territory of Ukraine. Participating in the arms control process, Ukraine conducted
59 monitoring activities with signatories of international treaties during the year
(Figure 7.4).

During 2016, Ukraine continued to use the mechanisms of the Vienna Document
and adopted six additional control measures under Section Ten of this document in the
southern and eastern regions of Ukraine with a view to monitoring the development
of the military and political situation in our country and to inform the international
community about real military activities of the Armed Forces and other Defence
organisations. The results of the events were officially distributed to the OSCE
participating States during the meetings of the working bodies of this international
organization in Vienna, Austria.

In addition, to verify the fulfilment of international obligations by Russia,
representatives of the Armed Forces of Ukraine, together with the inspectors of NATO
member countries, conducted 4 observation missions in the Russian Federation under
the Open Skies Treaty during 2016.

chapter 7


In the framework of Ukraine's international commitments on the Vienna Document,
in the beginning of September of this year there were 77 representatives of OSCE
participating states and partner countries from 35 countries in Ukraine. They visited
air bases, land facilities and examined new types of weapons and military equipment
of the Armed Forces of Ukraine.

Today Ukraine is at the centre of international processes and transformations that
directly affect its interests (create new opportunities or carry serious risks and threats).
In connection with the changing international situation, the role and status of arms
control has significantly increased the scale and range of activities in order to build
confidence and security.

Ukraine is consistently fulfilling its international obligations in the field of arms
control and using mechanisms provided by international treaties and agreements to
disseminate objective information about the political-military situation in the country
and the real military activities of the Armed Forces and other Defence organisations
formed in accordance with the laws of Ukraine.


**In 2016, international cooperation was aimed at developing the capabilities of**
**the Ministry of Defence and the Armed Forces of Ukraine to respond adequately**
**to National Security threats of the State in the military sphere, to protect its**
**sovereignty, territorial integrity, to contribute to the European integration of**
**Ukraine and to maintain peace and security.**

**The main efforts were focused on further development of relations with**
**key partner countries, in particular the United States, Great Britain, Canada,**
**Germany, Poland, Lithuania, Latvia, Estonia, Romania and international**
**organizations, primarily NATO, EU, UN.**
