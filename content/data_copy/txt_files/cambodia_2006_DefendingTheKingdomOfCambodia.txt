## DEFENSE POLICY

 OF THE KINGDOM OF CAMBODIA

 2006


-----

I have always stated that the Defense White Paper
is a compass for the Royal Cambodian Armed Forces
(RCAF) in implementing the defense policy of the Royal
Government successfully. Obviously, one angle of the
Royal Government’s Rectangle Strategy demands an
effective response from the RCAF in its reform to
absolutely ensure peace, stability, security, sovereignty,
territorial integrity and the nation’s development.
Moreover, the RCAF is the leading force in promoting
Cambodia’s prestige on the international arena through
participation in peace and humanitarian missions within
the framework of United Nations requests.

To be successful, I appeal for efforts to fully
implement all policies stipulated in this very important
document, both within the RCAF and further encourage
the spirit of increasing cooperation from relevant
national and international agencies.


-----

I commend and hope that this Defense White
Paper 2006 will become a primary strategic guideline for
the performance of the RCAF’s roles and duties in the
construction and defense of our Angkor motherland.

The Royal Cambodian Armed Forces has a primary
role in the Defense of sovereignty, independence and
territorial integrity of the Kingdom of Cambodia, and
contributes to ensuring the stability, safety and security
that is essential and fundamental to ensuring the
nation’s development in all fields. Under no circumstance
does harmony and prosperity survive without stability
and security. Stability and security in a nation's society
contributes to peace for the region as well as for the
world as a whole.

We all fully recognise and respect the **win win**
policy of Samdech Prime Minister **Hun Sen. It is the**
single most effective strategic measure for national
reconciliation, a complete end to the suffering of Khmer
citizens, and to lead the Kingdom of Cambodia's
development in all fields.

Men and women of the RCAF have made countless
sacrifices in the campaign to implement the **win win**
policy. These people have helped to create a peaceful
environment and a ray of hope for the present and for
the future.


-----

Apart from ensuring a sustainable peace, stability,
and security for the nation, the RCAF has many more
responsibilities, including participation in the restoration
and construction of the nation and international
missions.

While overcoming complicated obstacles in its
reform process, the RCAF is promoting the prestige of the
Kingdom of Cambodia in the international arena and this
is unprecedented in the history of Cambodia.

Nevertheless, the ultimate realization of national
defense objectives, the success of RCAF reform, and our
prosperous future depend primarily on a realistic policy.
The Defense White Paper 2006 is a compass and
roadmap for us all to move toward those objectives.

**PREFACE**

In the past years, the security outlook of the
Kingdom of Cambodia has changed due to the evolving
regional and global security situation. The win win policy
and the spirit of national reconciliation of the Royal
Government with Samdech **Hun Sen as leader, has**
ended the internal crisis that troubled and destroyed the
nation for decades. However, Cambodia still faces the
need to address other major non-traditional issues that
threaten national security and development such as
international terrorism and transnational crime.

In its efforts to integrate into the international
community, Cambodia has undertaken duties for the
common interests of nations in the region as well as in
the world. Cambodia has fully cooperated in many areas
including security. The Royal Government is strongly
determined to combat terrorism. This will is revealed
through a number of major measures taken by the Royal
Government not only for the security and harmony of the
people of Cambodia but also for the wellbeing and
common interests of people in the region and the world.

Following the ascendancy of peace in late 1998,
Cambodia has endeavored to strengthen stability and
internal security as a strong basis for restoring and
rebuilding the nation. The RCAF is an important force for
carrying out the Royal Government’s policies, under both
the triangle and the current rectangle strategies.

-----

Everyone acknowledges the difficulty of reform under the
circumstances for the RCAF that are not so favorable.
While just emerging from war, the reform process has
met endless obstacles including some major problems
such as a lack of resources, unsuitable structure,
complicated bureaucracy, inadequate military bases and
accommodation and living conditions for soldiers, etc.

Nevertheless, the RCAF has achieved some great
success in its reform process. Apart from ensuring
security for the nation, the RCAF actively contributes to
rehabilitating physical infrastructure, rescuing people
during disasters and, since April 2006, participating in
international peace missions. The prestige of the
Kingdom of Cambodia is further enhanced in the
international arena as more than one hundred young
Cambodians are devoting their physical and mental
strength to the humanitarian cause and to the happiness
of a nation in Africa. Our mission does not end in Sudan.
Although the capability and resources of the RCAF is
limited, Cambodia will continue its efforts to participate
with the UN in other humanitarian peacekeeping
missions in the future.

Although progress is being made proudly in its
reform process, the RCAF still has many major tasks to
perform to comply with the strategic initiatives provided
in the following chapters of this Defense White Paper
2006. As recommended earlier by Samdech Prime
Minister Hun Sen, “the Defense White Paper is a
compass for the Royal Cambodian Armed Forces to
implement the defense policy of the Royal Government
successfully.”

**CHAPTER 1**
**REVIEW OF NATIONAL DEFENSE POLICY IN THE**
**DEFENSE WHITE PAPER 2000**

**OBJECTIVES OF NATIONAL DEFENSE**

The Royal Government's policy in the Defense
White Paper 2000 (DWP2000) focuses on security and
development throughout the Kingdom of Cambodia.
These objectives are set based on three main factors: the
Constitution of the Kingdom of Cambodia, the Royal
Government's Political agenda and assessments of
threats to security of the nation, demanding the full
contribution and commitment by the Royal Cambodian
Armed Forces (RCAF).

   - The defense force must absolutely be responsible
for prevention and resistance against any external threat,
must safeguard the territorial integrity of the nation, and
must also contribute to ensuring stability, security,
safety and social order.

   - To assist the Royal Government in the effort of
restoring and rebuilding the nation's administrative,
economic and social infrastructure, especially in
response to the Royal Government's policy on poverty
reduction, the RCAF has the obligation to contribute to
this duty, using capabilities and resources it has such as
constructing and repairing roads, building and fixing
irrigation systems, demining and so forth.

1


-----

   - When there are disasters such as floods,
droughts or epidemics, the RCAF has the obligation to
cooperate with all relevant authorities to rescue the
people.

   - Capability should be further developed to
participate in international peace operations within the
framework of United Nations requests.

As initiated in
these strategic
objectives, a number of principles
have been adopted
for the RCAF for
implementation.
These include the
defining of priorities for national
defense, military
strategy, the four
roles of the RCAF,
and a   number of
strategic initiatives
to ensure peace,
stability, social
security and
development of the
nation.

-----

Minister Hun Sen, "the RCAF must categorically be loyal
to the cause of the nation, respect the Constitution, be
disciplined and morally clean and polite, respect and love
the people, be dignified and sufficiently competent so
that it can perform the duty of safeguarding national
independence, sovereignty, territorial integrity, and
maintaining and strengthening peace, stability and social
security and order."

**_RCAF soldiers are always interested in helping the people in their area of_**
**_responsibility. HE General Meas Sophea, Deputy Commander-in-Chief and_**
**_Commander of Army, leads officers and NCOs to help transplant rice for the people._**

Generally, these strategic objectives mainly focus
on maintaining and strengthening peace, stability and
social security and encourage the RCAF to have more
involvement in national construction and development in
the wake of war; basically, they inspire the RCAF with
commitments to resisting external threats and to
strengthening internal security.

**PRIORITIES FOR NATIONAL DEFENSE**

The setting of national defense priorities is a key
factor in preparing strategic plans and for effective
implementation of all these strategic plans. It also helps
to simplify the performance of roles and duties of every
soldier in the RCAF. In addition, constant adherence to
the priorities can help to ensure transparency and
effectiveness in utilising resources; especially the
national defense budget.

Because the global security situation had changed
considerably after September 2001, the Royal
Government of Cambodia reviewed the defense policy in
the DWP2000 to positively respond to the security
situation. In the Defense Strategic Review (DSR),
officially published in 2002, the policy of countering
international terrorism was established and was
included as one of the strategic objectives that are being
implemented. At the same time, in order to successfully

4


-----

implement all the principles in the DWP2000, the DSR
2002 provides some recommendations in which the
national defense priorities are redefined by focusing on
some primary aspects as follows:

  - Strengthen border protection capability to prevent
transnational crime and infiltration of terrorists
and to increase contributions to infrastructure and
community development along the border,

  - Expand the Navy capability in the fields of
technology and resources to make the patrol and
protection of waters effective,

  - Accelerate defense reform, especially
demobilisation, raising the living standards of the
defense force, reorganising units and restructuring
training systems,

  - Set up force development mechanisms as quickly
as possible to ensure the sustainability and quality
of the defense force,

  - Increase participation in national development,
especially in the field of engineering, relief
operations, suppressing and eliminating
circulation of illegal small arms, environmental
protection (particularly preventing deforestation),
replanting trees, and other humanitarian activities,

  - Gradually develop capability to participate in
international and regional cooperation, especially a
UN small-scale peacekeeping operation in the
future.

5


-----

The change of national defense priorities does not
disrupt the implementation process of any strategic
policies. Instead, it provides new principles with more
realistic features to align with the situation and practical
needs, and enables the RCAF to overcome various
obstacles.

**MILITARY STRATEGY**

Based on the assessment of all threats to the
security of the Kingdom of Cambodia and in response to
all strategic policies defined in both the DWP2000 and in
the DSR 2002, a military strategy was prepared based on


**_The Military Attaché Corps of the Kingdom of Cambodia conducts a study visit to the_**
**_Thai-Cambodian Border Liaison Office at the Poipet Border Crossing, Banteay_**
**_Meanchey province._**


the principle of "Flexible and Controlled Response". This
strategy is an appropriate stance that Cambodia,
especially the RCAF, must adhere to given that the
country has just emerged from war and while the RCAF
is  undergoing  reform  and  capability  development.

6


-----

In addition, this strategy contributes to the Royal
Government's policy on national reconciliation,
peacefulness with neighbouring nations, and good-will
and effort to integrate Cambodia deeper into the
international community.

Cambodia's external security relies primarily on
the strengthening of internal security, a guarantee of
national unity, political stability and economic growth.
Nevertheless, although the nation has chosen a policy of
dialogue, it doesn’t mean that the presence of military
force on the borders is neglected. Although Cambodia is
a small country with an effete military capability, it
reserves the right to unconditionally respond to any
possible external aggression and this response would be
conducted with thorough control and patience. Although
there are military measures in such circumstances, other
options would be applied to reach a peaceful solution.

**OUTCOMES OF IMPLEMENTING THE STRATEGIC**
**INITIATIVES**

Over the past five years (2001-2005), we have seen
some progress in the implementation of strategic plans
defined by the DWP and the RCAF Five-Year Plan.
However, some important strategic objectives have not
been practicable or have made little progress. We have
noticed a number of accomplishments and shortcomings
as follows.

The RCAF has continuously strengthened the
security measures along the border, deploying border
protection units at all strategic points to ensure
sovereignty and territorial integrity of the Kingdom of

7


-----

Cambodia. These border protection forces are very
important to ensure that there is always a permanent
surveillance of the border to prevent any encroachments
and to cooperate with other competent institutions to
counter transnational crime. These forward-deployed
units, within their limits, and if required, can react
immediately to incidents and also collect and provide
intelligence for the purposes of operational planning.
Under the Royal Government's policy on community
development in remote and isolated rural areas,
especially areas along the border, the border protection
forces are the important security protection shield of the
future.

However, the border protection forces are
encountering a number of difficulties such as complex
terrain, a lack of roads for communication along the
border, capability deficiencies in some specialised skills,
difficulties in supply and transport, and a lack of forces
for rotation, etc.

The downsizing of combat units from divisional
level to brigade level and the amalgamation of some
regular brigades are a brilliant success. This measure
helps address the crisis of an insufficient force, making
command and control suitable to the competency of unit
commanders and thus facilitating logistics and material
supply systems. In addition, the reorganisation clearly
demonstrates steady progress of the RCAF reform.

The Royal Government has been largely successful
in demobilising its military personnel. Although 15,000
personnel, the number intended for demobilisation in

8


-----

phase two, remain to be demobilised, the current figure
represents a significant reduction compared to the
approximately 165,000 personnel  serving before
1999. The Royal Government plans to demobilise more
military personnel and detailed measures will be
described in the next chapter.


**_High dignitaries, Ministry of National Defense and the RCAF High Command_**
**_leaders, are awarded decorations of merit for their devotion to their eminent roles and_**
**_duties._**


The RCAF is gradually establishing a better
training system. Currently, training and indoctrination
for career soldiers and of specialised skills are being
strengthened. For career soldier training, we have a
proper system ranging from cadets, command and staff
levels up to strategic levels. However, problems remain
such as the quality of education still being limited
because the training programs and the competence of
instructors have not been significantly developed and
presently lack the means for education, and those
receiving training are not qualified enough.

9


-----

One of the RCAF's four roles is to contribute to
building and developing the nation. The RCAF has used
its still limited capabilities such as engineering, demining,
relief, etc., to assist the Royal Government in
rehabilitating and constructing physical infrastructure
and to contribute to reducing the nation's poverty. The
RCAF Engineering unit has accomplished better work in
building and repairing roads for communication and
irrigation systems while some other units concerned are
prepared to rescue people when they encounter disasters.
Medical institutions also engage in providing small scale
medical services to people; especially in rural
communities.


**_The RCAF High Command's Engineering Unit contributes actively with the Royal_**
**_Government to restore and build communication systems throughout the country. HE_**
**_LTGEN Kun Kim, Deputy Commander-in-Chief of the RCAF, inspects road work._**


There has been remarkable progress in efforts to
build counter-terrorism capability. Although this
capability is still small in size, it indicates an active
advance and is attracting the attention of the

10


-----

international community. The Royal Government, in
cooperation with the international community, will
continue to pay attention to expanding this capability in
the future.


**_Royal Gendarmes confiscate and collect illegal weapons as a measure to strengthen_**
**_security, safety and social order._**


The RCAF, especially the Royal Gendarmerie, has
fulfilled its duty actively and effectively in ensuring
security, safety and social order. Every citizen can travel
throughout the country without fear or restrictions.
Moreover, better security in society has helped enhance
the process of building democracy, economic growth,
rural development efforts and political stability.

Though there has been significant progress, the
failure to implement or the unsuccessful implementation
of a number of important strategic initiatives has created
obstacles to the overall reform of the RCAF. Those

11


-----

obstacles may have resulted from limited awareness of
defense policy principles, political influence, and a lack
of resources and means. In this context, we should
acknowledge some weaknesses that we need to address
in detail in the next chapter of the DWP2006. The key
points include:

  - The demobilisation of the defense force has not
achieved its final goal because of technical reasons.
We should re-address this issue, including
reviewing ultimate targets of demobilisation: a
clear structure and the number of military
personnel to be retained must be determined.

  - The defense budget is small in amount, not
sufficiently responding to the needs that are
priorities for national defense. This factor has
caused some important defense force reform
processes to encounter difficulties. In addition,
military equipment, mostly unserviceable, ageing
and dilapidated, is deteriorating due to inadequate
maintenance.

  - No progress has been made to improve soldiers'
living conditions because the limited defense
budget is not balanced with the needs of the
defense force. This situation, if prolonged, would
adversely affect the development of military
capability and force sustainment and may also
have undesirable consequences for the
implementation of the compulsory military service
law.

  - A defense force of high discipline, good
management and preparedness at all times

12


-----

depends mostly on proper barracks and
accommodation. Therefore, the effort to gradually
build bases must be taken into thorough
consideration.

- We have achieved good results in restructuring
units at lower levels fruitfully. However, the
structures at higher levels such as those of the
High Command and the Ministry of National
Defense need to be further reorganised in order to
reduce complexities in bureaucratic systems.

- The implementation of the pension law is still
impossible, disrupting the transfer of personnel
from the defense force.

- There is a need to implement other laws related to
soldiers’ daily duties as well as basic procedures
for cooperation between civilian and military
authorities.

- Roles and responsibilities between the border
protection forces have not been defined clearly.

**CHAPTER 2**
**ANALYSIS OF THREATS TO THE SECURITY OF THE**
**KINGDOM OF CAMBODIA**

**REGIONAL AND INTERNATIONAL ACTS OF TERROR**

The international terrorist threat has become a
violent epidemic for the whole of humanity. Since the
events of 11 September 2001, terrorism has spread in
almost every direction of the entire world. This threat is
presently a war which has no real fronts. Tragedies have
seriously affected innocent civilians, especially women
and children.


**_The ASEAN Defense Ministers Conference is held for the first time on 9 May 2006 in_**
**_Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia. This is an important forum for regional security dialogue._**


15


-----

No single nation on its own can prevent
transnational crime, but they must have preventive
measures. An effective reaction to terrorism demands an
international response based on close cooperation. Joint
international cooperation encompasses the exchange of
intelligence and technical cooperation, freezing terrorists'
financial networks and other activities to disrupt
terrorist concentration and constantly deny their access
to safe havens. The peace-loving nations in the world
must, without reluctance, join together to counter
international terrorism.

**TERRORISM AND CAMBODIA'S SECURITY**

The Kingdom of Cambodia's general security
situation began to stabilise after the Royal Government
implemented the **win win policy; this policy led to the**
end of internal war and the final demise of the Khmer
Rouge's political and military organisations in late 1998.
Nevertheless, dramatic changes in the global security
situation, especially since the events of September 2001
and a series of worldwide terrorist attacks, has forced
Cambodia to take some firm security measures to
prevent any destruction that might eventually occur.

The Royal Government has always expressed
goodwill by fully cooperating with the international
community in taking actions against terrorism. The
Ministry of Foreign Affairs and International Cooperation
of the Kingdom of Cambodia also issued an urgent
statement strongly condemning the brutal October 2002
attacks in Bali, Indonesia. In May 2003, Cambodian
authorities disrupted in time attempts to establish a
Jemaah Islamiyah (JI) terror network by arresting some

16


-----

members of this group. In the meeting of ASEAN Heads
of State in June 2003, His Excellency Hor Nam Hong,
Cambodian Foreign Minister and His Excellency
Alexander Downer, Australian Foreign Minister, signed
the _Memorandum on Co-operation to Combat Terrorism_
including the exchange of intelligence and technical
assistance.


**_HE Hor Nam Hong, Minister for Foreign Affairs and International Cooperation of the_**
**_Kingdom of Cambodia, and HE Alexander Downer, Australian Foreign Affairs Minister,_**
**_sign the Memorandum on Cooperation to Combat International Terrorism._**


To further promote security, the Prime Minister of
Cambodia solemnly decided to completely destroy the
man-portable STRELA2 air Defense missile systems and
surface-to-air SA3 missiles. This measure is part of
preventing this type of weapon from falling into the
hands of terrorists, who could use them to target

17


-----

anything easily. Moreover, it helps to ensure the safety of
civil air traffic.


**_MAJGEN Hindmarsh, Commander of Australian Special Forces Command, calls on_**
**_HE GEN Pol Saroeun, Deputy Commander-in-Chief and Chief of Joint Staff of the_**
**_RCAF, during a visit to Cambodia to strengthen CT cooperation._**


Although effective actions have been taken,
Cambodia still considers the international terrorist threat
to the security of the Kingdom of Cambodia as a real
concern. Cambodia faces challenges in enhancing the
defense of its land border and its long stretch of sea
border. Lack of communication infrastructure along the
border, coupled with a lack of equipment and some
specialised skills, could possibly allow the infiltration of
terrorists. Also, the capability of law enforcement
authorities to investigate the activities of major terror
groups is limited due to the lack of training and
resources.

18


-----

There remain other aspects for Cambodia's
increased attention to unequivocally prevent direct
attacks by international acts of terror. Cambodia is
keeping a close watch for the possible link between
terrorism, drug trafficking and illegal immigration.
Nevertheless, Cambodia is a country that has some
advantageous features:

  - Efforts being made to prevent terrorist activity
from happening in the Kingdom of Cambodia are a
key policy the Royal Government has always
espoused. This policy includes non-discrimination
on religious grounds.

  - Cambodia, luckily, is situated geographically
separate from the source of the terrorist surge.
None of the country's borders serve as a strategic
corridor to be used as a stepping-stone for attacks,
hideouts or direct support by foreign terrorists.
Therefore, the flow of resources, manpower and the
possibility of strong support in the region by
foreign terrorists is very difficult. In addition,
neighbouring countries all have the same position
of strongly opposing terrorism.

  - Terrorists would find it difficult to conscript
volunteers to commit suicide or anyone to
undertake a terrorist act in Cambodia. Conducting
terrorism in Cambodia would be more difficult for
any forces brought in from outside.

  - There are no signs of the spread of Islamic
extremism or Jihad or any states seeking
separation.

19


-----

However, though such observations are made, the
Royal Government of Cambodia is still concerned and
has been on alert and has taken some measures that will
be detailed in Chapter 4.

**SECURITY OF SOCIETY**

Recently, the Royal Government has focused on
measures to prevent and reduce the dangers caused by
the spread of drugs throughout the country. The flow
and transnational circulation of drugs, especially
amphetamine, is becoming a major threat to the
Kingdom of Cambodia's security and has worsened in the

**_presents gifts to young men receiving drug rehabilitation services at the Drug_**

past five years. Cambodia was once just a transit point
but it has become a direct user. Drugs are hotly hitting
the royal capital of Phnom Penh, Sihanoukville and some
other major provinces, especially areas on the border.
Groups of adolescent boys and girls, who lack education,
have been worst hit (by the drugs). Criminals smuggling

drugs are becoming highly competent while authorities
are facing difficulties with means and materials for
operations and skills.


**_HE LTGEN Chay Saing Yun, Secretary of State for Defense (right) and Mr David de_**
**_Beer, EU-ASAC Project Manager (left), sign a Memorandum of Cooperation to_**
**_Control Small Arms and Light Weapons._**


To date, Cambodia has made a lot of progress in
dealing with the circulation and use of illegal weapons
left over by war. Over the past years, Cambodia, in
cooperation with the European Union (EU), has
demonstrated a good-will and strong determination in
the fight to take strict control of weapons and explosives.
Tens of thousands of weapons surplus to requirement for
national defense and weapons collected from illegal
possession have progressively been destroyed under the
"Flame of Peace" policy of the Royal Government.
Weapons kept for use are safely secured in armouries.
The programme supported by the EU not only benefits
security of the society, but it also enables development of

21


-----

the community by seeking to stop the use of illegal
weapons in exchange for a small-scale development in
the community. Eliminating the legacy of war that
continues to take hundreds of lives each year—
landmines and unexploded ordnance remains the Royal
Government's top priority.

Land issues are
a source of conflict
in society.
Officially registered
land titles given to
individuals and
agencies including
the RCAF by the
Ministry of Land
Management, Urban Planning and
Construction could
help prevent this
kind of conflict
and could contribute to ensuring
internal stability,
security and social
order in the

_Weapons are secured properly in safe armories with_
_cooperation and assistance from the EU-ASAC Project_ Kingdom of
_throughout the country._ Cambodia. The

RCAF must set an
example by officially registering land it is using.

The incident on 16 June 2005 when children were
held hostage at the International School in Siem Reap
was a significant lesson learnt. Although this was a bold
ransom attempt and not an act of terror, it is a warning

22


-----

that such an act of terror could possibly occur in the
future.

**GEOGRAPHIC CHALLENGES**

As already concluded in the DWP2000, there is no
indication of external military threats to the Kingdom of
Cambodia for the present time as well as for the short
and medium term future. This conclusion is based on
the favourable conditions along all borders around
Cambodia. Although some problems continue to exist
such as unclear demarcation of the border line, and the
Montagnard ethnic minority migration, resolution with
authorities and governments of neighbouring countries
has been made patiently and diplomatically.

Border disputes with neighbouring countries are a
long-standing historic legacy that continues to this day.
All these disputes have arisen from unclear demarcation
of the border line and other problems resulting from joint
ventures and exploitation of natural maritime resources.
When there are conflicts, Cambodia has opted for
negotiations to discuss and settle these problems.
Nevertheless, this option does not preclude the presence
of military forces on the border. The impact of many
years of protracted war has meant that some areas have
not been under the control of one administration,
especially in provinces adjacent to the border, resulting
in Cambodia having temporarily lost some control over
its borders. The signing of a supplementary treaty to the
1985 State Border Demarcation Agreement by the heads
of state of the Kingdom of Cambodia and of the Socialist
Republic of Vietnam is an historic and positive

23


-----

contribution to the process of defining a clear border
between the two countries for the future.


**_Army Engineering Forces play an important role in restoring and building physical_**
**_infrastructure in remote and isolated rural areas as part of its contribution to_**
**_facilitating people’s livelihood._**


The quality and quantity of the roads for
communication in the Kingdom of Cambodia,
particularly the land road system, is not yet able to
facilitate all movements throughout the country. This
aspect interrupts growth of economic links between the
central capital and various public places throughout the
Kingdom of Cambodia. More often, all forms of trade
exchanges are made directly with neighbouring countries
because of the ease of access to businesses, resulting in
the loss of profits and human resources to the outside.

To improve geographic security throughout
Cambodia, it is required to make the administration and
leadership systems accessible to all border areas. This

24


-----

activity will increase the assurances of state sovereignty
and bring the administration closer to the populace
forever. This will be made possible by building
infrastructure; including roads, information networks
and other needs enabling local communities to have
permanent links to the central administration.

**DEMOGRAPHIC ISSUES**

Cambodia has a small population that lives in
geographically isolated communities. The population of
more than 13 million people in 2005 is still small. War,

that have resulted in few people living in border areas.
Cambodia's demographic situation has some
characteristics such as the absence of a generation lost
in times of war, the burden of a baby-boom in the wake

25


-----

of war, the diverse density of the population in some
areas, and the rise in urbanisation.

Cambodia is encountering unemployment
problems for adolescent boys and girls. The Royal
Government has been trying to encourage an increase in
employment in the countryside through the irrigation
system expansion policy to enable production of several
agricultural crops each year. Similarly, urban areas are
facing the same problem of unemployed youth. The
Royal Government is concerned with a growing statistic
in youth and must double attention to managing
unemployment and to attracting investments.

As described briefly earlier, a number of
demographic consequences are causing problems to the
whole Cambodian society such as the unbalanced
allocation of resources, the land not being fully used, low
education in the countryside, the AIDS crisis,
unemployment, etc. The Royal Government is focusing
its attention to developing border areas through the
restoration and construction of infrastructure and
economic development. The RCAF is an important force
that can contribute to the realisation of this task,
especially in remote and isolated border areas and places
where awful legacies of war remain.

**ECONOMIC ISSUES**

Today, Cambodia's economic potential is primarily
based on agriculture. In addition, the textile industry,
tourism and construction are making steady progress.
Cambodia is now self-sufficient particularly in rice, but
remains dependent primarily on weather and rain. Using
70 percent of the active people, Cambodia has been able

26


-----

to produce rice crops surplus to requirement since 2002
and this quantity is expected to increase in the future,
except when encountering natural disasters. Cambodia
has not yet fully exploited its vital resources such as ores,
rubber, petroleum, etc.


**_Bridges and communication routes in the countryside are built by RCAF Engineers to_**
**_contribute to implementing the Royal Government’s policy on poverty reduction._**


With active support from the armed forces, the
Royal Government has succeeded in reducing and
eliminating smuggling activities and money laundering
that has seriously impacted the national economy. The
defense force has also actively contributed to restoring
and constructing communication infrastructure,
especially in a number of difficult areas such as road 56
(from Pursat province to the Thai border), road 41 (from
the provincial town of Kampong Speu to O’ral district),
important roads to the north of road 6 and to the east of
the Mekong. In addition, the defense force has
contributed to restoring irrigation systems and clearing

27


-----

mines in order to provide greater potential for expanding
agriculture and tourism.

Economic development can be progressed based
largely on security and social safety as well as political
stability. In addition, the maintenance of sufficient
security at trade corridors, airports and maritime routes
is vital for economic growth.

Over the past years, the world, especially a
number of countries in Southeast Asia, has been
troubled by the outbreak of Severe Acute Respiratory
Syndrome and Avian Influenza. The crisis of these
diseases has resulted in the interruption of economic,
trade and industry activities all over the world. At
present, Cambodia has focused its attention to
cooperating with the international community in
combating Avian Influenza threatening almost
everywhere across the globe, and it considers that this
problem might affect tourism and investment in
Cambodia.

Every year, Cambodia receives financial support,
in the form of grants and loans and through programs
and projects of various organizations, from the
international community. This aid is very important for
stability and economic growth to promote development in
other areas, especially to reduce poverty. Nevertheless,
ensuring most of this assistance reaches the intended
targets to benefit those in need remains a problem.
According to a survey by the Royal Government as well
as some international opinions, only about 40 percent of
assistance has benefited the poor Khmers. The
remainder has served the interests of program

28


-----

consultants, especially foreigners. The prime concern in
this matter is the delay in transferring skills from foreign
experts to local personnel and expanding programs or
projects by experts and local personnel. The survey also
indicates that there are more local personnel with
competence similar to foreign consultants and the
comparison indicates that foreign consultants need 10 to
15 times as much salary than they can manage to pay
local personnel in the same position.

Food security is an essential factor that must be
taken into thorough consideration. At present, Cambodia
is encountering some problems such as the illegal import
of poor quality food, the use of chemical substances to
preserve food, the lack of hygiene when food is
distributed, etc. The Royal Government is paying
attention to strengthening the control exercised by
authorities and to educating people by means of various
media systems to understand the importance of food
security.

**ENVIRONMENTAL ISSUES**

Both during and after war, Cambodia has
continuously lost its valuable natural resources. Apart
from the nation's cultural heritage that has been
plundered and sold abroad, the nation's forests,
biodiversity and fish stocks have been under serious
threat. The devastation might occur because of a number
of sources such as lack of sufficient security for effective
law enforcement (war and insecurity), effete economy
making people more dependent upon the natural wealth,
rather than (manual) production, and corruption; paving
the way for the incursion of evil people and foreigners.

29


-----

Up to now, Cambodian people have not paid
attention to the lack of clean water for their use. In the
wet season, some places don't have enough water for
farming and for drinking, especially in the eastern and
southern provinces. In the dry season, a large number of
rice fields and farm land are left vacant and villagers are
forced to leave their home villages to find work in the city.
Every year, this environmental crisis gradually adds
more burdens to the social and demographic crisis. The
3[rd] Term Government of this National Assembly has
focused primarily on irrigation systems, which is a key
approach to solving this problem.

Rainforests in Cambodia have decreased from 73
percent of the country’s total area before 1970 to 61
percent in 2002. In order to prevent the loss of forests,
the Royal Government of Cambodia has continuously set
forth policy, orders, prakas (regulations) and law on
forests, undertaking the implementation of forest reform
in depth towards effective management, conservation,
prevention and utilisation of forests in 1998 up to now.
But, the challenging problem is cutting and clearing,
burning and bulldozing forests and grabbing it for
ownership, business and expansion of agricultural land
areas. In order to prevent this situation, the Royal
Government has set forth orders on the prevention,
suppression and elimination of cutting and clearing,
burning and bulldozing and fencing off forests, which
requires participation and cooperation from local
authorities and relevant agencies by creating a national
committee and municipal and/or provincial subcommittees to be led, for direct implementation, by
municipal and/or provincial governors.

**CHAPTER 3**
**STRATEGY 2006**

**STRATEGIC FRAMEWORK 2006**

The development of a new strategy to advance
defense reform and the maintenance of defense
capability is based primarily on consideration of a
number of factors; as follows:

**Resources: The defense budget is very limited if**
compared to the requirements of defense reform and
RCAF development. About 61 percent of the overall
budget is used to cover salary and about 36 percent of
the budget is allocated for food, fuel and military
equipment. Therefore, the remnant of the meagre budget
cannot fully respond to other major needs such as the
reduction of military personnel, base construction, repair
and maintenance of military material, training, and
capability building for international cooperation, etc.

To sustain force development, maintenance of the
defense budget package at about 2.7 percent of the
Gross Domestic Product for a further period of 5 years
must be taken into consideration. This undertaking
would offer a possibility to progress military reform while
the national economy grows and the number of RCAF
personnel is gradually reduced. A reduction of the
defense budget each time there is a demobilisation of
military personnel would not allow an opportunity for
reform to progress. In addition, the defense institution

31


-----

remains unable on its own to implement a number of
strategic policies of the Royal Government, especially the
downsizing of military forces. Nevertheless, the use and
management of the defense budget in accordance with
priorities and transparency is a key element where some
recommendations will be raised in the next chapter.

**Political Impact: Peace, political stability and**
economic growth offer a good opportunity for building
and developing RCAF capability. The defense force’s
loyalty to the nation depends primarily on the neutrality
of the military forces. While the nation enjoys full peace
and political stability is improving, making the armed
forces free of political influence will encourage more
opportunities for building confidence in, and respect and
love from, the populace and more possibilities for
economic prosperity.

Ensuring peace, sovereignty, territorial integrity
and the steady maintenance of internal stability demand
a constant indoctrination of national ideals into
personnel of the armed forces in all circles. The ideals
will take shape and spread based on political will of the
whole national society, especially the real neutral stance
to be held by the armed forces. The principles for
building the defense force's neutrality will be described
in detail in the next part of this document.

**International Trends: Absorbing assistance from**
the international community for the development of the
RCAF is an indispensable factor. Also, the armed forces
have the duty to endeavour to build its prestige on the
international arena, which can be achieved through
gradual integration. The reform process of the RCAF at
the present time has revealed the necessity for constant
cooperation with friendly countries and various

32


-----

international institutions in a number of major areas
such as the downsizing of the defense force, human
resource training, technological development, cooperative
efforts against crime and international terrorism,
participation in multinational disaster relief operations,
etc.

**_Cambodia and Australia. HE LTGEN Neang Phat (centre front row), Secretary of_**
**_State for National Defense, presided at this seminar._**

In this context, the RCAF needs to endeavour to
continuously expand close cooperation with international
circles regardless of affiliation through building better
relations, trust and a sense of mutual understanding.
Also, all strategic measures must be thoroughly prepared
in a realistic and transparent manner.

33


-----

**STRATEGIC OBJECTIVES 2006**

As the nation has just emerged from war, the
Kingdom of Cambodia's defense policy has focussed only
on the strengthening of peace and internal stability and
national development.

As already mentioned in the previous chapter, two
main objectives in the Royal Government's defense policy

**_LTGEN (retd.) John Sanderson (fourth from left), former UNTAC Force Commander_**
**_and current Goodwill Ambassador for Austcare, during his visit to Cambodia to view_**
**_demining projects in the northwestern border areas of Cambodia, pays a courtesy call_**
**_on HE General Tea Banh, Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Defense (centre)._**

are to make a long-lasting security and opportunity
available for the development of the nation while the
RCAF is implementing all strategic measures to
ultimately achieve these objectives. The new strategic
framework from 2006 onwards requires a consideration
of possibilities for further action while the RCAF is
moving forward in developing its capability; that is, other
necessary tasks rather than the internal ones. With the

34


-----

evolution of global security trends and apart from its
contribution to security and development for the nation,
the RCAF must have another duty: engagement in
international affairs. Therefore, the new objectives of the
defense policy are **Security,** **Development** **and**
**International Cooperation.**

**Security: As already defined in the DWP 2000, the**
RCAF is responsible for ensuring peace, stability and
social order for the entire nation. All strategic measures
must be implemented effectively to absolutely ensure an
opportunity for restoration of physical infrastructure and
development of the national economy.

Border protection measures must always be
effective under all circumstances. The border of
Cambodia has been under threat and uncontrolled
during times of war, resulting mainly from the lack of
internal unity and the absence of border protection
forces. Over the past years, especially following the
national reconciliation and the complete demise of
breakaway groups, the border protection task has been
strengthened steadily. Irregularities are continuously
occurring among neighbouring countries; therefore, the
physical presence of armed forces on the border is vital
to ensure the permanent existence of sovereignty and
territorial integrity. In addition, this presence also
encourages safe trade exchanges and opportunities for
community development on the border.

Ensuring stability, safety and social order is also
vital for economic growth, tourism and investment. The
RCAF contributes to maintaining security throughout the
nation.

35


-----

**Development:** Under no circumstances does
development take place without security. The RCAF has
played its role to make people live in harmony and
conduct their businesses freely to contribute to
promoting the national economy. Along with the national
defense task, the defense force has also continued to
contribute to national construction through the use of its
capabilities such as de-mining, roads, ridges works,
irrigation systems, and relief operations, etc.

**International** **Cooperation:** The objective of
international cooperation is consistent with the Royal

Government's
policy of integrating
Cambodia into the
international community. From now
on, the RCAF must
be more active in
getting engaged in
the international
environment, which
is   an  important

activity for
promoting its
prestige. Enhancing international cooperation is not only
a task of building
good relations or
of strengthening
alliances between

**_RCAF officers and officers from other countries are_**

country and

**_receiving UN military observer training in Australia._**

country,   but  it


36


-----

also indicates our good-will in the cause of fostering
peace, stability and the protection of mutual interest
among neighbouring countries and those in the same
region. Also, Article 53 of the Constitution of the
Kingdom of Cambodia clearly stipulates the right of
participation of the Cambodian defense forces within the
framework of United Nations proposals.

**MILITARY STRATEGY 2006**

The DWP 2000 defines a military strategy based on
"flexible and controlled response". The strategy requires
the RCAF to respond in time and according to the real
situation to any circumstances threatening the nation's
security and interests. Nevertheless, our approach must
always be controlled with patience and thoroughness.

The implementation of the strategy in the past has
seen positive results and ensured sustainability of peace
and better social stability. Therefore, Cambodia must
continue to apply this strategy until it needs to be
changed.

The three-layered national defense system of
Strategic Level, Operational Level, and Tactical Level is
the core of strengthening this military strategy. Based on
past experience, the RCAF must pay more attention to a
number of principles as will be written in the next
chapter.

**PRIORITIES FOR NATIONAL DEFENSE 2006**

The DWP 2000 and the DSR 2002 define in
sequence a number of priorities in an attempt to promote

37


-----

the effectiveness and progress in the RCAF reform
process. Although encountering some obstacles, the
defining of these priorities has produced positive results
for the implementation of strategic principles in the past.
According to the evolution of the international security
situation and the needs of the RCAF reform process in
the next 5 years (2006-2010), we should review the
priorities of national defense through the following
recommendations:


**_Samdech Prime Minister Hun Sen presides at the closing ceremony of the RCAF 5-Year_**
**_Work Achievement Review (2000-2004) and the Future 5-Year Objectives (2005-2009) at_**
**_the Ministry of National Defense._**


- Further reform of the whole defense institution
must be made. The reform must be focused on
reorganising the military structures at all levels,
improving bureaucratic and legal systems and,
more importantly, reorganising command and
control, logistic and financial systems.

38


-----

- Border protection measures must be strengthened
more effectively by ensuring the permanent
presence of suitably equipped armed forces on all
borders. The sustainability of this force must be
maintained by a number of measures to be
detailed in the next chapter.

- The utility and management of national defense
resources must be checked and reorganised so
that they can be used according to the intended
objectives and transparently to prioritised plans.

- An appropriate resource must be put aside to
restore the poor condition of military equipment or,
if possible, to re-equip; especially naval vessels and
the Army's military equipment that are vital for the
protection of land borders and maritime areas.

- It is necessary to build military bases so that units
will be properly controlled. Such construction
must gradually be made and the bases must be
built in a favourable location.

- More effort must be made to develop the defense
force, including determination of the required
RCAF size, implementation of the Compulsory
Military Service (CMS) Law and a modern military
legal system including the Pensions Law, the
Defense Disciplinary Act etc., as well as human
resource training and improving the living
standard of soldiers.

- Counter-terrorism capability must gradually be
built up by trying to absorb support from the
international community.

39


-----

  - A number of capabilities must be strengthened so
that they can be used in international peace
operations.

  - Medical service capabilities must also be
strengthened so that the RCAF is able to
contribute to international operations in the
framework of Military Operations Other Than War
(MOOTW). These capabilities can also be used for
local development work like providing basic
medical services including emergency aid and
educating the public to be aware of hygiene.

The success of the above-mentioned priorities
demands proper planning, particularly in the next FiveYear Plan (2006-2010) of the RCAF, a high sense of
determination by leaders in the implementation of
measures, the right use and management of the defense
budget and regular control.

**RCAF ROLES**

As already defined, the RCAF has four primary
roles: 1. defending the country and national interests, 2.
ensuring security, safety and social order, 3.
contributing to national construction, and 4. enhancing
international cooperation. These important roles will
continue to be given to the RCAF because they are
consistent with the new objectives of the Kingdom of
Cambodia's national defense: **Security, Development**
**and International Cooperation.**

40


-----

**CHAPTER 4**
**STRATEGIC INITIATIVES 2006**

**BORDER DEFENSE**

One of the important and vital national defense
priorities defined in Chapter 3 is to safeguard the border
of the Kingdom of Cambodia. While border disputes,
threats from transnational criminals and international
terrorism remain a concern, Cambodia needs to
strengthen its border protection capability to maintain
peace and stability with neighbouring countries and to
ensure security for the entire nation. The capability of
border protection forces must further be strengthened,
especially the sustainable presence of forces at all
strategically important points, expertise in preventing
infiltration by international terrorism and transnational
crime, mobility, communication, information collection,
cooperation with other competent authorities, etc.
Strengthening the presence of border protection forces
does not mean confrontation; on the contrary, timely
understanding and control of situations is an important
element for a positive solution and confidence building in
the region. In addition, regular contact at the working
level with partners will increase confidence and facilitate
better relationships.

Rotating border protection forces is an important
issue to be solved first of all. Given that the structure of
communication along the border areas is inadequate and,
coupled with the natural conditions of the locality,
border guards have difficulty in performing their duties
and face exhaustion. Therefore, regular rotation of forces
is required, especially to ensure the presence (of forces)

41


-----

at all times. If required, forces of Sub-Operational Zones
under each military region could be reinforced for this
purpose. Geographic importance should be reviewed for
the deployment of border protection units; for instance,
some areas seem unnecessary for the deployment of
military forces.


_Army Border Protection Unit on patrol and checking border markers._


Consideration should be given to equip border
protection forces with a number of suitable materials and
necessary equipment such as personal gear for
mountainous operations, GPS, communication radios,
the means for troop movement, rations, etc. Other
technical skills concerning counter-terrorism and
transnational crime are being offered continuously by
some friendly countries.

To make border protection effective and avoid
disruptions, the performance of duties by all categories

42


-----

of border protection forces must be coordinated. For
internal coordination, the unified command commission
of provinces/municipalities could be a coordinating
mechanism for cooperation between relevant authorities,
and military regional border peacekeeping committees
have a duty to coordinate with foreign partners as
regularly done. Border protection tasks must be clearly
defined for the RCAF and the National Police.

Maintaining a constant presence of manpower
along the border areas is necessary. Therefore, for
manpower to be able to live, it depends on roads for
communication, water, electricity and the existing
community. RCAF Engineering is capable and has some
resources to build roads for communication along the
border little by little. Small-scale hydroelectricity could
be built in some places where water sources permit.
Apart from the settlement of local people following
establishment of infrastructure, demobilised soldiers
wanting to make a new living can also settle there. In
addition, those demobilised soldiers could become
reserves when the country has a state of emergency. It
should also be noted that these development roads are
an important means of communication for the border
protection mission.

**COUNTER-TERRORISM CAPABILITY**

As described in the previous chapter, the terrorist
threat is a concern to which the Royal Government is
always paying its constant attention. Although the
possibility of a direct attack on Cambodia may be low, a
number of concrete measures must be taken to ensure
security and safety for the nation. Those measures
include:

43


-----

- Closely monitor any extremist movement
throughout the country.

- Strictly control all border crossing points,
especially land, riverine and maritime corridors
bordering the three countries.

**_CT skill training of the RCAF Special Forces._**

- Further strengthen control measures for weapons
and explosives, especially greater attention must
be paid to the great danger of using chemical
substances to make improvised explosives.

- Regular strengthening of security measures
implementation at various potential targets
vulnerable to any possible attacks such as
international airports, tourist destinations and
important resorts, international educational
establishments, supermarkets, foreign embassies,
etc.

- Strive to deny access by external terror networks,
especially infiltration of terrorist networks,
ideological indoctrination, and the transfer of
technologies by the internet, and financial
transfers by terrorists.

44


-----

  - Enhance international cooperation in order to
further seek technical capability, expertise and
resources and information.

Moreover, Cambodia is taking a clear position in the
fight against terrorism with a 5 “C” political guideline as
principles:

**Commitment** **(Sochhanthiek):** The Royal
Government has demonstrated its determination in the
fight against international terrorism since the attacks of
11 September 2001. The consistent stance of the Royal
Government of Cambodia has revealed its dedicated
cooperation with the international community by denying

**_Soldiers of the 911 Special Forces Airborne Brigade conducting training in hostage_**
**_recovery tactics as part of their CT training._**

access to terrorists and not allowing them to use
Cambodia as their safe havens and for other destructive
purposes. Cambodia will continue to take this stance for
the nation’s harmony and peacefulness as well as for
nations in the region and in the world.

45


-----

**Capability (Samattapheap): The RCAF has some**
units that can undertake missions to fight against
terrorism; 911[th] Special Airborne Brigade, 70[th] Brigade,
the Royal Gendarmerie, and the Navy’s Scuba Unit are
the Special Forces that can be used for such an
operation. Nevertheless, the capabilities of these units
are still limited and require more training and equipment.

**_The Cambodian Air Force contributes actively to CT Unit training._**

**Coordination (Samrorbsomroul): In the event that**
the nation encounters an attack by terrorists,
coordination at the national level must exist to take
control of the ongoing situation and to take effective
responsive measures. The coordinating mechanism, with
command and control by the National Counter-Terrorism
Committee and its Secretariat, plays an important role of
coordinating all relevant institutions and agencies such
as military, police, intelligence, medical services, and
foreign affairs agencies, etc., for the use of forces, the
management of means and resources, and taking

46


-----

appropriate actions in accordance with the situation.
Each relevant institution and unit must also have such a
mechanism of their own to serve the national level
mechanism.

**Cooperation** **(Sahakprortebatkar):** No single
nation or institution can contain terrorism on their own.
This great threat requires responses through bilateral or
multilateral cooperation. The RCAF, the National Police,
and other relevant institutions are in great need of
support from international partners to expand capability
in this area; especially ensuring preparedness at all
times to respond to the situation, and for materials and
equipment to fulfil duties.

**Code of Law (Soniteh): The Royal Government is**
developing counter-terrorism law with support from
Australia. This law will serve as a basis for implementing
all measures and for international cooperation.

**MARITIME SECURITY**

Cambodia’s sea border is an area vulnerable to
security threats, including terrorism and transnational
crime. A number of incidents that might occur such as
maritime border issues, infiltration of illegal fishing, loss
of maritime resources, etc have been called into question
for the maritime security of the Kingdom of Cambodia.

This sea border is also a route for promoting trade
with nations around the world. The coast and islands are
growing tourist destinations and they are also points of
interest for foreign investment. These maritime assets
must be protected. Nevertheless, responsibility should
not rest solely with the Navy. Other relevant government

47


-----

agencies must also share responsibility for maritime
security and protection. Therefore, it is necessary to
create a coordinating mechanism to clearly define how
this responsibility should be shared. The Navy is the
Royal Government’s lead agency for offshore operations.
The Navy has a mandate as the nation’s force with
authority to control maritime areas. Therefore, it plays a
role in helping other government agencies to achieve
their missions there.

**_Senior leaders of the RCAF (HE Deputy Prime Minister Tea Banh) and military_**
**_attachés of various countries visit Royal Cambodian Navy sailors on Pouluway Island._**

The Maritime Exclusive Economic Zone is an
important national economic resource. Cambodia has
the right and authority to control exploration, conduct
business, and to conserve and manage organic and
inorganic natural resources of the continental shelf,

48


**_Senior leaders of the RCAF (HE Deputy Prime Minister Tea Banh) and military_**


-----

under the sea and on the sea surface, and other
activities leading to exploration and business.

**_Special Forces Diver Training for 911[th] Special Airborne Brigade._**

The maritime environment is a potential corridor
and trade passage, but it is also vulnerable and difficult
to control. To achieve the nation’s objectives, it is
necessary to:

  - Safeguard territorial waters and protect resources
in Cambodia’s Exclusive Economic Zone to ensure
all of Cambodia's maritime assets are used for
sustainable development of Cambodia.

  - Maintain peace and cooperation in the region
where borders are bound with neighbouring
countries.

49


-----

  - Protect maritime trade access and shipping to
ensure that these vital communications are
assured for economic development and trade
exchanges with Cambodia’s trade partners.

  - Prevent all illegal activities conducted in the
maritime environment and contribute to
maintaining regional maritime security. These
include fighting against terrorism, piracy and
smuggling, transportation of illegal drugs, weapons
and humans and other transnational crime.

  - For the safety of people’s livelihood and the
protection of maritime assets, be capable of
responding to various disasters, whether natural,
caused by technical failures, or manmade.

To achieve these objectives, the Navy must
increase its maritime capability to be able to:

a. Deploy military forces to the sea,

b. Conduct surveillance and patrol operations,

c. Interdict and board vessels,

d. Search and rescue,

e. Transport and support armed forces and civil
authorities,

f. Dive and destroy ordnance, and

g. Train and operate with armed forces in the region.

A basic capability required for the Navy to perform
its duty is the ability to conduct regular patrols of

50


-----

territorial waters and islands. This basic capability
requires the maintenance and repair to a number of
patrol boats and resources that are necessary such as
fuel to support operations. The Cambodian Navy needs
technologies and skills for operations to counter
transnational crime and infiltration of terrorists and
these technologies and skills are being acquired
gradually with support from international security
partners. If possible, using aircraft to keep sea borders
under surveillance is an effective approach. Aircraft fitted
with surveillance equipment can operate over a vast
maritime area in a short period of time and reach targets
quickly.

**_Commander of the Royal Cambodian Navy speaks during the handover ceremony of_**
**_two patrol boats donated by the Vietnamese Navy to the RCN at the Ream Naval Base,_**
**_February 2006._**

In the near future, the Navy will receive some new
equipment, including patrol vessels, fast vessels, radars
and a workshop. This equipment will enhance maritime
security capability. Nevertheless, relevant institutions

51


**_Commander of the Royal Cambodian Navy speaks during the handover ceremony of_**


-----

should carefully consider the sustainability of operating
and maintaining this equipment and measures necessary
for coordinating naval operations with other relevant
authorities within the area of their responsibilities.

Joint maritime patrols with neighbouring countries
are a good way to reduce border issues, various illegal
activities, piracy, infiltration of terrorism, transnational
crime, etc. According to an agreement signed with
Vietnam, the Cambodian Navy will conduct joint patrols
with the Vietnamese Navy. Such an activity might be
conducted with Thailand in response to an invitation
received from Thailand since 1999.

**CAPABILITY TO COMBAT TRANSNATIONAL CRIME**

Transnational crime is a constant threat to
Cambodia’s social security. These illegal activities
include the circulation of drugs, human trafficking, all
kinds of smuggling, money laundering and trafficking of
national treasures. In the past, the RCAF, in cooperation
with relevant authorities, has actively contributed to
preventive and suppressive measures. However, the
RCAF needs additional specialist capabilities so that all
actions will be taken in time and effectively.

In fact, in order to respond in time, all relevant
authorities must increase their awareness of the
increasing danger to Cambodian society and double their
attention to assure all measures being applied effectively.
Nevertheless, Cambodia alone cannot withstand these
major threats. External cooperation is required to build
the capability of Cambodia’s law enforcement authorities

52


-----

to effectively respond to this danger. At present, the
government of the USA is focusing its attention on
providing training to the Cambodian military and police
and other law enforcement institutions in some
capabilities leading to the possibility of conducting joint
operations at a number of strategic points and passages
such as Poipet, Koh Kong, Ream and the northern border
of the Mekong passage.

**_HE General Tea Banh, Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Defense, visits the_**
**_Drug Neutralization Centre of the Provincial Royal Gendarmerie in Banteay_**
**_Meanchey._**

Another important and productive measure is the
drug addict education and neutralisation program being
conducted by the provincial Royal Gendarmeries of
Banteay Meanchey and Battambang. Establishment of
such a project in other places would be good, as this
measure is running well and has support from many
levels in society.

53


-----

Prevention and suppression of various offences
require closer cooperation among all relevant competent
authorities, especially full participation by the Royal
Gendarmerie. For this rather complicated task,
restoration of the Royal Gendarmerie's full role as
judicial police would be necessary and this has to be
done as soon as possible, especially the inclusion of this
role within the Penal Code of the Kingdom of Cambodia.

on 20 June 2006, Samdech Prime Minister **Hun Sen**
announced an eight-point order relating to measures to
strengthen security and social order. The RCAF has the
obligation to contribute to implementing the following
eight-point order successfully:

54


role within the Penal Code of the Kingdom of Cambodia.


-----

**First, must continue to uphold a sense of**
responsibility to strengthen peace, safety, rule of law,
social order to lead to the development of economy, social
affairs and to reduce poverty.

**Second, continue to increase the effectiveness of**
working to prevent all kinds of offences, especially
eliminating murder, armed robbery, kidnapping,
trafficking and drug use, trafficking of women and
children, and other illegal activities that cause fear in
society.

**_Samdech Prime Minister Hun Sen and a representative of EU-ASAC Project set fire to_**
**_the last pile of weapons for destruction in cooperation with the EU-ASAC (Flame of_**
**_Peace) at Takhmao in June 2006._**

**Third, continue to cooperate with the national and**
international community to increase cooperation to
prevent and counter all acts of terror and all forms of
subversion, both inside and outside the country.

55


-----

**Fourth, must thoroughly implement the Control of**
Weapons, Explosives and Ammunition Law passed on 26
April 2005 by the National Assembly.

**Fifth, strengthen the control of weapons and**
ammunition in all units to especially reduce the
unnecessary use of weapons, and weapons must be
secured in the safest place. All offences involving the use
of weapons must be strictly punished in accordance with
the law.

**Sixth, continue to search for, confiscate and**
destroy all kinds of weapons and explosives left over from
wartime including those being hidden and illegally used
by criminals. Also, control, prevention and timely
suppression of the circulation of illegal weapons and
explosives from place to place must be enhanced.

**Seventh, please all compatriots understand that**
weapons are a primary instrument and source to provoke
violence and crime that affect social security and safety,
especially the day-to-day livelihood of the people.
Therefore, handing in weapons or informing competent
authorities about weapons caches both contribute to the
maintenance of harmony, peace and safety for ourselves,
our families, our community and our entire national
society.

**Eighth, for government servants, military officers,**
police officers, and Royal Gendarmes who are permitted
by the new sub-decree to possess pistols for self-defense
must secure them well, not allowing children, nephews
or nieces, brothers or sisters, relative or friends to use
these weapons for whatever purposes.

56


-----

**POLITICAL NEUTRALITY OF THE RCAF**

Every soldier is required to have willpower and a
high sense of dedication in the defense and construction
of the country. This willpower can be developed as long
as the national interests are imbedded in the ideals of
those soldiers. Neutrality within the RCAF remains a
priority in the RCAF reform process and a number of
measures will help drive this process to a better
realisation.

  - With continued demobilisation, lawful recruitment
can increase new forces within the RCAF in the
future in accordance with the RCAF General
Statute Law. This measure must be conducted
through a reserve system or compulsory military
service law.

  - All soldiers, no matter at what level, must be
retired according to the retirement age or be
included in the demobilisation plan or, if necessary,
be retired early before the retirement age.

  - Training and education must be centred on effort
to instil military knowledge as much as possible in
soldiers and turn them into professional soldiers.
Indoctrinating the ideals of loving nation, religion,
king and loyalty to the Royal Government and
democratic values is very necessary.

**REDUCING DEFENSE FORCES**

In the DWP2000, the Royal Government decided to
have 55,000 military personnel demobilised since 1999.
This measure has gradually been implemented and
encountered an interruption in 2002 with the remaining

57


-----

number of 15,000 soldiers yet to be demobilised. The
DWP2000, the RDSND2002, and the political agendas of
the 3[rd] Term Government put an emphasis on an
intention to have an army with appropriate size and
quality. If we look closely at the general security
situation and requirements for national defense, both
now and in the future, we find that the Kingdom of
Cambodia is able to downsize military forces according to
the following measures:

  - Reducing the size of the defense force in five years’
time involves principally the discharge of category
two soldiers. Based on State legal procedures and
policy on armed forces reform, the Royal
Government, especially the Ministry of Economy
and Finance, must manage and make the
discharge of this category of soldiers go quicker;
otherwise, this problem would affect the
organisation of new structures, development of
human resources and, in particular, the
implementation of the compulsory military service
law.

  - Clearly determine the overall number of defense
force personnel needed for retention rather than
the number to be reduced. To balance the use of
the state budget, to adapt to the economic
situation and based on the needs for the defense of
the homeland, the RCAF will reduce the number of
military personnel by 25 to 30 percent more by the
year 2010.

  - Removing soldiers from the defense payroll must
be done at all levels, even if Generals. In addition,
discrimination based on previous background and
affiliations must be avoided.

58


-----

 - Each soldier must receive vocational training if
needed, or any support based on their actual living
situation prior to demobilisation. Vocational
training for soldiers to be discharged from the
military payroll provides basic knowledge as a tool
to conduct small scale business and encourage
them to take early retirement.

**_Ministry of National Defense and RCAF High Command leaders at the opening_**
**_ceremony of the RCAF 5-Year Work Achievement Review (2000-2004) and Future 5-_**
**_Year Objectives (2005-2009)._**

 - Retirement must be implemented according to the
law already in force. Taking early retirement
should be encouraged.

 - If possible, the promotion of generals and other
senior officers must be reduced to the maximum
extent or thoroughly controlled in order to
maintain the balance between Senior Officers and

59


-----

soldiers. A number of methods might be employed
such as retirement, stopping rank promotion
according to position, creating temporary or
honorary rank in case of political pressure,
rotating officers more often to increase experience,
and promoting correctly according to the law and
time in rank. If necessary, amendments must be
made to the RCAF General Statute Law on
Promoting Officers of General Rank by defining the
time in rank requirement.

  - The RCAF should thoroughly reconsider the
equality of gender. Important principles are
providing women equal value to that of men within
the defense force in terms of selection,
performance, rank promotion and benefits.

  - When the demobilisation process has progressively
moved forward toward the size of military forces
needed for retention, the RCAF needs to replenish
10 percent by new recruits until the year 2010,
which will be implemented under the compulsory
military service law or reserve system.

**FORCE DEVELOPMENT**

Units and locations of the RCAF at the present
time must continue to be reorganised. According to the
above demobilisation principle, the number of all types of
units will be reduced. However, the highest size of unit to
retain is Brigade level; and it is very appropriate that we
think about the military equipment, mobility, command
and control. Of the overall number of forces to be
continuously reduced, 80 percent or four-fifths are
operational forces, and 20 percent or the remaining one
60


-----

fifth are command and control forces at central
headquarters and at military regions and some other
specialised forces. An appropriate quality must be
considered for preparing military forces in each Service
(Army, Navy, Air Force): 10 percent are command and
control forces; 50 percent operational forces (infantry,
tank ..., etc); 20 percent supporting forces (artillery, air
Defense, engineering ..., etc), and 20 percent logistic
forces. A number of intervention units must always be
retained.

**_HE Gen Meas Sophea, Deputy Commander-in-Chief and Commander of Army,_**
**_reviews Armored Unit troops._**

When the number of military personnel is reduced
to the number needed for retention and when the
compulsory military service law comes into effect, the
RCAF will be able to recruit new forces every year.
Recruiting new recruits must be in balance with the
number to leave the military payroll and in accordance
with all principles of the implementation of the

61


-----

compulsory military service law. The principles of
implementing the compulsory military service law will be
described in detail later in this chapter.

**_HE Gen Meas Sophea, Deputy Commander-in-Chief and Commander of Army,_**
**_awards course insignia to 4[th] Airborne Commando Training Course students._**

The defined military strategies, a flexible and
controlled response, must be considered for force
deployment. In this context, regular and intervention
units must have suitable locations, roads for
communication to support force mobility, abilities to
intervene in time, and favourable conditions for living,
training and agricultural production. In addition, effort
must be made to eliminate the trend to focussing
attention only on areas that are popular or favoured.

In peacetime, regular forces must be cared for and
nurtured. Therefore, constant responsibilities for local
areas must be given to the Sub-Operational Zones of the

62


-----

provinces and cities. District military units with Royal
Gendarmerie can work together within the area of their
responsibility and, for the front-line areas, they must be
the responsibility of to border protection units in
cooperation with Sub-Operational Zones and other
authorities.

**REORGANISING STRUCTURE AND BUREAUCRACY**

The current RCAF structure needs to be
reorganised; however, the process of this restructuring
requires cooperation and full support from relevant
institutions of the Royal Government. In addition, RCAF
reform must be aligned and balanced with other security
institutions.

We have observed that RCAF reform is the policy
and responsibility of the Royal Government with some
relevant state institutions and this requires genuine and
mutual cooperation among those state institutions. The
power of the RCAF Reform Council at present only covers
the Ministry of National Defense and does not include
other institutions. Therefore, in order to increase the
effectiveness and to maintain the balance of reform, the
National Armed Forces Reform Council is the institution
that has authority to cover various relevant agencies.

Up to now, the RCAF reform process had
encountered obstacles because the structure of military
institutions and working systems remains complicated.
Reorganising the structure at lower units has been
successful, making the structure of those units suitable
to practical needs and increased effectiveness of force
management. Nevertheless, the hierarchy of higher levels,
especially those between the Ministry of National Defense

63


-----

and the High Command and the headquarters of the
three Services, needs to be reformed.

**REFORMING EDUCATION AND TRAINING**

According to measures defined in the DWP2000,
the RCAF has tried to improve its military training
systems, including the establishment of three levels of
training career soldiers (cadet officers, command and
staff, and strategic studies). Education through these
three levels will endow military officers with military
professionalism, sufficient ability to perform their roles
and duties, skills in leadership and command in units,
and sufficient values to participate in international
circles.

**_Training activity at the Army NCO School, Pich Nil._**

However, the RCAF’s education and training
systems currently requires further improvements in
order to make the development of human resources more
effective and of higher quality. Either the Ministry of

64


-----

National Defense or the High Command must jointly
consider a number of aspects as follows:

  - The control of educational institutions for career
soldiers is in disarray. On referring to the current
difficulties and to increase the effectiveness of
developing human resources, all training
institutions should be consolidated under a single
organisation.

**_HE GEN Pol Saroeun, Deputy Commander-in-Chief and Chief of Joint Staff,_**
**_inspecting the Engineering Unit’s demining training. -_**

  - The Ministry of National Defense should seek
support from the Royal Government to promote
some educational institutions for career soldiers in
an attempt to align these with the state’s
educational system and to international standards.
The Cambodian Military Institute (CMI), Russei
Keo, will be transformed to the Cambodian
Defense University. Its subordinates will also be

65


-----

reformed; for example, the Command and Staff
Training Centre, Centre will be promoted to the
Command and Staff College, the Foreign Language
and General Knowledge Centre and the Strategy
Study Centre are both turned into Institutes
respectively. This reform not only advances
education in the military, but it also paves the way
for Cambodia to be able to receive foreign military
students for training. The exchange of military
education with foreign countries will be inevitable
in the future.

**_Training activity at the Army NCO School, Pich Nil._**

- The training syllabus for the educational
institutions for career soldiers must be modernised
to be consistent with the evolution of the
international environment and with the
development of the RCAF. Institutions responsible
for educational and training tasks must, in
cooperation with skilful military officers trained
overseas or with foreign experts in Cambodia, try

66


in the future.


-----

to update the training syllabus. Developing the
syllabus will also hasten opportunities for
exchanging military students with foreign
countries.


**_HE General Ke Kim Yan, Commander-in-Chief of_**
**_the RCAF, presenting a promotion course sword to_**
**_the Dux of the Cadet Officer Course._**


  - Enhancing
instructors’ abilities
is a key factor when
institutions and the
training syllabus are
upgraded. English
training for instructtors must be
encouraged, which
serves as an
important basis for
further self-study
and enables them to
undertake research
through various
Info-rmation Technology systems.
Officers who have
completed career
soldier training
abroad must spend
a period of time in
institutions of
education and
training  to  share


their knowledge or take part in developing the
training syllabus. Those in charge of each
educational and training institution for career
soldiers must try to communicate with circles
outside their own institutions to invite experienced

67


-----

speakers to deliver lectures as part of their
training program.

- The training program for cadet officers has been
extended to 4 years. The extension of this program
aims at allowing education to be equivalent to an
international standard and at allowing officers’ to
be equipped with a Batchelor degree recognised by
the Royal Government. But, given that the training
syllabus and capacity of the school to receive
students is limited, study at the Tmart Thpong
Officers School is only 3 years, and the final years,
cadet officer students must pursue specialist skills
study at the Combined Arms Officers School, Tlok
Tasek. However, cadet officer students’ study
remains 4 years.

- The Army Non-Commissioned Officers School, Pich
Nil, must be changed to the Army Training Centre.
This centre has an important and extensive role in
training new recruits. This centre can also be used
as a military training facility for an entire Battalion.
Refresher (supplementary) training at units can be
conducted in training schools at military regions.

- Understanding the Kingdom of Cambodia's defense
policy is an important factor for every soldier to
carry out their roles and duties as stated by
Samdech Prime Minister Hun Sen who has always
given advice to advocate the Defense White Paper
as a compass. Defense policy education, especially
the DWP guidelines, must be conducted at all
levels of the defense hierarchy through direct
dissemination by experts dealing with this matter,
television and radio systems and other relevant
methods. Conducting a seminar or a conference to

68


-----

discuss specific strategic guidelines one by one will
help encourage practical implementation of those
principles more effectively and successfully.

**_HE Deputy Prime Minister Tea Banh and HE French Ambassador to Cambodia_**
**_preside at the inauguration ceremony for buildings renovated with assistance from the_**
**_Republic of France at the Kambol Royal Gendarmerie Training School._**

  - In the future, if possible, simulator systems should
be used for training—a way to help reduce
expenditure on training resources.

**REFORMING THE LOGISTICS-FINANCE SYSTEM**

No matter what strategic initiatives are carried out,
financial support is always required. Because we have a
weak management system for national defense resources
coupled with a limited budget, there have been
interruptions and inertia in some areas of the reform
process. A number of measures can be used in this
reform:

69


-----

  - Create priorities for expenditure every year. This
will facilitate preparation of realistic budgets and
spending objectively.

  - Permit the defense force to have the right to
conduct businesses, especially in the field of agroindustry with respect to the state law.

  - Supplies must be delivered directly to units with
transfer and handover among parties concerned of
the Ministry, the High Command and the receiving
unit. The receiving unit must, avoiding
misappropriation, distribute all supply
entitlements as directed. Authorised qualities of
supplies must be distributed to the recipient units
and a regular audit must be done.

  - Reduce unnecessary procedures, thus reducing
waste, saving time and promoting transparency.

**IMPROVING SOLDIERS’ LIVELIHOOD**

The national defense budget is small in amount, if
compared to the present size of the defense force. The
budget condition can be improved when there are further
demobilisations. Nevertheless, the Royal Government
must always maintain and a stable defense budget while
the Ministry of National Defense is undertaking
demobilisation. The budget gained from demobilisation
will be further used in:

  - Building military bases,
  - Training,
  - Improving soldiers’ living conditions by raising
salary equivalent to those of various civil agencies,

70


-----

encouraging them to raise livestock and do other
farming, etc.
  - Expanding health services at military regions,
enabling them to provide support to soldiers as
well as local people.

**MAINTENANCE OF MILITARY EQUIPMENT**

Gradual deterioration of military equipment is a
concern and challenge to strengthening the capability of
the armed forces. The RCAF has primary roles in
defending sovereignty and territorial integrity. Military
equipment is an essential resource for building strong
military capability to ensure a positive response to the
Defense of the homeland. It is true that when we have
sufficient forces and capability, any external
encroachments will definitely be overcome.

71


**_HE LTGEN Kun Kim, Deputy Commander-in-Chief of the RCAF presides at the_**


-----

As the Royal Government is presently facing
difficulties in improving the national economy, the
procurement of new military equipment is not possible.
Therefore, the primary approach to solve this problem is
to regularly maintain current military equipment. The
priority of national defense at this time is to focus on the
protection of land borders and on strengthening of
maritime security, which requires the permanent
presence of military forces and capabilities to operate
constantly.

**_The Royal Cambodian Air Force regularly maintains military equipment and material_**
**_although facing resource shortages._**

The Ministry of National Defense and the High
Command, together with the Ministry of Economy and
Finance, must jointly solve this problem and seek
whatever means to immediately repair a number of major
equipments such as vessels, tanks, artillery, aircraft and
other modes of transport. Following repair, continued
maintenance of these equipments for constant
operations must be undertaken. Unit commanders must

72


-----

use their assets appropriately and with a high sense of
responsibility.

The DWP2000 has already mentioned that creative
approaches and improvisation are possible in some areas
for military materials, especially in the field of transport,
mobility, communication, etc. Utilising civil materials for
military purposes would be favourable to procurement,
repair and maintenance and acquisition of spare parts.
In addition, the utilisation would be easy and repair
could be made available at military workshops and at
various facilities almost everywhere. For example, a
number of Toyota vehicles are being used by the Royal

**_RCAF soldiers are preparing and securing weapons and ordnance in a safe armory_**
**_built in cooperation with the EU-ASAC Project._**

Gendarmerie for its mobility and operations. It should
also be the same for modes of communication — instead
of using military communication equipment, civil
communication radio, telephone, facsimile, and email
would be an optimum alternative for sending information.
The possibility of maintaining materials by contracting

73


-----

with a private company should also be taken into
consideration. The outsourcing of maintenance to civilian
contractors could be also one option.

The burning down of ammunition warehouses in
Battambang in early 2005 was a reminder that serious
consideration must be given to military equipment
warehouse safety. The RCAF must further increase its
sense of responsibility for maintaining materials,
weapons and ammunition by strengthening the safety at
storage facilities. In addition, the quality of stored
munitions must be rechecked and, if necessary, they
must be destroyed to avoid any incident.

Nevertheless, effort to seek external assistance
remains important for the rehabilitation of important
military materials that are in poor condition. The
Ministry of National Defense as well as the High
Command must try to further expand cooperation with
friendly countries in this area, particularly the building
of a slipway at the Ream Base, the Army workshop, the
Air Force workshop and communication capabilities, etc.

**MILITARY BASES**

Bases are important facilities to command and
control forces at units regularly and effectively. Bases
facilitate assembly, control, movement of forces, training,
living, strengthening discipline and morality, health
services, etc.

Over the past five years, the construction of
suitable bases has encountered great difficulties due to
the lack of funds. The effort of maintaining the status
quo has been addressed by improvisation at local units,
by donation of generous people, and support from the

74


-----

Ministry of National Defense of the People’s Republic of
China, but the regulation of forces has not been
standardised. The Ministry of National Defense and the
Ministry of Economy and Finance must consult with
each other to seek ways to solve this problem and funds
obtained from demobilisation must be given to the
Ministry of National Defense for the construction of
bases.

**SELF-RELIANCE EFFORTS**

So far, the Royal Government has provided some
opportunities for the RCAF to develop and support its

**_HE Sok An, Deputy Prime Minister, Minister in Charge of the Council of Ministers,_**
**_and HE General Ke Kim Yan, RCAF Commander-in-Chief (right), sign a friendship_**
**_alliance agreement between the Office of the Council of Ministers and RCAF High_**
**_Command._**

units, especially through provision of land to use as
development areas. In addition to cultivation and raising
livestock at units, seeking investments in the
development areas is very essential. Units will benefit by
effort to attract investment for common interests with
accountability in place, these investment partnerships

75


-----

might be domestic private companies or foreign ones. In
addition, land for defense locations and development
areas must be registered properly for ownership in order
to clear any suspicion concerning investments and to
avoid land disputes with local villagers and other milieus
in the future.

However, what’s more important than this is the
encouragement to military forces to have rights and
abilities to conduct medium scale businesses for their
own support benefits and unit development. Also, the
Royal Government has already made decisions on the
establishment of friendship alliances between RCAF
units and a number of state institutions through which
the military units will have support from those state
institutions in the effort to develop their livelihood.

**INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY**

The Revolution of the Military Affairs has
progressed quickly over the past decades. The computer
era has made the management, command and control,
operations, communication and force development of
military forces in the world dependent more on modern
technology and less on the use of manpower.

Technology in Cambodia at present has advanced
remarkably. The RCAF can take advantages of using
modern technology such as computers, email and
internet systems, etc as a means that is effective and
timely for the headquarters working processes, command
and control,  communication,  study  and research, etc.
Each and every officer must acknowledge the importance
of technology and pay attention to developing knowledge
in this area, especially knowledge of the English
language which is essential for using equipment properly.

76


-----

**_RCAF Officers receiving computer training at the Ministry of National Defense Policy_**

Furthermore, knowledge and existence of these
capabilities will be useful for international relations,
especially for participation in peacekeeping operations as
well as education and training abroad.

**RELIEF OPERATIONS**

77


A decrease in
rain forests, coupled
with an earth
climate change,
makes Cambodia
en-counter natural
disasters almost
every year. Floods
and droughts are
key issues. Until
now, the RCAF has
been a very
important force  for


-----

rescuing local people when facing a natural crisis by
providing assistance such as building embankments
along river and stream banks, evacuating civilians to safe
areas, providing protection and security, and
maintenance and reconstruction of damaged
infrastructure, etc.

**_RCAF Engineers prepare to rescue people during a natural disaster._**

The RCAF has appropriate forces to undertake this
duty. Those forces include Special Forces, Royal
Gendarmerie, Engineering, Army, Navy and Air Force.
Apart from seeking additional materials from foreign
partners, military forces need another important
capability that can make the performance of their duties
effective and timely; that is, constant preparedness. This
constant preparedness requires relevant units to have
manpower for operations, materials available, a means of
transport, and tactics for fulfilling duties. Even better, all
relevant units, together with civil institutions, must
conduct a joint relief operations exercise at least once per
year so that the response to real situations will be

78


-----

performed in time and effectively. In addition, the
Ministry of National Defense and the High Command
should consider the preparation of capability for a small
team that can undertake overseas operations in the
future.

**REQUIREMENTS FOR A LEGAL FRAMEWORK**

Although the Royal Government has a number of
laws, royal decrees and sub-decrees for strengthening
the RCAF, we have not had sufficient laws for the
purpose of defense. Therefore, it is necessary to prepare
some new laws and amend existing laws in response to
the evolving situation in national society and in the
international arena.

**Necessity** **for** **Developing** **New** **Law** **(on**
**Compulsory Military Service): It has been over 10 years**
since 1993 up to the present but the CMS Law or some
other laws to encourage defense service for the
motherland have not been established to make people
understand their obligation toward the nation and,
especially, to recruit new soldiers. The implementation of
the General Statute Law for RCAF Soldiers has resulted
in an increase in officers and a decrease in soldiers.
There is an imbalance between officers and soldiers. As a
practical example, the Army’s report released in the 5
Year Work Achievement Review reveals that officers
account for up to 77 percent of the force.

Therefore, to reform our RCAF to be a core force for
defending the nation, territorial integrity and other
cooperation, it is only the CMS Law that can solve this
problem. Although the CMS Law is part of strengthening
the rule of law and it is a magnificent mechanism to
awaken people to exercising their duties in the cause of

79


-----

defending the motherland and to have opportunities to
fulfil important duties as honoured citizens and to
expressing real good-will toward their homeland, the
implementation of this law after it has been approved by
the National Assembly must be weighed according to the
real situation, such as:

**In Peacetime: Although this law is compulsory in**
nature, the practical implementation is based only
on the needs. According to predictions, within 5
years’ time the RCAF needs new personnel to
balance the discharge of soldiers each year.

**In Crisis: The nation might need more new soldiers**
than this when the country encounters various
crises, including major natural disasters.
Nevertheless, the implementation must be in the
framework of law.

**In Wartime: the CMS Law must be implemented**
100 percent and vigorously to respond to a state of
emergency. Under such circumstances, the required
implementation might be greater than this and even
lead to conscription.

However, the establishment of the CMS Law has
been misunderstood and is causing concern. Therefore,
we need many approaches to take action in educating
the public to understand the law; such as:

  - Dispel concern or fears that it forces youth to fulfil
an unwanted job; otherwise, they would be
punished.

  - The military service must not be an activity
affecting the development of human resources or
the vocational training of youth.

80


-----

  - Political issues and activities of political parties
must be set aside from the military service.

  - Corruption or exploiting military service for
personal interests must be prevented.

Apart from the military service law, the RCAF
must consider the creation of a reserve system as an
important source of new forces in the future. The
creation of reserve forces is being carried out in a large
number of countries because it is an effective measure
for rotating military forces with less expenditure and
more people receive military knowledge as a tool needed
when the country in crisis. When the support of defense
force living conditions improves, recruiting reserve forces
will be conducted on a voluntary basis, and various
consequences can be avoided. When there is a shortfall
in the active forces of the RCAF, reserve forces might be
mobilised as active forces. The reserve system shall be
applied under the CMS Law with some provisions added.
In addition, we are able to minimise expenditure on
salary, training and other living support costs when the
system is in place.

Another option to cost-effectively increase RCAF
flexibility is to introduce time contracted soldiers with
contract times from 2 to 20 years. Soldiers under
contract might be selected for a period of time and leave
after fulfilling their obligations without legal rights for a
pension but receive instead a comparatively smaller
severance pay.

**Further Law Development: In order to strengthen**
the position of the RCAF in a democratic state system,
the legal coverage of daily duties as well as military
discipline has to be developed such as a military

81


-----

disciplinary act, law on the military court, law on a
parliamentarian ombudsman as a last resort to solve
problems occurring between soldiers and commanders, a
legal framework for a military appeal order to ensure the
human rights of every soldier, and legal frameworks for
international operations etc.

**INTERNATIONAL COOPERATION**

According to the strategic objectives of national
defense already described in Chapter 3, the RCAF will
increase its attention to strengthening military
cooperation with various friendly countries. This military
cooperation must be done with a non-political and nonideological bias and be based on the spirit of respecting
mutual interests. The RCAF at the present time as well
as in the short and medium term future needs essential
international support in some important fields to sustain
its military reform.

Those important fields include:

  - Human resource development for military
personnel at operational and strategic levels.

**_HE LTGEN Moeung Samphan (centre), Secretary of State of Defense, presides at the_**
**_handover ceremony for a 5-story general medical consultation building._**

  - Strengthening border protection capabilities,
especially some specialty capabilities to prevent
and suppress all forms of transnational crime.

  - Strong capabilities in preventing and countering
terrorism.

  - Broader military capability to fulfil duties in time of
peace (engineering, demining, relief operations and
other humanitarian operations).

  - Increasing officers’ abilities in law awareness.

83


-----

  - Supporting efforts to increase Navy’s operational
capabilities, especially making some of Navy’s
important equipment operational.

  - Developing knowledge of foreign languages and
Information Technology.

Since 1993, military cooperation with foreigners
has gradually progressed, especially in the field of
human resource development and other technical
assistance. However, the lack of specific coordination
with all military cooperation programs has sometimes
resulted in assistance centred only on one area. In
addition, resource restrictions of donors and their linking
of assistance for political reasons have resulted in
stagnation of some military cooperation programs or to
be of insignificant scope.

**PEACEKEEPING CAPABILITY**

At present as well as in the future, the RCAF is
striving to build its prestige in the international arena. A
role in peacekeeping operations is one opportunity to
which the RCAF can contribute in an effort to strengthen
peace and security in the region and throughout the
world.

The RCAF must also consider developing a number
of capabilities to contribute to international cooperation.
As requested by the United Nations, the RCAF has
participated in UN peace missions in Africa in two
important areas: demining and military observers. A

from this, the RCAF has some other special capabilities
that might be employed in such missions; including
engineering, first aid, civil police, and so forth.

Nevertheless,
in order to
enhance these
capabilities more
effectively, cooperation and support from experienced friendly
countries are
needed. The **_Departure of the Demining Company soldiers for_**

mittee for force deployment to UN peacekeeping missions
was established as a national mechanism to coordinate
and liaise with the UN as well as various national and
international agencies. A centre must also be established
to develop human resources for peacekeeping missions.
The Cambodian Military Institute can be a suitable place
for education and training, and the implementation of a
program can be progressed in cooperation with voluntary
friendly countries.

**CHAPTER 5**
**MECHANISMS OF GOVERNANCE**

Ultimately, realisation of the strategic plan
demands strong determination, competent leadership,
viable structures, meticulous management, and suitable
resources. A lack of understanding about this defense
policy, coupled with an absence of cooperation by
relevant institutions, might hamper the achievement of
implementing this Defense White Paper’s strategic
guidelines. Therefore, some of the following factors must
be taken into consideration in an attempt to ensure the
success of the above-stated strategic plan.

**TRANSPARENCY**

Good governance, the Royal Government’s
fundamental objective, needs transparency. All strategic
objectives written in the Defense White Paper depend
completely on the strengthening of transparency for
implementation. Another main support for transparency
is a military law system. The need for further
strengthening laws as described in chapter 4 not only
aligns with international norms but it is also necessary
for every soldier.

Over the past 10 years, the RCAF has one main
objective: to prepare itself into a high quality and
professional defense force. A long period of time has
passed and we have not yet achieved our objectives.
Although significant progress has been made, some
areas of inertia have disrupted or slowed the reform

process, where some of which also include the personnel
management. Leaders at all levels must immediately
begin to completely eliminate all not yet transparent
management of personnel, including the ghost soldiers.
While the RCAF faces increasing numbers of senior
military officers, the Ministry of National Defense and the
High Command must pay attention to solving this
problem by having a more detailed and transparent
mechanism to check and control the promotion of
officers. Promoting rank or awarding decorations of
honour must be done based on real requirements and
the rule of law, avoiding nepotism and elevating the
value of those awards. The Royal Government’s relevant
institutions, especially the Ministry of Economy and
Finance, must cooperate more closely with the Ministry
of National Defense to seek ways for the effective
implementation of the Pensions Law so that we can
significantly reduce the number of officers who reach
retirement age.

The defense budget is small in amount if compared
to the size of current forces. We hope that keeping a
stable defense budget for a smaller defense force in the
future will facilitate efforts to make the RCAF become a
qualified and professional defense force. Nevertheless,
the utility of this scarce resource in a transparent
manner is essential. Building this transparency requires
the rigorous management of expenditure and income. All
forms of expenditure must absolutely be in accordance
with the defined needs and annual priorities of
expenditure.

**MONITORING PROGRESS**

Creating strategic principles is not too difficult, but
what is vital is the implementation. Therefore, in order to
positively and successfully ensure the implementation of
the Royal Government’s defense policy, all relevant
ministries and agencies of the Royal Government must
have a clear understanding of the strategic objectives of
the Defense White Paper; otherwise, it would lead to
misunderstanding, inaction and eventually failure.

Certainly, all hierarchical levels of the RCAF must
have a clear understanding of all strategic guidelines in
the Defense White Paper. The Ministry of National
Defense must task the Defense White Paper Working
Group to promote awareness of the defense policy to all
parts of the RCAF, including military educational and

89


-----

training institutions. This dissemination must be
persistent even if conducted slowly and surely. Apart
from the DWP, the Working Group should seek more
materials such as an executive summary booklet, the
use of electronic equipment, etc, for dissemination
campaigns to enhance the degree of understanding.

The DWP sets forth a lot of strategic initiatives for
the RCAF to implement. Most descriptions of each
measure are comprehensive in nature. Therefore, for
practical implementation, more detailed planning is
needed. For assistance and as a tool in preparing plans
of action, the Ministry of National Defense and the High
Command must organise seminars or conferences to
provide insights of those selected strategic initiatives, one
at a time, so they may be interpreted in depth. The
discussion, if possible, should have a timetable set for
the implementation of each initiative. Other perspectives
emerging from the discussion can serve as better
recommendations for the Ministry of National Defense
and the High Command to successfully realise the
implementation of the Royal Government’s defense policy.
This task might also need assistance from other relevant
ministries and foreign partners.

The Ministry of National Defense as well as the
High Command must, through mechanisms of regular
checks and control, judge the outcomes of the
implementation of the strategic initiatives. The DWP
Implementation Working Group established in 2002
remains effective; this group has fulfilled its duties well
as was the case leading to the development of the
DSR2002. Therefore, this Working Group can continue
to further expand its work to monitor the implementation

-----

of the DWP 2006 principles. This Working Group must
initiate additional methods for its monitoring such as
organising seminars or conferences, making reports on
the results of implementation, disseminating the results
on media systems (radio, television, defense magazine)
etc.

**ACCOUNTABILITY FOR IMPLEMENTATION**

Implementation of every strategic measure always
demands accountability according to individual roles.
Unit commanders, Military Region commanders, Service
commanders, etc, must pay attention to monitoring the
implementation of measures that are their responsibility,
and try to do their utmost to seek solutions to any
challenges and inactivity hindering the realisation of
missions. The Ministry of National Defense must try to
make resources available to lower units so that they will
have a greater possibility of success. The Ministry of
Economy and Finance—a crucial source to ensure the
sustainability for realisation of objectives—must increase
its attention to all difficulties being faced by the RCAF.
This institution, in close cooperation with the Ministry of
National Defense and other relevant institutions must
seek a clear understanding of the root and reality of
problems and help seek recommendations and methods
to solve them quickly and in time. Based on the spirit of
close cooperation among relevant ministries and
institutions, the RCAF will be able to accomplish its
mission smoothly.
