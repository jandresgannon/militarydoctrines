**1. Introduction**

National Security Concept (hereinafter – Concept) is a document based on the State threat
analysis, stating strategic principles of prevention of state threats, priorities and measures,
which must be taken into account when executing new political planning documents,
legislative enactments and action plans in the area of national security.

State threats, such as disasters (storms, intensive rainstorms, intensive snowing,
earthquakes, flood, fire, leakage of dangerous substances, industrial accidents, dangerous
infectious diseases, public disorders, etc.) issues must be resolved within the framework of
civil security system, thus, these risks and threats are enlisted in the State Civil Security
Plan.

Measures carried out by and mutual co-operation of state institutions by working out and
implementing the national security policy are based on priorities set forth in the Concept.
On the basis of the priorities determined in this Concept, the Cabinet of Ministers works
out the National Security Plan, which includes specific state threat neutralisation and
prevention measures and means.

**2. National Security and National Security Policy**

**2.1. Description of the notion of National Security**

National Security is a condition achieved as a result of unified and determined state and
public measures, granting independence of the country, its constitutional system and
territorial integrity, perspective of development for public freedom, welfare and stability.

Adequate condition of the state security may be achieved by systematic planning and
implementation of unified and determined national security policy, developing effective
national security institutions and defence forces structures adequate for modern security
environment, observing international obligations of Latvia, as well as continuing active
participation in Europe and Transatlantic security and defence institution.

Precondition of particular importance for successful implementation of the National
Security Policy has become social understanding of the goals stated in the Concept, as well
as its participation and support in achieving these goals.

Achieving of goals of the National Security Policy shall be responsibility of all institutions
and people of the country. Granting of national security shall be principal obligation of the
state.

**2.2. Description of National Security Policy**

National Security Policy is totality of domestic and foreign policy measures with the
purpose of establishing, assessment, overcoming threats and potential risk factors, and
reduction of their eventual negative impact. When implementing national security policy,
Latvia observes principles of international rights, contained in the Charter of the United
Nations, documents of the European Security and Cooperation Organization, as well as
international agreements binding to Latvia. National Security Policy of Latvia is
implemented, avoiding endangering of other countries.

Status of the member state of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (hereinafter referred
to as NATO) and European Union (hereinafter referred to as EU) continues to improve
security environment in Latvia, minimizing foreign military and political threats. Purpose of
Latvia is in cooperation with partners to strengthen common European security space.
Participation of Latvia in the international peace establishing and peace keeping
operations, as well as in EU international civil missions (EU Rule of Law in Kosovo (EULEX
Kosovo), EU Monitoring Mission in Georgia (EUMM Georgia), EU Police Mission in
Afghanistan (EUPOL Afghanistan)) has provided opportunity for the country to involve in
global political processes and receive allies’ support for implementation of national security
interests. Latvia has interest to take active part in development of international security
policy within international organizations, including participation in development of the
NATO Strategic Concept. It is important to ensure that, under conditions of modern
strategic environment, the new NATO Strategic Concept reflects current situation in the
area of security and its challenges.

Latvia together with its partners and allies encounters threats and challenges for their
security, expanding regional forces, unfriendly countries, having nuclear weapons in their
arms, threats of information technologies and threats of increasing competition for natural
resources. The Latvian National Security is tightly related to global security, thus,
balancing of possible risks with the security policy implemented by Latvia shall be of high
importance, performing it in close collaboration with allies and partners of Latvia. When
responding to the current threats, eventual future threats shall also be taken into account.

During the recent years, some positive changes have occurred in the foreign and domestic
environment of Latvia. However, there are still some eventual military risks, threats of
foreign intelligence and secret services, risks of split civil society, economic interests,
extremist and radically oriented organizations, international terrorism, as well as threats
caused by information technologies.


-----

So that the state would be able to effectively prevent and overcome potential threats to
national security, capacity of management of general threats shall be enhanced. Planned,
harmonized and coordinated mutual civil-military cooperation of the state security
institutions, National Armed Forces (NAF) and public still shall be considered one of the
most significant preconditions for effective legal capacity of Latvia in preventing,
overcoming threats and liquidation of its consequences both on its own and with assistance
under Section 5 of the North Atlantic Treaty.

**3 Priorities in prevention of threats to the national security**

**3.1 Prevention of military threats**

Detailed description of the state military threats according to the National Security Law is
provided in the Military Threat Analysis.

Currently Latvia has no direct military threats. Despite some events, which have raised
concerns on purposes of neighbouring states, for instance, military conflict in Georgia,
training of armed forces of the Russian Federation and the Republic of Byelorussia Ladoga
and Zapad 2009, security situation in the Baltic Sea region may be described as safe and
stable.

Basic strategic principle of the Latvian military security is participation in the NATO
Collective Defence System, which ensures that the possible military threats towards Latvia
shall be considered general threats to NATO.

In case of any threats to the country, NAF, in cooperation with armed forces of allies, shall
ensure security of Latvia’s mainland, sea aquatorium and air space. Strategic interests of
Latvia are related to further maintenance of alliance’s legal capacity and efficiency. In
addition to guaranties provided by collective defence, participation in NATO allows Latvia
to receive the following investments in its security: patrol of air space, common trainings
of allies on a regular basis, implementation of Lielvārde aerodrome modernization project.

Along with participation in NATO and EU, even greater effect to the security of Latvia is
caused by international security processes and contemporary security challenges. Since
security situation in Latvia cannot be separated from global security, responsibility of
Latvia for international security has increased, thus, increasing also necessity to cooperate
in strengthening thereof.

Development of EU and NATO, as well as ability of both organizations to supplement each
other in preventing international threats and resolving of crises is essential for Latvia.
Latvia supports development of EU military and civil ability, which enhances EU’s
contribution into the international security and efficient use of member states’ resources.

Furthermore, cooperation among the Baltic States, which is one of the main elements for
strengthening security and stability in the region and enhancing development and mutual
compatibility of armed forces in the Baltic States, is significant for Latvia.

In relation to Russia, Latvia considers significant enhancement of mutual trust, especially,
due to the fact that the Military Doctrine of the Russian Federation states increase of the
global role of NATO, expansion of alliance and development of its infrastructure in the
borderland of Russia as one of the threats. Latvia considers that cooperation between
NATO and Russia shall be a factor enhancing international security. Mutual cooperation in
future shall be based upon specific threat prevention or combating measures. Furthermore,
Latvia supports armament monitoring regimens improving international security and
maximum transparency in their implementation and observation.

Adequate resources shall be dedicated for performing defence tasks and strengthening of
NAF battling capabilities. At the same time, developing abilities of NAF, Latvia will attempt


-----

to participate in advantageous multinational projects, as well as to contribute to the
economy of Latvia, involving Latvia’s entrepreneurs in tenders organized by the Ministry of
Defence, attracting NATO investments and supporting development of new technologies
required for defence. Public support is essential for implementation of defence tasks.

Priorities of Latvia in prevention of military threats:

**Maintaining and development of NAF ability to fight**

To ensure implementation of the state defence tasks, priority of Latvia in the area of
defence shall be maintenance and development of adequate ability to fight of NAF for
protection of Latvian territory, as well as for strengthening general military ability within
collective defence and participation in international operations outside of the territory of
Latvia. Adequate resources shall be provided for ensuring of ability to fight of NAF.

**Participation of NAF in the international operations of NATO and EU**

Participation in the international operations, including NATO response forces, aiming to
prevent crises and their consequences, both enhances international security and stability
and allows NAF to improve their ability to fight and skills. In the near future, NATO
operation in Afghanistan will remain significant task of NATO, requiring contribution from
Latvia, as well. Latvia considers important to support comprehensive approach to such
operations so as the state under crisis is able to take responsibility on its security as soon
as possible.

**Organization of military training in the territory of the Baltic States**

The organization of joint military training with other NATO member states in the territory
of Latvia and other Baltic States is a crucial factor to ensure improvement and further
development of the battling capacities of the NAF. International military training is
required to maintain and develop ability to fight of NAF and to assess qualification level of
units and types of forces, as well as their ability to perform their tasks. Furthermore, NATO
training demonstrates public solidarity and enhances public support and understanding of
NATO purposes. In this aspect, the host nation support system within the framework of
which deployment of allied military forces must be ensured in the territory of Latvia is one
of the main tasks of national security that must be provided by Latvia. Responsible
institutions must ensure the maintenance of the host nation support system and must
carry out regular mutual coordination and training so that in case of necessity it would be
possible to rapidly deploy allied forces. Host nation support system is important not only in
case of military threats of the state, but also in prevention of the consequences of natural
and human-caused catastrophes and international training.

**3.2. Prevention of threats caused by foreign intelligence and security services**

Significant factor for national security threats shall be considered operation of foreign
intelligence and security services (hereinafter referred to as “the foreign intelligence
service”) in the territory of Latvia. Operation of foreign intelligence services against Latvia
and its interests may be divided into political, military and economic intelligence. Their
activities may be both directed against national security interests of Latvia and threats to
general security of NATO and EU.

Operation of foreign intelligence services in Latvia shall be regarded as active. Their
employees perform purposeful analysis of the publicly available information on any news in
Latvia's domestic policy, foreign policy, economics and development of armed forces, as
well as attempt to obtain pre-emptive operational information in relation to the
abovementioned issues. Thus, foreign intelligence services obtain information on decision
making processes in Latvian institutions and political environment, providing to these
countries advantage when planning their foreign policy, military and economic activities
with Latvia and the Baltic region, as well as Latvian domestic policy and measures of
influencing of public opinion in Latvia.


-----

Foreign intelligence services use as their sources of information both employees of their
diplomatic representations in Latvia and create networks of their agents and contact
persons among officials of authorities, who, thus, ensure to them experts’ assessment and
analysis on issues within the scope of interests of foreign intelligence services.
Furthermore, foreign intelligence services perform activities in Latvian information space
and public organization environment, thus, influencing their operation according to their
interests and enhancing popularisation of opinions non-loyal to the country.

Strategic purpose of Latvia shall be taking counterintelligence measures, identify
employees of intelligence services, their collaboration partners, circle of interest and
methods of operation to prevent any possible damage to Latvian national interests, as well
as to those of NATO and EU.

Priorities of Latvia for prevention of threats caused by foreign intelligence services:

**International cooperation**

Security institutions of the state of Latvia (Constitution Protection Bureau of the Republic
of Latvia, Security Police and Military Intelligence and Security Service) must cooperate
with intelligence services of other NATO and EU member states for the purpose of timely
identification of activities of foreign intelligence service employees in the territory of Latvia
or against its objects of interest abroad that are dangerous for security interests of Latvia,
NATO and EU. State security institutions must enhance information and experience
exchange with foreign partner services on methods and tactics for obtaining of
information, which may be used by foreign intelligence services. If required, Latvian state
security institutions must involve in common operations with foreign partner services to
prevent threats to security interests of Latvia, NATO and EU.

**Mutual cooperation of state security institutions and information exchange**

Security institutions of the state of Latvia must cooperate purposefully by ensuring
efficient exchange of strategic information and mutual coordination of strategic activities.
The State Security Institution Council, in which the leaders of all three state security
institutions are represented, must be used purposefully to determine the strategic work
priorities of state security institutions, to promote mutual information exchange, analysis
and use.

**Counterintelligence and state secret protection enhancement measures**

Headstone for preventing threats caused by foreign intelligence services shall be
considered an effective national counterintelligence and state secret protection system.
Purposeful development of the abovementioned system shall include both development
and improving of effective legislation and high quality inspections in relation to persons
applying for issuance of special permit to access to the state secret. State security
institutions shall ensure intensive control over conformity of development, storage,
circulation and procedure of use of a state secret object with requirements contained in
legal enactments, paying special attention to information classified by NATO and EU.
Significant precondition for state secret protection must be formation of awareness in
relation to necessity of protection of state secret in officials working with state secret.

**3.3. Prevention of threats to unity of civil society**

One of foundations of a civil society shall be considered successful social integration policy.
In order to prevent development of processes, which might hinder strengthening of civil
society and lead to splitting of society, the state must proceed with purposeful
implementation of the policy.

The Latvian language as the official language and an element consolidating society has
failed to become stable in several areas, for instance, in business and information
environment. It is expected that, in future, competition between languages will increase in


-----

Latvia, due to which the Latvian language may become into disadvantageous situation
comparing with other languages. This development of situation may enhance further
splitting of society by language principle. Separated information spaces reduce opportunity
of equally effective applying to entire society by the state, thus, specific part of the society
fails to acquire feeling of belonging to Latvia.

Society in Latvia is split also by the attitude towards specific historical issues. The different
attitudes influence cultural and political identity and global vision of specific groups of the
society, which may lead to mutual disagreements.

Regional development differences and risk of occurring of depressive regions can be
observed in Latvia, which may influence, for instance, Latgale District, where inequality of
socioeconomic development, ethnic content of population and some isolation from political
decision making processes of Latvia negatively supplement one another.

The abovementioned factors may cause potential threats to national security interests of
Latvia, intensified by the fact that there is no effective mechanism coordinating integration
of society, national minorities, naturalization and official language policy with clearly
defined areas of responsibility among specific state institutions. This is demonstrated by
the fact that no specific format for coordinated implementation of the abovementioned
issues has been established. As individual institutions, those institutions responsible for
implementation of integration and migration policy have been liquidated, while complete
achievement of goals established by the official language policy is endangered due to the
reduced funding from the state. Furthermore, it is aggravated by the trend that
informative space in Latvia fails to operate as a unified factor, and there is a risk of
splitting of informative space.

Due to continuation of uncertainty in relation to processes of integration of society, the
state’s ability to respond to these threats and their consequences will decrease. Those
countries, which, by investing assets, can attempt to create in Latvia cultural, educational,
language, informative and socioeconomic environment favourable to them, may acquire
even more significant influence.

Influence of a split society to national security may manifest itself in critical situations
when making and implementation of significant decisions may be difficult.

Strategic aim of Latvia is to enhance development of national and unitary state,
responsible civil society and body of citizens dedicated to the Latvian state.

Priorities of Latvia for prevention of threats caused by split society:

**Society integration policy**

Responsible state institutions must implement coordinated action at all levels of state
administration so that jointly with the sector of nongovernmental organizations long-term
society integration policy, which would be based on strengthening belonging to the state,
its basic values and state language as means of communication between groups of the
society from one side and maintaining and developing ethnical identity of all minorities in
Latvia, as well as representation of their interests on the other side, would be created. The
state must provide support for minority culture associations and non-governmental
organizations, offering opportunity for minorities to develop their cultural traditions and
ethnical identity.

At the same time, the responsible institutions must legally resolve issues in relation to
receiving of aid, including financial, from abroad, aimed for those non-governmental
organizations, representing interests of minorities.

Society integration policy shall cover not only national level, but it should also enhance
integration of the society of Latvia in a more extensive space of European values and


-----

culture, strengthening European identity and understanding of Latvia as an European
country.

Significant factor for successful integration of society is reducing of unwanted differences
between Riga and regions of the country. The state must provide regional support in
relation to their socio-political and cultural development.

**Strengthening of civic consciousness and values, such as belonging to Europe, in**
**the society, especially in school children and youth**

Future development of the country depends on its youth, thus, special attention shall be
paid to educational policy and environment where young people obtain their knowledge
and consciousness of their state. According to Latvia’s interests, educational system shall
be established to encourage formation of the feeling of belonging and loyalty to the Latvian
state and European cultural space.

Ties between school children and the state shall be strengthened purposefully, encouraging
cooperation between educational establishments and governmental institutions. To
strengthen ties of school children and Europe, learning of European Union languages from
the 1[st] grade at school shall be encouraged and this knowledge shall be used for arranging
of cooperation in the area of languages between schools in Latvian and European schools.

**Formation of common and accessible informative space**

An essential element for effective functioning of every democratic state and society is an
informative space, which allows maintenance of feedback between the state and its
citizens. It is essential to maintain pluralism of mass media and diversity of informative
environment, at the same time, allowing no unwanted splitting of informative space by
language, ethnic or other principles.

The state shall provide preventing of challenges so as the national informative space is
accessible for possibly larger part of the society of Latvia, who, when consuming and using
it daily, can obtain required information.

Common informative space available to all citizens shall be formed in Latvia, ensuring
complete access to alternative information resources, especially those in European Member
States.

Based on aims stated in the Society integration policy, appearing of popular and
competitive mass media products in the most common minority languages in Latvia shall
be enhanced, whose content would be aimed to popularization of Latvian and European
values. Furthermore, such informative space policy shall be used, so as mass media would
enhance use of official language among the society.

To ensure opportunity to use information resources of western countries, learning of
foreign languages in different age groups shall be encouraged, especially, among youth.
Knowledge of foreign languages will facilitate to population opportunity to obtain
information from the European mass media.

**3.4. Prevention of threats to economic interests**

Significant factor enhancing national security is economic safety and ability to implement
economic policy according to interests of the state. Significant impact to the economic
situation in the country is made by the policy implemented by state institutions and actions
by some economic subjects.

As a result of sharp, though, unbalanced development of economy in Latvia, effect of
global financial and economic crisis was more negative in Latvian economy than in other
countries. As a result of crisis and other factors, economic activity in the country
experienced sharp decrease and demand for goods and services produced in Latvia


-----

decreased both abroad and inside the country. Level of unemployment sharply increased,
causing growth of the level of emigration abroad.

Significant risk is instability of economic environment and lack of financial resources in
Latvian companies, which reduces scale of operation and encourages sales of companies,
having strategic significance to the state, to foreign businessmen for the price below their
long-term market value.

In order to enhance long-term economic sovereignty of the state, it is within the strategic
interests of Latvia to establish stable and predictable economic environment, to promote
business development, production of goods at high demand in foreign markets and the use
of the geographical condition of the state to increase budget revenue and to ensure rise in
employment level.

Priorities of Latvia for ensuring economic security:

**Establishing of stable and predictable economic environment**

Latvian state institutions shall enhance balanced state economy development and
implement well-considered fiscal policy. Furthermore, they must ensure involvement of
those parties concerned in the processes of making decision. In the state administration,
prevention of corruption risks shall be continued, implementing effective internal control
measures and ensuring explicit decision making mechanisms, as well as creating
transparent and open public procurement system, improving mechanism of administrative
responsibility in relation to offences in area of procurement and strengthening inevitability
of punishment. Law enforcement institutions must continue systematic operation in
corruption combating, paying particular attention to reducing of the higher corruption level
and “stealing of the state”. Monitoring of financial sector must be enhanced to ensure
stability of credit institutions. The state financial policy shall remain oriented to invention
of Euro in the future.

**Enhancement of sustainable economic growth**

Further strategic development of Latvian economy requires continuation of development of
innovation processes, which have positive effect both on competitiveness of the state and
on more sharp movement towards the economic model based on the knowledge with
predominant high productivity level, qualified labour force, as well as development and
export of technologies and services with high added value. Representation of the state
economic interests abroad shall also be considered significant. In order to ensure
preconditions for production of goods and rendering of services with high added value,
priority shall be given to the support for science and research, well-considered use of
structural funds, development of institutional system of innovations for capacity growth,
ensuring high quality education and training of labour force.

Latvia shall encourage economic cooperation, support attraction of investments, as well as
export to those states, which, to increase their political influence, use economic policy
measures in their hands.

**Provision of supply of energy resources**

Latvia must ensure conditions for stable and timely supplies of required energy resources,
as well as support invention of technologies for useful utilization of energy resources. The
state shall enhance use of initial energy resources in economy. Diversification of most
significant supply sources, routes and necessary infrastructure for energy resources shall
be ensured, based on economic profitability. Latvia must support use of local renewable
energy resources in the Latvian power industry, as well as development of technologies
using them.

As a significant priority, ensuring of long-term capacity of electric power base and
increasing of interconnection capacity with neighbouring states shall be endured.


-----

Integration of Baltic States, including Latvia, into the structure of European power industry
must be enhanced.

**3.5. Prevention of threats caused by extremist and radically oriented**
**organizations**

There are several organizations operating in Latvia, whose members’ views and public
activities demonstrate support for radical ideologies. Although, operation of such
organizations is established, number of their members is low and they have no continuous
support in society, furthermore, they have limited financial and organizational resources.
Their activities usually are limited to attempts to expand their operation, consolidate with
other marginal groups of society and promote their ideas.

The most significant threat shall be considered attempts by the left oriented radical
organizations to consolidate and legalize their operation as political parties, expanding
their international operation with ideologically similar organizations abroad.

The strategic goal of Latvia is to limit extremism in all its forms of expression, especially
turning against political extremism and extreme forms of radicalism of the society, to take
preventive and educational measures in order to reduce risks that may be caused by
radically oriented organizations to public order and security.

Priorities of Latvia in prevention of terrorism threats:

**International cooperation**

Efficient international collaboration must be implemented between security institutions of
the state of Latvia and foreign intelligence services and law enforcement bodies to ensure
timely uncovering of Latvian and foreign extremist and radically oriented organizations and
mutual connections of their leaders, experience exchange and plans to participate in
national or international scale protest campaigns.

**Inter-institutional collaboration and information exchange**

Mutual collaboration of security institutions and law enforcement bodies of the state of
Latvia must be developed in terms of the prevention of extremism manifestation, as well
as active collaboration with non-governmental organisations, which specialise in the field
of human rights and represent definite minority groups of the society, must be ensured.
Preventative measures, including the required changes within normative acts, must be
taken to eliminate the attempts of extremist and radically oriented organizations to
legalize their activity.

**Education of society**

The society must be educated about the goals of the activity of extremist and radically
oriented organizations, the implemented activity, the caused consequences, as well as
their long-term impact on social and economic, as well as political development of the
society and state. Increasing support to extremist and radically oriented organizations
from various groups of the society may promote their involvement in political processes
that may leave a negative impact on the public order and security, stability of domestic
policy in general, as well as the international image of the state.

It must be achieved that the possibilities of these organizations to gain popularity and
support required for developing their activity within broader society are reduced,

**3.6. Prevention of international terrorism threats**

The level of terrorism threats in Latvia has remained low – at the moment no persons,
their groups or organisations have been encountered in Latvia that would plan to use


-----

terroristic methods for achieving their ideological goals. So far no organisations or persons
that would carry out direct radicalization of a public group or gather persons for
involvement in terroristic activities have been discovered in Latvia.

However, Latvia cannot be separated from regularities taking place in Europe where
overall trend of rise Islamic terrorism threats may be observed. Among extremists Latvia is
identified with European countries, processes taking place therein and the security and
defence policies implemented by these countries. NAF units involved in international
operations and civilian experts in Afghanistan are exposed to the highest threat of
terrorism at the moment. Potential terrorism risks may be caused for Latvia also by selfradicalized individuals.

International terrorism development trends and the analysis of terror acts taking places in
NATO and EU member states show that the highest probability of terrorism threats still
remain against transport infrastructure objects (especially civil aviation and railway system
objects), as well as mass gathering places of people. Meanwhile the probability of a
terrorist act by using chemical, biological or radioactive substances may be characterised
as very minimal.

The provision of its contribution in the battle against international terrorism to eliminate
rise in terrorism threats in NATO and EU member states, as well as to ensure timely
development of a modern national anti-terrorism system that would be capable of
efficiently preventing and overcoming terrorism threats in case of rapid increase of the
probability thereof is within the strategic interests of Latvia.

Priorities of Latvia in prevention of terrorism threats:

**Participation in international terrorism combating operations**

In the area of prevention of the international terrorism threats, Latvia must rely upon the
vision that interests of the state national security is to enhance combating of terrorism in
regions where international terrorism organizations are based and terrorist training and
planning of terrorism acts against NATO and EU Member States occurs. Thus, Latvia in line
with its ability and in cooperation with forces of other NATO and EU Member States shall
participate in international peace-maintaining missions to support ability of other countries
to control security situation in their territory, at the same time, preventing idea of
extremism and expansion of terrorism trends outside traditional risk regions in Asia and
Northern Africa.

**International collaboration**

State security institutions and other institutions involved into anti-terrorism measures
must develop cooperation with NATO, EU and anti-terrorism institutions of other
international organizations. Latvia must actively participate in the planning and
implementation of the European common anti-terrorism policy, enhancing opportunity to
prevent threats of terrorism to EU states and their people. State security institutions shall
develop cooperation with special services in the area of anti-terrorism in other states,
participating in analyses of threats and development of anti-terrorism operations.

**Collaboration between state, municipal and legal institutions in the area of anti-**
**terrorism**

During the recent decade, terrorism has become a threat, preventing of and combating
against which is not a task of only state security institutions. Development of the national
security system shall be based upon purposeful cooperation between state and municipal
institutions, as well as legal persons, enhancing opportunities to minimize possibility of
threats of terrorism in the territory of Latvia. It is necessary to continue developing
capacity of the Security Police as the main institution coordinating anti-terrorism measures
in Latvia, enhancing development of high quality threat analyses and assessment,
development of anti-terrorism preventive and reaction plans for various threat situations,
as well as organizing anti-terrorism training on a regular basis.


-----

**Security of terrorism risk objects**

State security institutions must continue establishing objects (objects of critical
infrastructure, mass gathering objects, etc.), which could eventually become targets for
terrorist attacks. It is necessary to ensure security measure plan for these objects and
coordination of high quality development of procedures and control of efficiency of their
implementation. Significant precondition for effective anti-terrorism security level in
objects shall become formation of understanding on urgency of terrorism threats and
measures to be taken to reduce such threats in proprietors/legal holders of these objects
and persons working in these objects.

**3.7. Prevention of information technology threats**

One of the most topical factors of threats to national security shall be considered
information technology threats or actions against national security interests performed in
the electronic information space. In conditions when the state administration, society and
economy depend on information technology providers and supported services, their illegal
use, damage, benumbing or destroying may cause threats to national and social security,
public order, as well as can affect national economy. By means of information
technologies, one can suspend or terminate operation of the state information systems and
electronic communication network, hinder mechanism of the state’s political, economic and
military decision making, misinform the society, as well as cause technogenic accidents.

Currently threats to the electronic information space shall be considered average, and it
has no significant effect to the national security, however, it is expected that in the nearest
future, number of electronic attacks will increase and methods, by which such attacks are
made, will expend. Although, this threat traditionally is directly related to political, military
or economic processes in the state, we shall not exclude possibility that in several cases, in
electronic information space, some unexpected “attacks” can be made, aiming to benumb
operation of specific information technologies.

National interests of the state in the area of security in information technologies shall be to
ensure security of information technologies, as well as to enhance existing mechanisms
and reduce risks caused by the so called human factor in the area of use of information
technologies.

Priorities of Latvia for prevention of threats in electronic information space:

**Enhancement of legal regulation**

It is necessary to enhance legal regulation, establishing framework of IT critical
infrastructure protection, forming and effective institutions for prevention of IT incidents,
establishing actions in case of any threats by information technologies, establishing
minimum security requirements for governmental and municipal information technologies,
as well as specifying responsibility and its scale in relation to crimes in electronic
information space and against information technologies.

**Enhancement of inter-institutional and international collaboration**

It is necessary to continue cooperation of responsible public authorities both at the
strategic and operational level, i.e. in prevention of electronic attacks and elimination of
their consequences. Furthermore, it is necessary to improve cooperation between public
authorities, municipalities and legal entities in private rights, in order to ensure continuous
exchange of information and increase of mutual understanding and reliability.

Considering specifics of threats by information technologies, enhancement of international
cooperation, in particular, in relation to cooperation with Lithuania and Estonia, as well as
the NATO Cyber Protection Education Perfection Centre in Tallinn, shall be required, thus,
not only improving ability of Latvia to react to threats by information technologies, but also
contributing to prevention of IT threats in other states.


-----

**Enhancement of the procedure of identification of and responding to threats**

In order to effectively respond to any information technology threats, it is necessary to
enhance ability to timely recognize and identify both internal and external threats, as well
as to perform analysis of such threats. Thus, continuous cooperation between responsible
public authorities, participation in training and organizing of such training in Latvia shall be
of high importance.

**Enhancement of knowledge in users of information technologies**

Uneducated or irresponsible user of information technologies aggravates threats by
information technologies, thus, significant priority shall be enhancement of knowledge and
responsibility of users of information technologies in the area of security. Thus, it is
necessary to continue with ongoing activities and organize new activities, aimed at
education of users of information technologies. Priority shall be set upon education of
employees of public authorities.

Furthermore, it is required to improve higher education system, enhancing development of
studies programmes in relation to issues of security of information technologies, thus,
adding to scientific potential in enhancement of security of information technologies.
