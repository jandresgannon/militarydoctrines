#### 1. Introduction

###### The Norwegian Long-Term Defence Plan outlines the continuous development of the Norwegian Defence Sector with respect to organisation, infrastructure (garrisons and bases), personnel (numbers, composition and qualifications) and materiel (existing equipment and new acquisitions). The Government outlines a direction towards a more capable and sustainable defence force better able to face future challenges and the changing security environment. The Ministry of Defence (MoD) maintains the National Investment plan for the defence sector through continuous planning in different timeframes from four to twenty years ahead. The National Investment Plan itself is evaluated and updated several times per annum based on changing requirements, resources and progress within on-going acquisitions. The Investment Plan outlines the basis for all major procurement activities in the short- term (4 years) and the medium-term (8 years) perspectives. MoD issues The Investment Plan at least once a year. 

 The Government acknowledges the defence industries contribution to the Armed Forces’ capabilities. The defence industry provides the Armed Forces with support from the provision and maintenance of military equipment through delivery of a wide range of support services.

 A central feature in the annual updating of the Investment Plan is the preparation and publication of an unclassified overview of long-term requirements and objectives. This publication does not examine each planned project in detail but establishes a platform for in-depth discussions between the Defence Sector and industry. Hence, industry can get an early overview of potential future investments. The intent of giving this insight to commercial entities is to present the possibility for single or cooperative initiatives that can support the needs of both the Defence Sector and the Industry. Having a proven and highly skilled industry is also fundamental for being able to compete in the international defence market, a market that in many ways remains closed. Infrastructure projects are only described in the text through the document. Details in the tables will be included in a later edition.

 The investment projects are subject to decisions and approval by the MoD and the Parliament. 

 The projects listed in this publication have not yet been approved for implementation, as they have status as planned projects. It is necessary to emphasise that any project not yet formally approved may subsequently be terminated or changed without any further explanation or liability. 

 Details related to a small number of classified and sensitive projects are being withheld.

###### Projects that are approved will not be addressed in this publication, but are listed in the charts presented in chapter 4. Information about major projects in this category can be found, among other places, on the home page of the Norwegian Defence Materiel Agency (NDMA).

 This publication is only available as an electronic document on the Defence Sector’s area of the website http://www.regjeringen.no, and will not be published in paper format. An English version is published due to the statutory objectives and principles of procurement regulations, regarding competition and equal treatment.

#### 2. National Defence Industry Strategy.

###### An increasingly complex security environment with rapid technological advancements creates challenges that require actions to protect our national security and prosperity. The Norwegian defence industry is strategically important for Norway and is vital for our national security interests. In order to provide operational support and capabilities for the Norwegian Armed Forces, we need a viable and predictable defence industry. The Norwegian defence industry is one of world’s leading producers of niche products, and one of the core elements of the new industrial strategy is to improve the Norwegian defence industry to become even more competitive globally.

 In order to have a competitive industry the National Defence Industry Strategy has prioritized eight technological areas, which provides the industry with a clear direction for future developments and national needs. The strategy highlights the importance of innovation, technology, national and international cooperation, and addresses the most important elements to maintain a future-proof Norwegian defence industry. 

 The eight prioritized technological areas are as following:

 1. Command and control systems, information, decision support and combat
 systems 
 2. Systems integration 3. Autonomous systems and artificial intelligence  4. Missile technology 5. Underwater technology 6. Ammunitions, propulsion technologies and explosives  7. Materiel technology developed for military use 8. Life cycle support for military land, air and sea systems

 Additionally, the Government will seek to take advantage of emerging disruptive technologies nationally and as part of international cooperation. 

 The strategy puts forward a holistic approach on how incentives are included in the acquisition process of defence equipment. The incentives are adjusted to each phase of the life cycle, from research and development to procurement and sustainment.

###### The strong cooperation between the defence sector, defence industry and academia has been essential in achieving innovation and exploitation of new technology. The defence sector must cooperate with relevant industry from other sectors that are in lead of their respective technological areas. Cooperating with leading actors in academia and the civilian industry and engagement in collaborative development brings new technology that will help modernize the Norwegian Armed Forces.

 The Ministry of Defence will facilitate and strengthen international cooperation to ensure the Armed Forces' access to critical capacities and enhance global market access for the Norwegian industry. Bilateral and international cooperation is a crucial measure for success. The strategy further highlights the need to develop and reinforce the cooperation with small- and medium size businesses, which provide relevant technology, services and products. A stronger international procurement and industrial cooperation strengthens Norway’s contribution to support national and international ability to deliver technology, systems and expertise in demand. 

 Norway has adopted the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals. The defence sector is also committed to implement goals relevant for the defence sector. Promotion of transparency, accountability, integrity and fighting corruption are strongly emphasised. Several mitigating actions are successfully across the social, economic and environmental pillars of sustainable development.

#### 3. Investments in the Norwegian Defence Sector

###### The Norwegian Defence Sector consists of the Norwegian Ministry of Defence (MoD) and its subordinate bodies; the Norwegian Armed Forces, the Norwegian Defence Estates Agency, the Norwegian Defence Materiel Agency and the Norwegian Defence Research Establishment. All new investment projects within the Defence Sector are approved by the MoD, and subordinate bodies execute the planning and procurements according to existing procedures. An important tool is the PRINSIX project model that describes phases, decision points and roles/responsibilities. This project model ensures a uniform execution of procurements. The MoD has established several investment domains to oversee and provide guidance through all the phases of procurements. Projects are typically conceived in two ways. One is the top-down approach, which largely deals with the major weapon systems resulting from strategic planning processes. The second way is the bottom-up approach, which deals with smaller requirements typically initiated by the services and users. At an early stage, the proposal is known as a Project Idea (PI), which is assessed by the portfolio manager, who presents recommendations to the investment committee, led by the Chief of Defence (CHOD). If the investment committee finds the PI to have merit, it is subsequently recommended to the MoD for approval and to be part of the Investment Plan. This is the first formal decision point. In a conceptual study, alternative concepts are assessed with respect to how capability requirements can be resolved in conceptually different ways. The study also assesses different procurement solutions, and recommends one of these for further development. The

###### outcome of a conceptual study is submitted in a document referred to as a Conceptual Solution. This document forms the basis for the Central Guidance document (CGD) which further develops the recommended solution from the conceptual study. Based on the CGD a decision will be made at the end of this phase whether to move on with the project or not. External quality control of the conceptual study is done in accordance with guidelines from the Royal Norwegian Ministry of Finance for projects exceeding 1000 million NOK. 

 Once the Conceptual Solution is approved, the project moves into the next phase which is the detailed planning process leading up to the approval of the acquisition of the materiel in question. During this phase, the project is referred to as a Planned Project. Important outcomes of this planning phase are scope, procurement strategy, timelines and contractual provisions. 

 Major materiel acquisitions with a scope exceeding 500 million NOK require approval from the Parliament. For digital projects the limit is 300 million NOK, and for infrastructure projects 200 million NOK. Projects with a lower scope are approved by the MoD.

###### Figure 2- Acquisitions (% share) broken down by main category.

 According to the Long-Term Plan for the Armed Forces, large investments in modern materiel are planned for the Army. Various capabilities have been evaluated, each contributing to the necessary capacity of the land forces, and securing that available funds are used to provide the best possible operational capability. As with other acquisitions of key capabilities for the Armed Forces, the acquisitions of main systems for the Army will be time-consuming. The most important initiatives for the Army are to establish Finnmark Land Defence with adequate capabilities, strengthen the brigade system with further mechanization, and establish a satisfactory combat air defence.

 A new 155 mm artillery system has been procured, while new artillery hunting radars are being procured. Acquisition of a new, modern tank capacity with associated infrastructure will start at the end of the short-term period. In order to maintain the tank capacity until new tanks are delivered from 2025, the service life of the existing Leopard 2 A4 will be extended. Additionally, it is planned to introduce a long-range precision fire system for the Army at the end of the period.

 A number of support vehicles based on the Leopard and the M113 platforms are renewed to support the mechanized structure. Furthermore, command and control systems for the Army will be upgraded continuously throughout the period. All-terrain vehicles and trucks will be replaced, when existing vehicles reaches the end of their service life. Overall, this means that the main materiel in the Army has been significantly modernized or is in the process of being modernized. The strengthening

###### of the Army in Finnmark is supported by the acquisition of Man-Portable Air-Defence System and combat engineer resources.

 Modern equipment for the individual soldier, such as personal clothing and equipment, weapons, personal protection, optics and night capacity equipment will increase the ability to survive and conduct effective operations. Norwegian soldiers have modern and state-of-the-art equipment, and this will be maintained throughout the period with the supply of new equipment with associated necessary infrastructure such as barracks, offices, medical services, garrison security and garages.

 Special Forces capabilities will be upgraded throughout the period. For further details, contact Oeistein Edvardsen, Defence Staff: oaedvardsen@mil.no., tel: +47 2309 6340.

##### 4.3  Maritime Domain

###### Figure 3- Acquisitions (% share) broken down by main category.

 The main procurement for the naval forces will be the acquisition of new submarines including pier-, maintenance and test facilities. The first submarine is planned to be delivered in 2029, and the last one in 2035. In order to sustain the submarine capability, the existing Ula-class is subject to modernization in order to stay relevant in its remaining lifetime.

 Coast guard vessels Svalbard and Harstad will receive necessary modernization and upgrades in order to extend remaining service time. The inshore vessels of the coastguard (Nornen-class) will be upgraded in the middle of the period. 

 Towards the end of the medium-term period, the Fridtjof Nansen-class frigates will undergo a technical update to ensure continuation of the vessels' operational capability. This work will include a large number of systems on-board. Critical safety updates may be initiated earlier.

 A sufficient number of the Skjold-class corvettes will be continued until 2030, and will undergo upgrades in the first part of the period.

 A future maritime mine countermeasure capability will be established in the period, consisting of autonomous counter measure systems. As a part of this project, two motherships for these systems will be procured or leased. This system will replace

###### existing minesweepers and -hunter vessels, which also will undergo a continuation programme to ensure a relevant capability until the new system is fully operational.

 The Naval Strike Missile is an anti-ship missile produced by Kongsberg Defence & Aerospace, and represents the Navy's main weapon against surface vessels. A new, upgraded NSM missile (Future NSM) is being developed in cooperation with Germany, which will be available from 2035.

 The first project in a series of four related to upgrades and development of the Coastal Ranger capability will start early in the period. Activities will continue throughout the period. 

 Special Forces capabilities will be upgraded throughout the period. For further details, contact Oeistein Edvardsen, Defence Staff: oaedvardsen@mil.no, tel: +47 2309 6340.

 Investments in necessary infrastructure to support vessels, maritime helicopters and personnel such as barracks, offices, port- and maintenance facilities will be carried out during the period. 

 Replacement capability for coastguard and support vessels is in the early stages of an analysis process. A replacement with a standardized class of vessels is likely when current vessels become obsolete.

 A new naval surface structure will be analysed in due time before the plans for decommissioning the Skjold-class corvettes and Nansen-class frigates around 2030 are being executed.

##### 4.4 Air Domain

###### Figure 4- Acquisitions (% share) broken down by main category.

 The new Long-Term Defence Plan introduces measures to ensure the Norwegian Armed Forces will continue to strengthen their efforts in the air domain. The introduction of new weapon systems and the upgrade of existing systems will enhance the combat power in the long term. 

 The procurement of new aircraft systems including weapons and additional equipment will have priority for the Air Force during the years leading up to 2025. Extensive infrastructure is being established at Oerland and Evenes air bases, including logistic facilities, hangars, base defence and upgrade of operational structures. Upgrades of the F-35 aircraft will begin at the end of the period and beyond. P-8 Poseidon maritime patrol aircraft with associated logistics and maintenance facilities as well as infrastructure will replace the fleet of P-3 Orion. C- 130J will be upgraded in the period. The Bell 412 transport helicopters are due to be replaced by a new helicopter capability better suited for the Special Forces, and to increase the transport capability for the Army.

 The Air Force and the Army are expanding their air defence capability. To improve air defence capability, NASAMS will be be upgraded with modern sensors as well as integrated with a Long-Range Air Surveillance Sensor System. There are also plans for replacing the existing missile (AMRAAM AIM-120B) with a new medium-range missile with extended range as well as introduction of a complementary capacity with shorter range. Associated infrastructure will be upgraded and renewed. The implementation of the Army mobile air defence continues, and will be expanded.

##### 4.5 Cyber Domain

###### Figure 5- Acquisitions (% share) broken down by main category.

 The Norwegian Armed Forces are dependent on the cyber domain to conduct operations and assigned tasks by possessing modern and updated ICT-solutions. Robust ICT-solutions, which effectively connects effectors, sensors and decision makers, is a decisive capability to provide for an effective military force with good operational ability. Modern and resilient ICT solutions further enable the Armed Forces to access a significant unrealised potential accessible in the Armed Forces’ force structure. The Armed Forces operational capabilities are also dependent on efficient management, logistics and force production.

 Streamlining and improvement of these elements are crucial and will be achieved by increased digitalisation, innovation efforts and utilisation of new and emerging technologies. To make this possible, the defence sector needs modern and flexible ICT solutions that facilitate digitalisation according to The Defence Sector ICT Strategy and the Armed Forces’ digitalisation strategy. 

 The investments within the cyber domain will primarily focus on measures that will contribute in strengthening the Armed Forces ICT infrastructure. Current plans incorporate significant investments in the timeframe 2022 – 2029 for these purposes. These investments will modernise and develop new ICT solutions in areas such as combat-near ICT, military application of cloud services, compounded ICT,

###### applications, communications infrastructure (including communications satellites), geographical services, information security and other ICT.

 The main investment effort within the cyber domain is conducted within the two programmes Mime (combat-near ICT) and MAST (Military application of cloud services). These programmes shall deliver operational effect through investment, business, and innovation measures coordinated and managed as a whole. 

 Program Mime will provide solutions for combat-near ICT towards 2030, while program MAST will modernise the Armed Forces’ secure ICT platforms with integrated services towards 2028. The Armed Forces have delivered a conceptual study for the Armed Forces’ secure ICT platforms and integrated services, which describes guidelines for the modernisation of a large portion of the Armed Forces’ ICT-systems. 

 Within the area of compounded ICT, we will see a significant effort on providing ICT for the Special Forces. Significant funding will also be used on continuing the efforts on Joint Intelligence, Surveillance and Reconnaissance (JISR) capabilities and solutions for secure information exchange. The ICT infrastructure on several existing bases will be further developed and modernised. 

 Within the area of communication infrastructure, significant investments are planned in this period, regarding both the stationary infrastructure and static networks, in the use of satellites and diverse radio transmitters.

 A resilient, high capacity communications infrastructure with the ability to resist and withstand relevant threats is a prerequisite for other ICT systems and is thus highly prioritized. In addition, the Armed Forces will be supplied with a new space segment for wide band infrastructure satellite communications in the Northern area, early in the timeframe.

 Further, significant investments will be made in the other areas within the cyber domain: applications, geographical services, information security and assurance as well as other ICT.
