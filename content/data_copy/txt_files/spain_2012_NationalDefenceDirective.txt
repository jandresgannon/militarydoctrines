# PRESIDENCY OF THE GOVERNMENT

 NATIONAL DEFENCE DIRECTIVE 2012

 FOR A NECESSARY AND RESPONSIBLE DEFENCE

 MADRID

 JULY, 2012


-----

**1.‐ INTRODUCTION**

The publication of a new National Defence Directive (NDD) is justified by the beginning of a new
term, by ongoing changes in international spheres and especially in our immediate context, and
also by the entry into force of the Treaty of Lisbon and the ratification of the new NATO
Strategic Concept. In addition to these, the economic crisis acts as a threat to security, requiring
that certain decisions be made and full caution be applied in maintaining the capabilities
required for defence.

The Government of the nation has the inalienable, non‐transferable and unrenounceable
responsibility and obligation to guarantee the safety of all Spanish citizens. The defence policy
and the capacity of the Armed Forces to prevent, deter and respond to actions that threaten
this safety constitute the backbone of our institutional defence system, which contributes in a
singular manner to national security.

In this context, Spain must maintain two aspects of a responsible defence: the first, involves an
instrument prepared and adapted to respond to the real and potential threats, risks and
challenges that may arise; the second, involves the capacity for efficient action with the lowest
possible cost to society, at a time when austerity is a national imperative.

Spain is also a member of multinational security and defence organisations, involving good and
trustworthy allies that should be relied upon. Spain must act in loyalty and solidarity with
collective security efforts. Finally, we must not ignore the fact that the best contribution our
nation can offer to international stability is its own strength in a world full of uncertainty, where
the military instrument available to the government is critically essential.

It is also important to highlight the need for profound reflection regarding the manner in which
Spain will face the risks and threats it will encounter in the first half of the 21[st] century.

This reflection will only be successful if it is developed in the context of broad participation and
with a mid‐ to long‐term focus. It must clearly demonstrate the will to prevail over non‐shared
threats and establish Spain as an ally that is both loyal and frank with its EU and NATO partners.
Finally, it must uphold the objective of achieving credibility within Spain’s circle of allies and
when confronting those who could pose a threat.

**2.‐ EVOLUTION OF THE STRATEGIC PANORAMA AND ITS REPERCUSSIONS FOR SPAIN**

The conflicts in the first decade of the 21[st] century seem to define a scenario of hybrid threats
that combine conventional conflict and asymmetrical confrontation, with the latter showing a
tendency towards growth and threatening to extend itself where possible to spaces outside the
control of territorially sovereign states.

The Atlantic Alliance remains the most appropriate link for security and collective defence for
Spain. The approval of a new Strategic Concept in 2010 did not definitively end reflection on the
direction and strategic challenges faced by the Alliance. Such reflection must continue until it
arrives at solid conclusions that positively affect the cohesion of future decisions by the
Alliance.

Spain should be prepared to face the risks of a world defined by inter‐connection, quality and
speed in the flow of information, remote management of transactions, freedom of movement
and commercial exchanges. While all of these offer such evident benefits for society, they must
not provide a scenario in which terrorist groups have the advantage and organized crime
attains the capacity to seriously harm social peace, citizen security, political stability and
general prosperity.

Cyber attacks, the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction, human trafficking, piracy, the
spread of armed and unarmed extremist movements and groups and the breakdown of air and
space security are very real possibilities in the current situation. These global threats can only
be faced by a coalition of forces, which in our case is based on NATO and the EU. It will also
require the support of other countries and groups of countries that express a direct and similar
interest in controlling these phenomena.

The United States continues to lead the fight against global risks and threats, particularly those
arising from non‐state organizations. It has also sustained the project of extending democratic
ideals. However, the evolution of its strategic analysis is as evident as it has been inevitable and
must be recognised. The new global balance involves the rise of the Indo‐Pacific basin countries
as global actors.

These changes have consequences for NATO, which should make efforts to empower its role
through the new Strategic Concept; and for the EU, which should strengthen its capacities and
streamline decision‐making processes. EU and NATO Members, including Spain, must arrive at
an appropriate formula for reinforcing external projection through the Alliance and within the
framework of the Common Security and Defence Policy. Limiting ourselves to the security of
our own territory is not an option.

The position that Spain occupies also carries with it the responsibility of watching over the
consolidation of a secure environment, particularly in the Mediterranean. Numerous countries
along its South coast have begun important processes of political change that require our
attention, collaboration and cooperation in shaping new democratic structures and moderate
public opinion. Moreover, it cannot be forgotten that Spain’s security and full stability in the
Mediterranean will only be achieved if our immediate surroundings, the Middle East and the
Sahel, are moving in the right direction and if there is control of illicit trafficking originating
from Ibero‐America and the Gulf of Guinea. These require our presence in the Atlantic and
affect the development of policies with countries on both shores.

Thus, vigilance, prevention and action cannot be neglected in the control of endemic problems
projected from sub‐Saharan Africa towards North Africa, which ultimately affect Spain directly.
Cases of piracy at sea in the Gulf of Guinea are cause for concern. Piracy also affects the Eastern
coast of Africa and Spain continues to combat this phenomenon, along with other EU and NATO
partners.

The Ibero‐American continent enjoys peace among its States but faces other especially serious
threats such as drug trafficking and terrorism. In some cases, these even threaten the very
existence of a State. The most negative effects tend to extend beyond their borders and into
Spain or even directly threaten our citizens and companies on that continent. Spain must take
advantage of every opportunity to show solidarity and support for the Ibero‐American republics
suffering from these problems.

The conditions of our security have been significantly altered in recent years. In consequence,
Spain must strive to guarantee the permanence of the values reflected in its Constitution, as
well as the geo‐strategic security of its citizens, companies and the raw materials that sustain
our way of life in the face of current threats.

**3.‐ OBJECTIVES OF THE DEFENCE POLICY**

The first contribution of Spain to international peace and security is to guarantee its own, with
strength and resolve, procuring the capabilities that ensure deterrence when faced with what
are known as ‘non‐shared threats’. Ultimately, for this to endure, it is important that citizens
have adequate information regarding the state of our defence and adopt a position that places
critical demands and obligations on their political representatives.

The array of risks and threats we face today goes beyond the traditional notion of defence. This
makes it both necessary and urgent to plan the transition to a National Security Strategy ‐as

other countries around us have been doing‐ that goes beyond the documentary stage to involve
practical measures developed by the joint effort of the pertinent departments, to empower a
fully effective defence policy and any other sectoral policies required. Specifically, this would
include an efficient intelligence capability and increased coordination between the various
State intelligence and information services within the framework of the mechanisms that exist
for these purposes.

In spite of current budgetary constraints, Spain must have capabilities that ensure deterrence
taking into account the singular risks with which we are confronted. It must also contribute as a
member to the efforts of other organizations with this same objective, particularly the EU and
NATO, and participate in developing the best approach to deal with the overarching challenges
of today and tomorrow. Spain must also comply with international law and UN resolutions.

Currently, Spanish security is defined by three main features: increased instability in our
immediate context, the pursuit of more solid trans‐Atlantic links and the negative impact of the
economic crisis on our defensive capabilities, accompanied by a weakening of the collective
umbrella. In response, the general lines of Spain’s defence policy in this legislative term will
involve:

‐Ensuring a strong Spain that can maintain the necessary international influence for
contributing to stability in our direct area of interest and preserving our national interests
throughout the world.

‐Developing full coherence and coordination of the instruments available to the various
departments in order to achieve the greatest effectiveness when confronting national security
threats.

‐Maintaining a sufficient and credible level of national deterrence in order to avoid
potential risk scenarios that might become threats in our geographical context, and a response
capability that guarantees the defence of our national territory, population and interests.

‐Carrying out the necessary changes in the Armed Forces to face growing strategic
challenges in a time marked by limited availability of resources.

‐ Emphasizing strategic communication to foster defence awareness in Spain, and
ultimately, a defence culture. The defence of Spain should be embraced by Spaniards as a
matter of unquestionable significance upon which our independence, sovereignty, territorial
integrity, peace, liberty, respect for our interests and prosperity depend. An effective defence
requires citizen participation, the only formula that gives continuity and depth to its policies.

**4.‐ GUIDELINES FOR THIS LEGISLATIVE TERM**

The commitments of National Defence involve deterrence of potential threats to national
sovereignty, independence, territorial integrity or the constitutional order, responding to
aggressions against these values and the ongoing protection of national interests. The Armed
Forces contribute to this defence in a singular and essential manner by providing the means for
protecting vital national interests when other instruments have proven ineffective.

Deterrence begins with national cohesion translated into a collective will and determination to
preserve the values of our society, the material means of generating prosperity and the
strength of the State. Therefore, social awareness of the importance of security and defence is
necessary in times of great uncertainty.

The following guidelines will be implemented in order to fulfil the general criteria already
defined:

**4.1‐ Rationalization of the structures involved in the different aspects of national security**
through:

a) contributing to the revision of the Spanish Security Strategy.

b) carrying out a Strategic Defence Review.

**4.2‐ Deterrence is the result of having capabilities and the determination to use them if**
necessary. The greatest guarantee for peace and security is none other than credibility.
Consequently:

a) Priority will be given to maintaining the capabilities of the Armed Forces and making them
available according to the imperatives of the new strategic situation, in order to:

‐maintain deterrence

‐defend the national territory

‐maintain maritime and airspace vigilance

‐project military capabilities to defend our national interests

‐support civil authorities in emergencies

b) Comprehensive management of cybersecurity will be facilitated through participation within
the framework of the principles established in the National Cybersecurity Strategy.

c) Coordination mechanisms will be fostered in the intelligence community in order to
maximize the outcome of the work performed by the various departments to serve our
strategic interests.

**4.3‐** Security and defence organizations, especially NATO, are essential in the context of
uncertainty generated by diverse and globalized threats, which make an isolated response by a
single actor unthinkable. Spain decidedly supports and promotes the ultimate aim of actions to
cover all our security needs under the defensive umbrella of the EU and NATO. Moreover, it will
participate in all initiatives aimed at strengthening the goals and unity of these organizations,
avoiding gaps in doctrine that might cast doubt on its will to prevail in these spheres. This will
involve:

a) active and responsible participation in NATO initiatives aligned with our national and
collective interests.

b) collaboration in the construction and progress of the Common Security and Defence Policy
and Permanent Structured Cooperation, contributing to greater coherence and effectiveness.

c)reinforcement of bilateral relations with actors that share interests and/or threats and can
offer stability to our context or improve Spain’s position in the sphere of strategic relations.

**4.4‐ The need for greater effectiveness of our Armed Forces and the limitations imposed by the**
current economic context make it necessary to re‐examine the current design of its structures.
The structures and procedures of the Armed Forces will be adapted to increase management
efficiency and better obtain or use resources, encouraging the alignment of financial resources
available for defence with the requirements of the strategic scenario and related needs of the
Armed Forces.

**4.5‐ Finally, the defence of Spain calls for enhancing our defence industry, which is ideally**
suited to meet the needs of our Armed Forces. At present, this industry is in need of assistance
to ensure its permanence and develop greater international presence, especially in penetrating
specific markets that require greater guarantees and involve State‐to‐State support.

**5.‐ FINAL PROVISIONS**

The Government will adopt the necessary provisions for developing this Directive, upon the
proposal of the Minister of Defence, by means of a Council of Ministers Agreement.
