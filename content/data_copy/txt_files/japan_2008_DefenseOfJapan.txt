On the Publication of Defense of Japan 2008

**Yoshimasa Hayashi**

Minister of Defense


Last year’s “Defense of Japan 2007” was our first white paper since the transition of the Defense Agency to the
Ministry of Defense. The white paper demonstrated the resolve of the Ministry to become an organization more
resilient to crisis and more capable of contributing to the international peace.

However, we cannot say that the roughly one year that has passed from that time to the publication of this white

paper has been a bright one for the Ministry of Defense and the Self-Defense Forces. During this period, there
occurred a wide range of problems as follows: problems related to thorough implementation of civilian control such
as the mistaken reporting of the amount of fuel replenished and the mistaken destruction of log books; problems
related to establishment of a strict information security system, such as an information leakage via the Internet
and leakage of a Special Defense Secret regarding the Aegis system; problems related to transparency of defense
procurement such as excessive billing by suppliers; and misconducts such as the arrest of a former Vice-Minister of
Defense on suspicion of bribery. These serious problems have deeply undermined the trust of the people, and I once
again offer my sincere apologies for such incidents.

Regarding the collision of the MSDF destroyer _Atago with the fishing boat_ _Seitoku Maru, which occurred_

on February 19, 2008, it is unacceptable that the SDF, whose mission is to protect the lives and property of the
people, caused such an incident. We deeply regret the occurrence of this accident. We intend to take all preventative
measures to ensure that we will never cause any similar incident again.

Based on this series of problems, discussions involving experts were conducted at the Council for Reforming

the Ministry of Defense which had been established within the Prime Minister’s Office, and a report was compiled
in July of this year.

This report thoroughly assessed and analyzed each of the problems and presented proposals based on the

reform principles of: 1) Thorough adherence to rules and regulations, 2) Establishment of professionalism, and 3)
Establishment of a management of works that prioritizes the execution of duty, with the aim of total optimization.

Moreover, the report states that organizational reform is also necessary in order to enable the Ministry of Defense

and the Self-Defense Forces to more steadily and effectively implement these three principles and present proposals
for specific reforms to enhance the command functions of the Prime Minister’s Office and the Ministry of Defense.


-----

The purpose of this reform is not restructuring of the Ministry of Defense itself, but to prevent the recurrence

of problems and accidents in the future as well as to try to build a system that enables the Ministry of Defense
and the Self-Defense Forces to respond more quickly and appropriately to a wide range of challenges such as
new threats and diverse situations including the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction and international
terrorism and the continued severe security environment surrounding Japan. We will proceed with further reviews
within the Ministry of Defense and steadily implement drastic reform of the Ministry.

Concerning protection of the independence and peace of Japan, it is the Ministry of Defense and the SDF alone

which provide the ultimate defense for the people of Japan. That is why I believe that it must be an organization
with strict discipline that can earn confidence from the people and must live up to the trust of the people. The
majority of SDF members solemnly devote themselves to engaging in international peace cooperation activities
in the Indian Ocean and other places in the world, as well as day-to-day missions in various regions throughout
Japan. This is why I believe that the Ministry of Defense and the SDF should be revitalized for the sake of the
people of Japan, for each and every SDF member, and in order to contribute to international peace and security.

We have written the “Defense of Japan 2008” in an accessible manner so as to promote an understanding

of the SDF’s activities among the people of Japan and other countries, while incorporating our resolve for the
reform of the Ministry of Defense. Furthermore, we have made efforts to convey the Ministry of Defense and
the Self-Defense Forces as they are through columns highlighting the voices of SDF members engaging in their
day-to-day duties.

It is my hope that this “Defense of Japan 2008” will be read by many people, and that we will obtain their

understanding of the Ministry of Defense and the Self-Defense Forces as well as their attention to and support
for the steady implementation of reform of the Ministry.

Chapter 1 Issues in the International Community

Various countries have formed an international alliance, and
the fight against terrorism is ongoing. However, terrorism
continues to occur at locations throughout the world. The
transfer and proliferation of weapons of mass destruction
is also cause for concern, and efforts regarding the North
Korean and Iranian nuclear issues are continuing.

Although the security situation in Iraq remains difficult,

the number of attacks and the number of terrorismrelated casualties have fallen, indicating some degree of
improvement. Discussion between the U.S. Military and the Iraq Military Officer concerning joint
operations [U.S. Department of Defense]

Chapter 2 National Defense Policies of Countries

The United States continues to promote the review of its military
stance and troop withdrawal. In view of the ongoing operations in
Iraq and Afghanistan, the United States is aiming to increase the
number of troops in the Army and Navy in order to expand military
capabilities and lighten the burden on divisions.

North Korea’s issues of weapons of mass destruction and

ballistic missiles pose serious threats to the peace and stability of
East Asia and the international community.

Against the backdrop of higher national defense spending,

China is working to further modernize its military, and there is
a need for vigilant analysis of such implications. Furthermore,
China’s breakdown of military spending remains unclear, therefore
improved transparency is desirable.

Russia continues to promote military reforms and increased

activity by the Russian military can be observed in the Far East

The Basics of Japan’s Defense Policy
As seen in photographs and Build-up of Defense Capability
# Part II

Chapter 1 The Basic Concepts of Japan’s Defense Policy

Peace, security, and independence cannot be ensured by
aspirations alone; they must be supported by a wide range
of policies, including diplomatic efforts, and cooperation with
allied nations along with self-defense capability.

(November 2007)

Prime Minister Fukuda gives instructions at a meeting of upper-level SDF officials


Under the Constitution, Japan’s basic philosophy is to
maintain an exclusively defense-oriented policy and not
become a military superpower that poses a threat to other
nations. In line with this basic philosophy, while continuing
to maintain the Japan-U.S. Security Arrangements, Japan
continues to ensure civilian control, uphold the three nonnuclear principles, and voluntarily maintain an appropriate
self-defense capability.

Defense Minister Hayashi giving instructions to officials (August 2008)


While the Ministry of Defense continues to uphold the
principles of defense policy, it is necessary at all times to
make efforts to play a suitable role in response to the changing
security environment.

The transition of the Defense Agency to the Ministry of

Defense in January 2007, as well as Japan’s participation in
international peace cooperation activities, are part of such
efforts to respond appropriately. Through these activities, the
Ministry of Defense is aiming to become an organization that is
more resilient to crisis and that can contribute to world peace.

Additionally, in recent years, there have been a number

of debates regarding the preparation of the “general law” for
international peace cooperation. The Ministry of Defense will An MSDF destroyer (left) providing fuel to a Pakistani destroyer (February 2008)

Chapter 2 The National Defense Program Guidelines and Build-up of Defense Capability

The National Defense Program Guidelines for FY 2005 and
Beyond (NDPG) enacted in December 2004 set forth two
security goals for Japan: to prevent and eliminate direct
threats to Japan and to improve the international security
environment so it will not pose a threat to Japan. In order
to achieve these goals, Japan will pursue a three-pronged
approach combining its own efforts with the cooperation of
allied nations and the international community.

In addition, in order to realize the new defense capability
stipulated in the NDPG, the Ministry of Defense has drawn
up a Mid-Term Defense Program for FY 2005-2009, and is
proceeding with efforts to improve its defense capability in
accordance with the program.

In FY 2008, taking into account the security environment

surrounding Japan, the Ministry of Defense is proceeding
with the modernization of defense capability, construction of
organizations to strengthen policy formation and information
security functions, and efforts for the peace and security of
the international community, while taking into account the
efficiency and priority of the build-up of defense capability.

Chapter 1 Operations of Self-Defense Forces for Defense of Japan and

Responses to Diverse Situations

The SDF makes efforts to be able to respond appropriately
for the defense of Japan as laid out in the NDPG, including
response to ballistic missile attacks, response to attacks by
guerilla or other special forces, response to air surveillance
or invasion of Japan’s airspace or incursion of armed vessels,
response to large-scale or extraordinary disasters, and
response to new situations or serious aggression.

The SDF is making various efforts to be able to respond

effectively to ballistic missiles and other situations in the event
of changes in the emergency response regarding operations,
including the addition of BMD capability to the MSDF Aegis
destroyer Kongo in December 2007 and the addition of Patriot
PAC-3 to the anti-aircraft troops stationed in the Tokyo area.

In addition, Japan is preparing legislation to ensure the

peace and security of the nation and the people in situations
in which Japan is under attack, and accordingly, the SDF is
building up operational structures, and working on an ongoing
basis to conduct rapid and effective self-defense operations in
a range of circumstances.

Chapter 2 Strengthening of the Japan-U.S. Security Arrangements

The Japan-U.S. Security Arrangements and the Japan-U.S.
Alliance, which forms the basis for the arrangements, are
of great significance for Japan’s defense and the peace and
stability of the region, as well as for the improvement of the
international security environment.

In recent years, both Japan and the United States, in

order to develop the alliance relationship even further, and
in response to changes in the security environment, have
conducted Japan-U.S. consultations regarding the future of
the Japan-U.S. Alliance, including the realignment of military
forces. At the 2+2 meeting in May 2006, the two countries
compiled a Roadmap for the Realignment of Forces.

Currently, based on the Law Concerning Special Measures on
Smooth Implementation of the Realignment of U.S. Forces
in Japan and Related SDF Forces, established in May 2007,
various measures are being steadily implemented in Japan,
including promotion of the realignment of forces.

Even as these efforts progress, Japan is making efforts

to maintain the effectiveness of the Japan-U.S. Security
Arrangements and improve trust through such means
as various Japan-U.S. consultations and preparation of
legislation, Japan-U.S. bilateral exercises, exchange in the
fields of equipment and technology, and various efforts related

Chapter 3 Improvement of the International Security Environment

The National Defense Program Guidelines aim at improving
international security so that threats will not come to Japan
along with the defense of Japan.

In Iraq, based on the Law Concerning Special Measures

on Humanitarian and Reconstruction Assistance in Iraq,
the SDF is currently contributing to the reconstruction and
stability of Iraq by providing support to the U.N. and allied
forces.

SDF continues its activities under the U.N. Disengagement
Observer Force (UNDOF) in the Golan Heights and the United
Nations Mission in Nepal (UNMIN).

Moreover, through deepening in terms of quality and

expanding in terms of quantity security dialogues and defense
exchanges, Japan is actively working toward the improvement
of the international security environment.

Furthermore, Japan is playing a leading and active role in

efforts for arms control, disarmament, and non-proliferation,
including the Proliferation Security Initiative (PSI).

Chapter 4 Citizens of Japan, the Ministry of Defense and the SDF

In order to perform their duties, it is essential for the SDF, which is at the core of Japan’s defense capability, to gain the understanding
and support of the people of Japan. Establishing the human and material infrastructure is also vital.

The base of defense capability is organizational and human infrastructure. Ultimately, the management of the organization

depends not on equipment or systems operations, but on the
ability of each SDF member.

The Ministry of Defense and the SDF have formed a variety

of organizations, centered around the GSDF, MSDF, and ASDF,
which comprise the true power of the organization. In order to
secure the human infrastructure, various necessary measures
are conducted at all stages; troop recruitment and enlistment,
and training exercises to retirement and reemployment.

In addition, information communications is the foundation

of the control and command infrastructure, from central
command and various levels of command through to the end
troops. The Ministry of Defense and SDF place importance on
strengthening this capability. In the area of technological research A matriculation pep rally held by a cooperating organization (Ehime Prefecture)

and development, while grasping operational needs, through
new research and development methods and introduction of
outstanding technologies resulting from industry-academicpublic sector cooperation, efforts are being made to incorporate
the latest science and technology.

The SDF operates in various forms in local communities with

the support and cooperation of the people of Japan. The SDF also
conducts cooperative activities to support the livelihood of the
people of Japan. These activities further solidify the mutual trust
between local communities, the people of Japan, and the SDF.

In addition, in order to fully uncover the functions of

defense facilities, with the understanding and cooperation of
local residents, it is necessary to maintain such facilities in
a condition for stable use at all times. The SDF consciously
endeavors to minimize the impact of establishment and SDF Ready Reserve personnel participate in disaster drills

###### Reform of the 
As seen in photographs Ministry of Defense
# Part IV

The unwavering trust of the people of Japan is the most
important factor in order to display defense capability and its
associated functions. However, in recent years, starting with
the arrest of a Vice-Minister suspected of accepting bribes, a
succession of incidents have come to light.

To address these incidents, the Ministry of Defense

and SDF must launch a comprehensive review of standard
operating procedures and construct full-fledged policies to
prevent a recurrence.

The 6th meeting of the Council for Reforming the Ministry of Defense, attended


by Prime Minister Fukuda (March 2008) [Cabinet Public Relations Office]

The Ministry of Defense and SDF resolve to make wholehearted
efforts for reform in order to restore the organizations’ ability
to support the peace and independence of Japan.

The Council for Reforming the Ministry of Defense, which

was established in the Prime Minister’s Office, has convened
meetings since November 2007, and in July 2008 a report
was released.

Taking into account analysis and investigation of the

misconducts, the report recommended the following three
basic principles for reform: (1) Thorough adherence to rules
and regulations, (2) Establishment of professionalism, and
(3) Establishment of a management of works that prioritizes
execution of duties, with the aim of total optimization.

The Ministry of Defense intends to make efforts towards Former Minister of Defense Ishiba gives New Year’s Address on the need to

concrete reform of the Ministry at the earliest possible date. reform the Ministry of Defense (January 2008)

In addition to the discussions of the Reform Council, the
Ministry of Defense has also held discussions at committees
established within the Ministry.

Preserving secrecy is an indispensable platform for the

national defense. Therefore, the Ministry is investigating and
implementing various measures to prevent the leakage of
information.

In addition, the Ministry of Defense has in the past

endeavored to acquire equipment in an appropriate and efficient
manner. Taking into account the efforts for the promotion of
Comprehensive Acquisition Reform in March 2008, going

###### Security Environment Surrounding Japan

### Overview

Overview

**1. General Situation**
In the international community today, with relations of mutual dependence between sovereign states growing ever
stronger, matters of security or the potential for instability emanating in one country have increasing potential to
transcend national borders and spread globally, impacting on other countries. As such, it is to the common benefit
of each country to secure global and regional peace, stability and prosperity through the promotion of a more
stable international security environment. Therefore it becomes more important for multinational cooperation in
the resolution of issues to the benefit of the international community as a whole.

The activities of non-state actors, including international terrorist organizations, present a serious threat. Acts

of terrorism are occurring in every region of the world.

The United States and other countries are continuing efforts in the fight against terrorism and have achieved

some success, but have confronted severe challenges presented in Iraq and Afghanistan – which are regarded
by the United States as front lines in this fight – and a crunch in the numbers of deployable troops to missions
overseas is becoming a significant issue. Consequently, the U.S. government has requested an increase in ground
and naval forces in order to expand military capacity and reduce the burden on deployed troops. Additionally,
given the recent resurgence of Taliban activities and other groups in Afghanistan, it has become necessary to
reinforce the International Security Assistance Force (ISAF), and the deployment and dispatch burden has been
brought to the attention of members of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO).

In addition to terrorism, the issue of proliferation of nuclear, biological, chemical and other weapons of mass

destruction (WMD) as well as ballistic missiles and their means of delivery, represent a continued and significant
threat to the international community. The issue of North Korea’s nuclear weapons and missiles remains unresolved,
which not only affects the security of Japan, but has become an issue of concern for the international community
from the perspective of the non-proliferation of WMD. Despite the issuance of numerous U.N. Security Council
Resolutions, Iran’s nuclear problem poses an additional concern to the international community.

These days, the relation between sovereign states, which cannot be overlooked in today’s security environment,

has some issues to watch.

While the U.S. and NATO-led fight against terrorism requires a persistent, long-term approach, the emergence

of China and India fueled by a robust economy and the resurgence of Russia, may lead these countries to pursue
more influence in the international community. Such developments should be regarded as major opportunities for
international collaboration and cooperation. Simultaneously, interest has risen in their policies, mutual interaction
and relations with other countries since any developments by these powers may have a significant impact on the
security environment.

It has also been pointed out in the international community that there is potential for competition for energy

resources among sovereign states and also for climate change to become more prominent in the future, becoming
new factors that influence the global security environment.

As seen above, today’s international community confronts a range of issues from traditional inter-state

relations to new threats and diverse contingencies. These issues could arise independently or in combination. In
order to respond to such issues, the roles of military forces are diversifying beyond deterrence and armed conflicts
to include a broad spectrum of activities from conflict prevention to reconstruction assistance. Moreover, unified
responses that incorporate military as well as diplomatic, police, judicial, information and economic measures
are becoming necessary. Accordingly, each state continues to enhance its military capabilities in line with its
resources and circumstances, and pursue international cooperation and partnership in security areas.


-----

**2. Security Environment in the Asia-Pacific Region**
The Asia-Pacific region has been getting more global attention, due to the rapid development of economies such
as China and India resulting in enhanced coordination and cooperation among countries, mainly in economic
affairs. On the other hand, this region is considerably rich in political, economic, ethnic, and religious diversity,
and conflicts between countries/regions remain even after the end of the Cold War, unlike Europe. Because
of these reasons major changes in the security environment have yet to emerge and long-standing issues of
territorial rights and reunification continue to plague the region.

On the Korean Peninsula, the Korean people have been divided for more than half a century, and the face-off

continues between the military forces of North Korea and the Republic of Korea. There are issues concerning
Taiwan and the overlapping territorial claims on the Spratly Islands. Japan also confronts unresolved territorial
disputes over the Northern Territories and Takeshima, both of which are integral parts of Japanese territory.
Concerns over North Korea’s nuclear weapons and ballistic missiles have grown more serious, and in 2006,

its ballistic missile launch and the announcement of an underground nuclear test further underscored the threat
posed by North Korea, not only to the peace and security of Japan, but also to the international community. With
regard to the North Korean nuclear issue, a halt to activities at the nuclear facilities at Yongbyon was achieved
based on a document reached at the Six-Party Talks, but complete disablement of the Yongbyon facilities and a
declaration concerning North Korea’s nuclear programs are still pending, and careful monitoring of the nuclear
issue, including North Korea’s reaction, will continue to be necessary. North Korea’s abduction of Japanese
nationals is also yet to be resolved. It is a major threat to the lives and security of the Japanese public and its
resolution will require sincere and concrete actions by North Korea.
In the Republic of Korea, President Lee Myung-Bak was inaugurated in February 2008, and there are

expectations that he will step up partnerships with the U.S. and Japan towards denuclearization by North
Korea.

Moreover, many countries in this region have taken advantage of economic growth to expand and upgrade

their military forces by increasing their defense budgets and introducing new weapons systems.

In particular, China, a regional power with tremendous political and economic clout, is increasingly drawing

the close attention of many countries. China has been continuously boosting its defense spending and has been
modernizing its military forces, with this significant increase in total defense spending. However, with clarity on
neither the present condition nor the future image, Japan is apprehensive about how the military power of China
will influence the regional state of affairs and the security of Japan. Moreover, due to the insufficient transparency,
it is noted that other nations might have distrust and misunderstandings about the process of decision-making
concerning the security and the military of China. In this fashion, improvement on the transparency relating to
China’s national defense policies is demanded, and it has become an important task to pursue dialogues and
exchanges, and strengthen the mutual understanding and the trust relationship with China.

Under the administration of former President Vladimir Putin, Russia reemerged in the international

community as a “strong state,” and backed by recent economic development Russia is developing a military
posture commensurate with its national strength. In the Far East too, the Russian military has been demonstrating
dynamic movements with its aircraft, following resurgence in aircraft sophistication, and in February 2008,
Japan’s airspace was violated by Russian bombers, underlining the severity of the situation which we must
monitor carefully. (See Fig. I-0-0-1)

Terrorism and piracy in Southeast Asia have seriously affected regional security. Terrorist organizations and

separatist/independence groups have been a threat of terrorism in Indonesia, the Philippines and Thailand. The
Malacca Straits and the Singapore Straits, important international sea lanes of transportation, suffer from frequent
piracy incidents. Joint efforts are underway to combat these threats, and improvements are being witnessed.

In the Asia-Pacific region, where elements of uncertainty and a lack of transparency still exist as described

above, to achieve regional stability the presence of the U.S. military remains extremely important. Japan and
other countries have established bilateral alliances and friendly relations with the U.S. and, accordingly, they
allow the stationing or presence of U.S. forces in their territories.

Recent years have also seen an increase in opportunities for bilateral defense exchanges between countries in

the region. Efforts are being made to engage in multilateral security dialogues, including the ASEAN Regional
Forum (ARF) and conferences hosted by non-governmental institutions with the participation of relevant defense
ministers, as well as bilateral and multilateral joint exercises. Promoting and developing such multi-level
approaches among countries is important to ensure security in the region.

**Section 3. Situation in Iraq**
**Section 4. Complex and Diverse Regional Conflicts**


-----

Section 1. International Terrorism

**1. General Situation**
The 9/11 attacks that took place in 2001 prompted the entire world to reaffirm the threat of international terrorism,
and became the spark that ignited the current fight against terrorism by the United States and other countries.

In the invasion of Afghanistan launched by U.S. and U.K. forces shortly after the 9/11 attacks, many of the

leaders of Al Qaeda, who were believed to have directed the 9/11 attacks, and the Taliban, who harbored Al Qaeda,
were killed or captured. However, Osama bin Laden, Mullah Mohammed Omar and the remnants of their respective
organizations are believed still to be hiding in the Afghanistan-Pakistan border region[1], and the U.S.-led multinational
forces, the Afghan, the Pakistani and other militaries are continuously engaged in clearing operations.

Recently in particular, international terrorist organizations have been organized into more decentralized

cells, while local terrorist organizations and individuals sympathetic to their ideology have been carrying out
terrorist activities on their own or in concert with these international terrorist organizations. Police investigations
revealed, for example, that the July 2005 subway and bus suicide bomb attacks in London (U.K.) were not
carried out by foreign terrorists, but rather by the sons of Muslim immigrants born and brought up in the U.K.[2]
Furthermore, in September 2006, the Algerian organization Salafist Group for Preaching and Combat (GSPC)
formally announced a merger with Al Qaeda, and subsequently changed its name to Al Qaeda in the Islamic
Maghreb (AQIM). This organization is considered to have carried out terrorist attacks last year that targeted the
United Nations and Algerian government organizations.

In light of the present situation, many countries have enacted stronger counterterrorism measures through
domestic legislation. For example, the Russian government passed a new anti-terrorism law in March 2006
that authorizes the downing or sinking of passenger aircraft or vessels hijacked by terrorists, where there is a
danger posed of loss of life or a large-scale disaster. On the other hand, in February 2006, the German Federal
Constitutional Court decided that the provision of the Aviation Security Law stipulating that hijacked planes may
be shot down is unconstitutional and called for its repeal, underlining the fact that views on counterterrorism
measures vary from one country to another.

Furthermore, countries have banded together in an international coalition, continuing to commit not only

military forces, but also diplomatic, law enforcement, judicial, intelligence and economic resources, and
counterterrorism measures are also being implemented through multinational frameworks such as the United
Nations, the G8, and regional cooperation organizations. Specifically, these efforts include ensuring stability
and supplying recovery/reconstruction assistance to Afghanistan and Iraq, enhancing systems for exchanging
counterterrorism intelligence, reinforcing international legal frameworks to sternly punish terrorists, cutting off
terrorist funding and strengthening air security (including the prevention of hijacking), tightening immigration
controls, adopting more effective approaches to ensure the non-proliferation of weapons of mass destruction and
regulation of man-portable air defense systems (MANPADS), assisting developing countries with inadequate
counterterrorism measures to enhance their capabilities, and taking steps to reduce or eliminate poverty, economic
and social disparities and inequality in developing countries.

**2. Fight Against Terrorism in and around Afghanistan**
The United States together with other countries has continued military operations against the Taliban and Al
Qaeda in and around Afghanistan since October 2001, shortly after the 9/11 terrorist attacks. In the Arabian Sea,
naval vessels from various countries have endeavored to keep these international terrorists from relocating to
other areas by sea and to prevent the proliferation of terrorism from Afghanistan.

In Afghanistan, attacks orchestrated by the Taliban have been increasing, and the security situation remains

unstable. The number of terrorist bombings and attacks are particularly prevalent in the southern and eastern


-----

areas adjacent to the border with Pakistan. In addition, there have also been scattered terrorist bomb attacks
in Kabul, the capital of Afghanistan, and in the northern and western areas, which were relatively stable and
peaceful. This situation has led the Afghan military, multinational forces and others to collaborate in mopping-up
operations mainly in the south and east of the country. The International Security Assistance Force (ISAF[3]) has
set up five Regional Commands under the General Headquarters in Kabul, and provides support for the Afghan
government in maintaining peace in the whole of the country. There are also 26 Provincial Reconstruction Teams
(PRTs) to improve the security of the environment, and to conduct reconstruction assistance activities in the
whole of Afghanistan. Similar activities are also continuing through the United Nations Assistance Mission in
Afghanistan (UNAMA).

Pakistan, which borders Afghanistan, is cooperating in the fight against terrorism, with the implementation

of terrorist mopping-up operations in border areas. In addition, it has been confirmed that Pakistan will also
cooperate with Afghanistan in enhancing cooperation to counteract terrorist activities[4]. However, it is assessed
that Al Qaeda and other groups have been providing training to terrorist operatives in the Federally Administered
Tribal Areas (FATA) of Pakistan[5], and it is pointed out that Al Qaeda has reestablished itself in the border area and
now seems to have turned its focus toward Pakistan and attacks on the Pakistani government and people[6].

**3. Terrorist Attacks around the World**
In Iraq, since Saddam Hussein’s regime was brought down by U.S. and U.K. military operations in 2003, it
seems that terrorists have been flowing into Iraq due to degraded security and insufficient border controls, and
terrorist attacks are occurring frequently, targeting not only U.S. and other soldiers, but also Iraqi citizens and
foreign nationals. While the attack capabilities of terrorist groups such as Al Qaeda-affiliated armed groups are
being lowered due to mopping-up operations by multinational forces and Iraqi Security Forces and also due to a
confrontational attitude of the local residents, the activities of these terrorist organizations continue to be a major
obstacle to the rebuilding of Iraq. (See Section 3)
Terrorist attacks have also continued in countries surrounding Iraq. In Turkey, from May to June 2007, a

number of terrorist incidents occurred in Ankara, Istanbul and Izmir on the Aegean Coast, that were considered
to be the work of anti-government organizations such as the Kurdistan Workers’ Party (PKK). In December, in
response to a PKK attack on Turkish army troops in October 2007 near the border with Iraq, the Turkish army
initiated a mopping-up operation, focusing on PKK bases in the Kurdish region of Northern Iraq. In Lebanon also,
against the backdrop of an unstable political situation, in June 2007, a member of parliament was assassinated by
terrorists, and in December 2007, Army General Francois al-Hajj was assassinated.

In Algeria, last year there were a series of terrorist attacks targeting the government and army, including

simultaneous bomb attacks on government buildings, the attempted assassination of the President of Algeria,
a suicide bombing on the barracks of the Algerian Coast Guard, and bombing of U.N. organizations. Al Qaeda
in the Islamic Maghreb (AQIM) claimed responsibility for these attacks. Furthermore, the scope of activities of
AQIM has not remained exclusively in Algerian borders, with it being pointed out that the group is recruiting and
providing training[7] for Islamic extremists in North African countries and plans to expand its mission throughout
the entire region and beyond[8].

Southeast Asia is still a region subject to frequent terrorist threats, although some progress has been made
in controlling terrorist organizations. Between 2002 and 2005, Indonesia suffered large-scale terrorist attacks,
in which the involvement of Jemaah Islamiya (JI), a radical Muslim organization, is suspected[9]. Since 2006,
however, there have been no large terrorist attacks. In 2007 the leaders of JI Zarkasi and Abu Dujana were
arrested, which are notable successes in controlling terrorist activities. In the Philippines, the Communist group
the New People’s Army has long been the largest threat to domestic security. While the Philippine government
has continued to engage in consultations with the Molo Islamic Liberation Front (MILF) towards peace, it


-----

conducts mopping-up operations against the Abu Sayyaf Group (ASG), leading to a number of results, including
the killing of ASG leaders and reduction in membership. At the same time southern Thailand has witnessed
frequent attacks and bombing/arson incidents by radical Muslim separatists against military and police facilities,
and there is currently no prospect of the situation being alleviated.

South Asia, too, has witnessed frequent large-scale terrorist attacks.

In particular, in Pakistan last year former Prime Minister Benazir
Bhutto was assassinated and terrorist attacks targeting government
organizations and security-related facilities such as the military and
police frequently occurred. In 2008 there have been suicide bombings
at a High Court building and at the Naval College. In addition, in
2007 in Sri Lanka, a terrorist attack occurred in the center of Colombo
that is suspected to have been perpetrated by the Liberation Tigers of
Tamil Eelam (LTTE). In January 2008, the ceasefire agreement broke
down between the Sri Lankan government and the LTTE, and it is
feared that this will lead to a future rise in terrorist attacks. (See Fig.

Section 2. Transfer and Proliferation of Weapons of Mass Destruction

The transfer or proliferation of weapons of mass destruction, such as nuclear, biological or chemical weapons
(NBC), or ballistic missiles carrying such weapons has been regarded as a significant threat since the end of the
Cold War. In particular, there have been growing threats that non-state actors, including terrorists, against whom
traditional deterrence works less effectively, could acquire and use weapons of mass destruction (including
radioactive materials).

**1. Nuclear Weapons**
During the Cold War between the United States and the Soviet Union, the Cuban Missile Crisis of 1962 made
it clear that a nuclear war between the United States and the Soviet Union could take place. The Treaty on the
Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons (NPT) that took effect in 1970 prohibited countries other than those
that had conducted nuclear tests in or before 1966[10] from having nuclear weapons, and required nuclear-armed
countries to control and reduce nuclear weapons through bilateral negotiations[11].

Under the NPT signed by 190 countries, the United States, Russia, the United Kingdom, France, and China

are designated as nuclear-armed countries. While some countries that previously had nuclear weapons became
signatories of this treaty by abandoning these weapons[12] some countries still refuse to sign this treaty[13]. In
addition to the five countries permitted to have nuclear weapons, there are other countries that have declared
the development and possession of nuclear weapons. North Korea announced it had conducted a nuclear test in
October 2006.

**2. Biological and Chemical Weapons**
It is easy to manufacture biological and chemical weapons at a relatively low cost. Because most of the materials,
equipment and technology needed to manufacture these weapons can be used for both military and civilian
purposes, it is also easy to disguise them. Accordingly, biological and chemical weapons are attractive to states
or terrorists who seek asymmetric means of attack[14].
Biological weapons have the following characteristics: 1) manufacturing is easy and inexpensive, 2) there
is usually an incubation period of a few days between exposure and onset, 3) their use is hard to detect, 4) even
the threat of use can create great psychological pressures, and 5) they can cause heavy casualties depending on
circumstances and the type of weapons[15].

As for chemical weapons, asphyxiants such as phosgene have been known since World War I. In the Iran-Iraq

War, Iraq repeatedly used mustard gas as an erosion agent and tabun and sarin as nerve agents[16] against Iran. In
the late 1980s, Iraq used chemical weapons to suppress Iraqi Kurds[17]. Other chemical weapons include VX, a
highly toxic nerve agent, and easy-to-manage binary rounds[18].
North Korea (See Chapter 2, Section 2) is one country seeking such weapons. The Tokyo subway sarin attack
in 1995, and mail incidents in the United States containing anthrax bacillus in 2001 and ricin in February 2004,
have showed that the threat of the use of weapons of mass destruction by terrorists is real and that these weapons
could cause serious damage if used in cities.

**3. Ballistic Missiles**
Ballistic missiles can carry heavy payloads over long distances and can be used as a means of projecting weapons
of mass destruction, such as nuclear, biological or chemical weapons. Once launched, a ballistic missile makes
a trajectory flight and falls at a steep angle at high speed, which makes it difficult to effectively defend against
the missile.

If ballistic missiles are deployed in a region where military confrontation is underway, the conflict could


-----

intensify or expand, and tension in a region where armed antagonism exists could be further exacerbated leading
to destabilization of that region. Furthermore a country may use ballistic missiles as a means of attacking or
threatening another country that is superior in terms of conventional forces.

In recent years, in addition to the threat of ballistic missiles, attention has been increasingly paid to the threat

of cruise missiles, because they are comparatively easy for terrorist and other non-state entities to procure[19].
Although the speed of a cruise missile is slower than that of a ballistic missile, it is difficult to detect when the
cruise missile is launched and while in flight[20]. Because cruise missiles are smaller than ballistic missiles, they
can be concealed on a ship to secretly approach a target. Furthermore, a cruise missile carrying a weapon of mass
destruction could present an enormous threat.

**4. Growing Concerns about Transfer or Proliferation of WMDs**
Weapons that were originally purchased or developed for self-defense purposes could be easily exported or
transferred once domestic manufacturing became successful. For example, certain states that do not heed political
risks have transferred weapons of mass destruction and related technologies to other states that cannot afford
to invest resources in conventional forces and intend to compensate for this with weapons of mass destruction.
Some of these states seeking weapons of mass destruction do not hesitate to put their land and people at risk,
and allow terrorist organizations to be active due to their poor governance. Therefore, the chance of actual use of
weapons of mass destruction may generally be high in these cases.

In addition, since it is unlikely that such states can effectively manage the related technology and materials,

the high possibility that chemical or nuclear substances will be transferred or smuggled out from these states has
become a cause for concern. Terrorists without related technology can use a dirty bomb[21] as a means of attack
once acquiring a radioactive substance.

There are shared concerns among countries regarding the acquisition and use of weapons of mass destruction

by terrorists and other non-state entities. Based on these concerns, the United Nations Security Council adopted
Resolution 1540 in April 2004, declaring that all states should adopt and enforce appropriate and effective laws
to prohibit non-state actors from developing, acquiring, manufacturing, possessing, transporting, transferring or
using weapons of mass destruction and the means of delivery thereof, as well as to refrain from assisting such
non-state actors. (See Chapter 3, Section 3) The International Convention for the Suppression of Acts of Nuclear
Terrorism was also adopted by the U.N. General Assembly in April 2005 and entered into force in July 2007.

Activities related to weapons of mass destruction were secretly pursued in some countries. Such activities
have come to light since 2002, revealing the fact that nuclear weapon technologies have been transferred and
proliferated. Meanwhile, the international community’s uncompromising and decisive stance against the transfer
and proliferation of weapons of mass destruction has put enormous pressure on countries engaged in activities
related to such weapons, leading some of them to accept inspection by international institutions or to abandon
their programs to develop weapons of mass destruction.
When U.S. Assistant Secretary of State James Kerry visited North Korea in October 2002, the United States

announced that North Korea had admitted the existence of a project to enrich uranium for use in nuclear weapons,
pointing out the possibility that North Korea had pursued development not only of plutonium-based weapons
but also uranium-based nuclear weapons[22]. It was also pointed out that North Korea had given support to Syrian
secret nuclear activities[23]. (See Chapter 2, Section 2)
It became clear in 2002 that Iran had been long engaged in uranium enrichment-related activities without a

declaration for the IAEA and the international community has made an effort to resolve this issue. (See Section
5)
As a result of behind-the-scenes discussions with the United States and the United Kingdom since March 2003,
Libya abandoned all programs of its weapons of mass destruction in December 2003 and accepted inspections by


-----

international organizations. Subsequently, in August 2006, the country ratified the additional IAEA protocol.
Pakistan seems to have launched its nuclear development program in the 1970s, and nuclear-related activities
of Iran and Libya have been pointed at to be supported by suspicious technology transfers from Pakistan since 2003.
In February 2004, it came to light that nuclear-related technologies, including uranium enrichment technology,
had been transferred to North Korea, Iran and Libya by Dr. A. Q. Khan and other scientists for personal gain.
These transfers have been shown to have been secretly conducted using global networks covering Europe, Africa,
the Middle East and Southeast Asia[24]. IAEA Director-General Mohammad ElBaradei has reportedly stated that
this network involves more than 30 countries[25].

Ballistic missiles have been significantly proliferated or transferred as well. The former Soviet Union exported

Scud-Bs to many countries and regions, including Iraq, North Korea and Afghanistan. China and North Korea
also exported DF-3 (CSS-2) and Scud missiles, respectively. As a result, a considerable number of countries now
possess ballistic missiles. Pakistan’s Ghauri and Iran’s Shahab-3 missiles are said to be based on North Korea’s
No-Dong missiles[26]. Libya, which agreed to abandon its weapons of mass destruction programs, reportedly
disclosed production lines for Scud-Cs and other facilities built with technological assistance of North Korea[27].
It has been reported that Ukraine illegally exported cruise missiles capable of carrying nuclear warheads to Iran
and China around 2001[28].

**5. Iran’s Nuclear Issue**
Since the 1970s Iran has been pursuing a nuclear power plant construction project with cooperation from abroad,
stating that its activities would be for peaceful purposes in accordance with the NPT. In 2002, however, it was
announced by a group of dissidents that Iran was secretly constructing a large-scale uranium enrichment facility.
Subsequent IAEA inspection revealed that Iran, without notifying the IAEA for a long time, had engaged in
uranium enrichment and other activities potentially leading to the development of nuclear weapons. In September
2005, the IAEA Board found Iran’s non compliance with NPT Safeguards Agreement in its resolution. Since
Iran’s nuclear activities were revealed, Iran has insisted that it has no intent to develop nuclear weapons and
that all of its nuclear activities are for peaceful purposes. On the other hand, the international community has
expressed strong concerns about obtaining assurances of Iran’s claims, and has demanded that Iran suspend all of
its enrichment related and reprocessing activities until it can confirm that its nuclear development activities are
exclusively for peaceful purposes.
The EU-3 (the United Kingdom, France and Germany) held discussions with Iran in hopes of resolving
this issue; an accord (the Paris Accord) was reached in November 2004 on issues including the halt of uranium
enrichment related activities; and Iran accordingly ceased its nuclear-related activities. However, Iran rejected
as unsatisfactory the proposal for a Long-Term Agreement presented by the EU-3 in August 2005, and resumed
uranium conversion activities which are at the precursory stage of uranium enrichment. It announced the start
of preparations for the resumption of uranium enrichment in January 2006 (Iran resumed uranium enrichment
in February). The IAEA then convened an emergency Board of Governors meeting in February 2006 and
by a majority vote adopted a resolution to report the issue to the U.N. Security Council. In March 2006, the
U.N. Security Council approved a Presidential Statement calling on Iran to halt its uranium enrichment and
reprocessing activities, but in April, Iran announced that it had successfully achieved low-grade (3.5%) uranium
enrichment[29] and pursued its policy to continue uranium enrichment-related activities.
In June 2006, a comprehensive proposal was presented to Iran as an agreement with the EU-3, and U.S., China
and Russia (EU3+3). The proposal included cooperation in the event that Iran sufficiently resolved international
concern[30]; however Iran continued its nuclear activities. In view of these responses, the U.N. Security Council in
July adopted Resolution 1696 demanding Iran to suspend all of its uranium enrichment-related and reprocessing
activities. Since Iran continued its enrichment-related activities, the U.N. Security Council adopted Resolution
1737[31] in December 2006 and Resolution 1747[32] in March 2007, followed further by Resolution 1803[33] in March


-----

2008, to impose stricter sanctions in accordance with Article 41, Chapter VII of the U.N. Charter. Meanwhile, the
U.S. released a National Intelligence Estimate, “Iran: Nuclear Intentions and Capabilities.” Judgments of the report
included “Iranian military entities were working under
government direction to develop nuclear weapons. In
fall 2003, Tehran halted its nuclear weapons program.
Tehran at a minimum is keeping open the option to
develop nuclear weapons.”

Despite the demands by the international community

including the U.N. Security Council Resolutions, Iran’s
nuclear issue remains unresolved. For example, in April
2008 President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad announced that
Iran had started tests of new centrifuges which are five
times faster than the present models. The international
community including the U.N. Security Council is
continuing to pursue peaceful and diplomatic solutions
through negotiations in order to resolve the issue.

Section 3. Situation in Iraq

**1. Security Situation in Iraq and Security Measures**
In 2006, the bombing of a Shiite mosque in Samarra in central Iraq triggered an intensification of sectarian
violence, leading to deterioration in the security situation particularly in Baghdad, and presenting a serious
obstacle to political processes and economic reconstruction in Iraq. In response to this situation, and based
on consultations with the Government of Iraq and others, U.S. President George W. Bush announced a new
policy for Iraq in January 2007, which included a “surge,” with the dispatch of more than 20,000 U.S. military
personnel. In addition, Prime Minister Nouri al-Maliki of Iraq launched renewed public security measures in
Baghdad and other regions in February 2007.

Through the cooperation of Iraq, the United States and other countries, some improvements have been
witnessed in the overall public security situation from the latter half of 2007, with reductions in the number
of security incidents and casualties of terrorist attacks. In particular, Al Anbar Province in western Iraq, which
was formerly a hotbed of terrorism second only to Baghdad, has shown significant improvements in public
security. Factors for this improvement in public security include: the increased numbers of multinational forces
and Iraqi security forces, the conduct of counterinsurgency operations to safeguard the Iraqi people and to pursue
terrorists, and the collective efforts of the Iraqi people who have come to contribute to local security through the
attitudinal shift, and the declaration of a ceasefire by a
Shiite leader al-Sadr[34].

Attacks on multinational forces, Iraqi security

forces and civilians by terrorists and Islamic extremists
continue by a variety of means such as improvised
explosive devices (IEDs) and vehicle-borne improvised
explosive devices (VBIEDs). The security situation
in Iraq is therefore still fragile and unpredictable. In
addition, the influence of neighboring countries has
also been noted. In particular, it is reported that Iran
has been providing weapons and training to Iraqi
militia organizations, and also that Islamic radicals are
infiltrating Iraq from Syria regardless of the effort of
the Government of Syria[35].

**2. Trends in Multinational Forces in Iraq**
As of May 2008, military units from 26 countries, including approximately 150,000 U.S. troops, are deployed
in Iraq tasked with maintaining security and reconstruction assistance. The basic idea underlying the activities
of the multinational forces is that the presence of such forces is necessary until Iraqi security forces are able to
maintain security on their own[36]. Consequently, the multinational forces assert that they cannot set out in advance
a deadline for terminating their activities, even while insisting that their involvement in Iraq is not indefinite.
In general terms, while the capability of Iraqi security forces is improving, it is thought that more time will be
needed until these forces are able to maintain order and stability in Iraq independently.

Meanwhile, the transfer of security responsibilities from multinational forces to Iraqi authorities is

proceeding in the provinces in which the capabilities of Iraqi security forces have been enhanced and local
conditions have improved. Thus far, the security responsibility has been transferred in 10 provinces, including
southeastern Muthanna Province, in which the Ground Self-Defense Force (GSDF) was engaged in humanitarian
and reconstruction assistance activities. (See Fig. I-1-3-1)

Based on these changes in the situation in Iraq, there have also been changes in the scale of multinational
forces. In April 2008, the United States announced that given progress in the security situation in Iraq, the
“surge” troops would be returned home by the end of July. Following that, it was noted that time would be
required to assess the overall situation before an additional judgment was made on further troop reductions.
In October 2007 the United Kingdom announced the reduction of 2,500 troops stationed in Iraq. However,
following clashes between Iraqi security forces and militias in Basra Province in southeastern Iraq, in April 2008
the United Kingdom announced a temporary halt to troop reductions, stating that it would maintain a force of
around 4,000 troops for the time being.
In December 2007, the U.N. Security Council adopted Resolution 1790, extending the mandate of the
multinational force until the end of 2008. However, in a document submitted to the United Nations Security
Council requesting an extension of the stationing of multinational forces, Prime Minister al-Maliki announced
that the Government of Iraq considers this to be its final request for the extension of the mandate of multinational
force. Based on these developments, the Governments of Iraq and the United States are proceeding with
deliberations concerning the future stationing of multinational forces.

**3. Efforts by the Iraqi Government and International Community toward Reconstruction**
Breakthroughs in the situation in Iraq will require not only security measures, but also political efforts by the
Iraqi government on its own initiative to promote national reconciliation. In January 2008, the Iraqi Council
of Representatives adopted a number of significant laws, including the Accountability and Justice Law, which
enables former Ba’ath Party members who were purged from public offices since 2003 to reassume public


-----

positions. This represents a significant step forward toward the realization of national reconciliation in Iraq.

In addition, many countries have contributed to Iraqi reconstruction through the dispatch of troops and
bilateral and multilateral assistance programs. Since 2005, the United States and others have deployed Provincial
Reconstruction Teams (PRTs) made up of military and civilian personnel to provide support to local governments
in Iraq. The United States has also increased the number of PRTs as part of a process giving greater emphasis
to military and non-military cooperation, and currently PRTs led by the U.S. and others conduct activities in
all provinces of Iraq. The United Nations has also
been coordinating reconstruction, development and
humanitarian assistance through the United Nations
Assistance Mission for Iraq (UNAMI).

The Iraq Compact, an international framework to

build a new partnership between the Iraqi government
and the international community, was launched in May
2007. The Compact stipulates the common policy
objectives and the measures to be taken, of both the
Iraqi government and international community for the
next five years in the areas of governance, security, and
economic reconstruction. Discussion between the U.S. Military and the Iraq Military Officer concerning joint

Section 4. Complex and Diverse Regional Conflicts

Complex and diverse regional conflicts are emerging around the world. The characteristics of regional conflicts
differ from one to another, whether they be inter-state or intra-state conflicts. They may result from various ethnic,
religious, territorial, or resource-related issues, and may range in form from armed conflict to sustained armed
confrontation. Besides, it is often seen that human rights violations, refugees, famine, poverty, and terrorism
resulting from the conflicts become international issues. For that reason, it has become increasingly important
for the international community to examine the character of complex and diverse conflicts and to determine
appropriate responses, including the form of international frameworks and the way of international involvement
depending on the character of conflicts. (See Fig. I-1-4-1)

The Middle East has witnessed four wars between Israel and Palestinians or Arab states since the foundation
of Israel in 1948. Israel concluded peace treaties with Egypt in 1979 and with Jordan in 1994; however, has yet
to realize peace with other states.
The Oslo Agreement concluded in 1993 marked the beginning of a peace process through comprehensive

negotiations; however, the Israelis and Palestinians subsequently suspended negotiations due to the intifada that
started in 2000 and resulted in reciprocal violence between the two parties. In 2003, agreement was reached
between the Israelis and Palestinians on a “Road Map” that laid out a course leading to the establishment of
a Middle East peace initiative between the Israelis and the Palestinians based on the principle of the peaceful
coexistence between the two nations. However, the Road Map has yet to be implemented. The Israelis will not
compromise on ensuring their own security and have demanded that the Palestinians disband terrorist groups.
Furthermore, the Israeli government has taken a stern approach toward the Palestinians, stating that in the event
that they do not make appropriate responses, the government will no longer regard the Palestinians as a dialogue
partner and will unilaterally build a barrier and draw de facto borders. On the Palestinian side, the Islamic


-----

fundamentalist organization Hamas, which does not recognize Israel and which advocates a continuation of
armed conflict against Israel, won the Palestine Legislative Council election in January 2006 and established a
Hamas-led administration in March. Political turmoil continues as the rivalry between Fatah, the largest faction of
the Palestine Liberation Organization (PLO), and Hamas has intensified, and as clashes among Palestinians have
led to an increasing number of deaths. In June 2007, President Mahmoud Abbas declared a state of emergency for
the entire autonomous region after Hamas seized the Gaza Strip. Thereupon, an emergency cabinet constructed
of non-Hamas ministers was established; however, the Hamas de facto rule of Gaza continues.
The United States hosted the Annapolis Conference in November 2007, where agreement was reached

between Israel and the PLO to commence dialogue towards the conclusion of a peace treaty within this year.
However, both Israel and the PLO continue to engage in behavior that could negatively impact the peace process,
such as rocket attacks by Palestinian insurgents in Gaza targeting Israeli territory, military campaigns by the
Israeli army in response to those attacks and the Israeli Government’s announcement of a plan to build houses
in the settlements.

Israel has yet to sign peace treaties with Syria and Lebanon. Israel and Syria disagree on the return of the
Golan Heights which Israel has occupied since the 1967 Arab-Israel War. The United Nations Disengagement
Observer Force (UNDOF) is deployed in the Golan Heights region to observe the implementation of ceasefire
and military disengagement between the two nations.

Concerning Israel and Lebanon, the United Nations Interim Force in Lebanon (UNIFIL) increased its presence
following the 2006 clash between Israel and Hezbollah, a Shiite Muslim organization. There have not been any
prominent conflicts since, however political instability has continued in Lebanon, such as in the inability to elect
a president—a situation that began in November 2007 and has lasted to May of this year. Furthermore, there have
been indications that Hezbollah is enhancing its military strength again.

India and Pakistan separated and gained their independence after World War II. Thereafter, large-scale armed

conflicts have broken out three times between the two countries over the Kashmir dispute and other issues.
Nevertheless, a certain degree of progress regarding bilateral relations has been made in recent years.

On the Korean Peninsula, there are currently tense confrontations between the Republic of Korea (ROK)

and North Korea across the Demilitarized Zone (DMZ), with a presence of approximately 1.5 million ground
forces. This military confrontation has been ongoing since the Korean War (1950-1953) armistice. (See Chapter
2, Section 2)

In Nepal, armed conflict with the Maoist faction of the Nepal Communist Party has resulted in a significant

number of casualties since 1996. As a result of the pro-democracy movement, a new government was formed in
April 2006, and a Comprehensive Peace Agreement was signed in November between the Nepalese Government
and the Maoists. In response to this agreement, the United Nations Political Mission in Nepal (UNMIN) has been
deployed in accordance with U.N. Security Council Resolution 1740, and among its duties are to monitor the
status of weapons and soldiers.

In Africa, numerous civil wars have erupted after the achievement of independence in various nations.

Although there have been some pushes for national reconstruction efforts in recent years, some nations are still
suffering from severe conflicts.

In Sudan, the Sudanese Government, which is predominantly composed of Muslim Arabs from northern

Sudan and anti-government forces comprised of African Christians from southern Sudan demanding autonomy,
distribution of revenue from oil, and religious freedom, continued a 20-year north-south civil war that stemmed
from a 1983 declaration by the Government to apply Islamic law to all of Sudan. In response to the Comprehensive
Peace Agreement (CPA) that was signed between the north and south in 2005, the United Nations Mission in
Sudan (UNMIS), established by Resolution 1590 of the United Nations Security Council, has been deployed and
is conducting truce monitoring activities to assist the implementation of the CPA.

In the Darfur region of western Sudan, in addition to

the traditional opposition between the Arabic nomadic
tribes and the settled African population, disputes
over local autonomy and developmental disparities,
led to intensified fighting in 2003 between the Arab
government and the African anti-government forces
(both Muslim). The conflict in Darfur has produced a
large number of internally displaced persons and an
outflow of refugees into neighboring nations, which the
international community, including the United Nations,
regards as a serious humanitarian crisis. Following the

UNMIS personnel in Sudan [©U.N. Photo/Fred Noy]

ceasefire agreement in 2004, the African Union (AU)
dispatched the African Union Mission in Sudan (AMIS);
however, their efforts to halt the conflict were unsuccessful. For this reason, after the government and a fraction
of the major anti-government forces signed the Darfur Peace Agreement (DPA) in May 2006, the U.N. Security
Council adopted Resolution 1769 in July 2007, which stipulated the creation of the AU/UN Hybrid Operation in
Darfur (UNAMID). However, instability in the Darfur region continues as some of the anti-government forces
refuse to sign the DPA and as the deployment of UNAMID units has been delayed.

As to Chad and Central Africa, which have seen an outflow of refugees from the Darfur region, the U.N.
Security Council Resolution 1778 adopted in September 2007 authorized the deployment of the European
Union (EU) forces and the creation of the United Nations Mission in the Central African Republic and Chad
(MINURCAT). Although the deployment of EU forces and others is currently underway in Chad, activities by
insurgents also continue. For example, insurgency forces invaded N’Djamena, the capital of Chad, to battle the
government forces.
Somalia had been in a state of anarchy since 1991, but in June 2005, the Transitional Federal Government
(TFG) established in Kenya returned to Somalia. Fighting intensified from 2006 between the TFG and the Union
of Islamic Courts (UIC), an Islamic fundamentalist organization. The TFG forces along with the Ethiopian forces
deployed in Somalia at the request of the TFG, brought order to the south central area including the capital
of Mogadishu in January 2007. In the same month, the African Union Mission in Somalia (AMISOM) was
established. Although armed attacks against the TFG and Ethiopian forces continued, the peace agreement was
signed between the TFG and Alliance for the Re-liberation of Somalia (ARS) which was formed by UIC and
other groups, this June in Djibouti, on condition of the dispatch of U.N. peacekeeping operation within 120 days
and the withdrawal of the Ethiopian forces. However, the situation remains fragile, as piracy and armed robbery
acts occurring in the surrounding waters of Somalia exacerbate the country’s situation[37], making it difficult to
predict.

**COMMENTARY**

**The Impact of Climate Change on the Security Environment**

In November 2007, the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) of the United Nations announced
a report claiming that warming of the climate system is unequivocal, as is now evident from observations
of increases in global average air and ocean temperatures, widespread melting of snow and ice, and rising
global average sea level.

Against a background of increasing interest in climate change caused by global warming, a movement to
consider the impact of climate change on security has become pervasive. In April 2007, a panel discussion on
the impact of climate change on security was held at the U.N. Security Council, in which 55 nations including
non-Council member states participated, representing the above-mentioned movement. In addition, at the
EU Summit in March 2008, a report proposing enhancement of crisis management capabilities including
military to contribute to the response to the security risks posed by climate change was submitted and placed
on the agenda. Furthermore, climate change was raised as a potential security threat in the British National
Security Strategy published in March 2008.

As pointed out in these discussions and documents, climate change is believed to have a wide range of

impacts on the security environment.

For example, the lack of water, food, and land caused by rising sea level and increasing extraordinary

weather, combined with population growth, is believed to trigger large-scale migrations, thereby inciting
and worsening ethnic and religious antagonisms and resource-related conflicts. The Darfur crisis may be
attributed to the migration of Arabic nomads facing serious droughts and land scarcity caused by climate
change into the neighborhoods where black inhabitants follow the plow.

In addition, increasing extraordinary weather is believed to increase large-scale disasters. Accordingly,

each country’s military is expected to have more opportunities to be dispatched for such duties as rescue
operations, humanitarian and reconstruction assistance operations, and security duties. The U.S. has pointed
out the importance of military support as its own lessons learned from dealing with Hurricane Katrina in
August 2005.

Furthermore, as melting of sea ice in the Arctic Sea can lead to easier access to undersea resources, coastal

nations, trying to ensure ocean interests, begin to embark on seafloor investigations to claim extension of
continental shelves and enhance military posture in the Arctic areas.

Thus, the perception that climate change can affect the security environment in various ways has been

increasingly shared. It is important for Japan to pay attention to the impact of climate change on the security
environment.

Section 1. The United States

**1. Security and Defense Policies**
The United States recognizes that even with its geographic insularity surrounded by uncontested borders and
shielded by two oceans, the insularity no longer confers security for the country against direct attacks, as the
September 11, 2001 terrorist attacks showed. Against this backdrop, the United States has decided to give top
priority in its national security to homeland defense.

The National Security Strategy[1] released in March 2006 states that the United States can protect its nation

by leading efforts of the international community to end tyranny and promote democracy. The United States,
however, cannot achieve such idealistic goals alone, and so it is committed to taking a realistic approach that
relies on cooperation with allies, partners, and the international community.

The Quadrennial Defense Review (QDR)[2] released in February 2006 states that the United States is in a “long

war” against terrorist networks and needs to reorient the capabilities of U.S. forces to address the new security
challenges and to improve capabilities dealing with irregular, catastrophic, and disruptive challenges (See 1
below) while sustaining capabilities to address traditional challenges.

Furthermore, the QDR repeatedly stresses that, as the Department of Defense cannot independently win the

“long war” that the United States faces today, it is essential to bear all elements of national power at home and to
work in close cooperation with allies and partners abroad.

**1. Assessment of Security Environment**
The United States considers that the security environment of today is different from that of the Cold War era in
that it is difficult to predict who, where, and when will pose threats to and attack the United States, while during
the Cold War the Soviet Union was clearly recognized as the enemy. The National Defense Strategy[3] identifies
four challenges that the United States is expected to face in today’s uncertain security environment in the course
of protecting its freedom and interests. These challenges overlap, and can occur simultaneously.
1) Traditional challenges: Threats of military conflicts among nations employing conventional forces;
2) Irregular challenges: Threats employing such irregular methods as terrorism and insurgency to erode U.S.

influence;
3) Catastrophic challenges: Threats involving the acquisition, possession, and use of weapons of mass destruction

(WMD) or methods producing WMD-like effects;
4) Disruptive challenges: Threats coming from adversaries who are seeking to exploit U.S. vulnerabilities by

using technology, etc., to offset the present U.S. advantage on the account of technical advancement in the
fields of biotechnology, cyber operations, space weapons, and such.

**2. Defense Strategy**
The United States outlines the strategic objectives in the security environment as follows: 1) securing the United
States from direct attack; 2) securing strategic access and retaining global freedom of action; 3) strengthening
alliances and partnerships; and 4) establishing favorable security conditions. In addition, the National Defense
Strategy describes the following four measures to accomplish these strategic objectives:
1) Assure allies and friends by fulfilling alliance and other defense commitments;
2) Dissuade potential enemies from adopting threatening capabilities, methods and ambitions by sustaining and

developing the military advantage of the United States;
3) Deter aggression and coercion by maintaining capable and rapidly deployable military forces and, when

necessary, demonstrating the strong will to resolve conflicts;
4) Defeat adversaries by employing military power, as necessary, together with other instruments when deterrence

fails.


-----

Furthermore, the National Defense Strategy shows the following four implementation guidelines to be

followed in pursuing the aforementioned strategic goals:
1) Active, layered defense: It is necessary to defeat challenges to the United States early and at a safe distance.

Therefore, preventive actions such as security cooperation, forward deterrence, and non-proliferation initiatives
are critical. As these actions cannot be implemented solely by the United States, cooperation with allies and
friends is essential. It is also necessary to improve the capabilities to defend the homeland by strengthening
missile defense and other defensive measures.
2) Continuous transformation[4]: In order that the United States ensures its advantage, it is necessary to continuously

transform U.S. forces by changing long-standing business processes within the Department of Defense and its
relationship with interagency and international partners as well as methods of fighting (concepts or warfare,
definition of threat, operation style, organization,
and composition of weapons).
3) “Capabilities-based” approach: In the current security

environment, it is difficult to predict when and where
threats to the United States will emerge. However,
it is possible to predict the capabilities that enemies
will employ to attack the United States. Therefore,
the United States focuses on what capabilities are
needed to counter enemy capabilities.
4) Managing risks: The United States identifies

various risks that may arise in pursuing the strategic
objectives with limited resources, and controls them
properly[5].

**3. Priority Areas for Capability Development**
The 2006 QDR states that it is necessary to improve capabilities dealing with irregular, catastrophic, and
disruptive challenges while sustaining capabilities to address traditional challenges on the basis of the security
environment and the defense strategy described above. Specifically, it lists the following four priority areas for
capability development:
1) Defeating terrorist networks: In order to win the fight against terrorism, it is necessary to deter the terrorist

networks from securing their sanctuaries by attacking them relentlessly. Therefore, in addition to developing
intelligence gathering capabilities and special operation capabilities, U.S. forces strengthen their cooperation
with interagency partners and provide training to security forces of other countries. To defeat terrorist networks
in a battle of ideas as well as in a battle of arms, U.S. forces will strengthen their Strategic Communication and
improve language and cultural awareness.
2) Defending the homeland in depth: In order to cope with threats to the homeland of the United States, it

is essential to strengthen cooperation with interagency partners as well as to maintain the posture to deter
invasion. To implement this, U.S. forces need not only to strengthen their deterrence by missile defense
and other defense measures, but also to increase capabilities of consequence management in response to
emergencies.
3) Shaping the choices of countries at strategic crossroads: While the United States encourages the countries

that have the potential to affect future security to become constructive partners by expanding its security
cooperation and other measures, it hedges against the possibility that cooperative approaches may fail by
strengthening the capabilities of allies and partners, further diversifying its basing posture, and maintaining its
military primacy in key areas.


-----

4) Preventing the acquisition or use of weapons of mass destruction: The United States needs to take both

preventive and responsive measures so that it addresses the threat of WMD by adversaries. U.S. forces develop
capabilities to lessen the damage in case of WMD attacks while they strengthen their capabilities to identify
and track WMD and their related materials as preventive measures. (See Fig. I-2-1-1)

**4. Force Planning**
The 2001 QDR described that the United States adopted an approach to construct its forces for the following
four objectives: 1) to defend the United States; 2) to maintain forward-deployed forces in four critical regions
(Europe, Northeast Asia, the East Asia littoral, and the Middle East/Southwest Asia); 3) to defeat adversaries
swiftly in two types of operation in overlapping time frames and to defeat an adversary decisively in one of the
two theaters; and 4) to conduct a limited number of small-scale contingencies.

However, since the lessons learned from experiences in the fight against terrorism suggest that U.S. forces

need to operate around the globe and not only in and from the four critical regions and that “swiftly defeating” or
“winning decisively” against adversaries may be less useful for some types of operations, such as a long duration,
irregular warfare campaign, the 2006 QDR concludes that while continuing to take the capabilities-based
approach, the United States has refined its force planning construct, dividing its activities into three objective
areas: 1) homeland defense; 2) fight against terrorism/irregular (asymmetric) warfare; and 3) conventional
campaigns.
1) Homeland defense: In steady state, U.S. forces deter external threats to the homeland of the United States and


-----

provide necessary support to interagency partners by conducting joint training and other measures so that they
can contribute to homeland defense. In surge, they respond to attacks by means of WMD and other weapons,
and also take measures to minimize the damage from them.
2) War on terror/irregular warfare: In steady state, U.S. forces deter transnational terrorist attacks through

forward-deployed forces, and also strengthen capabilities of allies and friends and conduct counterinsurgency
operations. In surge they conduct a potentially long-duration irregular warfare campaign, whose level of effort
is equal to that of the operations presently conducted in Iraq and Afghanistan.
3) Conventional campaigns: In steady state, U.S. forces deter invasions or coercion by other countries through

forward-deployed forces, and also strengthen capabilities of allies and friends through security cooperation
such as military exchanges and joint exercises. In surge, they wage two nearly simultaneous conventional
campaigns (or one conventional campaign if already engaged in a large-scale, long-duration irregular
campaign), while reinforcing deterrence against opportunistic acts of aggression. (See Fig. I-2-1-2)

**5. Defense Posture Review of U.S. Forces**
The United States is currently working on the review of its global defense posture. The Bush administration
explained in August 2004 that, over the next 10 years, the plan “will bring home about 60,000 to 70,000 uniformed
personnel and approximately 100,000 family members and civilian employees.” By reviewing the posture of its
forces, the United States will redeploy most of its large-scale forces that have been stationed forward to cope


-----

with threats in the Cold War era to homeland, and strengthen its cooperation with allies and others, while making
efforts to further improve rapid reaction capabilities by moving its most rapidly deployable forces forward in
case of emergencies in unpredictable locations. Also, by capitalizing on force transformation, the United States
aims to improve the capabilities of the forward-deployed force, while attempting to restore the morale and
readiness of the military forces by sending many service members who are stationed abroad back to the United
States. (See Fig. I-2-1-3)

Note: Materials are taken from published documents of the U.S. Department of Defense (as of December 31, 2007) and others.

As specific measures in this posture review, in Europe the United States will deploy Striker Brigade Combat

Teams[6], reinforce the airborne brigade, and create a joint task force as well as build new bases and training
facilities in Eastern European countries. On the other hand, with regard to personnel, two army divisions will be
sent back to the homeland and U.S. forces stationed in Europe will be reduced to 24,000 personnel[7]. However,
as preparations for the living quarters of troops returning home remain unfinished, and due to security requisites
in the European theater, it has been decided that the plan to reduce two U.S. brigade combat teams in Germany
will be postponed for several years[8].

As for Asia, the United States announced that it would improve the capabilities of U.S. forces to deter,

dissuade, and defeat challenges in the region through strengthened long-range strike capability, streamlined
and consolidated headquarters, and a network of access agreements. Specifically, the United States is working
on: 1) the forward stationing of additional expeditionary maritime capabilities in the Pacific[9]; 2) deployment of
advanced strike assets in the Western Pacific[10]; 3) restructuring U.S. military presence and command structure in
Northeast Asia (See Section 2-3 and Part II, Chapter 2; and 4) establishing a network of sites to provide training
opportunities and contingency access in Central and Northeast Asia[11].

In Africa, in October 2007, the United States established the United States Africa Command with the area

of responsibility covering Africa, which was previously covered by three Commands – the U.S. European


-----

Command, U.S. Central Command and U.S. Pacific Command – and preliminary operations were launched under
European Command[12]. U.S. Africa Command is a joint command that aims to improve the capacity of African
nations to deal with conflicts in their own region, through the provision of military assistance in the form of
training for peacekeeping, etc., and the purpose of its establishment is to help African leaders to deal with Africa’s
problems[13].

**6. Nuclear Strategy**
The Nuclear Posture Review (NPR) announced in 2002 declares a U.S. shift in nuclear force planning from an
approach based on threats of Russia: the United States should maintain the minimum required nuclear forces for the
security of the United States, its allies, and friends, and the United States must have new deterrent force composed
of nuclear forces, conventional forces, and defense systems (missile defense). The NPR asserts that deterrence
should shift from the old triad in the Cold War era comprising: 1) intercontinental ballistic missiles (ICBM); 2)
submarine-launched ballistic missiles (SLBM); and 3) strategic bombers; to a new triad of: 1) non-nuclear and
nuclear strike capabilities; 2) active and passive defense systems; and 3) defense infrastructure (defense industry,
procurement system, and others). The new triad depends less on nuclear weapons by emphasizing the importance
of missile defense and conventional forces (advanced weapons in particular), and makes deterrence more reliable
in an environment where WMD are proliferating. The 2006 QDR follows the concept of the new triad defined in
the NPR and declares that the United States holds a wider range of conventional strike capabilities and missile
defense capabilities, while maintaining a nuclear deterrent[14]. The Secretary of Defense is to review the NPR
within 2009 and to submit a report to Congress based on the National Defense Authorization Act of FY 2008[15].

**7. FY 2009 Budget**
The United States faces the challenge of how to distribute limited resources between the dual requirements
of fighting the war on terror and securing its military advantage into the future. The defense budget for FY
2009 represents the base budget of the Department of Defense, excluding the budget for the Global War on
Terror (GWOT), and attaches importance to: 1) maintaining a highly trained fighting force and increasing ground
forces; 2) improving quality of life for personnel and families such as pay increases and health care; 3) procuring

and maintaining an arsenal of the world’s most advanced weapon systems; 4) improving war fighting capabilities
and investing in science and technology; 5) maintaining facilities at sites in the U.S. and around the globe;
and 6) maintaining vital intelligence capabilities. The concluded budget for FY 2009 represents an increase in
legislative terms of 7.5%, amounting to $515.4 billion.

Furthermore, the budget for the GWOT has been included in the Department of Defense base budget from FY

2008, and as an emergency allowance for the GWOT the defense budget for FY 2009 has allocated $70 billion[16].
(See Fig. I-2-1-4)

**2. Military Posture**
Regarding nuclear forces, the United States completed the reduction of the number of its strategic nuclear weapons
in accordance with the Strategic Arms Reduction Treaty I (START I) by December 2001, the deadline set in
the treaty. The current nuclear forces of the United States consist of 550 ICBMs, 14 SSBNs (Ballistic Missile
Submarine, Nuclear-Powered), 432 SLBMs, 113 strategic bombers, and 5,914 nuclear warheads. In addition the
United States intends to decrease the number of its operationally deployed strategic nuclear warheads to between
1,700 and 2,200 by the end of 2012 in accordance with the Strategic Offensive Reductions Treaty (“Moscow
Treaty”). Furthermore, in December 2007, President Bush approved a significant reduction in the U.S. nuclear
weapons stockpile by the end of 2007[17].

The U.S. ground forces consist of approximately 520,000 soldiers, and approximately 190,000 marines, which

are forward-deployed in Germany, the ROK and Japan, among other countries. To cope with the fight against
terrorism, U.S. ground forces are reorganizing their combat and support troops into brigade-sized modular units[18].
The U.S. Marine Corps is enhancing its special operations forces, which have been playing an important role
in the fight against terrorism and in military operations in Iraq. It newly established the Marine Corps Special
Operations Command (MARSOC[19]) in February 2006, thereby improving its ability to cope with irregular warfare.
Furthermore, to meet operational demands in Iraq and Afghanistan, and in order to expand the capabilities of
armed forces and to reduce stress on the force and the personnel caused by deployment in the GWOT, the U.S.
government asked Congress that ground forces be increased by 65,000 and Marine Corps forces by 27,000, with
Army end strength being increased to 547,000 and Marine Corps end strength to 202,000 by 2012[20].

U.S. maritime forces consist of approximately 950 vessels

(including approximately 70 submarines) totaling about 5.77 million
tons. The 2nd Fleet is deployed to the Atlantic Ocean, the 6th Fleet
to the Mediterranean Sea, the 5th Fleet to the Persian Gulf, Red Sea
and northwest Indian Ocean, the 3rd Fleet to the eastern Pacific, and
the 7th Fleet to the western Pacific and Indian Ocean. It has been
announced that the 4th Fleet, which has jurisdiction over Central
and South America, the Caribbean and surrounding waters, will be
redeployed from July 2008[21]. In addition, the 2006 QDR announces
that the United States will deploy at least six operationally available
and sustainable carriers and 60% of its submarines in the Pacific in
order to increase its military presence in the ocean.

The U.S. air forces consist of roughly 3,940 combat aircraft across

the Air Force, Navy, and Marine Corps. In addition to carrier-based
aircraft deployed at sea, part of the tactical air force is forwarddeployed in Germany, the United Kingdom, Japan and the ROK. In

SM-3 launched from the U.S. cruiser to shoot down an the 2006 QDR, it is noted that the United States will strengthen its
uncontrollable reconnaissance satellite offensive capabilities with conventional weapons by developing a

new land-based, penetrating long-range strike capability to be fielded by 2018, modernizing B-52, B-1, and B-2
bombers, and accelerating the procurement of unmanned aerial vehicles. On the other hand, it states that the
number of the Air Force end strength will be reduced by about 40,000 full-time equivalent personnel.

As for mobility to deploy U.S. forces to distant locations, the United States is procuring C-17 transport

aircraft and modernizing C-5 transport aircraft to improve the transport capabilities of the forces[22], and prepositioning equipment at various theaters.

Furthermore, the United States is aiming to introduce a Missile Defense (MD) system to Europe around 2011

or 2012, and negotiations are ongoing with the Czech Republic and Poland with regard to the partial deployment
of the system in their territories[23].

The U.S. forces are increasingly depending on space systems for intelligence collection and communications.

The country announced the U.S. National Space Policy in 2006, in which it states that space capabilities are vital
to its national interests and that it will preserve its freedom of action in space, deter others from impeding its
space systems, take those actions necessary to protect its space systems, and deny, if necessary, the use of space
that is hostile to the United States[24].

**3. Military Posture in the Asia-Pacific Region**
The United States, which is also a Pacific nation, continues to play an important role in ensuring the peace and
stability of the Asia-Pacific region by deploying the Pacific Command, a joint command consisting of the Army,
Navy, Air Force, and Marine Corps.

The Army is composed of two divisions and deploys a total of approximately 18,000 personnel split between

the 25th Infantry Division deployed in Hawaii, and the 2nd Infantry Division and 19th Sustainment Command in
the ROK, in addition to approximately 2,000 personnel in Japan, including from the I Corps (Forward) and the
Commander, U.S. Forces Japan[25].

The Navy consists of the 7th Fleet, which is in charge of the area including the western Pacific and Indian

Ocean, and the 3rd Fleet, which is in charge of the area including the eastern Pacific Ocean and Bering Sea, under
the Pacific Fleet, the headquarters of which is located in Hawaii, totaling approximately 180 vessels. The 7th
Fleet is comprised mainly of one carrier strike group, with main bases in Japan and Guam. Its major mission is to
defend and protect the territory, citizens, sea lanes, allies, and other vital interests of the United States, and ships
assigned to the Pacific Fleet including carriers, amphibious ships, and Aegis cruisers.

The Marine Corps deploys one Marine Expeditionary Force in each of the U.S. mainland and Japan under the

Pacific Marine Corps, which has its headquarters in Hawaii. Of this force approximately 14,000 personnel are in
the 3rd Marine Division and the 1st Marine Aircraft Wing, which is equipped with F/A-18 and other aircraft and
are both deployed in Japan. In addition, maritime pre-positioning ships loaded with heavy equipment and others
are deployed in the western Pacific.

The Air Force deploys three air forces under the Pacific Air Force, the headquarters of which is in Hawaii. It

deploys three air wings equipped with F-15, F-16, and C-130 aircraft in the 5th Air Force stationed in Japan, and
two air wings equipped with F-16 fighters in the 7th Air Force stationed in the ROK.

Section 2. Korean Peninsula

On the Korean Peninsula, people of the same ethnicity have been divided into two – north and south – for more
than half a century. Even today, the Republic of Korea (ROK) and North Korea pit their ground forces of about
1.5 million against each other across the demilitarized zone (DMZ).

Maintaining peace and stability on the Korean Peninsula is vital for the peace and stability of the entire East

Asian region, to say nothing of Japan. (See Fig. I-2-2-1)

**1. North Korea**
North Korea has been advocating the construction of a “powerful and prosperous nation” as its basic national
policy, aiming to create a strong socialist state in all areas – ideology, politics, military affairs, and economy
– and it adopts “military-first politics” to realize this goal. The “military-first politics” has been defined as a
form of leadership that advances the great undertaking of socialism by resolving all problems that arise in the
revolution and national construction on the principle of military first and stressing the importance of the armed
forces as the pillar of the revolution[26]. Indeed, General Secretary of the Korean Workers’ Party Kim Jong Il is in a
position to completely control North Korea’s military forces as Chairman of the National Defense Commission[27]
and regularly visits military forces. It would appear that he intends to continue running the country by attaching
importance to, and relying on, the military forces.

Although North Korea faces serious economic difficulties to this day and depends on the international

community for food and other resources, the country seems to be maintaining and enhancing its military
capabilities and combat readiness by preferentially allocating resources to its military forces. For example,
military personnel represent a high proportion of the population, with active-service military personnel estimated
to account for nearly 5% of the overall population[28]. It is noteworthy that North Korea deploys most of its armed
forces along the DMZ. According to the official announcement made at the Supreme People’s Assembly in April
this year, the proportion of defense budget in this year’s national budget is 15.8%, but it is estimated that the
official defense budget represents only a portion of real defense expenditures.

Furthermore, North Korea seems to maintain and reinforce its so-called asymmetric military capabilities by

developing weapons of mass destruction (WMD) and ballistic missiles and by maintaining large-scale special
operation forces.

North Korea’s military behavior has increased tension over the Korean Peninsula, and constitutes a serious

destabilizing factor for the entire East Asian region, including Japan.

**1. WMD and Ballistic Missiles**
Concerning WMD, issues of North Korea’s nuclear weapons program have been pointed out, as well as its
chemical and biological weapons capabilities. In particular, North Korea’s nuclear issue has serious influence
on Japan’s national security and it is also a critical problem for the entire international community in terms of
non-proliferation of WMD[29].

As for ballistic missiles, North Korea seems to be conducting R&D to extend the range and to use solid fuel[30].

Also, it has been pointed out that North Korea is proliferating ballistic missiles. Combined with the nuclear issue,
North Korea’s missile issue is thus becoming a destabilizing factor not only for the Asia-Pacific region but also
for the entire international community, and there are strong concerns about the movement of the country.

Furthermore, following the launch of seven ballistic missiles on July 5, 2006, North Korea claimed to have

conducted a nuclear test on October 9 of the same year[31]. These series of acts by North Korea pose serious threats
to the peace and stability not only of Japan but also of East Asia and the international community, and have
evoked considerable debate in Japan.

**(1) Nuclear Weapons**
With regard to suspicions over North Korea’s development of nuclear weapons, the Agreed Framework[32 ]

signed between the United States and North Korea in 1994 once showed a roadmap to settle this issue through
dialogue.

However, in October 2002, the announcement by the United States that North Korea had acknowledged

the existence of a uranium-enrichment program for nuclear weapons raised concerns among the international
community over North Korea’s nuclear issue. In this situation, North Korea announced in December 2002 that it


-----

would resume operations at its nuclear-related facilities
in Yongbyon that had been frozen under the Agreed
Framework, and, at the end of February 2003, it was
confirmed that the operation of the graphite-moderated
nuclear reactor (5-MW nuclear reactor)[33] in Yongbyon
had been resumed. Subsequently, North Korea claimed
that it needed to maintain a “nuclear deterrent” and
indicated reprocessing of spent fuel rods[34] in April
2003, declared completion of the reprocessing of spent
fuel rods in October 2003, released the statement of
its Ministry of Foreign Affairs that North Korea had
already produced nuclear weapons in February 2005,
and announced completion of the extraction of 8,000
spent fuel rods from the restarted graphite-moderated
nuclear reactor in May 2005. Thus, North Korea has increased international tensions through its words and
actions.

Meanwhile, in pursuit of a peaceful solution to this problem and denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula,

Six-Party Talks[35] have been held since August 2003. At the fourth round of the Six-Party Talks in 2005, a joint
statement was adopted for the first time, which stated the verifiable abandonment of “all nuclear weapons and
existing nuclear programs” by North Korea. Subsequently, however, North Korea strongly reacted to the United
States’ designation of a bank in Macao dealing with North Korea as a “financial institution of primary money
laundering concern,” suspended its participation in the Six-Party Talks, and, in 2006, launched seven ballistic
missiles and announced that it had implemented a nuclear test. Against these actions by North Korea, which
further increased international tensions, the U.N. Security Council adopted Resolutions 1695 and 1718 imposing
sanctions on North Korea. In December 2006, North Korea finally returned to the fifth round of the Six-Party
Talks and, in February 2007, the parties reached an agreement on “Initial Actions for the Implementation of
the Joint Statement” to implement the joint statement made at the fourth round of the Six-Party Talks. After
the initial actions including shutting down of nuclear facilities in Yongbyon had been implemented, in October
2007, the “Second-phase Actions for the Implementation of the Joint Statement” were announced as the outcome
of the sixth round of the Talks. The agreement includes completion of the disablement of nuclear facilities in
Yongbyon and “a complete and correct declaration of all its (North Korea’s) nuclear programs” by the end of
2007. However, the implementation of the agreement has not been completed.

Regarding North Korea’s response to the nuclear issues described above, some people argue that it is resorting

to brinkmanship by intentionally heightening tension to receive compensation. Others argue that North Korea’s
ultimate objective is to possess nuclear weapons. Because the ultimate goal of North Korea is believed to be the
maintenance of its existing regime, it appears that the two foregoing views are not incompatible.

In light of the series of North Korea’s words as well as the fact that North Korea’s suspected development of

nuclear weapons is not yet elucidated, the possibility that North Korea has already made considerable progress
in its nuclear weapons program cannot be excluded[36]. In addition, it was concluded in 2006 that the probability
that North Korea had conducted a nuclear test was extremely high (See note 31). This implies that there is a
high possibility that the country has further advanced its nuclear weapons program. In general, downsizing of
a nuclear weapon enough to be loaded on a ballistic missile requires an extremely high degree of technological
capacity. However, considering the fact that the United States, the Soviet Union, the United Kingdom, France,
and China succeeded in acquiring such technology as early as the 1960s, it is difficult to eliminate the possibility
that North Korea, in a relatively short time, has realized downsizing of nuclear weapons and deployment of
nuclear warheads[37]. It is necessary to keep an eye on all related developments.


-----

**(2) Biological and Chemical Weapons**
Because North Korea is an extremely closed country and most materials, equipment, and technology used for
manufacturing biological and chemical weapons are for dual-use, which makes camouflage quite easy, details
of biological and chemical weapons developed or held by North Korea are not clear. However, it is believed
that North Korea has a certain level of production base for biological weapons although it ratified the Biological
Weapons Convention in 1987. As for chemical weapons, it is estimated that North Korea has several facilities
capable of producing chemical agents and has substantial stocks of such agents. It has not acceded to the Chemical
Weapons Convention[38].

**(3) Ballistic Missiles**
It is believed that, since the middle of the 1980s, North Korea has manufactured and deployed Scud B and Scud C[39],
a variant of Scud B with extended range, and has exported these missiles to Middle Eastern countries and others.
By the 1990s, North Korea allegedly began developing longer-range ballistic missiles, such as Nodong missiles.
It is highly probable that the ballistic missile that North Korea test-launched over the Sea of Japan in 1993 was a
Nodong missile. In 1998, North Korea launched a ballistic missile based on Taepodong-1 over Japan. Furthermore,
on July 5, 2006, completely lifting its freeze on the launch of ballistic missiles since 1999, North Korea fired
seven ballistic missiles. The third missile is assessed to have been Taepodong-2 and others to be Scud and Nodong
missiles. The launches of the Scud and Nodong missiles displayed more operational characteristics, which implies
that the operational capacity of North Korea’s ballistic missiles has been improved. (See Fig. I-2-2-2)

**Fig. I-2-2-2 Improvements in North Korea’s Ballistic Missile Operational Capabilities**

**Examples of the characteristics of the Scud and Nodong launches**
**in July 2006**

� Launches began before dawn
� Different types of ballistic missiles were launched in a row within a short period

of time

� Transporter-Erector-Launchers (TELs) were used
� Ballistic missiles with different ranges landed within a certain geographical area

Partly because North Korea is an extremely closed country, details of its ballistic missiles are still unclear.

It, however, appears that North Korea gives high priority to ballistic missiles in terms of enhancing its military
capabilities, political and diplomatic consideration, and earning foreign currency[40]. At present, the country is
believed to be developing a new intermediate-range ballistic missile and a new solid propellant short-range
ballistic missile[41] in addition to existing inventory of ballistic missiles. Also, it is necessary to pay attention to
the possibility that North Korea is improving existing Scuds and Nodongs, for example, to extend their ranges.
(See Fig. I-2-2-3)

It appears that Nodong, which is believed to have already been deployed, is a liquid propellant single-stage

ballistic missile. It is assessed to have a range of about 1,300km, and may reach almost all parts of Japan. Nodong
specifications have not been confirmed in detail, but, as it is believed to be based on the Scud technology, it
seems, for example, not to have the accuracy to carry out pinpoint attacks on specific target installations.

Because it is extremely difficult to verify the intention of North Korea’s military activities due to its closed

system, it is believed that underground military facilities have been constructed across the country, and Nodong,
as is the case with Scud, is thought to be loaded onto a transporter-erector-launcher (TEL) and operated with
mobility, it would be difficult to detect concrete signs of a Nodong launch in advance, such as its specific launch
site and timing.

Approx. 6,000km : Taepodong-2 range


Also, North Korea has been developing Taepodong-1 with an estimated range of at least 1,500km. The

Taepodong-1 missile is assumed to be a two-stage, liquid propellant ballistic missile with a Nodong as its first
stage and a Scud as its second stage. The missile launched in 1998 is assessed to be based on Taepodong-1. It
is surmised that North Korea was able to verify the performance of the technology concerning separation of a
multistage booster, altitude control, and thrust control through the launch. North Korea seems to have shifted
focus to the development of Taepodong-2 with a longer range: Taepodong-1 might have been a transitory product
to develop Taepodong-2.

In July 2006, North Korea launched a Taepodong-2 missile from the Taepodong district located in the

northeastern coastal area of the country. The missile is believed to be a two-stage missile with a new booster as
its first stage and a Nodong as its second stage, and with a range of approximately 6,000km. It seemed to fail in
mid-flight at a height of several kilometers after several tens of seconds without separating the first stage and fell
near the launch site. North Korea, however, would learn lessons from this failure and would continue to extend
the range of its ballistic missiles. It might even develop derivative missiles of Taepodong-2[42].

As the background of North Korea’s rapid strides in the development of its ballistic missiles with only a

few test launches, it is assumed that the country imported various materials and technologies from outside. It
is pointed out that North Korea transfers and proliferates ballistic missiles or related technologies including
the main body of Nodong and its related technologies to Iran and Pakistan, and that North Korea promotes the
development of missiles using funds procured by such transfer and proliferation[43]. In light of this, it is necessary
to monitor the transfer and proliferation of ballistic missiles by North Korea in addition to the development and
deployment of the missiles.


-----

**2. Military Posture**

**(1) General Situation**
North Korea has been building up its military capabilities in accordance
with the Four Military Guidelines (extensive training for all the soldiers,
modernizing all the armed forces, arming the entire population, and
fortifying the entire country)[44].

North Korea’s armed forces are comprised mainly of ground forces,

with total troop strength of roughly 1.1 million. North Korea is believed
to have been maintaining and enhancing its military capabilities and
operational readiness, and it seems to have continued infiltration
exercises[45]. However, most of its equipment is outdated.

Meanwhile, North Korea has large-scale special operations forces

that can conduct various operations ranging from intelligence gathering
and sabotage to guerrilla warfare. These forces are assessed to reach
approximately 100,000 personnel[46]. Moreover, North Korea seems
to have many underground military-related installations across the
country.

**(2) Military Capabilities**
The North Korean Army comprises about one million personnel, and roughly two-thirds of them are believed to
be deployed along the DMZ. The main body of the army is infantry, but the army also maintains armored and
artillery forces including at least 3,500 tanks. North Korea is believed to deploy long-range artillery along the
DMZ, such as 240mm multiple launch rockets and 170mm self-propelled guns, which can reach cities and bases
in the northern part of the ROK including the capital city of Seoul.

The navy has about 650 ships with total displacement of approximately 107,000 tons and is chiefly made of

small naval vessels such as high-speed missile crafts. Also, it has about 20 Romeo class submarines, about 60
midget submarines, and about 140 air cushioned landing crafts, the latter two of which are believed to be used
for infiltration and transportation of the special operation forces.

The Air Force has about 590 combat aircraft, most of which are out-of-date models made in China or the

former Soviet Union, but some fourth-generation aircraft such as MiG-29s and Su-25s are also included. North
Korea has a large number of outdated An-2s as well, which are believed to be used for transportation of special
operation forces.

North Korea continues to give various types of training to its forces to maintain and strengthen their

operational readiness. Meanwhile, given the serious food situation, the military forces seem to be engaged in
agricultural assistance as well.

**3. Domestic Affairs**
Some point out that in recent years North Korea’s regime is not as stable as in previous years due to loosening
of social control resulting from both an increasing disparity between the rich and the poor and a trend of moneyworshipping, and declining military morale. However, in view of the fact that national events[47] and diplomatic
negotiations have been held in an orderly manner, the regime based around Kim Jong II, Chairman of the National
Defense Commission, is considered to be still on the right track.

On the economic front, North Korea has been facing chronic economic stagnation and energy-food shortages

in recent years as a result of a number of factors including fragility of its socialistic planned economy and


-----

decreased economic cooperation with the former Soviet Union and East European countries following the end of
the Cold War. In particular, it seems that North Korea still has to rely on food assistance from foreign countries[48].
It is also pointed out that many North Koreans are starving and their sense of morale has declined.

In response to these various economic difficulties, North Korea has tried some limited but realistic reform

measures and changes in its economic management systems. It is believed that, since July 2002, North Korea has
raised wages and commodity prices and devaluated exchange rates[49]. However, as North Korea is not likely to
undertake a structural reform that could damage its current regime, the country would face various difficulties in
fundamentally improving its current economic situation.

**4. External Relations**
Although North Korea has made efforts to improve its external relations, its activities related to nuclear and
missile issues have raised international concerns.

The United States made it clear that it would make efforts to persuade North Korea to abandon its nuclear

program in close cooperation with other countries, aiming to resolve the issue through the Six-Party Talks. North
Korea has claimed that the denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula is the “dying wish” of Kim Il Sung and
promised to abandon “all nuclear weapons and existing nuclear programs.” North Korea, however, continues
to criticize various policies of the United States, insisting that the United States has yet to abandon its “hostile
policy” toward North Korea. Thus, there exists a significant gap between the two countries’ stances. In addition,
the United States has repeatedly expressed concerns over the possible proliferation of nuclear weapons and
nuclear-related materials, and the development, deployment, and proliferation of ballistic missiles by North
Korea.

Furthermore, the United States has pointed out the unresolved issue of Japanese abductees and North Korea’s

providing a haven to the hijackers of Yodo in the Country Reports on Terrorism[50]. At the same time, the United
States has designated North Korea as a state sponsor of terrorism[51].

While international concerns over North Korea have been increasing regarding nuclear and other issues,

North Korea and the ROK have continued talks, and economic and human exchanges, including the second NorthSouth Summit Meeting in October 2007 after seven years. On the military front, a defense ministerial meeting
was held in November 2007 and generals-level meetings were held on three occasions in 2007. The meetings
agreed on military safeguards related to passage, communications, and customs in the Kesong Industrial Zone.
Thus, some progress has been seen in military safeguard measures toward North-South cooperative projects.
However, following the inauguration of President Lee Myung Bak in the ROK, no further progress has been
made in North-South dialogue or exchange.

Concerning relations between North Korea and China, the “China-North Korea Treaty on Friendship,

Cooperation and Mutual Assistance” concluded in 1961 is still effective. Since China and the ROK established
diplomatic relations in 1992, North Korea’s relations with China have seen a change from the close relationship
they had enjoyed during the Cold War. Subsequently, however, the leaders of the two countries made mutual visits
and the relationship has improved again. Regarding North Korea’s nuclear issue, China has repeatedly expressed
its support for the denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula and has played an active role in resolving this issue
by, for example, acting as chairman of the Six-Party Talks and contributing to the conclusion of agreements.
Some, however, point out that the relationship between China and North Korea seems not to be as close as it
was.

Although relations between North Korea and Russia have become less close since the end of the Cold

War, some signs of improvement have been seen. The two countries signed the “Russia-North Korea Treaty on
Neighborly Friendship and Cooperation” in February 2000, which lacked articles on military alliance[52] unlike
the previous treaty. Subsequently, in July of the same year, then Russian President Vladimir Putin visited North


-----

Korea. In return, Kim Jong Il, Chairman of the National Defense Commission, visited Russia in 2001 and 2002.
Relations between North Korea and Russia have thus been strengthened in recent years.

Since 1999, North Korea has made an effort to establish relations with West European countries and others,

including establishment of diplomatic relations with European countries and participation in ARF ministerial
meetings. Meanwhile, the EU and ASEAN have traditionally expressed concerns over North Korea’s nuclear
and other issues.

In order to solve North Korea’s nuclear issue, it is important for Japan, the United States, and the ROK to

work together. At the same time, other nations such as China and Russia, which are also participants in the SixParty Talks, and international organizations including the United Nations and the IAEA, should play important
roles in this regard.

It is quite natural to prohibit North Korea from possessing nuclear weapons. However, we also have to pay

attention to other security concerns regarding North Korea: it is necessary to closely monitor military antagonism
on the Korean Peninsula and the development, deployment and proliferation of ballistic missiles by North
Korea.

Because North Korea is a closed country, it is difficult to verify the trends of its policies and activities. It is,

however, necessary to continue to pay close attention to such trends to understand the true intentions of North
Korea.

**2. The ROK**

**1. General Situation**
In the ROK, democracy has taken root through such means as the direct presidential election adopted by the 1987
amendment to the constitution. With regard to North Korea, the administration of President Lee Myung Bak,
inaugurated in February 2008, upholds a policy of “Vision 3000: Denuclearization and Openness,” which plans
to offer large-scale economic assistance to North Korea on the premise that the country will abandon its nuclear
program and open up its society.

U.S. forces, mainly the Army, have been stationed in the ROK since the ceasefire of the Korean War. The ROK

has established close security arrangements with the United States primarily based on the United States-Republic
of Korea Mutual Defense Treaty. In view of the progress in the North-South relations, improved national strength
of the ROK, and changes in the U.S. strategy, the two countries have been committed to solving the issues such
as realignment of the U.S. forces stationed in the ROK and transition of the operational control authority in
wartime[53] over ROK forces to the ROK. As for the realignment of U.S. forces in the ROK, the relocation of U.S.
forces Camp Yongsan located in the center of Seoul to the Pyongtek area in the south of Seoul and the relocation
of U.S. forces stationed in the northern side of Han Gang to the southern side of the river were agreed upon in
2003. It has, however, become difficult to complete the relocation to the Pyongtek area by the targeted deadline
of the end of 2008 primarily due to delayed purchase of land. As for the transition of the operational control
authority in wartime, the U.S. Secretary of Defense and the ROK Minister of National Defense agreed at their
meeting in February 2007 that the two sides would disestablish the U.S.-ROK Combined Forces Command and
complete the transition to the ROK on April 17, 2012. In talks between the leaders of the U.S. and ROK in April
2008, both countries agreed to develop the ROK-U.S. Alliance into a new strategic alliance conforming to the
21st century. It is necessary to monitor how the transition to a new “supporting-supported” command relationship
between the U.S. and ROK forces will be implemented.

To assist U.S.-led military operations in Afghanistan, the ROK had dispatched engineering and medical units,

but it put an end to the duty and withdrew these units in December 2007. Regarding the units dispatched to Iraq
in response to the request of the United States, the ROK continues the dispatch with the scale reduced to 650,


-----

approximately one-sixth of the initial size. The ROK, however, plans to complete the duties and withdraw by
the end of 2008.

Between the ROK and China, efforts have been made to promote military exchanges between the countries,

including mutual visits of naval vessels and air force planes. In April 2007, then ROK Minister of National Defense
Kim Jang Soo visited China and discussed with then Chinese Minister of National Defense Cao Gangchuan the
establishment of hotlines between the navies and air forces of the two countries. At the ROK-China summit
meeting held in May 2008, it was agreed for the two countries to upgrade the “all-around cooperative partnership”
to a “strategic cooperative partnership.” Their relations in the security area, however, remain primitive compared
with ones in the other areas, including the economic area.

Between the ROK and Russia, military exchanges have been made in recent years, including exchanges

between senior military officers and mutual visits of naval vessels, and the two countries have also concluded
agreements on cooperation in the areas of military technology, defense industry, and war materials. In February
2004, the navies of the two countries conducted joint search and rescue exercises for the first time, and, at the
ROK-Russia summit meeting held in September 2004, it reached a common understanding that the bilateral
relations had been shifted from a “constructive and mutually complementary partnership” to a “comprehensive
partnership of mutual trust.” In addition, the ROK has been importing tanks and armored vehicles from Russia
since 1995 as a part of redemption of debt.

**2. Military Affairs**

**(1) Defense Policies**
The ROK has a defensive weakness in that its capital Seoul, where a quarter of the country’s population is
concentrated, is situated close to the DMZ.

The ROK has set the defense objectives as follows: “defending the nation from external military threats and

invasion, upholding the peaceful unification, and contributing to regional stability and world peace.” As one of
the “external military threats,” the ROK had designated North Korea as its “main enemy,” but, since the Defense
White Paper 2004, North Korea has no longer been described as such[54].

The ROK intends to promote “National Defense Reform 2020” to satisfy its defense needs such as

maintenance of its military capabilities in line with the development of information and scientific technologies,
balanced development of its Army, Navy, and Air Forces, elimination of inefficiency, and build-up of barrack
culture in accordance with social trends. The reform program is based on the following ideas and the bill on the
National Defense Reform incorporating the main ideas was enacted in December 2006.
1) Expansion of civilian base for national defense: Establish the structure in which civilians play the central role

in deciding and implementing defense policies and the military forces focus on executing combat missions.
2) Build-up of military structure and system of the forces in conformity with characteristics of modern wars:

Enhance its war potential by such means as modernizing equipment while reducing the size of the standing
forces, mainly the army, from 680,000 personnel to the level of 500,000 personnel and that of reserved troops
from 3 million personnel to the appropriate level in line with the reduced size of the standing forces.
3) Reorganization of the national defense management system into a low cost and highly efficient system: Improve

the organization and system to ensure transparency of procurement service and expertise, and strengthen
infrastructure for computerization, and promote outsourcing in the areas of logistic support.
4) Improvement of barrack culture in accordance with trends of the time: Take measures to improve environment

of military personnel’s service and establish the system to prevent accidents.


-----

**(2) Trends in Defense Build-up**
As for the ROK military capacity, the ground forces consist of 22 army divisions and two marine divisions, totaling
590,000 personnel; the naval forces consist of about 180 vessels with a total displacement of approximately
153,000 tons; and the air forces (Air Force and Navy together) of approximately 610 combat aircraft.

In recent years, the ROK has been trying to modernize its Navy and Air Force with the introduction of

submarines, large transportation ships[55], multi-role helicopters, and F-15Ks. Also, the ROK plans to procure four
Airborne Warning and Control Systems (AWACS) by 2012. The ROK is introducing domestically manufactured
destroyers (KDX-IIs and KDX-IIIs) and a KDX-III (an Aegis-equipped destroyer) is expected to be put into
service in 2008. In addition, the ROK is believed to be promoting domestic production of missiles.

The 2008 defense budget amounts to approximately 26,650 billion won, approximately 8.8% over that of the

previous fiscal year. (See Fig. I-2-2-4)

**3. U.S. Forces Stationed in the ROK**
Combined with the ROK’s own defense efforts, U.S. forces stationed in the country play a vital role in preserving
the military balance on the Korean Peninsula and providing a deterrent against large-scale armed conflicts on
the peninsula.

The United States has been changing the posture of its forces stationed in the ROK based on the agreement in

June 2003 to reposition them to the southern side of Han Gang in two stages and the agreement in October 2004
to reduce the number of its stationed military personnel, approximately 37,500, by 12,500. As for the personnel
reduction, at the U.S.-ROK leaders’ meeting in April 2008, it was agreed to retain the current level of 28,500
personnel as an appropriate size. In the course of these changes, the United States has invested in modernization
of the U.S. forces stationed in the ROK and made efforts to maintain and strengthen the deterrence capabilities
of U.S.-ROK allied forces based on the United States-Republic of Korea Mutual Defense Treaty. (See Fig.
I-2-2-5)


-----

The United States and the ROK have engaged in joint exercises

in order to increase their combined defense capabilities in dealing
with contingencies on the Korean Peninsula. Among these is the
“Foal Eagle” exercise, a large-scale joint logistics support field
exercise, which was staged in March 2008 concurrently with the
“Key Resolve” joint wartime reinforcing exercise[56].

Section 3. China

**1. General Situation**

**1. General Situation**
China has the world’s largest population and a vast landmass surrounded by 14 countries. It has long borderlines
and a long coastline facing the Pacific Ocean. China is also a nation with various races, religions, and languages.
Most of its ethnic minorities populate the borderlands often with the same ethnic groups living across the borders.
China, with a long history, has been shaping and maintaining a distinct culture and civilization, and pride of its
unique history and the experiences of semi-colonization after the 19th century is driving a desire for a strong
nation as well as fueling their nationalism. China is a state with a socialist regime, and aims at building a modern
socialist state under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party.

In recent years, China has significantly increased its international trade, continued to attract much overseas

investment, and the economy is persistently and dramatically growing. However, China faces various domestic
hurdles including the great political problem of corruption within central and local communist party leadership.
Furthermore, as a result of rapid economic growth, issues such as wealth gaps among urban residents and
environmental pollution are emerging, in addition to a widening urban-rural and coastal-inland disparity.
Moreover, issues in the future associated with the rapid aging of the population are forecasted to arise. China
also has ethnic minority issues, such as the March 2008 clash between minorities and the authorities in the
Tibet Autonomous Region that stemmed from minority
protests. International attention is paid to China’s
domestic situation due to the earthquake in May 2008,
which caused immense damage mainly in the Sichuan
Province and the Beijing Olympics in August. Under
the guiding principle of the “Scientific Outlook on
Development,” the Hu Jintao administration aims to
build a “Harmonious Society” as its fundamental policy
and is committed to giving priority to the solution of the
aforementioned domestic problems[57]. China also aims
to improve its current economic structure, where it is
dependent on exports abroad and foreign investment
creating a dearth of domestic demand, in order to
maintain stable economic growth.

On the diplomatic field, it is believed that China

is aiming to secure its necessary interests for economic development in order to maintain national stability.
These interests include stability in a strategic international environment by sustaining favorable relations with
major powers such as the U.S. and Russia, maintaining favorable relations with neighboring countries and stable
situations in those countries, and energy supply.

On the military front, China has been modernizing its military capabilities, backed up by the high and

constant increase in defense budget. China gives priority to the Taiwan issue as an issue of national sovereignty
and territorial integrity, and for the time being it will probably aim for the modernization of military capabilities
to acquire the capability to prevent some movements including the independence of Taiwan. The military trends
of China draw attention from countries in the region, as the country has been steadily growing as a political and
economic power in the region.


-----

**2. Relations with Taiwan**
China holds the principle that Taiwan is a part of China, and that the Taiwan issue is therefore a domestic issue.
The country maintains that the “one-China” principle is the underlying premise and foundation for discussions
between China and Taiwan. China also claims that it would never abandon efforts for peaceful unification,
expressing that it will take policy and measures to solve issues of Taiwanese interest and protect their due
authority, while it has also repeatedly stated that it has not renounced the use of force from the standpoint of
strong opposition to any intervention in the unification of China by foreign powers as well as any move toward
independence. The Anti-Secession Law, enacted in March 2005, provides that China will not renounce the use
of force, stating that China will employ non-peaceful means if a
serious situation occurs which would lead to Taiwan’s separation
from China.

Chen Shui-bian, who was inaugurated as president (Democratic

Progressive Party) of Taiwan in 2000, took actions strongly
oriented to the Taiwanese independence, such as the Campaign
for Rectifying the Name of Taiwan, which changed the names
of various groups and other entities to “Taiwan,” and advocacy
of a national referendum for U.N. participation under the name
“Taiwan.” This incited sharp reaction by China. In comparison,
Ma Ying-jeou, who was elected as president (Kuomintang) in
March 2008, advocates a policy of pursuing Taiwanese economic
development through economic exchange with China and the
status quo rather than independence. In May 2008, President Hu
Jintao visited Beijing for a meeting with KMT Chairman Wu Pohsuing, and the two parties agreed on a prompt re-commencement
of the dialogue concerning China and Taiwan, and the trends in
future China-Taiwan relations will attract attention.

**3. Relations with the United States**
There are various outstanding problems between the United States and China, such as human rights issues in
China, proliferation of weapons of mass destruction, the Taiwan issue, and trade issues. Also, China appears to
be wary of the U.S. inclination towards “unipolarization.” However, since a stable U.S.-China relationship is
essential for China in building its economy, it is believed that China will wish to maintain that relationship.

The United States believes that international peace and stability and the expansion of free and fair trade are

beneficial for China as well as for other countries in the international society, and thus China has a responsibility
to support these common interests in cooperation with the United States and other major powers in the world.
Based on this recognition, the United States makes it an objective of its policy towards China that China will
continue to be its economic partner and become a “responsible stakeholder[58].” At the same time, the United States
recognizes that China is facing a strategic crossroads and has the greatest potential in the long run to compete
militarily with the United States and build disruptive military technologies that could offset U.S. military
advantages. Accordingly, the United States is urging China to become a constructive partner in the international
community, while recognizing it necessary to hedge against the case that such effort would fail[59].

In response, Chinese President Hu Jintao stated on his visit to the United States in April 2006 that China

shared strategic interests with the United States in a wide range of areas, and that the country would promote a
constructive and cooperative relationship with the United States. China is thus showing an attitude of attributing
importance to a stable China-U.S. relationship.


-----

Military exchanges have also been promoted between China and the United States. The countries conduct

various policy-related dialogue, and China dispatched an observer to a U.S. military exercise (U.S. Pacific
Command exercise “Valiant Shield”) for the first time in June 2006. Moreover, joint exercises have been
conducted between the Chinese and United States navies on mutual port visits by naval vessels since September
2006.

The United States is concerned that the lack of transparency of the Chinese military increases the possibility of

misunderstanding and miscalculation and endangers stability[60]. The U.S. refers to improve mutual understanding
with China and to prevent conflict by communicating U.S. resolve to maintain deterrence and stability in the
Asia-Pacific region[61] as goals in U.S.-China military exchange.

**4. Relations with Russia**
Since 1989 when China-Soviet confrontation ended, both countries have continuously maintained a stance of
placing importance on their bilateral relationship. Deepening the “strategic partnership” between China and
Russia, which was established in the middle of the 1990s, has been emphasized through regular exchanges of
visits by their leaders. In 2001, the China-Russia Treaty of Good-Neighborliness and Friendly Cooperation[62]
was concluded. Subsequently in 2004, the long-standing issue of border demarcation between the two countries,
which once evolved into a military clash, came to a settlement.

The two countries share a common awareness that they will promote world multi-polarization and the

building of a new international order. In addition, economic motives have driven the good relationship between
them in recent years.

On the military front, since the 1990s, China has purchased modern weapons from Russia, including Su
27 and Su-30 fighter aircraft, Sovremenny-class destroyers, and Kilo-class submarines. Russia is currently the
largest supplier of weapons to China; however, some point out that trade amounts have been on the decline
in recent years due to the advancement of indigenous weapon production in China. Some also point out that
Russia, which shares a land border with China, has noted that it has policy that prevents the supply of certain
sophisticated weapons to China that would cause a threat to Russia itself.

China-Russia military exchanges include regular visits by the highest-ranking defense officials. Also, the two

countries have held a joint military exercise. They conducted their first joint exercise mainly on the Shandong
Peninsula in China in August 2005. In August 2007, a joint exercise consisting of anti-terrorism operations was
conducted in the Lanzhou Military Region in China and in the Volga-Ural Military District in Russia by the
member states of the Shanghai Cooperation Organization (SCO)[63]. In September 2007, a unit of the Chinese
People’s Armed Police Force visited Russia to participate in “Cooperation 2007,” a China-Russia anti-terrorism
exercise conducted in Moscow. Through these joint military exercises with Russia, it is believed that China
can deepen mutual understanding and build confidence between the two forces, show the presence of China
and Russia as one pole in a multi-polar world, and learn operational methods of Russian weapons and military
operational doctrines.

**5. Relations with North Korea**
China regards relations with North Korea as “traditional friendship,” and North Korea seems to heavily rely
on China for a great portion of its food assistance and energy supply. Accordingly, China is believed to have a
stronger influence on North Korea than other countries do[64]. China supported U.N. Security Council Resolution
1695, which condemned the launch of ballistic missiles by North Korea in 2006 and Resolution 1718, which
imposed sanctions on North Korea in relation to the country’s nuclear tests. In addition, China has played an
active role serving as the chairman of the Six-Party Talks that have been held in Beijing since 2003, and the
international community expects that China will continue proactive efforts towards resolving the nuclear issue.


-----

**6. Relations with Other Countries**

**(1) Relations with Southeast Asian Countries**
As for its relations with countries in Southeast Asia, China has been developing bilateral relations with all the
countries in the region through active mutual top-level visits and other means[65]. China is also actively involved
in multilateral frameworks such as ASEAN plus 1 (China), ASEAN plus 3, and the ARF (ASEAN Regional
Forum). Through these diplomatic forums, the country is deepening economic and cultural cooperation with
ASEAN countries while, recently, also proactively advancing cooperation in the security sector.

In addition, China also strengthens relationships via military aid, such as providing army engineering

equipment to the Philippines and patrol boats to Cambodia.

**(2) Relations with Central Asian Countries**
The Xinjiang Uyghur Autonomous Region, a western province in China, is situated next to Central Asia. It
directly shares borders with the three countries of Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, and Tajikistan, and has ethnic
minorities settled in the areas straddling borders. Naturally, the region hosts lively exchanges between the people
of those countries. Thus China is greatly concerned about the political stability and security situations in Central
Asian states, which might be influenced by terrorism caused by Islamic extremists and other factors. Chinese
engagement in the Shanghai Cooperation Organization (SCO), which was established in June 2001, is viewed as
an indication of such concerns held by China. (See Fig. I-2-3-1)

**(3) Relations with South Asian Countries**
China has continued a hostile relationship with India due to issues such as border conflict. However, it has
traditionally maintained a favorable relationship with Pakistan, which has a hostile relationship with India as
well. The relationship extends to cooperation in the military sector, such as the export of weapons and transfer of
military technologies. On the other hand, in recent years China has been committed to improving its relationship
with India while also paying consideration to maintaining balance with Pakistan. Through active mutual visits by
leaders, China regards relations with India as a strategic partnership and states that the issue of border demarcation
between the two countries, which once culminated in military clashes, is also progressing. It is believed that the
development of relations with India can be attributed to the stance of placing importance on Chinese and Indian
economic growth as well as response to the move in the strengthening of U.S.-India relations.


-----

Regarding military exchanges, China has conducted joint naval search and rescue exercises with Pakistan

and India since 2003. In December 2007, “Hand-in-Hand 2007,” the first anti-terrorism joint exercise since the
1962 China-India border conflict, was conducted between both countries’ army in China’s Yunnan Province.

**(4) Relations with EU Countries**
Trade between China and EU countries has grown remarkably in recent years. For China, the EU is now as
important as Japan and the United States as a partner, especially in the economic sector. China, through these
diplomatic opportunities, strongly demands EU countries to lift their arms embargo against the country, which
has been imposed on China since the Tiananmen Square incident that took place in 1989. Although some EU
countries voiced their readiness for the lifting, Japan has expressed its objection to it.

Regarding information and communications technology, avionics equipment, and air-independent propulsion

systems for submarines, EU member countries possess more advanced technologies than that of China or Russia,
which exports weapons to China. Therefore, if the EU weapons embargo on China was lifted, it is possible that
the weapons and military technologies of EU countries would transfer to China, and that said technologies would
be utilized as a bargaining chip in gaining the edge in weapons transactions with Russia. It is necessary to pay
attention to future discussions made within the EU about the arms embargo on China.

**7. Overseas Activities**
China states that it will consistently support and actively participate in U.N. peacekeeping operations, and
according to the “China’s National Defense in 2006” white paper, the country has sent a total of 5,915 military
personnel to participate in U.N. peacekeeping operations and eight lost their lives in these operations. According
to the United Nations, as of May 2008, China has dispatched a total of 1,977 personnel, police officers, and
military observers to 12 U.N. peacekeeping operations, including the United Nations Mission in Liberia (UNMIL)
and the United Nations Mission in Sudan (UNMIS), thus showing its presence in these operations to a certain
degree. China’s proactive approach to U.N. peacekeeping operations appears to be attributed to their aim to
strengthen relations with the region that the PKOs are being conducted in, particularly in regards to relations with
various African nations. In addition, China is engaged in international disaster relief operations. For example,
the Chinese military personnel participated in international assistance to conduct relief activities in the area
devastated by the tsunami in the Indian Ocean at the end of 2004. (See Fig. I-2-3-2)

**8. International Transfer of Weapons**
China has provided developing countries in Asia and Africa with weapons such as small arms, tanks, and aircraft,
and it is reported that the main recipients are Iran, Pakistan, Bangladesh, Thailand, and Myanmar while weapons
are also being exported to African countries such as the Democratic Republic of Congo, Namibia, and Zimbabwe.
It has been pointed out that China is supplying weapons to countries that have problems in terms of democracy
and human rights, and attention will be paid to whether China will improve the transparency of international
weapons transfer in response to the concerns of the international community.

**2. Military Affairs**

**1. General Situation**
China, as its basic objectives and obligations for national security, declares to defend its national sovereignty,
territorial integrity, and maritime rights and interests, to further develop its economy and society, and to
continuously strengthen its comprehensive national power. In order to achieve these objectives and obligations,
the country is committed to balanced economic and defense construction.

The adoption of the “four modernizations line”—a decision to promote the modernization of agriculture,

industry, national defense, and science and technology made at the Third Plenary Session of the 11th Central
Committee of the Communist Party of China held in 1978—triggered and has been promoting the modernization
of military power under the broad concept of prioritizing the country’s economic development and then returning
the successful results to the military sector.


-----

The initial impetus for China’s modernization of military power is believed to be the fact that the military

technical level was comparatively behind that of other countries. From the 1990s onward, China has aggressively
promoted the “Revolution in Military Affairs with Chinese Characteristics,” which mainly consists of furthering
military technology and informatization, based on its military strategy[66] to win the informatized war in order to
cope with global trends in military developments, including those observed in the Gulf War, the Kosovo conflict,
and the Iraq War. Backed by the stable relations with bordering countries such as Russia, China is believed to
give the top priority to handling of the Taiwan issue, more specifically to acquiring the capability to hinder the
independence of Taiwan and foreign military support for Taiwan[67].

As regards a more long-term objective for China’s military modernization, China pursues a three-step

development strategy in modernizing its national defense and armed forces, in accordance with the state’s overall
plan to realize modernization. The first step is to lay a solid foundation by 2010, the second is to make major
progress around 2020, and the third step is to basically reach the strategic goal of building informatized armed
forces and being capable of winning informatized wars by mid-21st century[68].” In the long term, China appears
to be aiming to develop a military force alongside improving national strength, as this is compliant with the
development plan for the overall country[69].

China has reduced the number of its military personnel, mainly in the army and has been modernizing

equipment of its entire armed forces, especially its naval and air forces, and nuclear and missile capabilities. In
addition, China is working to improve joint operational capabilities among services and arms, conduct practical
exercises, cultivate and acquire highly-capable human resources for administering operations of a technologically
advanced and informatized force, and to improve the foundation of the domestic defense industry. Much of the
equipment used by the People’s Liberation Army is still outdated, and the current military modernization efforts
are believed to be undertakings that will thoroughly improve the military’s capabilities. Nevertheless, China
does not show a clear, specific future vision. From this perspective, there is concern about how China’s military
strength will impact the regional situation and Japanese security which is to be carefully analyzed.

**2. Military Transparency**
Historically, China has not disclosed information on its possession of specific equipment, procurement objectives
or past procurements, the organization and deployment of major units, records of main military operations and
exercises, or the detailed breakdowns of the national defense budget.

China released a white paper on defense titled “China’s National Defense in 1998,” which has since been

published every two years. In December 2006, China published “China’s National Defense in 2006,” and the
nation also conducts a lot of dialogue with the national defense authorities of other countries[70]. (See Part III,
Chapter 2, Section 2-2)

Furthermore, in August 2008, China expressed its will to return to the United Nations Register of

Conventional Arms and its participation in the United Nations Instrument for Reporting Military Expenditures,
and has submitted an annual report based on each system. China has continuously published compiled documents
on its national security while reintegrating itself into and commencing participation in U.N. systems regarding
armaments and military expenditures. This can be assessed as a contribution to improve transparency concerning
its military capabilities. However, it needs to be pointed out that the five white papers published in the past
have not substantially improved transparency. For example, as for detailed breakdowns of the national defense
spending, the papers merely announced the total amount and general purposes for the three categories: personnel
living expenses, maintenance costs for operations, and equipment expenditures. Moreover, in regards to the
report for the United Nations Instrument for Reporting Military Expenditures submitted by China in 2007, details
of military expenditure breakdowns were not filled out in the standard format that is used by Japan and many
other nations, and it served as merely a brief report with details that were nearly the same as those in the China’s


-----

National Defense white paper.

Details have yet to be disclosed regarding the cause of the breach of international law in November 2004

where a Chinese nuclear-powered submarine submerged in Japanese territorial waters. Moreover, in January
2007, when China conducted an anti-satellite weapon test, Japan expressed concerns in relation to the safe use of
space and national security, and demanded China give explanations about the test and the country’s intentions.
The Chinese government, however, did not give sufficient explanations about the details and intention of the
test to allay Japan’s concerns. In addition, in November 2007, China sent notification indicating the refusal for
U.S. naval vessels such as the aircraft carrier Kitty Hawk to pull into Hong Kong on the expected day of arrival,
but then later revised their notice allowing the vessels to port. However, the U.S. naval vessels had already
abandoned their attempt to port and changed course. These incidents incite concern over the decision-making
and behavior of China’s military.

China is steadily growing into a political and economic power in the region, and has become a presence that

attracts attention in the military sector as well from other countries in the region. In order to cast aside concerns
over China, it is becoming more and more important for China itself to improve transparency of its national
defense policy and military. It is desired that China will increase transparency in its military capabilities through
various opportunities in the future.

**3. National Defense Budget**
China announced that its national defense budget for FY 2008 would be approximately 409.9 billion yuan, up
17.7% from the previous year. Thus China’s official defense budget recorded a growth rate of over 10% for 20
consecutive years in terms of the initial defense budget. This pace of increase in official defense expenditures
means that the defense budget increases two-fold every five years, and that the size of the official national
defense budget of China has nominally grown 19 times in the last 20 years[71]. China’s National Defense in
2006 explains that the relationship between national defense and economy shall be “guided by the principle of
coordinated development of national defense and the economy,“ and thus the country regards the build-up of
defense capabilities as a task that is as important as economic construction. Accordingly, it is believed that China
will continue to input resources for the improvement of its national defense capabilities to the extent that it will
not hamper its economic construction. It is therefore thought that the country’s military capabilities will continue
to be modernized. (See Fig. I-2-3-3)

Note: The total defense budgets for FY 2002 and FY 2004 were not disclosed, and there is a discrepancy when we apply the

disclosed growth rates and amounts of increase to the initial budgets of FY 2001 and FY 2003. This graph uses 168.4
billion yuan and 210 billion yuan for FY 2002 and FY 2004, respectively. These are calculated on the assumption that the
disclosed growth rates and amounts of increase are based on the actual defense expenses for FY 2001 and FY 2003.


-----

In addition, it must be noted that the amount of the defense budget announced by China is considered to be

only part of its actual military expenditures[72]. For example, it is believed that not all of the equipment procurement
costs and research and development expenses are included in the official figures for defense expenditures.

**4. Military Posture**
China’s military forces are composed of the People’s Liberation Army (PLA), the People’s Armed Police Force[73],
and the militia[74], and these bodies are believed to be instructed and led by the Central Military Commission[75]. The
PLA, a people’s army created and led by the Chinese Communist Party, consists of the Army, Navy, Air Force,
and the Second Artillery Corps. (See Fig. I-2-3-4)

**(1) Nuclear Capabilities and Ballistic Missile Forces**
China has continued independent efforts to develop nuclear capabilities and ballistic missile forces since the
middle of the 1950s, seemingly with a view to ensuring deterrence, supplementing its conventional forces, and
maintaining its voice in the international community.

China possesses various types and ranges of intercontinental ballistic missiles (ICBM), submarine-launched

ballistic missiles (SLBM), intermediate range ballistic missiles/medium range ballistic missiles (IRBM/MRBM),
and short range ballistic missiles (SRBM). The survivability and readiness of China’s missile forces is under
improvement by updating liquid propellant type to a solid propellant one. Moreover, it also appears that China
is working to increase performance, such as by extending ranges, improving precision of fire, and switching to
MIRV[76].

China possesses approximately 30 ICBMs, which are strategic nuclear weapons, and the majority of those

have been fixed-type missiles with liquid fuel propellant systems. In general, this type of missile requires time
to inject liquid fuel immediately before launching, thus signs of launching can be detected beforehand and may
invite preemptive attack. For this reason, China has developed the DF-31 series, which is a new mobile-type
ICBM with a solid fuel propellant system that are mounted onto a transporter-erector-launcher (TEL), as well
as the DF-31A, the extended model of the DF-31, and it appears that the missiles have already been deployed.
Regarding SLBMs, until now, China had only possessed medium range JL-1 missiles along with one nuclear
powered ballistic missile submarine (SSBN) equipped with these missiles; however, the country currently appears
to be developing the JL-2, a new SLBM with a range of approximately 8,000km, and constructing a Jin-class
SSBN to carry the missiles. Now that the DF-31 and DF-31A have been deployed, once the JL-2 reaches a level
of practical use, it is believed that China’s strategic nuclear capabilities will improve by a great margin.

As for the IBRM/MRBM covering the Asia-Pacific region including Japan, China has traditionally deployed

liquid fuel propellant DF-3 and DF-4 missiles.
Currently, however, the country has also deployed
the DF-21, which can be transported and operated by
being mounted on a TEL. These missiles are capable
of carrying nuclear warheads. It is believed that China
is currently developing conventional warheads for antiship ballistic missiles based on the DF-21 that could
be used to attack ships at sea, such as aircraft carriers.
China also appears to be developing the DH-10, a
cruise missile with a range of 2,000km. Once available
for practical use, those missiles might complement
ballistic missile forces, covering the Asia-Pacific region
including Japan. In addition to IBRM/MRBM, China


-----

also possesses over 100 medium range H-6 (Tu-16) bombers that are capable of equipping nuclear warheads.

Concerning the short-range ballistic missiles (SRBM) as strike capability on Taiwan[77], China also possesses

DF-15 and DF-11, and those numbers appear to be increasing yearly. (See Fig. I-2-3-5)

**(2) Ground Forces**
The size of the Chinese ground forces is the largest in the world with approximately 1.6 million personnel. Since
1985, China has continuously sought to modernize its armed forces by curtailing personnel and streamlining
organizations and systems in order to improve efficiency. The country aims to develop highly capable military
forces, while reducing units inferior in equipment and technologies. More specifically, China is improving
military mobility by such measures as switching from its past regional defense model to a complete national
mobile model[78], working to supply its infantry with automobiles, and promoting mechanization. In addition,
China is believed to be strengthening its airborne troops and special operations forces. The country is also
working on a reform to improve its logistical support capabilities.

**(3) Naval Forces**
The naval forces consist of three fleets—the North Sea, East Sea, and South Sea Fleets. The Chinese Navy has
approximately 860 ships (including approximately 60 submarines), with a total displacement of approximately
1.17 million tons. The navy is in charge of the maritime national defense and protecting the sovereignty of
territorial waters and maritime rights and interests. The Chinese Navy introduced modern Kilo-class submarines
from Russia and actively constructed new types of domestic submarines to enhance its submarine capabilities.
Additionally, the country is promoting the introduction of combatant ships with improved air defense and antiship missile capabilities, and is strengthening the capabilities of landing ships and supply ships. In view of how


-----

the navy is being modernized, it is believed that China is trying to build capabilities to perform operations at long
ranges from China’s shore. Also, China seems to have a strong interest in the possession of aircraft carriers, and
it is believed that China is currently conducting research and development on technologies in order to possess
aircraft carriers in the future[79].

**(4) Air Forces**
The Chinese Air Force and Navy have approximately 2,820 combat aircraft in total. The number of fourthgeneration modern fighters is rising sharply. China mass produces J-10 fighters domestically and is promoting
the import and licensed production of Su-27 fighters as well as the import of Su-30 fighters equipped with
anti-surface and anti-ship attack capabilities from Russia. China imports highly sophisticated extended-range
surface-to-air missiles from Russia in order to improve air defense capabilities. In addition to the introduction
of modern fighters, China is making continuous efforts to acquire in-flight refueling capabilities and an early
warning and control system, which are essential for the operation of modern air forces. Furthermore, it is reported
that China plans to import a great number of large cargo aircraft from Russia. In view of the way that the Air
Force is being modernized, China seems to aim at building air capability such as air-to-surface and air-to-ship
attack capabilities in further forward areas, in addition to improving its air defense capabilities[80].

China has also begun to enhance the electronic

warfare and intelligence gathering capabilities of its
aircrafts in addition to actual reconnaissance flights
against surrounding countries. In recent years in
particular, there have been Chinese air activities that
appear to be some form of information gathering against
Japan. Also, in September 2007, H-6 medium-range
bombers flew into the Japanese air defense identification
zone over the East China Sea to advance near to the
Japan-China median line. Further attention needs to be
paid to these activities conducted by Chinese air forces H-6 bomber flying over the East China Sea
in the area surrounding Japan.

**(5) Military Use of Space and Cyber Warfare Capabilities**
China continues to put forth efforts for space development. The country has launched various satellites into
space using indigenously produced rockets, successfully conducted manned space flights, and launched a lunar
orbiter. As it appears that in China’s space development military and non-military sectors are related[81], there is
the possibility that China utilizes space for such military purposes as information gathering, communications,
and navigation.

China is developing anti-satellite weapons, and the country tested the destruction of its own satellite in

January 2007 where ballistic missile technology was applied. It has also been pointed out that China is developing
a system that uses lasers to hamper the functions of satellites.

China appears to have interest in the cyber warfare and they seem to have organized and are currently training

a cyber warfare-specialized unit[82].

China’s interest in anti-satellite weapons and cyber warfare can be attributed to the increasing reliance of

information gathering and command and communication in the military sector, which are vital for swift and
efficient exercise of military strength, on satellites and computer networks.


-----

**5. Education and Training**
In recent years, the PLA has been conducting practical exercises in order to advance its operational modernization,
as well as large-scale exercises, including cooperative exercises of the Army, Navy, and Air Force and landing
exercises. In 2002, the PLA enforced the Outline of Military Training and Evaluation as a revision to the previous
training doctrine in order to reform exercises based on science and technology and constantly promote new
forms of exercises. Furthermore, the national military training conference held in 2006 emphasized promoting
a shift from military training under the conditions of mechanization to military training under the conditions
of informatization. In these years, the military training focuses that are indicated by the PLA’s General Staff
Department each year have emphasized joint exercises by multiple services, match-type exercises, exercises in
complex electromagnetic environments such as for electronic jamming, and improving exercise evaluations.

In addition, in the education spectrum, the PLA aims to develop military personnel versed in science and

technology. In 2003, a human resources strategy project
was launched to develop human resources capable of
directing an informatized operation and of building
informatized armed forces. The project has a goal of
achieving a big leap in the development of military
personnel to 2020. In these years, the PLA appears to
be increasing its wage standards, and this is believed
to be due to their objective of securing highly-capable
human resources. Moreover, since 2000, in order to
secure highly-capable and highly-educated people,
the military has implemented a system where civilian
college students are provided with scholarships and
then allowed to enter the military as commissioned
officers after graduation.

**6. National Defense Industry Sector**
China imports highly sophisticated equipment and parts that it cannot produce domestically from other countries
such as Russia. However, China is believed to now place emphasis on indigenous production of military equipment
as the country manufactures much of its equipment domestically and is now also actively making research and
development efforts on new equipment. China’s national defense industry sector appears to be developing due to
its own efforts, an improvement of private industry infrastructure accompanying economic growth, use of dual
military-civilian technologies, and the absorption of foreign technologies. The sector is working as a base for the
modernization of China’s military.

Favorable growth in the Chinese defense industry was once hindered by inefficiency caused by excessive

secrecy and other factors; however, in recent years, reform of the defense industry has been progressed. In
particular, the emphasis has been placed on two-way technological exchanges where military technologies are
utilized for building the national economy, and in turn civilian technologies are absorbed for a build-up of
national defense. Specifically, China states that technologies of the defense industry have contributed to the
development of civilian space exploration, the aviation industry, and the ship building industry. Furthermore,
China maintains that it encourages and supports international cooperation and competition in dual-use industries,
thus appearing to have interest in absorbing foreign technologies through dual-use industries.

**7. Maritime Activities**
In regards to activity in waters near Japan in recent years, in November 2004, a submerged Chinese nuclear

-----

powered submarine intruded into Japan’s territorial waters, violating international law. Including this incident,
Chinese naval vessels have been observed conducting what appeared to be exercises and information gathering
activities. Other naval vessels as well as Chinese government-owned ships were also observed engaging in
apparent oceanographic research within the exclusive economic zone of Japan. Furthermore, China has been
exploring and developing oil gas fields such as Shirakaba (Chunxiao in Chinese), whose contract mining field
and the structure extend to the eastern side of the intermediate line between Japan and China. In September
2005, Chinese naval vessels were seen navigating near these oil and gas fields[83 84]. In October 2006, a Chinese
Song-class submarine surfaced in the vicinity of the USS Kitty Hawk aircraft carrier in international waters
reportedly near Okinawa. The foreign submarine’s approach to a U.S. aircraft carrier is a noteworthy military
incident in the military context[85].

Moreover, the Chinese navy has begun vessel exercises overseas, including joint exercises with Pakistan,

India, and Thailand in November 2005, its first joint exercise with the U.S. Navy in 2006, and its first participation
in a multilateral joint exercise in March 2007, a counterterrorism multilateral joint maritime exercise conducted in
Pakistan. Chinese naval vessels also visited Singapore in May 2007, dispatched to multilateral maritime exercises
for the first time at the Second Western Pacific Naval Symposium (WPNS). In September 2007, deep-sea vessel
units visited Russia, the United Kingdom, Spain, and France to conduct joint search and rescue exercises and
other activities.

In this way, China has been intensifying its maritime activities in recent years. In addition to activities in

Japanese waters, China is enhancing its bases for activities in the Spratly and Paracel islands, over which it has
territorial disputes with countries including some ASEAN members. Seemingly China is interested in the Indian
Ocean area, which provides a shipping route for transporting crude oil from the Middle East.

China explicitly states in its laws and other means that its Navy assumes the role of safeguarding maritime

rights and interests and protecting maritime safety. Moreover, taking into general consideration the conditions
of the country, including its geographic conditions and economic globalization, Chinese naval activities are
considered to have the following objectives.

The first objective is to intercept naval operations by enemies in waters as far as possible from the country

to defend Chinese territory and territorial waters. Behind this, there is an increase in effectiveness of long-range
attacks due to recent progress in science and technology.

The second objective is to develop military capabilities to deter and prevent the independence of Taiwan. For

example, China maintains that it will not allow any foreign intervention in solving the Taiwan issue and realizing
the unification of China. If China aims to hold back by force the foreign intervention into Taiwan, which is
surrounded by the sea, it needs to enhance its maritime military operational capabilities.

The third objective is to acquire, maintain, and protect maritime rights and interests. China has embarked on

exploration and drilling of oil and gas fields as well as building facilities and surveying for such facilities in the
East China Sea and South China Sea. This includes the building of drilling facilities in the oil and gas field, whose
geographical structure runs to the eastern side of the intermediate line between Japan and China. It is believed
that naval vessels’ operation near the drilling facilities in September 2005 aimed to flaunt the capabilities to
acquire, maintain, and protect maritime rights and interests.

The fourth objective is to defend the sea lines of communications for China, a lifeline for the increasingly

globalized Chinese economy. It depends on future international situations at the time as to how far the Chinese
Navy should defend the sea lines of communications by itself, but given recent modernization of the Chinese
Navy and Air Force, the scope of its capabilities appears to be expanding beyond waters near China.

Attention must be paid to the trends of Chinese maritime activities with the apparent objectives described

above, including the operation of naval vessels and implementation of oceanographic research activities near
Japan, and the development of facilities that will serve as bases for these activities[86].


-----

**3. Military Capabilities of Taiwan**
It is assumed that Taiwan employs a military strategy comprised of “Resolute Defense and Effective Deterrence.”
Specifically, it is said that this strategy details issues such as forcing enemies to abandon any military attempts
towards Taiwan by enlarging their uncertainty for victory and forecasted damage through constructing defense
forces for counteracting enemy invasions[87].

Taiwan has been implementing the Jingjing Program, in order to manage the national defense resources more

efficiently, to reduce the total number of military personnel, to restructure the organizations, and to shift to a
voluntary service system, since January 2004. According to the program, the number of military personnel will
be reduced to 275,000 by the end of 2008. At the same time, the Taiwanese armed forces attribute importance
to the introduction of advanced technologies and improvement of joint operational capabilities. Taiwan’s ratio
of its defense expenditure to its GDP remained below 3% since 2000; however, in August 2005, then Taiwanese
President Chen Shui-ban announced Taiwan’s policy to increase the ratio of the national defense budget to
its GDP up to 3% within three years, which was approximately 2.4% in FY 2005, in order to meet increasing
demands for national defense. Taiwan states that it reached a ratio of 3% in 2008[88]. (See Fig. I-2-3-6)

**Fig. I-2-3-6 Changes in Taiwan’s Defense Budget**

Defense Budget (100 million Taiwan dollars)
Year-on-year growth rate (%)


04 05 06 07 08

(FY)

Note: Based on The Military Balance of the corresponding years.

At present, Taiwan has 41 army brigades and three marine brigades with a total of approximately 215,000

personnel. In addition, it is believed that the total of 1.65 million reserve personnel of air, naval, and ground
forces would be available in case of war. Regarding naval capabilities, Kidd-class destroyers imported from the
United States have been commissioned, and Taiwan also possesses relatively modern frigates. Regarding air
capabilities, Taiwan possesses F-16 A/B fighters, Mirage 2000 fighters, and Jing Guo fighters.

In view of the fact that China is enhancing its missile, naval, and air forces, the Taiwanese military believes

it still needs to modernize the equipment. The Executive Yuan of Taiwan formulated a draft budget in June 2004
in order to purchase eight diesel submarines and 12 patrol planes (P-3C), upgrade its existing PAC-2 surfaceto-air patriot missiles, and purchase the new PAC-3 type missiles from the United States. However, due to
confrontation between the ruling and opposing parties, approval was not given until 2006 in the Legislative Yuan
where the opposing party controls the majority. Nevertheless, the ruling and opposing parties were successful in
reaching a compromise on the FY 2007 budget, and the FY 2007 and FY 2008 budgets include funds necessary


-----

for equipment purchases from the United States that the parties reached agreement on, including 12 patrol planes
(P-3C), upgrading PAC-2 missiles, and PAC-3 missiles. Taiwan currently wishes to purchase F-16 C/D fighters,
AH-64D attack helicopters, and other equipment from the United States, and attention will be paid to future
trends in this situation.

Taiwan is also promoting the independent development of equipment. Tien Kung II surface-to-air missiles

and Hsiung Feng II anti-ship missiles have been deployed and Hsiung Feng IIE cruise missiles are also being
developed in order to acquire long-range attack capabilities.

The general characteristics of Chinese and Taiwanese military forces are believed to be as follows:
1) Regarding ground forces, China possesses an overwhelming troop force; however, their capacity for landing

on and invading the island of Taiwan is limited. Nevertheless, China is making efforts to improve its landing
and invasion capabilities, such as by building large landing ships in recent years.
2) Regarding naval and air forces, China has outnumbered Taiwan in terms of quantity while Taiwan has had

qualitative superiority thus far. However, China has been steadily modernizing its naval and air forces in
recent years.
3) Regarding missile attack capabilities, China possesses numerous short-range ballistic missiles with a range

that covers Taiwan, and Taiwan seems to have few effective countermeasures.

However, in addition to the size of a country’s forces and the performance and quantity of equipment, a

comparison of military capabilities should take into account various factors such as the objectives and dimensions
of envisioned military operations, operational posture, proficiency of military personnel, and logistics. In view of
this, attention should be paid to the modernization of both the Chinese and Taiwanese military capabilities and
the U.S. weapon sale to Taiwan. As China is rapidly modernizing its military forces, the military balance between
China and Taiwan is changing to the advantage of China, and it might cause major changes in the near future in
Taiwan’s qualitative superiority.

Section 4. Russia

**1. General Situation**
Russian citizens support the former Putin administration’s policy that only a strong nation can deliver order and
stability. In December 2007, the ruling party United Russia, with former President Putin atop the candidate list,
secured more than two-thirds[89] in the State Duma (lower house), which was regarded as a sweeping victory.

In February 2008, then President Putin delivered a speech entitled “Russia’s Development Strategy through

to 2020,” which set forth the nation’s long-term perspective leading up to the year 2020. Thereupon, the former
Putin administration has been accredited for breaking away from the crisis of the 1990s and restoring the country
to its status as a powerful player within the international community. In the future, the administration aims to
promote social and economic reform that departs from a dependence on the energy resources sector under a
qualitatively new development strategy.

Furthermore, in regards to security, an unintentional

arms race has begun, and the administration has noted that
countermeasures against the U.S. and the North Atlantic
Treaty Organization (NATO) are in need as NATO military
facilities are closing in on the Russian border. In addition,
against the backdrop of Russia’s robust economy[90], the
administration has stressed the need to modernize the
military in accordance with national strength while also
avoiding an excessive arms race.

President Medvedev[91], who took office in May 2008,

has designated former President Putin as prime minister in
charge of policy implementation. As such, it appears that
the Medvedev administration will essentially continue
policy implemented by the Putin administration.

**2. Security and Defense Policies**

**1. Basic Posture**
Russia revised its “National Security Concept of the Russian Federation” in January 2000[92]. The Concept recognizes
that two exclusive trends exist in the current international situation—the trend toward a multipolar world promoted
by countries including Russia and the trend toward establishing a world dominated by Western countries. The
document lists[93] such phenomena as terrorism, a movement to decrease the role of the United Nations[94] and the
eastward expansion of NATO as threats to Russia’s security under these international circumstances. It also states
that Russia’s national security has been weakened by these factors as well as by an increase of hi-tech weapons in
Western countries, and by a delay in the reforms of Russia’s armed forces and the military-industrial complex. The
Concept concludes that from this perspective, Russia should take deterrent measures, including the possession of
nuclear forces, to prevent invasions of any scale.

In line with this Concept, the Military Doctrine of the Russian Federation was drafted in April 2000 as the basic

philosophy underlying Russian national defense policies. The Doctrine states that potential threats remain both at
home and abroad and in some areas these latent threats are growing despite the decreased possibility of large-scale
wars and the reduced threat of a direct invasion in a traditional form. Based on this recognition, it states that the
objective of national defense is to deter aggression by any means including the use of nuclear weapons and that
Russia reserves the right to use nuclear weapons in retaliatory attacks in response to a large-scale invasion with the
use of conventional weapons.


-----

In addition, The Priority Tasks of the Development of the Armed Forces of the Russian Federation was

published in 2003 to embody the aforementioned Concept and Doctrine. Concerning military duties, this report
points out the possibility of using armed forces not only for national defense but also for the implementation of
various peacetime operations[95] including counterterrorism measures. Furthermore, the importance of the intertheater mobility of permanent combat-ready troops[96] is also pointed out in consideration of the vastness of the
Russian territory.

Former President Putin directed the Defense Minister and others to review the National Security Concept,

and currently (as of May 2008) amendments to the Concept are being made.

**2. Military Reform**
Since 1997, Russia has shown progress in the modernization of military forces, including the reduction of the
number of soldiers, structural reforms, and the development and introduction of new types of equipment, and in
the improvement of combat readiness. The country appears to be nearing its troop reduction goal—a goal set in
order to maintain an adequate troop level of one million personnel[97].

In structural reforms, a shift to three services and three independent corps and the integration of military

districts are nearing completion. Regarding the modernization of military forces, in October 2006 the president
approved the state policy on military equipment for the period of 2007 to 2015, and accordingly, approximately
five trillion rubles (approximately 22.2 trillion yen) will be spent in the development and procurement of military
equipment by 2015[98]. At the same time, efforts are being made to create an integrated order placement system in
order to realize efficient procurement. Moreover, in order to improve the quality of military personnel and maintain
highly skilled forces, Russia is implementing measures toward the introduction of a contract-based service, under
which soldiers are recruited not by conscription but by contract[99]. Together with the ongoing improvement of the
permanent combat-ready troops, a contract-based service would contribute to the improvement of the Russian
military’s combat readiness. In so doing, Russia recognizes the issues of improving the treatment of soldiers and
securing personnel with technical knowledge and abilities[100]. In addition, Russia has been improving the military
unit command system, and it is thought that Russia will continue these measures to improve conventional armed
forces along with its efforts to maintain its strategic nuclear deterrent capability against the backdrop of the
national defense budget that has been increasing in recent years. (See Fig. I-2-4-1)

**3. The Chechen Issue**
Triggered by the invasion of armed groups of Chechen rebels into the Republic of Dagestan in 1999, the armed
forces of the Russian Federation commenced military actions against the groups (the Second Chechen War).
There were frequent terrorist attacks by armed Chechen groups, including the occupation of a Moscow theater
in October 2002 and the takeover of a school in the Republic of North Ossetia in September 2004. The Russian
Federation is promoting anti-terrorism operations with the Commonwealth of Independent States (CIS) and
NATO members while also conducting thorough mop-up operations against the armed groups.

Meanwhile, in the Chechen Republic, a new constitution was adopted in 2003 and a new president for

the Republic was designated by the Russian Federation in March 2007. The Russian Federation has thus been
implementing measures to stabilize Chechen. Moreover, as a result of mop-up operations by the Russian
Federation, leaders of pro-independence armed forces including Shamil Basayev, regarded as an extreme
hardliner, were killed. However, the armed Chechen rebels have not been completely eliminated and the situation
still remains unstable.

**3. External Relations**

**1. Relations with the Commonwealth of Independent States (CIS)**
Russia promotes military integration with CIS member countries, stating that its vital interests are concentrated
in the territories of the CIS. Russia has dispatched its federal forces to remain in Ukraine, Georgia, Moldova,
Armenia, Tajikistan and Kyrgyz. It has also concluded agreements to form a joint air defense system and joint
border security treaties with CIS member countries[101]. (See Fig. I-2-4-2)

With increasing activities by Islamic armed forces in Central Asia/Caucasia, Russia pursued military

cooperation centered on counterterrorism measures in the region, and organized a Collective Rapid Deployment
Force in May 2001 within the framework of the CIS Collective Security Treaty Organization[102]. Since the U.S.
and other military forces launched the military campaign in Afghanistan following the 9/11 terrorist attacks
against the United States in 2001[103], Russia has permitted U.S. assistance or U.S. military presence in Uzbekistan,
Kyrgyz, Tajikistan and Georgia. On the other hand, in 2003, Russia established an air force base in Kyrgyz
to enhance the CIS Collective Rapid Deployment Force[104]. Russia also had a division (approximately 8,000
personnel) stationed in Tajikistan, and later made an agreement with Tajikistan in October 2004, securing a
Russian military base in the country.

In the meantime, Georgia and Ukraine are aiming to strengthen their relations with Europe and the United

Sates for their future accession to NATO. In November 2007, a Russian base located in Georgia[105] was closed and
Russian forces withdrew from the area. As for Ukraine, the continued presence of the Russian Black Sea Fleet
may be a barrier to its future NATO membership.

**2. Relations with the United States**
The relationship between Russia and the United States has improved in various fields through cooperation in the
fight against terrorism and other measures[106]. The United States, however, has expressed concerns about domestic
affairs in Russia[107], while Russia has expressed concerns regarding U.S. foreign policy. Russia states that it must
take countermeasures against the U.S. in response to such activities as the large investments by the U.S. into
next-generation weapons development and deployment of U.S. military bases in Eastern European countries.

The United States, which has been developing its ballistic missile defense program, withdrew from the

Anti-Ballistic Missile (ABM) Treaty in June 2002. Russia criticized the U.S. decision as a mistake, but did
not regard it as a threat to Russia’s security. Subsequently, however, the United States agreed with the Czech
Republic and Poland to start full-scale negotiations to deploy part of its missile defense system to the countries.
Russia is strongly opposed to this, claiming that the system targets Russia and would negatively impact its
nuclear deterrent capabilities.

**3. Relations with NATO**
Russia, as a rule, has been against the accession to NATO of former Soviet Union countries as well as Central
and Eastern European countries.

However, Russia took steps to build a new cooperative relationship with NATO following the 9/11 terrorist

attacks in the United States, and within the framework of the NATO-Russia Council (NRC), Russia participates
in decision making to a certain degree and acts as an equal partner in areas of common interest[108]. Meanwhile,
Russia was dissatisfied that NATO countries would not ratify the Application Treaty of Conventional Armed
Forces in Europe (CFE)[109] because Russian forces would not withdraw from Georgia and Moldova. Thereafter,
discussions were held in such forums as the NRC; however, Russia suspended the CFE Treaty in December 2007,
halting inspections based on the treaty. Attention is paid whether NATO and Russia will hold any discussion on
the CFE Treaty in the future[110].

**4. Relations with Asian Countries**
Russia is currently implementing a pipeline project to transport Siberian oil to the Far East and developing natural
gas fields in Sakhalin. In order to develop these underground resources and revitalize its regional economy
and social infrastructure, it is important for Russia to enhance economic relations with Asia-Pacific countries
including Japan and China. For this reason, Russia emphasizes relations with these countries in its foreign policy
and has joined the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC[111]), the ASEAN Regional Forum (ARF), and the


-----

Shanghai Cooperation Organization (SCO). (See Section 3)[112] Additionally, Russia signed the Treaty of Amity
and Cooperation in Southeast Asia (TAC) in 2004. Furthermore, former President Putin actively engaged in
summit diplomacy with Asian countries. For example, he maintained close relationships with China and India
through annual reciprocal top-level visits and in July 2006, Russia held its first trilateral summit meeting with
Chinese and Indian leaders[113].

**5. Exportation of Arms**
Russia seems to actively promote the export of arms not only to maintain the infrastructure of the military industry
and to make economic profit, but also to help promote better foreign policy. The country’s export value has been
increasing in recent years. In January 2007, the Russian government granted the exclusive right to export arms to
the Rosoboronexport State Corporation[114] as part of its lasting efforts to improve its export system. In addition,
Russia regards the military industry as an integral part of the nation’s military organization and is committed to
improving and further developing the military industry by such measures as promoting the integration of aircraft
companies such as Sukhoi, MiG and Tupolev.

Russia has exported jet fighters and warships to countries including China, India and ASEAN member

countries[115]. In addition, Russia signed agreements with North Korea and Iran on military technology cooperation
in 2001.

**4. Military Posture**

**1. Nuclear Forces**
The Russian military emphasizes nuclear forces in order
to supplement its conventional forces. In addition, it
allots focus to nuclear forces to secure a global position
in the context of an increasingly multipolar world, and
as a balance with the nuclear forces of the United States.
It is believed that Russia is working to maintain a state
of immediate readiness for its nuclear force unit.

Russia is gradually reducing the number of its

strategic nuclear missiles due to issues such as aging.
However, it still possesses intercontinental ballistic
missiles (ICBM) following the United States in scale, submarine-launched ballistic missiles (SLBM) and longrange bombers (Tu-95MS Bears and Tu-160 Blackjacks).

Regarding the update of nuclear missiles, Russia began to accelerate the development and introduction of

new weapons, beginning with the deployment of new Topol-M ICBM (SS-27) units in 2005. In addition, flight
trials for the RS-24, which appear to be a multi-headed version of the Topol-M, began in 2007.

In April 2007, Russia launched a Borey-class ballistic missile submarine (nuclear powered) (SSBN); however,

it is believed that construction of the new SSBN is delayed in catching up with its initial schedule. Russia also
started a flight test in September 2005 for the new-type SLBM Bulava, which appears to mount Borey-class
SSBNs. However, it has been pointed out that all flight tests as of 2007 have been unsuccessful, and they have
not yet reached the stage of deployment.

In August 2007, then President Putin announced the resumption of regular patrol flights by the strategic

bomber unit, since they ceased following the disintegration of the Soviet Union in 1992. This activated flights by
Russian long-range bombers, which, other than large-scale exercises, had been terminated after the collapse of
the Soviet Union. Related countries are hurrying to respond to this.


-----

According to the Treaty on Strategic Offensive Reductions (better known as the Moscow Treaty), the United

States and Russia shall reduce the number of their deployable operational nuclear warheads to between 1,700
and 2,200 by December 31, 2012 (not including stored nuclear warheads). Continued attention should be paid to
the progress of the disposal program[116]. At the suggestion of the Russian side, negotiations began for a new treaty
(post-START) that would succeed the Strategic Arms Reduction Treaty I that is to expire in April 2008.

As for non-strategic nuclear forces, Russia had scrapped surface-launched short- and intermediate-range

missiles with a range of between 500 and 5,500km by 1991 in accordance with the Intermediate-Range Nuclear
Forces (INF) Treaty, and had removed tactical nuclear weapons deployed aboard naval vessels and stored them in
onshore missile silos in the following year. Russia, however, still possesses a broad array of nuclear forces[117].

**2. Conventional Forces and Other Issues**
Conventional forces have concentrated their limited resources on specific units to maintain their combat
readiness[118]. The Russian military is working to recover the proficiency of each of its forces and is conducting
large-scale exercises using its conventional forces in the direction of Europe (See Column). In addition, the
state policy on military equipment for the period of 2007 to 2015 instates plans for developing and procuring
equipment for conventional forces. However, there are issues such as difficulties in securing personnel and
lax military discipline due to the decrease in the population of young men as well as poor living conditions
for military personnel[119]. While the modernization of conventional forces is underway, development is not
necessarily sufficient.

The future development of the Russian economy and society remains unclear, and it is necessary to continue

to observe future trends of the Russian military.

**COMMENTARY**

**Large-scale Exercises by the Russian Military Units**

**in the Seas of the Mediterranean and the North Atlantic**

From December 2007 to February 2008, the Russian Navy and Air Force carried out large-scale exercises
in the seas of the Mediterranean and the North Atlantic. The country had taken stern stances toward the
United States and NATO since last year, opposing the U.S. plan to deploy the missile defense (MD) system
in Eastern Europe and suspending the implementation of the Conventional Forces in Europe (CFE) Treaty.

In August 2007, then President Putin announced the resumption of regular patrol flights by strategic

bomber troops. In light of this, the latest pelagic navigation exercises could be seen as a display of Russia’s
presence in the European region. Accordingly, the United Kingdom and Norway sent their air fighters as a
show of force against the Russian Air Force squad maneuvering above the North Atlantic during its joint
exercises with the Navy.

At the same time, Russia’s latest exercises also included joint training exercises with France, Italy and

Portugal aimed at promoting anti-terrorism and mutual friendship. These three countries were apparently
on the alert for the spread of terrorist activities en route to the Mediterranean Sea. It appears that Russia
is continuing its efforts to build cooperative ties with any European country to combat terrorism and other
areas of mutual strategic interest. The latest exercises mark the first deployment into the Mediterranean since
1996 by the Russian Navy’s aircraft carrier. They are also the first Russian Navy exercises joined by three
fleets since the collapse of the Soviet Union.

The commander in chief of the Russian Navy indicated on February 3 that Russia planned to promote

navigations similar to the latest one at least biannually, in order to build-up its presence in the global seas.


-----

This remark was made upon the commander’s return to Severomorsk, the home port of the Northern Fleet
that participated in the latest exercise. Attention is being paid to whether or not Russia will continue to
deploy its fleets to the Mediterranean and other distant seas.

**5. Russian Forces in the Far East Region**

**1. General Situation**
The current presence of the Russian military forces in the Far East region is comparatively much smaller than its
peak. However, a considerable scale of military forces including nuclear forces still remains in the region. The
declining trend of exercise activities has ceased, and in recent years activities have revitalized in association with
efforts for recovery of skill levels. Since 2003, Russia has conducted military exercises in the Far East region,
including “Vostok,” which is a biennial large-scale anti-terrorism exercise, and “Mobility 2004,” which was an
exercise for the country’s permanent combat-ready troops to deploy from the western part of Russia to the Far East
region. Additionally, in 2007, an air and logistics exercise called “Krylo 2007” was held in the Far East region.

It is necessary to continue to monitor the positioning and trends of Russian forces in the Far East region in

the future while taking into consideration that the overall forces tend to focus on maintaining combat readiness of
the strategic nuclear unit as well as dealing with conflicts by inter-theater mobility of its permanent combat-ready
troops. (See Fig. I-2-4-3)

**(1) Nuclear Forces**
As for strategic nuclear forces in the Far East region, ICBMs, such as SS-25s, and Tu-95MS Bear strategic
bombers are deployed along the Trans-Siberian Railway, and SSBNs, such as the Delta III-class nuclear
submarine carrying SLBMs, and others are deployed in and around the Sea of Okhotsk. The readiness of these
strategic nuclear forces appears to have been generally maintained.

As for non-strategic nuclear capabilities, Russian forces in the Far East region possess a variety of weapons,

including medium-range bombers such as Tu-22M Backfires and sea- (undersea) and air-launched cruise missiles.
A total of approximately 70 Backfires are deployed in the west of Lake Baikal and coastal areas, including the
area across from Sakhalin.

**(2) Ground Forces**
Ground forces in the Far East region have continuously shrunk in scale since 1990 and currently consist of 15
divisions of approximately 90,000 personnel[120].

Also, the Pacific Fleet of the Russian Navy has a naval infantry division with an amphibious capability. (See

Fig. I-2-4-4)

**(3) Naval Forces**
The Pacific Fleet is stationed and deployed from its main bases in Vladivostok and Petropavlovsk. The fleet


-----

comprises approximately 240 ships with a total displacement in the region of about 600,000 tons, including 20
major surface ships and about 20 submarines (about 15 of which are nuclear-powered submarines) with a total
displacement of approximately 280,000 tons. The forces have been scaled down since 1990. (See Fig. I-2-4-5)

**2. Russian Forces in Japan’s Northern Territories**
Since 1978 under the regime of the former Soviet Union, Russia has been redeploying ground troops on the
Kunashiri, Etorofu, and Shikotan Islands of Japan’s Northern Territories. These territories are illegally occupied
by Russia although they are an integral part of Japanese territory. However, the numbers of military personnel are
considered to be far less than at past peak times. Nevertheless, tanks, armored vehicles, various types of artillery,
and anti-air missiles are still deployed in the region. With regard to ground forces in the Northern Territories, then
President Yeltsin officially announced during his visit to Japan in 1993 that half of the troops stationed on the
four islands had already been withdrawn and the remaining half, with the exception of the national border guard,
would also be removed. In the late 1990s, Russia repeatedly stated at various official meetings with Japan that the
number of Russian troops stationed in this region had been reduced. The number of Russian military personnel
stationed in this region in 1991 was approximately 9,500, and at the Japan-Russia Summit Meeting held in 1997,
then Russian Defense Minister Rodionov made it clear that the troops stationed in the Northern Territories had
been reduced to 3,500 soldiers by 1995. In July 2005, however, when then Russian Defense Minister Ivanov
visited the Northern Territories, he declared that Russia would neither increase nor decrease the troops stationed
on the four islands, clearly showing the intention to maintain the status quo.

As mentioned above, Russian troops continue to be stationed in the Northern Territories, which are an integral

part of Japanese territory, and it is hoped that the issue will be resolved at an early date.

**3. Operations in the Vicinity of Japan**
Russian military operations seem to be increasingly more active in the vicinity of Japan, including exercises and
training, in association with the recovery of troop skill levels.

The number of exercises carried out by Russian ground forces in areas adjacent to Japan decreased sharply

from peak numbers; however, some activities seem to
be on the rise again.

With regard to naval vessels, there is a sign of

change in naval training and other activities. For
example, long-term sea training by submarines and
surface ships was conducted for the first time in several
years, and nuclear submarines resumed their patrols.

Regarding aircraft, a tendency of revitalization

in such activities as flights close to Japan’s territorial
airspace, exercises and training, can be seen. In July
2007, Tu-95MS Bears flew near Guam, and on February
9, 2008, Tu-95MS Bears entered into Japanese territorial

Tu-95 bomber that invaded Japanese airspace on February 9, 2008

airspace (above Sofugan Island in the southern Izu
Islands)[121]. (See Fig. I-2-4-8)

Section 5. Southeast Asia

**1. General Situation**
Southeast Asian countries have made efforts for political stability and steady economic growth while deepening
interdependent relationships with countries both inside and outside the region. The region is encompassed
by the Straits of Malacca, the South China Sea, and the waters around Indonesia and the Philippines, thus
occupying a key position for traffic by linking the Pacific and Indian Oceans. However, this region still has
destabilizing factors, including the territorial dispute over the Spratly Islands, ethnic minority issues, separatist
and independence movements, and Islamic extremist groups. Moreover, there are incidents such as piracy by
which the safe passage of ships is obstructed. In response to these situations, the countries in the region are
working to build sufficient military forces not only for traditional national defense but also to address the new
security issues such as anti-terrorism and piracy. In recent years, against the backdrop of economic development,
they have been modernizing their military forces, through the introduction of new warships and other measures
to build naval capability and the introduction of new fighters. (See Fig. I-2-5-1)

**2. Relations with the United States**
Many Southeast Asian countries have been developing cooperative security relationships with the United States.

Singapore supports the United States’ presence in the Asia-Pacific. The two countries signed a memorandum of

understanding in 1990 permitting the United States to use military facilities in Singapore. This allows U.S. forces to


-----

promptly respond to an emergency in the Middle East and Africa. The United States ranks Singapore as a Major
Security Cooperation Partner. In July 2005, the two countries signed the Strategic Framework Agreement between
the United States of America and the Republic of Singapore for a Closer Cooperation Partnership in Defense and
Security to further strengthen cooperation in areas such as counterterrorism, prevention of the proliferation of
weapons of mass destruction, defense technology, joint military exercises and training, and policy dialogues.

The Philippines and the United States maintain a long-lasting cohesive military cooperation[122]. They resumed

the large-scale joint military exercise, Balikatan in 2000 and have since conducted the exercise on an annual basis.
At Balikatan 08, held from February to March 2008, the two nations conducted command post exercises and
civic assistance activities in Mindanao and other areas. The Philippines and United States have also conducted
other joint exercises, including Balance Piston and Talon Vision.

Thailand and the United States started joint military exercise Cobra Gold in 1982, and the exercise has been

multinational since 2000. In response to the military coup in Thailand in September 2006, the United States
announced the suspension of military aid of about $29 million in total to Thailand. However, the military exercise
Cobra Gold 07 in 2007 was held as usual. The suspension of military aid was lifted in light of the December 2007
general election. At the joint exercises in May 2008, besides command post exercises, non-combat missions such
as disaster relief and humanitarian assistance were held[123].

In 2003, the United States granted Major Non-NATO Ally status[124] to the Philippines and Thailand, since the

United States recognized their proactive participation in the U.S.-led War on Terror.

In February 2005, the United States expressed its intent to resume the International Military Education and

Training (IMET)[125] program for Indonesia, which had been suspended since 1992. Subsequently, in November 2005,
the United States decided to resume weapon sales to Indonesia. In addition, on his February 2008 visit to Indonesia,
U.S. Secretary of Defense Robert Gates held dialogue with President Yudhoyono and Minister of Defense Juwono
Sudarsono, where they agreed to strengthen military cooperation and counter piracy and terrorism.

Regarding relations with Viet Nam, in June 2005 then Vietnamese Prime Minister Phan Van Khai visited the

United States. On his visit the two countries concluded an IMET agreement and major developments were seen
regarding military cooperation. In June 2006, then U.S. Defense Secretary Donald Rumsfeld visited Viet Nam
where he held dialogue with then Vietnamese Defense Minister Pham Van Tra, and agreement was reached to
expand military exchanges between the two countries.
Many U.S. defense-related personnel, including the
Defense Secretary and Commander of U.S. Pacific
Command, visited Viet Nam between 2006 and 2007,
and in April 2007, the United States partially lifted its
arms embargo on Viet Nam[126].

In this way, the United States is developing

relationships of confidence with the Southeast Asian
countries and working to strengthen the readiness of
them through numerous joint military exercises such
as the multilateral military exercise Cobra Gold and

Medical support for the local people by the U.S. military and the Philippine military

the bilateral sea exercise CARAT[127], provision of at the Exercise Balikatan [U.S. Army]
military technology, and military assistance.

**3. Relations with China**
There are currently territorial disputes between Southeast Asian countries and China over the Spratly Islands
and the Paracel Islands[128]. At the ASEAN-China Summit Meeting held in November 2002, ASEAN member
countries and China signed the Declaration on the Conduct of Parties in the South China Sea[129], which aims


-----

for a peaceful settlement of the territorial issue. However, no major development has been seen in the drafting
of a Regional Code of Conduct in the South China Sea[130], which would provide more concrete behavior and
possess legal binding force. Moreover, it is said that China conducted military exercises in the Paracel Islands in
November 2007 and, in December 2007, the Chinese Government approved the establishment of “Sansha City,”
which includes the Spratly Islands. In opposition to these actions, there have been public-level demonstrations
in Viet Nam.

In recent years, China has actively pushed the related countries to give priority to the development of resources

in the waters surrounding the Spratly Islands, setting aside the territorial issue. For example, in September 2004,
China and the Philippines agreed on a joint oil field exploration in the waters of the Spratly Islands, and in
March 2005, China, the Philippines, and Viet Nam reached an agreement on the launch of a joint exploration
of oil and natural gas in the South China Sea. Furthermore, the establishment of a joint working group on
resource development in the South China Sea between ASEAN and China was approved by the ASEAN Foreign
Ministers’ Meeting held in July 2005.

In recent years, China has been making efforts to develop cooperative relations with Southeast Asian countries

by such means as visits by government officials via bilateral and multilateral frameworks.

In the defense sector as well, senior military officials have made visits between China and Southeast Asian

countries, and a joint patrol was launched in the Gulf of Tonkin with Vietnamese and Chinese Naval vessels in
April 2006 as a unit-level exchange and cooperation. In July 2007, the special forces of China and Thailand came
together to conduct Strike-2007, a joint counterterrorism military exercise. In addition, in November 2007, China
donated patrol ships to Cambodia as a means for assistance. At the China-ASEAN Summit Meeting in November
2007, Premier Wen Jiabao expressed China was prepared to strengthen cooperation with ASEAN countries in the
sector of unconventional security, and it was ready to provide funds for such uses as marine surveying training
on the Straits of Malacca.

**4. Regional Issues and Cooperation**
Southeast Asian nations utilize ASEAN as a multilateral security framework for the region. In addition to the
ASEAN Regional Forum (ARF), a dialogue forum on the political and security sectors in the Asia-Pacific region
launched in 1994, the first ASEAN Defense Ministers’ Meeting was held in May 2006, and the second installment
of the said meeting was held in November 2007. Furthermore, at the 13th ASEAN Summit in November 2007, the
ASEAN Charter was adopted that contains the basic principles for establishing ASEAN community by 2015[131].
The direction of an organizational reform was the subject for attention since effective measures have yet to be
taken against Myanmar, as ASEAN takes a consensus method and the noninterference principle. However, the
ASEAN Charter bases itself on the traditional condition of unanimous approval by all member countries and,
in the event unanimous approval is not attained, the way of decision shall be made at the summit meeting. The
Charter states that if there is a serious breach of the Charter or non-compliance, the matter will be referred to
the ASEAN summit for decision and also includes the establishment of a human rights body, strengthening the
functions of ASEAN.

In the Southeast Asian region, multilateral cooperation is being promoted in order to deal with transnational

issues such as terrorism and piracy. ASEAN countries have continuously discussed the issue of terrorism at various
ASEAN meetings, and at the ASEAN Regional Forum (ARF) Ministerial Meeting in July 2006, the ministers
adopted the ARF Statement on Cooperation in Fighting Cyber Attack and Terrorist Misuse of Cyber Space.

In July 2004, Malaysia, Indonesia, and Singapore started the Trilateral Coordinated Patrols for vigilance

against pirates in the Straits of Malacca and Singapore. In this effort, the naval forces of the three countries patrol
their own territories in cooperation with each other. Subsequently, in September 2005, the countries launched
their joint coastline airborne patrols codenamed Eyes in the Sky. Since 2004, Malaysia, Singapore, the United


-----

Kingdom, Australia, and New Zealand have conducted joint exercises including maritime interdiction training
within the framework of the Five Powers Defense Arrangements (FPDA). In addition, the Regional Cooperation
Agreement on Combating Piracy and Armed Robbery against Ships in Asia (ReCAAP[132]), which was proposed
and promoted by Japan, entered into force in September 2006 and the ReCAAP Information Sharing Centre was
established in November 2006 in Singapore based on the agreement[133].

Since August 2007, there have been frequent large-scale anti-government demonstrations in various areas of

Myanmar predominantly by monks. The Myanmar government deployed its military to repress the demonstrations.
These governmental efforts injured and killed a large number of people. Furthermore, the cyclone in May 2008
victimized and caused extensive damage, including house destruction and severing of transportation systems
and lifelines. In response to this disaster, many countries offered to dispatch rescue personnel, but the Myanmar
government refused them except those from Thailand, India, China, and Bangladesh. Nonetheless, later on,
having been approached by ASEAN and the U.N., the Myanmar government agreed to accept rescue personnel
of humanitarian support objectives. In addition, soon after the disaster, the Myanmar government administered a
national referendum regarding a new constitution whose content includes maintaining military authority, as was
initially planned.

Australia, New Zealand, Portugal, and Malaysia dispatched international security forces to East Timor in

April 2006 in response to a worsening security situation, and in August 2006, the United Nations Integrated
Mission in Timor-Leste (UNMIT) was established[134]. Beginning in April 2007, there was a presidential election
and a parliamentary election, and these elections concluded without any major disturbances as security measures
were reinforced by international security forces. However, in February 2008, President Jose Ramos-Horta and
Prime Minister Xanana Guzmao were assaulted by an armed group. In response to this, a state of emergency was
declared in the country[135] and the U.N. extended the mandate of UNMIT until February 26, 2009[136]. It is reported
that there has not been any major turmoil following the shooting incident; however, the security situation remains
unstable and the country’s process for stability in the future will gather attention.

**5. Military Modernization in the Region**
In recent years, Southeast Asian countries are modernizing their militaries against a backdrop of economic
development and other factors. In regards to air forces, in 2004, Viet Nam imported Russian Su-30 fighters and
Indonesia imported Russian Su-27 and Su-30 fighters. Indonesia plans to purchase U.S. F-16 fighters as well. In
2005, Singapore concluded a contract with the United States to purchase U.S. F-15 fighters. In 2007, Singapore
concluded a contract to purchase additional F-15s, Malaysia imported Su-30 fighters, and Thailand decided to
import Swedish JAS-39 fighters.

In regards to naval forces, Malaysia, which had not previously possessed submarines, concluded a contract in

2002 to purchase Scorpène-class submarines, which were jointly developed by France and Spain. Furthermore,
in 2005, Singapore signed contracts to purchase Swedish Vastergotland-class submarines. In 2007, Singapore
commissioned a French Formidable-class frigate, and also plans to commission a total of six of these, including
those produced domestically, by 2009. In 2007, Indonesia commissioned two Sigma-class Corvettes, and plans
to commission a total of four by 2009. Moreover, in September 2007, Indonesia and Russia agreed to strengthen
military technology and defense cooperation. The two nations signed a statement of mutual agreement concerning
the procurement of Russian weapons on the scale of $1 billion through government loans, and this agreement is
reported to include weapons such as two Kilo-class submarines.

Some point out that the military modernization of these countries can be attributed to economic growth

following the Asian currency crisis, and continued tensions in this region. Although the military modernization
does not yet amount to an arms race, in some cases, it can be observed that some Southeast Asian countries watch
their neighbors’ defense programs and react to them[137].

Section 6. South Asia

**1. India**

**1. General Situation**
India is surrounded by many countries and has long coastlines totaling 7,600km. The country has the world’s
second largest population of more than one billion following China and has great influence in the South Asian
region. Also, it has a geographic position that is significant in maritime traffic, connecting the Asia-Pacific region
with the Middle East and Europe. In particular, Andaman and Nicobar Islands, located at the east end of the
country, are close to the Straits of Malacca, and India is expected to play an important role in maritime security.

India has multiple races, religions, languages and cultures within it, but it has an administration elected

through free and fair elections under the multi-party system and is the world’s largest democratic nation[138]. Also,
India shares a lot with major developed countries including Japan in terms of fundamental values and systems,
such as liberalism, democracy and a market economy.

**2. Foreign Policies**

**(1) Basic Posture**
India has been promoting economic liberalization and reform since the 1990s. Against the backdrop of a favorable
economy, the country is actively engaging in multilateral diplomacy[139], thereby steadily increasing its presence in
the international community. In the field of security as well, India’s rapid expansion of military cooperation with
friendly nations not only strengthens the security environment of the South Asia region, but also is expected to
enhance security worldwide. In recent years, India has been making efforts to expand military exchanges, such
as by conducting joint exercises with various other countries[140].

**(2) United States**
India is actively striving to strengthen bilateral relations with the United States, while the United States is also
promoting the expansion of involvement in India in line with the economic growth of India, thus leading to
increasingly stronger mutual relationships in various fields.

The U.S.-India joint declaration, which was made when then Prime Minister of India Vajpayee visited the

United States in November 2001, confirmed that qualitative improvement should be made for future bilateral
relations. In January 2004, the two countries announced that they had agreed to expand mutual cooperation in
the following three areas: non-military nuclear activities, space programs and high-technology trade, aiming to
form a strategic partnership between the two countries. In July 2005, Indian Prime Minister Manmohan Singh
visited the United States and made a joint statement with U.S. President George W. Bush that the relationship
between the two countries would transform into a global partnership through which they would cooperate in the
fields of space exploration, nuclear energy for civilian applications, and military and non-military technologies.
Subsequently in March 2006, President Bush in turn visited India for the first time in his six years as president of
the United States[141], and agreed with Prime Minister Singh to strategically strengthen bilateral relations.

In the security field, in June 2005, then Indian Defense Minister Pranab Mukherjee and then U.S. Defense

Secretary Donald Rumsfeld signed a 10-year military agreement called the New Framework for the U.S.-India
Defense Relationship, based on the recognition that the U.S.-India defense relationship is an important pillar
in the mutually beneficial relations between the two countries, which are changing over time. In March 2006,
the U.S. Department of Defense announced its intention to enhance cooperation with India on security issues,
including maritime security[142]. Furthermore, in February of this year, U.S. Secretary of Defense Robert Gates


-----

paid a visit to India and held discussions with Prime Minister Singh and other leaders[143].

India and the United States have made active military exchanges, including joint military exercises. The

Indian and U.S. navies carried out the joint naval exercise Malabar 07-1 off the coast of Okinawa in April of last
year, and in September also held Malabar 07-2 off the coast of the area surrounding the Bay of Bengal. Malabar
07-2 was participated in by aircraft carriers of the U.S. and Indian navies in which anti-air, anti-submarine, antisurface warfare, and other exercises were carried out, thus enhancing the joint exercise with the United States in
terms of both quality and quantity[144].

As for cooperation in civilian nuclear activities, U.S. President George W. Bush changed the previous

policy prohibiting cooperation with countries not participating in the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear
Weapons (NPT) and agreed in July 2005 with Indian Prime Minister Singh on the cooperation in civilian nuclear
activities for India, who is not yet a member of the NPT, in reply to India’s implementation of various measures
in terms of reduction of its military size and non-proliferation of weapons. Subsequently, in March 2006,
U.S. President Bush agreed with Indian Prime Minister Singh on specific measures for the implementation of
cooperation in civilian nuclear activities. Furthermore, in December 2006, the U.S. Senate and Congress passed
the U.S.-India Peaceful Atomic Energy Cooperation
Act, which enables cooperation in civilian nuclear
activities with India, where comprehensive safeguards
by the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA)
were not applied. The act was signed by President Bush
and enacted in the same month.

In July 2007, India and the United States announced

that they had completed negotiations on the bilateral
agreement for peaceful nuclear cooperation. In August
2007, the two countries announced the text of the
bilateral agreement on Cooperation for Peaceful Uses
of Nuclear Energy. In November 2007, India and the
IAEA started negotiation to finalize an India-specific The “Malabar 07-2” [U.S. Navy]
Safeguards Agreement with the IAEA.

**(3) China**
India has been trying to improve relations with China through mutual visits by leaders despite the national border
issues between the two countries and concerns over Chinese nuclear weapons and missiles and the modernization
of its military force, including naval forces. In June 2003, then Indian Prime Minister Vajpayee visited China
for the first time in the past 10 years as Indian Prime Minister and signed with Chinese Premier Wen Jiabao the
Declaration on Principles for Relations and Comprehensive Cooperation[145] between the Republic of India and the
People’s Republic of China. In November 2003, the Indian and Chinese navies carried out joint naval exercises for
the first time off the coast of Shanghai. Furthermore, when Chinese Minister of National Defense Cao Gangchuan
visited India in March 2004, the two countries agreed on the expansion of military exchanges. Subsequently in
December 2004, based on this agreement, a visit to China by an Indian Chief of Army Staff was made for the
first time by the two countries’ Vice Foreign Ministers. When Chinese Premier Wen Jiabao visited India in April
2005, the two countries reached an agreement on establishing a strategic and cooperative partnership for peace
and prosperity[146]. In November 2006, Chinese President Hu Jintao visited India for the first time in 10 years as
the Chinese president to meet with Indian Prime Minister Manmohan Singh. Both agreed that the development
of a strategic and cooperative partnership between China and India is commonly recognized as an important issue
and announced a joint declaration that includes holding regular summit meetings[147]. Furthermore, in December


-----

of 2007, the first joint military exercise by the armies of the two countries – an India-China anti-terrorism joint
exercise – took place in Yunnan Province in China[148]. In addition, in January of 2008, Indian Prime Minister
Singh visited China, and with Chinese Premier Wen Jiabao signed a joint document aiming for “A Shared Vision
for the 21st Century[149].”

**(4) Russia**
India has traditionally been on friendly terms with Russia and maintains close relations with the country through
mutual visits made annually by their leaders. In October 2000, the two countries signed the Declaration of
Strategic Partnership to further strengthen their bilateral relations, and have been promoting acquisition of T-90
tanks by India from Russia as well as joint development of a supersonic cruise missile[150]. In January 2007, then
Russian President Vladimir Putin visited India and both leaders announced a joint statement as well as signed
agreements, including one for the construction of nuclear power plants and an intergovernmental agreement on
the peaceful use of the Global Navigation Satellite System (GLONASS)[151]. In November 2007, Indian Prime
Minister Singh visited Russia, and held talks with then President Putin[152].

Russia is a major supplier of weapons to India[153]. In January 2004, then Russian Defense Minister Ivanov

visited India and concluded a contract to sell a retired aircraft carrier, the Admiral Gorshkov, to India. Also in
January 2007, then Russian Defense Minister Ivanov visited India and conducted a consultation meeting on
military technology cooperation, joint exercises, and other issues[154].

In addition, the two countries have conducted joint military exercises since 2003[155].

**(5) Asian Countries**
Since the latter half of the 1990s, India has been emphasizing relations with East Asian countries, including
ASEAN members. In October 2003, it signed the Treaty of Amity and Cooperation in Southeast Asia (TAC)[156].
Historically on good terms with Japan, India has been deepening cooperation with Japan in various fields
including economy and security based on a global partnership.

In May 2006, India’s then Defense Minister Mukherjee visited Japan and announced a joint statement along

with Director General of the DFAA Nukaga. In this statement, the two countries agreed to deepen dialogue and
cooperation in the field of defense cooperation.

**3. National Defense Policy**
India, as its national security policies, lists the possession of military capabilities to protect national interests
and the minimum level deterrent against nuclear threats; response to various security challenges ranging from
terrorism and low-intensity conflicts to conventional wars and nuclear wars; and enhancement of international
cooperation to deal with new threats such as terrorism and weapons of mass destruction.

India intends to maintain minimum credible nuclear deterrence while committing to no first use on nuclear

weapons and maintaining the unilateral moratorium (temporary suspension) on nuclear tests that it announced
immediately after the nuclear test conducted in 1998. In addition, in its nuclear doctrine released in January 2003,
India expressed its commitment to continuing export controls of nuclear weapons and missile-related materials
and technologies, and participating in the Fissile Material Cut-off Treaty negotiations, as well as to creating a
nuclear-free world. However, the doctrine declares that India will retain the option of retaliating with nuclear
weapons in the event of a major attack against India by biological or chemical weapons.

The Indian Armed Forces include ground forces of 12 corps with approximately 1,100,000 personnel; naval

forces of two fleets, totaling approximately 355,000 tons, and air forces of 19 combat air wings and others
with roughly 570 combat aircraft. India currently possesses one aircraft carrier, and in addition to promoting a
construction plan for one new domestic aircraft carrier, will introduce another aircraft carrier from Russia upon


-----

completion of repair work as explained later. In addition, in conjunction with the retirement of the now-degraded
MiG-21 fighter-interceptors, India is planning for procurement of multi-purpose fighter-interceptors, and in
February of 2007 Indian Defense Minister Antony announced that the country would procure 126 multi-purpose
fighter-interceptors through a bidding process[157].

In recent years India has been actively proceeding with the development of a ballistic missile capable of

mating with a nuclear warhead. In September 2003, India announced that it would operationally deploy the
Agni-2 intermediate-range ballistic missile with the army. Various types of ballistic missiles have been launched
for tests in India, and it was reported that in May 2008, the Agni-3 intermediate-range ballistic missile was
successfully test-launched for the third time. It has also been reported that India has begun development of the
Agni-4 long-range ballistic missile[158].

In addition, India is working toward the practical realization of ballistic missile defense as a defensive

response measure to threats against the homeland. In December 2007, a missile interceptor test was conducted,
and reported as a success[159]. (See Fig. I-2-6-1)

**2. Pakistan**

**1. General Situation**
Pakistan, with approximately 150 million people, borders India, Iran, Afghanistan, and China, and is one of the most
geopolitically important countries in Southwestern Asia. Currently, Pakistan’s attitude towards the international
fight against terrorism and non-proliferation of weapons of mass destruction is attracting increasing international
attention.

In recent years, Pakistani President Musharraf has been improving relations with India, including over the

Kashmir issue, and has also expressed his support for the U.S.-led anti-terrorism measures and non-proliferation
of weapons of mass destruction. Islamic extremist groups, both at home and abroad, have criticized President
Musharraf’s policy, and in December 2003 there were two assassination attempts on the president. In addition, the
administration of President Musharraf, who has entered his second term as civilian president, is facing direct threats,
including the assassination of former Prime Minister Bhutto in December 2007 and serious terrorist attacks.


-----

Going forward, achieving stability in Pakistan is crucial from the viewpoint of enhancing the international fight

against terrorism, preventing the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction and securing stability in South Asia.

**2. Foreign Policies**
Pakistan, while attaching importance to friendship and cooperation with Islamic countries, maintains close
relations with China as a countermeasure against India[160]. Since the 9/11 attacks on the United States, Pakistan
has been expressing its intention to join the U.S.-led fight against terrorism[161]. This cooperative attitude was
highly appreciated by the international community, and the sanctions that had been imposed on Pakistan by the
United States and other countries due to Pakistan’s nuclear test in 1998 were lifted[162]. Pakistan strengthened
military cooperation with the United States in the fight against terrorism. In March 2005 the United States
decided to sell F-16 fighters to Pakistan, lifting its freeze on the sale that had lasted over 20 years. Furthermore,
in March 2006, U.S. President Bush visited Pakistan, expressing deep appreciation for Pakistan’s support in
the global fight against terrorism, and the two countries confirmed their policy of promoting terrorism-related
information sharing[163].

Regarding the issue of nuclear proliferation involving Pakistan, President Musharraf disclosed in February

2004 that some Pakistani scientists, including Dr. A. Q. Khan, were involved in nuclear proliferation, although
the president denied the Pakistani government’s involvement in any kind of proliferation activity[164].

**3. National Defense Policy**
Pakistan claims that maintaining nuclear deterrence against the nuclear threat posed by India is essential to
ensure national security and self-defense.

The Pakistan Armed Forces include ground forces of nine corps with approximately 550,000 personnel;

one naval fleet of about 40 warships, totaling approximately 75,000 tons; and air forces including 12 air combat
wings with a total of roughly 380 combat aircraft.

In recent years, Pakistan has been actively proceeding with development of a ballistic missile capable of

mating with a nuclear warhead and cruise missiles. Pakistan first test-launched the Babur (Hatf-VII) cruise
missile in November 2005[165]. It also conducted the test launch of the Shaheen 2 (Hatf-VI) intermediate-range
ballistic missile in February 2007. From January to February 2008, in exercises of the Army Strategic Force
Command (ASFC), the Strategic Missile Group (SMG), following actions in 2006[166], it consecutively conducted
test launches of various intermediate-range ballistic missiles it owns, including the Ghauri (Hatf-V), and the
Shaheen 1 (Hatf-IV)[167]. And in April 2008, the first test launch of the intermediate-range ballistic missile Shaheen
2 (Hatf-VI) was conducted. This seems to demonstrate that Pakistan is steadily deploying ballistic missiles to its
forces. (See Fig. I-2-6-1)

**3. The India-Pakistan Relationship**
India and Pakistan, which became independent from the former British India after World War II, have had three
large armed conflicts over the Kashmir territorial issue[168] and others.

The territorial dispute over Kashmir has continued, with dialogues repeatedly resumed and suspended, and it

constitutes one of the root causes of confrontation between India and Pakistan.

India and Pakistan held vastly different opinions on Kashmir, and the solution of the issues was thought to

be difficult. However, in February 2004, “multiple dialogues” for the normalization of relations between the
two countries, including on the Kashmir issue, were initiated, and definite progress can be seen in the bilateral
relationship[169]. As tensions between the two countries have been mitigated, the question of whether they may
solve the issue in the future is attracting much attention from the international community.

Section 7. Australia

**1. National Defense Policy**
Australia, like Japan and the Republic of Korea, is allied with the United States. Australia has been broadly and
actively involved in resolving security issues in the Middle East and Asia-Pacific region in addition to those in
neighboring areas such as Timor-Leste and the Solomon Islands. (See Part III, Chapter 3, Section 2)

In December 2000, Australia announced “Defence 2000 - Our Future Defence Force,” which set forth its

defense policy for the coming decade. The document states that the missions of the Australian Defence Force
(ADF) are: first, to defend Australia; second, to contribute to the security of its immediate neighborhood; and
third, to contribute effectively to international coalitions of forces to meet crises beyond Australia’s immediate
neighborhood in support of Australia’s wider interests and objectives.

In order to respond to subsequent changes in the strategic environment, the Howard administration[170] reviewed

the national defense strategy approximately every two years, and the results were announced as “Australia’s
National Security: A Defence Update.”

“A Defence Update” issued in February 2003, which took into account the 9/11 terrorist attacks and the

bombing in Bali, Indonesia, in October 2002, designated terrorism, proliferation of weapons of mass destruction,
and failing states as priority issues for responding to the new strategic environment resulting from progressing
globalization, and predicted an increase in opportunities for ADF activities in remote regions.

“A Defence Update” issued in December 2005, taking into account the ADF’s participation in the military

operation in Iraq that began in March 2005 and the subsequent reconstruction activities, the Regional Assistance
Mission to the Solomon Islands (RAMSI) activities that began in July 2005[171], as well as terrorist acts in many
parts of the world, indicated the importance of the government’s integrated efforts to respond to increasingly
complex and diverse situations.

“A Defence Update” issued in July 2007, taking into account factors such as the ADF involvement in the

Middle East to that point, the dispatch of the ADF to the uprising in Timor-Leste[172], and nuclear issues in North
Korea and Iran[173], stated that the priority issues laid out in the above-mentioned 2003 report would remain in effect.
The report expected that the situation will continue where the ADF, while continuing activities in neighboring
regions, engages in activities in coalition with foreign forces in remote regions, including Iraq and Afghanistan.
In this way, the ADF aims to make a meaningful contribution to international security issues in remote regions, as
well as to take a leadership role in the neighboring region, which comprises many unstable island states. For all
of these activities, a high readiness posture is required. The report also mentions that although it remains unlikely
that Australia will face conventional military threats, in order to allow the country to independently defend
its territory without relying on the assistance of other countries in case of such an unlikely event occurring, it
continues to be of great importance to retain an edge in leading military capability in the region.

**2. Foreign Relations**

**1. Relations with the United States**
Australia attaches importance to its alliance with the United States based on the ANZUS Treaty (the Security
Treaty among Australia, New Zealand and the United States of America)[174]. In addition to annual ministerial
consultations among their foreign ministers and defense ministers, and joint exercises such as Talisman Saber,
Australia has dispatched warships, combat aircraft and special forces to the military operations in Iraq and the
war on terror in Afghanistan[175]. While the Rudd administration announced that it would withdraw combat troops
stationed in Iraq by mid-2008[176], it also announced that troops stationed in Afghanistan would remain there for
the long term. Thus, the close alliance is maintained[177].


-----

Australia decided to participate in the U.S.
led missile defense program in December 2003.
Although the concrete forms of participation remain
to be decided yet, Australia decided in August 2004
that it would adopt the U.S. Aegis system for its new
air defense destroyers. The possibility is indicated
that these destroyers will be applicable to ballistic
missile defense[178]. In addition, seeking to enhance
interoperability with the United States, with the
retirement of the F/A-18 Hornet and F-111 main
fighters in several years, in June 2002 Australia
announced that it would participate in the U.S.-led Australian military personnel in operation in Afghanistan [Australian Government,

Department of Defence]

F-35 Joint Strike Fighter Program. In preparation for
the delay in that program, in March 2007, it decided to
purchase F/A-18 Super Hornet[179], and is expanding U.S.-Australia joint exercise facilities in the country.

**2. Relations with Other Countries**
Australia is strengthening its partnership with NATO, primarily through its ISAF activities in Afghanistan. It
also conducts joint exercises with Malaysia, Singapore, the United Kingdom and New Zealand based on the Five
Power Defence Arrangements (which came into effect in 1971). In addition, Australia has taken part in U.N.
PKOs, such as the United Nations Integrated Mission in Timor-Leste (UNMIT).

As regards its relations with Indonesia, after the Bali terror bombings in 2002 and 2005, and the one that

occurred in front of the Australian Embassy in Jakarta in September 2004, the two countries decided to resume
suspended joint exercises between their special forces[180]. Furthermore, in November 2006, they signed a security
agreement for a broad defense cooperation including counterterrorism and intelligence.


-----

Section 8. Europe

**1. General Situation**
With the end of the Cold War, many European countries now recognize that the threat of large-scale invasion by
other countries has disappeared and regard the outbreak of regional conflict within and around Europe, the rise
of terrorism, the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction (WMD) and other developments as new security
challenges.

To adapt to new and emerging threats, Europe has sought to stabilize the security environment primarily

by strengthening and expanding the frameworks of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO: 26 member
states) and the European Union (EU: 27 member states). Moreover, many European countries are proceeding
with the development of their own capacity to cope with these new challenges. (See Fig. I-2-8-1)

**2. Enhancement and Enlargement of Security Frameworks**

**1. Enhancement of Conflict Prevention, Crisis Management and Peacekeeping Functions**

**(1) Commitment to a New Role**
Founded for the primary purpose of collective defense among member countries, NATO has shifted the focus of
its activities to conflict prevention and crisis management since the end of the Cold War.

This shift has also been reflected in the Strategic Concept of the Alliance, reviewed in 1999, in which NATO has

added including conflict prevention and crisis management[181] to its primary mission of collective defense, based
on the view that various dangers difficult to forecast, such as ethnic and religious conflicts, territorial disputes,
human rights suppression, and the dissolution of a state, still remain in Europe and surrounding regions.

NATO has led the International Security Assistance Force (ISAF) in Afghanistan since August 2003, which is

the first operation outside Europe, and expanded the area of its mission to all regions of Afghanistan in October
2006. As the demand remains for a strengthening of posture by ISAF, arguments have arisen concerning the
provision of additional troops and their regional allocation[182] among countries including the U.S., Canada, the
U.K. and the Netherlands, whose forces are deployed in the south and east where attacks are frequent, and
countries including Germany and France, whose forces operate in relatively stable areas of the north and west
and around Kabul. In April 2008, the Bucharest Declaration announced at the NATO Summit held in April 2008
commended the pledges of additional troops by member countries[183] while also expecting further additional
contributions, and stated that NATO would place the highest priority on ISAF’s mission.

In Iraq, NATO is providing assistance for the training of Iraqi security forces in accordance with the

agreement reached at the NATO Istanbul Summit Meeting held in April 2004, and NATO continues to conduct
peacekeeping operations in Kosovo, which declared independence in February of this year[184].

The EU, enhanced its own commitment to security issues, and adopted its first security strategy paper in

December 2003, titled “A Secure Europe in a Better World-European Security Strategy.” It sets forth the objective
of addressing major threats including terrorism, the proliferation of WMD, regional conflict, the collapse of
states and organized crime by stabilizing surrounding regions and through multinational cooperation.

In 2003, the EU led its first peacekeeping operation to maintain public order in Macedonia, employing NATO

equipment and capabilities[185]. In the same year, the EU carried out its first peacekeeping operation outside of
Europe, in the Democratic Republic of Congo—without the use of NATO equipment and capabilities. The EU
has since engaged, to a considerable degree, in crisis management and peacekeeping operations[186], continuing
the activities of the NATO-led Stabilization Force (SFOR) in Bosnia and Herzegovina in December 2004, and
deploying forces in Chad and Central Africa based on a decision made in October last year.

Notes: 1. The Warsaw Pact Military Organization was dissolved in April 1991. The Warsaw Pact was dissolved as a political organization after the signing of

the dissolution agreement on July 1, 1991 and ratification of the parliaments of the member states.

2. NATO leaders decided to invite Albania and Croatia to begin accession talks to join NATO at the NATO summit in April 2008. (They will officially be

admitted through processes such as ratification.)

**(2) Pursuit of Military Capabilities Required for New Roles**
NATO’s bombing campaign against Yugoslavia in 1999 revealed a capability gap between the United States and
European countries. Given this, and based on the agreement reached at the NATO Prague Summit Meeting in
November 2002, NATO has moved forward with the reforms of its military capabilities, including organizational
transformation[187].

At the core of the reforms of NATO’s capability improvements has been the development of the NATO

Response Force (NRF), which is designed to rapidly respond to various crisis scenarios around the world. The
Force was declared to be at full operational capacity in November 2006. However, with the expansion and
extension of troop deployments in Afghanistan and elsewhere, NATO is reconsidering the structure of the NRF


-----

so as to lessen the burden on countries contributing armed forces to the NRF.

Meanwhile, the EU has been making efforts to conduct peacekeeping and other military operations

independently in cases where NATO does not intervene. Since January 2007, the EU has made two Battle groups
fully ready at all times based on the Battle groups concept proclaimed in “Headline Goal 2010[188]” adopted in
2004. The EU also established its own operation center in Brussels in January 2007. (See Fig. I-2-8-2)

**2. Geographical Expansion and Partnership of Security Frameworks**
Since the end of the Cold War, efforts have been made to secure the stability of the so-called security vacuum in
Central and Eastern Europe by enlarging the NATO framework[189]. At present, most of the countries of Central
and Eastern Europe are NATO member states and have borders with Russia, which has consistently opposed
NATO’s expansion to the east.

At the same time, NATO has pursued a policy of partnership with non-NATO member countries. For example,

NATO adopted the Partnership for Peace (PfP)[190], which aims to foster confidence and improve interoperability
with non-NATO European countries, and the Mediterranean Dialogue (MD)[191], which seeks stability in the
Mediterranean region.

NATO is also strengthening relations with contact countries[192] such as Australia and Japan with a view to

conducting activities outside of the region.

Since the 9/11 terrorist attacks, NATO and Russia have sought to improve relations, and established the


-----

NATO-Russia Council (NRC) in 2002 in light of the need to deal with common issues concerning security.
NATO and Russia have continued to pursue dialogue and cooperation in areas such as the fight against terrorism,
arms control, and theater missile defense[193].

The number of EU member countries in Central and Eastern Europe is also expanding, with the accession of

10 countries in 2004, including Poland and the Czech Republic, and the accession of Bulgaria and Romania in
January of last year. (See Fig. I-2-8-3)

Note: NATO leaders decided to invite Albania and Croatia to begin accession talks to join NATO at the NATO summit in April 2008. (They will officially

become members through processes such as ratification.)

**3. Efforts by Individual Countries to Maintain the Capability to Respond to Various**

**Conditions**

Since the end of the Cold War, each individual country—conscious of the new threats of terrorism and the
proliferation of WMD—have begun to place emphasis on the allocation of personnel to missions other than
national defense. As a result, there has been an emphasis on strengthening transport capacity for overseas
deployment, giving consideration to the role of NATO and other defense organizations. Moreover, many
European countries have implemented quantitative reductions and restructuring of their military power, while
channeling efforts into modernizing their military and increasing national defense expenditures[194].

**1. The United Kingdom**
The U.K. has maintained the perception that it is not subject to any direct military threats and therefore has
pursued military reform focused on enhancing capacity in order to cope with new threats with the end of the Cold
War. In particular, the U.K. regarded international terrorism and the proliferation of WMD as major threats and
improved its overseas deployment capacity and readiness has been advanced[195].


-----

The first National Security Strategy of the United

Kingdom was announced in March of this year. The
strategy highlights the broadened view of national
security to include threats to individual citizens, and it
considers transnational crime, pandemics, and flooding,
etc., as threats along with terrorism and the spread of
WMD. It also cites factors such as climate change,
competition for energy, and poverty as the causes of
these threats. To cope with these diverse and interrelated
threats, the strategy takes a multilateral approach
through the U.N., EU and NATO while seeking the
cooperation not only of the military and the police, but Amphibious exercises by the NATO readiness units [NATO picture]
also the private sector and regional governments, with a
view to addressing threats at an early stage.

As outlined in the strategy, the international security environment has grown more complex and less

predictable in terms of state-led military threats, which existing assessments conclude cannot be expected in the
foreseeable future[196]. The strategy nevertheless states that while the reemergence of such threats in the long run
is unlikely, they cannot be discounted, and thus sets forth a policy for maintaining strong defense capabilities[197].
To be specific, the U.K. will give priority to the procurement of equipment for supporting its current operations,
including strategic airlift, support helicopters and protected patrol vehicles. At the same time, it realizes that a
complete rebuilding of its aircraft carriers, air defense and anti-submarine warfare will be difficult and therefore
plans to invest for the long term in a broad range of military capabilities related to the defense of the United
Kingdom. Furthermore, in a white paper, “The Future of the United Kingdom’s Nuclear Deterrence” issued in
December 2006, the U.K. announced it would maintain its own nuclear deterrence based on submarine-launched
ballistic missiles in the 2020s and beyond[198].

These military capabilities will guarantee the United Kingdom’s future security while enabling it to

make contributions to international efforts on peacekeeping and thus contribute to the international security
environment.

**2. Germany**
In its first national defense white paper in 12 years issued in October 2006, Germany specified that the primary
mission of its allied forces remains national defense and collective defense in the traditional sense. In light of
the expansion of new threats including terrorism and the spread of WMD, however, it declared that conflict
prevention and crisis management, including the fight against terrorism, would likely become the next mission.

To ensure the necessary military capabilities to meet the above mission, Germany plans to give priority in

resource distribution to strengthening strategic transport capacity, global reconnaissance capabilities and efficient
command capabilities with high interoperability. Specifically, Germany plans to introduce the A-400M transport
aircraft and SAR-LUPE, a synthetic aperture radar satellite. It is also restructuring its military into integrated
units divided by function: intervention, stabilization and assistance[199], while reducing personnel and relocating
its domestic camps and facilities.

**3. France**
In June 2008, France announced “The White Paper on Defense and National Security,” its first in 14 years, which
outlines the country’s medium- to long-term defense and national security strategy. In addition to specifying the
direct threats of mass terrorism and ballistic missiles, the report also identifies risks ranging from cyberattacks


-----

to environmental crises, stating that these threats and risks were becoming increasingly interconnected due to
globalization and that the continuity between domestic and foreign security has taken on strategic significance.
The regions cited as affecting the stability of France and Europe included the area extending from the Atlantic
to the Indian oceans, sub-Saharan Africa, Eastern Europe and Asia, which, is growing in its importance. The
report specifies three statues of France’s national security strategy: prevention, nuclear deterrence[200] protection,
and overseas intervention, based on accurate knowledge and anticipation of conditions in a world characterized
by uncertainty and instability. The report states that France will strengthen these functions and combine them
flexibly in order to adapt to changes in the strategic environment over the next 15 years.

Regarding France’s external relations, the report calls for a strengthening of EU security and renovation of

transatlantic relations, and advocates full participation in NATO[201] in view of the altered situation existing since
France’s withdrawal from NATO’s military structure and, in particular, the complementary relationship between
the EU and NATO. The Defense and National Security Council chaired by the French President with specialized
bodies including the National Intelligence Council will be established in France.

With respect to the provision of military power, France intends to meet operational requirements such as

enhancing protection capabilities while, at the same time, reducing personnel, and to proceed with a strengthening
of its intelligence functions and a modernization of its military equipment.

**4. Efforts toward Stabilization in Europe**

**1. Arms Control and Disarmament**
The Treaty of Conventional Armed Forces in Europe (CFE), which formally entered into force in 1992, set upper
limits for five categories of weapons, namely tanks, wheeled armored combat vehicles, artillery, fighters and
attack helicopters, for both the East and West[202]. By reducing weapons exceeding these limits, the treaty sought
to preclude the capability for launching surprise attacks or large-scale invasions and thereby ensure the safety
and stability of Europe.

The disbanding of the Warsaw Pact Organization (WPO) and NATO’s enlargement to the east led to the

signing of the CFE Treaty at the 1999 OSCE Summit Meeting. The principal aims of this treaty were a change of
the existing restrictions on arms possession imposed separately for the East and the West groups to restrictions by
country or territory. However, the NATO countries are considering abandoning ratification of the treaty because
Russia failed to withdraw its army from Moldova and Georgia as it had agreed to do when it signed the treaty.

In response, Russia, coupled with its reaction to the U.S. Missile Defense Plan in Eastern Europe, suspended

its participation in the CFE Treaty from December of last year, and stopped on-site inspections to verify
compliance with numerical limits.

**2. Confidence Building Measures (CBM)[203]**

Talks on Confidence and Security-Building Measures (CSBM) negotiations have been held in Europe since
1989, and at the 1992 Conference on Security and Cooperation in Europe (CSCE), the Vienna Document 1992,
which specified annual exchange of military information along with notifications, inspections and restrictions
concerning military exercises exceeding a certain scale, was adopted[204].

The Open Skies Treaty[205], designed to improve openness and transparency of military activities carried out

by signatory countries through mutual inspection flights and also supplement arms control verification measures,
was signed by 25 countries in 1992 and entered into force in January 2002.


-----

Section 7. Australia

**1. National Defense Policy**
Australia, like Japan and the Republic of Korea, is allied with the United States. Australia has been broadly and
actively involved in resolving security issues in the Middle East and Asia-Pacific region in addition to those in
neighboring areas such as Timor-Leste and the Solomon Islands. (See Part III, Chapter 3, Section 2)

In December 2000, Australia announced “Defence 2000 - Our Future Defence Force,” which set forth its

defense policy for the coming decade. The document states that the missions of the Australian Defence Force
(ADF) are: first, to defend Australia; second, to contribute to the security of its immediate neighborhood; and
third, to contribute effectively to international coalitions of forces to meet crises beyond Australia’s immediate
neighborhood in support of Australia’s wider interests and objectives.

In order to respond to subsequent changes in the strategic environment, the Howard administration[170] reviewed

the national defense strategy approximately every two years, and the results were announced as “Australia’s
National Security: A Defence Update.”

“A Defence Update” issued in February 2003, which took into account the 9/11 terrorist attacks and the

bombing in Bali, Indonesia, in October 2002, designated terrorism, proliferation of weapons of mass destruction,
and failing states as priority issues for responding to the new strategic environment resulting from progressing
globalization, and predicted an increase in opportunities for ADF activities in remote regions.

“A Defence Update” issued in December 2005, taking into account the ADF’s participation in the military

operation in Iraq that began in March 2005 and the subsequent reconstruction activities, the Regional Assistance
Mission to the Solomon Islands (RAMSI) activities that began in July 2005[171], as well as terrorist acts in many
parts of the world, indicated the importance of the government’s integrated efforts to respond to increasingly
complex and diverse situations.

“A Defence Update” issued in July 2007, taking into account factors such as the ADF involvement in the

Middle East to that point, the dispatch of the ADF to the uprising in Timor-Leste[172], and nuclear issues in North
Korea and Iran[173], stated that the priority issues laid out in the above-mentioned 2003 report would remain in effect.
The report expected that the situation will continue where the ADF, while continuing activities in neighboring
regions, engages in activities in coalition with foreign forces in remote regions, including Iraq and Afghanistan.
In this way, the ADF aims to make a meaningful contribution to international security issues in remote regions, as
well as to take a leadership role in the neighboring region, which comprises many unstable island states. For all
of these activities, a high readiness posture is required. The report also mentions that although it remains unlikely
that Australia will face conventional military threats, in order to allow the country to independently defend
its territory without relying on the assistance of other countries in case of such an unlikely event occurring, it
continues to be of great importance to retain an edge in leading military capability in the region.

**2. Foreign Relations**

**1. Relations with the United States**
Australia attaches importance to its alliance with the United States based on the ANZUS Treaty (the Security
Treaty among Australia, New Zealand and the United States of America)[174]. In addition to annual ministerial
consultations among their foreign ministers and defense ministers, and joint exercises such as Talisman Saber,
Australia has dispatched warships, combat aircraft and special forces to the military operations in Iraq and the
war on terror in Afghanistan[175]. While the Rudd administration announced that it would withdraw combat troops
stationed in Iraq by mid-2008[176], it also announced that troops stationed in Afghanistan would remain there for
the long term. Thus, the close alliance is maintained[177].


-----

Australia decided to participate in the U.S.
led missile defense program in December 2003.
Although the concrete forms of participation remain
to be decided yet, Australia decided in August 2004
that it would adopt the U.S. Aegis system for its new
air defense destroyers. The possibility is indicated
that these destroyers will be applicable to ballistic
missile defense[178]. In addition, seeking to enhance
interoperability with the United States, with the
retirement of the F/A-18 Hornet and F-111 main
fighters in several years, in June 2002 Australia
announced that it would participate in the U.S.-led Australian military personnel in operation in Afghanistan [Australian Government,

Department of Defence]

F-35 Joint Strike Fighter Program. In preparation for
the delay in that program, in March 2007, it decided to
purchase F/A-18 Super Hornet[179], and is expanding U.S.-Australia joint exercise facilities in the country.

**2. Relations with Other Countries**
Australia is strengthening its partnership with NATO, primarily through its ISAF activities in Afghanistan. It
also conducts joint exercises with Malaysia, Singapore, the United Kingdom and New Zealand based on the Five
Power Defence Arrangements (which came into effect in 1971). In addition, Australia has taken part in U.N.
PKOs, such as the United Nations Integrated Mission in Timor-Leste (UNMIT).

As regards its relations with Indonesia, after the Bali terror bombings in 2002 and 2005, and the one that

occurred in front of the Australian Embassy in Jakarta in September 2004, the two countries decided to resume
suspended joint exercises between their special forces[180]. Furthermore, in November 2006, they signed a security
agreement for a broad defense cooperation including counterterrorism and intelligence.


-----

Section 8. Europe

**1. General Situation**
With the end of the Cold War, many European countries now recognize that the threat of large-scale invasion by
other countries has disappeared and regard the outbreak of regional conflict within and around Europe, the rise
of terrorism, the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction (WMD) and other developments as new security
challenges.

To adapt to new and emerging threats, Europe has sought to stabilize the security environment primarily

by strengthening and expanding the frameworks of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO: 26 member
states) and the European Union (EU: 27 member states). Moreover, many European countries are proceeding
with the development of their own capacity to cope with these new challenges. (See Fig. I-2-8-1)

**2. Enhancement and Enlargement of Security Frameworks**

**1. Enhancement of Conflict Prevention, Crisis Management and Peacekeeping Functions**

**(1) Commitment to a New Role**
Founded for the primary purpose of collective defense among member countries, NATO has shifted the focus of
its activities to conflict prevention and crisis management since the end of the Cold War.

This shift has also been reflected in the Strategic Concept of the Alliance, reviewed in 1999, in which NATO has

added including conflict prevention and crisis management[181] to its primary mission of collective defense, based
on the view that various dangers difficult to forecast, such as ethnic and religious conflicts, territorial disputes,
human rights suppression, and the dissolution of a state, still remain in Europe and surrounding regions.

NATO has led the International Security Assistance Force (ISAF) in Afghanistan since August 2003, which is

the first operation outside Europe, and expanded the area of its mission to all regions of Afghanistan in October
2006. As the demand remains for a strengthening of posture by ISAF, arguments have arisen concerning the
provision of additional troops and their regional allocation[182] among countries including the U.S., Canada, the
U.K. and the Netherlands, whose forces are deployed in the south and east where attacks are frequent, and
countries including Germany and France, whose forces operate in relatively stable areas of the north and west
and around Kabul. In April 2008, the Bucharest Declaration announced at the NATO Summit held in April 2008
commended the pledges of additional troops by member countries[183] while also expecting further additional
contributions, and stated that NATO would place the highest priority on ISAF’s mission.

In Iraq, NATO is providing assistance for the training of Iraqi security forces in accordance with the

agreement reached at the NATO Istanbul Summit Meeting held in April 2004, and NATO continues to conduct
peacekeeping operations in Kosovo, which declared independence in February of this year[184].

The EU, enhanced its own commitment to security issues, and adopted its first security strategy paper in

December 2003, titled “A Secure Europe in a Better World-European Security Strategy.” It sets forth the objective
of addressing major threats including terrorism, the proliferation of WMD, regional conflict, the collapse of
states and organized crime by stabilizing surrounding regions and through multinational cooperation.

In 2003, the EU led its first peacekeeping operation to maintain public order in Macedonia, employing NATO

equipment and capabilities[185]. In the same year, the EU carried out its first peacekeeping operation outside of
Europe, in the Democratic Republic of Congo—without the use of NATO equipment and capabilities. The EU
has since engaged, to a considerable degree, in crisis management and peacekeeping operations[186], continuing
the activities of the NATO-led Stabilization Force (SFOR) in Bosnia and Herzegovina in December 2004, and
deploying forces in Chad and Central Africa based on a decision made in October last year.

the dissolution agreement on July 1, 1991 and ratification of the parliaments of the member states.

2. NATO leaders decided to invite Albania and Croatia to begin accession talks to join NATO at the NATO summit in April 2008. (They will officially be

admitted through processes such as ratification.)

**(2) Pursuit of Military Capabilities Required for New Roles**
NATO’s bombing campaign against Yugoslavia in 1999 revealed a capability gap between the United States and
European countries. Given this, and based on the agreement reached at the NATO Prague Summit Meeting in
November 2002, NATO has moved forward with the reforms of its military capabilities, including organizational
transformation[187].

At the core of the reforms of NATO’s capability improvements has been the development of the NATO

Response Force (NRF), which is designed to rapidly respond to various crisis scenarios around the world. The
Force was declared to be at full operational capacity in November 2006. However, with the expansion and
extension of troop deployments in Afghanistan and elsewhere, NATO is reconsidering the structure of the NRF


-----

so as to lessen the burden on countries contributing armed forces to the NRF.

Meanwhile, the EU has been making efforts to conduct peacekeeping and other military operations

independently in cases where NATO does not intervene. Since January 2007, the EU has made two Battle groups
fully ready at all times based on the Battle groups concept proclaimed in “Headline Goal 2010[188]” adopted in
2004. The EU also established its own operation center in Brussels in January 2007. (See Fig. I-2-8-2)

**2. Geographical Expansion and Partnership of Security Frameworks**
Since the end of the Cold War, efforts have been made to secure the stability of the so-called security vacuum in
Central and Eastern Europe by enlarging the NATO framework[189]. At present, most of the countries of Central
and Eastern Europe are NATO member states and have borders with Russia, which has consistently opposed
NATO’s expansion to the east.

At the same time, NATO has pursued a policy of partnership with non-NATO member countries. For example,

NATO adopted the Partnership for Peace (PfP)[190], which aims to foster confidence and improve interoperability
with non-NATO European countries, and the Mediterranean Dialogue (MD)[191], which seeks stability in the
Mediterranean region.

NATO is also strengthening relations with contact countries[192] such as Australia and Japan with a view to

conducting activities outside of the region.

Since the 9/11 terrorist attacks, NATO and Russia have sought to improve relations, and established the


-----

NATO-Russia Council (NRC) in 2002 in light of the need to deal with common issues concerning security.
NATO and Russia have continued to pursue dialogue and cooperation in areas such as the fight against terrorism,
arms control, and theater missile defense[193].

The number of EU member countries in Central and Eastern Europe is also expanding, with the accession of

10 countries in 2004, including Poland and the Czech Republic, and the accession of Bulgaria and Romania in
January of last year. (See Fig. I-2-8-3)

These military capabilities will guarantee the United Kingdom’s future security while enabling it to

make contributions to international efforts on peacekeeping and thus contribute to the international security

aircraft and SAR-LUPE, a synthetic aperture radar satellite. It is also restructuring its military into integrated
units divided by function: intervention, stabilization and assistance[199], while reducing personnel and relocating
its domestic camps and facilities.

**3. France**
In June 2008, France announced “The White Paper on Defense and National Security,” its first in 14 years, which
outlines the country’s medium- to long-term defense and national security strategy. In addition to specifying the
direct threats of mass terrorism and ballistic missiles, the report also identifies risks ranging from cyberattacks

to environmental crises, stating that these threats and risks were becoming increasingly interconnected due to
globalization and that the continuity between domestic and foreign security has taken on strategic significance.
The regions cited as affecting the stability of France and Europe included the area extending from the Atlantic

France’s withdrawal from NATO’s military structure and, in particular, the complementary relationship between

With respect to the provision of military power, France intends to meet operational requirements such as

enhancing protection capabilities while, at the same time, reducing personnel, and to proceed with a strengthening
of its intelligence functions and a modernization of its military equipment.

**4. Efforts toward Stabilization in Europe**

**1. Arms Control and Disarmament**
The Treaty of Conventional Armed Forces in Europe (CFE), which formally entered into force in 1992, set upper
limits for five categories of weapons, namely tanks, wheeled armored combat vehicles, artillery, fighters and
attack helicopters, for both the East and West[202]. By reducing weapons exceeding these limits, the treaty sought
to preclude the capability for launching surprise attacks or large-scale invasions and thereby ensure the safety
and stability of Europe.

The disbanding of the Warsaw Pact Organization (WPO) and NATO’s enlargement to the east led to the

signing of the CFE Treaty at the 1999 OSCE Summit Meeting. The principal aims of this treaty were a change of
the existing restrictions on arms possession imposed separately for the East and the West groups to restrictions by
country or territory. However, the NATO countries are considering abandoning ratification of the treaty because
Russia failed to withdraw its army from Moldova and Georgia as it had agreed to do when it signed the treaty.

In response, Russia, coupled with its reaction to the U.S. Missile Defense Plan in Eastern Europe, suspended

its participation in the CFE Treaty from December of last year, and stopped on-site inspections to verify
compliance with numerical limits.

**2. Confidence Building Measures (CBM)[203]**

Talks on Confidence and Security-Building Measures (CSBM) negotiations have been held in Europe since
1989, and at the 1992 Conference on Security and Cooperation in Europe (CSCE), the Vienna Document 1992,
which specified annual exchange of military information along with notifications, inspections and restrictions
concerning military exercises exceeding a certain scale, was adopted[204].

The Open Skies Treaty[205], designed to improve openness and transparency of military activities carried out

by signatory countries through mutual inspection flights and also supplement arms control verification measures,
was signed by 25 countries in 1992 and entered into force in January 2002.

Section 9. Efforts to Stabilize the International Community by the U.N. and Other

Scheme

**1. General Situation**
The end of the Cold War was accompanied by rising expectations for the peacekeeping system by the U.N.,
which up to that time had not functioned adequately, and as a result, many U.N. Peacekeeping Operations (PKOs)
were established. In recent years, efforts through regional frameworks such as the European Union (EU) and the
African Union (AU) have been formed as a means of dealing appropriately with conflict (See Chapter 1). Other
efforts include peacekeeping operations and humanitarian and reconstruction assistance by multinational forces
mandated by U.N. Security Council Resolutions (See Chapter 1). Efforts aimed not only at peacekeeping but also
at conflict prevention and peacebuilding[206] are also increasing.

**2. Developments in U.N. Peacekeeping Operations (PKOs)**
Traditionally, PKOs have mainly aimed at preventing reoccurrence of conflict by focusing on monitoring
of ceasefires and other tasks after a ceasefire agreement has been reached. Since the end of the Cold War,
however, the missions now cover a broad range of operations, including civilian activities such as monitoring
of disarmament, monitoring of elections and administration, and humanitarian support for return of refugees. In
addition, operations with strong mandates[207] under Chapter VII of the U.N. Charter can now be established[208].

The scale of participants in these operations has been marking remarkable increase. The number of personnel

dispatched has increased substantially since the end of the Cold War, and in 1993, when large-scale PKO missions
were on the move in the Balkan Peninsula and Somalia, the number reached a record of approximately 78,000.
Subsequently, the number temporarily reduced to 12,000, but from around 2000, it has begun to rise again due
to an increase in large-scale missions mainly in Africa and the Middle East[209]. As of the end of May 2008, 17
PKO missions were being conducted in 117 countries with about 88,000 participants around the world[210]. (See
Fig. I-2-9-1)

However, the environment surrounding PKOs in recent years has grown increasingly harsh. Missions

dispatched to regions without social infrastructure have increased, and the proportion of PKO personnel fatalities
due to illness to the total PKO death toll is increasing[211]. This situation makes it difficult to gather personnel and
equipment and to ensure the safety of personnel.

**3. Organizational Reform of the U.N.**
Last year, a number of key measures were taken in the area of organizational reform of the U.N.

To deal with the circumstances concerning PKOs described above, the Department of Field Support, which

is responsible for personnel affairs, budget and finance, logistics, and other affairs of PKOs, was established in
June by separating a part of the functions of the Department of Peacekeeping Operations in order to strengthen
the U.N. Secretariat’s capabilities for PKO operation and maintenance.

In October, strengthening the Department of Political Affairs was proposed with a view to improving

preventive diplomacy and good offices of the U.N. The report by the U.N. Secretary-General concerning this
proposal positioned conflict prevention alongside peacekeeping as a pillar of peace and security efforts and
called for the building-up of the capacity of the Department’s regional offices and an increase in budget and
personnel.

Furthermore, the Department of Disarmament Affairs, which is responsible for disarmament and non
proliferation, was reorganized as the Office for Disarmament Affairs last year.

**Notes:**
1) While the U.S. President is required to submit the National Security Strategy to Congress every year in
accordance with Section 404a, title 50 of the United States Code, the release of the National Security
Strategy in 2006 was the second submission by the Bush administration following the one in September
2002.
2) The QDR is a document that the Secretary of Defense is required to submit to Congress every four years
according to Section 118, title 10 of the United States Code. It foresees the security environment in the next
20 years and clarifies issues including the National Defense Strategy, force structure, force modernization
plan, defense infrastructure, and budget plan. The release of the 2006 QDR is the second submission by the
Bush administration following the one in September 2001.
3) The National Defense Strategy is a document released by the Secretary of Defense in March 2005 as a guide
to implementing the National Security Strategy as well as the basis of the QDR published in March 2006.
On July 31, 2008, U.S. Defense Secretary Gates released the new National Defense Strategy, which reflects
the results of 2006 QDR.
4) The Transformation Planning Guidance (April 2003) defines transformation as “a process that shapes
the changing nature of military competition and cooperation through new combinations of concepts,
capabilities, people and organizations that exploit our nation’s advantages and protect against our asymmetric
vulnerabilities to sustain our strategic position, which helps underpin peace and stability in the world.”
5) The National Defense Strategy describes that as desirable strategic targets are not always attainable while
attainable strategic targets are sometimes not worth the costs, there can be trade-off between strategic targets
and scarce defense resources. Therefore, as stated in the 2001 QDR, it notes that the following four risks that
are difficult to respond to at the same time should be controlled carefully:

(1) Operational Risks: Risks associated with the capacity to execute future missions successfully against an

array of prospective future challenges.

(2) Future Challenge Risks: Risks associated with the capacity to execute future missions successfully

against an array of prospective future challenges.

(3) Force Management Risks: Risks associated with managing military forces in the areas of recruiting,

retaining, training and readiness.

(4) Institutional Risks: Risks associated with the capacity of new command, management, and business

practices.
6) The Striker Brigade Combat Team is formed as a light unit so that it can be deployed anywhere in the world
promptly by C-130 transport aircraft and other transportation means. Unlike heavily armed conventional
mechanized divisions, the team is equipped with “Striker,” 8-wheel-drive armored vehicles that are loaded
with 105mm guns and other weapons and are characterized by strike assets and mobility.
7) In April 2005, then Commander of U.S. Army Europe Bell announced plans to reduce soldiers spread over
13 main operating locations across Europe to approximately 24,000 soldiers concentrated among four Joint
Main Operating Bases (JMOB), which would take place over the next 5 to 10 years.
8) News briefing with Secretary of the Army Geren and Vice Chief of Staff of the Army Cody (December 19,
2007).
9) In March 2007 the United States announced that one aircraft carrier would be transferred returning from
service in the Atlantic to a Pacific base in San Diego in early 2010.
10) According to the congressional testimony in September 2004 of Admiral Fargo, Commander of the U.S.

Pacific Command, U.S. forces deploy bombers in Guam by rotation.
11) White House Fact Sheet (August 16, 2004).


-----

12) U.S. Africa Command is expected to start full operations as a separate unified Command no later than

September 30, 2008. However, the U.S. has announced that it does not contemplate to add military bases in
Africa.
13) Joint press conference by U.S. President Bush and President Kufor of Ghana (February 20, 2008).
14) As for non-strategic nuclear forces, the Nuclear Posture Review announced by the Clinton administration

in September 1994 states as follows: (1) Eliminate the option to deploy nuclear weapons on carrier-based,
dual-capable (nuclear/conventional) aircraft; (2) Eliminate the option to carry nuclear Tomahawk cruise
missiles (TLAM/N) on surface ships: (3) Retain the option to deploy TLAM/N on attack submarines; and
(4) Retain the current commitment of dual-capable aircraft based in Europe and Continental United States
(CONUS) and the deployment of nuclear weapons in Europe.
15) In addition, this Act stipulates the establishment of the Congressional Commission on the Strategic Posture

of the U.S. composed of members designated by Congress, and calls for a review of strategic postures,
including nuclear weapons policy, with a report to be submitted to the President and Congress no later than
December 1, 2008.
16) The $70 billion allocated in the FY 2009 Defense Budget for fighting terrorism is described as a “bridge

fund.” The breakdown of major budgetary items under this fund is explained as follows: $45.1 billion for
combat operations in Iraq and Afghanistan, $3.7 billion for expanding Afghan security forces, $2 billion
for training for Iraqi security forces, $1.7 billion for Commander’s Emergency Response Program (CERP)
in Iraq and Afghanistan, and $4 billion in transfer authority to the Secretary of Defense as well as for other
international operations.
17) Although specific reduction volumes are unclear, it is stated that the U.S. nuclear stockpile would be less

than one-quarter of its size at the end of the Cold War.
18) In the organizational reform of the U.S. Army, its conventional pyramid structure (army, corps, divisions,

and brigades) will be reorganized into the headquarters with command and control functions and selfsufficient combat units (the size of a brigade) so that it can respond to various situations promptly and
flexibly by combining headquarters and working units according to the purpose and scale of the mission.
19) Its headquarters is located at Camp Lejuene in North Carolina. As the Marine Corps Special Operation

Command was created, the 4th Marine Expeditionary Brigade was deactivated.
20) With regard to conflict response in regions other than Iraq and Afghanistan, then Chairman of the Joint Chiefs

of Staff General Peter Pace stated that even while operations were being carried out in the abovementioned
dual theaters, the U.S. still had enormous air and sea capacity as well as large numbers of ground forces that
were not currently employed in the Gulf, and that none of their potential enemies should miscalculate the
capacity of the U.S. to generate this overwhelming combat power in order to defend its national interests.
On the other hand, he also pointed out that the best equipment is left at the frontlines and equipment that
is worn out or damaged is returned to the U.S., which makes the units at home not as fully equipped as
they could be. Additionally, he stated that as precision weapons are being used in a concentrated manner in
both theaters of war, if a response was required in another theater, there could be a situation in which U.S.
forces would use “brute force” with non-precision weapons that impose greater collateral damage. (Press
conference, October 24, 2006.)
21) The 4th Fleet was once disestablished in 1950, and taken over by the 2nd Fleet, but in order to address

the increased role of maritime forces in Southern Command area of operations and to demonstrate U.S.
commitment to regional partners, the 4th Fleet was reestablished. (Announcement by Chief of Naval
Operations, April 24, 2008.)
22) The C-17 is a large cargo aircraft with excellent takeoff and landing capabilities that can transport about 70

tons of goods to a front-line base located more than 4,000km away. C-5 aircraft with a cargo load of about


-----

120 tons can fly approximately 4,000km, offload, and fly to a second base another 900km away from the
original destination.
23) Russia is opposed to the deployment of the MD system, insisting that it will have a negative impact on

the country’s nuclear deterrent capability, and this opposition was also noted in the U.S.-Russia Strategic
Framework Declaration in April 2008. The United States, however, in a move to ease the concerns of the
Russia side, has explained that the target of the MD system is not Russia: it will be deployed to defend
Europe and other allies from missile threats posed by Iran.
24) China implemented an experiment to destroy one of its own satellites in low earth orbit, approximately

850km from earth in January 2007, without giving prior notice. In the U.S. Department of Defense Annual
Report to Congress, “Military Power of the People’s Republic of China” (May 2007), the following is stated
with regard to the Chinese experiment: “The test raised the resulting debris cloud and put at risk the assets
of all space faring nations and posed dangers to human space flight due to the creation of an unprecedented
amount of debris.”

On the other hand, in February 2008 the U.S. government gave prior notice of a plan to shoot down a U.S.
national reconnaissance office satellite which was out of control with hazardous fuel still on board. Later
that month a specially modified Aegis ship in the Pacific Ocean fired a standard missile 3 (SM-3) at the
satellite and broke it up successfully. The United States stated that with regard to the interception, due to the
relatively low altitude of the satellite at the time of the engagement (approximately 247km), debris would
begin to re-enter the earth’s atmosphere immediately. Nearly all of the debris would burn upon re-entry
within a few days and the remaining debris should re-enter within a few weeks.
25) The figure of U.S. military mentioned in this paragraph is the number of active personnel recorded on

the publication source of the U.S. Department of Defense, and it could change in accordance to unit
deployment.
26) Joint editorial of the Korean Workers’ Party’s journals “Rodong Shinmun” and “Workers” (June 16, 1999).
27) In North Korea, it seems that various military decisions are made by the National Defense Commission

(Chairman Kim Jong Il), which has the ultimate military authority, and the Ministry of People’s Armed
Forces (corresponding to the Ministry of Defense in other countries) is controlled not by the cabinet but by
the National Defense Commission.
28) The approximate percentage of active service members in total population is 0.2% in Japan, 0.5% in the

United States, 0.7% in Russia, and 1.4% in the ROK.
29) White House Press Secretary Dana Perino announced in a statement on April 24, 2008 that North Korea had

assisted Syria’s covert nuclear activities. In addition, Lieutenant General Michael D. Maples, Director of the
Defense Intelligence Agency (DIA), stated at the Senate Armed Services Committee in February 2008 that
North Korea may “have proliferated nuclear weapons-related technology abroad.”
30) Generally, missiles based on a solid fuel propellant system are considered to be militarily superior to those

based on a liquid propellant system because they are capable of immediate launches with their fuel stored in
airframes beforehand and they are easy to store and handle.
31) On October 27, 2006, as a result of the independently collected information and its analysis as well as our

careful examination of the U.S. and the ROK analyses, the Japanese government judged that the probability
that North Korea had conducted a nuclear test was extremely high.
32) In this framework, measures that the United States and North Korea should take are shown, including North

Korea’s remaining as a member of the NPT.
33) A nuclear reactor that uses graphite as a moderator.
34) Nuclear fuel rods used in operation of nuclear reactors contain plutonium, which can be extracted by

reprocessing the rods.

35) The second and third rounds of the Six-Party Talks were held in February and June 2004 respectively, the

fourth round from July to August and in September 2005, and the fifth round in November 2005, December
2006, and February 2007. The sixth round was held in March and September 2007.
36) General Burwell B. Bell, Commander of U.S. Forces Korea, stated at the House Armed Services Committee

in March 2008 that “Currently, the intelligence community assesses that North Korea extracted plutonium
at its Yongbyon nuclear facility and possesses weapons-grade plutonium sufficient for several nuclear
devices.”
37) In his statement to the Senate Armed Services Committee in February 2008, Lieutenant General Maples,

Director of the DIA, stated that “North Korea may be able to successfully mate a nuclear warhead to a
mobile ballistic missile.”
38) In his statement to the Senate Armed Services Committee in February 2008, Lieutenant General Maples,

Director of the DIA, stated that “North Korea has had a longstanding chemical warfare program,” “We
believe that Pyongyang possesses a sizeable stockpile of agents,” and that “This biological infrastructure
combined with its weapons industry give North Korea a potentially robust biological warfare capability.”
Also, the ROK Defense White Paper published in December 2006 pointed out that “It is believed that
approximately 2,500 to 5,000 tons of a variety of agents, including nerve agents, remain stored in a number
of facilities scattered around the country and that North Korea is able to produce biological weapons such
as the bacteria of anthrax, smallpox and cholera.”
39) The ranges of Scud B and Scud C missiles are estimated to be about 300km and 500km, respectively.
40) North Korea admits that it is exporting ballistic missiles to earn foreign currency. (Comment by the Korean

Central News Agency (KCNA) on June 16, 1998, and statement made by a North Korean foreign ministry
spokesman on December 13, 2002, reported by KCNA on the same day.)

41) In his statement to the House Armed Services Committee in March 2008, then General Bell, Commander,

U.S. Forces Korea, stated that “Preparations are underway to field a new intermediate range missile capable
of striking Okinawa, Guam and Alaska.” Also, in his statement to the same committee in March 2007,
General Bell stated that “North Korea is developing a new solid propellant short-range ballistic missile,
which it last successfully test-fired in March 2006. Once operational, this missile will be more mobile, more
rapidly deployable, and more capable of being launched on shorter notice than current systems.”
42) For example, a two-stage missile may be converted into a three-stage missile by installing a propulsion

device at the warhead.
43) For example, Director of National Intelligence J. Michael McConnell stated at the Senate Armed Services

Committee in February 2008 that “North Korea has already sold ballistic missiles to several Middle Eastern
countries and to Iran.” In addition, it has also been pointed out that North Korea has test-launched missiles
that it had exported in Iran and Pakistan and subsequently utilized the data.
44) Four Military Guidelines were adopted at the fifth Plenum of the fourth Korean Workers’ Party’s Central

Committee in 1962.
45) Covert operations to infiltrate enemy’s territories by dispersed small units.
46) Reportedly, North Korea has two types of special operations forces: one under the military forces and the

other under the Korean Workers’ Party. For example, the operation department of the Party is said to be in
charge of transporting agents.
47) For example, in April 2007, a large-scale military parade including the march of missile units was held to

celebrate the 75th anniversary of the Korean People’s Army with attendance of Kim Jong Il, Chairman of
the National Defense Commission.
48) In April 2008, the U.N. Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) estimated that North Korea’s production

of crops would be approximately 3 million tons, 750,000 tons lower than the past five-year average. It also


-----

estimated that shortfall of crops as of October would amount to 1.66 million tons.
49) It is pointed out that, due to the implementation of these new measures, the following problems have

occurred or signs of such problems have been observed in some areas: acceleration of inflation as a result of
simultaneous raising of wages and commodity prices despite unsolved shortage of commodities, widening
of income gaps, and increasing dissatisfaction with the regime due to information inflows.
50) The Country Reports on Terrorism 2007 published in April 2008 states that “As part of the Six-Party

Talks process, the United States reaffirmed its intent to fulfill its commitments regarding the removal
of the designation of the DPRK as a state sponsor of terrorism in parallel with the DPRK’s actions on
denuclearization and in accordance with criteria set forth in U.S. law.”
51) On June 26, 2008, after North Korea submitted the declaration of its nuclear programs, U.S. President Bush

sent over to the Congress the formal notification of his intent to remove the DPRK from the list of state
sponsors of terrorism.
52) The previous treaty contained the provision that if either of the signatories (Russia and North Korea)

was attacked, the other would immediately provide military and other assistance by any means. This
provision, however, was excluded from the new treaty.
53) The United States and the ROK have been operating the U.S.-ROK Combined Forces Command since 1978

in order to run the U.S.-ROK joint defense system to deter wars on the Korean Peninsula and to perform
effective joint operations in case of emergency. Under the U.S.-ROK joint defense system, the operational
control authority over ROK forces is to be exercised by the Chairman of the Korea Joint Chiefs of Staff in
peacetime and by the Commander of U.S. Forces Korea, who also serves as Commander of the Combined
Forces Command, in wartime.
54) The ROK Defense White Paper 2006 described North Korea as follows: “North Korea’s conventional

military capabilities, nuclear tests, weapons of mass destruction, and forward military deployment pose
serious threats to our national security.”
55) A KSS-II submarine equipped with Air Independent Propulsion (AIP) system was put into service in

December 2007 and a large transport vessel with 14,000 tons of displacement was commissioned in July
2007.
56) The name of the exercise was changed from “Reception, Staging, Onward Movement and Integration

(RSOI)” to “Key Resolve” this year.
57) “Scientific Development Concept” chiefly consists of “adhering to standardized plans and consideration

for all perspectives, maintaining a people-oriented position of establishing comprehensive, balanced
and sustainable development concept and the need to promote complete economic, social, and human
development.” (As commented by President Hu Jintao at Third Plenary Session of the 16th Central
Committee of the Communist Party of China in October 2003)

The construction of a “harmonious society” is defined as a process to continue dissolving social inconsistencies.
The “Resolution on Major Issues Regarding the Building of a Harmonious Socialist Society,” adopted at the
Sixth Plenary Session of the 16th Central Committee of the Communist Party of China in October 2006.
58) The term “responsible stakeholder” has been quoted in various U.S. Government documents after then

Deputy Secretary of State Robert B. Zoellick used the term in a speech in New York in September 2005.
The National Security Strategy, published in March 2006, states that, “As China becomes a global player,
it must act as a responsible stakeholder that fulfills its obligations and works with the United States and
others to advance the international system that has enabled its success: enforcing the international rules that
have helped China lift itself out of a century of economic deprivation, embracing the economic and political
standards that go along with that system of rules, and contributing to international stability and security by
working with the United States and other major powers.”

60) United States Department of Defense “Annual Report on Military Power of the People’s Republic of China”

(March 2008)
61) Testimony given by then Deputy Undersecretary Richard Lawless at the U.S.-China Economic and Security

Review Commission in February 2007.
62) Regarding the military sector, this treaty mentions holding discussions in the event that there is awareness

of military confidence building or strengthening of mutual troop reductions in border territories, military
cooperation such as military technical cooperation, or any threat to peace.
63) Established in China, Russia, and four Central Asian countries (Uzbekistan, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, and

Tajikistan) in June 2001. This organization promotes cooperation between various countries in a vast range
of sectors, including security, politics, culture, and energy. Since the organization’s establishment, it has
developed organizationally and functionally, such as in holding regular meetings between national leaderlevel officials, and establishing the organization’s head office along with the Regional Antiterrorist Structure
(RATS).
64) North Korea seems to emphasize negotiations with the United States over the nuclear issue, and it is

believed that China, apprehensive that the destabilization of situations in surrounding countries would lead
to repercussions within China, hesitates to employ firm measures. In light of this, there is a view that China’s
wieldable influence on North Korea is limited.
65) Major recent military exchanges between China and Southeast Asian countries include the first joint

search and rescue training conducted between the Chinese and Thai Navies in December 2005, the joint
counterterrorism military exercise conducted between the Chinese and Thai Armies in July 2007, the first
joint patrol conducted by Chinese and Vietnamese naval vessels in the Gulf of Tonkin in April 2006, and
visits by then Chinese Defense Minister Cao Gangchuan to the Philippines in September 2007 and to
Indonesia in January 2008.
66) China traditionally adopted the strategy of a “People’s War” based on the recognition that there was a

possibility of world-scale war in the future. Under that strategy, the country attributed importance to guerrilla
warfare using its vast territory and enormous population. This posture, however, led to harmful effects such
as excessively enlarged and inefficient military forces. Under these circumstances, China has come to place
importance on local wars that occur over its own lands and waters since the first half of the 1980s based on
a new recognition that a world-scale war will not take place on a long-term basis. After the end of the Gulf
War in 1991, the country started to implement measures to improve its military operation abilities in order
to win local wars under highly technological conditions. In recent years, China has established the strategic
objectives of establishing informationalized armed forces and winning the informatization war.
67) For example, in China’s National Defense in 2006, published in December 2006, “opposing and containing

the separatist forces for ‘Taiwan Independence’ as well as their activities” is included in the country’s
national defense policy.
68) According to China’s National Defense in 2006.
69) The Communist Party of China’s constitution amended in 2002 states, “Upon the 100th anniversary of

the party’s foundation in (2021), a higher-level, somewhat affluent society shall be created that benefits a
population of over a billion, and upon the 100th anniversary of the country’s foundation (2049), the nation
shall achieve a medium level of development for per-capita gross domestic product, realizing modernization
on a basic level.”
70) The white paper, China’s National Defense in 2006, states that, “In the past two years, senior PLA delegations

have visited more than 60 countries, and defense ministers, commander in chiefs of the services, and chiefs
of the general and other high-ranking officers and military-related officials from more than 90 countries


-----

have visited China.”
71) China’s announced national defense budget growth rate is a comparative rate figure of the previous year’s

actual expenditure with this year’s initial budget. When comparing last year’s initial budget with this
year’s initial budget, the growth rate totals approximately 18.0%. Simple conversion of national defense
expenditures into foreign currencies based on the market exchange rate does not always accurately reflect
the value in light of the country’s level of prices. If, however, China’s FY 2008 national defense budget is
converted into yen at 1 yuan = 15 yen, the amount is equivalent to approximately 6,149.1 billion yen.
72) U.S. Defense Department’s Annual Report on Military Power of the People’s Republic of China (March

2008) estimates that China’s actual military-related spending for 2007 could be $97 billion to $139 billion,
although its official defense budget for 2007 is approximately $45.99 billion. The report points out that,
“China’s published defense budget does not include large categories of expenditures, including expense
for strategic forces, (nuclear and missile), foreign acquisition of weapons, military-related research and
development, and China’s parliamentary forces.”
73) The People’s Armed Force is responsible for protecting facilities of the party and the state, border patrol,

maintaining security, implementing joint government-citizen projects, and conducting firefighting activities.
According to China’s National Defense in 2002, these troops are to maintain state security and social
stability, and assist the PLA in wartime in defensive operations.
74) The militia engages in economic construction in peacetime and logistics support for combat operations in

wartime. China’s National Defense in 2002 explains, “Under the command of military organs, the militia in
wartime helps the standing army in its military operations, conducts independent operations and provides
combat support and manpower replenishment for the standing army. In peacetime, it undertakes the tasks
of performing combat readiness support, taking part in emergency rescue and disaster relief efforts, and
maintaining social order.”
75) Formally, there are two Central Military Commissions—one for the CCP and one for the state itself.

However, both commissions basically consist of the same membership, and both are essentially regarded as
institutions for the CPC to command the military forces.
76) The Annual Threat Assessment of the Director of National Intelligence published in the United States in

January 2007 states as follows: “The Chinese are developing maneuverable reentry vehicles (MaRV) to
attack U.S. aircraft carriers and air stations.”
77) U.S. Defense Department’s Annual Report on Military Power of the People’s Republic of China (March

2008) states that as of November 2007 China had deployed 990 to 1,070 SRBMs on the shore opposing
Taiwan, and it is increasing the size of this force at a rate of more than 100 missiles per year, including
variants of these missiles with improved ranges, accuracies and payloads.
78) According to the China’s National Defense in 2006 white paper.
79) Since the 1980s, China has been purchasing retired aircraft carriers, the decommissioned Majestic-class

aircraft carrier Melbourne made in the United Kingdom and Kiev-class aircraft carriers Minsk and Kiev
made in the former Soviet Union, nominally for recycling scraps of iron and for using them as leisure
facilities. In 2000, China purchased an uncompleted Kuznetsov-class aircraft carrier Varyag from Ukraine
and reportedly has been repairing it, including repainting. In 2006, it was reported that China was negotiating
the purchase of Russian made Su-33 carrier-based fighter aircraft, which can be operated with a Kuznetsovclass carrier, and it was also reported in 2007 that China had plans to purchase arresting wires that are used
on aircraft carriers from Russia. There have been reports since 2005 of positive remarks by multiple Chinese
government officials and military personnel about possession and construction of aircraft carriers.
80) U.S. Department of Defense’s Annual Report on Military Power of the People’s Republic of China (May

2006) points out that the goal of the PLA Air Force is “to develop a mobile, all-weather, day-night, low

-----

altitude, and over-water force that is capable and flexible enough to quickly perform multiple operational
tasks and to project power beyond the “first island chain.”
81) The Chinese National Space Administration, which was traditionally in charge of the country’s space

development, was placed beneath the Commission of Science, Technology, and Industry for National
Defense, which oversees the defense industry. (It appears that these two bodies were integrated into the
newly established Ministry of Industry and Information Technology as a result of the organizational reform
in March 2008.) In addition, China’s National Defense in 2006 notates that, regarding the national defense
science and technology industry, “Major scientific and technological projects such as manned space flights
and the Lunar Probe Project, carried out to spur the leapfrogging development of high-tech enterprises and
to bring about overall improvement in defense-related science and technology.”
82) U.S. Department of Defense’s Annual Report on Military Power of the People’s Republic of China (March

2008) points out that “The PLA has established information warfare units to develop viruses to attack enemy
computer systems plus networks, and tactics and measures to protect friendly computer systems in addition
to networks. In 2005, the PLA began to incorporate offensive CNO into its exercises, primarily in first
strikes against enemy networks.”
83) On September 9, 2005, a P-3C patrol aircraft of the MSDF confirmed that five vessels in total, including

one Sovremenny-class destroyer, were sailing near the Kashi (Tianwaitian in Chinese) gas field in the East
China Sea, and some of the vessels (a total of three including the Sovremenny-class destroyer) circled
around the drilling facilities of the said gas field.
84) On June 18 of this year, the governments of both Japan and China agreed on the cooperation in the East

China Sea, including the joint development in the northern sea region, and the participation of Japanese
corporate in the development of Shirakaba (Chunxiao in Chinese) gas field.
85) A view has been presented that China has assumed an increasingly confident and assertive stance than

before (in the military field), and the anti-satellite weapon test in January 2007 and the Chinese Song-class
submarine incident in October 2006 where the submarine surfaced near the USS Kitty Hawk in international
waters can be viewed in this context. (According to the testimony of then Deputy Undersecretary of Defense
Richard Lawless at the U.S.-China Economic and Security Review Commission held in February 1, 2007.)
86) It is reported that China is constructing a large-scale naval base that has an underground tunnel for nuclear
powered submarines in the city of Sanya located in the southern tip of Hainan Province.
87) According to the National Defense Report published by the Ministry of National Defense of Taiwan of

2008.
88) According to the National Defense Report published by the Ministry of National Defense of Taiwan of

2008.
89) The ruling party United Russia attained 315 seats, or 70%, of Russia’s lower house (450 seats total).

92) The National Security Concept of the Russian Federation, formulated in 1997, was revised in January 2000.

This revision was made in response to changed circumstances including NATO enlargement, air strikes on
the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia, NATO’s announcement of its so-called “New Strategic Concept,” and
the emergence of Islamic extremist groups in Russia and other countries. Currently, the Concept appears to
be under revision, and discussion about the issue of making Concept revisions was held in January 2008 at
a congress on national security jointly hosted by the Russian Military Academy and the Russian Ministry
of Defense. The discussion compared awareness of the situation from 2000 until present, emphasized
opposition to the U.S. and Europe rather than excessive focus on terrorist countermeasures for Russia and


-----

other countries, and indicated efforts for sustaining and improving strategic nuclear forces in order to pursue
military modernization and ensure deterrence.
93) A change can be seen in Russian stance on the NATO enlargement since the National Security Concept

was first developed. In recent years, Russia has repeatedly expressed its concern over NATO’s expansion,
while the country has also stated its intent to focus on promoting cooperation with NATO. In April 2005, a
status of forces agreement was signed between Russia and NATO allowing for such measures as permitting
the militaries of both parties to pass through each other’s territory in consideration of the deployment of
International Security Assistance Forces (ISAF) in Afghanistan.
94) Additionally, other threats to Russia include trials to weaken Russia as a central player in a multipolar world,

movements to weaken the CIS integration process, and territory demands of Russia.
95) Other peacetime operations included preventing and hindering destructive activities, maintaining of a

position of readiness for strategic deterrence capabilities and the use of those capabilities, peace-building
operations commissioned by the U.N. or CIS, and emergency prevention and repairing damages in the event
of an emergency.
96) Troops were reorganized in the reduction of military forces after the launch of the Russian Federation’s

armed forces, and military personnel were concentrated together into a unit with a higher capability for
taking immediate action. As combat-ready troops, this unit is anticipated to promptly respond in the first
phase of a large-scale war or in the event of a small conflict.
97) In May 2006, then President Putin commented that Russia would aim to reduce the number to an appropriate

level of one million through non-forced retirement.
98) Equipment upgrades based on Russia’s state policy on military equipment include acquiring new types of

ICBMs and SSBNs as well as strategic bombers in regards to nuclear forces, and acquiring and modernizing
new types of aircrafts (Su-34) regarding conventional forces.
99) In April 2007, then President Putin stated that professional servicemen would account for two-thirds of the

armed forces in his annual addresses. In addition, the period for conscription was reduced to 12 months as
of January 2008.
100) Then President Putin’s speech “Russia’s Development Strategy through 2020” (February 2008).
101) Some CIS countries want to maintain their distance from Russia. Georgia, Ukraine, Azerbaijan, and

Moldova formed a regional alliance named GUAM by combining the initial letters of the member countries,
and have been following pro-Western policies to reduce their security and economic dependence on Russia.
(Uzbekistan joined GUAM in 1999 after withdrawing from the CIS Collective Security Treaty, but withdrew
from the alliance in 2005.)
102) In August 2001, Russia, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyz, and Tajikistan provided one troop unit each (battalion or

smaller unit) to form the Collective Rapid Deployment Force that consisted of 1,000 to 1,300 members. The
headquarters is located in Bishkek, the capital of Kyrgyz. In May 2004, Tajikistan provided another two
troop units, and Russia and Kazakhstan provided one unit each as well. As a result, the effort has expanded
into nine battalions with 4,500 personnel.
103) In November 2005, U.S. forces withdrew from Uzbekistan.
104) The United States and other parties have been using the Manas base, which is located close to Kant Air

Base, for anti-terrorism operations.
105) CIS Peace-keeping Units (mainly by Russian forces) have been deployed to Abkhazia in Georgia and Joint

Peace-keeping Units (formationally Russian, Georgian and South Ossetian forces) have been deployed to
South Ossetia in Georgia.
106) Military cooperation between the two countries, which started with confidence building, is now developing

into a state that envisages actual joint efforts. For example, command post exercises codenamed “Torgau


-----

2004” were started between the U.S. ground forces stationed in Europe and Russian ground forces in 2004,
“Torgau 2005” was conducted in 2005, and “Torgau 2007,” which included field training, was also held in
2007.
107) The United States, in its Quadrennial Defense Review (QDR) published in February 2006, states “The

United States remains concerned about the erosion of democracy in Russia, the restrictions put on nongovernmental organizations (NGOs) and freedom of the press, the centralization of political powers and
limits on economic freedom.”
108) The following nine items have been named as common interests: 1) the fight against terrorism, 2) crisis

management, 3) the non-proliferation of weapons of mass destruction and their conveyance, 4) measures
to increase arms control and confidence, 5) theater missile defense, 6) search and rescue at sea, 7) military
cooperation and defense reform, 8) responses to civilian emergency situations, and 9) new threats and
challenges.

was met on changing the possession limit by bloc and by country and territory, ensuring transparency and
predictability, trust building and verification measures, and compliance with the current CFE Treaty until
the CFE Application Treaty took effect. As of present, only Russia, Belarus, Kazakhstan, and Ukraine have
ratified the CFE Application treaty, and it has yet to take effect.

been founded November 2007.
115) From 2003 to 2004, Russia concluded contracts with Indonesia, Malaysia, and Viet Nam to sell its Su-27

and Su-30 jet fighters. In addition, some fighters have already been delivered to the contracting countries,
and in January 2004, Russia signed a contract to sell an aircraft carrier to India. In 2006, the country
concluded agreements to sell Su-30 jet fighters with Algeria and Venezuela, and some have already been
delivered to the countries.

$20 billion over the ensuing 10 years to assist Russia in the disposing of chemical weapons, dismantling of
decommissioned nuclear submarines, and disposing of fissionable materials. The purpose of this decision
was to prevent the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction.
117) Considering the fact that countries other than the United States and Russia possess IRBMs, Russia had

indicated its withdrawal from the INF Treaty that solely regulated the U.S. and Russia. However, in October
2007, Russia and the U.S. stated to the international community that the INF Treaty would be going
global.

military cooperation with the United States.
125) IMET, started in 1976, provides military personnel from U.S. allies and friends with opportunities to study

and receive training at U.S. military education institutions. The United States suspended IMET for Indonesia

2004, which was renewed at the Helsinki Headline Goal in 1999.
189) In March 2004, four Central and Eastern European countries and three Baltic countries joined NATO,

including Romania, Slovenia, Estonia, Lithuania, Latvia, Bulgaria and Slovakia. The accession of Albania
and Croatia was approved at the NATO Summit Meeting held in April 2008.
190) A separate cooperation agreement has been concluded between NATO and the countries of the Organization

for Security and Co-operation in Europe (OSCE), which was established in 1994 consisting of non-NATO
member countries such as those of Central and Eastern Europe.
191) Established in 1994, MD currently has seven participating countries (Algeria, Egypt, Israel, Jordan,

Mauritania, Morocco and Tunisia). Its objective is to foster stability in the Mediterranean region through
political dialogue and engagement in NATO-related activities by the countries of the Mediterranean
region.
192) The name “contact country” has been used since the NATO Istanbul Summit Meeting in 2004. Contact

countries pursue partnerships on a case-by-case basis with countries which share common interests and
concerns.
193) On the other hand, NATO’s approach toward Russia merits attention regarding points on which the two

sides disagree, such as the expansion of NATO and the CFE Treaty. EU-Russia relations have been strained
over the dispatch of the European Union Rule of Law Mission in Kosovo (EULEX Kosovo). Kosovo
declared independence on February 17 of this year.
194) With regard to the details of the Ministerial Meeting of the Defense Planning Committee held in June 2006,

NATO’s press secretary stated that member countries have endeavored to meet a target of 2% of GDP for
defense spending in accordance with the Comprehensive Political Guidance.
195) The white paper Delivering Security in a Changing World published in December 2003, due to the need

for rapid and long-range deployment of military force in order to deal with international terrorism and the
proliferation of WMD, set the objective of establishing defense capabilities to support three concurrent
operations, including one enduring peace support operation.
196) The Strategic Defence Review (SDR) in 1998 stated that a direct military threat to the U.K. did not exist and

that recurrence of such a threat could not be predicted.
197) Delivering Security in a Changing World in December 2003 stated that there was no longer a need for

capacity to prepare for recurrence of direct, traditional, strategic threats to the U.K. or its allies.
198) The currently operating Vanguard class nuclear-powered submarines are expected to begin decommissioning

in the early 2020s. Therefore, the U.K. government considered whether or not to maintain its nuclear
deterrent and consequently announced this white paper. In March 2007, the House of Commons adopted the
motion submitted by the government to support the policy set forth in the white paper.
199) The intervention force comprises combat readiness troops equipped with state-of-the-art weapons. It is

designed to deal with opponents that have well-organized military formations in intensive operations, which
are implemented multilaterally by NATO combat readiness troops or EU Battle group units, with the goal of
providing the foundation for peace stabilization operations. The stabilization force deals with opponents that


-----

have a certain level of military formations and performs peace stabilization operations in low- and mediumintensity operations that last for a relatively long period. The assistance force supports the intervention and
stabilization forces in preparing for and performing operations in Germany and in the target areas, including
the management of command, educational and training organizations.
200) At the presentation of Ship Submersible Ballistic Nuclear, Le Terrible, in March 2008, French president

Sarkozy expressed the view concerning the country’s nuclear capability: given the existing risk of nuclear
proliferation and other threats, nuclear deterrence is the ultimate guarantee; nuclear deterrence protects
France from any aggression against vital national interests emanating from a state and it is essential to
maintain its missile capabilities, both submarine-launched and air-launched. He also announced his decision
to reduce France’s air-launched nuclear missile capability by one-third, which means its arsenal becomes no
more than 300 warheads.
201) France currently does not participate in the NATO Defense Planning Committee or the Nuclear Planning

Group. In addition, though France indicated in the Defense White Paper that it will aim for full participation
in NATO, it also stated that it will maintain the following principles: (1) complete independence of its
nuclear forces, (2) the autonomy of the French government in the assessment of military situations, and (3)
freedom in decision-making regarding military involvement.
202) NATO and Warsaw Pact Organization (WPO) member countries as of 1990.
203) Efforts are made to disclose military intelligence, restrict certain military operations, and promote military

communication in order to prevent accidental armed conflicts and foster confidence among nations. These
are generally called Confidence Building Measures.
204) Subsequently, the Vienna Document 1999 was adopted in 1999, which added the promotion of multilateral

and bilateral measures for regional confidence building, the provision of information concerning military
exchange, and restrictions on exercises of a scale employing armored infantry tanks and artillery.
205) Inspection flights are performed in accordance with flight plans established by the inspecting country and

approved by the inspected country using unarmed aircraft equipped with sensors of a pre-determined type.
Data collected by inspection flights can be obtained by all signatory countries.
206) These include a proposal submitted in October 2007 calling for a strengthening of the U.N. Department of
Political Affairs which is in charge of conflict prevention and such. (See Item 3 of this section) In addition,
the Peacebuilding Commission, established at the end of 2005, began full-scale operations in 2006, and
as of the end of last year it had identified Burundi, Sierra Leone and Guinea-Bissau on the agendas of the
Commission.
207) For example, some missions established in recent years are authorized to take all necessary measures to

protect civilians, to guard U.N. facilities, and to maintain security.
208) A knowledge base is being developed; for example, U.N. Peacekeeping Operations: Principles and

Guidelines (the PKOs Capstone Doctrine) concerning the wealth of lessons learned over 60-year history of
PKOs and the character and mission of PKOs today was published in March 2008.
209) The past several years have seen a particularly prominent trend toward larger missions. Of the seven large
scale missions comprising more than 8,000 personnel underway at the end of May of this year, five have
been established within the past five years, and the remaining two missions were expanded to a scale of
more than 8,000 personnel within last five years.
210) Africa is the main area of PKO missions. Of a total of around 88,000 personnel dispatched, approximately

61,000 are in Africa, accounting for 70%.
211) The total number of fatalities among U.N. personnel engaged in PKOs and other operations is so far 2,474

(as of the end of May 2008), with 90 reported last year (of which 43 died of illness). Of the 554 fatalities in
the past five years, 275 were attributable to illness, substantially exceeding accident (151) and hostile act
(90).

Section 1. Measures to Ensure Japan’s Security

The peace, security and independence that are indispensable for a country do not happen of their own accord. As
countries become increasingly interdependent on one another, attaining peace, security and independence requires
a comprehensive approach that includes diplomatic measures, cooperation with allies, as well as the nation’s own
defense system. As Japan is heavily dependent on other countries for many resources and its development and
prosperity depends on free trade, sustained peace and cooperation with the international community is of vital
importance.

For this reason, Japan is pursuing both regional cooperation in the Asia-Pacific region and global cooperation

through organizations such as the United Nations (U.N.), while strengthening bilateral cooperation with other
countries through such measures as the Japan-U.S. Alliance[1]. Japan is thus working to prevent and resolve
disputes and hostilities, encourage economic development, promote arms control and disarmament, and increase
mutual understanding and trust.

Japan has also been making the country itself more secure by making society more stable, fostering a

willingness to defend the country, and through various economic and educational measures. The objective is to
avoid being unguarded, which could lead to foreign aggression.

In today’s world, however, such measures may not deter real aggression by an outside force, and in the worst

case, might not be sufficient to repel an attack on Japan. It is indeed difficult to guarantee national security purely
by non-military means.

Defense capability is in itself an expression of a nation’s will and ability to repel aggression. It provides the

ultimate guarantee of a country’s security, and cannot easily be replaced by other means. Therefore, preparation
for full-scale aggression is essential, which is the basic role of defense capability. Moreover, the current security
environment requires a defense capability that can effectively respond to new threats and various circumstances
such as international terrorism and the proliferation
and transfer of weapons of mass destruction and
ballistic missiles. Therefore, the Government has been
strengthening its defense capabilities and upholds the
Japan-U.S. Security Arrangements, thereby improving
the credibility of such arrangements and bolstering
its defense measures. In addition to protecting Japan,
defense capabilities have become increasingly important
for peacekeeping activities, reconstruction assistance,
and other efforts to improve international security.

Recognizing the important role played by its

defense capabilities, Japan continues to do its utmost

security in the Asia-Pacific region and beyond.

Section 2. The Constitution and the Right of Self-Defense

**1. The Constitution and the Right of Self-Defense**
Since the end of World War II, Japan has worked hard to build a peace-loving nation far from the miseries of war.
The Japanese people desire lasting peace, and the principle of pacifism is enshrined in the Constitution, of which
Article 9 renounces war, the possession of war potential, and the right of belligerence by the state. Nonetheless,
since Japan is an independent nation, these provisions do not deny Japan’s inherent right of self-defense as a
sovereign state.

Since the right of self-defense is not denied, the Government interprets this to mean that the Constitution allows

Japan to possess the minimum level of armed force needed to exercise that right. Therefore, the Government, as
part of its exclusively national defense-oriented policy under the Constitution, maintains the Self-Defense Forces
(SDF) as an armed organization, and continues to keep it equipped and ready for operations.

**2. The Government’s View on Article 9 of the Constitution**

**1. The Permitted Self-Defense Capability**
Under the Constitution, Japan is permitted to possess the minimum necessary level of self-defense capability.

The specific limit may vary with the prevailing international situation, the technologies available, and various

other factors, and it is discussed and decided according to annual budgets and other factors by the Diet on behalf
of the people. Whether such capability constitutes a “war potential” that is prohibited by Article 9, Paragraph 2
of the Constitution must be considered within the context of Japan’s overall military strength. Therefore, whether
the SDF should be allowed to possess certain armaments depends on whether such possession would cause its
total military strength to exceed the constitutional limit.

The possession of armaments deemed to be offensive weapons designed to be used only for the mass

destruction of another country would, by definition, exceed the minimum necessary level and as such, is not
permissible under any circumstances. For example, the SDF is not allowed to possess intercontinental ballistic
missiles (ICBMs), long-range strategic bombers, or attack aircraft carriers.

**2. Requirements for Exercising the Right of Self-Defense**
The Government has long interpreted Article 9 of the Constitution to mean that armed force can be used to
exercise the right of self-defense only when the following three conditions are met:
1) When there is an imminent and illegitimate act of aggression against Japan;
2) When there is no appropriate means to deal with such aggression other than by resorting to the right; and
3) When the use of armed force is confined to the minimum necessary level.

**3. Geographic Boundaries within which the Right of Self-Defense may be Exercised**
The use of minimum necessary force to defend Japan under the right of self-defense is not necessarily confined
to the geographic boundaries of Japanese territory, territorial waters and airspace. However, it is difficult to give
a general definition of the actual extent to which it may be used, as this would vary with the situation.

Nevertheless, the Government interprets that the Constitution does not permit armed troops to be dispatched

to the land, sea, or airspace of other countries with the aim of using force; such overseas deployment of troops
would exceed the definition of the minimum necessary level for self-defense.


-----

**4. The Right of Collective Self-Defense**
International law permits a state to have the right of collective self-defense, which is the right to use force to
stop an armed attack on a foreign country with which the state has close relations, even if the state itself is not
under direct attack. Since Japan is a sovereign state, it naturally has the right of collective self-defense under
international law. Nevertheless, the Japanese Government believes that the exercise of the right of collective selfdefense exceeds the limit on self-defense authorized under Article 9 of the Constitution and is not permissible.

**5. The Right of Belligerence**
Article 9, Paragraph 2 of the Constitution prescribes that the “the right of belligerence of the State shall not be
recognized.” However, the “right of belligerence” does not mean the right to engage in battle; rather it is a general
term for various rights that a belligerent nation has under international law, including the authority to inflict
casualties and damage upon the enemy’s military force and to occupy enemy territory.

On the other hand, Japan may of course use the minimum level of force necessary to defend itself. For

example, if Japan inflicts casualties and damage upon the enemy’s military force in exercising its right of selfdefense, this is conceptually distinguished from the exercise of the right of belligerence, even though the actual
actions appear to be no different. Occupation of enemy territory, however, would exceed the minimum necessary
level of self-defense and so is not permissible. (See Column)

**COMMENTARY**

**Discussions Involving the Constitution**

The Law concerning the Procedure to Revise the Constitution of Japan (the national referendum law)
was enacted in May 2007 to be substantially enforced in 2010. This law provides the basis of a national
referendum for the approval of the Japanese people concerning the revision of the Constitution. In addition,
as a partial enforcement of the law, a research commission on the Constitution was installed in both houses
in August last year.

Recent years have seen discussions on the Constitution in the Diet and other venues. The

commissions on the Constitution of both houses submitted reports in April 2005. The reports referred
to security issues, such as Article 9 of the Constitution, the right of self-defense and the Self-Defense
Forces, as well as international cooperation. The reports introduce the various opinions that were
discussed in these commissions.

Subsequently, the Democratic Party of Japan announced its proposals on the Constitution in October

2005, while the Liberal Democratic Party presented its draft for a new Constitution in the following
month. The New Komeito Party advocates that the Constitution should be reinforced by additional
concepts. Article 9 of the Constitution is one of the issues raised by parties. These parties clarified
their policy to uphold pacifist principles, and the Liberal Democratic Party drafted articles of the
“self-defense military forces” and its activities. In addition, the Democratic Party of Japan and the New
Komeito Party have also shown their perspective and points about the existence of the Self-Defense
Forces and the positioning of its international activities.


-----

Section 3. The Basis of Defense Policy

**1. National Defense Policy**
Under the Constitution, Japan has adhered to its National Defense Policy, which was adopted by the National
Defense Council[2] and approved by the Cabinet in 1957. (See Reference 6)

The National Defense Policy defines policies to establish the foundation of security through international

harmonization and peace activities, as well as ensuring the stability of society, and then to establish efficient
defense capabilities and to maintain the Japan-U.S. Security Arrangements.

**2. Other Basic Policies**
Under the National Defense Policy, Japan has been building a modest defense capability under the Constitution
purely for defense purposes without becoming a military power that could threaten other countries, while
adhering to the principle of civilian control of the military, observing the Three Non-Nuclear Principles, and
firmly maintaining the Japan-U.S. Security Arrangements.

**1. Exclusively Defense-Oriented Policy**
The exclusively defense-oriented policy means that Japan will not employ defensive force unless and until an
armed attack is mounted on Japan by another country, and even in such a case, only the minimum force necessary
to defend itself may be used. Furthermore, only the minimum defense forces necessary for self-defense should be
retained and used. This exclusively defense-oriented policy is a passive defense strategy that is consistent with
the spirit of the Constitution.

**2. Not Becoming a Military Power**
There is no established definition for the term “military power.” For Japan, however, not becoming a military
power that could threaten the security of other countries means that Japan will not possess more military force
than is necessary for self-defense and that could pose a threat to other countries.

**3. The Three Non-Nuclear Principles**
The Three Non-Nuclear Principles are that Japan: will not possess nuclear weapons, will not produce nuclear
weapons, and will not allow nuclear weapons into Japan. Japan adheres to the Three Non-Nuclear Principles as
a fixed national policy.

Japan is prohibited from manufacturing or possessing nuclear weapons also under the Atomic Energy Basic

Law[3]. In addition, Japan ratified the NPT (Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons), and as a nonnuclear weapons state, is not permitted to produce or acquire nuclear weapons[4].

**4. Ensuring Civilian Control**
Civilian control of the military means the precedence of political will over the military in a democratic state, and
hence democratic political control over the military.

Learning lessons from World War II, Japan has adopted the following systems of uncompromising civilian

control that are entirely different from those under the former Constitution[5]. Civilian control ensures that the SDF
is operated in accordance with the will of the people.

The Japanese people are represented in the Diet, which makes legislative and budgetary decisions on matters

such as the authorized number of SDF Regular Personnel and principal institutions of the SDF. It also approves
defense operations. As part of its general administrative functions, the Cabinet has entire authority related to
defense. The Constitution requires the Prime Minister and other Ministers of State in the Cabinet to be civilians.


-----

The Prime Minister, acting on behalf of the Cabinet, is the supreme commander of the SDF. The Minister of
Defense, who is exclusively in charge of national defense, exercises general control over SDF activities. The
Security Council of Japan[6] within the Cabinet discusses
important defense matters.

At the Ministry of Defense, the Minister of

Defense is in charge of administrative work related to
national defense and controls the SDF. The Minister of
Defense is assisted in planning political measures and
administration by the Senior Vice-Minister and two
Parliamentary Secretaries[7].

As mentioned above, the military is under civilian

control. The success of the system depends on ongoing
political and administrative efforts, as well as a keen
interest among Japanese citizens in defense issues.

**COMMENTARY**

**Civilian Control**

While the military is a necessary means to protect the peace and independence of a nation, the military
meant to protect the people of a country can, to the contrary, expose them to danger if used wrongly, as
the ancient Greek philosopher Plato said. Civilian control was developed as a measure to prevent military
intervention in government utilizing the military under political control, and ensures the primacy of the
democratic government over the military.

The system of civilian control first emerged in England, in the formulation process of constitutionalism

in which a parliament limited the powers of the absolute monarch. In other words, the limitations of the
monarch were clearly stated to protect civilian rights in the Magna Carta (Great Charter) established in
1215, and at an assembly in 1628, the Petition of Right, demanding right and liberty by legislation, was
conducted. Also, established in 1689 after the Glorious Revolution, the Bill of Rights that formed the
basis for British constitutional government made it illegal for a monarch to conscript and maintain a
standing army in the country during peacetime without the consent of Parliament. The system remains
in place to this day.

Furthermore, the Constitution of the United States of America established in 1787 and the post
French Revolution French Constitution of 1791 also provide for various systems of civilian control.
Today, in democratic countries in Europe and the United States, the United Kingdom, Germany, and
France, not only does the Parliament make decisions on important military matters such as laws and
budgets, but the president, prime minister, or other executive civilian leader exercises control over the
military. In this way, policies to ensure civilian control have been established in each country.

Such systems of those countries are by no means identical. For example, Germany is particularly

careful to exercise military control by the Parliament, while in France, the executive branch of
government has stronger control over the military than the Parliament.

Moreover, the national defense organizations that assist the president or prime minister in

implementing civilian control vary widely from country to country. In the United States, the central
organization (the Office of the Department of Defense) is organized mainly by politically-appointed
civilian executives (in this case, the Secretary of Defense), but in the United Kingdom’s central
organization, the civilian and military executives are positioned in parallel.

Japan has also adopted various systems for strict civilian control, and leaving repentance preceding

the end of the war, has put effort in achieving thoroughness in civilian control through maintaining and
operating the SDF, a power organization, under democracy.

Today, the SDF has become an organization that is expected to be active in many contexts both

within Japan and overseas, including international peace cooperation activities, with the aim of further
ensuring Japan’s safety and security. These efforts are made in response to the changing times, including
the end of the Cold War, the response to global terrorism, and Japan’s elevated international status.

From the perspective of how to best utilize the SDF to ensure the nation’s interests and fulfill

Japan’s international responsibility, Japan is currently tasked to further improve and strengthen the
various systems of civilian control in order to reconstruct the modality of the Ministry of Defense and
the SDF.

Section 4. Transition to a Ministry and Stipulation of International Peace

Cooperation Activities as SDF’s Primary Mission[8]

The Defense Agency became the Ministry of Defense (MOD) on January 9, 2007. At the same time, international
peace cooperation activities were positioned as the primary mission of the Self-Defense Forces (SDF). The
MOD/SDF is an organization that bears the role of securing the peace and independence of Japan, the most
fundamental role to the nation’s existence. The two major steps of making the transition to the MOD and
stipulation of international peace cooperation activities as the primary mission of the SDF were carried out in
order to respond more precisely to today’s important challenge of coping with the issues of security and crisis
management.

This section discusses the steps and the debate concerning the “general law” for international peace

cooperation, which has become an issue of current interest.

**1. Significance of Transition to a Ministry**

**1. Significance of Transition to a Ministry**

**(1) Bolstering the Defense Policy-making/Planning System**
The mission of the SDF has been expanding and diversifying in recent years. The actual number of operations of
the SDF has increased. Important defense-related bills have been passed by the Diet almost every year.

The transition to a ministry created a minister with exclusive responsibility for national defense. The Minister

of Defense has been granted responsibility and authority appropriate to a policy organ that enables the MOD
to present a variety of policy options. This bolstered its policy-making/planning functions and implementation
capabilities.

**(2) Rapid and Appropriate Response to Diverse Emergency Situations**
The transition to a ministry has reinforced Japan’s system for responding to emergency situations in the following
respects.
**a. By giving the Minister of Defense exclusive responsibility for national defense, the line of responsibility for**

Japan’s defense has been clarified

**b. Japan’s efforts in undertaking national crisis management will be demonstrated clearly at home and abroad**
**c. Posture of crisis management will be further enhanced and strengthened as the Minister of Defense will directly**

perform the following tasks as the minister in charge:
1) Requests to the Prime Minister to call Cabinet meetings[9] for enactment and amendment of laws concerning

security or the SDF and enactment of ministerial ordinances;
2) Requests to the Finance Minister for budget requests and implementation; acquisition of government properties

such as training areas;
3) Requests to the Prime Minister to call Cabinet meetings to make decisions on implementation of important

activities to protect the lives and property of the public, such as maritime security operations;
4) Requests to the Prime Minister to call Cabinet meetings for approving personnel appointments to major

positions at the Ministry of Defense/SDF.

The authority of the Prime Minister as the head of the Cabinet shall continue to be possessed by the Prime

Minister.


-----

**(3) Development of a Structure to Engage in Proactive Efforts toward the Peace and Stability**

**of the International Community**

MOD has become a ministry equivalent to administrative organs in charge of national defense in other countries
for defense talks, international dialogue and in cooperation with other countries in SDF activities conducted
overseas. Moreover, engaging in discussions with defense heads of other countries as an equal governmental
chief both in name and reality will further deepen confidence-building and cooperative relations.

**2. Adherence to the Basics of Defense Policies**
The purpose of the transition to the MOD is to prepare a structure suitable for an organization taking on the
important function of defense policy-making/planning; it does not involve a change in the fundamental aspects
of Japan’s defense policy nor in the relationship between the Constitution of Japan and the right of self-defense.
(See Chapter 1, Section 3 for a description of these principles)

**2. Significance of Stipulation of International Peace Cooperation Activities as SDF’s**

**Primary Mission**

**1. Concepts Prior to the Stipulation as Primary Mission**
The first priority mission of the SDF is defense operation against direct and indirect aggression. Missions by
the SDF on an as-needed basis are called second priority missions[10]. The primary missions of the SDF are thus
comprised of the first priority mission and second priority missions.

The international peace cooperation activities of the SDF, consisting of operations based on the Law

Concerning Measures to Ensure the Peace and Security of Japan in Situations in Areas Surrounding Japan, as
well as minesweeping and evacuating Japanese nationals overseas, were positioned as supplementary activities
provided for in Chapter 8 (miscellaneous provisions) or the supplementary provisions of the SDF Law.

**2. Review on Positioning of Missions**
In recent years, however, these roles—international peace cooperation activities, response to situations in areas
surrounding Japan, minesweeping to ensure the safe navigation of ships, and evacuation of Japanese nationals
overseas at a time of conflict—have increasingly become the focus of defense capability. A structure is needed so
that the MOD can appropriately fulfill these roles. As part of the abovementioned development of such a structure,
these operations have been upgraded from the traditional position of supplementary missions to primary missions
of the SDF.

For the SDF to proactively undertake international peace cooperation activities, progress will be needed

in setting up education/training and other systems, in the area of improving the readiness of necessary units,
and enhancing transport capabilities. In order for this to happen, it would be appropriate to review the place of
international peace cooperation activities among the SDF’s missions and stipulate them as primary missions.

Making Japan’s efforts for international peace cooperation activities as a primary mission will send a message

not only to the Japanese public but also to the international community. This will also enable SDF members
active in a challenging environment to focus on their duties with greater self-awareness and pride.

Stipulation of international peace cooperation activities as a primary mission does not assign new missions

to the SDF nor does it alter the nature (e.g., scope and authority) of SDF activities, which will remain unchanged.
These activities will continue to be implemented within a constitutional framework in accordance with the
provisions of the laws on which these activities are based.


-----

**3. Operations Newly Stipulated as Primary Missions**
Among those operations historically positioned as supplementary missions, the following were stipulated as
second priority primary missions.
(1) Activities that contribute to maintaining the peace and security of the international community including

operations based on the Anti-Terrorism Special Measures Law, and operations based on the Law Concerning
Special Measures on Humanitarian and Reconstruction Assistance in Iraq[11].
(2) Activities conducive to ensuring the peace and security of Japan in situations arising in areas surrounding

Japan, such as rear-area support and other activities based on the Law Concerning Measures to Ensure the
Peace and Security of Japan in Situations in Areas Surrounding Japan and ship inspection operations based
on the Ship Inspection Operations Law.
(3) Activities to ensure the safety of the lives and property of the Japanese people, such as minesweeping and the

evacuation of Japanese nationals overseas.

**3. Debate Concerning the General Law**
Recent years have seen a widening debate concerning the establishment of a general law for international peace
cooperation activities.

A report announced in December 2002 by the Advisory Group on International Peace Cooperation established

under then Chief Cabinet Secretary Fukuda proposed the start of study of the establishment of a general law for
cooperation by Japan in multinational forces based on U.N. resolutions (e.g. rear-area support such as medical
treatment, communications, and transport). In addition, a report announced in October 2004 by the Council on
Security and Defense Capabilities established by then Prime Minister Koizumi referred to the establishment of a
general law for international peace cooperation activities as a policy issue for achieving a new security strategy.

Meanwhile, on August 2006, the Defense Policy Sub-Committee of the Liberal Democratic Party (LDP)

approved the original draft of the International Peace Cooperation Bill as a suggestion for the party discussion to
be held afterwards, whose purpose was for Japan to engage proactively and on its own initiative in international


-----

peace cooperation activities. In addition, the first meeting was held by the project team of the ruling party in
May of this year, and as a result of nine sessions of vigorous discussion, a mid-term report[12] was completed in
the following month. Frequent discussions have also been held in the Diet on the significance and content of a
general law concerning these activities.

Japan has so far engaged in various types of international peace cooperation activities based on the International

Peace Cooperation Law and other frameworks. With the diversification of international cooperation activities
for maintaining international peace and security, special measures laws have been enacted on an individual
basis as the need arises. However, from the perspective of advancing prompt and effective international peace
cooperation, it would be desirable to establish a general law that provides in advance for matters including the
nature, condition and procedure of activities to be conducted by Japan, who is to appropriately play the role of
“the peace-fostering nation.” Such a law would also be significant for clarifying Japan’s fundamental policy
concerning such activities to the outside world.

The Ministry of Defense believes that a general law is an issue that will be studied based thoroughly on the

intensification of a national debate, including debate within the ruling parties.

Section 1. Basic Concepts of Formulating the National Defense Program Guidelines

The National Defense Program Guidelines set forth the basic principles of Japan’s security policy and the basic
guidelines for Japan’s defense capability in the future, including its significance and role as well as the specific
organization of the SDF and the target levels of major defense equipment to be built-up based on these principles
and guidelines.

The National Defense Program Guidelines have been formulated twice in the past, once in FY 1976 as “The

National Defense Program Guidelines for FY 1977[1] and Beyond” (NDPG 1976) and again in 1995 as “The
National Defense Program Guidelines for FY 1996[2] and Beyond” (NDPG 1995). After deliberation by bodies
such as the Defense Posture Review Board and the Security Council of the then Defense Agency[3], the current
guidelines were formulated in 2004 as “The National Defense Program Guidelines for FY 2005 and Beyond”
(NDPG 2004) in order to respond adequately to the international security environment following the 9/11 terrorist
attacks on the United States. This section explains the background and basic concepts of the formulation of the
National Defense Program Guidelines. (See Reference 8)

**1. Background to Formulating the NDPG**

**1. Changes in the International Situation and the Diversifying Roles of Military Capability**
Since the end of the Cold War, the interdependence of states has deepened and expanded, and with the advancement
of international coordination and cooperation, the likelihood of a global armed conflict has become even more
distant than it was at the time of the formulation of the NDPG in 1995. However, complex and diversified regional
conflicts stemming from territorial, religious, and ethnic issues have occurred, and responding to new threats and
diverse contingencies[4] has become an urgent task for various nations and the international community.

Against this background, maintaining conventional forms of deterrence remains important in order to prevent

inter-state conflicts. However, maintaining conventional forms of deterrence is not always effective against nonstate actors such as international terrorist organizations.

In addition, it has become increasingly difficult for a single country to resolve security environment issues,

and stabilizing the international security environment has become a common interest of all countries. Therefore,
each country has been making a broad range of efforts to resolve such issues through various means including
military capabilities, through coordination of various measures, and through international collaboration. In this
context, the roles of military capabilities have diversified to include prevention of conflict and reconstruction
assistance in addition to the traditional roles of deterrence and response to armed conflict.

Under these circumstances, the United States, while giving consideration to international collaboration, has

been engaged in a variety of activities, including the war on terror and activities to halt the proliferation of
weapons of mass destruction. Depending on the nature of these activities, there have been instances in which
international cooperative frameworks in the form of “coalitions” have been established that differ from traditional
alliance relations. (See Fig. II-2-1-1)

In the midst of these global changes, the countries in areas surrounding Japan are characterized by ethnic,

religious, political and economic diversity. The area also features several major countries with a complex structure
of interrelated interests and disputes over unification, territorial issues, and maritime interests. Many countries
are also modernizing and improving their military capabilities. In particular, North Korea is engaged in the
development and deployment of weapons of mass destruction and ballistic missiles as well as maintenance and
reinforcement of its asymmetric military capabilities (including large-scale special forces). In addition, China
continues to grow steadily as a major power in the region both politically and economically. In the military sphere,
the country has been modernizing its nuclear/missile forces as well as its naval/air capabilities, and seeking to

monitored in the future.

**2. Remarkable Developments of Scientific Technology**
Technological advancement, led by information and communications technology, have not only given rise to
significant improvement in combat capabilities, but have also brought about a fundamental transformation of
military power, exercising considerable influence on the defense strategies of all countries.

**3. Expansion of SDF Activities and the Improvement of Japan’s Emergency Response Mechanism**
The SDF’s activities have been diversifying and expanding to include response to incidents with suspicious
vessels, nuclear accidents, various natural disasters, illegal acts, emergency situations, and international
activities including both U.N. peacekeeping operations and cooperation in international efforts for preventing
and eradicating international terrorism, as well as efforts for the national reconstruction of Iraq. Through the
activities being undertaken in response to these situations, coordination with relevant agencies such as police and
local communities has been reinforced.

**4. Characteristics of Japan**
Closely located to major powers of the Eurasian continent, Japan is situated at a strategically important position
for the maritime traffic from the northeastern part of the continent to the Pacific Ocean. Japan’s territory consists
of a long and thin crescent-shaped archipelago with long coast lines and numerous small islands. The country’s
large population is confined within a very narrow territory, with industry and population concentrated mainly in
urban areas, while a large number of facilities essential to economic development are located in coastal areas,
all of which can be regarded in terms of topology as vulnerabilities. Due to geographic, geologic, and climate
conditions, Japan is also prone to natural disasters of various kinds.


-----

Furthermore, stability in the international security environment is essential for Japan’s stability and

development, which are based on a market-based economic system and free trade. Above all, Japan depends on
imports for many resources, relying on the Middle East for approximately 90% of its crude oil consumption. The
maintenance of secure and stable sea lanes are therefore of extreme importance to Japan.

**2. The Basic Concept of the National Defense Program Guidelines**

**1. Two Objectives and Three Approaches**
The purpose of Japan’s security is to protect the peace, independence, and territory of Japan; to maintain the national
system based on freedom and democracy; and to protect the lives and property of the people of the nation.

With a steady trend toward attaching importance to collaboration and cooperation in the international

community, as well as from the Japanese perspective of playing a role commensurate with the nation’s position
and gaining the trust of the international community, Japan must independently and proactively make efforts
for the peace and stability of the international community, which are prerequisites for Japan’s own peace and
independence.

In doing so, due to the unpredictable, complex, and diverse nature of today’s security threats, it is important

that the government take swift and appropriate responses through a systematic combination of security-related
measures, including those of public security, economy, and intelligence, and promotion of diplomatic efforts
in times of peace and effective operation of defense capabilities. Furthermore, it must engage in cooperation
with the United States, based on the Japan-U.S. Security Arrangements and promote cooperation with relevant
countries and organizations such as the United Nations.

Based on the abovementioned recognition, the National Defense Program Guidelines define the following

two objectives for security:
1) Prevention of threats from reaching Japan and, in the event that they do, repelling them and minimizing any

damage, and
2) Improvement of the international security environment to reduce the potential that threats will reach Japan in

the first place.

In order to achieve the two objectives listed above, three approaches—Japan’s own efforts, cooperation

with alliance partners, and cooperation with the international community—are to be combined in an integrated
manner. (See Fig. II-2-1-2)

To combat the threat of nuclear weapons, Japan will rely on the U.S. nuclear deterrent and at the same time

will play an active role in efforts for disarmament and non-proliferation of weapons of mass destruction such as
nuclear weapons and missiles.

**2. New Concept for Defense Capability (Shifting emphasis from “deterrent effects” to “response**

**capability”)**

**(1) Reviewing the Basic Defense Force Concept**
With regard to Japan’s defense capability, NDPG 1976 set forth the Basic Defense Force Concept. The concept
is designed to enable Japan to maintain the minimum necessary basic defense capability as an independent state
so as not to turn into a power vacuum and become a destabilizing factor in the region, rather than preparing to
directly counter military threats. NDPG 1995 essentially adhered to this concept.

The Basic Defense Force Concept was reviewed for the following two reasons in line with changes in the

security environment surrounding Japan.

These changes to the basic defense force are as shown in Fig. II-2-1-3.

**a. Effective Response to Contingencies**
Under the Basic Defense Force Concept, focus is placed on defense capabilities of an adequate scale in addition
to the Japan-U.S. Security Arrangements as preventative measures against potential invasion. Behind this idea
is the deterrent effect generated by a country that possesses adequate defense capabilities. However, new threats
and diverse contingencies are difficult to predict and can occur unexpectedly, such that conventional deterrent
effects that derive from the presence of a defense force do not necessarily work effectively. Therefore, future
defense capabilities are strongly required to have the ability to prevent such threats from surfacing, as well as
the ability to enable effective response to various contingencies and to minimize damage when such events do
occur.


-----

**b. Proactive Efforts on Japan’s Own Initiative for International Peace Cooperation Activities**
The Basic Defense Force Concept is based on the assumption that while it is internationally recognized that
efforts for stable international relationships will continue despite the existence of unpredictable and uncertain
elements, at the same time, mutually cooperative and interdependent relationships among nations have been
advancing, and new threats and diverse contingencies are becoming increasingly difficult for a single nation to
resolve.

Under these circumstances, Japan, in order to ensure its security, must proactively participate in international

collaborative activities for the improvement of the international security environment (international peace
cooperation activities) on its own initiative by utilizing its defense capabilities. It has become difficult to build
defense capabilities solely on the basis of Japan’s Basic Defense Force Concept, which is focused on the defense
of Japan.

**(2) Multifunctional, Flexible and Effective Defense Capabilities**
With regard to future defense capabilities, the National Defense Program Guidelines state that the effective
portion of the Basic Defense Force Concept shall be maintained[5] under the new security environment, and that
in addition to responding to new threats and diverse contingencies effectively, there is also a need to participate
proactively in international peace cooperation activities on Japan’s own initiative.

In addition, while the expected roles of defense capabilities are becoming more diverse, a decline in the youth

population due to dwindling birthrates and a dramatic increase in the severity of Japan’s fiscal condition should
be considered as the country plans the future build-up of defense capabilities.

Based on this viewpoint, Japan’s future defense capability needs to be equipped with high responsiveness,

flexibility, and multi-purpose functionality, and to be supported by advanced technology and intelligence
capabilities in line with trends in military technology standards so that it can establish “multi-functional, flexible,
and effective defense capabilities” that can respond appropriately to various contingencies through flexible
deployment of SDF units and utilization of multifunctional defense equipment.

Thus it is necessary for Japan to shift the emphasis of its defense capabilities from pursuit of conventional

deterrence effects to acquisition of ability to respond to various contingencies at home and abroad.

Section 2. Contents of the National Defense Program Guidelines

**1. Basic Principles of Japan’s Security Policy**
As described earlier, there are two objectives for Japan’s security: to prevent threats from reaching Japan and to
repel them, and to improve the international security environment so as to reduce the chances that threats will
reach Japan.

Japan will achieve these objectives by combining Japan’s own efforts, cooperation with alliance partners, and

cooperation with the international community in an integrated manner.

**1. Japan’s Own Efforts**
Japan’s security depends first and foremost on its own efforts. Based on this recognition, it is stated in the
National Defense Program Guidelines that Japan will make its utmost efforts, utilizing all available means, to
prevent threats from reaching the country directly. The guidelines state that in the event that these efforts fail to
prevent the threat from reaching the country, the Government of Japan will take an integrated response by swiftly
making the appropriate decisions and bringing together all relevant organizations, such as the SDF, the police
and the Japan Coast Guard, and ensuring adequate cooperation among them. In addition, the Government will
establish necessary civil defense systems to respond to various emergency situations, and the central and local
governments will work together closely to establish adequate systems.

At the same time, Japan will engage in its own diplomatic activities to prevent the emergence of threats by

improving the international security environment.

The guidelines prescribe that Japan’s defense capabilities, which are the ultimate guarantee of national security,

shall be multi-functional, flexible, and effective, and that the improvement of efficiency and rationalization are
necessary in order to realize such capabilities.

**2. The Japan-U.S. Security Arrangements (Cooperation with Allies)**
The Japan-U.S. Security Arrangements are indispensable to ensuring Japan’s security, and the presence of the
U.S. military is essential for the maintenance of peace and stability in the Asia-Pacific region. Considering
the progress made in Japan-U.S. cooperation in dealing with global issues, as exemplified in the fight against
terrorism, the close Japan-U.S. cooperative relationship plays a significant role in the effective promotion of
international efforts to prevent and respond to new threats and diverse contingencies.

The Japan-U.S. Security Arrangements do not function simply because of the existence of the Treaty of

Mutual Cooperation and Security between Japan and the United States. In order to make this agreement effective,
it is essential to make continuous efforts in times of peace. From this perspective, the National Defense Program
Guidelines clearly specify the following efforts.

**(1) Implementation of Strategic Dialogue between Japan and the United States (Strategic**

**Objectives, Role-sharing and Military Posture)**

Based on the posture of Japan’s security and defense capabilities clarified in the National Defense Program
Guidelines, Japan will proactively engage in strategic dialogue with the United States on wide-ranging security
issues such as role-sharing between the two countries and military posture while working to harmonize perceptions
of the new security environment and the appropriate strategic objectives[6]. In doing so, the Government of Japan
will bear in mind the need to reduce the excessive burden on local communities which host U.S. military facilities,
while maintaining the deterrent capabilities that the U.S. military presence in Japan provides.


-----

**(2) Various Efforts for Strengthening the Japan-U.S. Security Arrangements**
The Japan-U.S. Security Arrangements shall be enhanced through active promotion of measures including
information sharing, various forms of operational cooperation and collaboration on ballistic missile defense
(BMD).

**3. Cooperation with the International Community**
The National Defense Program Guidelines state that in order to improve the international security environment
in cooperation with the international community and to help maintain the security and prosperity of Japan,
the Government of Japan will actively engage in diplomatic efforts, including the strategic use of Official
Development Assistance (ODA). The guidelines also state that based on the recognition that the destabilization
of the international community by events such as regional conflicts, proliferation of weapons of mass destruction,
and international terrorist attacks would directly affect its own peace and security, Japan will, on its own initiative,
proactively participate in international peace cooperation activities as an integral part of its diplomatic efforts.

In particular, stability in the region extending from the Middle East to East Asia is crucial to Japan. Therefore,

the Government of Japan will strive to stabilize the region by promoting cooperative efforts in conjunction with
other countries concerned in order to deal with common security challenges. Japan will also actively engage in
U.N. reforms, as well as promote efforts for multilateral frameworks for security in the Asia-Pacific region such
as the ASEAN Regional Forum (ARF).

**2. Vision for Future Defense Capabilities**

**1. Role of Defense Capabilities**
In recognition of the new security environment, the National Defense Program Guidelines define the role of
defense capabilities as:
1) Effective response to new threats and diverse contingencies
2) Preparation for a response to a full-scale invasion
3) Proactive efforts, on Japan’s own initiative, to improve the international security environment

The guidelines state that Japan will efficiently maintain the SDF posture deemed necessary to carry out

missions effectively in each area.

NDPG 1995 clearly stated the maintenance of the defense posture of each branch of the SDF. However, the

current National Defense Program Guidelines adopt the idea that a new SDF posture should be formed in the
process of joint operations being conducted to respond to each contingency. Based on this concept, the guidelines
specify in a comprehensive manner, the role and response to be fulfilled in each contingency and the concept of
the SDF posture under “The Role of Defense Capabilities.”

**(1) Effective Response to New Threats and Diverse Contingencies**
The idea behind the response to new threats and diverse contingencies presented in the National Defense Program
Guidelines is as follows.

As new threats and contingencies are difficult to predict and have the potential to emerge suddenly, Japan will

effectively counter such changes by forming and deploying highly ready and mobile defense force units capable of
responding appropriately to the characteristics of each situation in accordance with the characteristics of the units
and Japan’s geographical characteristics. When contingencies do actually occur, the defense force will act quickly
and appropriately to seamlessly respond to the situation and in close collaboration with the police, the Japan Coast
Guard and other relevant organizations in accordance with the circumstances and the need for division of labor.

Major responses to new threats and diverse contingencies are as follows.


-----

**a. Response to Ballistic Missile Attacks**
Japan will effectively deal with ballistic missile attacks by maintaining a system to counter such attacks, including
a BMD system, to be established at an early date.

Japan will appropriately deal with nuclear threats through efforts to build the BMD system as well as relying

on the U.S. nuclear deterrent. (See Part III, Chapter 1, Section 2-1)

**b. Response to Attacks by Guerillas or Special Operations Forces**
In response to guerillas and special operations force attacks, Japan will maintain the necessary defense force
structure to effectively deal with the situation by enhancing the readiness and mobility of defense force units, as
well as by coping with such attacks in a flexible manner, including swift and concentrated unit deployments. (See
Part III, Chapter 1, Section 2-2)

**c. Response to the Invasion of Japan’s Offshore Islands**
Because of Japan’s geographical characteristics, featuring many offshore islands, invasion of such islands can be
envisioned as one method of orchestrating an armed attack against Japan. In this regard, Japan must maintain a
defense structure which is capable of dealing with precise guidance attacks by transporting SDF units by sea and
air in a flexible manner. (See Part III, Chapter 1, Section 2-3)

**d. Patrol and Surveillance of Sea and Airspace Surrounding Japan, and Responses to**

**Violations of Japan’s Airspace and Intrusion of Armed Special Operation Vessels and Other**
**Vessels**

In order to effectively respond to new threats and diverse contingencies, early detection is extremely important
for the prevention of undesirable events, as well as the prevention of expansion if such an event should it occur.
Therefore, around-the-clock patrol and surveillance of the sea and airspace surrounding Japan remains a key role
of the SDF. For this reason, Japan will maintain a defense structure that includes warships, aircraft and other
equipment necessary to achieve this aim.

Japan will also maintain fighter aircraft units to respond swiftly and appropriately to the violation of

territorial airspace. Furthermore, in light of issues concerning armed North Korean special operation vessels
and submerged navigation within Japanese territory by Chinese nuclear submarines, Japan will take appropriate
actions against such spy ships in the waters surrounding Japan and submerged foreign submarines navigating in
Japan’s territorial waters. (See Part III, Chapter 1, Section 2-4)

**e. Response to Large-Scale and Special Disasters**
In the event of a large-scale natural disaster or a special disaster such as a nuclear disaster, it is of extreme
importance that Japan utilize the capabilities of the SDF to ensure the security of the people. For situations in
which protection of life or property are necessary, Japan will maintain an adequate force structure consisting of
defense force units and personnel with specialized abilities and expertise with the ability to undertake disaster
relief operations throughout Japan. (See Part III, Chapter 1, Section 2-5)

**(2) Preparations for Full-Scale Invasion**
While the likelihood of full-scale invasion is declining, new defense capabilities are required for Japan to
effectively respond to new threats and diverse contingencies. Proactive engagement is also required of Japan, on
its own initiative, aimed at improving the international security environment.

In recognition of this security environment, the National Defense Program Guidelines state that Japan will

depart from the previous defense build-up concept that emphasizes so-called Cold War-type counter-armor
warfare and implement a sweeping review of its defense equipment and personnel earmarked for responding


-----

to full-scale invasion with an eye toward reducing
numbers.

At the same time, in light of the fact that the

primary role of defense capability is to respond to fullscale invasion and that the rearrangement of defense
build-up will require time, Japan will secure the most
fundamental element of its defense capabilities in order
to prepare for full-scale invasion. (See Part III, Chapter
1, Section 3)

**(3) Proactive Efforts on Japan’s own Initiative** Light armored vehicle that has been assaulted from the Landing Craft Air Cushion

(LCAC) during the Northern region training

**to Improve the International Security**
**Environment**
**a. Proactive Engagement on its Own Initiative in International Peace Cooperation Activities**
It is stated in the current National Defense Program Guidelines that Japan will proactively participate in
international peace cooperation activities on its own initiative with the objective of further ensuring the peace
and security of Japan, rather than simply “to make a contribution” as was stated in the previous version of the
guidelines.

The scope of international peace cooperation activities is extremely broad, and the Government of Japan as

a whole needs to be engaged in these activities in an integrated manner with diplomacy as part of the country’s
unified efforts. Within the framework of the Government’s overall policy, the SDF must be appropriately engaged
in international peace cooperation activities drawing on its self-sustainability and organizational capabilities. For
this reason, the SDF plans to establish the infrastructure necessary to quickly dispatch and maintain defense
force units overseas by developing education and training systems, maintaining a highly ready force posture for
relevant units, and improving transport and other capabilities.

In order for Japan to appropriately participate in international peace cooperation activities, it was determined

that necessary arrangements would be made including efforts to prioritize these activities within the SDF’s
overall missions. (See Part III, Chapter 3, Section 1)

reconstruction assistance in Iraq

-----

**b. Security Dialogues and Promotion of Defense Exchanges**
Security dialogues and defense exchanges including bilateral and multilateral training need to be continued in
view of the changes in the international security environment and in recognition of the fact that such efforts
contribute to the effective implementation of international peace cooperation activities. In addition, activities
which contribute to the peace and stability of the international community need to be actively promoted by
continuing the implementation of cooperative activities in the area of arms control and disarmament conducted
by international organizations such as the United Nations. (See Part III, Chapter 3, Section 2-3)

**2. Fundamental Elements of Japan’s Defense Capabilities**
Following are fundamental elements of Japan’s defense capabilities that are included in the National Defense
Program Guidelines, which are necessary to fulfill the defense missions described earlier.

**(1) Enhancement of Joint Operation Capabilities**
In order to execute its missions swiftly and effectively and respond to new threats and diverse contingencies
without delay in the new security environment, the SDF needs to enhance the joint operational posture so that all
SDF services can operate in a unified manner in such situations from the moment they arise.

For this reason, the Joint Staff was established and the infrastructure for joint operations was put in place in

such areas as education and training, and information and communications, and the SDF reexamined its existing
organizations for joint operations capabilities so as to enhance their efficiency. (See Part III, Chapter 1, Section
1-4)

**(2) Strengthening Intelligence Capabilities**
In order for defense capabilities to function effectively with multi-functionality and flexibility, it is imperative for
the Government of Japan to retain and utilize advanced intelligence capabilities, including the ability to detect
contingencies as early as possible and to collect, analyze, and share intelligence promptly and accurately.

Therefore, Japan will strengthen its advanced and diversified intelligence-gathering capabilities and enhance

its comprehensive analysis and assessment capabilities, bearing in mind threats in the security environment and
technological trends. Japan will also strengthen its intelligence structure, including the Defense Intelligence
Headquarters, which will play a role in supporting these capabilities, and in this regard, Japan will build a
sophisticated intelligence capability.

**(3) Incorporating the Progress of Science and Technology in Japan’s Defense Capabilities**
In order to realize multi-functional, flexible and effective defense capabilities, the fruits of various technological
innovations resulting from progress in information science and technology should be adequately reflected. In
particular, advanced command and communications systems, as well as information communication networks
shall be established to develop reliable command and control systems while the rapid intelligence-sharing systems
that are indispensable to the SDF’s joint operations described above will be enhanced in line with the advanced
information and communication technologies available in Japan and abroad.

**(4) Effective Utilization of Human Resources**
In order to achieve greater outcomes with limited human resources, it is necessary to recruit human resources
with high potential and train and educate them to adequately respond to increasingly diverse and international
SDF missions and to properly operate rapidly advancing high-tech defense equipment.

Research and education on security issues will be promoted together with a reinforcement of the manpower

foundation for promoting such research[7].


-----

**3. Specific Posture for Defense Capability**
The attached table of the National Defense Program Guidelines clarifies the specific posture for the defense
capabilities needed to fulfill the missions described above. The following provides an overview.

**1. Ground Self-Defense Force**

**(1) Formation and Deployment of Basic Strategic Units Responding to the New Security**

**Environment**

As regionally deployed units (basic strategic units), eight divisions and six brigades, which are responsive
and highly mobile, will be formed in preparation for effective and timely response to new threats and diverse
contingencies that are often difficult to predict. The eight divisions and six brigades will each be stationed in one
of 14 sections demarcated with consideration given to Japan’s geography, which is characterized by mountains,
rivers and straits. (See Fig. II-2-2-1)

**(2) Securing Personnel Resources (Manpower)**
**a. A departure from the conventional anti-tank warfare-oriented defense build-up concept will be pursued, and**

a personnel (manpower)-oriented system will be created in order to enhance the response to new threats and
diverse contingencies such as attacks by guerillas and special operations forces, large-scale disasters and
participation in international peace cooperation activities.

**b. To ensure effective response capability, the number of regular defense officers will be increased from 145,000,**

set forth in NDPG 1995 to 148,000.

**c. Meanwhile, the amount of primary equipment—tanks and artilleries—will be reduced from approximately**

900 vehicles to 600 vehicles for tanks, and from 900 to 600 artillery/vehicles for artillery, respectively. (See
Fig. II-2-2-2)

**(3) Formation of Central Readiness Force and International Peace Cooperation Activities**

**Training Unit**

In order to prevent the expansion of various contingencies should they occur, the Central Readiness Force will
be newly organized, consisting of Mobile Operation Units and various other specialized units. Within this force,
the International Peace Cooperation Activities Training Unit will be newly organized for proactive engagement
on Japan’s own initiative in international peace cooperation activities.

**2. Maritime Self-Defense Force**

**(1) Posture of New Destroyer Units for More Effective Response**
In order to secure as many well-trained destroyers as possible among a limited number of vessels and to enable
prompt response to diverse contingencies, destroyer units will be formed according to the level of training rather
than the conventional fixed formation.

Mobile Operation Units will be integrated into eight divisions (one division consisting of four vessels) to

enable swift and continuous response to contingencies. The formation of Regional District Units will be modified
so that one unit is deployed in each of five patrol districts in view of the current security environment.

**(2) Formation of Submarine Units Focusing on Response to New Threats and Diverse**

**Contingencies**

Submarine units will continue to retain a total of 16 submarines (units are to be consolidated, from six divisions
with two or three vessels per division to four divisions with four vessels each). The new formation of submarines
to be deployed in important maritime traffic points in the East China Sea and the Sea of Japan for information
gathering purposes is intended to detect signs of new threats and diverse contingencies as early as possible to
enable a flexible response.


-----

**(3) Improving the Efficiency of Combat Aircraft Units**
While ensuring the continued surveillance posture of the surrounding sea area, as well as its responsiveness
and effectiveness, the number of combat aircraft (including patrol aircraft, and minesweeping and transport
helicopters) will be reduced from approximately 170 to 150 as a result of consolidation of units and improvements
in efficiency.

For the fixed-wing patrol aircraft units, P-3C successor aircraft (P-1) with improved performance will be

introduced, and the current eight squadrons will be integrated into four squadrons for increased efficiency.
From the viewpoint of increasing operational efficiency, patrol helicopter units will be consolidated from eight
squadrons to five, and will be carrier-based, in principle.

**3. Air Self-Defense Force**

**(1) Improving the Efficiency of Fighter Aircraft Units**
Although fighter aircraft units will continue to be major units in order to permit appropriate action in a timely
manner against the violation of airspace, in light of the decreased probability of a full-scale invasion of Japan,
the number of aircraft will be reduced from approximately 300 to 260 by means of improvements in operational
efficiency.

The number of combat aircraft, including fighters, will be reduced from approximately 400 to 350 in line

with such developments as the downsizing of air reconnaissance units. (See Fig. II-2-2-3)

The Airborne Early-Warning Group will be reorganized from the single group described in NDPG 1995 into two
groups: E-767 early-warning and control aircraft units and E-2C early-warning aircraft units.

**4. Major Equipment and Major Units Also Available for Ballistic Missile Defense (BMD)**
The National Defense Program Guidelines state that the posture of the SDF must be capable of taking on
various roles to deal with diverse tasks. In particular, it has been deemed important for Japan to attempt to obtain
understanding for its BMD system both domestically and abroad by explaining the system as specifically as
possible and ensuring its transparency. To that end, the guidelines, in the attached table, specify “major equipment
and major units also available for ballistic missile defense[8].” (See Fig. II-2-2-5)

Note: Regarding the sufficiency of SDF Regular Personnel in the Mid-Term Defense Program, in order to effectively respond to new threats and diverse situations, and

for active and major participation in international peace cooperation activities, current levels shall be maintained, with a target of approximately 146,000 personnel.


-----

**4. Additional Elements for Consideration**
The National Defense Program Guidelines state that the following elements shall be taken into consideration in
building up, maintaining and operating defense capabilities.

**1. Fiscal Conditions, Procurement of Defense Equipment, and Maintenance and Operation of**

**Defense Facilities**

In light of severe fiscal conditions, defense expenditures must be curbed by further rationalizing and streamlining
of defense forces, and overall defense capability needs to function smoothly and efficiently through harmonization
of operations with other measures implemented by the Government.

In addition, the Government will make the following efforts: promotion of measures to curb the lifecycle cost[9]

of procuring defense equipment, implementation of effective and efficient research and development activities,
as well as the allocation of limited resources to core technological fields for the establishment of a truly necessary
defense production system and technological foundation.

In order to efficiently maintain and upgrade Japan’s defense-related facilities, the Government will take

various measures to promote more harmonious coexistence between these facilities and the local communities.

**2. Time frame for Achieving Defense Capability Objectives and Its Review**
The National Defense Program Guidelines provide a clear vision for Japan’s defense capabilities for the next
decade, based on the idea that it is important to set a concrete timeline for achieving the goals of defense
capabilities more clearly.

In addition, in a report of the Council on Security and Defense Capabilities, it was recommended that, “taking

into consideration the continuously changing security environment and ever-advancing technological trends,
Japan should continually and flexibly review” its defense vision, and therefore it was deemed desirable for Japan
to review its defense vision on a regular basis in line with the security environment and technological changes.
As such, the National Defense Program Guidelines will be reviewed and, if necessary, will be revised after five
years or should there be a significant change in the security environment, taking into consideration such change
in the environment, technological progress and other relevant factors at the time.

**5. Three Principles on Arms Exports**
A statement by the Chief Cabinet Secretary released at the time of the formulation of the National Defense
Program Guidelines addressed issues related to arms export control. It stated that given the fact that ballistic
missile defense (BMD) would contribute to the effective implementation of the Japan-U.S. Security Arrangements
and from the viewpoint of contributing to the security of Japan, the Government would exempt items related
to BMD systems from the regulations of the Three Principles on Arms Exports and related provisions, on the
condition that those items would be subject to strict export control[10]. (See Reference 10 - 11)

In addition, with regard to cases of joint development and production with the United States as well as cases

seen as contributing to counterterrorism and counter-piracy, regarding which questions were raised through the
process of developing the National Defense Program Guidelines, it mentioned that the Government would decide
whether to take any actions in the future on a case-by-case basis, taking into consideration the basic principle as
a peace-loving nation of avoiding exacerbation of international conflicts[11].

The statement by the Chief Cabinet Secretary clarified that Japan would continue to firmly maintain its policy

of dealing carefully with arms export control in light of the country’s basic philosophy as a peaceful country,
which is the basis for the Three Principles on Arms Exports and their related policy guidelines.

Section 3. Mid-Term Defense Program

National defense is vital to a country’s existence. Therefore, although defense build-up ultimately occurs in
accordance with the budget of each fiscal year, defense should be built-up continuously, systematically and steadily
based on the security environment surrounding Japan and the role of defense capability in line with a concrete
medium-term outlook because research and development of defense equipment, its adoption, improvement of
facilities, education of defense personnel, and training of SDF units cannot be realized in the short term.

Therefore, since FY 1986 the Government of Japan has formulated mid-term defense programs, each covering

five years, and has built-up the nation’s defense capabilities each fiscal year based on these programs.

The “Mid-Term Defense Program (FY 2005-FY 2009)” is a plan that defines Japan’s policy regarding

the build-up of its defense capabilities and the main projects for the five-year period to realize new defense
capabilities specified in the National Defense Program Guidelines. The program was approved by the Security
Council and the Cabinet in December 2004. (See Reference 9)

This section explains the policies envisaged under the Mid-Term Defense Program, organizational reviews

of the Defense Ministry and the SDF, main projects related to the SDF’s capability and measures intended to
reinforce the Japan-U.S. Security Agreements.

**1. Policies for the Program**
In line with the National Defense Program Guidelines, the Mid-Term Defense Program has shifted its priority
from “deterrence by presence” to “effective response,” and has placed emphasis on the improvement of readiness
and mobility, an integrated operation of the GSDF, the MSDF and the ASDF through their joint operations, and
the acquisition of new capabilities in line with technological development. Six policies, listed below, form the
basis of the program intended to build-up Japan’s defense capability in an appropriate manner.
1) Establishment of multi-functional, flexible and effective defense capabilities
2) Organizational reviews of the Defense Ministry and SDF
3) Enhancement of fundamental defense capabilities through joint operations and strengthening of intelligence

functions
4) Promotion of various measures that support defense capabilities, such as rational and efficient procurement of

defense equipment
5) Further strengthening of the Japan-U.S. Security Arrangements
6) Efforts to streamline and increase efficiency of defense capabilities

**2. Organizational Review of the Defense Ministry and SDF**
The Mid-Term Defense Program calls for an organizational review of the Defense Ministry and the SDF, as
shown below, as a means of swiftly and efficiently transforming their structure into one in which new defense
capabilities specified under the National Defense Program Guidelines can be acquired.
1) Ideal structure of internal bureaus will be studied in order to improve and strengthen organizations in charge

of administrative defense policies, and necessary steps will be taken.
2) The Joint Staff will be established and the Staff Offices of the three SDF services will be reorganized in order

to reinforce the joint operations system. Based on the achievement of the joint operations, evaluations of
operations will be undertaken and measures necessary to increase effectiveness will be taken.

The Defense Intelligence Headquarters will be placed under the direct authority of the Director-General of the
Defense Agency at the time.
3) The GSDF, the MSDF, and the ASDF will shift to the structure shown in Fig. II-2-2-5 under the previous

section following the conclusion of the Mid-Term Defense Program.


-----

**3. Main Projects Concerning Capabilities of the SDF**
Concerning the SDF’s defense capabilities, the Mid-Term Defense Program calls for effective response to
new threats and diverse contingencies, preparations against full-scale invasion of Japan, proactive efforts on
Japan’s own initiative to help improve the international security environment, promotion of fundamental defense
capabilities, and various measures that support such capabilities. Under the program, the main projects as shown
in Fig. II-2-3-1 will be implemented in order to achieve these goals.

**4. Measures to Strengthen the Japan-U.S. Security Arrangements**
Under the new security environment, the following measures will be taken in order to further strengthen the
Japan-U.S. Security Arrangements and the close relationship with the United States which is backed by the
arrangements.
1) Exchange of information and views on the international situation will be enhanced, and strategic dialogue on

the general security situation will be continued.
2) Efforts will be made to establish an effective cooperative framework in the field of defense operations. In

addition, joint exercises and training will be enhanced.
3) Cooperation in the field of ballistic missile defense (BMD) will be further promoted.
4) Efforts will be made to promote wide-ranging mutual exchanges in the fields of defense equipment and

technologies.
5) Measures will be taken to allow smooth and effective stationing of U.S. forces in Japan.
6) Japan will proactively participate in international security efforts and will take measures to enable close

collaboration with the United States.

**5. Scale of Build-up and Necessary Budget**

**1. Scale of Build-up**
Fig. II-2-3-2 shows the specific scale of the build-up of main defense equipment needed for the aforementioned
main projects being undertaken to improve the SDF’s defense capabilities.

**2. Necessary Budget**
The total amount of defense-related expenditures required for the implementation of the Mid-Term Defense
Program shall not exceed about ¥24.24 trillion under FY 2004 prices. Defense-related expenditures earmarked
for each year are to be determined within the framework of the sum listed above, while further efforts are to
be made to promote efficient and streamlined defense operations in harmony with other measures taken by the
Government of Japan. An additional budget of up to ¥100 billion may be allotted as necessary in order to address
various conditions including the need to respond to unforeseen events in the future if said budget is approved by
the Security Council.

In addition, the Mid-Term Defense Program will be reviewed three years after its formulation if deemed

necessary after taking into account the international situation and other developments.

Although there have been various changes to the situation since the implementation of the Mid-Term Defense

Program, including the modernization of defense capabilities in countries surrounding Japan, discussions are
being held at such fora as the Council for Reforming the Ministry of Defense, and it was decided that, as it would
be appropriate to take these situations into account when considering the future Mid-Term Defense Program, no
revisions to the program would be made at the end of last year. (See Fig. II-2-3-3 & 4) (See Part IV, Section 1)

Section 4. Build-up of Defense Capability for FY 2008

In FY 2008, taking into account the security environment surrounding Japan, modernization of Japan’s defense
capability will be initiated with the acquisition of fixed-wing patrol aircraft (P-1) and the modernization and
upgrading of fighters. Japan will take into account efficiency and level of priority as it advances the build-up of
defense capabilities. Continuing emphasis will be placed on the establishment of organizations to enhance policy
planning functions and counter-security functions; efforts towards the peace and stability of the international

**COMMENTARY**

**New Equipment (Successor Fixed-Wing Patrol Aircraft)**

The Maritime Self-Defense Force’s inventory of fixed-wing patrol aircraft (P-3C) is expected to be reduced
below the designated number in FY 2011 and beyond. In response, the annual budget for FY 2008 will
start the procurement of the successor fixed-wing patrol aircraft (P-1) with improved flight and search
capabilities and reduced noise. As an attempt for economical procurement, four planes are planned to be
produced in a lump, which are otherwise divided
into two fiscal years.

This planned procurement will enhance the

capabilities of: 1) responding to reduced noise
and reverberation of foreign submarines; and 2)
detecting and identifying small objects on the
water, such as suspicious vessels. In these ways
the procurement will contribute to the imminent
task of ensuring the safety of the seas.

Section 5. Defense-Related Expenditures

**1. Defense-Related Expenditures and Changes**
Defense-related expenditures include spending for maintaining and managing the SDF, improving living
conditions in the neighborhoods of defense facilities, and supporting U.S. forces stationed in Japan.

The defense-related budget on an expenditure basis for FY 2008 decreased by ¥38.9 billion or 0.8% from

the preceding fiscal year for the sixth consecutive year, under the Government’s policy to firmly implement the
Integrated Reform of Expenditures and Revenues as stipulated in “Basic Policy 2006[12].” (The budget shown
in above excludes costs related to the Special Action Committee on Okinawa (SACO) and the U.S. forces
realignment-related expenses (portion meant to reduce burden on local communities)).

Including ¥18 billion in SACO-related expenses and ¥19.1 billion in expenses related to realignment of U.S.

forces (portion meant to reduce burden on local communities), Japan’s total defense-related expenditures for
FY 2008 amount to ¥4,779.6 billion, representing a decrease of 0.5% or ¥21.7 billion from the preceding fiscal
year[13]. (See Fig. II-2-5-1 & 2) (See Reference 18-19)

**2. Breakdown of Defense-Related Expenditures**
Defense-related expenditures are broadly classified into “personnel and food provisions expenses,” which
cover such items as pay and meals for SDF personnel, and “material expenses,” which finance the repair and
maintenance of equipment, purchase of fuel, the education and training of SDF personnel, and the procurement
of equipment and others. Material expenses are further classified into “obligatory outlay expenses[14],” which are
paid under contracts concluded in previous fiscal years, and “general material expenses,” which are paid under
current-year contracts. (See Fig. II-2-5-3)

Notes: 1. Obligatory outlay expenses are the portions of past contracts to be paid that fiscal year.
2. General material expenses are items contracted and paid that fiscal year, and advance payments for payments over several

years for items contracted that fiscal year.

The Ministry of Defense terms this classification method as “classification by expenses.”
Personnel and food provisions expenses and obligatory outlay expenses, both of which are mandatory

expenses, account for 80% or more of the total defense-related budget. A breakdown of general material expenses
shows that ongoing or mandatory costs account for a significant portion of the total, including the repair of
equipment, education and training of SDF personnel, cost-sharing for the stationing of USFJ, and expenses
related to measures to alleviate the burden on local communities hosting U.S. bases in Japan[15].

Personnel and food provisions expenses decreased by ¥7.5 billion (0.4%) from the previous fiscal year.

Obligatory outlay expenses for the year decreased by ¥43.8 billion or 2.5% from the previous year while general
material expenses rose by ¥12.3 billion or 1.3% from the previous year.

The breakdown of FY 2008 defense-related expenditures classified by organization, such as the GSDF,

MSDF, and ASDF, and also by use, such as personnel and food provisions expenses, and equipment and material
purchase expenses is shown in Fig. II-2-5-4. (See Reference 20)

Thus, although Fig. II-2-5-5 displays the defense expenditures of each country shown in dollar terms using

the purchasing power parity[16] of each country as published by the Organization for Economic Cooperation
and Development (OECD[17]), there are limits to make a simple comparison between Japan’s defense-related
expenditures and those of other countries.

Notes: 1. Defense expenses are from each country’s public documents. The dollar exchange rate uses purchasing power parity (OECD publication).

US$1 = 124 yen = 0.645 pounds = 0.870 euros (Germany) = 0.915 euros (France).

2. Populations are from the U.N. State of World Population, GDPs are from the Ministry of Finance Major Economic Indicators in Foreign

_Countries, etc. Japan’s population is from the Monthly Report of Current Population Estimates (Ministry of Internal Affairs and_
Communications publication).

3. U.S. defense expenses are the narrow definition of expenditures, according to the FY 2009 Historical Tables.

**3. Comparison with Other Countries**
Understanding the defense expenditures of each country using a single standard is not possible in view of
differences in the socioeconomic and budgetary systems of each country. There is not an internationally unified
definition of defense expenditures, and breakdowns of defense expenditures are often unclear even in many
countries where such data is publicly disclosed. (See Reference 21)

Furthermore, though defense expenditures are generally converted into a dollar-termed value for the

comparison, defense spending based on this method does not necessarily reflect the precise value resulted from
counting each country’s price levels.

the joint Japan-U.S. technical research on a sea-based midcourse system of the BMD would be succeeded
by joint Japan-U.S. development in FY 2006. In a statement issued by the Chief Cabinet Secretary on the
same day, it was stated that “weapons required by the United States for the purpose of joint Japan-U.S.
development shall be provided under strict control and also upon coordination with the United States
regarding a framework for provision of weapons.” Following this statement, the Exchange of Notes
concerning the Transfer of Arms and Military Technologies was concluded by the Japanese and U.S.
Governments in June of 2006. The exchange provides a framework for enabling the transfer of weapons
and weapons technologies designed for the joint Japan-U.S. BMD development, as well as weapon
technologies that were subject to transfer under the previous Exchange of Notes concerning the Transfer of
Military Technologies. (See Part III, Chapter 1, Section 2-1 and Part III, Chapter 2, Section 3-5)

Secretary stated that the transfer of the patrol vessels was exempted from the Three Principles on Arms
Export on the condition that an international agreement is concluded with the recipient country to ensure
that the vessels are not used for purposes other than controlling and preventing terrorism and piracy and that
the country does not transfer the vessels to a third party without Japan’s prior consent.

2006).
13) In the budget for FY 2008, a change in recording method was enacted from the viewpoint of clarifying the

overall debt burden and payment amount for first-time expenses (expenditures for production facilities that
must be prepared for creation of necessary equipment, etc.), so that first-time expenses related to equipment
of which procurements start from FY 2008 and equipment of which procurements have started in FY 2007
and earlier are conducted in FY 2008 are bracketed together and recorded as act of bearing liabilities with
national treasury funds.
14) Procurement of some main front-line defense equipment, such as vessels and aircraft, and construction

of accommodations for SDF personnel, take several years. Budgeting for such activities is made to allow
execution of contracts basically within five years. Based on such budgeting, MOD and contractors conclude
a contract which allows MOD to pay contractors at a specified time in the future. The total budget amount
for the contract will then be split into several portions over the years, and expenses for payment will be
budgeted in each year. Expenses budgeted in the fiscal year when their payment to the contractor becomes
necessary several years after the conclusion of the contract are called “obligatory outlay expenses,” while
expenses for which the payment period has yet to come are termed “expenses carried over to following
fiscal years.”

Responses to Diverse Situations

**Section 2. Effective Responses to New Threats and Diverse Contingencies**
**Section 3. Preparation against Full-Scale Aggression**


-----

Section 1. Frameworks for Responses to Armed Attack Situations

It is of utmost importance for the national government to establish a basis for SDF activities such as a legislative
structure and SDF operational structure, to deal with serious situations which threaten the peace and security of
the country and its people, such as armed attacks against Japan. This establishment enables an effective response
to armed attack situations and anticipated situations (both to armed attack situations[1] and to situations where
armed attacks are anticipated[2]; the same applies hereinafter) and contributes to the deterrence of an armed attack,
and is also vital from the perspective of achieving civilian control in an armed attack situation.

This section outlines the key aspects of Japan’s response framework in the event of an armed attack situation,

and the SDF operational structure that is based on this framework.

**1. The Basic Framework for Responses to Armed Attack Situations**

**1. The Background to Laws for Responses to Armed Attack Situations**
The 1954 enactment of the Defense Agency Establishment Law and the Self-Defense Forces Law established
a fundamental legislative framework for Japan’s response to armed attack situations. However, many areas that
required additional legislation remained.

In 1977, with the approval of then Prime Minister Takeo Fukuda and following instructions from Asao

Mihara, then Director General of the Defense Agency, the Defense Agency at that time launched studies on
so-called “emergency legislation,” with the goal of addressing issues not covered by the existing legislation.
These studies continued for almost a quarter of a century.

In February 2002, then Prime Minister Junichiro Koizumi made it clear in his policy statement that specific

legislative reforms were to be made “towards a strong country in times of emergencies.” Following this policy
statement, the Diet enacted three laws related to responses to armed attacks starting with the emergency legislation
to deal with an armed attack situation in Japan, the “legislation for responses to situations.” The following year
in 2004, the Diet enacted an additional seven laws related to legislation for responses to emergency situations,
including the Law Concerning Measures for Protection of the Civilian Population in Armed Attack Situations[3]
(the Civil Protection Law) and with the additional ratification of three international treaties, the foundation for
emergency legislation was established[4]. (See Fig. III-1-1-1)

**2. Responses to Armed Attack Situations**
The Armed Attack Situation Response Law[5] determines the fundamental nature of Japan’s response to armed
attack situations and defines basic principles, basic policies (the Basic Response Plan) and the responsibilities
of national and local governments in the event of an armed attack situation. Based on this legislation and on
other emergency legislation, such as the Civil Protection Law, the relevant organizations (designated government
institutions, local governments and designated public institutions[6]) mutually cooperate to implement coordinated
response measures. The establishment of this legislative framework enables the country as a whole to implement
a thorough response to armed attack situations. (See Fig. III-1-1-2)

Notes: 1. The Task Force will be established in the Cabinet for general advancement of measures to respond to armed attack situations and anticipated situations.
2. For the Prime Minister to issue a defense operations order requires the process of a separate Cabinet decision and Diet approval, in addition to that

concerning the basic response plan.
In emergency circumstances and if there is no time to obtain advance Diet approval, SDF mobilization shall be approved after the order.

(See Reference 22)


-----

**a. Measures to Bring Armed Attack Situations to an End Depending on the Progress of the Situation**
1) The use of military force, unit deployment and other activities conducted by the SDF;
2) Provision of materials, facilities and services and other measures to facilitate the smooth and efficient

implementation of the SDF and U.S. forces’ operations;
3) Diplomatic measures other than those described in paragraphs 1) and 2) above.

**b. Measures to Protect Lives, Bodies and Properties of the People, and to Minimize the Effects on People’s Lives**

and Economy
1) Warnings, evacuation instructions, rescue of disaster victims, emergency restoration of facilities and

installations, and other measures; and
2) Price stabilization, distribution of necessities of daily life, and other necessary measures.

At the point when the Prime Minister deems the response measures as no longer necessary or the Diet

resolves that these measures should be concluded, the Prime Minister must then obtain the approval of the
Cabinet to abolish the Basic Response Plan.

**(3) Responsibilities of the National and Local Governments**
**a. Responsibilities of the National Government**
Regarding the implementation of response measures, the national government, in accordance with the basic
principles, will respond to armed attack situations and take every measure by using all organizations and
functions.

**b. Responsibilities of Local Governments**
The local governments, which have responsibilities of protecting the lives, bodies, and properties of the residents
in its region will implement necessary measures in mutual cooperation with the national government, other local
governments and other institutions.

**c. Responsibilities of Designated Public Institutions**
The designated public institutions will implement necessary measures in the scope of their works in mutual
cooperation with the national government, local governments and other institutions.

**d. Cooperation of the People**
In light of the importance of securing the safety of the nation and its citizens, the people of Japan will strive to
provide necessary cooperation for implementation of these measures.

**(4) Authority of the Prime Minister for Response Measures**
Following the stipulation of the Basic Response Plan, the Task Force for Armed Attack Situations etc. (the Task
Force) will be established within the Cabinet with the Prime Minister as leader for overall promotion of response
measures. Appropriate Ministers of State will be appointed as Deputy Chief and other members of the Task
Force.

If the Prime Minister recognizes that there are obstacles to protecting the lives, bodies, and properties of the

people, and to eliminating an armed attack, when necessary response measures under comprehensive coordination
are not implemented, he may instruct the head of the local government concerned and other relevant persons to
implement the necessary measures.

In circumstances where necessary response measures are not implemented or if there is an obstacle to

protecting the lives, bodies, and properties of the people, in emergency response situations, the Prime Minister or
the Minister of State responsible for operations relating to the relevant countermeasure may take responsibility


-----

for and implement the response measures that the local governments or designated public institutions have failed

-----

**2.** **Measures Based on the Armed Attack Situation Response Law and other Relevant Laws**
Based on the provisions of the Armed Attack Situation Response Law[8] enacted in June 2003, an additional seven
emergency legislation related laws and three related treaties were established and approved during June 2004.
Additionally, in 2007, Japan concluded three treaties for the protection of cultural properties in the event of an
armed conflict and agreed on regulations for the International Criminal Court. As a result, a legislative framework
has been established enabling Japan to implement measures necessary for responses to armed attack situations.
The outline of this framework is as follows. (See Fig. III-1-1-4)

**1. Measures to Protect the Lives etc. of the People and to Minimize the Effects on the Daily Lives**

**of the People**

Japan established the Civil Protection Law[9], which prescribes measures for necessary items[10] to protect the
lives etc. of the people in armed attack situations. In addition, the Law provides for the same measures to be
implemented in emergency response situations.

-----

**2. Measures to Terminate Armed Attack Situations**

**(1) Facilitation of SDF Operations**
Japan enacted the Maritime Transportation Restriction Law[11], which enables the implementation of measures to
restrict the maritime transportation of foreign military supplies (weapons etc.) in Japanese territorial waters or in
international waters surrounding Japan.

Furthermore, Japan revised one part of the SDF Law which centered on the need to establish legislation for

so-called section one classification laws and regulations (those within the jurisdiction of the Ministry of Defense)
and section two classification laws and regulations (those outside the jurisdiction of the Ministry of Defense)
referred to in the “emergency legislation study.” The necessary special provisions were newly established for
the appropriate application of relevant laws, such as measures for the construction of defense facilities prior to
issuance of a defense operations order, provisions related to emergency traffic on issuance of a defense operations
order, or relating to the Road Law.

**(2) Facilitation of U.S. Forces Operations**
**a. Japan established the Law Related to Measures Conducted by the Government in Line with U.S. Military**

Actions in Armed Attack Situations[12], etc. (U.S. Military Actions Related Measures Law). In accordance with
the Japan-U.S. Security Treaty, it prescribes measures to be implemented so that U.S. forces may smoothly and
effectively take the necessary actions to terminate armed attacks against Japan.

**b. The Diet approved partial amendment of the Agreement between the Government of Japan and the Government**

of the United States of America Concerning Reciprocal Provision of Logistic Support, Supplies and Services
between the Self-Defense Forces of Japan and the Armed Forces of the United States of America (ACSA Acquisition and Cross-Servicing Agreement)[13]. The scope of application for this Agreement has been widened
so that it now additionally applies to responses to armed attack situations, the efforts of the international
community to contribute to global peace and security, and for disaster response measures. Also, the revision of
one part of the SDF Law has enabled the SDF to provide logistic support, supplies, and services to U.S. forces
implementing these actions. (See Chapter 2, Section 3)

**(3) Others (Coordination of the Use of Facilities of Ports and Airfields, Roads and Others)**
Japan established the Law Regarding the Use of Specific Public Facilities[14], ensuring that the SDF and U.S.
forces’ actions and measures to protect the people of Japan can be implemented appropriately and promptly. The
Law enables the comprehensive coordination of specific public facilities etc. (ports, airfields, roads, territorial
waters and airspace, and radio frequencies) that may be required in armed attack situations.

**3. Guarantee of Appropriate Implementation of International Humanitarian Laws**
(1) Japan established the Law Concerning the Treatment of Prisoners of War and other Detainees in Armed

Attack Situations (Prisoners of War Law)[15]. The Law was created to ensure that prisoners are always treated
humanely in armed attack situations and to ensure that prisoners’ lives, bodies, health, and dignity are always
respected and protected from any violations or threats.
(2) Japan established the Law Concerning Punishment of Grave Breaches of the International Humanitarian

Law[16] prescribing appropriate punishment for “grave breaches” of international humanitarian laws applicable
to international armed conflicts.
(3) Japan has established legislation to protect cultural properties during armed conflict establishing a system to

provide international protection for those cultural properties that can be considered valuable cultural assets
for the entire human race.


-----

(4) Japan established legislation to cooperate with the International Criminal Court which ensures the appropriate

implementation of International Criminal Court regulations.
(5) To coordinate the implementation of the necessary domestic measures that are provided by the above described

specific legislation for responses to situations, in 2004, Japan approved the Protocol Additional to the Geneva
Conventions of 12 August 1949, and Relating to the Protection of Victims of International Armed Conflicts
(Protocol I)[17] and the Protocol Additional to the Geneva Conventions of 12 August 1949[18], and Relating to the
Protection of Victims of Non-International Armed Conflicts (Protocol II)[19]. Also, three treaties relating to the
protection of cultural properties and the regulations of the International Criminal Court were concluded in 2007.

**4. High Readiness for Armed Attack Situations**
With the passing of the legislation for responses to situations, Japan has established a legal foundation but still
needs to confirm the legislation’s effectiveness and also ceaselessly strive to maintain the effectiveness of the
required operational infrastructure to ensure an appropriate response in an ever-changing security environment.

As part of these efforts, during peacetime, the Special Advisory Committee for Contingency Planning, under

the jurisdiction of the Security Council, will study responses to emergency situations, such as armed attacks,
terrorist attacks, or the appearance of unidentified vessels. In addition, it will formulate plans for the specific
response measures to be implemented by designated government institutions, local governments, and designated
public institutions in armed attack situations. The Council will also take steps to formulate role-related plans and
ensure that these plans are reflected into policies and operations.

The government also works in peacetime to utilize a range of opportunities to educate the public on all of the

important measures that it will implement to protect the lives, bodies, and properties of the people in armed attack
situations. Also, it verifies the effectiveness of its operational structure through methods such as training.

**3. Measures for Civil Protection**

**1. Measures for Civil Protection in Armed Attack Situations (Civil Protection Measures)**
All organizations and functions of the government will implement their civil protection measures based on the
Basic Response Plan provided for in the Armed Attack Situation Response Law and the basic guidelines for civil
protection in armed attack situations. Also, the country as a whole will give its unfailing support for all civil
protection measures implemented by local governments and designated public institutions.

Local governments will implement their respective civil protection measures based on the national government

policies, and will be responsible for the overall coordination of the civil protection measures to be implemented
in their jurisdiction. (See Fig. III-1-1-5)

**2. The Basic Guidelines for Civil Protection**
In March 2005, the government established the Basic Guidelines for Civil Protection (hereinafter the “Basic
Guidelines”)[20], based on Article 32 of the Civil Protection Law. The Basic Guidelines classify armed attacks into
four types: amphibious landing attacks; guerrilla or special operations forces attacks; ballistic missile attacks; and
air attacks. The Basic Guidelines also identify elements for consideration when implementing civil protection
measures in response to each type of attack. In addition, the Basic Guidelines define the possible scope for
civil protection measures that may be implemented by the national government, prefectures, municipalities, and
designated public institutions in such areas as evacuation, relief and disaster response and also provides for the
allocation of roles.

Designated government institutions and prefectural governments, etc. will establish the plan concerning civil

protection (the Civil Protection Plan) based on the Civil Protection Law and the Basic Guidelines. (See Reference
30-31)

**3. Roles of the SDF in Civil Protection**
In October 2005, the then Defense Agency and Defense Facilities Administration Agency, both designated
government institutions, established the Civil Protection Plan[21], based on Article 33, Paragraph 1 of the Civil
Protection Law and the Basic Guidelines. The Plan included measures to be implemented in full force by the
SDF to terminate armed attacks, a primary mission of the SDF. In addition, the Plan described civil protection
measures to be implemented within feasible range, relating to evacuation, relief support, and responses to armed
attack disasters.

**(1) Civil Protection Dispatch**
An outline of the provisions relating to dispatches for civil protection etc. is as follows.

**a. Dispatch Procedure**
For situations where it is recognized that a dispatch is required, the Minister of Defense may issue a civilian
protection dispatch order to dispatch relevant units to implement civil protection measures following a request
by a prefectural governor or the Task Force Chief[22]. (See Fig. III-1-1-6)

Also, when a defense operations order has been issued in an armed attack situation, or on the issuance of

a public security operations order for measures to deal with an emergency response situation, the Minister of
Defense may implement civil protection measures or emergency response protection measures without issuing
a civil protection dispatch order if they constitute a part of the consistent defense or public security operations
strategy.

3. Implement as required.

**b. Authorities**
Only in cases when police officers, etc. are not at the scene, the SDF personnel ordered for a civil protection
dispatch operation are authorized to execute the following measures: evacuation and other measures as prescribed
by the Law Concerning the Execution of Duties of Police Officials; crime prevention and deterrence; entering
premises; and the use of firearms.

In addition, only in cases when the municipal mayors, etc. are not at the scene, the SDF personnel ordered for

a civil protection dispatch operation are authorized to execute the following: evacuation instructions, government
business, specifying hazard areas, requests to local residents for cooperation, etc.

**c. Temporary Organization of Units**
For civil protection dispatch operations, special units may temporarily be organized based on necessity and SDF
ready and reserve personnel may be called to duty.

**d. Emergency Response Protection Measures**
The same provisions as measures in armed attack situations, based on the Civil Protection Law and the Basic
Guidelines etc., shall apply for measures in emergency response situations.


-----

**(2) SDF Measures**
**a. Evacuation of Residents**
The SDF will collect and distribute essential information, coordinate with relevant organizations, and provide
guidance and transport services for the evacuation of residents.

**b. Relief of Evacuated Residents**
Centered on measures for the relief of human life (search and rescue, providing emergency medical treatment
etc.) and following a request from the Task Force Chief or other authorized persons, the SDF will provide the
following supports: medical treatment, (transportation of the sick and injured), measures to support the lives of
the people when necessary (distributing hot meals, supplying water, transportation of relief supplies etc.), and
collecting safety and security-related information.

**c. Responses to Armed Attack Disasters**
The SDF will carry out the following response measures: confirming the extent of damage, providing monitoring
support, implementing measures for relief of human lives (search and rescue, provision of emergency medical
treatment etc.) preventing damage expansion (support for the evacuation of nearby residents, firefighting etc.),
and removing dangerous substances dispersed by nuclear, biological or chemical (NBC) attacks.

Otherwise, under the authority of the Prime Minister, the SDF will implement other important measures to

ensure the security of facilities such as those related to daily life (guidance and advice, dispatching units etc.).

**d. Emergency Recovery**
While implementing emergency recovery measures for SDF facilities and equipment based on a request from a
prefectural governor etc., support operations will be conducted including the removal of dangerous wreckage and
emergency repairs for roads and runways.

**4. Activities by the Ministry of Defense and the SDF to Facilitate the Civil Protection Measures**

**(1) Participation in Training for Civil Protection**
In order to appropriately and promptly implement civil protection measures in armed attack situations, it is
essential that all government ministries and agencies, local governments, and other relevant organizations
cooperate for the coordinated implementation of these civil protection measures.

In this respect, the Ministry of Defense and the SDF have actively participated and cooperated in civil

protection training implemented by relevant organizations or local governments, such as the Cabinet Office and
prefectural governments. The Ministry of Defense and the SDF intend to continue such efforts to strengthen
coordination and response capabilities. (See Fig. III-1-1-7)

**(2) Coordination with Local Governments in Peacetime**
During peacetime, the Ministry of Defense and the SDF closely coordinate with local governments etc. The
Provincial Liaison & Coordination Division was established within the GSDF Army Headquarters to achieve
effective implementation for civil protection measures through close coordination. To strengthen functions relating
to coordination and cooperation with local governments etc., a Civil Protection and Disaster Countermeasures
Liaison Coordination Officer post was established in each SDF Provincial Cooperation Office.

**COMMENTARY**

**Joint Training for Civil Protection**

Based on the Law Concerning Measures for Civil Protection in Armed Attack Situations (Law No. 112 of
2004), the Ministry of Defense and the Self-Defense Forces carried out joint training programs in connection
with measures to protect the people, which were participated in by the central government and local
municipalities. The programs were aimed at strengthening coordination among related organizations and
thereby enhancing capabilities for emergency response situations. In implementing the training programs,
emphasis was put on the following: the enhancement of SDF response capabilities; establishment of the initial
operation postures; strengthening of the coordination/cooperation postures among local municipalities, etc.;
confirmation of the implementation processes, etc. of the civil protection measures; and evaluation of the
training results.

The key training programs included simulation exercises performed in Kyoto Prefecture on October

25, 2007; field training in Chiba Prefecture on November 21, 2007; and simulation exercises performed in
Kagoshima Prefecture on February 5, 2008. These programs were participated in by: the Eastern, Middle,
Western Armies, etc. of the Ground Self-Defense Force; Maizuru, Yokosuka, Sasebo Districts, etc. from the
Maritime Self-Defense Force; and the Air Defense Command etc. of the Air Self-Defense Force.

**4. The Operations of the Self-Defense Forces**
On March 27, 2006, the Ministry of Defense and the SDF shifted to a joint operational structure, in which the
Chief of Staff, Joint Staff solely assists the Minister of Defense on SDF operations from a military expert’s
perspective. This has established the basis for unified SDF operations among the Ground Self-Defense Force
(GSDF), the Maritime Self-Defense Force (MSDF), and the Air Self-Defense Force (ASDF) in peacetime, and is
enabling the SDF to fulfill its diversified roles in an effective and prompt manner.

**1. Outline of Joint Operational Structure**

**(1) Basic Concept**
**a.** The Chief of Staff, Joint Staff develops a joint operations concept for the operations including the GSDF, MSDF

and ASDF, and solely supports the Minister of Defense on operations from a military expert’s perspective.

**b. The Minister of Defense commands SDF operations through the Chief of Staff, Joint Staff, and the Chief of**


-----

Staff, Joint Staff executes SDF operational orders.

**(2) Establishment of Central Organization Required for Joint Operations**
As a result of the shift to a joint operational structure the system for assisting the Minister of Defense by the Chief
of Staff, Joint Staff and the Chiefs of Staff of the GSDF, MSDF and ASDF is as follows:

**a. Sole Assistance by Chief of Staff, Joint Staff to the Minister of Defense on SDF Operations**

**from a Military Expert’s Perspective, and the Responsibility of Chiefs of Staff of the GSDF,**
**MSDF and ASDF for Building-up their Respective Units**

The Joint Staff undertakes the functions relating to those SDF operations that were transferred and consolidated
from the GSDF, MSDF and ASDF Staff. The GSDF, MSDF and ASDF Staff Offices continue to undertake
functions for unit maintenance, such as personnel, building-up defense capability, and education and training.

In addition, from the perspective of facilitating the smooth SDF joint operations through appropriate unit

operations, the Chief of Staff, Joint Staff creates medium- to long-term defense concepts and strategies, and
annual planning policies to clarify the requirements of the GSDF, MSDF and ASDF functions. Each of the Chiefs
of Staff of the GSDF, MSDF and ASDF will implement all measures in accordance with these plans. (See Fig.
III-1-1-8)

The information necessary for the SDF to carry out its operations is provided by the Defense Intelligence

Headquarters to the Joint Staff and the relevant units.

**b. Execution of the Minister’s Orders for SDF Operations by the Chief of Staff, Joint Staff**
The Chief of Staff, Joint Staff shall execute all ministerial orders relating to GSDF, MSDF and ASDF operations.
The Minister’s commands are executed by the Chief of Staff, Joint Staff when joint task forces[23] are organized
and even in situations where a single SDF unit is mobilized (for example, only a GSDF unit is mobilized) to
respond to the situation. (See Fig. III-1-1-9)

**2. Establishment of Infrastructure to Enhance the Joint Operational Structure**
Within the joint operational structure it is essential that the Joint Staff and each SDF unit maintain systems to
communicate commands accurately and to share information promptly. With this in mind, in March 2008, the
SDF Command and Communication Squadron was established to strengthen communication functions directly
linked to unit operations. Also, a wide-ranging and mobile information communications structure has been
created employing information and communication technologies available at home, overseas.

Furthermore, at the unit level, commanders[24] of major units who may be required to take command of a joint

task force will create plans for such force’s operations during peacetime. Also, they need to maintain a posture
capable of executing duties through training and other methods. For this purpose, staff from other SDF branches
are to be stationed at major command headquarters during peacetime to strengthen coordination between the
GSDF, MSDF and ASDF, and if necessary, another Joint Staff personnel will be dispatched to enable a flexible
joint operational response to a range of situations.

As the third year approaches since the shift to a joint operational structure, deliberation continues aiming for a

more effective one and necessary measures to be taken, while bearing in mind past accomplishments. This deliberation
includes topics such as the improvement of education and training, the SDF headquarter structure, development of
human resources to fit joint operations, and the necessity of common equipment for joint operations.


-----

**3. Placing the Defense Intelligence Headquarters under the Direct Command of the Minister of**

**Defense**

In March 2006, accompanying the shift to a joint operations posture, the Defense Intelligence Headquarters,
which had been under the control of the Joint Staff Council (at that time), became a special institution under the
direct control of the Minister of Defense. Its position and role was clarified as the central intelligence service for
the Ministry of Defense.

This change has enabled the intelligence organizations of the Ministry of Defense to strengthen the following

functions: to collect extensive intelligence from a more holistic perspective, high quality analysis based on the
needs of each government ministry and agency, and more prompt, accurate, and direct reporting to the Minister
of Defense.

**[COLUMN]**


**VOICE**

**Voice of an SDF Officer Working as the Defense Attaché in India**

**Masakatsu Tamaru**

**Colonel**

**11th Defense Attaché posted in India, GSDF**

I am working as a Defense Attaché at the Embassy of
Japan in New Delhi, the capital of India.

Are you familiar with the work of Defense

Attachés? In fact, our assignments are more diverse
and extensive than most believe due to the increasing
complexity of our world today which is full of active
mutual exchanges.

Here in India in particular, my tasks as a Defense

Attaché include: (1) participation in about 30 formal
events a year in my capacity as a representative of
Japan, held by the Government of India, its Department Colonel Tamaru and security staff of a survey team visiting Jammu and Kashmir
of Defense and military organizations of its ground,
naval and air forces, etc. This is a very important
task as it represents Japan’s diplomatic stance vis-
à-vis India, as Japan’s Defense Attaché in uniform,
together with his wife, joins other military officers
and their spouses from about 50 countries including
the United States, China, Russia, and the United
Kingdom. Attendance at such events is imperative as
a failure to participate in any such official event could
negatively impact Japan’s reputation, which enjoys
friendly relations with India. At the same time, more Colonel Tamaru (center) invites military officers from other countries to dinner
than 120 countries maintain embassies in New Delhi,
and many invite Japan’s Defense Attaché to events held in commemoration of national holidays and military-
related anniversaries. Again, absence from any such occasion would raise questions such as “Is Japan not
interested in participating in our country’s events?”


-----

(2) Secondly, the Defense Attaché is tasked with accurately informing Japan of the situation in India

and the surrounding region, in relation to the security of Japan and of the international community. To
pursue this task appropriately, various actions must be taken as necessary: visiting relevant sites; seeking
communication through interactions with groups of military officers posted from various countries and
through personal interactions with such officers (at dinners, etc.); and attending opportunities of opinion
exchanges. Furthermore as a Defense Attaché, I try to be alert to events that happen from day to day and am
available 24 hours a day, in cooperation with other embassy personnel and my family.

Additional tasks of the Defense Attaché include: (3) services related to Japan-India bilateral relations;

(4) services related to Japan-India defense cooperation (bilateral security dialogue; discussions between the
defense authorities; joint training, etc.); (5) services related to international peacekeeping operations etc.
carried out by Japan’s Ministry of Defense (advancing procedures and arrangements inside India); and (6)
securing the safety of Japanese nationals in India. Being stationed in India allows me to stay abreast of the
“movements of the new world,” which would be more difficult if I were in Japan. Combining the population
of India (the world’s second most-populated country) and China (the world’s most populated) makes about
2.3 billion people (compared to the world population of about 6 billion). This means that every third person in
the world is either from India or China. While the two countries have yet to solve their border dispute (since
the Indo-China border conflict of 1962), they are rising on the global stage not only economically but also
militarily as if the two countries were competing in harmony. Against this background, I was assigned to the
current post in 2006. As a representative of the Ministry of Defense and of Japan, I am determined to fulfill
my duties not only in the security and other relevant fields, but also for the sake of Japan’s national interest
(diplomacy). My family (wife and three children) support me in fulfilling my profession.

Section 2. Effective Responses to New Threats and Diverse Contingencies

The primary role of the National Defense Program Guidelines is to provide an effective defense response to new
threats and diverse contingencies.

This section explains the ideal role of the SDF in response to new threats and diverse contingencies under the

joint operations posture as well as issues on which the Ministry of Defense and the SDF have been working on
to date. (See Part II, Chapter 2, Section 2)

**1. Response to Ballistic Missile Attacks**
While various efforts have been made by the international community in recent years for the non-proliferation
of ballistic missiles and weapons of mass destruction, proliferation still continues. Further, in July 2006, North
Korea launched seven ballistic missiles reconfirming that the threat from ballistic missiles is a reality.

Against this background, Japan began developing a ballistic missile defense (BMD) system in FY 2004 in

order to improve readiness in response to ballistic missile attacks. Necessary amendments were subsequently
made to the SDF Law in 2005. In December of the same year, the Security Council and Cabinet decided to begin
Japan-U.S. joint development of advanced BMD interceptor missiles.

Furthermore, on December 18, 2007 (Japan time) a test was conducted in the sea off Hawaii’s Kauai Island

where a standard missile (SM-3) was fired by the Kongo, an Aegis destroyer[25]. The fired imitated ballistic missile
target was successfully intercepted outside the atmosphere.

With assignment of ballistic missile capability to the Kongo class Aegis destroyers, in addition to the already

deployed PAC-3 (Patriot Advanced Capability-3)[26], although limited, Japan built its own multi-tier defense
system against ballistic missile attacks. (See Fig. III-1-2-1)

**1. Japan’s Ballistic Missile Defense**

**(1) General Situation of BMD System Development**
**a. Basic Concept**
The BMD system has been developed by Japan following the Cabinet decision of December 2003 and serves to
improve the capability of the Aegis destroyers and Patriot systems currently maintained by the SDF. Furthermore,
with incorporation of BMD functions to the automatic warning and control system JADGE (Japan Aerospace
Defense Ground Environment), the basic concept is efficient execution of a multi-tier defense system with uppertier interception by Aegis destroyers in coordination with lower-tier interception by Patriot PAC-3 missiles.

**b. Configuration of the BMD System**
Japan’s BMD system employs a multi-tier weapon system to intercept incoming ballistic missiles at either the
mid-course phase or terminal phase using Aegis destroyers or Patriot PAC-3 missiles respectively. The entire
system consists of the multi-tier weapon system, the sensors which detect and track ballistic missiles flying
toward Japan, and the command, control, battle management and communications systems to systematically
counter ballistic missiles by effectively coordinating weapons and sensors. (See Fig. III-1-2-2)

-----

**c. Policy for Introducing the BMD System**
In developing the BMD system, existing equipment will be utilized from the perspective of developing an
effective and efficient system while reducing acquisition and maintenance costs. Beginning with capability
improvements of the aforementioned Aegis destroyers and Patriot system, an improved model of the current
ground radar system will also be employed in the area of sensors. In addition, the newly developed warning and
control radar (FPS-5)[27], able to deal with both conventional airborne threats (aircraft and others) and ballistic
missiles, has been introduced to be used concurrently with the improved ground radar. The same also applies in
regards to JADGE as a command, control, battle management and communications system.

**d. Development Status of the BMD System**
By the end of FY 2007, Patriot PAC-3 missiles were deployed to four fire units of the 1st Air Missile Defense
Group situated in the Tokyo area (Iruma, Narashino, Takeyama and Kasumigaura) and at the end of December
2007, the Kongo, an Aegis destroyer was equipped with SM-3. By way of continuing the development of the
BMD system, the Ministry of Defense and SDF have the present objective of constructing a system by 2011
to link the various types of command, control, battle management and communications systems, starting with
JADGE, four Aegis destroyers (with added BMD capability), 16 Patriot PAC-3 FUs[28] (fire units), four FPS-5
radars and seven FPS-3 upgraded radars (improved model).

In this fiscal year’s budget, a total of approximately 93 billion yen (contract basis amount, excluding initial

expenses) has been appropriated for BMD outlays for 1) enhancement and strengthening of the operational basis
by developing radar and establishing a system for radar maintenance, etc., 2) continued development of intercept
systems such as modifications to Aegis destroyers and acquisition of PAC-3 missiles.

**(2) Future Capability Improvement**
The proliferation of ballistic missile technology continues and the possibility remains that in the future, ballistic
missiles possessed by various countries will be furnished with measures to avoid interception, such as the use of
decoys to deceive intercepting warheads.

Furthermore, expansion of the defense coverage provided by a single system and improvement of interception

probability are also required in response to conventional ballistic missiles. Thus, it is essential to improve the
kinetic performance of interceptor missiles and undertake initiatives to advance the efficiency and reliability of
the BMD system.

From this perspective, with regards to the state of capability improvements for Aegis destroyers and the

Patriot system, from this fiscal year (after establishment
of the structure provided for the schedule of the
NDPG), the Mid-Term Defense Program states that
necessary measures will be undertaken following
consideration on the state of development in the United
States. In addition, a Japan-U.S. joint development
project concerning an advanced interceptor missile
commenced from 2006 based on results obtained from
Japan-U.S. joint technical research carried out since
1999. Moreover, efforts to improve future capabilities
are being made including Japan-U.S. joint research to
improve the capabilities of radar and combat command
systems. (See Fig. III-1-2-3-4) PAC-3 system and ASDF personnel

**2. Improvement in Legislation and Operations**

**(1) Legal Measures regarding Responses to Ballistic Missiles**
In response to the event that ballistic missiles or other objects[29] are launched toward Japan as armed attacks,
defense operation orders for armed attack situations will be ordered and the missiles will be intercepted.

On the other hand, in the event ballistic missiles are launched towards Japan and an armed attack situation is

not acknowledged, and no defense operation orders are given, the SDF may take the following measures giving
adequate consideration 1) to provide a prompt and appropriate response and 2) to ensure civilian control.

**a. When the Minister of Defense determines, based on pre-indications, there is a possibility that ballistic missiles**

or other objects will come flying toward Japan, the Minister of Defense may order SDF units to take measures
to destroy the ballistic missiles upon approval of the Prime Minister[30].

**b. Furthermore, in addition to the above, there may be cases where the situation changes suddenly, such as when**

almost no information is available concerning missile launches or when missiles are launched mistakenly
or accidentally and there is no time for the Minister of Defense to obtain Prime Ministerial approval. In
preparation for such events, the Minister of Defense may prepare emergency response procedures approved
by the Prime Minister during peacetime. Then, in accordance with these emergency response procedures, the
Minister of Defense may issue advance orders for SDF units, within a specified period of time, to destroy
ballistic missiles with Aegis destroyers etc. when they actually do fly toward Japan in order to protect lives and
properties in Japanese territory. (See Fig. III-1-2-5)

**Fig. III-1-2-5 Flow of Response to Ballistic Missiles**

|When the possibility toward Jap|that ballistic missiles may fly an is acknowledged|Col3|When the possibility of ballistic missiles flying toward Japan is not clearly acknowledged|Col5|
|---|---|---|---|---|
|If armed attack is recognized (Declared intent to attack, imminent missile launch) An armed attack situation is recognized and a defense operations order is issued Ballistic missiles etc. fly toward Japan Response SDF Law, Article 76 (Defense operation)|||||
||||Minister of Defense orders the SDF to take destruction measures in advance as provided in the emergency response procedure*||
|||||When the possibility of ballistic missiles flying toward Japan is acknowledged|


-----

**(2) Concept of Ensuring Civilian Control of Military**
Responses against ballistic missiles require a response not only by the SDF but also action by the government
as a whole, including alerting and evacuating the people for their protection, undertaking diplomatic activities,
information gathering by the departments concerned and reinforcing readiness for emergencies. Furthermore, in
the event ballistic missiles are actually flying toward Japan, destruction of these missiles by using interceptor
missiles is necessary. The Japanese government must assess the
possibility concerning missiles flying toward Japan by comprehensively
analyzing and evaluating the specific situation and international
circumstances.

In view of the gravity of such incidents and the necessity of action

by the Japanese government as a whole, Prime Ministerial approval
(Cabinet decision) and individual orders by the Minister of Defense are
required so that the Cabinet and Minister of Defense may sufficiently
fulfill their responsibilities. Furthermore, the participation of the Diet is
also defined with a specification in the law on ex post facto reporting
to the Diet.

Moreover, the Defense Minister drafted the aforementioned

emergency response procedures when Japan’s initial Patriot PAC-3 was
deployed in March 2007 and consequently amended the procedures
when the Aegis destroyer Kongo was equipped with BMD capabilities[31]
in December of the same year, and Prime Ministerial consent was

[31]

received for both. With this approval, Japan now has its own system The SM-3 launch (MSDF Aegis destroyer Kongo)
necessary for conducting prompt and appropriate responses, including
in the event of an emergency. (See Reference 27)

**(3) Operational Efforts**
**a. Responses to Ballistic Missiles through Joint Operations**
The destruction of incoming ballistic missiles will be conducted by a full combination of MSDF Aegis destroyers,
ASDF radar, the Patriot system as well as various command, control, battle management and communications
systems such as JADGE. With regards to operation of the BMD system, effective responses are being considered,
for example including the role of unified operations led by the Commander of the Air Defense Command,
together with preparation for various contingencies. Furthermore, the GSDF will play a leading role in dealing
with damage caused by the impact of ballistic missiles.

**b. Japan-U.S. Cooperation in Response to Ballistic Missile Attacks**
Further cooperation with U.S. forces in Japan as well as with the U.S. government is required for efficient
and effective operation of the BMD system. Related measures were agreed upon at the Japan-U.S. Security
Consultative Committee (2+2) meetings in October 2005, May 2006 and May 2007 which indicated the direction
for Japan-U.S. security cooperation.

Also, at the Japan-U.S. defense ministers meeting in November 2007, with progress in development of the

BMD system, both Japan and the U.S. agreed to advance cooperation with a focus on operational aspects. (See
Part II, Chapter 2, Chapter 3)


-----

**3. Missile Defense of the United States and Japan-U.S. BMD Cooperation**

**(1) Missile Defense of the United States**
The United States aims to develop a multi-tier missile defense system in which interception systems suited for
each of the 1) boost phase, 2) mid-course phase and 3) terminal phase of the ballistic missile flight path are
combined for complementary missile defense. These systems are being deployed as they become available[32].
(See Fig. III-1-2-6)

Japan and the U.S. have formed a close coordination concerning ballistic missile defense, and the missile

defense capabilities of the U.S. are being deployed into our nation step by step.

To begin with, in June 2006, the USFJ deployed a transportable radar for BMD at the ASDF Shariki sub

base (Aomori Prefecture) and in October 2006, Patriot PAC-3 missiles were deployed[33] at Kadena Air Base in
Okinawa Prefecture. Furthermore, BMD capability equipped Aegis destroyers have been forward deployed to
Japan and surrounding areas since August 2006.

The development of the U.S. missile defense capabilities into our country will serve to secure the safety of

the people of Japan.

-----

**(2) Japan-U.S. Joint Development of Improved Missiles**
In 1998, the government received approval from the Security Council of Japan and decided to commence JapanU.S. joint technical research on a sea-based upper-tier system (the current sea-based mid-course defense system)
from FY 1999.

This joint technical research carries out design, prototype and necessary testing of interceptor missiles with

higher capabilities than the sea-based mid-course defense system currently being deployed by Japan. So far, the
design, prototypes and necessary testing of four major components[34] have been conducted.

The Japan-U.S. joint technical research has completed verification of elementary technology and acquired

prospects for solving technical issues. In December 2005 the Security Council and Cabinet decided to shift to joint
development and to utilize the joint technical research results as the technological foundation for development of
interceptor missiles with improved capabilities. In June 2006, the Japanese and U.S. governments reached official
agreement on this matter. In the budget for this fiscal year, approximately 20.2 billion yen was appropriated for
the joint development of the future BMD system. (See Fig. III-1-2-7) (See Reference 26)

**(3) Relationship to the Three Principles on Arms Exports**
Japan’s BMD program consists of capability improvements to the Aegis destroyers and Patriot system possessed
by Japan, and does not conflict with the Three Principles on Arms Exports.

On the other hand, with regard to the Japan-U.S. joint technical development, which is aimed for improved

BMD capability for the future, it will be necessary to export arms concerned with BMD from Japan to the U.S., as
part of development. In accordance with the Chief Cabinet Secretary’s statement made in December 2004, it was
determined, when the transition to joint development was decided in December 2005, that the Three Principles
on Arms Exports would not apply under the condition that strict controls are maintained and a framework for the


-----

provision that arms required to be exported to the U.S. would be developed through coordination with the U.S.

In June 2006, letters concerning the provision of arms and arms-related technology to the U.S. were exchanged

which established a framework to provide arms and arms-related technology under tight controls—for example,
prohibiting use for other purposes and prohibiting the transfer to third countries without Japan’s agreement in
advance. (See Part II, Chapter 2, Section 2)

**(4) Strengthening Japan-U.S. Cooperation on BMD**
Since the decision was made to introduce BMD systems to Japan, efforts have been continuously made to
strengthen Japan-U.S. BMD cooperation.

As a policy for strengthening the Japan-U.S. Security Arrangements, the Mid-Term Defense Program

states the Government of Japan will strengthen Japan-U.S. bilateral efforts to enhance ballistic missile defense
capabilities and promote cooperation with the U.S. in the areas of defense policy, operations, and equipment and
technology. Furthermore, the Cabinet decided to exchange letters concerning BMD cooperation between the
Minister for Foreign Affairs and the U.S. Ambassador to Japan. Following the Cabinet decision, a Memorandum
of Understanding (MOU) on BMD cooperation was signed between the (then) Japan Defense Agency and the
U.S. Department of Defense in 2004.

Furthermore, in June 2006, the Minister for Foreign Affairs and the U.S. Ambassador to Japan exchanged a

letter concerning BMD cooperation which included cooperation on Japan-U.S. joint development.

**2. Response to Attacks by Guerillas and Special Operations Forces**
Since Japan is highly urbanized, relatively small-scale
infiltrations and attacks can pose a serious threat to
the peace and security of the country. Such attacks
may take various forms including illegal actions by
armed agents[35], which will be handled primarily by the
police, and armed attacks such as destructive actions by
guerillas and special operations forces which constitute
a form of aggression on the territory of Japan.

**1. Responses to Attacks by Guerillas and**

**Special Operations Forces**

GSDF personnel in the urban area combat training

**(1) Basic Concept**
In the event of an armed attack on Japan by guerillas or
special operations forces, Japan will respond by means of defense operations. Forms of armed attacks on Japan
include 1) destruction of facilities and attacks on people by irregular forces such as guerillas and 2) subversive
activities, assassination of important figures and raids on operation centers by regular forces such as special
operations forces.

**(2) Operations to Respond to Attacks by Guerillas and Special Operations Forces**
In operations to respond to attacks by guerillas or special operations forces, an intelligence gathering posture is
established to detect guerillas or special operations forces at the earliest possible time to be captured or destroyed.
It is important at this time to quickly gain control of the situation to minimize damage from assault.


-----

**a. Search and Discovery of Guerillas and Special Operations Forces**
Efforts will be made to detect transport modes of
guerillas and special operations forces, including all
types of vessels and submarines, at an early stage and
interdict them at sea by means including submarines
and destroyers and ASDF aircraft. When the possibility
of infiltration into Japanese territory by guerillas and
special operations forces is suspected, GSDF patrol
units will engage in warning and surveillance activities
in coastal areas. In the event of an infiltration, patrol and
air units will search and detect the guerillas or special
operations forces. Furthermore, as required, a guarding
posture will be established for the prompt deployment GSDF personnel in checkpoint training
of guarding units to secure key facilities.

**b. Capture and Defeat of Guerillas and Special Operations Forces**
In the event that guerillas or special operations forces are detected, combat forces will be promptly assembled in
the area to besiege them, upon which they will be captured or destroyed. (See Fig. III-1-2-8)

**2. Response to Armed Agents**

**(1) Basic Concept**
While the police assume primary responsibility for responding to illegal activities of armed agents, the SDF will
respond in principle as shown in Fig. III-1-2-9, in accordance with situational developments.

**(2) Amendment of the Self-Defense Forces Law to Deal with Armed Agents**
In 2001, the SDF Law was amended for the purpose of rapid and effective responses to armed agents with 1)
new provisions established for intelligence gathering prior to orders for public security dispatches as well as the
use of weapons in such cases, and 2) amendment of provisions for the use of weapons during public security
operations. (See Reference 28-29)

**(3) Measures for Strengthening Cooperation with the Police**
**a. Establishing the Framework for Strengthening Cooperation**
For the SDF to deal with armed agents it is important to cooperate with the police agency. Accordingly, in 2000,
the Basic Agreement concluded in 1954 between the (then) JDA and National Public Safety Commission, to


-----

provide cooperation procedures in case of public security operations to suppress mass violence was revised,
enabling its application to illegal activities by armed agents[36]. In addition, local agreements were concluded in
2002 regarding public security operations between GSDF divisions/brigades and prefectural police forces.

Furthermore, guidelines were jointly formulated with the National Police Agency in 2004 for dealing jointly

with public security dispatches in the event of armed agent concerns.

**b. Joint Exercises with the Police**
By July 2005, the GSDF divisions/brigades and each prefectural police force, which are parties to the local
agreements, had conducted joint map maneuver exercises to strengthen mutual cooperation at the local level in
preparation for dealing with armed agents. Based on the results of these table-top exercises, in October 2005, the
Northern Army and Hokkaido prefectural police conducted joint field exercises for the first time. Subsequently,
joint field exercises were held in FY 2007 between the 12th Brigade and the prefectural police of Tochigi and
Shiga Prefectures; the 10th Brigade and the prefectural
police of Aichi, Gifu and Mie; the 14th Brigade and the
prefectural police of Ehime and Kochi; the 1st Division
and the prefectural police of Shizuoka, Kanagawa
and Yamanashi; the 13th Brigade and the prefectural
police of Hiroshima, Shimane, Okayama, Yamaguchi
and Tottori; the 4th Division and the prefectural
police of Nagasaki, Saga and Oita; the 8th Division
and the prefectural police of Kumamoto, Kagoshima
and Miyazaki; and the 7th Division and Hokkaido
prefectural police. These exercises served to confirm
cooperation guidelines in the event of a public security
operation. (See Reference 70) Emergency transport training jointly conducted with the police

**3. Response to Nuclear, Biological and Chemical (NBC) Weapons**
In recent years, there has been strong recognition of the danger of NBC weapon proliferation and the means
for transporting such weapons, as well as related equipment and materials, to terrorists and rogue states. In the
event that such weapons of mass destruction are used, it is likely there will be indiscriminate mass casualties
and contamination of an extensive area. The sarin gas attack[37] on the Tokyo subway in 1995 and the incidents of
mail in the United States containing anthrax[38] in 2001 are evidence of the fact that these weapons have already
been used.

**(1) Basic Concept**
In the event of a so-called NBC terrorist attack in Japan which corresponds to an external armed attack, the
SDF will conduct defense operations and take all necessary action to defend the country and rescue victims.
Furthermore, in the event of an NBC terrorist attack which does not correspond to an external armed attack but
against which the general police alone cannot maintain public security, the SDF will conduct public security
operations to suppress the terrorists and assist victims in cooperation with related agencies. Furthermore, when
the incident does not fall under the category of defense operations or public security operations, the SDF will
conduct disaster relief dispatches and civilian protection dispatches to rescue victims and prevent damage from
spreading; support related agencies to conduct intelligence gathering concerning the extent of the damage;
decontamination activities; transport of the sick and injured; and medical activities led by the chemical protection
units of the GSDF and medical units of the ASDF, GSDF and MSDF.


-----

**(2) Initiatives of the Ministry of Defense and SDF in Response to NBC Weapons**
The Mid-Term Defense Program provides that the Ministry of Defense and SDF shall improve the capability for
responding to NBC weapon attacks. Specifically, the GSDF, which will play a central role in various settings,
has newly formed the Central NBC Weapon Defense Unit, under the Central Readiness Force able to operate
nationwide. Also, there has been an increase of chemical protection unit personnel, and improvement of all types
of protection equipment including chemical protection vehicles, decontamination vehicles, personnel protection
equipment and chemical protection clothes. It also conducts research and development on subjects including
NBC reconnaissance vehicles, portable automatic sensors for chemical agents as well as decontamination sets.
Furthermore, the GSDF has designated personnel to take initial action in the event of special-type disasters in
order to allow operations to begin within approximately one hour. The MSDF and ASDF have also acquired
protective equipment and materials to be used on vessels and at bases. (See Part II, Chapter 2, Section 3)

**(3) Response to Substances[39] Related to Nuclear and Radiation Weapons**
Substances related to nuclear weapons have various effects on the health of those exposed to them, even in the
event they do not directly damage the body. Thus, appropriate protection and exposure control is required taking
into consideration the characteristics of such substances.

To a certain degree, internal exposure[40] from inhalation of radioactive substances can be prevented through

the use of protective masks and clothing while external exposure[41] from radiation can be prevented through the
use of chemical protection vehicles. For this reason, although limited, activities by chemical protection units
possessing such equipment are possible. In this event, the SDF will conduct operations in cooperation with
related organizations including measurement of the contamination situation and transportation of the sick and
injured.

**(4) Response to Biological Weapons**
**a. Disaster Relief Dispatches in the Event of Biological Terrorism**
Biological agents have certain incubation periods so it is difficult to determine whether a disease is caused by
biological agents based on the initial symptoms alone. For this reason, in the event that biological agents are
dispersed secretly, anthropogenic causes may be suspected only after damage has occurred and spread. Thus, it is
anticipated that detecting biological terrorism before damage is caused will be extremely difficult.

In the event of an outbreak of such damage, medical institutions will assume primary responsibility for

responding to the situation and the SDF will be responsible mainly for decontamination, transportation of patients
and medical activities. (See Fig. III-1-2-10)

**b. Initiatives for Biological Weapons Countermeasures**
The Ministry of Defense and SDF are involved in all types of initiatives, including holding seminars for dealing
with biological weapons, with the objective of improving response capability through operations research.

Furthermore, in March 2008, the Nuclear Biological Chemical Countermeasure Medical Unit was newly

established in order to minimize damage caused by biological weapons. The unit is directly under the command
of the Minister of Defense and makes decisions on early diagnosis and treatment policy by utilizing the biological
agent medical laboratory units, and quarantining and accommodating patients suspected of infection.

**(5) Response to Chemical Weapons**
Unlike biological agents, the outbreak of injury with
chemical agents is generally fast so a rapid initial
response at the time of injury is exceedingly important.

With respect to chemical agents, the chemical

protection units of the GSDF are equipped to respond
to chemical agents through the use of their chemical
protection clothes and vehicles. The chemical protection
units and medical units of the GSDF dispatched for
disaster relief dispatches will detect the chemical agents
using detective devices, transport and treat victims,
and conduct decontamination and medical activities in
contaminated areas. Even when the situation does not

GSDF personnel conducting decontamination training

require SDF dispatch, as required, the SDF will lend
chemical protection clothes and dispatch chemical
protection unit personnel as liaison officials to the
relevant agencies.


-----

**3. Response to Aggression on Japan’s Offshore Islands**
According to the NDPG, the geographical features of Japan are considered vulnerable from a security perspective,
due to narrow lands, long coastlines and many islands. In particular, invasion of these islands can be anticipated
as one form of armed attack against Japan.

**Operations to Respond to Aggression on Islands**
In order to respond to aggression on islands, it is important to detect signs at an early stage through activities routinely
conducted by the SDF including patrols and military
information gathering. Response to this aggression has
many points in common with the form of operations to
deal with full-scale land invasions. However, if signs
of aggressions are detected in advance, operations will
be conducted to prevent invasion of the enemy forces.
When no signs of aggression are detected in advance
and the islands in question are occupied, operations will
be conducted to defeat the enemy.

In carrying out these operations, the mobile

transportation and deployment of forces through joint
operations is essential. The ASDF, GSDF and MSDF GSDF personnel conducting island training in the U.S.
will cooperate to swiftly concentrate troops to prevent
and destroy enemy forces.

**4. Warning and Surveillance of the Sea and Airspace Surrounding Japan and Response**

**to Violation of Airspace and Armed Special Operations Vessels**

In order for the SDF to respond swiftly to not only a full-scale invasion situation but also new threats and diverse
contingencies, it is extremely important to routinely conduct warning and surveillance activities in Japan’s
territorial waters and airspace as well as gather and process information required for defense. For this purpose,
the SDF is engaged in various activities directly linked to ensuring the peace and security of Japan.

**1. Warning and Surveillance in Sea Areas Surrounding Japan**
The MSDF patrols the sea areas surrounding Hokkaido, the Sea of Japan and the East China Sea about once
a day, using P-3C patrol aircraft. Furthermore, warning and surveillance activities are conducted with the
flexible use of destroyers and aircraft as required, such
as a surveillance to a possible missile launch. Thus, a
state of readiness is maintained for situations in areas
surrounding Japan.

As an additional measure, GSDF coastal surveillance

units and MSDF security posts conduct 24-hour warning
and surveillance activities in the major sea straits.

Flight monitoring of the MSDF P-3C patrol aircraft


-----

**2. Warnings and Emergency Takeoffs (Scrambles) in Preparation against Violation of Territorial Airspace**
The ASDF conducts daily 24-hour surveillance of Japan’s territorial and adjacent airspace using nationwide
radar, E-2C early warning aircraft and E-767 early warning and control aircraft. Furthermore, some fighters
are always kept on standby for immediate takeoff (scramble). When any aircraft suspected of violating Japan’s
territorial airspace are detected, scrambled fighters will approach them to assess the situation and monitor the
aircraft as necessary. In the event that an airspace violation does occur, an evacuation warning will be issued. In
FY 2007, there were 307 scrambles by the ASDF with an increasing tendency[42].

On February 9, 2008, a Russian Air Force Tu-95 violated Japanese airspace in the vicinity of Sofugan in the

southern Izu Islands and ASDF fighters were scrambled in response. (See Fig. III-1-2-11)

**3. Response to Submarines Submerged in Japan’s Territorial Waters[43]**

**(1) Basic Concept**
With respect to foreign national submarines navigating underwater in Japan’s territorial waters, an order for
maritime security operations[44] will be issued according to the Cabinet decision[45] of 1996, and the SDF will
request the submarine to navigate on the surface of the water and show its flag. In the event that a submarine does
not comply with the request, it will be requested by the SDF to leave territorial waters.

**(2) Measures in Relation to the Submerged**

**Chinese Nuclear Submarine Operating in**
**Japan’s Territorial Waters**

In November 2004, a Chinese submarine navigating
underwater in Japan’s territorial waters surrounding
the Sakishima Islands was discovered. In response
to this, an order for maritime security operations was
issued according to procedures determined by Article
82 of the SDF Law and the Cabinet decision of 1996 to
deal with the situation. However, it took a considerable
amount of time for the Japanese government to issue an
order for maritime security operations after receiving ASDF personnel boarding the F-15 fighter for an emergency takeoff


-----

information on the submarine entering territorial waters. Therefore, based on the lessons learned from this event,
the government established the following response plan.

**a. Response Plan**
(a) With respect to submarines submerged in territorial waters, as a general rule, measures will be executed
according to maritime security operations including requests to appear on the surface and requests to leave
territorial waters.

(b) When an incident occurs, the Minister of Defense shall promptly issue an order for maritime security
operations following the required procedures.
m For this purpose, when information is obtained on submarines approaching the territorial waters of Japan, it

will be shared within the government in the early stages.

m In the event a submarine does enter the territorial waters of Japan, unless there is any particular reason, an

order for maritime security operations shall be issued immediately.

(c) Even after the submarine leaves the territorial waters of Japan, maritime security operations shall be continued
for actions such as ascertaining the possibility of reentry and identifying the nationality of the submarine.

(d) Contact shall be made with concerned nations while necessary measures are undertaken.

(e) While taking security aspects into account, the status of the submarine navigating underwater in territorial
waters and actions taken by the government shall be explained to the public in an appropriate and timely manner,
including the announcement of issuing an order for maritime security operations.

(f) Necessary manuals (response procedures) will be shared by relevant ministries and agencies to ensure
implementation of the plan above.

**b. Enhancement and Improvement of Equipment for Responding to Submarines Navigating**

**Underwater in Territorial Waters**

The MSDF is enhancing and improving capabilities for detecting, identifying and tracking foreign submarines
navigating underwater in the territorial waters of Japan, as well as making Japanese government intentions clear to
submarines. It is also maintaining and improving capabilities for responding to submarines in shallow water areas.

**4. Response to Armed Special Operations Vessels**

**(1) Basic Concept**
The Japan Coast Guard, as a police organization, is primarily responsible for responding to unidentified vessels.
However, in the event that it is deemed extremely difficult or impossible for the Japan Coast Guard to respond to
a situation, an order for maritime security operations will be issued in a timely manner and the SDF will respond
in cooperation with the Japan Coast Guard.

Taking into consideration lessons learned and reflecting on the unidentified vessel incident off the Noto

Peninsula in 1999[46] and the unidentified vessel incident in southwest Kyushu in 2001[47], the government has taken
all necessary precautionary measures in order for effective and safe measures to be taken against unidentified
vessels, while the Ministry of Defense and SDF have strengthened cooperation with relevant ministries and
agencies.


-----

**(2) Amendment of the Self-Defense Forces Law to Respond to Unidentified Vessels**
The Self-Defense Forces Law was amended in 2001 to add provisions concerning the use of weapons in maritime
security operations following a review including legislative aspect, which focused on the state of weapon usage
authorization to stop unidentified vessels. (See Reference 28)

**(3) Enhancement of Equipment for Responding to Unidentified Vessels**
The MSDF took the following steps: 1) improved the speed of the new-type missile boats[48]; 2) established a
“special patrol unit”[49]; 3) equipped destroyers with machine guns; 4) furnished forcible maritime interdiction
equipment (flat-nose shells)[50]; and 5) improved the sufficiency ratio of essential military vessel personnel.

**(4) Measures for Strengthening Cooperation with the Japan Coast Guard**
**a. Development of a Framework for Strengthening Cooperation**
In 1999, the (then) Defense Agency and the Japan Coast Guard jointly developed the Manual on Joint Strategies
concerning Unidentified Vessels which made stipulations concerning information liaison systems, initial response
outlines and division of roles (joint response guidelines) before and after the announcement of maritime security
operations in the event an unidentified vessel is discovered.

**b. Joint Exercises with the Japan Coast Guard**
The Ministry of Defense and the Japan Coast Guard conduct periodic mutual training, information exchanges
and joint exercises. Also, cooperation is strengthened through joint exercises between the MSDF and the Japan
Coast Guard, based on the manual, in relation to pursuit and capture guidelines for unidentified vessels and
communication between the MSDF and the Japan Coast Guard.

A joint training exercise was conducted on March 12, 2007, on the open sea off Sasebo. (See Chapter 4,

Section 1)

**5. Response to Large-Scale and Unconventional Disasters**
The SDF conducts a variety of disaster relief activities
when such disasters occur including search and rescue
for disaster victims and ships or aircraft in distress, flood
control, medical treatment, prevention of epidemics,
water supply and transportation of personnel and
goods. Recently, the SDF has played a major role in
responding not only to natural disasters but also to
various other disasters.

**a. Dispatches upon Request (General Form of**

**Disaster Relief Dispatch)**

In principle, the SDF dispatches units for disaster relief upon the request of prefectural governors and other
officials in accordance with Article 83 of the Self-Defense Forces Law. This is because prefectural governors
and other officials assume primary responsibility for disaster control measures and are in a position to grasp the
overall condition of the disaster. Therefore, it is considered most appropriate for dispatches to be made upon their
request. Furthermore, in the event that a disaster has occurred or anticipated to occur in the near future, and it is


-----

deemed necessary to take emergency measures, municipal mayors may ask governors to request a disaster relief
dispatch by the SDF according to Article 68-2 of the Disaster Countermeasures Basic Act; Countermeasures
Headquarters (the Prime Minister). Furthermore, in the event that mayors are unable to make such a request to
the prefectural governor, they can inform disaster conditions to the Minister of Defense, or those designated by
the Minister. After receiving such requests from governors, the Minister of Defense can immediately dispatch
units as necessary.

In exceptional circumstances when the situation is particularly urgent and a request must be made immediately,

the Minister of Defense or those designated by the Minister may authorize a discretionary dispatch. In order to
render discretionary dispatches even more effective, the (then) Defense Agency Disaster Prevention Plan[51] was
amended in 1995 to establish the basis[52] for SDF unit commanders and other officials to order discretionary
dispatches.

**b. Earthquake Disaster Prevention Dispatch**
When an alert is issued based on the Law Concerning Special Measures for Large-Scale Earthquakes
Countermeasures[53], the Minister of Defense is authorized to order an earthquake disaster prevention dispatch
based on the request of the Director of the Earthquake Disaster Warning Headquarters (the Prime Minister), even
prior to the occurrence of an earthquake.

**c. Nuclear Disaster Dispatch**
When a nuclear emergency alert is issued based on the Special Law on Nuclear Disaster Countermeasures, the
Minister of Defense is authorized to order a nuclear disaster dispatch upon request of the Director of the Nuclear
Disaster Countermeasures Headquarters (the Prime Minister).

**(2) Flow of the Request for the Withdrawal of a Disaster Dispatch**
The flow of SDF disaster relief operations is shown in Fig. III-1-2-12.

**(3) Authority of SDF Officers in Disaster Relief Dispatches**
Under the Self-Defense Forces Law and other legislation, officers of units requested for disaster relief dispatches,
earthquake disaster prevention dispatches or nuclear disaster dispatches have the authority established in Fig.
III-1-2-13 in order to efficiently conduct disaster relief activities.

**Fig. III-1-2-13 Authority of Self-Defense Forces Officers in Disaster Relief Dispatches**

1. In cases in which no police officers are present, SDF officers may issue necessary warnings to people in the vicinity, and in extremely

imminent situations, may by themselves, or ask people concerned to take measures that are deemed generally necessary to hold or to
evacuate people who may be in danger at the site in order to avoid harm.


2. In cases in which no police officers are present, SDF officers may trespass into private land or buildings, if they deem it reasonably

necessary under the circumstances, in order to protect people’s lives, bodies, or property from harm, prevent greater damage and to
rescue victims.

3. In cases in which no police officers are present, SDF officers may remove unattended vehicles from streets in order to secure passage of

emergency SDF vehicles in areas to which access of vehicles other than emergency vehicles are prohibited or limited (excluding
earthquake disaster prevention dispatches).

4. In cases in which neither the mayor of the city, town or village involved, nor police officers nor Japan Coast Guard officials authorized

under the mayor’s proxy are on the scene, SDF officers may take the following additional actions (excluding earthquake disaster prevention
dispatches):
(1) Set up warning zones where there is a high risk of building collapses, landslides, or such occurrences, and issuing orders to restrict or

prohibit entry to evacuate people.

(2) Use land and buildings to secure bases for relief operations and communication relay stations required for airlifting emergency patients.
(3) Move or clear away buildings or other structures obstructing efforts in cases such as rescuing people trapped in collapsing houses.
(4) Recruiting residents or people present to engage in lifesaving rescue efforts, flood prevention and other activities, when there are

insufficient SDF personnel on the scene.

(See Article 94, 94-3, and 94-4 of the Self-Defense Forces Law as well as the Basic Law for Disaster Countermeasures.)

**2. Initial Operations Posture and Implementation Status of Disaster Relief Dispatches**

**(1) Initial Response to the Disaster**
Based on lessons learned from the Great Hanshin-Awaji Earthquake disaster, the ASDF, GSDF and MSDF have
designated units able to provide an initial response to ensure disaster relief operations are conducted promptly. As
of May 2008, the GSDF has designated approximately 2,700 personnel, 410 vehicles and 30 helicopters nationwide
to be able to respond immediately to disaster relief operations. The MSDF has vessels designated for emergency
dispatch at each base in addition to aircraft on standby alert and the ASDF is prepared with aircraft on standby alert.

Furthermore, in the event that information is received of the occurrence of a strong earthquake greater than level
5 on the Japanese seismic scale, the SDF will independently dispatch aircraft to gather site information and is in the
position to transmit this information to the Prime Minister’s Office. Furthermore, depending on the circumstances,
liaison officers will be dispatched to the concerned local public authorities for information gathering purposes.

Life-saving activities can also be conducted employing various ASDF, GSDF and MSDF equipment. In

October 2006, the ASDF established a new aeromedical evacuation squadron in the process of developing a system


-----

for promptly transporting patients in critical condition to distant locations in order to provide adequate treatment in
the event of a large-scale disaster.

**(2) Implementation Status of Disaster Dispatches**
**a. Transportation of Emergency Patients**
The SDF has traditionally used its aircraft to transport emergency patients from isolated islands and remote areas
with insufficient medical facilities. In FY 2007, out of a total of 679 cases of disaster relief operations, 467 cases
were for transporting emergency patients with the large number of 435 cases being dispatches to such isolated
islands as Nansei Islands (Okinawa and Kagoshima Prefectures) and the Goto Islands (Nagasaki Prefecture).

The breakdown of these cases indicates that elderly emergency patients were the most common, while

there were also cases of emergency transportation related to childbirth and accidents. Furthermore, in the event
that aircraft of other organizations are unable to respond, due to reasons including a short endurance distance,
emergency patient transport will be provided to vessels navigating areas of ocean far from the mainland.


**b. Firefighting Support**
In FY 2007, there were 120 dispatches of firefighting support, the second largest number of dispatches after
transportation of emergency patients.

Within this category, dispatches for neighborhood

firefighting were the highest in number, with 108
cases in FY 2007. The SDF units deployed throughout
the country are actively involved in neighborhood
firefighting in order to contribute to maintaining the
security of local residents’ lives.

Furthermore, upon the request of prefectural

governors for disaster relief dispatches, the SDF also
conducted aerial firefighting activities in locations
where firefighting conditions were difficult, such as
Japan’s offshore islands and mountain areas. (See Fig. GSDF UH-1 helicopter conducting firefighting activities for forest fire
III-1-2-14-15)

**c. Response to Natural Disasters**
On July 16, 2007, the Chuetsu Offshore Earthquake (magnitude 6.8) (“Heisei 19 (2007) Chuetsu Offshore
Earthquake”) struck in the Niigata region resulting in damage which included a fire of an electric transformer at
Unit 3 of the Kashiwazakikariwa Nuclear Power Station, collapsed buildings, landslides and water outages. The
GSDF 12th Brigade accepted the Niigata prefectural governor’s request issued on July 16, 2007 and in the period
until August 29, 2007 carried out activities such as lifesaving, nursing casualties, water and food supply and bathing
support. As of July 13, 2008, the scale of the dispatch was approximately 92,400 personnel, approximately 35,100
vehicles, 94 vessels and 1,184 aircraft.

Furthermore, the (then) Tokyo Defense Facilities Administration Agency provided technical support to U.S.

forces in installing air conditioners gifted by the U.S. government to the area struck by the disaster.

On June 14, 2008, an earthquake occurred with the hypo center in the southern inland region of Iwate

Prefecture, causing soil avalanche, blocked river channels, and water outage (estimated magnitude of 7.2) (“2008
Iwate Earthquake”). During the same day, the JGSDF 9th Artillery Regiment commander received a request from
the Iwate prefectural governor, the JGSDF 6th division commander received a request from the Miyagi prefectural
governor, and conducted the following activities: search for missing people, rescue of isolated people by helicopter,
water supply, food service, bathing support, and others. As of July 13, 2008, the total numbers of personnel, vehicles
and aircraft are approximately 23,990, 7,150 and 542, respectively.

**VOICE**

**Voice of SDF Personnel Working at the Joint Staff**

**Lieutenant Commander Hiroki Matsuoka**

**Operational Section, Joint Staff**

The Niigata Chuetsu Offshore Earthquake broke out
on July 16, 2007, two weeks after I was posted to the
disaster dispatch team of the Joint Staff. I was at home
on that day, for it fell on a national holiday (Marine
Day), but my long duty began when my daughter,
looking at a TV subtitle, said to me, “Daddy, they say
there was a big earthquake.”

Immediately after the disaster, SDF units

voluntarily dispatched members to the affected areas.
The Joint Staff was tasked with the coordination
of these activities as an efficient set of the SDF’s
disaster dispatch operations. To this end, the Joint Lieutenant Commander Matsuoka on duty (right)
Staff urgently summoned the required personnel
and strengthened its operational capabilities. I, too, rushed to the office and began work at the Joint Staff
Operations Room. Amongst the exchanges of loud voices, each member of the Staff pursued duties which
transcended the boundaries of the Ground, Maritime and Air Self-Defense Forces. Our operations proceeded
to grasp the state of the disaster on the ground and the outline of the troops’ activities, as well as to coordinate
each unit of the SDF troops in response to the needs of the affected areas, to ensure cooperation with other
ministries and to report to the Minister of Defense and the Prime Minister’s Office.

Various units of the Ground, Maritime and Air Self-Defense Forces were dispatched during these disaster

relief activities. Although I was an MSDF official, I was naturally required to seek cooperation with other
forces. Only two weeks after being posted to the Joint Staff, I was unable to immediately identify the names
of troops other than those of the MSDF, their locations and names of their equipment. In addition there
were abbreviations I had never heard of, such as “kin-san team” (kinkyu-sanshu team: emergent assembly
team), “kuronoro” (chronology: outline of the development) and “conference” (conference communication
system of the Air Self-Defense Force). Before coordinating troops, I exhausted a huge amount of energy to


-----

understand these terms. This hardship, however, paved a firm road ahead for fulfilling my future duties.

During the disaster relief dispatches, the three Self-Defense Forces joined hands to respond to the

situations, which allowed more than 4,000 SDF personnel to be working on site by the fifth day after the
outbreak of the quake, responding to the needs of the local municipalities. I am convinced that the joint
operations enabled the effective and swift deployment of the Ground, Maritime and Air Self-Defense Force
capacities. Therefore, it is my desire to continue the cross-border coordination of the three forces to better
respond to the needs of our people.

**3. Efforts Made in Peacetime in Preparation for Disaster Relief**

**(1) Cooperation with Local Governments**
It is important for the SDF to strengthen cooperation with local governments in peacetime in order to conduct
disaster relief operations promptly and precisely. Examples which can be given include enhancing information
liaison systems, integration of the respective disaster control plans and proactive participation in the disaster
prevention practices of local governments.

Further, the post of Liaison and Coordination Officer for Citizen Protection and Disaster Relief Operation

Countermeasures was created at the SDF Regional Cooperation Headquarters to work at ensuring cooperation
with local governments in peacetime. (See Chapter 4, Section 1)

It is important to strengthen cooperation with local governments to enable human cooperation which

utilizes SDF experience and knowledge in disaster prevention operations. As such, upon the request of local
governments, the SDF recommends retired SDF personnel to share their experience and knowledge in this field.
As of March 31, 2008, the number of SDF personnel working at sections of local governments related to disaster
prevention is 139 people in 44 prefectures and 77 municipalities across the country. In addition, current SDF
personnel temporarily serve as staff in the Disaster Prevention Bureau of the Tokyo Metropolitan Government.
Additionally, in April 2008 a mutual exchange of administrative officials was conducted from the Central GSDF
Headquarters to Hyogo Prefecture’s Disaster Prevention Planning Office, and from Hyogo Prefecture to the
Central GSDF Headquarters Regional Communication Coordination Division. (See Reference 32)

While collaboration with the SDF at the time of a disaster is described in regional disaster prevention plans

prepared by prefectural governments, the following actions to be taken by local governments are important for
the Ministry of Defense and SDF to conduct disaster relief activities more effectively.

**a. Securing Assembly Areas[54] and Heliports[55]**

Disaster relief operations units require an assembly area at the site as a base for activities to secure a command
post, lodging, parking and to accumulate necessary materials. Furthermore, due to the fact that activities using
vehicles may be restricted at the time of a disaster, it is necessary to establish heliports at and nearby the disaster
site to enable transportation of emergency patients, transportation of materials and firefighting using helicopters.
At this time, in order to ensure smooth take-off and arrival of helicopters, it is necessary to clearly designate
evacuation centers and heliports as well as making these locations commonly known to the public in peacetime.
In addition, as a project to subsidize welfare facilities[56], parks have been improved in case they are deemed
necessary to facilitate evacuation and firefighting activities. For example, in the Regional Plan for Disaster
Prevention for Joetsu City in Niigata Prefecture, parks which are scheduled to be improved are planned to be
used as emergency heliports and assembly points for disaster relief units at the time of a disaster.

**b. Marking Building Numbers**
In order for aircraft to efficiently gather information and transport people and materials, it is useful to mark
numbers on the rooftops of facilities to identify buildings important for disaster prevention, such as prefectural


-----

offices and schools, so that buildings can be easily confirmed from the air, enabling faster disaster relief operations
by aircraft.

**c. Securing Facilities for Coordination and Communication**
It is also essential for facilities to be established within prefectures for liaison and coordination with the
SDF[57]. Further, it is important to develop a disaster prevention map for common use by all disaster prevention
organizations which indicate the location of evacuation areas and heliports, etc. Furthermore, it is necessary to
make coordination on a daily basis to secure water sources such as reservoirs, while maintaining firefighting
equipment for aerial firefighting by helicopter.

**(2) Development of a Response Manual for Various Disasters**
In order to respond more promptly and appropriately to disasters which occur in various forms, it is valid to clarify
basic responses in advance and consolidate the recognition of parties concerned. For this purpose, in November
2000, the (then) Defense Agency and SDF developed a response manual[58] for various types of disasters which
compiled issues to be noted for each type of disaster. Copies of this manual were distributed to relevant organizations
and local public bodies.

On July 16, 2007, the advance platoon rushed to a site in Kashiwazaki
city, Niigata Prefecture, to assist in the rescue of an 84-year-old
woman who had been trapped in a collapsed house in the area. When
we arrived, we saw a completely demolished warehouse: three-stories,
with a tiled roof, built right next to a family house. We cut a hole with a
chain saw designed to be used as lifesaving equipment and other tools
to clear a path out of the rubble. However, there was no response to
our calls and 30 minutes had passed since the operation started. When
our hopes of finding any signs of life began to fade, we heard someone
yell, “A voice!” The atmosphere of the site completely changed and
we confirmed the exact position. Rescuers reached the trapped woman
and shouted words of encouragement: “You can do it!” They gave her
an oxygen mask and used a hydraulic lifter to remove a slab lying on
her chest. At 15:30, we managed to rescue her safely. What was even
more touching was the sight of her family, weeping with relief and
happiness, as she was carried away on a stretcher. I fully realized the
importance of human lives.

**(3) Response to Nuclear Disasters**
The Special Law on Nuclear Disaster Countermeasures was enacted based on lessons learned from the critical
accident which occurred at the uranium processing plant in Tokaimura, Ibaraki Prefecture in 1999. In accordance
with this, the Self-Defense Forces Law was partially revised[59].

Following the critical nuclear accident at Tokaimura, the ASDF, GSDF and MSDF have provided transport

support, assistance for evacuating residents and monitoring of airborne and seaborne radiation levels in
comprehensive nuclear disaster prevention exercises conducted primarily by the Ministry of Economy, Trade and
Industry since 2000. This serves to improve effectiveness including a review of cooperation guidelines between
government agencies and local bodies at the time of a nuclear disaster.

Further, the Mid-Term Defense Program states that in addition to nuclear disasters, capabilities for responding

to NBC will be strengthened in order to deal with other special disasters[60].

Kanazawa Port for public tours of the vessel as
part of public relations activities. We immediately
set out for Kashiwazaki, the affected area, together
with our consort vessels. Immediately after our
arrival in the early morning of July 17, we began

service. All our crew members worked as one, with
ingenuity to conduct the disaster relief activities,
such as constructing temporary bathing facilities with

made efforts to ensure a more sanitary environment for devastated Kashiwazaki residents and to reduce their
mental stress. I had hardship, but got energy from the delighted faces of the residents which at the same time
made us feel pride and a sense of mission. I truly believe that the delight of the citizens was the very source
of energy for all team members.

**Major Naoki Nishimura**

**Air Rescue Wing Flight Group Niigata Rescue Team, ASDF**

On July 16, 2007, a holiday of Marine Day, I was
relaxing at home, when strong tremors shook the
ground. I knew immediately that the quake was large.
As a TV bulletin reported that a quake measuring
6-plus had hit my local area of Niigata, I rushed to
my base.

There I received an order to gather information

such as the extent of damage from the sky. I operated a
search and rescue helicopter (UH-60J) to the affected
area from Niigata Airport. Near Kashiwazaki City,
I confirmed areas with serious damage, roads and Major Nishimura in the cockpit of UH-60J
railways blocked by mudslides, and collapsed houses.
In addition to rescue activities for the affected people, the Niigata Rescue Team also maintained its readiness
for the potential for a massive aftershock.

When the Governor of Niigata visited the affected sites, I was ordered to provide air transportation for

him, since no conventional means of transport were available due to bad weather. I managed to complete
the airlift mission amidst heavy rain, and thick low-hanging clouds, which hampered a route over land and
forced us to fly along the coast in order to stay clear of the rain clouds.

Natural disasters are virtually impossible to predict. Therefore, it is crucial for rescue teams to maintain

readiness and mobility to swiftly respond to any given situation. I was convinced that these factors are key
to minimize the damage and provide prompt assistance to the affected people.

Through my experiences in the aftermath of the quake, I was able to renew my recognition of the noble

mission to “protect our people” and was filled with a sense of fulfillment on account of the significant
responsibilities associated with the mission. Going forward, I am determined to continue to develop myself
on a daily basis.

**6. Response to Other Events**

**1. Improvement in Guard Postures for SDF Facilities**
While police agencies have primary responsibility in dealing with incidents of terrorism, the Self-Defense Forces
Law was amended to allow SDF units to be called upon to guard facilities and areas of the SDF and USFJ, and
to use weapons as necessary in regular guarding assignments of SDF facilities in order to ensure readiness for
large-scale terrorist attacks such as those which occurred on September 11, 2001.

**(1) Operations for Guarding SDF Facilities (Guarding Operations)**
When there is a danger of a large-scale terrorist
attack on facilities and areas of the SDF and USFJ
within Japan and in the event it is deemed particularly
necessary to prevent damage, the Prime Minister may
order SDF units to conduct operations to guard facilities
and areas. Part of the authority given to police officials
under the Law Concerning the Execution of Duties of
Police Officials are applied correspondingly to SDF
personnel dispatched for guarding operations[61]. Further,
the amended Self-Defense Forces Law provides that
SDF personnel have authority to use weapons beyond
the limitations of Article 7 of this law. (See Fig.

GSDF personnel conducting guarding operation training at USFJ facilities

III-1-2-16)

The Ministry of Defense and SDF exchange opinions concerning guarding operations with the police and

Japan Coast Guard in order to ensure the effectiveness of such operations which are new duties for the SDF. In
addition, exercises for guarding operations have been conducted at USFJ facilities and areas throughout Japan
since 2003.

**(2) Use of Weapons to Guard SDF Facilities in Normal Circumstances**
The authority for use of weapons in the course of guarding SDF faclities[62] within Japan has been stipulated[63].

**Fig. III-1-2-16 Outline of Guarding Operations**

Situation

In cases where
special measures are
approved for
preventing damage
due to danger of
destructive actions
being carried out at
the facilities of SDF
and U.S. Forces in
Japan

Requirements for actions

1) Authorized to order
Prime Minister

2) Procedure
The Prime Minister determines the
facilities to be guarded as well as the
duration after listening to the opinions of
prefectural governors and having the
Minister of Defense confer with the
National Public Safety Commission

3) Withdrawal
The Prime Minister must order the
withdrawal of units without delay when it
has been confirmed that operations of the
units are no longer necessary, even when
it is still within the designated period

Primary Powers

1) Powers granted under the Law Concerning the

Execution of Duties of Police Officials, mutatis
mutandis, in questioning, *evacuation, *ingress,
*the prevention and control of crimes, and the
use of weapons

2) In addition to the above-mentioned use of weapons,

the use of weapons is permitted in the event a facility
being guarded in line with the SDF’s duty suffering
large-scale destruction or the danger of infringement
where there exists no other appropriate means to
overcome it except with the use of weapons, within
the scope of necessity reasonably judged from the
situation. Consequently, even when a person is
injured, even when it results in harm to people, the
actions would be legally regarded as a lawful act


-  Limited to cases where no police officers are present

**2. Maintaining Posture to Transport Japanese Nationals Overseas**

**(1) Amendment of Self-Defense Forces Law**
In addition to the currently utilized government aircraft and ASDF transport aircraft, in 1999, SDF ships and the
helicopters onboard were added as a means of transport for transporting Japanese nationals overseas in the event
of disasters, riots or other states of emergency in foreign countries. Further, SDF personnel became authorized to
use the minimum necessary weapons in order to protect the lives and bodies of themselves and Japanese nationals
and thus transportation conditions were reinforced. Furthermore, the transportation of Japanese nationals overseas
became a primary SDF mission in January 2007 with stipulation in Article 84-3 of the Self-Defense Forces Law.
(See Part II, Chapter 1, Section 4)

**(2) Postures of the ASDF, GSDF and MSDF**
In order to transfer Japanese nationals overseas from diplomatic establishments and transport them safely to
local airports and harbors, the GSDF designates dispatch personnel for helicopter guidance units[64], the MSDF
designates transport ships and air units, and the ASDF designates airlift units and personnel for the dispatch, in
order to maintain posture for readiness.

Furthermore, missions to transport Japanese nationals overseas are conducted in close cooperation between

the ASDF, GSDF and MSDF therefore integrated coordination is required. To meet this need, capability has been
improved to fulfill such missions through joint exercises using transport aircraft and ships.

**(3) Achievements in Transporting Japanese Nationals Overseas**
On April 15, 2004, 10 Japanese journalists on
assignment in Samawah, Iraq, to report on activities
of the GSDF dispatched under the Law Concerning
Special Measures on Humanitarian and Reconstruction
Assistance in Iraq were transported from Talil Airport
in Iraq to Mubarak Air Force Base in Kuwait by ASDF
transport aircraft (C-130H). This was the first transport
of Japanese nationals overseas based on Article 84-3
(then Article 100-8) of the Self-Defense Forces Law.

**3. Response to Situations in Areas Surrounding Japan**
In the event of situations in areas surrounding Japan, the Ministry of Defense and SDF will provide materials
and services as rear area support and conduct rear area search and rescue activities or ship inspection activities
as stipulated in the Law to Ensure Security for Situations in Areas Surrounding Japan and the Ship Inspections
Operations Law.

Furthermore, rear area support was entrenched as a primary mission of the SDF as stipulated in Article 84-4

of the Self-Defense Forces Law in January 2007. (See Part II, Chapter 1, Section 4)

**4. Military Intelligence Gathering**
In order for effective operation of defense capabilities to initially deal with new threats and diverse situations,
it is further required to detect signs of various situations in advance and gather, analyze and share information
promptly and appropriately with the objective of responding sufficiently to such situations. From the perspective


-----

of Japanese national security, broader scope and comprehensive intelligence capability are essential.

For this reason, the Ministry of Defense and the SDF comprehensively analyze and assess a variety of

information and have diversified the means of gathering intelligence. Specific intelligence gathering activities
include: 1) collecting, processing and analyzing radio waves in relation to military communications and radio
waves emitted from electronic weapons bound for Japan from overseas; 2) collecting and analyzing highresolution commercial satellite imagery data; 3) warning and surveillance of ships and aircraft; 4) collecting
and organizing a variety of published information; 5) information exchanges with defense authorities of other
nations; and 6) intelligence activities[65] such as those conducted by defense attachés and other officials[66].

In order to enhance the capability of gathering a variety of intelligence and comprehensively analyzing

and assessing information based on the security environment and technical trends, the Ministry of Defense
and the SDF will improve human resource cultivation, equipment, and devices for intelligence gathering as
well as enhance the organization of intelligence units which support such capability, starting with the Defense
Intelligence Headquarters.

Further, the Principles for Strengthening Intelligence Functions (of the Prime Minister’s Office) was adopted

at an Intelligence Capability Enhancement Review Committee of the Prime Minister’s Office in February 2008.
In order to strengthen the Prime Minister’s Office control tower function in relation to national security, given
the recognition of the extreme importance of strengthening intelligence functions in the Prime Minister’s Office,
the Ministry of Defense will cooperate to implement these policy measures such as linking with indicated policy
areas, intelligence gathering, summary and analysis, and information conservation. Moreover, it will continue to
provide timely and relevant information to the Prime Minister’s Office which is essential for national security.

Section 3. Preparation against Full-Scale Aggression

In the region surrounding Japan, even today, unpredictable and uncertain factors remain. Considering the
devastating loss of lives and property of the people that armed aggression could cause, readiness for full-scale
invasions is essential.

In the event of full-scale aggression against Japan, the GSDF, MSDF and ASDF will respond promptly and

effectively by means of a joint operational structure to act in a coordinated and integrated manner. Operations to
be employed in response to full-scale aggression are classified as follows according to function: 1) operations for
air defense, 2) operations for guarding the waters surrounding Japan, 3) operations for guarding the territories
of Japan, and 4) operations for securing the safety of maritime traffic. In implementing these operations, U.S.
forces will support operations employed by the SDF and conduct operations to supplement the capabilities of the
SDF, including operations which employ strike capabilities in accordance with the “Guidelines for U.S.-Japan
Defense Cooperation.”

This section explains the outline of typical operations which may be conducted by the SDF to defend the

nation in the event that full-scale aggression occurs. (See Chapter 2, Section 3)

**1. Air Defense Operations**
In the event of an armed attack on Japan, such attacks
are likely to begin with surprise air attacks using aircraft
and missiles, which may be repeated because of Japan’s
geographical characteristics of being surrounded by
waters and because of modern warfare trends[67].

Air defense operations are characterized by the

invading party having the advantage in choosing the
time, location and mode of attack and by adequacy of
the initial response having a significant effect on the
overall operation. Therefore, it is necessary to maintain
a prompt response posture in peacetime, continuously ASDF F-15 fighter in-flight
collect relevant information, and exhibit combat
strength promptly and comprehensively from the initial stage of operations.

Operations for air defense can be divided into overall operations led by the ASDF, and local air defense

operations conducted by the GSDF, MSDF and ASDF to defend their respective bases and units.

In terms of overall air defense, efforts will be made promptly in response to enemy air strikes to intercept

enemy aircraft as far from Japanese territory as possible to prevent the enemy from acquiring air superiority[68],
to prevent damage to the Japanese people and territory, to inflict heavy damage on the enemy and to deter serial
air assaults. (See Fig. III-1-3-1)

**(1) Detecting Intruding Enemy Aircraft**
The entire airspace surrounding Japan is under constant surveillance by means of air warning and control unit
radar and early warning and control aircraft so as to detect intruding enemy aircraft as early as possible.

**(2) Identifying the Detected Aircraft**
Detected aircraft are identified as enemy or friend according to the Base Air Defense Ground Environment
(BADGE)[69] system.

**(3) Interception and Destruction of the Enemy’s Aircraft**
In the event an aircraft is judged to be an enemy aircraft, the air warning and control unit organization assigns
destruction targets to aircraft standing-by on the ground or in the air, as well as to surface-to-air guided missile
units of the GSDF or ASDF. The enemy aircraft is then destroyed by guided and controlled fighter aircraft or
surface-to-air guided missiles.


-----

**2. Operations for the Defense of Surrounding Sea Areas**
Armed attacks on Japan can be made by vessels as well as by aircraft due to the island geography of Japan.

Operations for defending sea areas surrounding Japan will be led by the MSDF in cooperation with the

GSDF and the ASDF to execute various combined strategies including anti-surface ships, anti-submarines and air
defense warfare (local) operations. The cumulative result of these operations provides protection to surrounding
sea areas by obstructing enemy advances and exhausting the enemy’s military strength. (See Fig. III-1-3-2)

**(1) Defense on the Sea**
The MSDF patrols[70] vast sea areas using patrol aircraft and patrols navigation sea areas with destroyers. In the
event that an enemy surface ship or submarine attempting to attack Japanese ships is detected, it will be destroyed
by using MSDF destroyers, submarines and patrol aircraft (anti-surface ship and anti-submarine operations).
Additional support will be provided by fighters and others as the situation requires.

**(2) Defense in Coastal Areas**
The MSDF patrols the vicinity of major ports and harbors using destroyers, patrol aircraft and minesweepers for
the early detection of enemy offensives and to ensure the safety of ships and coastal areas.

In the event of an attack by enemy surface ships and submarines, these will be destroyed by using MSDF

destroyers, submarines and patrol aircraft (anti-surface ship and anti-submarine operations). In this case,
depending on the situation, support will be provided by fighter aircraft and GSDF surface-to-ship guided missile
units. Further, the MSDF will remove mines laid by the enemy using minesweepers (anti-mine operations).


-----

**(3) Defense in Main Straits**
As the situation requires, mines will be laid in main sea
areas using minesweeping mother ships, submarines,
and aircraft of the MSDF and ASDF (mine-laying
operations). In the event that enemy surface ships or
submarines attempt to pass the sea areas, they will be
destroyed by using MSDF destroyers, submarines and
patrol aircraft (anti-surface ship and anti-submarine
operations).

**(4) Air Defense in Surrounding Waters**
Air defense for ships in surrounding waters will be
performed by destroyers and will receive support from
fighters as necessary.

**Commander Hayato Shinzato**

**(Deputy Counsellor), Secretariat, Headquarters for Ocean Policy**

In April 2007, the Basic Law of the Sea was enacted,
and following its entry into force on July 20, 2007, the
Headquarters for Ocean Policy was newly organized
within the Cabinet Secretariat, which began work on
the formulation of the Basic Plan on Ocean Policy,
which is the first ever basic plan on policy relating
to the ocean created in Japan. The Headquarters for
Ocean Policy comprises 38 persons (including part-
time members), from eight ministries and agencies,
including two personnel dispatched from the
Ministry of Defense, one regular SDF member and Commander Shinzato and colleagues from other government agencies

(second from left)

an administrative official. Together, the group worked
towards the realization of Japan as a maritime nation.

The Basic Plan on Ocean Policy has been formulated with the aim of comprehensively promoting

measures concerning the ocean that will achieve balance and synergy among the concepts of “knowing the
ocean,” “protecting the ocean,” and “using the ocean.” The plan sets forth six basic policies and 12 measures
that the government should construct in a comprehensive and systematic manner and it was approved by
the Cabinet on March 18, 2008. The six basic policies are: (1) harmonization of the development and use
of the oceans with conservation of the marine environment; (2) ensuring safety and security of the oceans;
(3) improvement of scientific knowledge of the oceans; (4) sound development of ocean industries; (5)
comprehensive governance of the oceans; and (6) international partnership with regard to the oceans.

In the compilation of the plan, for example with regard to “ensuring safety and security of the oceans,”

based on a number of themes, such as how to approach safety and security issues in waters surrounding Japan


-----

and in sea lanes, the Secretariat used the opinions of experts, various organizations, and ordinary citizens
as reference and engaged in coordination and consultation with each ministry and agency. However, given
the differing views on ocean policy among government bodies the compilation process took approximately
eight months. Policy on oceans covers a wide range of areas, including development of resources, etc.,
environmental conservation and leisure, and one area among these is the fact that the ocean is the way by
which critical resources are transported to Japan. Accordingly, in my work as a member of the Secretariat I
very often found that my various experiences to date working in the field as an MSDF pilot of a P-3C patrol
aircraft and a YS-11 transportation aircraft and my work in the Joint Staff and Maritime Staff Office proved
to be an extremely beneficial asset.

The intergovernmental work to create a structure for the promotion of measures based on the Basic Plan

has only just begun, and there are many challenges and issues that Japan must address. In advancing ocean
policy, the Ministry of Defense and SDF play an important role in ensuring the peace and safety of the seas
as stipulated in the Basic Law of the Sea, and in the future I will continue to work in cooperation with other
ministries and agencies, as I believe it is my duty to work to promote the Basic Plan.

**3. Operations for Defending Japan’s Territory (Response to Landing of Invading Forces)**
In the event of an attempt to occupy the island nation of Japan, the invading country will acquire air and sea
superiority on the invading fronts and then land ground troops, etc., on Japanese territory by ship or aircraft.

However, it will be difficult for invading ground troops to demonstrate a systematic fighting force during

movements by ship and aircraft, and before and after landing. Operations in response to land invasions must take
advantage of this weakness to destroy enemy forces as early as possible by countering them between the sea and
coastal areas, as well as at landing sites, etc. (See Fig. III-1-3-3)

**(1) Defense in the Nearshore Waters**
The ASDF, GSDF and MSDF will endeavor, as much as possible, to destroy enemy ships transporting ground
troops and such, whilst at sea using destroyers, submarines, patrol aircraft, fighters and surface-to-ship guided
missiles to force the enemy to abandon its intention of landing or to reduce its strength.

Further, the ASDF and GSDF will endeavor to destroy enemy aircraft transporting ground troops in the air

using fighters and surface-to-air guided missiles.

**(2) Defense in Coastal Areas**
The MSDF will use minesweeping mother ships to lay sea mines and the GSDF will use amphibious mine-laying
equipment to lay coastal mines to obstruct and counter the mobilization of landing enemy forces.

The GSDF will play the primary role in response to enemy forces planning a landing by concentrating the

use of tanks, anti-tanks and special artillery of the units[71], etc. deployed close to the coast. In the event that an
enemy lands, the enemy invasion will be obstructed and destroyed through mobile striking ability provided
predominantly by special artillery of the units, anti-tank guided missiles and tanks. The ASDF will support the
GSDF with fighters during these operations.

Enemy airborne assaults[72] and helicopter borne assaults[73] conducted at this time in coordination with the

landing of ground troops will be destroyed in the early stages mainly through special artillery of the units and
mobile striking ability.

Further, the GSDF will conduct air defense (local) including units using anti-aircraft firepower starting with

surface-to-air guided missiles.

**(3) Inland Defense**
In the event that the SDF is not able to destroy enemy ground troops immediately after their landing, an enemy
advance will be prevented by pre-deployed units in inland areas with the support of fighters (holding operations).
In the meantime, to the utmost extent, units will be assembled from other areas to launch counterattacks to
eliminate advancing enemy ground troops.

**(4) Countermeasures to be Implemented throughout the Stages of Operations**
Throughout each of these stages, efforts will be made
by the MSDF using destroyers, submarines, and patrol
aircraft, and by the ASDF using fighters to obstruct
ocean transport ships providing reinforcements to
enemy ground troops and to cut off maritime logistical
support lines.

Furthermore, throughout operations, to counter

the landing of invading forces, the GSDF, MSDF and
ASDF will carry out air defense, reconnaissance, and
transport of units and supplies, etc., required for the
execution of operations.

**4. Operations for Ensuring the Safety of Maritime Traffic**
Maritime traffic is the lifeline of Japan and operations to ensure maritime traffic safety are important not only to
sustain the country’s fighting ability and foundation for survival, but also for enabling the support of U.S. forces
to the SDF.

The MSDF ensures the safety of maritime traffic by patrolling, escorting ships and making defensive

preparations for straits and harbors through a combination of various operations including anti-surface ship and
anti-submarine operations, air defense (local) and minesweeping operations. These operations are conducted in
waters several hundred nautical miles around Japan and also generally around 1,000 nautical miles in the event
of establishing sea lanes[74].

Operations conducted in waters surrounding Japan will be almost the same as those for defending the waters

surrounding Japan as described previously.

In the event of operations following the establishment of sea lanes, the sea lane will be patrolled continuously

to quickly detect and respond to disturbances from enemy surface ships or submarines, etc. In addition, Japanese
ships will be escorted as necessary.

Air defense of Japanese ships traveling in maritime traffic routes will be conducted by destroyers. In this

case, depending on the circumstances, support will be provided by fighters within a feasible range.

**COMMENTARY**

**Basic Plan on Ocean Policy**

Japan enforced the Basic Law on Ocean Policy in July 2007, as an oceanic nation facing the need to address
maritime-related issues through cooperation of related ministries and agencies, against the backdrop of
various issues associated with the ocean, particularly waters surrounding Japan. The Basic Law is aimed at
the sound development of Japan’s economy and stable enhancement of the life of its people, as well as the
pursuit of contribution to the coexistence of the ocean and mankind.

Pursuant to the Basic Law, the Cabinet approved the Basic Plan on Ocean Policy on March 18, 2008, as

the foundation for ocean-related measures, in order to promote maritime measures accordingly and jointly.
The Basic Plan incorporated measures that are highly important to Japan’s security, such as the safety of the
seas and maintenance of maritime transportation.

The Ministry of Defense, on its part, actively engaged in activities for the maritime policy of the entire

Government, which is headed by the Headquarters for Ocean Policy. For example, it has established a
section for maritime policy in its Bureau of Defense Policy. The Ministry of Defense further plans to
strategically examine the maintenance of maritime order, preservation of safe sea transportation lines from
the Middle East via the Straits of Malacca and Singapore to the waters surrounding Japan, and measures for
non-proliferation of weapons of mass destruction.

47) An SDF patrol aircraft (P-3C) discovered an unidentified vessel in a surveillance operation and monitored

it with patrol vessels and aircraft. The vessel did not stop despite repeated orders by the Japan Coast Guard.
As a result, the JCG fired warning shots after alerting the vessel, however, the vessel continued to make


-----

its getaway and made an armed attack on the patrol ship which fired shots in self-defense. The vessel
subsequently exploded from possible self-destruction and sunk. Based on facts revealed in the investigation
process the vessel was identified as a North Korean spy ship. Further, in 2002 a patrol aircraft (P-3C)
discovered an unidentified vessel in waters approximately 400km north-northwest off the Noto Peninsula
(beyond the exclusive economic zone of Japan) in a surveillance operation. The vessel was tracked and

operations occur or a fire or disaster occurs in the vicinity of Ministry of Defense facilities.
53) The Prime Minister issues an earthquake alert with endorsement of the Cabinet in the event that an earthquake

has been predicted and when it is deemed necessary to urgently implement emergency earthquake disaster
prevention measures.
54) Parks and playgrounds close to the disaster site are suitable for assembly areas. For example, for lodging

and the activities of forces on the scale of one GSDF regiment, approximately 15,000m[2] is required (an area
approximately one-third the size of the Tokyo Dome) and a division requires in excess of approximately
140,000m[2] (an area approximately three times the size of the Tokyo Dome).
55) While heliport sizes differ according to the type of helicopter and the nature of activities, as a rough estimate,

each helicopter requires a circle area with a radius of 50 to 100m.
56) Subsidized projects based on Article 8 of the Law Relating to Improvement, etc. of the Living Environment

Section 1. The Japan-U.S. Security Arrangements

Based on the Japan-U.S. Security Treaty[1], the Japan-U.S. Security Arrangements constitute a central pillar of
Japan’s national defense. The Japan-U.S. Security Arrangements also serve as the foundation of the U.S.-Japan
Alliance, and are indispensable not only to maintaining the peace and security of Japan, but also the entire AsiaPacific region. In addition, the close cooperative relationship between Japan and the U.S. resulting from their
alliance is proving to be extremely significant for effective responses to the diverse security challenges occurring
throughout the world.

Furthermore, the Japan-U.S. alliance is playing an increasingly important role by advancing the shared

fundamental values in the international community such as respect for human rights, freedom, democracy, and
the rule of law. The significance of the Japan-U.S. alliance continues to grow, and Japan will resolutely strive to
maintain and strengthen the Japan-U.S. Security Arrangements. (See Fig. III-2-1-1)

This section explains the significance of the Japan-U.S. Security Arrangements for Japan’s security today.

**1. The Significance of the Japan-U.S. Security Arrangements**

**1. Maintenance of Japan’s Security**
In today’s international community, any country seeking to secure its peace and independence must construct a
watertight defense system capable of responding to every contingency, ranging from all types of armed attacks
– including by nuclear weapons – to military threats or intimidation. In today’s globalized international community,
it is impossible even for a superpower like the U.S. to guarantee its security by acting alone. Therefore, it
would be practically impossible for Japan to ensure its national security by solely independent efforts given its
population, land and economy. Moreover, such a strategy would not be politically appropriate and would not
necessarily contribute to the regional stability.

Consequently, Japan maintains an alliance with the world’s dominant military superpower, the U.S., with

whom it shares basic values such as respect for freedom, human rights and democracy, and the desire to maintain
peace and security. In addition, the U.S. has strong economic ties with Japan and is also widely accepted by
countries in the Asia-Pacific region. Further, the overwhelming military strength of the U.S. functions as an
effective deterrent against threats to Japan’s security. When combined with Japan’s own considerable defense
capabilities, it creates an absolute defense structure fully capable of maintaining the security of our nation.

Article 5 of the Japan-U.S. Security Treaty designates that Japan and the U.S. will take bilateral action in the

event of an armed attack against Japan. The U.S. obligation to defend Japan in the event of an armed attack means
that an attacker must be prepared to confront not only the military power of the SDF, but also the overwhelming
military strength of the U.S. This serves as an effective deterrence to potential attacks.

**2. Maintenance of Peace and Stability in the Region Surrounding Japan**
Article 6 of the Japan-U.S. Security Treaty provides for the use of facilities and regions by the U.S. forces within
Japan for the purpose of maintaining the security of Japan, and also for the maintenance of international peace
and security in the Far East. This provision is based on the recognition that the security of Japan is closely tied to
the peace and security of the Far East region to which Japan belongs.

The close bonds of cooperation based on the Japan-U.S. Security Arrangements, as seen in the presence of

U.S. forces in Japan, also constitutes the essential foundation for the maintenance of peace and security in the
region. These arrangements are complemented by the alliances[2] and friendly relations the U.S. has built with
other countries in the region, and continue to play an important role in preserving the peace and security of the
Far East region in the post-Cold War security environment.

**3. Improvement of International Security Environment**
The Japan-U.S. Security Arrangements are the
foundation for a comprehensive and friendly cooperative
relationship between the U.S. and Japan, not only in the
defense area but also in a wide range of areas, including
political, economic and social aspects. The friendly
relationship between Japan and the U.S., founded on
their security arrangements, also forms the basis for
Japan’s foreign policy. It contributes to Japan’s ability
to implement positive measures to maintain the peace
and security of the international community, including
promoting dialogue and cooperation on multinational Verifying the embarkation of the GSDF CH-47 transport helicopter to the U.S. Air
security and cooperating with the United Nations in all Force C-17 transport aircraft at Yokota Air Base (February 2008) [U.S.A.F]
areas of its operations.


-----

Since the 9/11 terrorist attacks on the United States, the international community has been increasingly

concerned about new kinds of threats and diverse contingencies, such as international terrorist attacks and the
proliferation of weapons of mass destruction. In this international environment, the strong bonds forged between
Japan and the U.S. are playing an important role in achieving effective cooperative measures that can improve
the security of the international community.

In particular, under the auspices of the Japan-U.S. Security Arrangements, the SDF and U.S. forces are

working together in peacetime in a variety of areas to improve the levels of coordination. This kind of close
coordination forms the foundation for every kind of international collaboration undertaken by the SDF and U.S.
forces, and is resulting in their heightened operational effectiveness.

Peace and prosperity of the international community is closely linked to the peace and prosperity of Japan.

Accordingly, by cooperating with the U.S., which possesses preeminent international operational capabilities,
Japan is able to advance its measures to improve the international security environment. This in turn is enhancing
the security and prosperity of Japan.

**2. Presence of U.S. Forces in Japan**

**1. Significance of Presence of U.S. Forces in Japan (USFJ)**
Based on the Japan-U.S. Security Treaty, the United Sates stations its armed forces in Japan. Article 5 of the
Japan-U.S. Security Treaty obliges the United States to defend Japan, while Article 6 grants the United States
the use of facilities and areas in Japan. Taken as a whole, the obligations of both countries form a balance. This
differs from the North Atlantic Treaty, which provides only for shared defense by the contracting states.

In accordance with Article 5 of the Security Treaty, the U.S. forces in Japan (USFJ) have stable access to

facilities and areas in Japan. This access plays a key role in enabling a swift bilateral response by the SDF and
U.S. forces in the event of an armed attack against Japan, and constitutes a crucial element of the Japan-U.S.
Security Arrangements.

In addition, as previously stated, an attacking force

will confront not only the SDF, but also the USFJ.
Therefore, USFJ function as an effective deterrent
against an armed attack. Moreover, the actions of
USFJ in the defense of Japan will be assisted by the
timely reinforcement of other U.S. forces. The USFJ
also functions as the foundation for the reinforcement
actions of U.S. forces.

These USFJ functions play a vital role in

maintaining the security of Japan. In addition, the U.S.
military presence in Japan constitutes the basis for the
actions of U.S. forces in the region, and is a vital factor The U.S. aircraft carrier Kitty Hawk leaving Yokosuka port to be replaced with the
in maintaining peace and security in the region. (See U.S. aircraft carrier George Washington (May 2008) [U.S. Navy]

**2. USFJ Facilities and Areas and Local Communities which Host such Facilities and Areas**
The cooperation and understanding of the people in the regions which host facilities and areas used by U.S.
forces is vital for the USFJ to function to its full capabilities. However, in the past several decades since the
conclusion of the Japan-U.S. Security Treaty, the social environments surrounding facilities and areas used by
the U.S. forces have undergone considerable changes, such as urbanization.

In this context, it is necessary to minimize to the utmost extent the impact the facilities and areas have on their

surrounding environments, so that these facilities and areas may fully function, and that the USFJ can be truly
accepted and supported by the Japanese people.

As Japan is a relatively narrow country with a small range of plain areas, it is inevitable that many of the

facilities and areas used by U.S. forces are found close to residential and commercial zones. Facilities and areas
used by U.S. forces have a considerable effect on the living environment and development in these regions, due
to such factors as the location of the bases or the take-off and landing of aircraft. It is essential that measures
appropriate to each region are taken to minimize these effects. (See Chapter 4, Section 2-3)


-----

**3. USFJ in Okinawa**
In comparison to the U.S. mainland and Hawaii, Okinawa is located much closer to countries in East Asia.
Consequently, U.S. forces stationed in Okinawa are able to respond rapidly to needs for urgent deployment
within the region. Further, Okinawa’s certain distance from the countries surrounding Japan serves as an
additional geographical advantage. It is primarily for these reasons that U.S. Marines and other U.S. forces
that will constitute the main response force in the event of an emergency situation in the region are stationed in
Okinawa.

The facilities and areas used by U.S. forces in Okinawa have been provided by Japan for use by U.S. forces

since May 1972, when the U.S. returned Okinawa to Japan in accordance with the Status of Forces Agreement
(SOFA). At present, many facilities and areas are located within Okinawa Prefecture, including airfields,
maneuver areas and logistics support facilities. As of January 2008, 74% of the land used by the USFJ for
facilities and areas (for their exclusive use) was located in Okinawa. As a result, special consideration must be
paid to minimize the burdens on Okinawa.

Section 2. Japan-U.S. Security Consultation on the Future of the Japan-U.S.

Alliance and other Matters

The maintenance of peace and security requires the appropriate development of its means depending on changes
in the security environment. To make effective the cooperative relationship between Japan and the United States
as Japan’s ally based on the Japan-U.S. Security Arrangements, the Governments and people of both countries
must make constant efforts in developing the alliance depending on changes in the security environment from
time to time.

In consideration of the items described in Fig. III-2-2-1, Japan and the United States have been engaged in

consultations on the future Japan-U.S. alliance, including force posture realignment, in recent years. As a result,
the two countries have reached various epoch-making agreements for further enhancing the future. Japan and the
U.S. are engaged in all types of efforts in close coordination based on the Japan-U.S. alliance, including the May
2006 agreement on force posture realignment.

This section explains details of consultations, including the outline and background of Japan-U.S. consultations

on the future Japan-U.S. alliance and the realignment of USFJ.

Security Consultation on the Future of the Japan-U.S. Alliance


-----

**1. Outline of Recent Japan-U.S. Consultations**

**1. Post-Cold War Developments Concerning the Japan-U.S. Security Arrangements**
During the Cold War era, the Japan-U.S. Security Arrangements contributed to the maintenance of security of
Japan as a member of the Free World and the maintenance of peace and security of the region surrounding Japan.
Since the end of the Cold War era, Japan and the United States have held various types of dialogues depending on
changes in the international security environment. The two countries announced the Japan-U.S. Joint Declaration
on Security, which clarifies the direction of bilateral cooperation for the 21st century, at the Japan-U.S. summit
meeting held in Tokyo in April 1996. (See Reference 33)

The Japan-U.S. Joint Declaration on Security reaffirmed that the bilateral security relationship would remain

the cornerstone for maintaining stability and prosperity in the region, and indicated those cooperative measures
in specific areas that would serve as important pillars to enhance the credibility of the Japan-U.S. alliance.

Based on the Declaration, in September 1997, the two countries established new Guidelines for Japan-U.S.

Defense Cooperation (hereafter referred to as the “Guidelines”), and implemented various measures. Through
these measures, Japan-U.S. defense cooperation has become more effective, and the credibility of the Japan-U.S.
Security Arrangements has further strengthened. (See Section 3-2, Reference 40)

**2. Activities since the September 11th Terrorist Attacks**

**(1) Background of Japan-U.S. Consultations**
Since the terrorist attacks on September 11, 2001 Japan and the U.S. have pursued new postures to deal with
the changing security environment including emerging threats such as international terrorist activities and the
proliferation of weapons of mass destruction, as shown in Figure III-2-2-1.

Based on the understanding that it is important for Japan and the United States to maintain close exchanges

in reviewing respective defense and security policies in the new security environment, the Japan-U.S. Security
Consultative Committee[3] (hereafter referred to as the “2+2 meeting”) held in December 2002 confirmed that the
bilateral security consultations should be intensified. Since then, working-level consultations have been held.

Those Japan-U.S. consultations have been conducted as part of bilateral strategic dialogues from a viewpoint

of how to make the capabilities of the Japan-U.S. alliance more effective in meeting changes of the times. Japan
has proactively addressed these consultations for the maintenance of its own security, based on the basic policy
to maintain deterrence and capabilities and to reduce burdens on local communities.

Japan’s basic policy reflects the perception that amid the changing security environment, in order to remain

strong, the Japan-U.S. alliance requires both the enhancement of reliability and effectiveness of U.S. commitment
to the defense of Japan and the maintenance of peace and security of the Asia-Pacific region and broad and firm
support of the people of the two countries.

Based on this basic policy, Japan-U.S. consultations have confirmed strategic objectives common to both

countries at first, examined Japan-U.S. roles, missions and capabilities in order to achieve common strategic
objectives, and then examined force posture realignment (realignment of USFJ) based on those roles, missions
and capabilities, and have established the direction of Japan-U.S. alliance gradually and comprehensively.

m Confirmation of Common Strategic Objectives (the First Stage)
The two countries identified the strategic objectives concerning defense and security that should be achieved by
them in the region and the world, and confirmed them in the joint statement at the 2+2 meeting held in February
2005. At this meeting, the two countries agreed that they should intensify consultations on the sharing of the
roles, missions and capabilities as examined at the second stage and on force posture realignment as studied at
the third stage. (See 2 of this section, Reference 34)


-----

m Examination of Roles, Missions and Capabilities of Japan and the United States (the

**Second Stage)**

The two countries examined the roles, missions and capabilities of the SDF and U.S. forces that would be needed
for achieving the strategic objectives identified at the first stage, taking into consideration the developments and
achievements of security and defense policies of the two countries in recent years.

This examination was made to clarify how Japan and the United States should cooperate with each other while

the SDF and U.S. forces coordinate adequately before the Unites States would begin force posture realignment.

Pursuant to these consultations, the two-plus-two meeting held in October 2005 prepared a joint document

titled the U.S.-Japan Alliance: Transformation and Realignment for the Future (hereafter referred to as the “SCC
document”). The SCC document indicates the concrete direction of the roles, missions and capabilities shared by
Japan and the United States, and other matters. (See 2 of this section, Reference 35)

m Force Posture Realignment (Realignment of USFJ) (the Third Stage)
The two countries studied the postures of USFJ and the related SDF that would be necessary for performing or
demonstrating such roles, missions and capabilities that were examined at the second stage.

The study on the realignment of USFJ was conducted based on the basic policy of maintaining deterrence and

capabilities and reducing burdens on local communities.

The SCC document issued in October 2005 indicated the guiding precepts (see Fig. III-2-2-2) and a specific

direction of the realignment of postures of USFJ and related units of the SDF for this study. At the two-plus-two
meeting held in May 2006, Japan and the United States finalized the realignment in a document titled the JapanU.S. Roadmap for Realignment Implementation (hereafter referred to as the “Roadmap”), which indicated the
details for implementing concrete initiatives. (See 2 of this section, Reference 36-37)

The overview of Japan-U.S. consultations is shown in Fig. III-2-2-3. A joint document was produced at the

two-plus-two meeting held at each stage. Thus, the transparency of consultations was ensured and their contents
were made known in Japan and abroad.

**(2) Japan-U.S. Alliance for the World and Asia**
At the Japan-U.S. Summit Meeting held in 2003, the two countries agreed to enhance the Japan-U.S. alliance
in the global context, by cooperating and strengthening the relationship with the international community in
addressing global problems, as part of efforts to deal with a new security environment. Then, at the JapanU.S. Summit Meeting held in November 2006, they confirmed that they would work on various challenges of

strengthening the Japan-U.S. relationship.

**3. Recent Developments**
The two countries confirmed the progress made to
date with the Roadmap initiatives at the two-plustwo meeting held in May 2007, and reaffirmed the
importance of steady implementation of the initiatives.

At the Japan-U.S. Summit Meeting held on

November 16, 2007 Prime Minister Fukuda and
President Bush agreed to steady implementation of
the Roadmap initiatives for the realignment of USFJ
to maintain deterrence and capabilities while reducing Prime Minister Fukuda at a summit with President Bush (October 2007) [Cabinet

the international community based on the policy of Japan-U.S. Alliance for the World and Asia, while further

burdens on local communities. They also confirmed their Public Relations Office]


-----

shared recognitions that the Japan-U.S. Alliance is the key to the development of Japan-U.S. diplomacy in Asia,
that the alliance plays an essential role in Japan and the U.S. dealing with global issues, and that it is important
to further strengthen deterrence and capabilities, which result from the Japan-U.S. Security Arrangements, the
basis for the Japan-U.S. Alliance.

**Fig. III-2-2-2 Summary of Guiding Precepts**

1) The U.S. military in the Asia-Pacific region is a core capability that is

indispensable to regional peace and security presence is critical for the peace
and stability of the Asia-Pacific region.

2) Capabilities will be strengthened through realignment as well as adjustment of

roles, missions and capabilities.

3) Coordination or interoperability between headquarters will be enhanced or

improved for the purpose of flexible and responsive command and control.

4) Regular training and exercises, as well as availability of facilities and areas for

these purposes, are essential. Dispersal of training can provide greater
diversity of training opportunities and can have the ancillary benefit of reducing
burdens on local communities.

5) Shared military use can promote effectiveness of bilateral cooperation.
6) Capacity of the U.S. facilities and areas can provide a critical capability toward

meeting local emergency needs such as in disaster relief situations.

7) Particular attention is paid to possible realignment of force structure in densely

populated areas.

8) The civilian-military dual use will be studied, where appropriate, so that it is

compatible with operational requirements.

**2. Roles, Missions and Capabilities of Japan and the United States (the Second Stage)**

**(1) Basic Concepts of Roles, Missions and Capabilities**
The basic concepts on such primary areas indicated in the SCC document as “defense of Japan and responses
to situations in areas surrounding Japan, including responses to new threats and diverse contingencies” and
“efforts to improve the international security environment” are shown in Figs. III-2-2-4 and III-2-2-5. In due
consideration of the increasing importance of these two areas, Japan and the United States will develop their
respective defense capabilities and maximize the benefits of innovations in technology.

**(2) Examples of Operations in Bilateral Security and Defense Cooperation to be Improved**
The SCC document reconfirmed the necessity to strengthen the entire spectrum of bilateral cooperation. The
document pointed out specific examples of key areas for further enhancement in the current security environment,
as described in Fig. III-2-2-6.

But the list of key areas is not intended to be an exhaustive list of possible areas of cooperation, and other

areas of operation not explicitly listed above remain important.

**(3) Indispensable Steps to Strengthen Posture for Bilateral Security and Defense Cooperation**
It is important for Japan and the United States to intensify their postures of security and defense cooperation so
that the two countries may respond to diverse contingencies in a new security environment. For this purpose, the
two countries must implement necessary steps in peacetime. Some examples of the essential steps specified in
the SCC document are listed in Fig. III-2-2-7.

|---|---|---|



Notes: 1. Close policy consultations on security are conducted between officials of the Governments of Japan and the United States through Security Consultative

Committee (SCC) of ministerial level (so-called “2 + 2” meeting), Japan-U.S. defense ministerial meeting the Subcommittee for Defense Cooperation (SDC) and
others. As for operations, there exist a comprehensive mechanism and a bilateral coordination mechanism under the Guidelines. (See Section 3 of this chapter)

2. The term “interoperability” refers to the commonness and duality of tactics, equipment, logistics support a bilateral the implementation guidelines for various

operations.

**(4) Enhancement and Expansion of Japan-U.S. Security and Defense Cooperation**
Japan and the U.S. agreed to enhance and improve the effectiveness of Japan-U.S. defense cooperation indicated in
the Guidelines and cooperation in other fields, if necessary, that are not specified in the Guidelines. (See Section 3-2)

Japan and the United States emphasized at the two-plus-two meeting held in May 2006 that the effectiveness of

bilateral security and defense cooperation should be strengthened or improved, and the two countries emphasized
the importance of examining security and defense cooperation so that the two countries may solidify the alliance
relationship and improve the alliance capabilities.

Furthermore, in the joint statement made at the two-plus-two meeting held in May 2007, the two countries

reviewed progress in updating roles, missions, and capabilities in line with the alliance transformation vision
indicated in the October 2005 SCC document, and highlighted as follows:
m The redefinition of the SDF’s primary mission to include international peacekeeping operations, international

disaster relief operations, and responses to situations in areas surrounding Japan;

m Sustained progress in developing more specific planning to reflect the evolving security environment and to

better posture the forces of the two countries to operate together in a regional crisis;

m Substantive agreement between the two governments concerning security measures for the protection

of classified military information, also known as a General Security of Military Information Agreement
(GSOMIA)[4];


-----

m Establishment of a bilateral Chemical, Biological, Radiological, and Nuclear (CBRN) Defense Working

Group;

m Establishment of a flexible, bilateral interagency coordination mechanism to coordinate policy, operational,

intelligence, and public affairs positions before and during crisis situations; and

m Execution of joint, bilateral training exercises to strengthen interoperability and advance alliance roles,

missions, and capabilities.

**3. Force Posture Realignment, Including USFJ (the Third Stage)**

**(1) Overview**
The force posture realignment of USFJ is necessary to maintain the stable presence of USFJ, which serves as
deterrence and capabilities in the Asia-Pacific region, to adapt the Japan-U.S. alliance based on the Japan-U.S.
Security Arrangements to a new security environment, and thereby to reinforce the peace of Japan and the peace
and security of the Asia-Pacific region.

The implementation of these realignment initiatives will lead to a new phase in alliance cooperation and

strengthened alliance capabilities in the region. The measures to be implemented demonstrate the resolve of both
parties to strengthen their commitments under the Japan-U.S. Security Treaty and, at the same time, to reduce
burdens on local communities, including those on Okinawa.

The construction and other costs for facility development in the implementation of these initiatives will be

borne by the Government of Japan unless otherwise specified in the Roadmap. The U.S. Government will bear
the operational costs that arise from the implementation of these initiatives. Since the realignment of USFJ is
an important task to reduce burdens on local communities, including Okinawa, while maintaining deterrence
and capabilities of USFJ, it is decided that proper budgetary measures will be taken after having examined the
particulars of costs to be borne by Japan.

The realignment is described in Fig. III-2-2-8 and Fig. III-2-2-9, and the current status of specific measures

is explained below.

**(2) Force Posture Realignment in Okinawa**
At present, many of USFJ facilities and areas are located in Okinawa.

In particular, U.S. Marine Corps in Okinawa with high mobility and readiness play multiple roles in defending

Japan, and in maintaining the peace and security of the region, including responses to the earthquake that took
place in Java, Indonesia in May 2006.

As part of its global military posture realignment effort, the U.S. is conducting some reviews to strengthen its

force structures in the Pacific. Among these reviews are strengthening Marine Corps crisis response capabilities
and redistributing those capabilities to provide greater flexibility to respond with appropriate capabilities
according to the nature and location of particular situations. These reviews will also enable increased security
cooperation with countries in the region, thereby improving the overall security environment.

In connection with this realignment, a set of integrated measures that will also substantially reduce burdens

on Okinawa are identified as follows.

**a. Futenma Replacement Facility and Other Matters**
The U.S. Marine Corps Air Station Futenma (MCAS Futenma) fulfills the following functions:
1) To transport ground units of Marine Corps by helicopters and other means;
2) To operate tanker aircraft;
3) To accommodate aircraft in case of emergency.

-  Items written in boldface show the implementation of actual measures.

In the meantime, local residents have strongly demanded the early return of MCAS Futenma for their concerns

over local safety, noise and traffic of the region as it is located in the middle of the residential area.

Therefore, the following initiatives will be implemented on the functions of MCAS Futenma, and then the

air station will be returned.

**(a) Function to Transport Ground Units of Marine Corps by Helicopters and Other Means**
**a Status of Basic Plan Based on the SACO Final Report**
In the Special Action Committee on Okinawa (SACO) Final Report prepared in December 1996, the two countries
agreed to totally return MCAS Futenma after an adequate replacement facility is completed within five to seven
years. (See 4 of this section)

A sequence of events related to the replacement facility for MCAS Futenma (hereafter referred to as the

“Futenma Replacement Facility (FRF)”) after the issuance of the Final Report are shown in Fig. III-2-2-10. In
2002, the Basic Plan of the FRF was finalized. After that, although an environmental impact assessment procedure
started in 2004, and the technical site survey, a necessary procedure for commencement of construction begun in
2003, the process did not go smoothly, and as the construction of the FRF was expected to take nine and a half
years, it is now expected that it will take another ten years or so to relocate and return MCAS Futenma.

In addition, a U.S. military helicopter accident took place in Ginowan City in August 2004. It became evident

that the existence of MCAS Futenma in the middle of the residential area has a potential risk, and therefore it was
strongly recognized that the early relocation and return of MCAS Futenma is essential.

In order to drive away a general feeling of unrest among local residents, the two Governments conducted

a study again on how to realize early relocation and return of MCAS Futenma during the course of Japan-U.S.
consultations on the realignment of USFJ.


-----

**b Basic Concept of Review of Futenma Relocation**
The U.S. Marine Corps in Okinawa consist of air, ground, logistics and command elements, and the interaction of
those elements in actual operations is necessary. Therefore, both sides conducted a study based on the recognition
that the FRF needs to be located within Okinawa Prefecture so that rotary wing aircraft currently stationed at
MCAS Futenma will be located near the other elements with which they train or operate on a regular basis.

In the study, both sides considered several factors, including safety of neighboring communities and military

personnel, noise impacts on local communities, impacts on the natural environment including seaweed beds, and
operational requirements in peacetime and in contingencies.

**c Overview of Futenma Relocation**
Based on the aforementioned concept, both sides conducted the study intensively. As a result, in the SCC document
prepared in October 2005, the initiative to “locate the FRF in an ‘L’-shaped configuration that combines the
shoreline areas of Camp Schwab and adjacent water areas of Oura Bay” was approved.

Thereafter, as a result of consultation with local municipalities, including Nago City, agreements on the FRF

were made with Nago City and Ginoza Village in April 2006 stating that, based on the initiative approved in the
SCC document, two runways would be constructed to avoid an air route above the surrounding area pursuant


-----

to the request from the local communities, and that the runways should be constructed by paying due attention to
the following points: 1) safety of lives of local residents; 2) conservation of the natural environment; and 3) the
feasibility of the project. Then, it was decided that the Ministry of Defense, Okinawa Prefecture, Nago City, Ginoza
Village and related local municipalities would continue to have consultations on the plan of construction of the FRF
in good faith on a continuous basis to reach a conclusion.

Based on the above-mentioned agreement, both countries agreed in the Roadmap, to locate the FRF in a

configuration that combines the Henoko-saki and adjacent water areas of Oura and Henoko Bays. This facility
includes two runways aligned in a “V”-shape, each runway having a length of 1,600meters plus two 100-meter
overruns. The length of each runway portion of the facility is 1,800meters, exclusive of seawalls.

The facility ensures agreed operational capabilities while addressing issues of safety, noise, and environmental

impacts.

As indicated in the SACO Final Report, the FRF will have capabilities to support operations of helicopters now

stationed in MCAS Futenma and short take-off and landing aircraft operations. There’s no plan to operate fighter
aircraft from this facility.

Furthermore, it is indicated that, in order to locate the FRF in the Camp Schwab area, necessary adjustments

will be made, such as reconfiguration of Camp Schwab facilities and adjacent water surface areas.

In principle, the construction method for the FRF will be landfill. The construction work is targeted for

completion by 2014. It is indicated that relocation to the FRF will occur when the facility is fully operationally
capable. (See Fig. III-2-2-11)

In the case of the newly agreed FRF, construction will be made mainly on land and therefore construction

work may be started earlier and conducted more steadily as compared with the old plan. Thus, earlier relocation
becomes possible. In addition, the portion to be constructed in the offshore area will be made as small as possible.
Thus, full consideration is given to environmental impacts. Concerning the construction of the FRF, the Governor
of Okinawa Prefecture and the then Minister of State for Defense signed, in May 2006, a Memorandum of Basic
Understanding in which both parties agreed to cope with the issue based on the Government plan and paying due
attention to: 1) removal of danger of MCAS Futenma; 2) safety of lives of local residents; 3) conservation of the
natural environment; and 4) feasibility of the project.

**d Status of Coordination with Local Communities**
The Government made a Cabinet decision on May 30, 2006 to proceed with the construction based on the plan
approved at the two-plus-two meeting held on May 1, 2006 and by taking into consideration the positions of the
Government, Okinawa Prefecture and the related local municipalities and background of the relocation of MCAS
Futenma, aimed to develop a construction plan immediately. It was also decided that the specific construction plan,
safety/environmental measures and local development measures should be addressed through consultations made
at a consultative organ, which is established jointly with Okinawa Prefecture and related local municipalities[5].

Since August 2006, the Council Meetings on Measures for Relocation of MCAS Futenma[6] have been held as

follows.

Council Meetings held to date:
m First Council Meeting (on August 29, 2006)
m Second Council Meeting (on December 25, 2006)
m Third Council Meeting (on January 19, 2007)
m Fourth Council Meeting (on November 7, 2007)
m Fifth Council Meeting (on December 12, 2007)
m Sixth Council Meeting (on February 7, 2008)
m Seventh Council Meeting (on April 9, 2008)

**e Status of Implementation of the Environmental Impact Assessment**
The Environmental Impact Assessment Scoping Document (hereafter referred to as the “Scoping Document”) was
sent to the Governor of Okinawa Prefecture and others on August 7, 2007. It was announced and presented to the
public and summaries of the opinions pertaining to the Scoping Document from residents and others were sent to
the Governor of Okinawa Prefecture and others on October 22, 2007. Then, the Governor of Okinawa Prefecture’s
opinion on the Scoping Document was submitted on December 21, 2007 and January 21, 2008. Based on that
opinion and other factors, additions and corrections to the Scoping Document were submitted to the Governor of
Okinawa Prefecture on February 5, 2008. On March 14, 2008, the revised edition of this was sent to the Governor of
Okinawa Prefecture and others, and a survey in accordance with the Scoping Document was begun on March 15.

**(b) Function to Operate Tanker Aircraft**
Air refueling aircraft KC-130 (12 in total) are to be relocated from Futenma Air Station to Marine Corps Air
Station (MCAS) Iwakuni under the Roadmap as well as the SACO Final Report. They will be regularly deployed
on a rotational basis to Kanoya Base and Guam for training and operations. Consultations are being held between
Japan and the U.S. pertaining to training and operations at Kanoya Base.

**(c) Base Function to Accommodate Aircraft in Contingencies**
Strengthened contingency use of Nyutabaru Air Base (in Miyazaki Prefecture) and Tsuiki Air Base (in Fukuoka
Prefecture) of ASDF will be provided for U.S. forces. When site surveys are completed, facility improvements
for the strengthened use will be made as necessary before MCAS Futenma is returned. These improved facilities,
when completed, will also support the bilateral training activities, which should be expanded according to the
recommendations on roles, missions and capabilities.

Because operations using long runways cannot be replicated at the FRF, improved contingency use of civilian

facilities will be examined in the context of bilateral contingency planning, and appropriate arrangements will be
made in order to realize the return of MCAS Futenma.


-----

**(d) Efforts to Eliminate Danger at MCAS Futenma**
On August 10, 2007 the Ministry of Defense announced various measures as part of efforts to eliminate
dangers at MCAS Futenma: 1) improving approach and takeoff routes including actively avoiding areas of high
residential density, 2) expanding clear zones and other measures for safe return from the area around the airfield
when there is engine trouble, 3) improving equipment to make the runways more easily visible at night, and 4)
developing automatic flight control systems rather than relying on eyesight. The Ministry of Defense is steadily
implementing these measures.

The Japan-U.S. Joint Committee agreed on February 19, 2008 that of these measures the Government of

Japan would improve facilities to make runways more easily visible at night and to expand clear zones.

**b. Force Reductions and Relocation to Guam**
In conjunction with the realignment of U.S. Marine Corps capabilities in the Asia-Pacific region, the personnel of
the III Marine Expeditionary Force (III MEF) will be relocated to Guam and the remaining Marine units in Okinawa
will be realigned. Due to this realignment in Okinawa, it is planned that approximately 8,000 III MEF personnel and
their approximately 9,000 dependents will relocate from Okinawa to Guam by 2014 in a manner that maintains unit
integrity[7]. U.S. Marine Corps forces remaining in Okinawa will consist of Marine Air Ground Task Force elements,
such as command, ground, aviation, and combat service support, as well as a base support capability.

As for costs of relocating U.S. forces to Guam, the Governments of both Japan and the United States held

consultations on how both sides should share such costs. At the Japan-U.S. defense summit meeting held in
April 2006, both sides agreed on the sharing of costs for providing facilities and infrastructure involved in the
relocation of U.S. forces to Guam, as described in Fig. III-2-2-14. (See 3 of this section)

**c. Land Returns and Shared Use of Facilities**
**(a) Return of Significant Land Areas South of Kadena Air Base**
The facilities and areas of USFJ are located in densely populated areas south of Kadena Air Base (approximately
1,500ha in total). Following the relocation and return of MCAS Futenma, and the transfer of III MEF personnel
to Guam described before, the remaining facilities and areas in Okinawa will be consolidated, thereby enabling
the return of significant land areas south of Kadena Air Base.

In the Roadmap prepared in May 2006, Japan and the United States agreed to develop a detailed consolidation

plan for the six candidate facilities (Camp Kuwae, Camp Zukeran, MCAS Futenma, Makiminato Service Area,
Naha Port, and Army POL Depot Kuwae Tank Farm No.1). At present, the plan is under deliberation between
both countries. (See Fig. III-2-2-8)

**(b) Steady Implementation of the SACO Final Report**
The steady implementation of the SACO Final Report prepared in 1996 is important because it aims to properly
maintain the capabilities and readiness of USFJ and to reduce impacts of operations of U.S. forces on local
residents of Okinawa. In the Roadmap, Japan and the United States agreed to the possibility that the SACO
relocation and return initiatives may need to be re-evaluated.

**(c) Shared Use of USFJ Facilities and Areas in Okinawa**
The SDF has only a limited number of facilities in Okinawa, including Naha Air Base, and most of them are
located in urbanized areas with some operational restriction. Therefore, the shared use of USFJ facilities and
areas in Okinawa will greatly improve the training environment for SDF units in Okinawa, and facilitate bilateral
training and interoperability between the SDF and U.S. forces. Some of the shared use will improve readiness
and contribute to maintaining the safety of local residents at a time of disaster.


-----

Based on such concepts, it was decided that Camp Hansen would be used for GSDF training, and training

commenced in March 2008. ASDF will use Kadena Air Base for bilateral training with U.S. forces while taking
into account noise impacts on local communities.

**d. Relationships among Realignment Initiatives**
Within the overall realignment package in the Roadmap, the Okinawa-related realignment initiatives are
interconnected. Specifically, consolidation and land returns south of Kadena Air Base depend on completing
the relocation of III MEF personnel and dependents from Okinawa to Guam. The III MEF relocation from
Okinawa to Guam is dependent on: 1) tangible progress toward completion of the FRF; and 2) Japan’s financial
contribution to fund development of required facilities and infrastructure on Guam.

**(3) Improvement of U.S. Army Japan Command and Control Capacity**
The headquarters of U.S. Army Japan (USARJ) at Camp Zama (in Kanagawa Prefecture) was activated as the
headquarters of the I Corps (Forward)/USARJ on December 19, 2007[8]. This transformation is based on the global
realignment of USARJ as part of the overall transformation of U.S. forces. The transformed USARJ headquarters
in Japan will continue to hold the same core mission of defending Japan and maintaining the peace and security
of the Far East.

To enable rapid responses to various contingencies, the GSDF Central Readiness Force Headquarters that

centrally controls mobile operation units and specialized units will relocate to Camp Zama by Japan Fiscal Year
2012 so that it may strengthen coordination with the transformed USARJ headquarters.

Along with the transformation of USARJ headquarters, a battle command training center and other support

facilities will be constructed within U.S. Forces Sagami General Depot (SGD) (in Kanagawa Prefecture) using
U.S. funding. In addition, measures will be implemented for more efficient and effective use of Camp Zama and
SGD, including partial releases of facilities and areas.

**(4) Yokota Air Base and Airspace**
**a. Establishment of the Bilateral Joint Operations Coordination Center (BJOCC)[9]**
Enhancement of coordination between headquarters, combined with the transition to a joint operations structure,
is quite important from the perspective of ensuring flexible and rapid responses of the SDF and U.S. forces. The
headquarters of USFJ located at Yokota Air Base (in Tokyo) plays an important role in the various mechanisms[10]
under the Guidelines. Therefore, along with the relocation of ASDF Air Defense Command as mentioned below,
the Bilateral Joint Operations Coordination Center (BJOCC) is to be established and it is planned to complete
construction/installation of facilities and infrastructure
and to commence operations at the BJOCC by Japan
Fiscal Year 2010.


**b. Relocation of ASDF Air Defense Command**
ASDF Air Defense Command located in Fuchu City,
Tokyo has an air defense mission, and will function
as a headquarters for BMD operations in the future. In
the case of air defense and BMD, response time is very
short. Therefore, it is quite important for the SDF and
U.S. forces to immediately share necessary information.
Thus, in Japan Fiscal Year 2010, ASDF Air Defense
Command and its relevant units will relocate to Yokota


ASDF controllers together with U.S. Air Force controllers at the Yokota RAPCON
facility


-----

Air Base where the headquarters of U.S. 5th Air Force is located[11]. This arrangement and the establishment of the
above-mentioned BJOCC will enhance coordination between headquarters of the SDF and U.S. forces, including
the sharing of information concerning air defense and BMD.

**c. Yokota Airspace**
At Yokota Air Base, U.S. forces conduct radar approach control for the Yokota airspace spreading from the
western part of the Tokyo Metropolitan area to Niigata Prefecture. To facilitate the operation of those civilian
airplanes that have been forced to deviate from the airspace, however, the following measures are pursued.
(a) Establish a program in Japan Fiscal Year 2006 to inform commercial aviation entities of the existing procedure

needed for transiting Yokota airspace.
(b) Develop a procedure in Japan Fiscal Year 2006 for temporary transfer of air traffic control responsibility to

Japanese authorities for portions of Yokota airspace, when not required by military purposes.
(c) Return portions of Yokota airspace to Japanese authorities by September 2008 after having identified the

returned portions by October 2006.
(d) Complete a study[12] of the conditions required for the possible return of the entire Yokota airspace by Japan

Fiscal Year 2009.

In response, the procedure mentioned in (b) as above started in September 2006. The themes of 1)

identification of the airspace portions to be returned by September 2008 and 2) collocation of U.S. forces and
SDF controllers at the Yokota Radar Approach Control (Yokota RAPCON) facility have been examined by the
Civil Aeronautics Subcommittee established under the Japan-U.S. Joint Committee, approved by the Japan-U.S.
Joint Committee, and mutually agreed by the Governments of both countries, in October 2006. Once the airspace
portions mentioned in above item 1) are returned to Japan, the airspace portion of the Yokota airspace adjoining
the western part of Haneda International Airport will be reduced by approximately 40%. Further in connection
with item 2), Japanese ASDF traffic controllers have been collocated at Yokota Air Base since May 2007.

The lessons learned from experiences with the collocation will be taken into account in the study of the

conditions required for the possible return of the entire Yokota airspace. (See Fig. III-2-2-12)

**d. Civilian-Military Dual Use of Yokota Air Base**
At the Japan-U.S. Summit Meeting held in May 2003, it was agreed that the feasibility of a civilian-military
dual use of Yokota Air Base would be bilaterally studied by both governments. A Liaison Conference was then
established as a working panel attended by ministries and agencies (the Cabinet Secretariat, the Ministry of
Foreign Affairs, the Ministry of Land, Infrastructure and Transport, the Defense Agency (now reorganized in the
Ministry of Defense)), the Defense Facilities Administration Agency (at the time)) and the Tokyo Metropolitan
Government. Since then, discussions have been made.

The Governments of Japan and the United States have conducted a study, starting in October 2006, of the

specific conditions and modalities in the study group, with the understanding that the dual use will not compromise
military operations and safety[13] of Yokota Air Base, and based on further coordination and the outcome of the
study, both governments will consult and then make appropriate decisions.

**(5) Relocation of Carrier Air Wing from Atsugi Air Facility to MCAS Iwakuni**
**a. Significance of Deployment of U.S. Aircraft Carriers**
The presence of the U.S. Pacific Fleet plays an important role in maintaining the regional peace and stability,
including the safety of its maritime traffic in the Asia-Pacific region. U.S. aircraft carriers are the core capability
in the Fleet. To date, the U.S. aircraft carrier, Kitty Hawk, has been deployed to this region and has been visiting
Yokosuka (in Kanagawa Prefecture). A homeport for the U.S. aircraft carrier needs to be provided in Japan to
maintain the forward-deployed capabilities of the carrier and its aircraft for a long time.

Japan and the United States agreed in June 2006 that the Government of Japan would carry out dredging

work in the restricted water area of Yokosuka Naval Base in order to ensure safe operations of the nuclear aircraft
carrier, George Washington, in preparation for the planned replacement of the U.S. aircraft carrier, Kitty Hawk,
in Japan Fiscal Year 2008, and that dredging work was conducted.

**b. Base for Carrier-Based Aircraft**
When the U.S. aircraft carrier is deployed in Yokosuka, Atsugi Air Facility (in Kanagawa Prefecture) is currently
used as a base for carrier-based aircraft. Since Atsugi Air Facility is located in the center of an urban district,
noise of carrier jets taking off and landing particularly had been problems for a long time.

These problems should be resolved as soon as possible in order to stably maintain the Japan-U.S. Security

Arrangements and the operations of carriers under the arrangements from now into the future.

After the completion of the runway relocation project at MCAS Iwakuni, the safe operations of aircraft will

be possible in a less intrusive manner.


-----

In consideration of these matters, Carrier Air Wing Five (CVW-5) squadrons will be relocated from Atsugi

Air Facility to MCAS Iwakuni. This relocation, consisting of F/A-18, EA-6B, E-2C and C-2 aircraft (59 aircraft
in total), will be completed by 2014, subsequent to the following: (1) completion of necessary facilities, and (2)
adjustment of training airspace and the Iwakuni RAPCON airspace.

The relocations will be conducted after the runway is moved offshore to mitigate impacts of the increased

operations at MCAS Iwakuni due to this relocation. Related measures will also be taken, including the relocation
of JMSDF’s EP-3 and other aircraft from MCAS Iwakuni to Atsugi Air Facility, the regular rotational deployment
of KC-130 aircraft (which are to be relocated from MCAS Futenma to MCAS Iwakuni) to JMSDF Kanoya Base
and Guam, and the relocation of U.S. Marine Corps CH-53D helicopters from MCAS Iwakuni to Guam.

It is expected that the area requiring residential noise-abatement work (so-called first category area) will

decrease from approximately 1,600ha of present area to 500ha. Thus, the noise around MCAS Iwakuni will
be alleviated. Furthermore, safety will be improved as the runway will be relocated offshore and approach and
takeoff routes will be established above the water. (See Fig. III-2-2-8)

As for field-carrier landing practice (FCLP), a bilateral framework to conduct a study on a permanent field
carrier landing practice facility is to be established with the goal of selecting a permanent site by July 2009 or
the earliest possible date thereafter. In addition, the SCC document confirmed that U.S. forces will continue to
conduct field-carrier landing practice at Iwo Jima in accordance with the existing temporary arrangements until
a permanent field-carrier landing practice training facility is identified.

**c. Commercial Airport at MCAS Iwakuni**
Considering that the local governments, including Yamaguchi Prefecture and Iwakuni City, have been working
as one to request the reopening of a commercial airport, the Governments of Japan and the United States have
been discussing within the framework of the Japan-U.S. Joint Committee to identify such issues as the relations
between commercial aviation resumption and the operations of U.S. forces and to study its feasibility. As a result,
in October 2005, it was agreed at the committee that commercial aviation operations of four round trips per day
would be allowed as long as such operations do not compromise U.S. military operational requirements.

This issue was then dealt with during the discussions on the realignment of USFJ. Since it was agreed

in the Roadmap that portions of the future civilian air facility would be accommodated at MCAS Iwakuni,
with coordination between Japan and the U.S., the locations of the civilian air facilities were indicated on the
Master Plan of airfield facility developments which had been developed by the U.S., and the Ministry of Defense
explained that to the local public governments in May 2007.

**(6) Ballistic Missile Defense (BMD)**
As confirmed in the examination on roles, missions and capabilities, Japan and the United States will continue
close coordination on BMD as the two countries improve their respective BMD capabilities.

In June 2006 the new U.S. Forward Based X-Band Transportable (FBX-T) Radar System (AN/TPY-2;

hereafter referred to as the “X-Band Radar System”) with the sophisticated capability to search and track ballistic
missiles was deployed to ASDF Shariki Air Station (in Aomori Prefecture) and operations commenced[14]. The
data obtained by the X-Band Radar System will be shared by the two countries. Thereby, the capabilities to
intercept missiles directed at Japan and capabilities for Japan’s civil protection and consequence management
will improve.

Also in October 2006 U.S. Army Patriot PAC-3 capabilities were deployed to Kadena Air Base and Kadena

Ammunition Storage Area, and in addition Aegis-equipped cruisers, which are forward-deployed in the Western
Pacific region, have been installed with BMD capabilities in turn since August 2006.

This deployment of U.S. forces’ BMD capabilities to Japan contributes to the improvement of our country’s

defense against missile attacks, the maintenance of deterrence of USFJ and the safety of Japanese citizens.


-----

**(7) Training Relocation**
Initially, aircraft from three U.S. facilities, Kadena Air
Base, Misawa Air Base (in Aomori Prefecture) and MCAS
Iwakuni will participate in relocated training conducted
at the following SDF facilities: Chitose (in Hokkaido),
Misawa, Hyakuri (in Ibaraki Prefecture), Komatsu (in
Ishikawa Prefecture), Tsuiki and Nyutabaru.

Since March 2007, U.S. forces have conducted

training relocation from Misawa Air Base, MCAS
Iwakuni and Kadena Air Base to ASDF Chitose, Misawa,
Hyakuri, Komatsu, Tsuiki, and Nyutabara Air Bases.

The Government of Japan is improving infrastructure Base

for training relocation at SDF facilities as necessary after
conducting site surveys.

Furthermore, the Regional Defense Bureaus are working to implement smooth training and have established

local communications headquarters in cooperation with the ASDF and to support the U.S. military in the conduct
of relocated training, by communicating with related local government organizations and responding to nearby
citizens concerned about their peace and safety during training.

**3. Initiatives for Smooth Implementation of the Realignment of USFJ**
The previously mentioned Roadmap intends to enhance the effectiveness of the Japan-U.S. Security
Arrangements, maintain deterrence and capabilities, and contribute to the long-awaited reduction of burdens on
local communities where USFJ facilities and areas are located.

In this connection, it is important to ensure the implementation of the efforts by the Government of Japan

regarding realignment of U.S. forces structure in Japan and others approved by the Cabinet in May 2006. (See
Reference 38)

The Law Concerning Special Measures on Smooth Implementation of the Realignment of U.S. Forces in

Japan and Related SDF Forces (hereafter referred to as the “USFJ Realignment Special Measures Law”) was
passed in May 2007 and enacted on August 29, 2007. Following is a general description of that law.

**1. Overview of the USFJ Realignment Special Measures Law**

**(1) Institutionalization of Provision of New Grants to Local Municipalities (Realignment**

**Grant)**

The realignment grant is a measure to be implemented by the Government for those local municipalities that
accept increased burdens to implement the realignment of USFJ, in appreciation of their contribution to the
maintenance of peace and security of Japan, and is needed for facilitating the smooth implementation of the
realignment of USFJ.

The realignment grant is awarded for different purposes than expenses for measures around bases[15],

which have been paid before, and will be used to improve the convenience of lives of residents in the local
communities[16] where the realignment is implemented and to contribute to the promotion of local industries[17],
during the period—10 years in principle—including time before and after the realignment.

The grant is awarded to related communities depending on the progress of USFJ realignment measures, after

the Ministry of Defense has specified defense facilities and nearby communities. This mechanism is appropriate
for the policy objective for the smooth implementation of the realignment of USFJ.


-----

**(2) Establishment of Exception to the Grant Rate for Public Works Projects, or Other**

**Treatment**

While burdens on local municipalities are increasing due to realignment, there are some whose burdens are
extremely heavy, for example, due to the relocation of units with many aircraft. These municipalities will be
required to carry out public works such as roads and ports promptly and special grant-rate measures targeted for
such municipalities will contribute to a smooth implementation of the realignment. However, the public works as
mentioned above will often be implemented by the national government or prefectures and, in some cases, will be
limited to certain municipalities. It is feared that the public works may be infeasible with the realignment grant.
Therefore, the USFJ Realignment Special Measures Law provides measures to promote industrial development
for the region consisting of municipalities with heavy burdens and surrounding municipalities[18] (Special Area for
Development concerning Realignment). (See Fig. III-2-2-13)

concerning Realignment of U.S. Forces in Japan and Related SDF Forces[19]) will be established under the
Ministry of Defense.

m The Governor of a prefecture will apply to Minister of Defense for the designation of Special Area for

Development concerning Realignment, and submit a development plan (Development Plan for Special
Area for Development concerning Realignment-draft), including public works projects for roads, ports and
others.

m Upon receipt of an application from the Governor of a prefecture, the Council will deliberate on the designation of

Special Area for Development concerning Realignment and on the decision of a development plan for the area[20].

**(3) Special Operations of Japan Bank for International Cooperation (JBIC) and Other Measures**
**a. Reasons Why Japan Shares Expenses of Relocating U.S. Forces to Guam**
The relocation of U.S. Marine Corps stationed in Okinawa out of the prefecture has been strongly desired by the
residents of Okinawa Prefecture. It is important to realize the relocation of U.S. Marine Corps from Okinawa to
Guam as soon as possible, which enables the reduction of burdens on Okinawa while maintaining the deterrence
and capabilities of the USFJ.

Therefore, the Government of Japan has actively approached the United States to negotiate the relocation. As

a result, the two countries agreed on the sharing of costs of the relocation. If the United States alone undertakes


-----

the development of necessary facilities and infrastructure in Guam, the task is expected to take a very long time,
despite the need to realize the relocation at an early date. Therefore, the Government of Japan decided to support
the United States in its development of necessary facilities, including Marine headquarters buildings, barracks and
family housing, and infrastructure. Japan will bear the cost for the relocation on the basis of actual requirement of
facilities and infrastructure. In other words, Japan will not bear the cost based on a certain percentage of the total
costs necessary for the relocation, which the United States requested in the negotiation.

Also, the development of family housing and infrastructure for Marine personnel will be funded by private

finance initiatives by means of equity investment and loans so that the Government of Japan’s financial burden
may be reduced as much as possible. The funds for projects that are raised by private finance initiatives will be
recovered by rents and service charges paid by the U.S. side in the future.

The agreed amounts of the costs of relocation to Guam to be shared by Japan and the United States are based on

the estimation prepared by the U.S. side at the stage of study, and therefore such amounts are only rough estimate.
To reduce and rationalize the amount of cost to be borne by Japan, it will be important for the Government of
Japan to carefully examine concrete project schemes and the detailed estimate for spending.

Therefore, GOJ will take budgetary measures only after thorough examinations have been made in cooperation

with JBIC and all efforts have been made to reduce the amount of costs required. (See Fig. III-2-2-14)

**Fig. III-2-2-14 Breakdown of Cost of Relocating U.S. Forces to Guam**

|Project|Col2|Sources|Amount|Col5|
|---|---|---|---|---|
|Cost borne by Japan|Marine headquarters buildings, instruction buildings, barracks and QOL facilities including schools|(Direct) fiscal spending|$2.8 billion (upper limit)||
||Family housing|Equity investment|$1.5 billion|$2.55 billion|
|||Loans, etc.|$0.63 billion||
|||Cost reduction by improved efficiency|$0.42 billion||
||Infrastructure (electricity, potable water and sewage, and waste disposal)|Loans, etc.|$0.74 billion||
||Total||$6.09 billion||
|Cost borne by the United States|Helidromes, communication facilities, training support facilities, maintenance and refilling facilities, fuel and ammunition warehouses and other basic facilities|(Direct) fiscal spending|$3.18 billion||
||Roads (high-standard roads)|Loans or (direct) fiscal spending|$1 billion||
||Total||$4.18 billion||
|Aggregate amount|||$10.27 billion||



Notes: 1. The amounts and schemes are subject to change.
2. Japan is committed to sharing cost not according to the ratio to the total amount but based on

the amount required for each of the facilities and infrastructures.

The cost will be further examined and thus upper limits are shown for (direct) fiscal spending.

3. As for family housing, the cost was reduced by $0.42 billion (by improved efficiency) from $2.55

billion to $2.13 billion.

4. As for equity investment and loans, the amount spent will be recovered through rents and fees paid

by the United States.

5. The cost of moving the Marine Corps from Okinawa to Guam and the cost for the Corps’ activities

in Guam are not included in the aggregate amount of $10.27 billion.


-----

**b. Outline of Special Financial Operations of JBIC**
To properly and stably implement overseas projects for which private finance initiative is utilized for a long
period, it will be necessary to employ the capability of JBIC which has expertise and experience in this field.

Therefore, it was decided to authorize JBIC to conduct financial services for facilitating the USFJ realignment

as exceptional measures under the USFJ Realignment Special Measures Law, so that JBIC may make capital
investments, loans and other operations that will be needed for projects to facilitate the relocation of U.S. Marine
Corps in Okinawa to Guam, and to authorize the Government of Japan to take special financial measures for such
operations. (See Fig. III-2-2-15)

**(4) Measures for USFJ Local Employees**
The employment of USFJ local employees may be adversely affected, because defense facilities will be returned,
U.S. Marine Corps in Okinawa will relocate to Guam, and other measures will be taken as a result of the
realignment of USFJ.

Therefore, the Government of Japan decided to take measures to maintain the employment of USFJ local

employees, including education and skill training.

**(5) Validity of the Law**
m The law shall be valid for 10 years.
m Despite the validity of the law, measures including special operations of JBIC shall remain effective for a

considerable length of time.

**2. Measures based on the USFJ Realignment Special Measures Law**
Based on the USFJ Realignment Special Measures Law, 14 defense facilities and 33 municipalities were
identified as realignment defense facilities and realignment municipalities qualified for realignment grants in
October 2007, and in November 2007 three municipalities related to Camp Hansen were additionally identified,
and Iwakuni City, Nago City and Ginoza Village were additionally identified in March 2008.


-----

**4. Various Measures Concerning USFJ Facilities and Areas**
Ensuring the stable use of the USFJ facilities and areas is essential for the achievement of the objectives of the
Japan-U.S. Security Treaty. The Government of Japan has long been implementing measures to harmonize the
stable use of these facilities and areas with requests of the surrounding local communities.

**1. USFJ Facilities and Areas Located in Japan, Excluding Okinawa**

**(1) Iwakuni Runway Relocation Project**
In response to requests of Iwakuni City and other local
governments, the Government of Japan has decided
to proceed with the project to relocate the runway
approximately 1,000 meters to the east (offshore) in
order to solve problems related to operations, safety and
noise and to ensure the stable use of MCAS Iwakuni.
(See 2 of this section)

**(2) Realignment of USFJ Facilities and Areas**

**in Kanagawa Prefecture** Iwakuni Air Base runway relocation construction in progress

Considering that local governments concerned and other
organizations have strongly requested the return of USFJ
facilities and areas in Kanagawa Prefecture, the Governments of Japan and the United States held consultations
on the ideal state of these facilities and areas. As a result of consultations, the two countries reached a common
understanding regarding a basic stance on the release of the six facilities and areas in Yokohama City, including
Kamiseya Communication Station, and the construction of approximately 700 units of U.S. family housing in the
Yokohama City portion of Ikego Housing Area and Navy Annex. The Japan-U.S. Joint Committee agreed upon
the result of the consultation in October 2004.

The construction of U.S. family housing will: 1) pave the way for the extensive return of six USFJ facilities and

areas (approximately 419ha in total) in Kanagawa Prefecture; and 2) solve the current housing shortage problem
of U.S. Navy in Japan. In addition, it is essential to achieve the objectives of the Japan- U.S. Security Treaty.
Therefore, the Ministry of Defense is making utmost efforts to realize the abovementioned housing construction
through coordination with the United States and local governments concerned through such procedures as design
and environmental impact assessment. (See Fig. III-2-2-16)

Of these six facilities and areas, the whole land area of Koshiba POL Depot was returned to Japan in

December 2005. As for the remaining five facilities and areas, the Ministry of Defense will be attentive to the
requests of related local governments concerning the use of land, and will ask the United States to return them
as soon as possible.

**2. USFJ Facilities and Areas in Okinawa**
As of January 2008, approximately 74% of the area of USFJ facilities and area (for exclusive use) are concentrated
in Okinawa Prefecture, and they take up approximately 10% of the area of the prefecture, and approximately 18%
of the area of the main island of Okinawa. Therefore, the Cabinet and the Government as a whole are addressing
the issues related to Okinawa as one of the most important tasks. The Ministry of Defense, for its own part, has
so far been strongly committed to implementing a number of measures to resolve these issues, while at the same
time, harmonizing the achievement of objectives of the Japan-U.S. Security Treaty with the requests of local
communities.

Of these measures, the Ministry of Defense believes that the steady implementation of the proposals set

out in the Final Report of the Special Action Committee on Okinawa (SACO), which was completed by the
Governments of Japan and the United States, would be the most reliable way to reduce the burden on the people
of Okinawa. Therefore, the Ministry of Defense is making efforts to realize the proper and rapid implementation
of such proposals. (See 2 of this section)

**(1) Efforts for Realignment, Consolidation and Reduction before the Establishment of SACO**
When Okinawa was returned to Japan in 1972, the Government of Japan provided 83 facilities and areas
covering approximately 278km[2] for exclusive use by USFJ under the Japan-U.S. Security Treaty. However, their
concentration in Okinawa has led to strong calls for their realignment and reduction on the grounds that regional
promotion and development projects are restricted and the lives of residents are seriously affected.

In view of these circumstances, both countries have continued their efforts to realign, consolidate and reduce

USFJ facilities and areas, focusing on issues that are strongly voiced by local communities. In light of the
items identified by the joint statement issued by then Prime Minister Eisaku Sato of Japan and then President


-----

Richard Nixon of the United States in 1972, a plan for the realignment and consolidation of USFJ facilities and
areas in Okinawa was endorsed by the Security Consultative Committee (SCC) held in 1973, 1974 and 1976.
It was agreed at the meeting of the Japan-U.S. Joint Committee of 1990 that both sides would proceed with the
necessary adjustments and procedures for the release of land, known as the 23 Issues.

Meanwhile, under the agreement reached at the Japan-U.S. Summit of 1995 regarding the so-called Three

Okinawa Issues (the release of Naha Port, the return of Yomitan Auxiliary Airfield, and the relocation of artillery
live-fire training over Highway 104) strongly demanded by the residents of the prefecture, it was agreed that
efforts would be made to resolve the issues. (See Reference 42)

**(2) Circumstances Surrounding the Establishment of SACO and Other Matters**
Public interest in Okinawa-related issues heightened across the country in response to an unfortunate incident that
occurred in 1995 as well as the refusal of the then Governor of Okinawa to sign land lease renewal documents
under the Special Measures Law for USFJ Land.

In the belief that the burden on the people of Okinawa should be reduced as much as possible and shared

by the whole nation, the Government has, for the sake of future development of Okinawa, decided to put even
greater efforts into bringing about steady progress in the realignment, consolidation and relocation of USFJ
facilities and areas, and to do its utmost to take measures for industrial development in Okinawa. In order to hold
consultations on issues related to USFJ facilities and areas in Okinawa, the Government established the Okinawa
Action Council between the central government and Okinawa Prefecture, and SACO between Japan and the
United States in 1995.

Since then, the issues on Okinawa were intensely discussed for about one year, and the so-called SACO Final

Report was compiled in 1996.

**(3) Overview of the SACO Final Report and Progress**
The SACO Final Report stipulates the return of land (the total return of six facilities, including MCAS Futenma,
and the partial return of five others, such as the Northern Training Area), the adjustment of training and operational
procedures (the termination of artillery live-fire training over Highway 104 and the dispersed implementation of
similar live-fire training in maneuver areas on mainland Japan), the implementation of noise-reduction initiatives,
and the improvement of operational procedures under the Status of Forces Agreement. The land to be returned
based on the SACO Final Report represents approximately 21% (about 50km[2]) of USFJ facilities and areas in
Okinawa, exceeding the roughly 43km[2] of land returned during the period between the reversion of Okinawa and
the implementation of the SACO Final Report.

The facilities and areas relating to the SACO Final Report and the major progress status are described in Fig.

III-2-2-17 and Fig. III-2-2-18.

The changes in the numbers and area of USFJ facilities and areas (for exclusive use) as a result of the efforts

described above are described in Fig. III-2-2-19.

The Ministry of Defense will continue to make its maximum efforts aiming at realizing the SACO Final

Report with the understanding and support of local communities.

**(4) Efforts for the Use of Returned Land Used for USFJ Facilities and Areas**
On release of the land used for USFJ facilities and areas, the Ministry of Defense has taken measures to restore
vacated land to its original state by removing buildings and structures, and to provide benefits for the owner of
the land in accordance with the Special Measures Law for USFJ Land Release. Under the Special Measures Law
for Okinawa Development (enforced in 2002), benefits are provided for the owner of large-scale vacated land or
designated vacated land.

Section 3. Policies and Measures for Enhancing Credibility of the Japan-U.S.

Security Arrangements

It is necessary to make incessant efforts to ensure the continued effectiveness and enhance the credibility of
the Japan-U.S. Security Arrangements. The following section explains the relevant measures other than those
mentioned in the preceding section.

**1. Japan-U.S. Policy Consultations**

**1. Major Forums for Japan-U.S. Consultations on Security**
Close policy consultations on security are conducted through diplomatic channels as well as between officials in
charge of defense and foreign affairs at multiple levels of the Governments of Japan and the United States through
the Security Consultative Committee (SCC) (so-called two-plus-two meeting), the Security Subcommittee (SSC)
and the Subcommittee for Defense Cooperation (SDC). The framework of these consultations is shown in Fig.
III-2-3-1.

Notes: 1. The U.S. side was headed by the U.S. Ambassador to Japan and the Commander-in-Chief of the U.S. Pacific Command before December 26, 1990.
2. Meetings are held from time to time between working-level officials of the two Governments, such as officials corresponding in rank to vice minister or

assistant secretary.

3. A Council of Deputies consisting of Deputy-Director General and Deputy Assistant Secretaries was established when the SDC was recognized on June 28,

1996.

4. Then Director-General of the Bureau of Defense Operations was added on September 23, 1997.


-----

In addition, the Ministry of Defense organizes Japan-U.S. defense ministerial meetings between the Minister

of Defense of Japan and the U.S. Secretary of Defense as necessary where discussions are made with a focus on
defense policies of the respective governments and defense cooperation.

Furthermore, the Ministry of Defense has held working-level meetings when necessary to exchange information

with the U.S. Department of Defense and others under the Japan-U.S. Security Arrangements. The importance of
these opportunities has further increased as Japan-U.S. defense cooperation has been enhanced in recent years.

The sharing of information and views at every opportunity and level between Japan and the United States

is undoubtedly conducive to increased credibility of the Japan-U.S. Security Arrangements, through further
enhancement of close collaboration between the two countries. Therefore, the Ministry of Defense is proactively
involved in these activities.

**2. Recent Policy Consultations between Japan and the United States**
The Japan-U.S. policy consultations (ministerial level) conducted since 2005 are shown in Fig. III-2-3-2. Defense
Ministerial Meetings were conducted between then Defense Minister Koike and Secretary of Defense Gates on
August 8, 2007 and between former Defense Minister Ishiba and Secretary of Defense Gates on November 8,
2007. Furthermore, utilizing the opportunity created by the 7th International Institute for Strategic Studies Asian
Security Summit, former Defense Minister Ishiba and Secretary of Defense Gates held a Defense Ministerial
Meeting in Singapore on May 31 of this year.

The two countries conduct consultations not only at a ministerial level but also at working levels.

**(1) Japan-U.S. Defense Ministerial Meeting (August 8, 2007)**

The outline of the meeting held between then Defense Minister Koike and Secretary of Defense Gates is as

follows.

**a. Intelligence Security**
Minister Koike expressed her recognition that intelligence security was the largest challenge for her term of
office, and her commitment not only to the Defense Ministry’s utmost efforts but also to government-wide efforts
including those in areas of counter-intelligence. The two sides exchanged views on the importance for Japan and
the U.S. to work together to strengthen intelligence security.

**b. Realignment of USFJ**
The two sides agreed on the early materialization of the realignment in accordance with the Roadmap.

The Japanese side stated after the submission of the Environmental Impact Assessment Scoping Document to

Okinawa Prefecture, the Futenma Replacement Facility plan should proceed. Regarding areas south of Kadena,
the Japanese side requested the early return of the maximum scale of land from Camp Zukeran upon which the
U.S. side replied, saying they would work towards the return but many other considerations were necessary.
The Japanese side also stated that the early relocation to Guam would be beneficial for both Japan and the U.S.,
bearing in mind financial efficiency. Both sides agreed on the continuous cooperation of the study group work
for the joint use of Yokota Air Base.

**c. Replacement of Fighters (F-X)**
In response to a statement by the Japanese side of its wishes for future examinations on capabilities required for
defense of Japan in the changing East Asian environment, the U.S. side commented that the F-X program was
also an important issue to the U.S and suggested bilateral examinations on what capabilities were necessary for
the Japan-U.S. Alliance.

**2.** **Guidelines for Japan-U.S. Defense Cooperation and Policies to Ensure their Effectiveness**

**1. The Guidelines for Japan-U.S. Defense Cooperation**
In 1996, the reexamination of the Guidelines for Japan-U.S. Defense Cooperation[21] was announced through the JapanU.S. Joint Declaration on Security. With the announcement, Japan and the U.S. both reviewed the previous guidelines
in order to enhance credibility towards Japan-U.S. security, and a new version of the Guidelines for Japan-U.S. Defense
Cooperation (hereafter referred to as the “Guidelines”) was acknowledged at the Security Consultative Committee
(SCC) (so-called the two-plus-two meeting) in September 1997. The outline is as follows. (See Reference 40)

**(1) Objectives of the Guidelines**
The Guidelines aim to create a solid basis for more effective and reliable Japan-U.S. cooperation under normal
circumstances, in case of an armed attack against Japan and situations in areas surrounding Japan.

**(2) Matters for Cooperation Prescribed in the Guidelines**
**a. Cooperation under Normal Circumstances**
Both governments will maintain close cooperation for the defense of Japan and for the creation of a more stable
international security environment, and will promote cooperation in various fields under normal circumstances.
Such cooperation includes information sharing and policy consultations; security dialogues and defense exchanges;
U.N. Peacekeeping Operations (PKOs) and international humanitarian operations; bilateral defense planning, and
mutual cooperation planning; enhancing bilateral exercises and training; and establishing a bilateral coordination
mechanism.

**b. Actions in Response to Armed Attack against Japan**
Bilateral actions in response to an armed attack against Japan remain a core aspect of Japan-U.S. defense
cooperation. As can be seen in Fig. III-2-3-3, the SDF will take initiative in defense operations[22] while the U.S.
forces conduct operations to supplement and support the SDF’s operations based on respective concepts of
operations in a coordinated manner.

**Fig. III-2-3-3 Concept of Operations When an Armed Attack against Japan Takes Place**

**(3) Bilateral Programs under the Guidelines**
In order to promote Japan-U.S. cooperation under the Guidelines in an effective manner and to achieve positive
results without fail, the two countries need to hold consultative dialogues throughout the spectrum of security
conditions mentioned above. In addition, both sides must be well informed at various levels and undertake
appropriate coordination to attain such objectives. To that end, the two governments will strengthen their
information and intelligence-sharing and policy consultations by taking advantage of all available opportunities,
and will establish the following two mechanisms for facilitation of consultations, policy coordination, and
coordination of operations and activity areas.

**a. Comprehensive Mechanism**
The Comprehensive Mechanism has been created so that not only the SDF and U.S. forces but also the
relevant agencies of the respective governments conduct bilateral works based on the Guidelines under normal
circumstances. In the comprehensive mechanism, bilateral work such as bilateral defense planning and mutual
cooperation planning will be conducted to respond smoothly and effectively to armed attacks against Japan and
to situations in areas surrounding Japan. (See Fig. III-2-3-5)

**b. Coordination Mechanism**
The coordination mechanism, established in 2000, is being set up in normal circumstances so that the two
countries may coordinate their respective activities in the event of an armed attack against Japan and in situations
in areas surrounding Japan. (See Fig. III-2-3-6)

**2. Various Policies for Ensuring the Effectiveness of the Guidelines**

**(1) Measures for Ensuring the Effectiveness of the Guidelines**
In order to secure effectiveness of the Guidelines, it is important to properly take necessary measures, including
legal ones, regarding Japan-U.S. cooperation in case of armed attack situations and situations in areas surrounding
Japan. From this perspective, it is necessary for the Government of Japan as a whole to collaborate in advancing
bilateral work between Japan and the United States, including examination of bilateral defense planning and
mutual cooperation planning of the Guidelines in peacetime.

Laws such as the Law concerning Measures to Ensure the Peace and Security of Japan in Situations in

Areas Surrounding Japan and the Ship Inspection Operations Law are being established in light of Japan-U.S.
cooperation in areas surrounding Japan.

Also, measures are being taken to facilitate U.S. force operations as a part of strengthening of security
cooperation legislation for situations such as armed attacks.

**(2) Outline of the Law concerning Measures to Ensure the Peace and Security of Japan in**

**Situations in Areas Surrounding Japan and the Ship Inspection Operations Law**

The Law concerning Measures to Ensure the Peace and Security of Japan in Situations in Areas Surrounding
Japan establishes the measures that Japan will implement in response to situations in areas surrounding Japan and
the actual implementation procedures. The Ship Inspection Operations Law provides for the types, measures and
other matters of ship inspection operations implemented by Japan in response to situations in areas surrounding
Japan. Its outline is as follows.

The Prime Minister, facing a situation in areas surrounding Japan and deeming it necessary to adopt measures

including such SDF activities as rear area support[24], rear area search and rescue operations, and ship inspection
operations, must request a Cabinet decision on such measures and on a draft basic plan of response measures.

The Prime Minister reports to the Diet without delay when the Cabinet has made a decision or approved its

revision, or when the response measures have been completed.

**(3) Rear Area Support**
Rear area support means support measures, including the provision of goods, services and conveniences, given
by Japan in rear areas to U.S. Forces conducting activities that contribute to the achievement of the objectives
of the Japan-U.S. Security Treaty in situations in areas surrounding Japan. (Article 3, Paragraph 1, Item 1 of the
Law concerning Measures to Ensure the Peace and Security of Japan in Situations in Areas Surrounding Japan)

As rear area support, the SDF provides goods and services, including supplies, transportation, repair,

maintenance, medical services, communications, airport and seaport activities and base activities.

**(4) Rear Area Search and Rescue Operations**
Rear area search and rescue operations mean operations conducted by Japan in situations in areas surrounding
Japan to search and rescue those who engage in combat and are shot down in rear areas (including transporting


-----

those rescued). (Article 3, Paragraph 1, Item 2 of the Law concerning the Measures to Ensure the Peace and
Security of Japan in Situations in Areas Surrounding Japan).

If one does not engage but still faces a mishap he/she will be also rescued. In addition, if there is anyone in

the territorial waters of a foreign country adjacent to the implementation area in which the SDF is conducting
activities, the SDF will also rescue that person, after having obtained approval from that foreign country. However,
this is limited to cases in which no combat operations are conducted at that time and are expected to be conducted
in the waters throughout the period during which the SDF conducts rescue activities.

**(5) Ship Inspection Operations**
Ship inspection operations mean operations conducted by Japan in situations in areas surrounding Japan to inspect
and confirm the cargo and destination of ships (excluding warships and others[26]) and to request, if necessary a
change of sea route, or destination port or place, for the purpose of strictly enforcing the regulatory measures
concerning trade or other economic activities to which Japan is a party. These activities are conducted based on
the U.N. Security Council Resolution or the consent of the flag state[27] in the territorial waters of Japan or in the
surrounding high seas (including the EEZ[28]) (Article 2 of the Ship Inspection Operations Law).

**3. Japan-U.S. Bilateral Training and Exercises**
Bilateral training and exercises conducted by the SDF and U.S. Forces are useful for enhancing their respective
tactical skills[29]. Bilateral training and exercises are also indispensable as a means of facilitating mutual
understanding and close communication under normal circumstances, thereby improving interoperability and
ensuring the smooth conduct of Japan-U.S. bilateral actions. In addition, it is important for the SDF to conduct
necessary trainings for collaboration and coordination between the SDF and U.S. Forces in normal circumstances
so that the SDF may carry out the missions conferred by the Law concerning the Measures to Ensure the Peace
and Security of Japan in Situations in Areas Surrounding Japan, and other laws. Such efforts serve to maintain
and enhance the credibility and deterrent effect of the Japan-U.S. Security Arrangements.

Therefore, the SDF has conducted a variety of bilateral training and exercises with U.S. Forces, and

maintains a policy to enhance these training and exercises in the future. For example, Joint Staff Office and units
from the GSDF, MSDF, ASDF and U.S. Forces participated in the Japan-U.S. Bilateral Joint Training Exercise
last November, which was the first field exercise after transferring to a joint operations posture. Bilateral joint
operations capabilities were maintained and enhanced through actual training on the coordination procedures
among the three SDF forces as well as between SDF and U.S. Forces in cases of armed attack situations in Japan
and the surrounding areas. (See Reference 41)

**4. The Acquisition and Cross-Servicing Agreement between Japan and the United States (ACSA)**
The basic principle of the Acquisition and Cross-Servicing Agreement between Japan and the United States
(ACSA)[30] is that if either side requests the provision of goods or services, the other side should provide these
goods or services[31]. The Agreement is designed to positively contribute to the smooth and effective operation
of the Japan-U.S. Security Treaty and to efforts for international peace made under the leadership of the United
Nations. Its scope of application includes various occasions such as bilateral training and exercises in peacetime,
U.N. PKOs, situations in areas surrounding Japan, and armed attack situations. (See Fig. III-2-3-7)

Significance of reciprocal provision of supplies and services

In general, supplies and services necessary for unit
operations are replenished by themselves. However, in
case the units of allied nations are operating together,
the reciprocal provision of supplies and services at
sites would enhance the flexibility of the operations.


**5. Mutual Exchanges of Equipment and Technology**
There is need for both Japan and the U.S. to aggressively promote cooperation in areas of equipment and
technology while bearing in mind the maintenance of Japan’s technology and production base and the mutual
cooperation principle based on the Japan-U.S. Security Treaty and the Mutual Defense Assistance Agreement
between Japan and the United States of America.

In view of the progress in technological cooperation between Japan and the United States, the improvement of

technological level, and other factors, Japan decided to transfer its military technology to the United States despite
the provisions of the Three Principles on Armed Exports and other regulations. And, in 1983, Japan concluded
the Exchange of Notes concerning the Transfer of Military Technologies to the United States of America[32]. In
June 2006, the Governments of Japan and the United
States concluded the Exchange of Notes concerning the
Transfer of Arms and Military Technologies to the United
States of America[33] to replace the foregoing Exchange of
Notes. (See Part II, Chapter 2, Section 2)

Under these frameworks, the Government of Japan has

decided to provide the United States with 17 items of arms
and military technology, including portable surface-to-air
missile (PSAM) technology and weapon technologies
related to joint technological research on BMD.

Japan and the United States consult with each other

at forums such as the Systems and Technology Forum
(S&TF), which provides opportunities for exchanging Former Senior Vice-Minister of Defense Eto holds a press conference after the

conduct cooperative research and development regarding the specific projects agreed upon at the forums. Since
1992, the two countries have concluded the joint project agreement, and conducted 17 joint projects, 11 of which
have been completed. Japan-U.S. cooperation in military equipment and technology is significant for improving
interoperability and reducing R&D costs and risks, and the two countries have been examining the possibility of
expanding joint research projects in the future. (See Fig. III-2-3-8)

**6. Measures to Ensure the Smooth Stationing of USFJ**
The stationing of USFJ forms the core of the Japan-U.S. Security Arrangements and also demonstrates the U.S.’s
deep commitment to Japan and the Asia-Pacific region. The USFJ has been contributing to the peace and stability
of the region in various ways. In particular, their presence itself is considered to function as a visible deterrent.
Thus, the Government of Japan has already taken various measures to ensure the smooth stationing of USFJ and
enhance the credibility of the Japan-U.S. Security Arrangements.

**1. Cost Sharing for the Stationing of USFJ**

**(1) Cost Sharing for the Stationing of USFJ**
The cost sharing for the stationing of USFJ is important to ensure the smooth and effective implementation of the
Japan-U.S. Security Arrangements. From this point of view, the Government of Japan has made efforts as much
as possible within the scope of the Status of Forces Agreement or based on the Special Measures Agreement[34],
with due consideration for its financial situation and other factors. At present, the Ministry of Defense bears cost
for the stationing of USFJ. (See Fig. III-2-3-9)

|Col1|Fig. III-2-3-9 Outline of Cost Sharing for the Stationing of USFJ|Col3|
|---|---|---|
|Item|Outline|Ground|
|Costs for Facilities Improvement Program (FIP)1| Barracks, family housing, environmental facilities, etc. have been constructed in the USFJ facilities and areas by the Japanese side since JFY 1979 and furnished to USFJ|Within the framework of the Status of Forces Agreement|
|Labor costs| Welfare costs, etc. since JFY 1978 and pay that exceeds the one equal to the pay conditions of national public employees since JFY 1979 have been borne by the Japanese side|Within the framework of the Status of Forces Agreement|
|| Eight kinds of allowances such as Adjustment Allowance have been borne by the Japanese side since JFY 1987|Special Measures Agreement (JFY 1987)|
|| Basic pay, etc. have been borne by the Japanese side since JFY 1991 (By gradually increasing the costs borne by the Japanese side, the total amount has been borne within the scope of the upper limit of the number of workers since JFY 1995)|Special Measures Agreement (JFY 1991)|
|Utilities costs| Fee or charge for electricity, gas, water supply, sewerage and fuels (for heating, cooking or hot water supply) have been borne by the GOJ since JFY 1991 (By gradually increasing the costs borne by the GOJ, the total amount has been borne within the scope of the upper limit of the procured quantity since JFY 1995)|Special Measures Agreement (JFY 1991)|
|| The upper limit of the procured quantity provided in the Special Measures Agreement (JFY 1996) has been cut by 10% after subtracting the quantity of the off-base U.S. residential housing since JFY 2001|Special Measures Agreement (JFY 2001)|
|| The GOJ will bear the costs for fuels etc. equivalent to the JFY 2007 budget of 25.3 billion yen for JFY 2008, and those equivalent to 24.9 billion yen, a reduction of 1.5% from the JFY 2007 budget for JFY 2009 and 2010|Special Measures Agreement (JFY 2008)|
|Training relocation costs| Additionally required costs incident to the relocation of the training requested by the GOJ have been borne by the GOJ since JFY 1996|Special Measures Agreement (JFY 1996)|



Note: Concerning the costs for FIP, the Government of Japan formulated “Criteria for adopting the FIP projects” to make an effort for efficiency in implementation of FIP as

follows: 1) Concerning facilities contributing to the improvement of foundation for the stationing of USFJ (bachelor housing, family housing and others), the
Government of Japan improves those facilities steadily by considering necessity, urgency and other factors; and 2) Concerning welfare facilities such as recreational
facilities and entertainment-oriented facilities, the Government of Japan especially scrutinizes the necessity and refrains from newly adopting the facilities regarded as
entertainment-oriented and profitable (shopping malls and others).

Under the new SMA put into effect this May, the sharing of labor costs and training relocation costs will be

maintained within a framework of the previous SMA; while utilities costs will be reduced at a fixed rate. The
new agreement also states that the U.S. Government will make further efforts to economize its expenditures.
Furthermore, an agreement was made between the U.S. and Japanese Governments for a comprehensive review
of cost sharing for the stationing of USFJ in order to enhance its efficiency and effectiveness.

**(2) Review of USFJ Local Employee Wages (Abolishment of USFJ Differential, etc.)**
Taking into consideration a working environment with a different language and customs, Japan had borne USFJ
differential and language allowance. However, it was decided that these allowances, which are not authorized for
National Public Service personnel, would be abolished in JFY 2008 from a viewpoint of rationality of the wage system
due to the drastic changes in social circumstances since around the early 1950s when they were first introduced,
while the uniqueness of working at a USFJ facility under the control of U.S. military personnel is still recognized.

Additionally, it was decided to reduce the retirement allowance to a level for national public employees from

JFY 2008 following the reform of the retirement allowance system for national public employees in 2005.

Taking into consideration the length of implementation of these systems, which have become a part of cost-of
living pay, Japan guarantees the present wage levels for incumbent employees and enforces measures to minimize
drastic change for five years, which will be reviewed in five years. (See Column (USFJ Local Employees))

*The grand total has dropped by 4.1%
from the previous year.

Note: Numbers in ( ) represent the relative composition within the whole.

**(3) Measures taken in Addition to Cost Sharing for the Stationing of USFJ**
In addition to the cost sharing for the stationing of USFJ, the Government of Japan bears the necessary costs for
USFJ facilities and areas (rental fees for facilities and others), takes measures to improve the living environment
in the surrounding areas of these facilities and areas, and devises relief measures for the unemployment of USFJ
local employees. A base subsidy[35] and others are provided to the municipalities as a substitute for property tax.
(See Fig. III-2-3-10)

**2. Ensuring the Stable Use of USFJ Facilities and Areas**
The Government has concluded lease contracts with owners of private and public land on which these facilities
and areas exist in order to ensure the stable use of necessary U.S. facilities and areas. However, should the
Government be unable to obtain the approval of land owners, it will acquire a title[37] under the Special Measures
Law for USFJ Land[36].

In addition, the Government has promoted measures related to USFJ facilities and areas (for exclusive use)

in order to balance between accomplishing objectives of the Japan-U.S. Security Treaty and meeting requests of
the surrounding communities. (See Section 2-4)

Moreover, in the vicinities of U.S. facilities and areas, the incidents and accidents caused by U.S. military

personnel, etc.,[38 ]such as the assault incident by U.S. Marine Corps personnel in February 2008 in Okinawa, have
affected local residents.


-----

The Government of Japan has requested USFJ to take effective measures for the prevention of recurrence,

such as educating personnel and enforcing strict discipline among them, and is cooperating in preventive
measures. The Government of Japan has also taken measures for prompt and appropriate compensation for the
damage caused by such incidents and accidents.

**3. Efforts to Preserve the Environment Surrounding USFJ Facilities and Areas**
Concerning environmental issues surrounding USFJ facilities and areas, at the two-plus-two meeting held in
September 2000, the Governments of Japan and the United States, in recognition of the importance of environmental
protection associated with USFJ facilities and areas, agreed to make it a common purpose to ensure the health
and safety of U.S. Forces personnel and their dependents, and announced the Joint Statement of Environmental
Principles[39]. In order to follow up on this statement, Japan-U.S. consultations have been more frequently held.
Specifically, related ministries and agencies have been engaged in discussions regarding strengthened cooperation
at the time of periodic reviews of the Japan Environmental Governing Standards (JEGS)[40], exchange of
environmental information, and response to environmental contamination in collaboration with each other. In
addition, at the two-plus-two meeting held in May 2006, the two countries confirmed the importance of improved
implementation of the Status of Forces Agreement (SOFA), including proper attention to the environment.

Since September 2006, Japanese and U.S. officials have held working-level meetings on disaster prevention

and safety measures for nuclear aircraft carriers keeping the replacements of the carriers in mind, and the JapanU.S. joint exercise was conducted last November with the participation of governmental organizations, the city of
Yokosuka and the U.S. Navy.

**[COLUMN]**

**COMMENTARY**

**USFJ Local Employees**

Paragraph 4, Article XII of the Status of Forces Agreement states that the local labor requirement shall be
satisfied with the assistance of Japanese authorities. Under this provision, the Government of Japan hires USFJ
local employees[1] to work at USFJ facilities as office clerks, technicians, drivers, security guards, mariners who
perform non-combat duties aboard U.S. ships, the home ports of which are in Japan, waiters and sales staff in
cafeterias, shops, etc. within the Headquarters and units, etc. of USFJ, and other roles required by the USFJ.

Throughout Japan, there are 25,260 people working at USFJ bases as USFJ employees (as of March

31, 2008). These employees play an extremely important role by helping to ensure the smooth and
effective operation of the Japan-U.S. Security Arrangements, which are a pillar of Japan’s defense.

U.S. Fleet Activities, Yokosuka (Kanagawa)

1) Besides the USFJ, the USFJ local employees are also hired in various organizations established with the U.S. Government’s

non-appropriated funds, such as the PX, cafeterias, etc. for the welfare of military personnel, civilian personnel and their
families.

**VOICE**

**Voice of SDF Personnel who Completed a Flight Training Course with the U.S. Air Force**

**Lieutenant Junior Grade Nobutake Kimura**

**Navigation Student**

**Flight Training Squadron 23, ASDF**

When I heard them say “You’re a foreigner, what can you do?” I
was frustrated by the reality of my helplessness, and felt extremely
disgraced. The remarks were not blatant discrimination; I was told
this after I had made mistakes during training and been slow to
understand the instructor’s directions.

The fact that it was the United States was not the particular

reason for my difficulties, but emotionally these were very tough
times for me.

However, not everything was bad.
My flight training course with the United States Air Force

allowed me to see the world.

I was given an inside look at the most powerful Air Force in the

world from which I was able to watch conflicts and troop movements
all over the world. Conflicts are steeped in complex relationships
that involve a wide-range of factors such as politics and economics,
religion, and history, and from my training in this course, I was able Lieutenant Junior Grade Kimura boarding the cockpit of

the U.S. Air Force AT-38 training aircraft

to grasp things from an even broader range of perspectives.

Moreover, I forged relationships with people from around the

world who also took part in the U.S. training which I will treasure for the rest of my life.

At the end of the training, I received an award for excellence. I was very proud to have my efforts

recognized in this way. But even after receiving the award, I felt my existence would be meaningless if I were
to fail a mission, therefore, I plan to spare no effort in achieving my next goal.

I returned to Japan from the United States, and my goal now is to graduate from the F-15 flight training

course and become a full-fledged pilot within my squadron.

As an additional option for the future, I have been considering applying to the test pilot school in the

United States. I would be able to make use of research at graduate school (School of General Policy Studies,
Department of Policy/Media Research) and my flight training experience in the United States, which could
lead to my potential involvement in the development of future fighter aircraft.

The U.S. flight training course allows you to master flying techniques, while at the same time, to

master English at a high level. The improved English ability of one individual ultimately contributes to
overall organizational strength. I strongly believe that personnel who have the opportunity should take this
course—the things you gain are of extremely great value.

Improvement of the International Security Environment

**Section 2. Promotion of Security Dialogue and Defense Exchanges**
**Section 3. Efforts for Arms Control, Disarmament and Non-Proliferation**


-----

Section 1. Efforts to Support International Peace Cooperation Activities

At present, the international community faces a range of global-scale problems, such as international terrorism,
proliferation of weapons of mass destruction, complex and various conflicts and international crimes. Globalization
has raised concerns that the occurrence of events even in regions far from Japan will pose a threat to the country
or have an impact on the country.

In light of the difficulty for a single country to respond to and solve these global threats and the need to take

an approach to addressing these threats not only on the military front but also on various other fronts, it is widely
recognized that the international community should join hands in coping with these threats.

On the basis of the efforts made by the international community, Japan’s defense and security goals set forth

in the National Defense Program Guidelines (NDPG) are to improve the international security environment to
reduce the potential threats to Japan. As a result, the NDPG also states that Japan will promote diplomatic efforts
including the use of Official Development Assistance (ODA), and, proactively and on its own initiative, Japan
will work on activities that nations of the world cooperatively undertake to enhance the international security
environment (hereinafter referred to as “international peace cooperation activities”).

Upon the transition from the Defense Agency to the Ministry of Defense in January 2007, missions of the

Self-Defense Forces (SDF) were reviewed and the international peace cooperation activities were stipulated as a
primary mission. (See Part II, Chapter 1, Section 4-2)

This chapter will explain Japan’s efforts at international peace cooperation activities undertaken by the

Defense Ministry and the SDF on such activities on the basis of the NDPG, and also their details. (See Fig.

**1. Proactive Efforts to Support International Peace Cooperation Activities on Japan’s Own**

**Initiative**

**1. History of Japan’s Efforts to Support International Peace Cooperation Activities**
The Persian Gulf War became a major turning point for prompting Japan to recognize the need to promote
international cooperation on the military front. The SDF dispatched a minesweeping unit of the Maritime
Self-Defense Force (MSDF) to the Persian Gulf in 1991 to ensure the safe passage of Japanese vessels. For
Japan, this dispatch meant, an international contribution on the human front with the purpose of peaceful and
humanitarian support for the reconstruction of devastated, and war-affected countries. In 1992, the International
Peace Cooperation Law[1] was enacted and Japan subsequently dispatched Ground Self-Defense Force (GSDF)
personnel to Cambodia in September of the same year as the country’s first participation in U.N. peacekeeping
operations. Since then, the Defense Ministry and the SDF have proactively and on its own initiative participated in
various international peace cooperation activities in an effort to improve the international security environment.

The September 11, 2001 attacks on the United States led to the enactment of the Anti-Terrorism Special

Measures Law[2], and the succeeding law, the Replenishment Support Special Measures Law[3], was enacted in
January 2008. The MSDF has been conducting refueling operations in the Indian Ocean on the basis of these laws.
Moreover, in 2003, Japan enacted the Law Concerning Special Measures on Humanitarian and Reconstruction
Assistance in Iraq[4]. As a result, the GSDF provided medical care, water supply and assistance for the recovery and
improvement of public infrastructure such as schools and roads. At present, the Air Self-Defense Force (ASDF)
transports supplies for humanitarian and reconstruction assistance from its base in Kuwait. (See Fig. III-3-1-2)

**2. Systems to Effectively Undertake International Peace Cooperation Activities**
In order to undertake international peace cooperation activities proactively and on its own initiative, the SDF
must continue establishing various systems. In March 2008, the GSDF established the Central Readiness Force
Regiment under the Central Readiness Force, so that
Japan can quickly and appropriately dispatch the
Central Readiness Regiment for international peace
cooperation activities as an advance unit to carry out
operations smoothly on the ground. In addition, the
SDF designates regional armies whose personnel are to
be dispatched on a rotational basis, and will continue
to improve defense equipment and transport capacity
so as to bolster the system for quick and appropriate
responses in international peace cooperation activities.
Moreover, the so-called “general law” for international
peace cooperation, which is currently the subject of
active debate, is thought to become a very important Former Parliamentary Secretary for Defense Akimoto gives instructions for the

dispatch of the MSDF vessel Oumi

**3. Welfare and Mental Health Care of Dispatched SDF Personnel**
It is extremely important to make preparations so that the dispatched SDF personnel, who are expected to fulfill
their assigned duty under severe working conditions while being far away from their home country and their
families, can effectively fulfill such duty while maintaining both their physical and mental health.

The Defense Ministry and the SDF have taken various measures to ease away deep anxiety of SDF members

being dispatched overseas for participation in international peace cooperation activities and of their families in

Japan so that the members can devote themselves to undertaking assigned duties without worry.

For example, welfare services are provided for the dispatched SDF members to help them maintain close

bonds with their families in Japan. Specifically, direct communication between the dispatched SDF members and
their families in Japan is ensured via international phone calls, TV telephones, e-mail and other services, and the
SDF members and their families can exchange video correspondence. Moreover, briefing sessions for families of
the dispatched members have been held to provide them with necessary information, and family support centers
and family counseling rooms have been established to respond to various questions raised by the families.

The SDF also offers mental healthcare services such as a course on stress reduction methods for SDF members

scheduled to be dispatched overseas. Moreover, engaging in overseas missions, dispatched SDF members can
consult other SDF members who have been designated as counselors after undergoing specialized training. Such
counselors provide the dispatched members with sufficient mental care. In addition, medical officers accompany
the SDF units engaged in overseas missions. The Defense Ministry is prepared to send qualified psychiatrists
from Japan or return sickened personnel for full treatment if necessary.

**2. Cooperation in Global Efforts to Reconstruct Iraq**

**1. Details and Significance of Japan’s Efforts to Support Iraqi Reconstruction**
Major combat operations have ended in Iraq, and the international community is redoubling its efforts to help
rebuild the country, following the adoption of the U.N. Security Council Resolution 1483[5] and subsequent
resolutions since May 2003. The reconstruction of Iraq is extremely important for ensuring peace and security
in the international community including Japan, as well as for attaining peace and security for the Iraqi people
and the Middle East. Japan began dispatching SDF units to the Middle East in December 2003 based on the
Law Concerning Special Measures on Humanitarian and Reconstruction Assistance in Iraq, approved in the Diet

**(Currently 21st Air Squadron)**

I was stationed on board the destroyer _Murasame as an SH-60K patrol helicopter pilot and engaged in_
replenishment activities in the Indian Ocean.

The main missions of helicopters engaging in replenishment activities were reconnaissance of oilers’

courses and surveillance of ships. This was a flight in actual operation where we prepared for contingencies
by loading ourselves with unusual equipment, carrying live rounds, wearing bullet-proof vests, and installing
bullet-proof seats, etc. Under the scorching sun, the temperature inside the aircraft rose to well over 40ºC,
and we had to periodically hydrate ourselves to prevent heat stroke. An unthinkable precaution in Japan had
been necessary. Furthermore, I was extremely sensitive due to the adverse effects on the aircraft’s devices as
a result of sandstorms, high temperatures and humidity, which occurred every two or three days.

It was my first deployment to the Indian Ocean, therefore I encountered various hardships because

of the unfamiliar surroundings. However, during the first support activities when we supplied fuel to the
Pakistani Marines’ vessel, they were very pleased at the resumption of MSDF support activities, displaying
the national flag of Japan and playing the national anthem of Japan “Kimi ga yo” in the background. This
appreciation humbled me and made me truly aware of the contribution of our activities to international peace
cooperation efforts. At the moment, I also realized that working as a member of the international community
along with other cooperating countries is also for Japan’s own benefit.

in July of the same year. The dispatched SDF units have conducted operations for humanitarian assistance in
cooperation with support provided by Official Development Assistance.

The SDF units have also been assisting troops of foreign countries in their efforts to restore security and stability

in Iraq to the degree that would not hamper the units’ humanitarian and reconstruction assistance activities.

Japan’s cooperation activities play a vital role in preventing Iraq from becoming a hotbed of terrorism and

helping the country to rebuild itself so that it can become a peaceful, democratic and responsible country, paving
the foundation for Japan and Iraq to establish favorable relations in the future. They are not only instrumental in
stabilizing the overall Middle East but also are extremely important for Japan because the situation in the Middle

East region directly affects the prosperity and stability
of Japan, which relies on the region for nearly 90% of
its petroleum.

Japan’s humanitarian contribution to the activities

along with the U.S. for the reconstruction of Iraq has
further cemented the relationship of mutual confidence
between Japan and the U.S., helping to strengthen their
bilateral security alliance.

Japan’s support to help rebuild Iraq has garnered

acclaim both from the international community and
the Iraqi people. It plays a significant role in not only

Personnel see out aircraft leaving for humanitarian and reconstruction assistance achieving closer and more effective security cooperation
in Iraq between Japan and the U.S., but also enhancing trust in

Japan by the international community.

**2. Outline of the Law Concerning Special Measures on Humanitarian and Reconstruction**

**Assistance in Iraq and the Basic Plan**

**(1) Outline of the Law Concerning Special Measures on Humanitarian and Reconstruction**

**Assistance in Iraq**

Japan believes that it is important to ensure that the results of its reconstruction assistance are firmly rooted and
to work toward building a broad, long-term partnership with Iraq. The Law Concerning Special Measures on
Humanitarian and Reconstruction Assistance in Iraq, or the Iraq Special Measures Law, is intended to allow Japan
to implement activities for humanitarian and reconstruction assistance and support activities for ensuring security
in line with U.N. Security Council Resolution 1483 and others. It is also designed for Japan to proactively and
voluntarily contribute to global efforts for the reconstruction of Iraq in order to promote the peace and security
of the international community, including Japan.

In light of the continued assistance to Iraq offered by the U.N. and the multinational force, such as the adoption

in November 2006 of the U.N. Security Council Resolution 1723 extending the authority of the multinational
force for one year at the request of the Iraqi Government, Japan decided in June 2007 to extend the effective term
of the Iraq Special Measures Law by two years to July 31, 2009. (See Fig. III-3-1-3)

**(2) Outline of the Basic Plan**
The Basic Plan stipulated basic policies, the range of aid activities, their contents, the scope of areas where
such activities are undertaken, and other matters regarding response measures Japan is to take in line with the
Law Concerning Special Measures on Humanitarian and Reconstruction Assistance in Iraq. The Government
deemed it necessary for Japan to conduct activities commensurate to its international status in order to fulfill


-----

its responsibility in the international community, and the Cabinet approved the Basic Plan in December 2003.
Initially, the Basic Plan stipulated the dispatch of SDF troops to Iraq for up to one year, but acting on an
independent assessment based on the Iraqi situation, Japan revised the Basic Plan a total of 10 times in order to
extend the duration of the SDF’s humanitarian assistance activities in Iraq, to withdraw GSDF units from the
country and to enable the ASDF to engage in missions in support of U.N. operations. (See Reference 44) (See
Fig. III-3-1-4)

**Fig. III-3-1-3 Contents of Activities Based on the Law Concerning Special Measures on Humanitarian and**

**3. SDF Operations**
Since December 2003, the SDF, based on the Law Concerning Special Measures on Humanitarian and
Reconstruction Assistance in Iraq, has provided humanitarian and reconstruction support to the country such as
medical care, water supply, restoration and improvement of public infrastructure such as schools and roads, and
transportation of personnel and aid materials for the local people facing hardship. In June 2006, the Government
of Japan concluded that Iraq was capable of carrying out reconstruction independently by its own people, and
thus ended the GSDF operations, which had lasted for about two and a half years in Al-Muthanna Province. (See
Reference 46-47)

Meanwhile, an ASDF squadron continues to assist in the reconstruction and stabilization of Iraq, providing

airlift support to the U.N. as requested by the U.N. Secretary-General as well as to the multinational force. As
of July 2, 2008, the number of airlifting operations by the ASDF for the Iraqi mission totaled 729 times, which
transported 603.6 tons of goods and materials. The SDF personnel contribution and the Government’s Official
Development Assistance (ODA) under the jurisdiction of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs have been carried out
in tandem, and such efforts to support Iraq, having produced visible results, have garnered high acclaim from the
international community, including Iraq.

In addition, the SDF has dispatched liaison and other officers[6] to the U.S. Central Command in the state of

Florida and to the multinational force headquarters in Baghdad to gather information necessary for SDF operations
being undertaken based on the Law Concerning Special Measures on Humanitarian and Reconstruction Assistance
in Iraq and to make various coordination with the U.S. Central Command and the multinational force.

**4. Evaluation of Japan’s Efforts by Other Countries**
Japan’s activities for the reconstruction of Iraq have garnered acclaim and gratitude from Iraq and other countries,
as mentioned below. A public opinion poll conducted by the Samawah local newspaper Uruku and the Asahi
Shimbun of Japan showed that about 70% of respondents supported the Japanese operations. (As of August
2006)

**(1) Evaluation in Iraq**
In his letter addressed to then Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe on March 12, 2007, Iraqi Prime Minister Nuri
al-Maliki said airlifting activities by Japan’s ASDF for the U.N. and the multinational force have been playing a
major and vital role in Iraq’s efforts to promote reconstruction and nation rebuilding. In the letter, the Iraqi Prime
Minister also requested Japan to consider renewing its support activities in Iraq. During his visit to Japan in April
2007, Prime Minister al-Maliki commended the ASDF’s airlifting activities as what encourages the Iraqi people
and expressed gratitude for Japan’s contribution to rebuilding Iraq.

**(2) Evaluation by the United Nations**
In a letter delivered to then Prime Minister Abe in March 2007, U.N. Secretary-General Ban Ki-Moon expressed
gratitude for Japan’s airlifting operations, saying that the airlift service has been of particular importance in
supporting UNAMI’s Area Office in Erbil.

In March 2007, Ashraf Qazi, the Secretary-General’s Special Representative in Iraq, expressed appreciation

for the ASDF’s airlift operations and asked for Japan’s continued engagement in a letter to the Japanese Acting
Ambassador to Iraq.

**(3) Evaluation by Other Countries**
U.S. President George W. Bush thanked then Japanese Prime Minister Junichiro Koizumi during their summit
meeting in June 2006 for Japan’s humanitarian reconstruction assistance efforts in Iraq and Afghanistan, and for


-----

Japan’s support to the multinational force operations in the Indian Ocean.

Prior to that, U.S. Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice visited Japan in July 2004 and highly commended

Japan for its contribution to rebuilding Iraq and Afghanistan. Rice also stated that Japan’s assistance in Iraq has
greatly helped the Iraqi people.

Furthermore, during the Japan-U.S. Defense Chiefs’ Meeting in January 2006 between then U.S. Defense

Secretary Donald Rumsfeld and then Japanese Minister of State for Defense Fukushiro Nukaga, Rumsfeld highly
appreciated Japan’s past efforts in Iraq. Saudi Arabian Crown Prince Sultan Bin Abdul Aziz, who also serves
as Inspector General and Minister of Defense and Aviation, meeting with then Prime Minister Koizumi in April
2006, expressed his high evaluation of Japan’s efforts to reconstruct and stabilize Iraq and his gratitude for its
contribution in the country.

The proud and fulfilled faces of SDF members who returned to
Japan from overseas missions impressed me, and I thought “I
want to do something, too,” so I applied for it.

As Medical Squadron Leader, I was in charge of the

health management, including medical treatment of Squadron
members. In addition to the treatment (medical and dental),
the Medical Squadron was responsible for medical exams and
Squadron member training, such as lifesaving methods and
mental healthcare. We also maintained readiness to respond
to emergency situations and critical patients. Nevertheless,

Lieutenant Colonel Sakauchi conducting a dental examination

we were busy every day, and I think this four-month tour was
physically and mentally hard particularly for the sole medical officer (Medical Squadron Assistant Leader)
in charge of medical treatment.

In Iraq, we were able to actively participate in rescue drills with U.S. military medical corps. It was

valuable experience to be involved in training to deal with unexpected situations with other countries that
we are rarely able to do in Japan. Although there were some communication barriers with the U.S. Air Force
medical team, thanks to the face-to-face training, I think we were able to build a strong relationship. As a
result, when a critical patient arose, we received prompt cooperation for examination and transportation.

I feel proud to have served in such international peace cooperation activities. What’s more, I am very

grateful to my subordinates who assisted with administrative duties during my absence, and for the support
of my wife and relatives who promptly responded when I resolved to volunteer for such overseas duty.

Ali Al Salem Air Base in Kuwait, where I am stationed, is
surrounded by desert as far as I can see. This was a totally
different world from anything I had experienced: a wasteland
where sandstorms dance, a dry climate and strong sunlight, and
a wide range of temperature that can vary about 40ºC between
midday and night.

I was posted here voluntarily of course. My reason for

volunteering is that I wanted to fulfill my duty to contribute to
the reconstruction of Iraq and stability in the Middle East as a
member of the international community.

I make maintenance plans, allocate work to each maintenance technician, and maintain and manage the
operational state of each plane.

I am greatly satisfied when the blue-gray C-130H planes that other colleagues and I maintain safely

finish their flight assignment, and in the moment when they return to the base, I am filled with relief as I say
to the plane, “You flew well again today!”

After the plane lands, I immediately tackle the maintenance for the next day’s assignment and it is a daily

occurrence that the darkness of night creeps up on me without notice. Maintenance operations in Kuwait
lack sufficient tools and maintenance equipment, but maintenance staffs make up for the inadequacies of the
situation by overcoming problems with “guts” and “ingenuity” to send off our beloved planes daily into the
skies over Iraq. I want to further refine my skills as maintenance personnel and fulfill our duties involving
international peace cooperation activities with complete preparedness.

**3. Activities Responding to International Terrorism**

**1. Efforts of International Community**
Since the September 11, 2001 terrorist attacks on the United States, the international community has been fighting
terrorism not only on the military front but also on diplomatic, police, judicial, intelligence and economic fronts.
However, the threat of terrorist attacks prevails in the international community in light of the outbreak of a
series of suspected terrorist acts[7] in various parts of the world by international terrorist organizations including
Al Qaeda. Due to these circumstances, it is imperative that the international community continues the long-term
effort in a consolidated manner in order to fully eradicate terrorism.

Strongholds of terrorist groups like Al Qaeda are believed to exist along the national border between Afghanistan

and Pakistan. As Afghanistan continues to serve as a production center for narcotics, a source of major funding for
terrorist activities, the U.S. military and others have been conducting mopping-up operations against forces of Al
Qaeda and the Taliban in the region under Operation Enduring Freedom (OEF). (See Fig. III-3-1-5)

A number of countries have dispatched troops to Afghanistan (as of May 2008) to take part in the U.S.-led operation

in an attempt to stamp out terrorists in the region. But some groups with suspected links to terrorist organizations who
are believed to be involved in narcotics and weapons trafficking may have escaped from the region via mountainous

areas and moved to the sea. These groups are believed to have already moved by sea to wider areas like the Middle
East, Africa, Europe or Southeast Asia and may be engaging in terrorist activities in those regions.

The international community has been engaged in maritime interdiction operations in the Indian Ocean in

order to block and deter the movement of terrorists, weapons, ammunition and narcotics – a major funding source
for terrorism. At present, U.S., European, Pakistani, and other countries’ warships are operating in this area.
These activities such as making radio inquiries and conducting on-the-spot inspections of suspicious boats have
already achieved accomplishments such as detecting and confiscating a large amount of narcotics, firearms, and
portable anti-tank rockets.

In addition, the International Security Assistance Force (ISAF) has been trying to maintain security in

Afghanistan and rebuild[8] the country, reflecting the determination by the international community to prevent it
from reverting to a hotbed of terrorism.

**2. Japan’s Efforts in the Fight Against Terrorism**
At a time when the international community stands united in the fight against terrorism, it is necessary for Japan
to reinforce its efforts to combat terrorism in collaboration with other countries as well. Based on this concept,
Japan is making anti-terrorism efforts[9] on various fronts.

For example, the replenishment activities conducted by the MSDF in the Indian Ocean have become an

important basis for vessels of other countries to conduct MIOs in these waters, and have earned high acclaim from
the international community. In addition to the U.S., U.K., France and Germany, Pakistan, which is an Islamic
country, is participating in the MIOs. In the U.N. Security Council Resolution 1776 adopted in September 2007,
praise for Operation Enduring Freedom including MIOs was expressed as contributions to many countries.

Since December 2001, Japan has conducted replenishment activities such as refueling and water supplying

to vessels of various nations. Due to these replenishment activities, it has become possible for vessels of all


-----

MIO-participating countries to continue activities in the
open waters without returning to the port for refueling.
In addition, replenishment activities at sea are less
likely to be targeted by terrorists than those at ports.
Furthermore, replenishment activities at sea require the
refueling vessel to position itself parallel to the vessel
being refueled, which requires a high level of skill and
capability. Only few other countries besides Japan can
stably conduct such replenishment activities at sea for
a long time. Thus, such activities by the MSDF can be
regarded as a highly appropriate contribution by Japan.

Pakistani vessel receiving refueling support from MSDF vessel in the Indian

Moreover, these activities by the MSDF contribute to Ocean
the peace and security of the area, and serve Japan’s
national interest as a country that depends on the Middle East for many resources.

The replenishment activities that have been conducted for six years by the MSDF based on the former

Anti-Terrorism Special Measures Law, have earned high appraisals from various countries. Although the
continuation of these replenishment activities had been desired, it was suspended due to the expiration of the Law
mentioned above in November 2007. However, from the aforementioned perspective, after the establishment of
the Replenishment Support Special Measures Law by the Diet in January 2008, the Ministry of Defense and the
SDF have promptly dispatched the MSDF vessels to the Indian Ocean, and resumed replenishment activities
from February.

**3. Outline of the Replenishment Support Special Measures Law and Implementation Plan**

**(1) Purpose**
The Law aims to contribute to securing the peace and security in the international community including Japan,
through Japan’s continued contribution to assist efforts by the international community proactively and on its
own initiative in order to prevent and eradicate international terrorism, through replenishment support activities[10]
for the multinational forces participating in the Operation Enduring Freedom–Maritime Interdiction Operation
(OEF-MIO)[11].
1) The U.N. Security Council Resolution 1776[12] expresses its appreciation for contributions by the international

community to prevent and eradicate international terrorism which Japan has also contributed through
replenishment and other support operations by the Maritime Self-Defense Force to the foreign naval vessels
taking part in OEF-MIO under the former Anti-Terrorism Special Measures Law;
2) Due to the current situation where the continued threats of the September 11, 2001 terrorist attacks still exist,

the Security Council resolutions such as 1368 and 1373 request all U.N. member nations to take appropriate
measures to prevent and eradicate international terrorist acts. In response to this request, the international
community has continued its efforts to prevent and eradicate international terrorism, which includes efforts by
the armed forces and other entities to eliminate terrorist threats to help achieve the goals of the U.N. Charter;
3) Given the fact that the Security Council Resolution 1776 emphasizes the necessity for continuous

implementation of such operations, this Law aims to contribute to securing the peace and security in the
international community including Japan, through Japan’s continued contribution to assist efforts by the
international community proactively and on its own initiative in order to prevent and eradicate international
terrorism, through replenishment support activities for the multinational forces participating in the Operation
Enduring Freedom-Maritime Interdiction Operation (OEF-MIO).


-----

**(2) Basic Principles**
**a. The Government will proactively contribute to efforts by the international community to prevent and eradicate**

international terrorism by conducting replenishment support activities appropriately and promptly, and thereby
work to secure the peace and security of the international community, including Japan.

**b. Replenishment support activities shall not be conducted with threat of military force or exertion of military**

force.

**c. Replenishment support activities will be conducted in the following areas:**
(i) The territory of Japan
(ii) Areas specified below where it is recognized that acts of war[13] are not currently being conducted and that

acts of war will not be conducted for the duration in which these activities are performed:

[A] International waters (limited to the Indian Ocean [including the Persian Gulf, the same to apply

hereinafter] and waters traversed in passage between the territory of Japan and the Indian Ocean) and
their airspace

[B] The territories of foreign countries (limited to the Indian Ocean, countries along its coast, and countries

with ports-of-call made by ships during passage between the territory of Japan and countries along the
coast of the Indian Ocean) (only with consent of these foreign countries)

**d. The Prime Minister, representing the Cabinet, will direct administrative departments in accordance with the**

implementation plan when conducting replenishment support activities.

**e. The heads of relevant administrative agencies will cooperate with the Defense Minister concerning the**

implementation of replenishment support activities.

**(3) Implementation Plan**
**a. The Prime Minister must request the Cabinet in advance to approve the proposal of the implementation plan**

on replenishment support activities (hereinafter referred to as “implementation plan”).

**b. The matters to be stipulated by the implementation plan are as follows.**
(i) The basic plan concerning implementation of replenishment support activities
(ii) Matters concerning the designation of areas for implementation of replenishment support activities
(iii) The size of SDF units to implement replenishment support activities in the territory of a foreign country,

their composition, equipment and duration of dispatch
(iv) Important matters concerning the procurement of goods by the SDF to the armed forces of foreign

countries other than those to be provided or those which have been provided for use in said activities
(v) Matters concerning communication and coordination with relevant administrative agencies for

implementation of replenishment support activities
(vi) Other important matters concerning implementation of replenishment support activities

**(4) Relations to the Diet**
**a. Diet reports**
The Prime Minister must report the following matters to the Diet without delay.
(i) Details concerning decision or change of the implementation plan
(ii) Results following the conclusion of replenishment support activities

**b. Diet approval**

The Replenishment Support Special Measures Law: 1) limits the type and manner of operations to the
replenishment only, and 2) stipulates the implementation area including the range of foreign nations of
dispatch, consequently, the law does not establish the provisions concerning Diet approval, which is based on
the idea that if the law passes through Diet deliberations, the repeated requests for the Diet approval for the
implementation of the activities can be regarded as unnecessary.


-----

**(5) Use of Weapons**
**a. A Self-Defense Force member of SDF units who has been commanded to implement replenishment support**

activities may use weapons in a situation where there is sufficient reason to believe that the use of force is
unavoidable in order to protect the life or safety of the member, or that of other SDF members present along
with the member at the site of operations, or that of persons under the member’s supervision when such
operations are carried out, to the extent determined reasonably as being necessary to respond to the situation.

**b. If a senior officer is present at the site of operations, the use of weapons must be authorized by order of the**

senior officer. This shall not apply, however, in situations where a violation or threat against life or safety is
imminent and there is insufficient time to obtain such order.

**c. A senior officer at the said site shall issue a necessary order so as to prevent threat to life or safety or to**

prevent confusion caused by the unregulated use of weapons in order to ensure that the use of such weapons
is conducted within the scope of the purpose of use in accordance with the provisions of this paragraph and
paragraph d., below.

**d. The use of weapons shall not cause injury to people except in cases of justifiable self-defense or emergency**

evacuation.

**(6) Term of Law**
This law will expire one year from the date of enforcement. However, the term may be extended by a period not
to exceed one year. (See Fig.III-3-1-6) (See Reference 48)

**4. Replenishment Support Activities by the Maritime Self-Defense Force**
In accordance with the Replenishment Support Special Measures Law, the MSDF dispatched the destroyer
_Murasame from Yokosuka Naval Base on January 24, 2008 and the replenishment ship_ _Oumi from Sasebo_
Naval Base on January 25 and resumed replenishment activities in the Indian Ocean on February 21. The MSDF
replenishment activities supplied fuel for vessels and helicopters on board vessels, and water to naval vessels
of nations participating in anti-terrorism maritime interdiction activities, and as of June 30, 2008, has supplied
vessels with fuel 32 times, helicopters on board vessels with fuel 7 times, and water 11 times.

Additionally, the MSDF conducted replenishment activities under the former Anti-Terrorism Special

Measures Laws a total of 794 times. (See Fig. III-3-1-7)

Furthermore, regarding replenishment activities, the following measures are taken to ensure that the fuel

supplied by Japan is appropriately used in line with the major principles of the Replenishment Support Special
Measures Law.

**(1) Conclusion of Exchange of Notes**
Japan has decided to conclude a new exchange of notes under the new law, following the former practice under
the Anti-Terrorism Special Measures Law[14].

By clearly rewriting the purpose of the Replenishment Support Special Measures Law on the exchange of

notes, it further clarifies that the replenishment such as refueling by the MSDF shall be conducted under the
purpose of the law. Moreover, it stipulates consultations between the Japanese government and the governments
involved for the effective implementation of the Law.

In addition, the conditions for replenishment were repeatedly explained to each country before signing the

exchange of notes, and were concluded with all countries accepting these conditions.


-----

**(2) Confirmation work by Liaison Officers in Bahrain**
MSDF liaison officers dispatched to the Bahraini Coalition Headquarters must confirm each time of supply,
whether the aforementioned vessels are following operations based on the counterterrorism Maritime Interdiction
Operation written on the Replenishment Support Special Measures Law, while comprehending the plans of
vessels to be supplied.

Additionally, in such events, the officers must make an entry of the following check points in a stylized

format: the date and time of replenishment, name and attached unit of vessels subject to supply, replenishment
amount, and future plans (documentation of follow-up procedures that have been conducted).

Also regarding the adequacy of replenishment implementation, the Minister of Defense will make the final

decision when it is difficult for the local unit to come to a decision.

**5. Evaluation of Japan’s Activities**
At a meeting with a member of the House of Representatives Special Committee on Anti-Terrorism Measures and
Iraq, in evaluating Japan’s activities to counter international terrorism President Hamid Karzai of Afghanistan
said that he believed that the operations of the MSDF fulfilled an essential role for the MIO activities as a
whole and that the replenishment activities performed by Japan were for the benefit of Japan, the international
community, and Afghanistan. In August 2007, then President Pervez Musharraf of Pakistan, in a meeting with
then Defense Minister Koike, said that Japan’s replenishment activities were essential for sustaining anti-terrorism
operations. In addition, in a telephone conversation with then Minister for Foreign Affairs Machimura in August
2007, the U.N. Secretary-General stressed the importance of continuing the fight against terrorism together with
the international community. The U.N. Secretary-General also praised the resumption of Japan’s replenishment
activities, saying that along with peacekeeping forces in Afghanistan, the replenishment activities significantly
help the Government of Afghanistan bring safety and development to its people.

**4. Efforts to Support U.N. Peacekeeping Operations (PKOs), etc.**
As a way to prevent recurrence of regional conflicts following a cease-fire agreement, the U.N. sponsors
peacekeeping operations such as cease-fire monitoring, election monitoring, and reconstruction assistance. As of
the end of May, 2008, U.N. peacekeeping operations are underway in 17 locations around the world. (See Fig.
I-2-9-1)

In addition, international organizations such as the UNHCR and individual countries engage in relief and

reconstruction activities for the victims of conflicts and
large-scale disasters from a humanitarian perspective or
from the viewpoint of stabilizing the domestic situations
of affected countries.

Japan, in a bid to fulfill a role commensurate to its

international status, has been cooperating both in terms
of funding and personnel, with global efforts being led
by the U.N. to build a peaceful and stable international
community.

In order to help improve the international security

environment, the Defense Ministry and the SDF have
actively engaged in international peace cooperation Commander of the Golan Heights transport unit receives the unit flag from the

-----

**1. Outline of International Peace Cooperation Law, etc.**
The International Peace Cooperation Law, enacted in June 1992, is designed to contribute further to global
efforts being led by the U.N. to achieve peace in the international community by upgrading Japan’s framework
for cooperating appropriately and quickly in 1) U.N. peacekeeping activities[15], 2) humanitarian support for
international relief and rescue opeations[16] and 3) international election monitoring activities.

The law stipulates a set of basic guidelines (the so-called five principles for participation) for Japan’s

participation in a U.N. peacekeeping force (PKF).

Japan had suspended the SDF’s participation in PKF’s so-called core operations[17]. Meanwhile, Japan provided

logistical support to PKF missions, and steadily accumulated achievements and experience in the area. Due to
expectations both at home and abroad for further participation in international peace cooperation activities, Japan
amended the International Peace Cooperation Law in December 2001. The amendment lifted the ban on the
SDF’s participation in core PKF operations. (See Fig. III-3-1-8, 9)

**Fig. III-3-1-8 Basic Policy on Japan’s Participation in U.N. Peacekeeping Forces (Five Principles)**

1. Warring parties must reach a ceasefire accord
2. Warring parties, including those from the countries in which the U.N. peacekeeping force are to operate, must

consent to the U.N. force’s operations and Japan’s participation in the operations of the U.N. force

3. The U.N. peacekeeping force must take a neutral stance; they should not side with any particular warring party
4. Japan must ensure that the SDF can withdraw from operations of the U.N. peacekeeping force if either one of the

three principles stated above is not met

5. The use of weapons by SDF members participating in operations of the U.N. peacekeeping force should be limited as

much as possible to situations that are conceivably necessary to protect the members’ lives

**2. United Nations Mission in Nepal (UNMIN)**

**(1) Background of Japan’s Decision to Send Personnel to UNMIN**
Despite the ongoing civil war between the Nepalese Government and the Maoists (Communist Party of Nepal)
in a bid to capture power, an accord aimed at achieving permanent peace was signed in November 2006 thanks to
repeated peace negotiations under the new government established in May 2006. Subsequently, a comprehensive
peace agreement was reached, marking the end of conflict.

In response to a request from the Nepalese Government and a recommendation by the Secretary-General of

United Nations, UNMIN was established[18] on January 24, 2007 through U.N. Security Council Resolution 1740.
UNMIN activities were then extended until January 23, 2009, in response to the Nepalese constituent assembly
election in April 2008 and the request by the Nepalese Government in July 2008.

Situated between China and India, Nepal occupies an important strategic position, and its stability is crucial

to the security of the surrounding region as a whole. With the noble efforts being made toward the peace and
stability of Nepal, it is important for Japan, as a member of Asia, to make personnel contribution to the mission.
On March 27, 2007, Japan’s Cabinet, in response to a request by the U.N. for the dispatch of military-monitoring
personnel to UNMIN operations, decided to dispatch personnel to the mission, and since March 30, 2007, six
GSDF officers have been posted at UNMIN. In addition, the Defense Ministry and the International Peace
Cooperation Headquarters of the Cabinet Office respectively dispatched two liaison personnel for the purpose of
communication, coordination and information collection with local agencies concerned. Furthermore, in March
2008, the second dispatch of a military-monitoring team consisting of six members replaced the first dispatch of
personnel to continue military-monitoring duties. (See Fig. III-3-1-10)

**(2) Activities of GSDF Officers at UNMIN**
GSDF officers are being dispatched to seven Maoist camps and barracks of the Nepalese military for the
management of arms and soldiers.

The GSDF officers dispatched to UNMIN do not carry weapons in line with the provisions of the U.N. The

officers, dispatched on an individual basis, have been working as military-monitoring personnel and command
personnel, which is different from the past personnel dispatch by Japan for the support of U.N. peacekeeping
operations where SDF officers were dispatched both as military-monitoring personnel and personnel posted
for the assignment at peacekeeping headquarters. Through their activities, GSDF officers have earned high
acclaim from UNMIN military-monitoring personnel of the U.N. and participating nations for their discipline,
professionalism, leadership and sincere approach to their work.

**3. International Peace Cooperation Activities in the Golan Heights**

**(1) Background to Japan’s Decision to Send Troops to UNDOF**
The U.N. Disengagement Observer Force (UNDOF) has been undertaking peacekeeping operations in a zone
called the Area of Separation (AOS), set up between the opposing troops of Syria and Israel based on a ceasefire
agreement. UNDOF’s mission is to monitor the ceasefire between the two countries and the implementation of
measures stipulated under an agreement between the countries over the separation of their opposing troops. The
SDF has been providing logistical support for UNDOF operations. (See Fig. III-3-1-11,12)

Japan’s participation in the UNDOF operations is significant because it marks Japan’s personnel contribution

to the international efforts to achieve peace in the Middle East. The participation is also significant for Japan
because it cultivates human resources with skills relevant to international peace cooperation activities.

The Government of Japan decided in December 1995 to dispatch SDF units and other personnel to the

UNDOF. In February 1996, the first transport unit of 43 personnel was sent to the Golan Heights and replaced
a Canadian transport unit. Since then, an SDF unit has been dispatched approximately every six months on a
rotating basis. However, the system has changed to involve only the rotation of personnel while maintaining
troops and the Golan Heights Transport Unit was newly organized in February 2008. As of the end of May 2008,
the 25th dispatch of personnel was sent to the Golan Heights.

**Voice of SDF Personnel Working for the United Nations Mission in Nepal (UNMIN)**

**Colonel Katsunobu Ishibashi**

**Leader of Nepal International Peace Cooperation Team (Primary Staff Member)**

**Assigned to Central Readiness Force HQ (Currently assigned to the Ground Staff College)**

From March 31, 2007, six SDF personnel selected
from all parts of Japan took part in the United
Nations Mission in Nepal (UNMIN) for one year as
military-monitoring personnel, joining other militarymonitoring personnel from 80 countries and Nepalese
colleagues in engaging in monitoring of arms and
military personnel management.

The major activities that we took part in were to

visit the Maoist army camps and the Nepalese Army
barracks for the purpose of monitoring the storage of
arms and their activities on both sides. On the occasion Colonel Ishibashi making adjustments with UNMIN staff from different

countries (second from left)

of monitoring of the Maoist army, we stayed in the
Maoist camp with three to five military-monitoring personnel from other countries together with a Nepalese
interpreter. At the start of our activities we did not have proper accommodation or working facilities. We
often worked in temperatures exceeding 40˚C, and were plagued by mosquitoes in our tents. Gradually
prefabricated facilities were constructed, and although it was not ideal, an environment was improved so
that we could bear to remain there and work for one or two weeks. However, the most difficult aspect of the
assignment was living together with colleagues who had been brought up in a different environment and
who had different religions and values from ours. For example, personnel from the region on the equator
and those from near the North Pole had completely different reactions to the heat, and some personnel
could not share the same meals for religious reasons. Regarding work procedures, some people work
systemically according to a plan; others do not have a plan and respond to the situation on the scene. The
military-monitoring personnel work sensibly as representatives of their respective countries as well as the
U.N., but at times we have some misunderstandings and I was under a lot of stress because of such various
interpersonal relationships in addition to the severe living conditions. However, the Japanese characteristics
of modesty and harmony contributed to creating a good atmosphere in the team. In addition, given our sense
of duty in our mission, our adherence to time and the work performance skills we have acquired in the SDF,
our activities were highly praised within UNMIN, and we played a leading role in operations on the scene.

I believe that our activities were significant in the sense that Japan should fulfill its obligations to

the international community in the field. In addition, I think that we were able to make a contribution to
demonstrating the excellence of Japanese people to Nepal and to the world.

Note: “Maoist” is the common term used to refer to the Maoist group of the Nepalese Communist Party.

**(2) SDF Operations**
The dispatched SDF transport unit is in charge of transporting daily goods and materials needed for UNDOF
operations from the harbors, airports and commodities markets of Israel, Syria and Lebanon to the UNDOF
camps. The unit also provides logistical support, including repairs of roads which have become slippery due to
rain and snowfall, and removal of snow from streets in plateau areas with an altitude of more than 2,800 meters.
The transport unit stayed at the same camp as Indian forces, which replaced Canadian forces in March 2006.
Members of the SDF and Indian forces jointly provide meals and other services to troops.

The ASDF flies a C-130H transport plane and a U-4 multipurpose assistance plane to the Golan Heights

every six months to transport goods and materials for the transport unit.

Two SDF officers being sent to the UNDOF headquarters overseas are in charge of planning and coordination

of transport and other UNDOF logistic support operations, and are also responsible for publicity and budgetrelated works. SDF officers are assigned to the UNDOF headquarters for about one year, and are replaced by
other SDF personnel after completing their assignment. SDF personnel working at the UNDOF headquarters as
of the end of May 2008 are in the 13th dispatch.

Japan had initially intended to complete its participation in UNDOF operations within two years. However,

participation has continued until now after taking into consideration various factors, such as strong requests from
the U.N., high evaluation of past Japanese operations by the U.N. and relevant countries, and the importance of
Japan’s personnel contribution to peace in the Middle East. Japan’s contribution to UNDOF has been deepened
with the SDF dispatch of the Golan Heights Transport Unit totaling up to 25 times, with approximately 1,100
personnel.

The experience the SDF has accumulated through the mission has contributed to creating a foundation for

participation in other U.N. peacekeeping operations and activities to support the reconstruction of Iraq.

**4. The United Nations Mission in Sudan (UNMIS)**
In Sudan, the Sudanese Government and the Sudan People’s Liberation Movement signed the Comprehensive
Peace Agreement (CPA) in January 2005. Based upon this agreement, the United Nations Mission in Sudan
(UNMIS) was formed to support the execution of the CPA and to perform ceasefire surveillance etc. In addition
to the military section that performs ceasefire surveillance etc., the UNMIS has the civilian section in charge
of election support and humanitarian assistance coordination. UNMIS is a multi-functional, large-scale U.N.
peacekeeping operation that involves approximately 10,000 people.

During the joint press conference after the meeting with U.N. Secretary-General Ban Ki-Moon in June 2008,

Prime Minister Fukuda announced the dispatch of SDF personnel to UNMIS headquarters personnel. Preparation
for the dispatch are being arranged within the government.

**5. Dispatch of SDF officers to the U.N. Department of Peacekeeping Operations**
In 2000, the U.N. established the Panel on U.N. Peace Operations[20] to review all issues associated with peace
operations including U.N. peacekeeping operations. The U.N. expanded the number of officials in the Department
of Peacekeeping Operations (PKO Department) in response to recommendations by the panel, as a means of
reinforcing the peacekeeping function of the U.N. headquarters.

In November 2001, the Law on Working Conditions of Defense Agency Officials Dispatched to International

Organizations (then) (1995 Law No. 122; hereinafter referred to as the “Dispatched Defense Agency Personnel
Working Conditions Law”) was revised to enable the (then) Defense Agency to send its personnel to the PKO
Department. The revision was based on the judgment that the agency’s dispatch of personnel to the U.N.
department would contribute to supporting the U.N. in its efforts toward achieving world peace. Under the
revised law, one GSDF officer was dispatched in December 2002 to the Military Planning Section of the Military


-----

Division in the PKO Department of the United Nations, which is located in the U.S. The dispatched GSDF officer
has been participating in various PKO works including development of policies and plans.

**5. International Disaster Relief Operations**
The Ministry of Defense and the SDF are determined to step up international disaster relief operations from the
viewpoint of humanitarian contributions and improvement of the international security environment.

In addition, the GSDF, the MSDF and the ASDF maintain their readiness to take any necessary action

based on prepared disaster relief operation plans, whenever a situation in which their operations are deemed
necessary arises. The SDF has dispatched its units overseas for international disaster relief operations while
closely examining specific relief requests filed by governments of affected countries and disaster situations in
these countries. The Ministry of Defense and the SDF have been proactively conducting international disaster
relief operations fully utilizing the capabilities of the GSDF, the MSDF and the ASDF. (See Fig. III-3-1-13) (See
Reference 49)

**1. Outline of the Law Concerning the Dispatch of International Disaster Relief Teams**
Since the Law Concerning the Dispatch of International Disaster Relief Teams (1987 Law No. 93; hereinafter
referred to as “the International Disaster Relief Law”) was enacted in 1987, Japan has engaged in international
disaster relief activities in response to requests from the governments of affected countries and international
organizations.

In 1992, the International Disaster Relief Law was amended to enable the SDF to participate in international

disaster relief operations and to transport its personnel and equipment. Since then, the SDF has maintained its
readiness for international disaster relief operations with self-sufficient capabilities, including relief operations


-----

and medical treatment, and with the use of its own equipment, organizations and the benefits of regular training,
even when local support is not available for transport, accommodation, food and water supplies, communication,
sanitation and so forth.

**2. International Disaster Relief Operations by the SDF and the SDF’s Posture**
International disaster relief operations conducted by the SDF may take different forms according to factors such
as the scale of the disaster, the degree of damage, and the requests of the governments of affected countries or
international organizations. In the major earthquake that struck the central region of Java, Indonesia in May
2006, the SDF, acting on a request from the Indonesian Government, provided medical assistance in the affected
area, examining a total of about 3,800 persons while vaccinating about 1,700 persons and controlling infections
diseases over an area of 4,300m[2]. Judging from the past experience of SDF dispatched to various disaster sites
in Japan, the SDF’s capabilities in international disaster relief operations encompass 1) medical services, such as
first-aid medical treatment and epidemic prevention, 2) transport of goods, patients, and disaster relief personnel
by helicopter, and 3) ensuring water supplies using water-purifying devices. Also, the SDF uses transport planes
and transport ships to carry disaster relief personnel and equipment to the affected area.

Central Readiness Force and regional units of the GSDF are assigned duties on a six-month rotational basis

to ensure that they can provide medical, transport and water-supply services in an independent manner anytime
the need for disaster relief arises.

In addition, the MSDF and the ASDF maintains its readiness to dispatch fleet and air-support units,

respectively, to transport supplies to units participating in international disaster relief operations, including their
own, as the need for disaster relief arises.

**Department of Logistics, Ground Staff Office**

**(Currently assigned to the Comptroller Department)**

From December 3-7, 2007, the Department of Logistics,
Ground Staff Office hosted the Multilateral Logistics
Staff Talks (MLST) at Ichigaya Base and other sites.
The MLST was the largest such event yet held, with 10
logistics staff from nine countries in the Asia-Pacific
region (representatives from the U.S. Army and
Marines attended), including first-time participants
India and Indonesia, and representatives from the
GSDF (Central Readiness Force, Ground Research
and Development Command, Ground Material Control

Lieutenant Colonel Hamamatsu explaining the overview during a meeting

Command, Staff College, and Kodaira School) as well
as from the Joint Staff. This was the 11th of its kind
held, and given the frequent incidence of large-scale natural disasters in the Asia-Pacific region in recent
years, the discussion was based on the theme “Military Logistics Cooperation for International Disaster Relief
Operations.” Each participating country exchanged information and opinions on their respective military


-----

logistics support systems for disaster relief activities,
with the aim of promoting mutual understanding and
building confidence and trust among members.

Following an explanation by each participating

country on their own experiences in international
disaster relief activities, group discussions took place
on military logistics cooperation. The group sessions
succeeded in sharing information about the cooperative
frameworks with militaries of other countries, methods
for effective information sharing, and securing
strategic transportation capabilities. Future challenges Briefing by participants
were also discussed. Participants visited the Eastern
Army where the GSDF logistic support posture was confirmed and views were exchanged.

I have been involved in the MLST for three years since 2005 and there have been times when in

preparation for the meeting prior coordinating telephone calls and e-mail contact with participants have
not gone according to plan, due to differences in culture or customs, etc. As such, with the cooperation
of the SDF personnel member dispatched to the Japanese embassy in each country, I have coordinated
everything from the meeting content to other management items. It is a wonderful experience to exchange
opinions and interact with colleagues in a friendly atmosphere after their arrival in Japan and even though
our countries are different we share many common views as military logistics practitioners, and the meeting
provides an opportunity for us to get together, and deepen our relations of trust. When the approximately
one-week meeting comes to an end and it is time to send off the participants at Narita airport, my feelings
of accomplishment at having successfully concluded the meeting are coupled with regret at having to say
farewell to good friends, and as the organizer of this meeting I truly feel that it has been a valuable experience
to be involved in this process.

The MLST discusses themes that are important for the military logistics personnel in each country, and

by meeting together in Tokyo, and constructing an Asia-Pacific human network, it is an effective means of
promoting mutual understanding that will be truly useful in future international peace cooperation activities,
and enable logistics cooperation. The enthusiasm on the part of the participants from each country continues
to grow each year. I hope that in the future too the MLST will achieve further advancements and will
continue to play an important role in defense exchange.

Section 2. Promotion of Security Dialogue and Defense Exchanges

In the new National Defense Program Guidelines (NDPG), making proactive efforts on its own initiative to help
improve the international security environment is positioned as a major role of defense. Therefore, the Ministry
of Defense and the Self-Defense Forces (SDF) proactively promote security dialogue and defense exchanges,
including bilateral and multilateral training, while also taking part in international peace cooperation activities.

This section will describe the security dialogue and defense exchanges that the Ministry of Defense and the

SDF currently engage in.

**1. Significance of Security Dialogue and Defense Exchanges**
After the end of the Cold War, awareness has grown regarding the importance of preventing meaningless arms
races, and contingencies and the escalation of such events through means such as increasing the transparency
of military capabilities and defense policies, and enhancing mutual relationships of trust through dialogue and
exchanges between defense officials and various joint exercises between military units.

Mutual cooperation and dependence between nations continues to grow within the international community,

and it has become widely recognized that the international community must work together in responding to new
threats and diverse contingencies.

In accordance with these changes in international circumstances, the Ministry of Defense and the SDF place

emphasis on efforts including bilateral exchanges with related nations, multilateral security dialogue such as the
ASEAN Regional Forum (ARF), and multilateral joint exercises. In recent years, in particular, a change has been
seen in the role of defense exchanges, and the defense exchanges tend to deepen in terms of quality and expand
in terms of quantity with the aim of proactively promoting exchanges to improve the security environment.
Specifically, this includes: 1) in addition to confidence-building, the increasing significance of establishing and
strengthening cooperative relations with the international community, 2) a global expansion of exchanges that
extends beyond Japan’s neighboring countries, and 3) the increasing importance of promoting not only goodwill
exchanges but also practical exchanges, and action-oriented exchanges in addition to dialogue.

For this reason, the Ministry of Defense formulated a “Basic Policy for Defense Exchanges[21]” in April 2007

in order for the ministry to implement defense exchanges in a harmonized and strategic manner.

The “Basic Policy” emphasizes defense exchanges[22] aimed at contributing directly to enhancing international

cooperation in addition to promoting traditional defense exchanges. The “Basic Policy” also aims to build
relations of trust and cooperation with other countries by effectively utilizing a variety of defense exchange
measures[23] not limited to bilateral dialogue and consultation. (See Fig. III-3-2-1)

**2. Bilateral Defense Exchanges**
Bilateral defense exchanges are those between defense officials from various countries and with the objective of
promoting relations of trust and cooperation. Characteristically, these exchanges allow a tailor made response in
light of particular relations with an individual nation, and it is possible that the bilateral relationships of trust and
cooperation constructed via these exchanges can lay the foundation for effectively promoting other initiatives
such as multilateral security dialogue.

**1. Japan-Republic of Korea Defense Exchanges**
The Republic of Korea (ROK) is an important country for Japan’s security from a geopolitical perspective. It is
also a friend of Japan as both countries share the fundamental values of freedom and democracy. The ROK has
formed an alliance with the United States and, just as Japan, does allow the U.S. to station its forces in the country
from a security perspective. Therefore, it is extremely important for Japan and the ROK to proactively utilize

**(1) Exchanges of High-Level Defense Officials Including Top Officials**
Almost every year since 1994 (excluding 2001, 2004 and 2006), the defense ministers of Japan and the ROK
have made reciprocal visits and held discussions. In February 2007, then ROK Minister of National Defense Kim
Jang-Soo visited Japan and exchanged views with then Japan’s Minister of Defense Fumio Kyuma on matters
such as the situation in Northeast Asia and their respective national defense policies. Also, at the 7th IISS Asia
Security Summit (commonly referred to as the Shangri-La Dialogue)[24], which was held in May 2008 by the
International Institute for Strategic Studies (IISS) of the United Kingdom, ROK Minister of National Defense
Lee Sang-Hee and former Japanese Minister of Defense Shigeru Ishiba held dialogue and exchanged views on
Japan-ROK defense exchanges. Furthermore, views were openly exchanged on various occasions including in

**(2) Regular Consultations between Defense Officials**
In addition to holding military-to-military consultations (bilateral consultations at the Director-General/Councilorlevel) every year since 1994, Japan and the ROK have held security dialogue since 1998 that has included
diplomatic authorities from both countries.

In July 2007, Japan and the ROK held the 15th military-to-military consultation whereupon views were

exchanged on Japan and the ROK’s defense policies and Japan-ROK defense exchanges. In addition, in December
2007, the first Japan-ROK military-to-military working group was held between Director-level officials.

Furthermore, in October 2007, Japan and the ROK held the seventh bilateral security dialogue where views

were exchanged on matters including the security environment surrounding the two countries and their respective
security policies.

Active dialogue has also been held between Japan’s Joint Staff and the ROK Joint Chiefs of Staff as well

as between Japan’s GSDF, MSDF and the ASDF, and the ROK’s Army, Navy and Air Force respectively. In
addition, Japan and the ROK have been promoting mutual exchange of students and research exchanges.

**(3) Exchanges between Units**
Japan’s GSDF and the ROK Army have held defense exchanges since 2001, including mutual visits by unit
commanders of the GSDF’s Western Army and the ROK’s Second Army[25]. In June 2007, the Commander of the
ROK Second Army visited Japan, and in October 2007, the Commanding General of the Japanese GSDF Western
Army visited the ROK.

Exchanges between Japan’s MSDF and the ROK Navy, including mutual visits by naval vessels, have been

carried out since 1994. In September 2007, a MSDF training squadron visited the ROK, and in December 2007
an ROK Navy cruise training squadron visited Japan. Also, in June 2007, the two navies conducted their fifth
search and rescue exercise.

Japan’s ASDF and the ROK Air Force have continued exchanges through mutual visits by aircraft since 2000.

In June 2007, the commander of the Japanese ASDF Western Air Defense Force visited the ROK, and in May
2008 the ROK Southern Air Force Combat Commander visited Japan. In regards to military band exchanges, the
ROK Air Force Band participated in the November 2007 JSDF Marching Festival.

**2. Japan-Russia Defense Exchanges**
Russia has a great influence on the security of Europe, Central Asia, and the Asia-Pacific region and is a
neighboring country of Japan. It is therefore extremely important for Japan to deepen defense exchanges with
this country and promote relations of trust and cooperation.

With Japan-Russia relations continuing to develop in wider areas following the 1997 summit in Krasnoyarsk,

the Ministry of Defense has been steadily promoting defense exchanges with Russia at various levels in accordance
with the memorandum on Japan-Russia defense exchanges signed in 1999.

**(1) Exchanges of High-Level Defense Officials Including Top Officials**
High-level exchanges have advanced between Japan
and Russia since 1996, when then Minister of State
for Defense Hideo Usui visited Russia, becoming the
first Japanese defense chief to visit the country since
the Soviet era.

When then Japanese Minister of State for Defense

Fukushiro Nukaga visited Russia in January 2006,
Japan and Russia revised the 1999 memorandum on
defense exchanges between the two countries. Then
Russian Defense Minister Sergey Ivanov told that the
Japan-Russia Action Plan was a strong foundation
for deepening cooperation between their respective Joint Staff Saito

Chief of the Russian Armed Forces General Staff Baluyevsky and Chief of Staff,

defense officials. Minister Ivanov also said defense
exchanges had significantly deepened between the MSDF and Russia’s Navy but added that he also wanted
to promote exchanges between the GSDF and Russia’s Ground Force and the ASDF and Russia’s Air Force.
Minister Nukaga and Minister Ivanov shared the view that observers would be mutually dispatched to exercises
conducted by the GSDF and Russia’s Ground Force. They also shared the view that representatives and aircraft
of the ASDF and Russia’s Air Force would make mutual visits. Furthermore, the Commander-in-Chief of the
Russian Ground Force Aleksei Maslov visited Japan in March 2008 and exchanged views with Japanese GSDF
Chief of Staff Oriki, and in April 2008, Chief of Joint Staff Saito visited Russia to exchange views with then
Chief of General Staff Yuri Baluyevsky.

**(2) Regular Consultations between Defense Officials**
The Ministry of Defense has continued to hold discussion with Russia, such as Japan-Russia Bilateral Working
Group meetings and annual meetings based on the Japan-Russia Agreement on the Prevention of Incidents on
and over the High Seas, to discuss how to promote overall defense exchanges in addition to holding regular
discussion between Director-General-level and Councilor-level defense officials.

The GSDF and ASDF have actively held dialogue with their respective Russian counterparts, the Russian

Ground and Air Forces, including Staff Talks between Japan’s Joint Staff and the General Staff Office of the
Russian Armed Forces. In addition, Japan-Russia defense research exchanges and other activities are continually
held between the National Institute for Defense Studies and a research institute affiliated with the Russian
Defense Ministry.

**(3) Exchanges between Units**
The GSDF and the Russian Ground Force have promoted mutual exchanges since 2003, including a mutual
visit between the Russian Commander of Far Eastern Military District and the Commanding General of the


-----

GSDF’s Northern Army. In October 2006, the Commanding General of the GSDF’s Northern Army visited the
Far Eastern Military District of Russia.

The MSDF and the Russian Navy have conducted mutual visits by vessels every year since the MSDF’s first

port visit to Vladivostok in 1996. Both have also conducted bilateral joint search and rescue exercises since 1998.
In August 2007, the MSDF and the Russian Navy conducted their ninth joint search and rescue exercise when an
MSDF vessel was in port at Vladivostok Port.

In December 2007, the Commander of the 11th Air Force and Air Defense Army visited Japan and exchanged

views with the commander of the ASDF Northern Air Defense Force conducting the first inter-unit exchange
between the ASDF and the Russian Air Force.

**3. Japan-China Defense Exchanges**
China has great influence on the Asia-Pacific region and its outstanding economic development and the
modernization of its military capabilities in recent years have drawn much attention from other countries around
the world. Deepening mutual understanding on the defense front and promoting relations of trust with China is
not only beneficial for the security of the two countries, but also for ensuring peace and stability in the AsiaPacific region.

In December 2007, Prime Minister Yasuo Fukuda paid an official visit to China where the two sides shared the

view on positioning the “promotion of exchanges and mutual trust” as one of the three pillars as a materialization
of the “Mutually Beneficial Relationship Based on Common Strategic Interests[26].” The two sides also shared
the view on enhancing exchanges in the security sector, specifically including dispatching an MSDF vessel and
reciprocal visits by company-officer-level officers of the SDF and People’s Liberation Army.

In addition, upon the May 2008 visit of Chinese President Hu Jintao, agreement was made on matters such

as enhancing high-level exchanges between officials including defense ministers, visit by an MSDF vessel to
China, and promptly establishing a communication mechanism between defense officials. In the Joint Statement
between the Government of Japan and the Government of the People’s Republic of China on Comprehensive
Promotion of a “Mutually Beneficial Relationship Based on Common Strategic Interests,” it was also noted that
reciprocal visits by high-level officials in the security sector would be enhanced and that various dialogues and
exchanges would be promoted, thereby further strengthening mutual understanding and trust.

**(1) Exchanges of High-Level Defense Officials Including Top Officials**
In September 2003, former Minister of Defense Shigeru Ishiba visited China and met with then Chinese Minister
of National Defense Cao Gangchuan. At their meeting, Minister Ishiba and Minister Cao shared the recognition
that Japan and China would proactively promote
defense exchanges, including those at the working-level
defense officials.

In August 2007, then Chinese Minister of National

Defense Cao Gangchuan visited Japan and held a
discussion with then Minister of Defense Masahiko
Koumura regarding the international and regional
situation, defense policy of Japan and China, and
Japan-China defense exchanges. During their meeting
they shared the view on the importance of further
developing Japan-China defense exchanges, including
promoting high-level exchanges between officials such Commander of the South Sea Fleet of China Xiao and MSDF Chief of Staff
as defense ministers and chiefs of staff, reciprocal port Yoshikawa (then)

**VOICE**

**Voice of Staff Member in Charge of Japan-China Defense Exchanges**

**Commander Keizo Kitagawa**

**Defense Division, Maritime Staff Office**

There is a saying in the Chinese classic “Zhuangzi”
that states, “Friends agree best at a distance (Exchanges
between wise men remain silent like water.)” In other
words, the relationship between admirable people is an
exchange that flows quietly like water; it never grows
tired, so it continues for a long time. I think this precept
is something that defense exchanges should aim for.

I am in charge of external policy at the Defense

Section, Defense Division, Maritime Staff Office, and
every day I think of how the Maritime Self-Defense
Force can best contribute to defense exchanges for
Japan. My work is highly rewarding, considering the breadth of naval exchanges with countries spanning
the entire globe.

Part of the job involves coordinating staff conferences with the navy of each country, but I feel that

defense exchanges have transformed from an age of simply engaging in “dialogue,” to an age where
substance is demanded, accompanied by action and cooperation.

For instance, what role should the Maritime Self-Defense Force fulfill regarding Japan-China defense

exchanges? The maritime defense capability of one country involves the internationality of naval vessels
visiting foreign countries, which since ancient times, accorded significance as a means of foreign diplomacy.
When you consider that Japan and China have used ships to cross the sea from ancient times, it is easy to see
how their relationship built by the Maritime Self-Defense Force can serve to deepen Japan-China defense
exchanges.

Developments in Japan-China defense exchanges since FY 2007 have been remarkable. The Maritime

Self-Defense Force sent Japan’s first exchange student to the officer training course at the Chinese People’s
Liberation Army National Defense University from September 2007, and from the end of November last year
to the beginning of December, the Chinese destroyer Shenzhen visited Japan for the first time, a particularly
noteworthy event that I feel merits attention. In particular, the visit to Japan of the Shenzhen provided a
valuable opportunity to exchange views with China’s naval personnel.

Furthermore, agreement was reached on Maritime Self-Defense Force ships visiting China, and promoting

high-level exchanges between Japan’s Maritime Chief of Staff and the Chinese People’s Liberation Army
Naval Commanders. Compared to diplomatic relations between both countries, it can be said that JapanChina defense exchanges are in an early stage, but at the same time, I am conscious that the relationship
holds a future full of expectations that it will only deepen going forward. Accordingly, in order to establish
a relationship with China like in the teaching mentioned at the start, I want to incorporate “Think Globally,
Act Locally” as my personal motto in future defense exchanges with China.

calls by naval vessels, and expanding exchanges in various military branches and sectors. Thereupon, Japan
released the Japan-China Defense Authorities Joint Press Release between Japan-China Defense Authorities
the first joint document released between Japanese and Chinese defense authorities. In addition, Chief of Staff,
Joint Staff Saito visited China in February 2008 and held dialogue with Chief of General Staff of the People’s
Liberation Army Chen Bingde. Vice-Defense Minister Kohei Masuda visited China in March 2008 and held
a discussion with Deputy Chief of General Staff Ma Xiaotian and made proposals regarding the intention of
the increase of China’s military spending. He also paid a courtesy call to Minister of National Defense Liang
Guanglie where they shared the view that visits by high-level officials would be continued in the future as well.

**(2) Regular Consultations between Defense Officials**
In July 2006, Japan and China held bilateral security dialogue between diplomatic and defense officials from
both nations. The two countries have also promoted research and educational exchanges, mainly by accepting
Chinese defense officials in regular courses at Japan’s National Institute for Defense Studies and sending Japanese
students to the PLA National Defense University, in addition to continued mutual visits by defense officials from
Japan’s National Institute for Defense Studies, the JSDF Joint Staff College, and China’s PLA National Defense
University.

**(3) Exchanges between Units**
In a meeting between then Minister of National Defense Cao Gangchuan and then Minister of Defense
Masahiko Koumura, the two ministers shared the view on conducting reciprocal port calls by naval vessels
in commemoration of the 35th anniversary of the normalization of Japan-China diplomatic relations, and thus
from November to December 2007 the Chinese destroyer Shenzhen of South China Sea Fleet ported in Tokyo
for the first time. Following this visit, and based on agreement between Japanese and Chinese leaders, an MSDF
destroyer Sazanami visited Zhanjiang in China’s Guandong Province as an MSDF vessel for the first time in June
2008. Furthermore, exchanges are also being promoted, including GSDF personnel being dispatched for the first
time as observers in September 2007 to Chinese military exercise “Warrior 2007” upon invitation from China
and visit to Japan by the delegation of leaders of the Chinese PLA Air Force.

**4. Japan-Australia Defense Exchanges**
Australia is an important partner for Japan in the Asia-Pacific region that shares the fundamental values of respect
for freedom and human rights, and democracy. Regarding security, both Australia and Japan are allies of the
United States and thus share the strategic interest, and there are many interests in common in the area of defense.
From this perspective, it is important for peace and prosperity in the Asia-Pacific region to promote defense
exchanges with Australia to establish a foundation for a cooperative relationship, and to promote collaboration
and cooperation more effectively. Moreover, cooperation between Japan and Australia in the trilateral framework
with the United States and in the multilateral frameworks is important.

In recent years, in particular, defense exchanges between Japan and Australia have deepened and expanded

and bilateral cooperation[27] in the field of security has been advancing steadily, including cooperation in Iraq and
humanitarian support for disasters.

Based on these circumstances, then Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe and then Australian counterpart John

Howard released the Japan-Australia Joint Declaration on Security Cooperation[28] on March 13, 2007 in order for
the two countries to further strengthen bilateral security cooperation under a comprehensive framework.

Based on this joint declaration, then Japanese Minister of Defense Fumio Kyuma and then Australian

counterpart Brendan Nelson held talks in Tokyo in June 2007. During Nelson’s stay in Tokyo, Japan and Australia
also held Joint Foreign and Defense Ministerial Consultations (“two-plus-two”) for the first time. During the


-----

Kyuma-Nelson meeting, Japan and Australia highly evaluated the advancement of defense exchanges between
the two countries and their continued cooperation in international peace cooperation activities since Japan’s
participation in U.N. peacekeeping operations in Cambodia. During their meeting, both ministers also decided
to expand bilateral defense exchanges including promoting unit exchanges through mutual visits of aircraft and
ships and enhancing personnel exchanges and to contribute via bilateral cooperation to trilateral cooperation
among Japan, the United States and Australia, and to multilateral cooperation. They also decided to begin work
on updating the Memorandum on Defense Exchanges, which was agreed between two Defense Ministers in
2003, as the Joint Declaration on Security Cooperation action plan in the field of defense. During their “two-plustwo” meeting, the Defense and Foreign Ministers of Japan and Australia evaluated and welcomed the decision
between Kyuma and Nelson, and released a Joint Statement[29] to that effect. Furthermore, in September 2007, an
action plan to implement the Japan-Australia Joint Declaration on Security Cooperation was drawn up that, with
regard to the field of defense, included such matters as a direction for updating the Memorandum on Defense
Exchanges.

In light of these developments, Japan and Australia are currently holding discussion in order to expand their

defense exchanges.

**(1) Exchanges of High-Level Defense Officials Including Top Officials**
Then Australian Defense Minister Robert Hill visited Japan in September 2003 and met with then Japanese
Minister of Defense Shigeru Ishiba. During their meeting, Hill and Ishiba signed the Memorandum on Defense
Exchanges between Japan and Australia.

In March 2007, then Defense Minister Fumio Kyuma met with then Australian Prime Minister John Howard

during his visit to Japan and they confirmed the need for the two countries to advance bilateral defense exchanges
in the future. In addition, in June 2007, then Defense Minister Kyuma met with then Australian Defense
Minister Brendan Nelson during his visit to Japan to conduct the Japan-Australia Defense Ministerial Meeting.
Furthermore, in May 2008 at the 7th IISS Asia Security Summit, former Defense Minister Ishiba met with
Australian Defense Minister Joel Fitzgibbon and the two concurred on continuing and developing cooperation
in the field of security.

In April 2008, Chief of the Royal Australian Navy Russ Shalders visited Japan and exchanged views with

MSDF Chief of Staff Akaboshi, and ASDF Chief of Staff Toshio Tamogami exchanged views with Chief of the
Royal Australian Air Force Geoff Shepherd on his visit to Australia in May 2008.

**(2) Regular Consultations between Defense Officials**
Japan and Australia have held military-to-military consultations at the Director-General-level and Councilorlevel as well as security dialogue including diplomatic officials almost every year since 1996. The Joint Staff, the
GSDF, the MSDF, and the ASDF have also held consultations with their respective counterparts in the Australian
Defence Force on a regular basis. Both countries also exchange students of their defense-related educational
institutions and hold research exchanges.

**(3) Exchanges between Units**
GSDF units dispatched to international peace cooperation activities in areas such as East Timor and Iraq conducted
exchanges with units of the Australian Army there. Also, the MSDF and the Royal Australian Navy and Air Force
conduct mutual goodwill visits by ships and aircraft. In October 2007, the ASDF dispatched a multi-purpose
assistance aircraft (U-4) to Australia for the first time. (See Column)

**Then Colonel Yasuji Kitamura**

**402 Squadron Commander**

Last year, the ASDF conducted its first overseas flight with the
objective of enhancing defense exchanges and unit visits – a flight
between Japan and Australia by air carrier. In previous overseas
flights, the C-130H transport aircraft was mainly used and unit
exchanges were limited to an additional part of mission flight, but
this time, a U-4 multi-purpose assistance aircraft was used for the first
time, and a goodwill visit was made for the main purpose of defense
exchanges at the airlift unit level between Japan and Australia.

Australia is pro-Japanese, and in an alliance relationship

with the United States like Japan, but the environment was not
conducive for concrete defense exchanges between the two air
forces. However, last year, a high-level agreement between the
Foreign and Defense Ministers of Japan and Australia included
promotion of unit exchanges and was considered to be the first
step toward concrete exchange.

Through our visit to the Royal Australian Air Force Royal Australian Air Force transport aircraft (B-737) and

Royal Australian Air Force transport aircraft (B-737) and

Headquarters and their Air Lift Group, we could achieve mutual participating personnel in the Japan-Australian defense

exchange (left, on the highest rung is Colonel Kitamura)

understanding at the unit level. In particular, in our mutual field as
units operating transport aircraft, we developed awareness of our similarities and differences with regard to
operations, and it was a good opportunity to exchange opinions about future challenges.

My impression of the Royal Australian Air Force is as follows:

m They have the spirit to incorporate positive aspects of other military forces and develop them into their

own unique style.

m While cheerful, delightful and friendly toward SDF personnel, there are many military personnel with

pride as military personnel and love for their country.

m Their equipment is modern and they introduce state-of-the-art systems.

In this unit exchange, an extensive variety of local exchange events were prepared, and we discussed

the future bilateral cooperation and learned about protocols to conduct a reception through planning the
ASDF-hosted reception. I think that such defense exchanges that are not limited to unit operations became
a large building block for the future international activities.

**(4) Cooperation among Japan, the United States and Australia**
In June 2007, upon attending the 6th IISS Asia Security Summit, then Minister of Defense Kyuma held the first
Japan-U.S.-Australia Defense Ministerial Meeting with U.S. Secretary of Defense Robert Gates and then Australian


-----

Minister of Defense Brendan Nelson. In addition, in April 2008, and continuing on talks conducted in April 2007,
Director-General-level meetings were conducted among Japan, the United States and Australia where discussion
was held on matters including trilateral defense cooperation.

Further, in May 2007 and February 2008, defense officials from Japan, the United States and Australia

participated in holding the Pacific Global Air Mobility Seminar. At the seminar views were exchanged on future
trilateral air mobility cooperation. In the February 2008 seminar, the loading exercise of a GSDF CH-47J onto a
U.S. Air Force’s C-17 was conducted. Moreover, in October 2007, trilateral exercise using MSDF patrol aircraft
(P-3C) was conducted for the first time among the MSDF, U.S. Navy, and Royal Australian Air Force.

**5. Japan-U.K. Defense Exchanges**
Being a major power that influences the European region as well as the rest of the world, the U.K. has maintained
close relations with Japan. On the security front, Japan has shared the same strategic interests with the U.K., as
both countries are important allies of the United States. Given this relationship, it is important for both Japan and
the U.K. to promote defense exchanges, build a basis of cooperation, and promote more effective cooperation
and coordination.

In January 2004, former Japanese Minister of Defense Shigeru Ishiba and then U.K. Secretary of State for

Defense Geoff Hoon signed a memorandum on bilateral defense cooperation in order to develop bilateral defense
exchanges in various sectors, thereby confirming the two countries’ resolve to promote defense exchanges at all
levels and in various fields.

**(1) Exchanges of High-Level Defense Officials Including Top Officials**
In January 2006, then Japanese Minister of State for Defense Fukushiro Nukaga visited the U.K. and met with
then U.K. Secretary of State for Defense John Reid. During their meeting, Minister Nukaga and Secretary Reid
confirmed that high-level and working-level defense exchanges advanced between Japan and the U.K. They
also discussed the progress on development of Iraqi Security Forces and the process of transferring security
authorities to Iraq.

Furthermore, at the 7th IISS Asia Security Conference in May this year, U.K. Secretary of State for Defense

Des Browne met with former Minister of Defense Ishiba. During their meeting, Minister Ishiba expressed
gratitude to Secretary Browne for the cooperation being extended by U.K. forces to SDF troops operating in
Iraq. They also shared the view on the importance of replenishment activities in the Indian Ocean.

**(2) Regular Consultations between Defense Officials**
Japan and the U.K. frequently hold dialogue between
Director-General-level and Councilor-level officials. In
June 2007, Japan and the U.K. held DG-level meetings
of Foreign Affairs and Defense authorities as well as
between defense authorities, and exchanged views
on matters such as defense policy and Iraqi issues.
Moreover, the chiefs of Japan’s Joint Staff, the GSDF,
the MSDF, and the ASDF have also held consultations
with their respective U.K. Ministry of Defence
counterparts. Both countries also exchange students
of their educational institutions and promote research
exchanges. Sir Glenn Torpy, Chief of the Air Staff of the U.K. Royal Air Force meets Vice-Minister of Defense Masuda

**(3) Exchanges between Units**
After the deployment of U.K. Forces in Muthanna Province in Iraq, the GSDF[30] troops which had been deployed
since January 2006 in the same area, held active exchanges with the U.K. forces in Samawah, Iraq.

**6. Japan-India Defense Exchanges**
India has traditionally maintained friendly relations with Japan, and shares the same recognition on democracy,
and a free and market-oriented economy.

Moreover, India has a vast territory with a population that exceeds one billion, and possesses great influence on

the security in the South Asian region. This region is important for the safety of sea lanes that connect Japan to the
Middle East as well as activities that Japan conducts in the Indian Ocean and other areas. Against this background, it
is meaningful for Japan and India to hold consultations to exchange views over matters including defense policy and
the regional situation, to deepen mutual understanding, and to promote relations of mutual trust and cooperation.

In December 2006, Indian Prime Minister Manmohan Singh visited Japan and signed a joint statement

between Japan and India after meeting with then Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe. In the joint statement,
the two countries shared the view on upgrading Japan-India relations to “Strategic and Global Partnership[31]”
and specified measures to be taken in the political and security sectors toward building such a partnership. In
addition, in August 2007, then Prime Minister Abe visited India where he and Indian Prime Minister Manmohan
Singh signed the Joint Statement on the Roadmap for New Dimensions to the Strategic and Global Partnership
between Japan and India, and thereupon agreed to study the future course of cooperation in the security field
between the two countries and also enhance defense exchanges.

**(1) Exchanges of High-Level Defense Officials Including Top Officials**
In August 2007, then Minister of Defense Yuriko Koike and then Senior Vice-Minister of Defense Takahide
Kimura visited India and held dialogue with Indian Minister of Defense A.K. Antony and Minister of State for
Defense Pallam Raju. During the defense ministerial meeting, views were exchanged on matters including the
fight against terrorism, regional situation, and Japan-India relations, and the view was shared to further develop
defense exchanges.

In April 2007, then Indian Defense Secretary Shekhar Dutt visited Japan and held a Japan-India Defense

Policy Dialogue with then Japanese Vice-Minister of Defense Takemasa Moriya which was expanded from the
Vice Defense Minister-level meeting. Moriya and Dutt exchanged views on how to deepen defense exchanges
between the two countries in the future and the regional situation.

Moreover, in January 2007, then Indian Air Force Chief of Staff S. P. Tyagi visited Japan and exchanged

views with then ASDF Chief of Staff Yoshida. In April 2007, then Indian Army Chief of Staff J. J. Singh visited
Japan and exchanged views with GSDF Chief of Staff Ryoichi Oriki.

**(2) Regular Consultations between Defense Officials**
In February 2008, Japan and India held Director-General-level and Councilor-level talks between defense
officials and exchanged views about Japan-India defense exchanges and the regional situation. In March 2008,
working-level discussion was also held between the GSDF and Indian Army. Furthermore, Japan and India
actively promote research exchanges, including sending and accepting defense officials as students and mutually
dispatching defense researchers.

**(3) Exchanges between Units**
The MSDF and the Indian Navy have frequently made reciprocal visits in the past. Unit exchanges are active as,
during these reciprocal visits, MSDF Training Squadron and Indian Navy units conduct activities such as goodwill


-----

exercises. In April 2007, three vessels of the Indian Navy paid a port call in Japan, marking the 15th visit to Japan
by Indian Navy vessels. During the Indian vessels’ visit, Japan, the United States, and India conducted their first
trilateral joint maritime exercise. Furthermore, in September 2007, the MSDF participated in a multilateral joint
marine exercise (“Malabar 07-2[32]”) in the waters near the Bay of Bengal for the first time.

**7. Defense Exchanges with Southeast Asian Countries**
Southeast Asian countries are situated in areas deemed as strategically important for maritime traffic, and they
also have close economic relations with Japan. Therefore, promoting dialogue between Japan and these countries
on various security issues and deepening relations of mutual trust and cooperation are of great importance for
both sides.

In November 2007, former Minister of Defense Ishiba had a meeting with Singaporean Defense Minister Teo

Chee Hean who visited Japan, and enhanced mutual understanding on the regional situation and defense policies
of both countries. Both ministers held another meeting at the 7th IISS Asia Security Summit held in May 2008.
Also, in March 2008, former Defense Minister Ishiba had a meeting with Cambodian Deputy Prime Minister and
Defense Minister Tea Banh, and exchanged opinions on the following issues: defense exchange between the two
countries, the regional security situation, and defense policies of both countries.

The recent high-level exchanges between Japan and Southeast Asian countries are shown in Fig. III-3-2-2,

indicating how defense relations between Japan and these countries have steadily progressed.

In addition to exchanges by high-level officials, Japanese defense officials have held consultations at the

working-level on a regular basis to build relations
of mutual understanding and confidence through
exchange of views in the security and defense field and
Japan and Southeast Asian countries have also steadily
promoted staff talks among various services, exchanges
of researchers and students as well as units including
port calls. Through these defense relations, Japan
and Southeast Asian countries lay the foundation for
building a multilateral defense network, which could
play an important role for realizing peace and stability
in the region. (See Fig. III-3-2-2)

**8. Defense Exchanges with Other Countries**
In addition to neighboring countries previously described, Japan has promoted defense exchanges with many other
countries. The Ministry of Defense has held high-level exchanges, working-level consultations and student exchanges
with many other countries around the world. Among them are Pakistan, which has played an important role in the
global fight against terrorism; Canada, with which Japan had undertaken the U.N. peacekeeping operations in the
Golan Heights; Mongolia, an Asia-Pacific country; countries related to the SDF’s mission in Iraq such as Kuwait and
the United Arab Emirates (UAE); European countries, and the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO).

Regarding unit-to-unit exchanges, mutual visits by vessels have been frequent along with mutual exchanges

with countries where international peace cooperation activities are underway.

The recent high-level exchanges are as shown in Fig. III-3-2-3.
In August 2007, then Minister of Defense Koike visited Pakistan for the first time as Defense Minister, and

exchanged views on the fight against terrorism with President Musharraf and then Defense Minister Iqbal and
officials during their meetings. Defense Minister of Luxembourg Schiltz visited Japan for the first time and met with
former Minister of Defense Ishiba in October 2007. Like this, the Ministry of Defense intends to establish a close and
cooperative relationship with many countries. Especially in relations with NATO, policy dialogues and cooperation
have progressed as partners in endeavors for the stability and prosperity of the international community. In January
2007, then Prime Minister Abe participated in the North Atlantic Council for the first time as the Japanese Prime
Minister, and delivered a speech. In May 2007, then Minister of Defense Kyuma visited NATO. In December the

same year, former Minister of Defense Ishiba conducted
a meeting with NATO Secretary General de Hoop
Scheffer and while exchanging opinions on the fight
against terrorism and regional situation, shared the view
to deepen their cooperation as partners sharing common
values and to enhance Japan-NATO relations both in
political and practical aspects. In January 2008, General
Henault, Chairman of the NATO Military Committee,
visited Japan and met with Chief of Staff, Joint Staff
Saito, while paying a courtesy call on former Minister
of Defense Ishiba. Also, a Japan-NATO High-level
consultation was held in March 2008. At the 7th IISS Commander of Pacific Fleet of the French Navy Maurice and MSDF Chief of Staff Akahoshi
Asia Security Summit, former Minister of Defense Ishiba
had meetings with French Defense Minister Morin and Canadian Defense Minister MacKay. Furthermore, in May
2008, Senior Vice-Minister of Defense Eto visited Poland for the first time as a high-level official of the Ministry
of Defense and exchanged opinions with senior officials from the Polish Defense Ministry. From the perspective of
carrying out a wide range of security dialogues and of smooth implementation of international peace cooperation


-----

activities, it is beneficial to develop defense exchanges with various countries, including East European countries.

In this way, through defense exchanges, Japan is playing an important role for the peace and stability of Asia

and the world. (See Fig. III-3-2-4)

**3. Multilateral Security Dialogue**

**1. Significance of Multilateral Security Dialogue**
Multilateral security dialogue is extremely significant because participating countries can increase their mutual
understanding and relations of mutual trust by exchanging views on security issues of mutual concern. Such
security dialogue can also effectively contribute to bringing about regional peace and stability through cooperation
and coordination among countries concerned on regional issues affecting several countries.

**2. ASEAN Regional Forum (ARF)**
At the ASEAN foreign ministers’ meeting and ASEAN Post-Ministerial Conference in 1993, the foreign
ministers from 17 countries and from the European Community (EC), now the European Union (EU), agreed to
create the ASEAN Regional Forum (ARF) as a political and security forum in the Asia-Pacific region. Since its
first ministerial meeting in 1994, the ARF has held its regular ministerial meeting annually. The number of ARF
members has gradually increased annually to currently 26 countries and one organization[33].

At present, the ARF is not a security organization typically seen in Europe, such as NATO and the Organization

for Security and Co-operation in Europe (OSCE), but the ARF is of significance because it provides opportunities
for both foreign and defense officials to attend various inter-governmental meetings.

The Ministry of Defense believes that it is necessary for defense officials among ARF member countries to

enhance mutual confidence along with the evolution of the ARF process so that the ARF can become a forum
to generate a sense of community among Asia-Pacific countries, and thereby stabilize the region’s security
environment. To this end, the Ministry of Defense has been continuing its efforts to deepen mutual understanding
within the ARF through continuous participation in the ARF, by encouraging ARF members to increase the
transparency of their defense policies while explaining Japan’s policies and efforts, and by promoting frank
discussion among defense officials.

In recent years, ARF member countries have been actively exchanging their views on common regional

security issues including international disaster relief activities, maritime security, peacekeeping activities, and
counter-terrorism. The Ministry of Defense has been actively participating in such discussions at the ARF.

Furthermore, in the aforementioned fields, the ARF has begun to look for more practical cooperation. For

example, in the area of international disaster relief, following the drafting of a “general guideline” that should
be considered for international cooperation, the drafting of the “Standard Operation Procedure,” now renewed
as “Strategic Guidance,” which describes more concrete cooperation procedures is underway, while a desktop
exercise took place in Indonesia in May with the participation of the Ministry of Defense.

Every year, ARF holds such meetings as the Senior Officials Meeting (SOM), the Inter-Sessional Support

Group (ISG) Meeting on Confidence-Building Measures and Preventive Diplomacy (CBM[34]/PD) and the ARF
Security Policy Conference in addition to the Foreign Ministerial Meeting. Apart from the so-called plenary
meeting, which is composed of foreign and defense ministry officials, defense officials have convened their
own Defense Officials Dialogue prior to the plenary meeting since the 2002 Ministerial Meeting. The Ministry
of Defense has steadily increased its involvement in the ARF, by actively participating in these meetings, and
frankly exchanging views with defense officials from other ARF member countries.

**3. Multilateral Security Dialogue Sponsored or Participated in by the Japan Defense Ministry and**

**the SDF**

The Ministry of Defense believes that it is important for Japan to take the initiative in multilateral security
dialogue in order to promote relations of mutual confidence and cooperation among defense officials of Japan
and other countries through exchanges of information and opinions. The Ministry of Defense also believes that by


-----

doing so, Japan can contribute to the stability of the Asia-Pacific region. Based on this recognition, the Ministry
of Defense/the Self-Defense Forces have taken the initiative for multilateral security dialogue by sponsoring
various international seminars while it has also actively participated in such forums sponsored by other countries
and other organizations. (See Reference 52-53)

In particular, the Forum for Defense Authorities in the Asia-Pacific Region (Tokyo Defense Forum) has

been sponsored by the Ministry of Defense every year since 1996. The Forum is designed to contribute to the
stability of the Asia-Pacific region by deepening mutual understanding among participating countries on each
other’s defense policy and increasing the transparency of their defense policies. In the forum, defense officials
of participating countries have exchanged views on defense policies of each country, and confidence-building
measures in the field of defense.

At the 12th forum in September 2007, opinions were exchanged on “National and International Efforts for

Peace-Building in Peacetime,” with the participation of 25 countries, the EU, OCHA, ASEAN Secretariat, and the
ICRC. In February 2008, the 7th Sub-committee meeting was held with the participation of 25 countries, the EU,
OCHA, ASEAN Secretariat, and the ICRC which debated “Regional Cooperation and its Import on Surrounding
States,” while deliberating on the content of the “Best Practice Reference Paper for Peace-Building” including
capacity building and elements to be noted for promoting international cooperation with respect to peacebuilding. The IISS Asia Security Conference (Shangri-La Dialogue), an international conference held annually
in Singapore under the sponsorship of a private institute, is the only conference where a large number of defense
ministers in the Asia-Pacific region participate. From Japan, former Minister of Defense Ishiba participated at
the 7th conference in May 2008, and delivered a speech
on important security issues of the same region, under
the theme “East Asian Security and Future.” During the
conference, former Minister of Defense Ishiba paid a
courtesy call on Singaporean Prime Minister Lee Hsien
Loong while having individual meetings with Defense
Ministers of the U.S., Canada, the ROK, France,
Singapore, the U.K., and Australia.

In addition, the Pacific Area Senior Officer Logistics

Seminar (PASOLS) was organized for the first time in
Japan in September 2007 and co-hosted with the U.S.
Army Pacific Headquarters, with 91 participants from Former Senior Vice-Minister of Defense Eto gives a speech at the 12th Tokyo

**4. Multilateral Exercises**

**1. Significance of Multilateral Exercises in the Asia-Pacific Region**
The Defense Ministry and the SDF consider participating in and hosting multilateral exercises will contribute not
only to improving their maneuvering skills but also to helping establish the foundation for building cooperative
relationship among participating countries through the coordination process and exchange of views.

Since 2000, multilateral exercises involving various elements such as humanitarian assistance, disaster

relief and non-combatant evacuation operations, have been conducted in the Asia-Pacific region, in addition to
conventional combat exercises.

Specific exercises thus far conducted on a multilateral basis include refugee rescue training held as part of

the Rim of the Pacific Exercise in 2000; the “Cobra Gold” Exercise conducted by the United States, Thailand
and other countries focusing on U.N. PKO activities and disaster relief operations; the exercise for submarine


-----

rescue drills in the West Pacific, which was hosted by Singapore in 2000, Japan in 2002, the Republic of Korea
(ROK) in 2004 and Australia in 2007; and the Maritime Multilateral Exercise Malabar 07-2 hosted by the U.S.
and India in 2007.

The Ministry of Defense and the SDF will continue to participate in these multilateral exercises proactively

and on their own initiative.

**2. Efforts on Multilateral Exercises in the Asia-Pacific Region**

**(1) Hosting Multilateral Exercises**
The MSDF hosted “Pacific Reach 2002” in April 2002, a multilateral exercise for submarine rescue drills in the
West Pacific[35]. This was the first time Japan hosted a multilateral exercise. In October 2002, the MSDF hosted
the Multilateral Search and Rescue Exercise[36].

The SDF has sent its officers to the annual Cobra Gold exercise since 2005. In May 2008 at Cobra Gold

2008, they engaged in training for non-combatant evacuation operations and transportation of Japanese nationals
overseas, in addition to practices for U.N. PKO command post exercise and medical divisions of humanitarian
and civic assistance activities which they had previously taken part in.

Multilateral exercises in which the SDF has recently participated are as shown in Fig. III-3-2-5.

**(2) Inviting Observers to Multilateral Exercises**
The SDF invited observers from eight countries in the
Asia-Pacific region to Japan in September 2001 to the
4th Japan-Russia Search and Rescue Exercise. Since
then, the SDF has been making efforts to invite observers
from foreign countries to multilateral exercises being
sponsored by the SDF.

The GSDF has invited working-level officers from

countries mainly in the Asia-Pacific region to Japan to
participate in the Multinational Cooperation Program in
the Asia-Pacific (MCAP), which it has hosted annually
since 2002 as part of its multilateral cooperation. (See
Fig. III-3-2-6)

**in the Maritime Multilateral Exercise Malabar**


**Lieutenant Junior Grade Daiki Sakazaki**

**Flight Squadron 6, MSDF**

I am a pilot of a fixed-wing patrol aircraft (P-3C).
In September last year, our P-3C squadron landed in
India for the first time to participate in the maritime
multilateral exercise, Malabar 07-2.

It was the P-3C squadron’s first visit to India and we

experienced some difficulties concerning participation
in training in a land with a different climate and
customs. Initially, it was necessary to spend a lot of
time gathering information from the Air Self-Defense
Force concerning flight experience toward the Middle
East on how to best avoid the air zone where extensive Lieutenant Junior Grade Sakazaki piloting the P-3C

Lieutenant Junior Grade Sakazaki piloting the P-3C

cumulonimbus clouds are generated (intertropical
convergence zone) with the performance of the P-3C
aircraft, and what airports to use in case of emergency
landings due to aircraft trouble, in order to select the
safest flight paths to India. Furthermore, compared to
our own bases in Japan, the air bases in India were not
equipped with the same range of support necessary
for flying, such as aircraft maintenance, so we had to
envision all possible contingencies. Then, within the
weight limitations of the aircraft, we carefully selected
aircraft parts and specialized maintenance equipment
to take with us.

Due to sanitation concerns, we were careful not to

drink untreated water. Nonetheless, after working in the heat all day and adapting to differences in the regional
cuisine, some squadron members became ill. Healthcare is still an issue while participating in exercises in
foreign countries, and these challenges will need to be addressed.

The multilateral exercise was conducted in the Bay of Bengal – about a three-hour flight from Indian air

bases in a P-3C. In contrast to operations within Japan, it was difficult to confirm the operation details and
exchange information with participating squadrons which is normally conducted before flying. However, once
the exercise started, we were able to get communication with foreign ships and aircraft, even though English
with the regional accents of each country was spoken during the exercise.

Through this multilateral exercise in India, a relationship of trust was established with the participating

naval squadrons from India, Singapore and Australia, as well as the U.S. and we believe we also sufficiently
showed the Japanese presence in East Asia. For me personally, it was a valuable experience, and the next time
international activities are ordered, I am confident that I can respond promptly and flexibly.

Section 3. Efforts for Arms Control, Disarmament and Non-Proliferation

In recent years, the international community has firmly recognized the new threat of proliferation of weapons of
mass destruction (WMD), the missiles which serve as their means of delivery, and related equipment and materials
falling into the hands of terrorists and countries of concern. For this reason, efforts toward non-proliferation
which regulate and strictly control their export have become pressing tasks for the peace and stability of today’s
international community.

From a humanitarian point of view, international public opinion demanding regulation of certain conventional

weapons has also been rising. Responding to the issue of regulating certain conventional weapons, while
continuing to consider the balance between such humanitarian demands and defense necessity, has become an
important challenge for all countries.

As an effort to address these challenges, a system concerned with arms control, disarmament and non
proliferation is being developed with the cooperation of all nations worldwide. (See Fig. III-3-3-1)

Based on the above, Japan will play an active role in efforts creating a world free of nuclear weapons by

taking realistic step-by-step measures for disarmament and non-proliferation, as well as in international efforts
related to the disarmament and non-proliferation of other weapons of mass destruction and the missiles which
serve as their means of delivery, and furthermore in those related to the issue of regulating certain conventional
weapons.

This section will explain the measures of the Ministry of Defense and the Self-Defense Forces toward efforts

concerning arms control, disarmament and non-proliferation carried out by international organizations including
the United Nations.

**1. Efforts on Treaties related to Arms Control, Disarmament and Non-Proliferation of**

**Weapons of Mass Destruction**

**1. Nuclear Weapons**

**(1) Related Treaties**
Treaties and export control systems for the purpose of arms control, disarmament and non-proliferation of nuclear
weapons, are shown in Reference 54.

**(2) Japan’s Efforts**
From the perspective of reinforcing systems for disarmament and non-proliferation, Japan has been proactively
participating in discussions for better implementation of the Treaty on the Non-proliferation of Nuclear Weapons
(NPT) as well as discussions in the Nuclear Suppliers Group (NSG), in addition to continuing its work aimed at
the early enforcement of the Comprehensive Nuclear Test Ban Treaty (CTBT), and efforts for the strengthening
of International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) safeguards.

**2. Chemical Weapons/Biological Weapons**

**(1) Relevant Treaties**
Treaties and export control systems for the purpose of arms control, disarmament and non-proliferation of
chemical and biological weapons, are shown in Reference 55.

**(2) Japan’s Efforts**
**a. Since 1980, the Ministry of Defense and the SDF have dispatched chemical protection specialists from the**
GSDF to the negotiations of the Chemical Weapons Convention (CWC) when required. As members of the
Japanese delegation they assisted to draft the convention. Since 1997, when the convention came into effect,
GSDF experts on protection from chemical weapons have been dispatched to the Hague, the Netherlands, to
implement verification measures stipulated in the convention. (See Reference 56)

At the GSDF Chemical School (Saitama City), small quantities of chemical substances, which are the target

of regulation in the convention, are synthesized for the purpose of protection research. Therefore, in accordance
with the stipulations of the convention, inspections have been implemented a total of six times since the initial
establishment of the organization.

In addition, the government as a whole is working on projects to dispose of chemical weapons that were

abandoned in China, based on the CWC. Based on results of investigations so far, it is estimated that even now up
to approximately 300,000 to 400,000 chemical weapons of the former (Imperial) Japanese Army remain buried
in Haerbaling District, Dunhua City, Jilin Province, China. The Ministry of Defense and the SDF have relocated
five personnel, including GSDF officers to the Cabinet Office, which is responsible for the disposal of abandoned
chemical weapons. In addition, collaboration is being given in areas such as the dispatch of GSDF officials who
are specialists in chemistry and ammunition disposal, to excavation and recovery operations for abandoned
chemical weapons, carried out in China.

Since 2000, GSDF officers have been dispatched to the location for excavation and recovery projects a

total of seven times. From August through September last year, eight SDF officers participated in excavation
and recovery projects in Lianhuapao, Dunhua City, Jilin Province, China conducted by the Cabinet Office, and
carried out measures such as the identification and emergency disarmament of shells.
**b. With regard to the Biological Weapons Convention (BWC), cooperation is being given to efforts to strengthen**


-----

it. This is in areas such as the dispatch of SDF officers who are pharmaceutical and medical specialists, to
relevant meetings such as multinational negotiations related to the introduction of BWC verification measures.
**c. Personnel have been dispatched to the Australia Group (AG) Meeting every year since 1994, and they are**
collaborating to help make the group’s regulations and agreements effective.

**3. Delivery Means (Missiles)**

**(1) Relevant Agreements**
International political agreements and export control systems for the purpose of arms control, disarmament and
non-proliferation of means of delivery (missiles) are shown in Reference 57.

**(2) Japan’s Efforts**
The Ministry of Defense has been dispatching personnel to the assembly of the Missile Technology Control
Regime (MTCR) every year since 1992, and they are collaborating to help make the MTCR’s regulations and
agreements effective.

**2. Efforts on Arms Control-Related Treaties on Certain Conventional Weapons**

**1. Related Treaties**
Treaties and export control systems for the purpose of arms control, disarmament and non-proliferation of certain
conventional weapons recognized as being inhumane, are shown in Reference 58.

**2. Japan’s Efforts**

**(1) The Convention on Prohibitions or Restrictions on the Use of Certain Conventional**

**Weapons Which May Be Deemed to Be Excessively Injurious or to Have Indiscriminate**
**Effects (CCW)**

In recent years, negotiations and reviews have been conducted to reduce the humanitarian risks that may be
brought about by Explosive Remnants of War (ERW) such as unexploded ordnance.

In the 2003 Conference of the State Parties, Protocol V, related to post-conflict remedial measures of a generic

nature in order to minimize the danger of post-conflict ERW was adopted (coming into effect in November 2006).

However, discussion regarding ERW continued, due to the necessity of responding to the problems brought

about in particular by unexploded cluster munitions (munitions that have multiple sub-munitions in themselves),
and at the Conference of the State Parties in November last year, it was decided to carry out negotiations at
meetings of State governmental experts this year, for the purpose of responding promptly to the humanitarian
concern of cluster munitions.

Regarding the issue of cluster munitions regulation, Japan contributes actively to these issues from the

perspective of striking a balance between the humanitarian concern and its security necessity, as well as gaining
the participation of major producers and possessors of them. Japan engages in active discussions with relevant
countries by dispatching a delegation, including personnel from the Ministry of Defense, to the conferences of
the State Parties and group of governmental experts, where discussion and negotiations are taking place for the
purpose of the addition of protocol.

**(2) The Oslo Process[37]**

Regarding the cluster munitions issue, momentum was gained for the restriction of cluster munitions out of


-----

the CCW, and the international conference was held in Oslo in February 2007 where the Oslo Declaration
was adopted, claiming to conclude an international agreement by 2008 to ban cluster munitions which cause
unacceptable harm to civilians. As a result of negotiations in the series of international conferences that followed,
the Convention on Cluster Munitions was adopted by 111 countries, including Japan, at the Dublin Conference
in May 2008.

As for the convention of the Oslo Process, Japan is seriously considering concrete steps to follow the signing

of the Convention, while studying necessary security measure. The Defense Ministry is also appropriately
debating while following its own policies.

**(3) The Convention on the Prohibition of the Use, Stockpiling, Production and Transfer of**

**Anti-Personnel Mines and on Their Destruction**

The Ministry of Defense and the SDF began disposing of anti-personnel mines in January 2000. In February
2003, the destruction of all anti-personnel mines was completed excluding the minimum necessary amount
retained as an exception, recognized in the convention for the purpose of developing technology and training in
landmine detection and clearance.

Meanwhile, in order to maintain the security of Japan, as an alternative that poses no danger of causing harm

to civilians and does not correspond to the anti-personnel landmines banned in the convention, the acquisition of
an anti-personnel obstacle system, which includes directional fragmentation charges[38], is proceeding.

As of November last year, 156 nations have concluded this convention, but only 12 out of 26 ARF participating

nations have done so. For this reason, until now the Ministry of Defense has encouraged ARF participating
nations who have not yet concluded this convention to do so.

What is more, the Ministry of Defense has been submitting annual reports to the United Nations on data

such as exceptional possession, while also actively cooperating in the international efforts on the issue of antipersonnel mines, by dispatching its staff from time to time to relevant international conferences[39].

**(4) U.N. Register of Conventional Arms**
Every year, the Ministry of Defense registers data on import amount of defense equipment with the United
Nations, while also voluntarily providing information related to its possession, domestic procurement and the
transfer of small weapons. It also dispatches its staff from time to time to expert meetings and so on, for the
purpose of reviews, which are carried out to improve and strengthen this system.

**3. International Efforts for Non-Proliferation of Weapons of Mass Destruction and Others**

**1. Proliferation Security Initiative (PSI)**

**(1) Background Behind Adoption of the PSI**
The Bush administration was deeply concerned that countries of proliferation concern such as North Korea
and Iran are engaged in the development of weapons of mass destruction and missiles. In December 2002 it
announced the National Strategy to Combat Weapons of Mass Destruction, and advocated the comprehensive
three-pillared approach of “non-proliferation,” “counter-proliferation,” and “responding to the effects of WMD
use.”

As a part of this President Bush announced the Proliferation Security Initiative[40] (PSI) in June 2003, and as

a result of his request for the participation of nations in the effort, as of May this year, it has developed into an
international approach with the support of over 90 countries, including Japan.


-----

**(2) Past Achievements of PSI and Japan’s Efforts**
Participating nations have agreed to the Statement of Interdiction Principles[41] which declared the objectives of
PSI up until now and principles for the purpose of interdiction. Interdiction training is carried out in all fields of
ground, maritime and air transportation etc., in order to increase WMD proliferation interdiction capabilities. As
of March of this year, various kinds of PSI interdiction training (only field training exercises) have been carried
out a total of 31 times.

In addition to this training, meetings have been held by the PSI participating nations, and discussions are

being held to tackle the policy and legislative challenges faced.

As a result of such activities, there have been some success stories in actual operations, such as the BBC

China Incident[42] which validated the effectiveness of PSI.

The objective of PSI is to contribute to the improvement of the national security environment, and as such

Japan has been continuing to play an important role since the start of PSI in June 2003.

**(3) Efforts by the Defense Ministry and SDF**
It has been thought necessary for the Ministry of Defense and the SDF to continue to make maximum use of
the SDF’s capabilities in these kinds of Japanese efforts, to cooperate with relevant organizations and countries
and to proactively contribute to PSI. After the third Paris Plenary Meeting, in addition to dispatching Ministry
of Defense personnel including SDF personnel to a variety of meetings, Japan dispatched observers to PSI
interdiction exercises conducted overseas, and gathered related information.

In October last year, along with relevant organizations such as the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, the National

Police Agency, the Ministry of Finance and the Japan Coast Guard, Japan hosted the second PSI Maritime
Interdiction Exercise (Pacific Shield 07)[43], following the previous exercise in 2004. The SDF has conducted
a joint exercise and played a proactive role on its own initiative in a number of joint exercises. This exercise
included carrying out exhibition training related to search, identification and tracking at sea by the MSDF and
ASDF, boarding and on-the-spot inspections by the MSDF, and decontamination of suspicious substances in
ports by the GSDF.

Through these proactive efforts, for example in the case of PSI maritime interdiction activities, the relevant

information obtained through information gathering activities (such as surveillance by ships of the MSDF and by
aircraft of the MSDF and ASDF) is provided to relevant organizations and countries. Furthermore, it is thought
that the MSDF will be able to carry out effective boarding and on-the-spot inspections of suspicious ships, with
the cooperation of the Japan Coast Guard in the event that maritime security operations are ordered. When cargo
inspection is carried out in harbors and so on, it is believed that the decontamination capabilities of the GSDF will
be able to effectively assist in PSI activities, if by some
chance harmful substances such as chemical agents are
spilt.

Also, as a part of the proactive approach (outreach

activities) for the purpose of strengthening comprehensive
non-proliferation systems including PSI, Japan has been
actively providing information and knowledge gained
through past training to the national defense authorities
of other Asian countries, and has been taking advantage
of opportunities such as defense exchanges to work
on promoting understanding toward PSI. (See Fig.
III-3-3-2) Boarding inspection training by MSDF personnel

**(4) Future Efforts**
Bearing in mind examples of proliferation in the area around Japan, grasping PSI as a security issue that widely
includes factors such as defense, diplomacy, law enforcement and export management, is necessary to concentrate
the combined efforts of Japan, and to ensure that the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction is prevented,
through constant voluntary and proactive efforts.

For this reason, Japan will positively contribute to PSI in the future as well, and give consideration toward the

systems within the government, while continuing to closely cooperate with relevant organizations and so on.

Also, from the perspective of increasing the capability of the SDF, Japan has been considering participating

in and hosting interdiction exercises.

**2. Security Council Resolution 1540 Concerning the Non-Proliferation of Weapons of Mass**

**Destruction**

In April 2004, the United Nations Security Council unanimously voted for the adoption of Security Council
Resolution 1540 on the Non-Proliferation of Weapons of Mass Destruction, which aims to take appropriate
and effective action toward the threat that proliferation of NBC (Nuclear, Chemical, Biological) weapons, and
their means of delivery poses to the peace and security of the international community. Under Chapter VII of
the United Nations Charter, its details include: 1) to refrain from providing support of any kind to non-state
actors attempting to develop weapons of mass destruction and their means of delivery, 2) to adopt and execute
appropriate and effective legislation to prohibit the manufacture etc., of weapons of mass destruction and their
means of delivery by terrorists in particular, and 3) to establish border controls and export control measures for
the purpose of preventing the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction and their means of delivery.

Based on the danger imposed by the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction on the peace and stability

of the international community, which includes Japan, the prevention of proliferation of these weapons of mass
destruction to non-state actors such as terrorists, is an urgent task for the international community. Based on the
recognition of this fact, Japan supports the adoption of this resolution, and hopes that all United Nations members
will observe the resolution.

###### Measures for Defense of Japan

### Chapter 4

Citizens of Japan, the Ministry of Defense and the SDF

**Section 1. Sustaining Defense Capabilities**
**Section 2. Interaction between the Ministry of Defense & the SDF, and the Local Community &**

**Japanese Citizens**


-----

Defense capabilities are the ultimate guarantee of a country’s security and no other means can replace this function.
For the core of the SDF’s defense capabilities, it is not enough to simply create the necessary organization, but it
is also indispensable for the SDF to earn the understanding and support of the Japanese people in order to execute
its missions. It is also important to establish human resources[1] and a foundation of equipments and facilities.

With the above background, this chapter explains the following four aspects:

m The organization of the Ministry of Defense and the SDF.
m The process from recruitment and employment, through education and training, to retirement and outplacement

of personnel.

m Details on information and communication systems, which is the foundation for all equipment and related

matters. (These are examined in Section 1.)

m Activities by the Ministry of Defense and the SDF together with local communities, to gain the support of the

Japanese people. (Section 2)

Section 1. Sustaining Defense Capabilities

Defense capabilities depend on organization and human resources. The operational efficiency of organizations
depends on the capabilities of their personnel, not only equipment and systems. Under the security environment
of recent years, missions have become more diverse and international in character, and equipment within the
Ministry of Defense and the SDF[2] has been improved. Human resources must therefore be improved too, which
means securing and training high-quality personnel.

This section explains the development of the organization and of human resources in the Ministry of Defense

and the SDF, measures for the enhancement of information and communications capabilities, and the enhancement
of technical research and development.

**1. Organization of the MOD/SDF**
The Self-Defense Forces (SDF), the core of Japan’s defense capability, is a specialist organization that plays the
most essential role in the continued existence of the country, that is, national defense. The SDF consists of a full
range of units and services that provide the functions required to fulfill that responsibility.

**1. Organization of the MOD/SDF**
The MOD/SDF consist of a number of organs that center on the Ground Self-Defense Force (GSDF), Maritime
Self-Defense Force (MSDF), and Air Self-Defense Force (ASDF), to fulfill their mission of defending Japan as
armed organizations, and a number of other organs including the National Defense Academy, National Defense
Medical College, National Institute for Defense Studies, Defense Intelligence Headquarters (DIH), Technical
Research and Development Institute (TRDI), Equipment Procurement and Construction Office, and the Inspector
General’s Office of Legal Compliance. (See Figs. III-4-1-1, III-4-1-2)

**2. System to Support the Minister of Defense**
The Minister of Defense, in accordance with the provisions of the SDF Law, is in charge of the SDF, and is
supported by the Senior Vice-Minister of Defense and two Parliamentary Secretaries for Defense. The Minister
of Defense is supported by the Administrative Vice-Minister of Defense in supervising administrative work, and
the Defense Counselors in setting up basic policies, respectively.

Moreover, the Internal Bureau, Joint Staff and Ground Staff Office, Maritime Staff Office, and Air Staff

Office support the Minister of Defense. The Internal Bureau is responsible for basic policies relating to the work
of the SDF. The Director-General of the Secretariat and Directors-General of the Bureaus, as part of their own


-----

responsibilities, support the Minister of Defense when the Minister of Defense gives instructions and authorization
to the Chief of Joint Staff (Chief of Staff, Joint Staff), and Chief of Ground Staff (GSDF Chief of Staff), Chief
of Maritime Staff (MSDF Chief of Staff), and Chief of Air Staff (ASDF Chief of Staff). The Joint Staff is a
staff organization for the Minister of Defense concerning SDF operations. The Chief of Joint Staff supports the
Minister of Defense by providing unified military expert advice on SDF operations. The Ground Staff, Maritime
Staff, and Air Staff are the staff organizations for the Minister of Defense concerning their respective services
(excluding operations, with the Chiefs of Staff for the GSDF, MSDF, and ASDF acting as the top-ranking expert
advisors to the Minister of Defense.

SDF Provincial Cooperation Offices, which are

located in 50 locations throughout the nation (four
in Hokkaido, and one in each prefecture), conduct
recruitment with the help of prefectural and municipal
governments, schools, private recruitment counselors
and others. Local public organizations are also required
to carry out administrative recruitment activities[4], and Recruitment by local cooperation headquarters
the Ministry of Defense defrays the costs incurred by
local public organizations.

Since recruitment of the SDF personnel is likely to become increasingly difficult with the declining birth

rate in Japan, it is necessary to seek the assistance of local public organizations, related organizations and other
community organizations. (See Fig. III-4-1-3) (See Reference 60)

**2. Employment[5]**

**(1) SDF Regular Personnel**
SDF Regular Personnel enlist of their own free will on a volunteer basis and are employed as General Officer
Candidates; General Candidates for Enlisted (Upper[6]), Privates (GSDF), Seaman Apprentices (MSDF), Airmen
Third Class (ASDF), and others[7]. Because of the special nature of the work they do, personnel management
performed for SDF Regular Personnel is distinct from that of general civilian government employees[8].

Personnel management of the SDF Regular Personnel differs significantly from that of general civilian

government employees because the former adopts an early retirement system and a short-term service system
to keep the forces strong. Under the early retirement
system, the SDF Regular personnel retire at a younger
age than general civilian government employees.
Meanwhile, under the short-term service system,
employment may be completed in two or three years.
Upon employment, the SDF Regular personnel who
enlist in each SDF service complete the basic education
and training in a training unit or at a school of each SDF
service, and are then assigned to units and positions
nationwide.

The preferences and aptitude of each personnel

are taken into consideration when assigning them to
occupational areas and positions, which are determined Freshman wears uniform for the first time
before they complete their basic education. (See
Reference 61-63)

**VOICE**

**Voice of a Staff Involved in the Disbandment of the Defense Facilities Administration**

**Agency and Compilation of its History**

**Akira Takahashi**

**South Kanto Defense Bureau**

**(Previously working at the Defense Facilities Administration Agency)**

The Defense Facilities Administration Agency was
disbanded and integrated into the Ministry of Defense
in September last year. The decision, which followed
the incident of the agency officials’ involvement in the
bid-rigging in January 2006, was a great shock to the
staff who must have felt an immense sense of loss. I
think many of those who have once worked at the
agency had the same feeling.

Under such situation, then Director-General of

the Defense Facilities Administration Agency Iwao
Kitahara proposed to compile the History of the General team that took part in the editing of the history of the Defense

Facilities Administration Agency (General Manager Takahashi, center)

Defense Facilities Administration Agency before its
disbandment. That was how the all-agency project was
launched. Five persons from the General Affairs Division, including myself, were involved as a “Wrap-up
Team.” We worked until midnight everyday: collecting data, drafting, adjusting layout, and doing all other
tasks which were completely new to us.

The History of the Defense Facilities Administration Agency is the history of the issues related to the

military bases in Japan. Originally started as the Special Procurement Agency, the agency has always been at
the forefront of military base issues as Japan went through the Allied Occupation, development and expansion
of the Self-Defense Forces, the reversion of Okinawa, and so on. We decided to compile a comprehensive
history recording the outline of the base issues and its transformation, including the movement of local
communities. However, we only had limited time and the process was not straightforward.

On the other hand, I was excited to hear directly from the former agency staff and the local people involved

in the base issues. We felt like making a trip back in time to witness some of the well-known incidents.

Compiling the History, we once again realized how challenging the agency’s task was to acquire facilities

and ensure their stable operation. At the same time, I felt great respect for those who have diligently fulfilled
their task in spite of the difficulty. It was their effort, I believe, that founded the cornerstone of Japan’s national
security.

The History was completed right before the final day of the agency. I will never forget how the book felt

and weighed when we first handled it. Although it is up to the readers to judge the content, I do think that our
original intentions were mostly fulfilled.

Reading it again, I renew my conviction that the articles contributed to the History, including those from

the local residents, convey a message to us that further efforts are being expected to resolve the base issues
that remain even after the disbandment of the Defense Facilities Administration Agency. About a year has
passed since the agency was reorganized into the Defense Ministry. I think we need to keep up our efforts to
live up to the people’s expectations and to make the best out of this reorganization.

**(2) SDF Ready Reserve Personnel, SDF Reserve Personnel, and Candidates for SDF Reserve**

**Personnel[9]**

**a. Purpose for Establishing the Reserve Personnel System**
Normally, the number of SDF Regular Personnel is kept to the minimum needed to respond to situations: SDF
Regular Personnel need to be available immediately in an emergency as the need arises. To meet such needs
promptly and systematically, there are three systems: the SDF Ready Reserve Personnel System, the SDF
Reserve Personnel System, and the System for Candidates for SDF Reserve Personnel[10].

In particular, the System for Candidates for SDF Reserve Personnel, which is mainly for personnel without

experience, was established to develop and expand the defense basis, secure the stability of SDF Reserve
Personnel, and effectively use civilian expertise in fields such as medical practice and language skills.

**[COLUMN]**


**VOICE**

**Voice of a Newcomer (a General Officer Candidate, GSDF)**

**Second Lieutenant Aki Tsuchiyagaito**

**1st Anti-Aircraft Artillery Company, GSDF**

What does it mean to shine at work?

I am working at the 1st Anti-Aircraft Artillery Company in Hokkaido, which forms a part of the ground/air

defense.

I joined the Self-Defense Forces (SDF) about one year ago, attracted by the catchphrase that I happened

to see, “There are people I want to protect.” Although there are many other ways to help people, the mission
of the Ground Self-Defense Force (GSDF) appealed to me in particular. I pictured myself protecting Japan’s
peace and independence and safeguarding the people.

I enrolled in the Officer Candidate School filled with dreams and hopes.
Initially I had difficulty adjusting to the new life. I sometimes felt like giving up, frustrated at my immaturity

and the disparity between ideal and reality. But I hardly had time to contemplate this. Basic training of the
GSDF awaited us, such as a general drill involving a 100-kilometer march. As I overcame one difficulty after
another, I realized myself improving step by step. I owe my progress to the wonderful colleagues and attentive
instructors who were always there to support me.

I graduated from the Officer Candidate School in December last year. Although it only lasted for three

months, I learned much from the regimental training for the infantry which forms the core of the GSDF. At the
27th Infantry Regiment in Kushiro, Hokkaido, we joined the regular infantry members for combat training,
target practices, street fighting training, ski marching, wintertime inspection, and so on to experience the real
life at a unit and the fighting spirit. The “fighting spirit” which I acquired at the 27th Infantry Regiment will
stay with me for the rest of my career.

I was appointed Second Lieutenant in March this year, and started working at the Anti-Aircraft Artillery

Company which I had strongly desired to be assigned to. From now on, I will be expected to lead the unit as an
officer, in addition to fulfilling the duties of a combatant. The GSDF treasures the heart-to-heart interaction of
people. During my everyday interactions with people, I find that they are more often motivated by emotion than
plain logic. I wonder what is needed for me to be a leader without having much experience. Whenever in doubt,
I always try recalling the motto “passion and sincerity,” which my instructor at the Officer Candidate School
constantly reminded us. Strategic, tactical thinking is required for an officer, but at the same time, I believe it
is this “passion and sincerity” that brings the unit together. I will keep that in mind as I realize my mission and
take care of every single member of the unit.


-----

Since there are a small number of female service members in the SDF, becoming an officer may prove to

be a difficult path. But that does not preclude the possibility. There have been a number of active female service
members so far and many paths will be available for female members in the future. For the time being, I think
my task is to keep shining in the unit, believing that would foster a strong team by bringing the members closer
together.

There are two employment categories in the SDF Reserve Personnel system: general and technical. Personnel

hired in the technical category are healthcare professionals and qualified technical personnel in such fields as
languages and information processing.

Candidates for SDF Reserve Personnel are appointed as SDF Reserve Personnel following completion of the

education and training necessary to work as SDF personnel. In recent years, SDF Reserve Personnel employed
with qualifications as healthcare professionals have participated in general disaster prevention drills as medical
officers once being appointed as SDF Reserve Personnel, and those employed through their language qualifications
have been active as interpreters, participating in Japan-U.S. joint armies of the GSDF post exercises and activities
in other fields, following their appointment as SDF Reserve Personnel. (See Reference 64-65)

**VOICE**

**Voice of a Newcomer (Student Pilot, MSDF)**

**Petty Officer Second Class Tomoharu Inoue**

**Student Pilot, MSDF**

I am currently in training as a student pilot at Ozuki Air Station, Shimonoseki, Yamaguchi Prefecture. I have
loved airplanes since I was a child, and becoming a pilot had been my long-time dream. However, things
were not that easy. I failed the entrance exam for the student pilot course twice because of my poor vision.
But I did not give up and tried again for a third time. This time, the vision requirement was greatly reduced
and I finally gained long-awaited entry to the course.

“Dreams can be realized as long as you don’t give up.” That is the lesson I learned from this experience.
Student pilots spend their first two years or so at Ozuki Air Station, where they learn basic academic skills

in mathematics, English and physics, and cultivate the physical and mental strength required for MSDF staff.

After these two years, we begin learning piloting techniques at the 201st Air Training Unit. That is where

I am right now, which is the first crucial step for realizing my dream to become a pilot. I must first become


-----

acquainted with the airplane, and then be able to take
off and land on my own.

Within no more than 20 hours after first handling

the control stick, we took a solo flight without the
guidance of an instructor. I was excited at the idea of
being on my own in the open sky, but the pressure was
immense as I assumed all the responsibilities of the
flight. Nevertheless, having the entire sky right in front
of me for myself was a truly rewarding experience. The
thrill I felt during my first solo flight is still fresh in my
memory.

After that, we learn acrobatic flight, instrument

flight, navigation and formation flight. At the recent
navigation training, I happened to fly over my hometown. I was greatly moved as I had never imagined myself
as a pilot, flying over my old home and town.

I owe my accomplishments to the attentive guidance of my instructors. They could be demanding at times

because even a single error can be fatal.

I was assigned to a fixed-wing aircraft as I desired. I will keep up with the training to become a regular

P-3C pilot at the earliest possible date, so that I can work at the forefront of Japan’s maritime defense.

**b. Cooperation from Corporations Employing Personnel**
In addition to carrying out their normal duties, SDF Reserve Personnel and other personnel are also expected to
undergo training to maintain the required skills. To attend such training, they take leave or vacation, or adjust
their work schedules accordingly. To function smoothly, such systems require the understanding and cooperation
of the employers of the personnel. SDF Ready Reserve Personnel, in particular, attend training for 30 days a year,
so employers need to allow Ready Reserve Personnel to take this leave and prepare for their absence.

To assist, the Ministry of Defense provides a special subsidy to companies and other organizations to cover

for their Ready Reserve Personnel when attending training sessions and the like. This reduces the burden on such
employers.

**Voice of a Newly Enlisted SDF Personnel (ASDF General Candidate for Enlisted (Upper))**

**Airman Second Class Hiroki Takahashi**

**Air Basic Training Wing 1st Basic Training Group**

**General Candidate for Enlisted (Upper), ASDF**

What kind of dreams do you want to realize?

My dream is to have a job that contributes to the society. As I was thinking about how to make this dream a

reality, my father’s friend coincidentally introduced me to a provincial cooperation officer, which gave me the
opportunity to realize my dream in the ASDF.

After considering the challenges of the “Student Candidate for Enlisted (Upper) System,” a course to train

future ASDF personnel to become key personnel, I joined the SDF.


-----

Prior to joining the SDF I did not have much

understanding of what kind of jobs the SDF was
involved in. However, as I learned more and more about
the SDF’s role after my enrollment, I started to believe
that it was a necessary job for the safety of Japan and
the peace of the international community.

Presently, as a first term General Candidate for

Enlisted (upper), I am receiving basic training as an
SDF member in the ASDF training unit. Although this
period will lay the groundwork for ASDF members
and includes subjects that are mentally and physically

Airman Second Class Takahashi in highball training (right)

challenging, I am steadily learning and improving, and
my fellow comrades and I encourage each other. I will
continue to work hard everyday to graduate from this course, until the day that I am promoted to 4th class, at
the earliest time, and become a reliable member of the ASDF. At that time, I hope to contribute to international
peacekeeping operations and disaster relief dispatches as a representative of Japan. Among the many units in
the ASDF, I would like to serve in the rescue unit.

In addition, if possible, I hope to become a pilot within the ASDF and to continue to challenge myself. This

is because becoming a pilot is my other dream.

Lastly, I hope to never forget my present aspirations and to strive toward the achievement of my dreams,

without regret.

**(3) Administrative Officials, Technical and Engineering Officials, Instructors, and Other**

**Civilian Personnel**

There are approximately 23,000 civilian officials – Administrative Officials, Technical and Engineering Officials,
or Instructors, and others – in addition to SDF Regular Personnel at the Ministry of Defense and the SDF. These
civilians are mainly employed through the Class I Examination for National Public Workers, or the Class I, II, or
III Examination for Ministry of Defense Civilian Officials. After participation in the same training course, Class
I and II personnel undertake a wide range of work.

Administrative officials are engaged in planning defense policies and management, and the basic operation

of the SDF at the Internal Bureau; intelligence works of the Defense Intelligence Headquarters (DIH); and
administrative works (general affairs, measures to ensure harmony between defense facilities and surrounding
communities, and others) and provide logistic support (maintenance, supply, and others) to SDF units throughout
Japan.

Technical and Engineering Officials work at the Technical Research & Development Institute (TRDI) and

other organizations, where they conduct R&D to maintain and improve the level of technology of the nation’s
defense capabilities. Instructors’ duties include basic investigation and research on the management and
operation of the SDF at the National Institute for Defense Studies, and cultivation of highly qualified personnel
at organizations such as the National Defense Academy and the National Defense Medical College.

As of the end of March 2008, there were 602 Technical and Engineering Officials and Instructors with

doctoral degrees.

Moreover, in the various organizations where these civilian officials work, SDF Regular Personnel of the

GSDF, MSDF and ASDF work together with the civilians, mainly in fields where the special knowledge of SDF
Regular Personnel is required.

**[COLUMN]**

**VOICE**

**Voice of a Crew Member of the Icebreaker Shirase**

**Chief Petty Officer Yoshihiko Matsumoto**

**Icebreaker Shirase, MSDF**

I have been involved in three missions so far to support Antarctic expeditions. One such on board mission
happened to be the maiden voyage of the current _Shirase, which took place in 1981 (25th Antarctic_
expedition), five years after I joined the MSDF in 1976. At first, everything I saw was new to me, so the
months-long mission was spent in complete wonder.

However, things were different when I boarded _Shirase two years ago after a 23-year interval. As I_

arrived at Showa Base in Antarctica, I was shocked to see how dramatically things had changed. There was
an abundance of high-tech equipment so that we could get almost the same information as in Japan. During
my initial visit, we only had satellite telephones and telegraphs, so I completely lost touch with current
affairs and trends after being there for five months.

The primary mission of Shirase is to supply Showa Base with food and other necessities. It also provides

support for base building at Showa Base and assists in field and maritime observations. Because these tasks
must be completed within a specific timeframe, weather becomes our biggest concern every day. Even
during the summer season, we need to dress appropriately for the cold as the temperature can drop well
below -10˚C. We also need to protect ourselves against ultraviolet rays when working outside. Without
sunglasses and sunscreen, a tan from the snow or injury to the eyes could occur within a few hours. These
are just some of the challenges crew members face during their everyday duties.

The successor to Shirase is scheduled to be commissioned this April. The new ship will offer increased

efficiency in transportation capabilities, such as containerizing goods and supplies, loading large onboard
helicopters and others. It also has an expanded capacity to accommodate 80 expedition team members,
compared to the previous 60, which will enable additional research observation and base building at the
site.

It is imperative that our operational support for Antarctic expeditions continue to live up to the public

expectations. I am confident that the 40-year long tradition founded by our predecessors on Fuji and Shirase
will be inherited and nurtured by future generations.

**3. Daily Education and Training[11]**

In order to accomplish its missions such as the defense of the country, the SDF needs commanding officers and
other members who possess excellent knowledge and skills and to be highly qualified, and it also needs each
unit to maintain a high level of proficiency. Personnel
are always required to be prepared to demonstrate
their capabilities in any situation, so that the SDF
can immediately and appropriately deal with various
situations and deter any country threatening to invade
Japan.

Education and training are crucial for the SDF

to develop its human resources and strengthen its
capabilities, as described above. While working under
various constraints and making great effort to prevent
accidents and address other safety concerns, the SDF
is committed to educating its personnel and training GSDF personnel conducting shooting training in the snow
its units to make them strong, and to maintaining and
improving its readiness to respond to any situation.

**1. Education of SDF Regular Personnel**

**(1) Present Status of Education**
Enhancing the ability of each SDF Regular Personnel is essential to the SDF to perform their duties at units. At
its schools and training units, the SDF provides a systematic phased education, starting from basic education
immediately after joining the SDF, to life-long learning to nurture the qualities necessary for positions and duties,
in order to cultivate quality, knowledge and skills of personnel.

When it is judged that personnel need to improve their professional knowledge and skills, or if it is difficult

for them to acquire such knowledge and skills within the SDF, they may study abroad, at external educational
institutions[12], domestic companies, research institutes, and similar organizations. Education is entrusted to such
organizations, and so a wide range of external educational organizations is used to help personnel continuously
improve their qualifications, knowledge and skills. (See Reference 66)


-----

**(2) Joint Educational Programs**
The joint operations posture was started in March 2006. Knowledge and skills regarding joint operations are
essential in order to develop the system, which is done primarily through joint educational programs. Therefore,
the SDF has enhanced education on joint operations at the Staff College[13] of each force, and at other educational
facilities. Additionally, a joint educational program system, centered on the Joint Staff College[14], has been set up.
High-ranking SDF officers who will become Senior Unit Commanders and Senior Staff receive joint educational
programs at this College.

**(3) Educational Programs Meeting the Needs of the Times**
The SDF has increasing opportunities to take part in international activities, and is developing more active
relationships with other countries, and so has added language programs for English, Russian, Chinese, Korean,
Arabic, and other languages to its curricula. The SDF also accepts students from abroad to increase understanding
of other countries. Furthermore, education on the implementation of international peace cooperation activities
is being carried out in the GSDF International Activities Training Unit and other groups in order to conduct
international peace cooperation activities in an expeditious and continuous manner. (See Chapter 3, Section 1)
(See Reference 67-68)

**2. SDF Training**

**(1) Training by Each Self-Defense Force**
There are two main types of training within units in the GSDF, MSDF, and ASDF: training for individual SDF
personnel to improve their proficiency in respective fields, and training for units to conduct systematic operations.

Training for individuals is conducted one-on-one in stages based on occupational classification and individual

ability. Training for units is conducted by size of unit, from small to large, and large-scale comprehensive training
is also carried out to ensure that overall abilities can be exercised. (See Reference 69)

In addition to such training for national defense, training is given on the diverse roles required for the SDF

in recent years. (See Reference 70)

**(2) Joint Exercise**
In order to exert defense capabilities most effectively in the event of an armed attack on Japan, the GSDF, MSDF,
and ASDF must conduct joint exercise during peacetime. Therefore, the SDF has been conducting joint exercise
involving two or more forces. Such joint exercise has been strengthened with the transition to a joint operations
posture in March 2006[15]. (See Reference 69)

**(3) Restrictions on Education and Training, and Responses**
Various facilities and equipment[16] are available for SDF training under the nearest possible environment to that
of real fighting, yet many restrictions are imposed on their usage.

Particularly, restrictions[17] in maneuver areas, waters and airspace, and firing ranges where training is carried

out are becoming tighter along with the modernization of equipment and other changes. Such areas are not
sufficient in size, are unevenly dispersed across the nation, and have time limitations.

Furthermore, training under an electronic warfare[18] environment – conducted as practical training – is limited

by the need to avoid radio wave interference.

To deal with these restrictions, each SDF makes maximum use of its limited domestic maneuvering areas.

They also strive to carry out more practical training by conducing live-firing training and Japan-U.S. joint
exercises in the United States and waters off the United States where there are training conditions not available
in Japan. (See Reference 71)


-----

**(4) Safety Management**
Because the primary mission of the SDF is to defend Japan, SDF training and activities are inevitably accompanied
by risk. However, accidents that cause injury or loss of property to the public or the loss of life of SDF personnel
must be avoided at all costs.

Continuous safety reviews and improvements are vital, and must be jointly handled by the Ministry of

Defense and the SDF. The Ministry of Defense and the SDF take great care to ensure the safety of military
vessel and aircraft traffic, and firing training at ordinary times, and prepare aeronautical safety radio facilities and
equipment for prevention and rescue in the event of marine accidents.

**(5) The Collision between the Destroyer Atago and the Fishing Vessel Seitoku Maru**
The MSDF destroyer was one party in the collision on 19 February 2008 between the destroyer Atago and the
fishing vessel _Seitoku Maru, causing the capsizing of the_ _Seitoku Maru with its crew of two. It is extremely_
regrettable that the SDF, which is responsible for defending the lives and property of the Japanese people, caused
such an accident and the SDF maintains an awareness of the extreme importance of this issue.

An “MSDF Accident Investigation Commission” was established immediately following the incident to

investigate its causes. On 21 March 2008 the findings of the investigation until that point were made public to the
extent that such disclosure would not hinder the investigation. The following evaluations were provided of the
total response extended by the Atago[19]:
1) The watch conditions for the ship as a whole were not performed adequately. This includes the placement of

watch personnel and the CIC person on duty.
2) The fact that the _Seitoku Maru was observed at starboard means that it is highly likely the_ _Seitoku Maru_

approached the starboard side of the Atago. If this is the case, the Atago had an obligation to give-way but
failed to implement appropriate give-way maneuvers. Furthermore, it is highly possible that the measures
implemented by the Atago immediately preceding the collision were inadequate avoidance maneuvers.

The MOD and SDF will continue to perform investigations, make efforts to create more detailed responses,

and work to prevent the recurrence of such accidents.

Safety in maritime navigation is of utmost importance, whether for SDF ships or general vessels. The general

rules for maritime traffic safety outlined in the Law for the Prevention of Collision at Sea and in the Maritime
Traffic Safety Law for designated waters apply to SDF ships in exactly the same way as they apply to general
maritime vessels. Education and training on this matter are currently being provided.

The conditions of the Atago at the time of the accident and the accident cause will be made clear by a Japan

Coast Guard investigation and by accident investigations by a marine accident inquiry and by MOD Marine
Vessel Accident Investigation Committee. Emergency measures implemented due to this accident include the
following:
1) On the day of the accident the Minister of Defense issued instructions (“The Safe Navigation of Military

Vessels”) to the head of the unit operating military vessels to reconfirm and educate personnel on (a) compliance
and adherence with laws and regulations on the securing of safety in maritime traffic and (b) the operational
system for safe navigation.
2) Based on these Ministerial instructions, on 28 and 29 February the MSDF ceased all training and operations,

excluding critical unit operations on actual duty, and implemented a “General Review on Operational Safety”
for aircraft as well as military vessels that included a safety review of operational preparedness with such
elements as a review of duty readiness and watch-related conditions.
3) Regarding the use of the autopilot until immediately before the accident, instructions have been issued for an

investigation to establish internal autopilot regulations and to make as clear as possible for all situations upon
whose authority the decision for autopilot use is made. Furthermore, from 25 February, with the exception of
multi-purpose assistance vessels with restrictions on staffing for operations, the use of autopilot functions by


-----

individual vessels of the SDF fleet during regular operations was prohibited until said internal regulations are
established.

Further developments include the following:
1) A decision was made to establish universal operating standards for autopilot equipment in the MSDF in order

to achieve a standardized autopilot operation.
2) Audio recordings from voice recorders and the navigational record of ships as detected by radar are valuable

for the investigation and analysis following accidents such as this one. As such, a decision was made to
proceed with investigations into installing equipment and/or functions capable of continuously recording such
information, and to equip automatic audio and radar course recording functions.
3) Following the _Nadashio Submarine incident, improvements were made to the content of year-round basic_

training implemented annually to improve basic skills for operational safety.

The accident was first reported to the Minister of Defense at 5:40 a.m., more than one-and-one-half hours

after the accident, and first reported to the Prime Minister at approximately 6:00 a.m., nearly two hours after the
accident. It must be noted that reporting was delayed.

The fact that an extended period of time passed between the accident and the accident being reported to the

Prime Minister and the Minister of Defense indicates an incredibly serious weakness of the crisis management
response.

As a result of these conditions, the instruction for reporting incidents and accidents was immediately revised

to make it clear that notification for important incidents and/or accidents is to be provided by individual Chiefs
of Staff to their direct Ministers and Senior Vice-Ministers within one hour. Furthermore, in March the existing
instructions were radically revised and new instructions were issued for the prompt reporting of emergency
situations in order to improve reporting to 1) the Minister of Defense and others, 2) the Prime Minister’s Office,
and 3) to prefectures and municipalities. In addition, revisions such as the following were made: 1) conditions that
require prompt reporting are not only SDF incidents and/or accidents, but are expanded to include all emergency
situations, and “emergency situation” is to be indicated in detail; 2) a report to the Prime Minister’s Office is to
be made without fail and the point of contact is to be made clear; and 3) a description will be provided of new
reports to be made to concerned prefectures and municipalities.

**4. Working Conditions of Personnel, Measures on Personnel Matters, and Other Related**

**Issues**

The duties of the SDF make no distinction between night and day. The work assigned to SDF Regular Personnel
can be extremely demanding, involving various operations onboard aircraft, long-term service on ships or
submarines, or parachuting. To instill SDF personnel with pride and allow them to concentrate on their duties
without anxiety, the Ministry of Defense and the SDF strive to provide salaries and allowances, medical care,
health and welfare, and benefits that reflect the special nature of their duties. (See Fig. III-4-1-4)

**1. The Panel to Examine Comprehensive Reform in the Personnel Field of the Defense Force**
The Ministry of Defense has acknowledged the significance of maintaining high-quality human resources, and
has implemented various measures for the new era[20]. Given the rapidly declining birth rate in recent years and
changes in lifecycles of SDF personnel, a wide range of reforms, which focus on the personnel field of the Defense
Force, has become a pressing issue, in order to secure sufficient human resources and create a comfortable
working environment where personnel can concentrate on their duties without anxiety. In September 2006, the
Panel to Examine Comprehensive Reforms in the Personnel Field of the Defense Force was established. The
panel is headed by the Minister of State for Defense (at the time), and includes top officials of the Defense
Agency (at the time) and outside experts. Under their authority the panel has implemented various types of

It has implemented various measures.  In 2006, the headquarters drew up the Basic Plan for Gender Equality in the Defense Agency and made other decisions to promote: the expansion in the recruitment and employment of female personnel, support for female personnel to balance work and family life, the improvement of facilities and accommodation on ships and other work areas to fit situations where more and more female personnel are being placed.|Gender-Equal Society Law (1999)1|
|Promotion of Measures to Support the Development of the Next Generation| The Defense Agency Committee for the Promotion of Measures to Support the Development of the Next Generation was established.  The Defense Agency drew up the Action Plan of the Defense Agency as a specific business proprietor. (In particular, encouraging male personnel to take child-care leave and special leave, and establishing day care centers on the premises of the Ministry of Defense and SDF).|Law for Measures to Support the Development of the Next Generation (2003)2|
|Approaches to Mental Health| After its establishment in 2003, the Defense Agency Headquarters for the Prevention of Suicide has discussed measures to prevent suicide and distributed referential materials on suicide prevention to garrisons and bases.  Efforts to enhance awareness among SDF personnel have been made through improvement in the counseling system, and the production and dissemination of educational videos.  In relation to mental health, measures on Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder and Critical Incident Stress have been deliberated.||
|Active Utilization of Warrant Officers and Enlisted Personnel| The GSDF, MSDF, and ASDF have assigned Warrant Officers and senior enlisted personnel new roles, including giving instruction on service discipline to enlisted personnel. For example, the MSDF introduced the Command Master Chief System in April 2003, while the GSDF introduced the Master Sergeant Major System from 2006, and the ASDF introduced the Command Master System on a trial basis since April of this year.||
|The Comprehensive Reform in the Personnel Field| The Panel to Examine Comprehensive Reform in the Personnel Field of the Defense Force was established in September 2006 with the Defense Agency Chief then as the chairman. They created reports on recruitment, items during one’s tenure, measures taken for backup and after one’s retirement, and on other items.  In addition, the Panel to Implement Measures for the Comprehensive Reform in the Personnel Field of the Defense Force was established last August with the Senior Vice-Minister of Defense as the chairman. They have steadily implemented the content of their report.||

In June 2007, the panel produced a report[21] of its findings compiled in the following categories: “Recruitment

Items,” “Service Period Items,” “Items on Measures for Aid and Post-Retirement,” and “Other Items.”

Furthermore, on 7 August 2007, the “Panel to Implement Measures for the Comprehensive Reform in the

Personnel Field of the Defense Force[22],” headed by the Senior Vice-Minister of Defense was established, and this
panel is working for the steady implementation of these reforms.

**2. Efforts to Prevent Suicide among SDF Personnel**
In 1998, the annual number of suicides in Japan exceeded 30,000 and has since maintained a high level. This is
a serious social problem in Japan. The same is true for the SDF, with a record-setting 94 SDF personnel suicides
in FY 2004, 93 suicides in FY 2005 and FY 2006, and 83 suicides in FY 2007.

The suicide of any SDF personnel is truly a great tragedy for both the suicides themselves and their bereaved

families, and it is also a great loss for the SDF to lose capable personnel. The Ministry of Defense established,
in July 2003, the Defense Agency Headquarters for the Prevention of Suicides (at the time), headed by the
Parliamentary Secretary for Defense (at the time), and took the following measures to prevent suicide. Much
effort will be continued to be made for the prevention of suicide.
1) Expanding the counseling system (inside counselors, outside counselors, mental health care officers, and a

24-hour telephone hotline for counseling).
2) Promoting education, to ensure that commanders feel signs of mental problems among subordinates, and that

general personnel are aware of their own mental health.
3) Setting a campaign period for the good mental health in spring and summer, which is when personnel are

transferred, to enhance awareness of mental health, which includes: having commanders closely monitor the
mental condition of subordinates whose environment has been changed due to personnel transfer, providing
various reference materials and providing lectures.

**3. Commemorating Personnel Killed in the Line of Duty**
Since the establishment of the National Police Reserve in 1950, which has evolved through the National Safety
Force and the Coastal Safety Force into the SDF today, SDF personnel have been striving to accomplish the
noble mission of protecting the peace and independence of Japan. They have accomplished this by devoting
themselves unstintingly to training, day and night, to
live up to the expectations and trust of the Japanese
citizens, regardless of danger, and with a strong sense
of responsibility. During this time, however, more than
1,700 personnel have lost their lives in the line of duty.

In the Ministry of Defense and the SDF, funeral

ceremonies are carried out by each SDF unit, to which
the personnel killed in the line of duty belonged, in
order to express condolences to them. Moreover, in
order to eternally recognize the achievements of the
SDF personnel killed in the line of duty, and to express
deep honor and condolences, memorial ceremonies are

the families of the deceased[23].

**5. Retirement and Outplacement of Personnel, and Related Issues**

**1. Retirement and Outplacement of Personnel**
There is an early retirement system and a short-term service system for SDF Regular Personnel, to keep the
forces strong. Unlike general civilian government employees, many SDF Regular Personnel retire by their mid50s (personnel serving under the early retirement system) and their 20s (most uniformed personnel serving under
the short-term service system).

To resolve concerns that SDF Regular Personnel may have about their future, it is essential to ensure that


-----

they can lead a stable life after retirement, and thus can work diligently with peace of mind while in service. Such
treatment also boosts morale and makes it easier to attract high-quality human resources.

For these reasons, the Ministry of Defense places great importance on outplacement measures for retiring

SDF Regular Personnel in personnel matters, and assists outplacement, such as by providing occupational
training to teach useful skills, and by effectively using employment information[24].

Various local organizations help retiring SDF personnel find new jobs. On the other hand, since the Ministry

of Defense is not authorized to conduct employment placement services itself, the SDF Assistance Foundation
– with the permission of the Minister of Health, Labour and Welfare, and the Minister of Land, Infrastructure and
Transport – offers free employment placement services. As the job market is expected to remain tight, assistance
from local governments and other organizations is also becoming increasingly necessary.

Retired Regular Personnel of the SDF work in various sectors, including the manufacturing and service

industries, and are now increasingly being employed as risk management staff, including disaster prevention, by
local public organizations. Retired SDF personnel are highly evaluated by their employers because they generally
have an excellent sense of responsibility, diligence, physical strength, spirit, discipline and other qualities. In
particular, those retired or reaching mandatory retirement age have great leadership skills cultivated through
many years of service. (See Fig. III-4-1-5)

**Fig. III-4-1-5 Main Measures for Reemployment Support**

|Item|Description|
|---|---|
|Occupational aptitude testing| Testing aimed to provide guidance on the basis of individual aptitudes|
|Technical training| Provide transferable technical skills for use after retirement (e.g. heavy-duty/special-purpose vehicle operation, information processing skills, crane operation, vehicle maintenance, boiler operation, handling dangerous materials)|
|Driver training| Grant heavy-duty vehicle license|
|Disaster prevention and risk control training| Provide technical knowledge on disaster prevention administration and the Civil Protection Plan|
|Correspondence courses| Provide capabilities to obtain official certification (e.g. social insurance officer, health manager, real estate business manager) to SDF Regular Personnel that will take mandatory retirement|
|Business management training| Enlighten SDF Regular Personnel that will take mandatory retirement so that they foster social adaptability. Also provide know-how to lead a stable life after retirement or reemployment|
|Career guidance| Prepare near-retiree SDF Regular Personnel to find new employment and provide them with know-how to choose new occupation|



**2. Regulations on Outplacement of Personnel after Retirement**
There are restrictions on the outplacement of SDF Regular Personnel to ensure impartiality in public duties.
For example, within the first two years after a person leaves the SDF, if the prospective employer is a private
company that had a contract with the Ministry of Defense within five years before said person leaves the SDF,
then the approval[25] of the Minister of Defense or other regulated personnel is required. In 2007, the Minister
of Defense approved 99 individual cases (99 persons) of reemployment of SDF Regular Personnel at private
companies.


-----

**3. Reappointment System**
The reappointment system allows the reemployment of personnel who have the desire and capabilities to
continue working as SDF personnel after they reach the retirement age. The system makes the best possible use
of experienced and valuable human resources, and secures the linkage between employment and pension. Under
this system, the Ministry of Defense and the SDF have reappointed 236 personnel as of the end of March 2008.
Furthermore, from the standpoint of building an environment for SDF Regular Personnel, who reach retirement
earlier than general civilian government employees to focus on their duties with a sense of security, there are
plans to revise the Reappoint System from the existing appointment within one year to make appointments
possible within three years when under 60 years of age. (See Fig. III-4-1-6)

**Fig. III-4-1-6 Overview of Reappointment System**

|Item|Administrative officials and others|SDF regular personnel|
|---|---|---|
|Basic approach| Present mandatory retirement age to remain in place; personnel in their early 60s who have the ability and desire to work in the public service to be reappointed| While maintaining present mandatory retirement age, personnel with the desire and ability to work as SDF regular personnel beyond the mandatory retirement age remains to be appointed to a position determined by the Minister of Defense|
|Job conditions| Full-time  Shorter-time service| Limited to full-time service|
|Period of reappointment| One year, with renewal allowed| Renewal is allowed within one year (term for personnel under 60 is intended to be within three years). Extension is allowed  Extension is allowed for a certain period of time (between six months to a year) in the case of mobilization|
|Maximum age for reappointment| 65 (Maximum age was 61 between FY 2001 to FY 2003. Subsequently, the age has been increased incrementally by one year, every three years)||
|Salary and allowance| Fixed monthly salary is provided based on job level and rank. Allowances, such as a commuting allowance, are provided||



**6. Enhancing Information and Communications Capabilities**
Information and communication are the basis for command and control, extending from the central command to
respective headquarters, and to the lower units. It is like the central nervous system of the Ministry of Defense
and the SDF. Therefore, the Ministry of Defense and the SDF recognize the importance of enhancing information
and communication capabilities in related fields that are directly related to the capabilities of the SDF to execute
missions.

**1. Response to the Information Technology (IT) Revolution**
In response to the IT revolution of recent years, the Ministry of Defense and the SDF are pursuing information
superiority[26], and are systematically establishing the infrastructure to integrate their defense capabilities in order
to enable efficient operations. The following three core measures have been taken: 1) Developing sophisticated
networks, including the Defense Information Infrastructure (DII) or Common Operating Environment (COE);
2) Enhancing information and communications functions, such as the Central Command System (CCS) and the


-----

command system of the GSDF, MSDF, and ASDF[27]; and 3) Assuring information security, such as responding to
cyber attacks against the Ministry of Defense and the SDF.

**2. Future Policy for Information and Communications (Action Plan)**
In order to meet the new operational needs expected of the SDF in the future, it is necessary to develop more
varied and flexible information and communications systems. Our policy targets for strengthening command and
communications capabilities and related capabilities have already been set[28].

As a result, DII has been proceeding with construction of an enhanced information and communications

posture in response to state-of-the-art information and communications technologies at home and overseas.
In addition, the enhancement of capabilities for responses to cyber and other attacks is being sought by the
introduction of protective equipment and the development of response readiness. (See Fig. III-4-1-7) (See Part
II, Chapter 2, Section 4)

**7. Enhancement of Technical Research & Development**

**1. Research & Development of the Technical Research & Development Institute (TRDI)**
In the Ministry of Defense, strict financial circumstances make it necessary to select and concentrate research
programs (e.g. by sharing works with the private sector, focusing on fields of our country’s superiority, etc.). TRDI
implemented a medium-to-long-term technology outlook which determined the vision on priority technology
areas and clarified future directions for each technology area[29].


-----

In addition, it has become necessary to introduce emerging technologies into R&D, and to conduct deeper

analysis on operational needs. For these purposes, a number of new R&D methods are being adopted[30].

In order to optimize the performance, schedule and cost throughout the lifecycle of equipment or materials,

it is effective to thoroughly conduct trade-off analyses on a number of proposals regarding performance and cost
at the point of concept creation or R&D. Additionally, it is effective to follow-up for improvements and other
necessary measures, after deployment of equipment and materials. Continuous study is underway as part of
efforts to enhance the R&D system. (See Reference 72-73)

**2. Strengthening Relations with the Commercial-off-the-Shelf (COTS) Technology Field**
In regard to R&D at the Ministry of Defense, the National Defense Program Guidelines and the Mid-Term
Defense Program state that efforts should be made “by proactively introducing advanced technology of industrial,
governmental, and academic sectors.”

TRDI aims to investigate and introduce superior technologies in the private sector. As part of this effort,

basic (element) technology research themes have been selected, and investigation and research projects that
invite public participation by not only private corporations, but
also various research organizations, were newly introduced from
FY 2007. Implementation of such projects is intended to push
forward introduction of superior technology from a wide range of
organizations, including research organizations and corporations
without direct past contact with the Ministry of Defense.

It is also important to spread the outcome of R&D at the

Ministry of Defense into the private sectors. The Ministry of
Defense is cooperating to promote the conversion of aircraft that
have been developed as SDF aircraft for civil use, since this may
lead to a reduction in the procurement costs of such aircraft. The
Ministry of Defense is cooperating with other related ministries
and agencies through the Council of Ministries and Agencies
Related to Promotion of Development of Civil Aircrafts[31].

**Technical Research & Development Institute (TRDI)**

I am working as a director of the research office
responsible for upgrading and evaluating the combat
vehicle systems.

Right now, we are involved in the technical

tests for the new tank. Technical tests are conducted
to verify that the prototype has all the necessary
functions. After passing that test, the prototype
undergoes a service trial at the camp, based on which
its adoption or rejection will be decided.

The tank is powerful equipment that combines three

functions – firepower, mobility and protection – in a Dr. Shimura conducting technical training

highly systemized manner. Accordingly, there are many
aspects that need to be evaluated. This new tank will
have an enhanced information and telecommunication
function in addition to the three functions mentioned
above. As a cutting-edge IT tank equipped with the
latest features, it requires very precise testing.

Tests are conducted by a test team, which consists

mainly of research officials and is supported by some
GSDF personnel. Since the performance must be
tested from all technical perspectives, we also consult
technical staff from other research offices internally

A new tank in the research and development stage

or externally, as necessary. Because the tests must
be conducted within the GSDF camps or TRDI test
centers, we have to make an official tour for days. Preparation and data collection before and after the tour are
as important as the actual test, since no accurate evaluation can be expected without thorough preparation and
arrangement of data. Therefore, I would like to concentrate on one test. Nevertheless, I always have difficulty
finding enough personnel to accomplish the mission since multiple tests are going on at all times.

As a director tasked with management, I am no longer involved in as many tests as I used to be when

I was a researcher. Nevertheless, in FY 2007 I directed two tests as the head of a test team. One of them,
which was conducted at Kamifurano Camp, involved hitting a moving object while driving the vehicle. This
is one of the highest technical tests, and the severe cold and heavy snow at the camp made the task all the
more difficult. When we saw bullet marks near the center of the target, we were amazed at the capability of
the new tank. At the same time, we felt rewarded and proud that our test was successful.

The tests for the new tank will continue until FY 2009. Although busy days are expected to continue,

we as a team would like to make efforts to ensure that the new tank adopted by the GSDF will perform
flawlessly as a critical part of the future ground defense systems.

Section 2. Interaction between the Ministry of Defense & the SDF, and the Local

Community & Japanese Citizens

As stated at the beginning of this chapter, the various activities of the Ministry of Defense and the SDF cannot
be carried out by the Ministry of Defense and the SDF alone. They are only possible with the understanding and
cooperation of each and every citizen, local governments and other organizations.

In addition to the details explained in Section 1 of this chapter, the SDF is executing its duties with support

and cooperation from the local communities and the Japanese people in a variety of forms. Likewise, the SDF has
been making various cooperation activities to support the people’s lives. Such activities are further deepening the
mutual trust between the local community and the people, and the SDF, not only contributing to the enhancement
and strengthening of the foundation of defense bases, but also instilling a sense of pride and self-confidence in
SDF personnel.

To ensure full function of defense facilities[32], it is necessary to maintain a state of stable use by securing

harmony with the local communities, and gaining the understanding and cooperation of local residents surrounding
defense facilities. For this reason, the Ministry of Defense and the SDF strive to minimize the impact of the
presence and operation of defense facilities on the daily lives of local residents through various measures.

This section explains the daily interaction between the Defense Ministry and the SDF and the local

communities, and activities undertaken to gain public understanding and cooperation.

**1. Cooperation from Local Public Organizations and Other Related Organizations for the**

**SDF**

**1. Cooperation in Recruitment of SDF Regular Personnel and Support for Outplacement**
As stated in the previous section, under the severe recruitment environment and employment situation, the
cooperation of local public organizations and relevant organizations is vital to secure highly qualified personnel
and to assist the outplacement of SDF Regular Personnel who retire at a relatively young age. (See Section 1-2)

**2. Support for SDF Activities**
SDF camps and bases are located in all prefectures, and maintain close relations with the local communities.
Various forms of cooperation and support from the local communities are indispensable for the SDF to conduct
diverse activities. The SDF has also received words of encouragement from the people including local residents
and relevant organizations.

In addition to this kind of support and cooperation from the local communities, many letters of encouragement

are sent by the people to personnel engaging in international peace cooperation activities which raise the morale
of personnel and reinforce their awareness of serving the people of Japan.

**2. Activities in Civic Life and Contributions to**

**Society**

The SDF is carrying out support activities for residents in a
number of fields linked with the people, based on requests from
local governments and relevant organizations, in addition to
its role set forth in the National Defense Program Guidelines.
For example, the SDF worked with relevant organizations to
provide transport support for VIPs, surveillance and guarding
at SDF camps at the G8 Hokkaido Toyako Summit from 7-9 GSDF special transport helicopter EC-225LP transports Prime Minister Fukuda to the 2008 G8 Hokkaido Toyako Summit (July 2008)


-----

July this year. These activities have deepened the mutual trust between the SDF and the people and contributed to
expanding and strengthening the foundation of national defense. They also give SDF personnel a sense of pride
and confidence in their constant contribution to the lives of the people. (See Reference 74-75)

**3. Harmony between Defense Facilities and the Local Community, and Environmental**

**Conservation**

**1. Scale and Features of Defense Facilities**
The uses of defense facilities can be extended in various ways such as maneuver areas, airfields, ports and
barracks[33]. Many defense facilities, including airfields and maneuver areas, require large areas of land. Due to
Japan’s geographical characteristics, there are some cities and industrial facilities that must compete with defense
facilities on narrow plains. In particular, problems related to restricted presence and operations of defense facilities
have emerged due to the urbanization of areas around many defense facilities as a result of economic development.
Also, noise related to frequent takeoffs and landings by aircraft, firing, bombing, gunshots from artillery, tank
operations and so on, raise concern in the affected residential communities. (See Figs. III-4-2-1, III-4-2-2)

**2. Defense Facility Issues and Various Measures**
Defense facilities, as bases which support the defense capabilities of Japan and the Japan-U.S. Security
Arrangements, are indispensable to the country’s security, and maintaining continuous and stable use of them is
necessary. For that reason, the Ministry of Defense has been securing harmony between the defense facilities and
surrounding areas, and working to obtain the understanding and cooperation of the local residents by taking the
measures shown in Fig. III-4-2-3.

In order to publicize one of these measures, the North Kanto Defense Bureau invited elementary school

children residing in the area surrounding the ASDF Hyakuri Base to create pictures titled “Friends and family
playing in schools and parks improved by subsidies related to soundproof construction and public welfare
facilities.” Such pictures were exhibited in April this year. (See Reference 76)

The Ministry of Defense has put priority on improving the living environment around airfields, including

providing subsidies for residential sound insulation. However, some residents have filed lawsuits concerning
noise damage and others[34].

Under such situation, the Ministry of Defense established the Council for the Improvement of the Living

Environment around Airfields comprised of external
experts in 2001, to discuss future measures. The council
subsequently compiled a report the following year[35].

With regard to measures for improving the living

environment such as subsidies for residential sound
insulation, the Ministry of Defense is making efforts
to grasp the status of the noise in areas surrounding
defense facilities, appropriately review target areas for
sound insulation in consideration of the actual status
and expand new measures based on the proposals
incorporated in the report by the council. (See Figs.
III-4-2- 3, 4, 5) (See Reference 77)

Improvements to Hamura city road route 201 were conducted as part of
measures to reduce the burden of residents around the base

**3. Environmental Conservation**
As a part of the government, the Ministry of Defense has been developing implementation plans based on a
variety of government plans to proactively promote various efforts for environmental conservation[36].

In 2001 the Ministry of Defense Environment Month and Week were established, during which camps

throughout the country carried out events for the purpose of environmental conservation, such as prevention of
global warming, and enhancing a sense of environmental awareness by SDF personnel.

In maintaining its facilities and equipment, the SDF is promoting diverse efforts[37] to ensure environmental

conservation and decrease the environmental burden.


-----

**4. Base of Defense Administration in Regional Areas**
The relationship between the Ministry of Defense and local communities is increasing its importance.
Consequently, the local branch offices of the Defense Facilities Administration Agency (the Defense Facilities
Administration Bureaus) and the regional organizations of the Equipment Procurement Office were unified at
the time of the disbandment and integration of the Defense Facilities Administration Agency, and the Regional
Defense Bureaus were established as the local branch offices of the Ministry of Defense to create a base for
comprehensive defense administration in regional areas, including coordination and consultation with local
governments and municipalities related to defense policies.

While succeeding the roles that the Defense Facilities Administration Bureau and the Equipment Procurement

Office local branches had played, the Regional Defense Bureaus are making explanations to the local communities
of the policies of the Ministry of Defense and the reorganization of the U.S. Forces (as work to ensure local
cooperation to obtain the understanding and cooperation of local governments and residents), and implementing
various policies such as local coordination in line with the improvement of defense facilities in order to smoothly
and effectively implement the overall administrative works of the Ministry of Defense.

**4. Public Relations Activities, Information Disclosure, and Related Activities**
The activities of the Ministry of Defense and the SDF to protect the peace and security of Japan can not be carried
out without the understanding and support of the people of Japan toward the Ministry of Defense and the SDF.
For this reason, the Ministry of Defense and the SDF, have been making efforts to provide them with information
through active public relations activities, etc. from the perspective of increasing the public attention to national
defense and accountability to the public.

See <http://www.mod.go.jp/menu/kohokatudo.html>

**1. Various Public Relations Activities**
As the scope of SDF activities has expanded both domestically and internationally, including international
peace cooperation activities such as the replenishment support activities in the Indian Ocean and disaster relief
dispatches, the public attention[39] to the SDF and defense issues has been increasing.

With the recognition that it is necessary to proactively promote publicity on defense policies and SDF

activities on a regular basis, the Ministry of Defense and the SDF employ a variety of PR activities to ensure
better understanding about the current status of the SDF in consideration of the changing public awareness and
needs as well as for increasing overseas attention to the Ministry of Defense and the SDF.

**(1) Website (http://www.mod.go.jp), Pamphlets and Others**
The Ministry of Defense and the SDF conduct PR activities using a wide variety of media, including providing
information and gathering public opinions and supplying PR videos via the internet, and displaying commercial
films for each SDF service on large outdoor screens.

The Ministry of Defense has been making efforts to provide accurate information on the SDF and the national

defense more extensively to the public, in the form of creation and distribution of various pamphlets which
explain the policies of the Ministry of Defense and the activities of the SDF, cooperation for media coverage, and
assistance in editing the PR magazine “MAMOR.” Furthermore, as the SDF activities overseas have increased,
oversea attention to the Ministry of Defense and the SDF has been enhanced. In order to address such situation,
the Ministry of Defense is making efforts including publishing the English language quarterly newsletter “Japan
Defense Focus”, promoting participation of foreign media in regular press conferences, expanding the English
section of the Ministry of Defense website, creation of defense white papers, various policy pamphlets and PR
videos in English.


-----

In addition to these efforts, regarding measures such as the replenishment support activities and so on of the

Maritime Self-Defense Force in the Indian Ocean, etc. which has particularly attracted public attention, intensive
publicity has been carried out through channels such as the Ministry of Defense website, special features in the
PR magazine, videos, pamphlets, and the seminars on defense issues organized by Regional Defense Bureaus.

**(2) Events, PR Facilities, etc.[40]**

The Ministry of Defense and the SDF conduct activities
to extensively inform the people of the current status
of the SDF. These activities include the annual GSDF
Comprehensive Fire Power Exercise conducted at the
base of Mt. Fuji; cruises for experience by vessels of
the MSDF in each region; and demonstration flights and
boarding experience on aircraft at open base festivals
held at ASDF bases. In addition, at camps and bases
throughout the country, events including equipment
exhibitions, unit tours and SDF band concerts are held on
the anniversary of a unit’s foundation, etc. Furthermore,
in commemoration of the anniversary of the foundation Former Parliamentary Secretary for Defense Terada presents a bouquet to the

200,000th Ichigayadai Tour participant

of the SDF, events such as a SDF Marching Festival, a
troop review, a fleet review, and an air review are held.

Last year’s SDF Marching Festival was held at the Nippon Budokan attracting a total audience of approximately

40,000. Concerning annual reviews by the SDF, the troop review, fleet review and air review are hosted in rotation
by the GSDF, MSDF and ASDF at which the SDF equipment and exercises are exhibited to the public. Last year,
the GSDF held a troop review, which was attended by approximately 42,000 people, including rehearsals. This
year, an air review by the ASDF is planned.

In addition to such events, the Ministry of Defense and the SDF actively promote tours at PR facilities. For

example, some facilities in the Defense Ministry at Ichigaya are open to visitors on two guided tours each weekday;
one each in the morning and afternoon. Since the tours were launched in June 2000, more than 200,000 people
have visited the facilities so far. Each SDF service also has established PR facilities which people can visit free of
charge, and camps and bases across Japan have PR stations and history museums open to the public. (See Reference
at the end of the book)

**(3) Enlistment Experience Programs[41]**

The SDF offers enlistment experience programs for employees at the request of private companies to provide
opportunities to experience the daily life and training of the SDF member by staying at an SDF camp or base for
two to three days. In the last fiscal year, the SDF held approximately 1,100 programs which were participated by
approximately 21,100 people. Tours of enlistment experiences for the youth, college students and women are also
conducted[42].

**2. Appropriate Operation of the Information Disclosure System[43] and Personal Data Protection System[44]**

An information disclosure system was established in the Ministry of Defense, in line with the enactment of the
Act on Access to Information Held by Administrative Organs in 2001. Based on this legislation, the Ministry of
Defense discloses administrative documents under its jurisdiction upon request. A personal information protection
system (in MOD) was also established in line with the Law for the Protection of Personal Information Held by
Administrative Organs of 2005. Along with measures to ensure the security of the personal information under its
jurisdiction, the Defense Ministry also discloses such information based on this law in response to requests for
disclosure, revision and termination of use.

For this reason, the receipt and implementation of disclosure applications will be instigated at the Ministry of

Defense offices (Shinjuku Ward, Tokyo) and each Regional Defense Bureau and branch.

See <http://www.mod.go.jp/j/info/joho/johokokai06.pdf> (See Reference 79)

**3. Appropriate Operation of the Whistle-Blower Protection System[45]**

In recent years, workers within corporations have contributed to revealing various corporate scandals, which
have threatened the peace of mind and security of the peoples’ daily life. In order to develop a safeguard system
to protect workers who disclose information, the Whistle-Blower Protection Act entered into effect in April
2006.

In accordance with this act, the Defense Ministry set up a system to handle public interest-related information

disclosures by MOD employees and outside workers on issues where the Defense Ministry has the legal authority
to punish or issue recommendations. Moreover, the Ministry of Defense and the SDF have established an internal
contact desk for information disclosure in the public interest by MOD employees, and an external contact desk
for related disclosure by outside workers. Through the contact desks, the Defense Ministry deals with information
disclosure that is in the public interest and whistle-blower protection.

**4. Engagement in Policy Evaluation[46]**

In 2001, a system to evaluate government policies was introduced with the aim of improving the efficiency and
quality of administration in the public’s best interest, while the Government Policy Evaluations Act (GPEA)
entered into effect in 2002.

Based on these plans, the Ministry of Defense is evaluating various policies designated to achieve the

objectives of the Defense Ministry and the SDF: to ensure the peace and independence of Japan and the security
of the state. These evaluations involve analysis from diverse perspectives, such as domestic and overseas
circumstances and technological innovation trends using a comprehensive evaluation system.

In FY 2007, 49 policy evaluations were performed beginning with the “ideal format of the Ministry of

Defense’s audiovisual publicity.”

the Mid-Term Defense Program. Also see Chapter 2 of Part I for details on the National Defense Program
Guidelines and the Mid-Term Defense Program
2) The “Ministry of Defense” and the “Self-Defense Forces (SDF)” are the same governmental organization
for defense. The “Ministry of Defense” is used to refer to the governmental organization responsible for the
administration and operations of the GSDF, MSDF and ASDF, whereas the “SDF” is used to refer to the
armed organization operating in units that is responsible for the defense of Japan.

6) Until FY 2006, there were two systems applied to employment of SDF Regular Personnel who are 18 years
old or over and under 27 years of age (under 24 years of age for Student Candidates for Enlisted (Upper)
System) as candidates for “enlisted (upper)”: the “Student Candidate for Enlisted (Upper) System” and the
“Enlisted (Upper) Candidate System.” In recruitment from FY 2007, the two systems were reorganized and
unified into a new appointment system. It adopts some elements of the “Enlisted (Upper) System,” which
aims to raise awareness of candidates for the Enlisted (Upper), and the “Candidates for the Enlisted (Upper)
System,” which emphasizes individual capabilities in personnel management. Those qualified for SDF
Regular Personnel are recruited as “General Candidates for Enlisted (Upper)” from FY 2007.
7) For SDF Youth Cadets employed as Recruits in the GSDF, MSDF and ASDF, FY 2007 was the final year
for employment of MSDF and ASDF Youth Cadets and no further recruitment and employment will be
performed. Nevertheless, from FY 2009 GSDF Youth Cadets is scheduled to be revised so that their status
is not SDF Regular Personnel but the new, non-combatant students of GSDF.
8) SDF personnel must perform duties such as defense operations as specified in the Self-Defense Forces Law.
They are, therefore, designated as special national government employees under Article 2 of the National
Civil Service Law, and personnel management of SDF personnel is conducted independently of that of
general civilian government employees.

17) For example, some firing and launch training involving tanks, anti-tank helicopters, missiles, long-range

artillery, surface-to-air guided missiles (improved Hawk and Patriot System), surface-to-surface missiles,
torpedoes, and other weapons cannot be carried out at some firing ranges in Japan, or are prohibited in
Japan as ranges exceed domestic limits. There are also various restrictions on exercises by large-scale
units that require larger areas, minesweeping training, and submarine rescue drills that are carried out in
relatively shallow sea areas, and early-morning and night-time flight training.

22) In the panel, in addition to an Executive Secretary Committee headed by the Vice-Minister of Defense, the

following five panel groups were created: 1) Panel Administration; 2) Personnel Planning Related Policy,
etc.; 3) Appointment System and Rank-based-pay, etc.; 4) Recruitment and Aid, etc.; 5) Post-Retirement
Policy, etc.
23) The Memorial Stone of SDF Members who Died on Duty was established in 1962, and reinforced in 1980,

due to aging through weathering. Afterwards, when the headquarters of the then Defense Agency was moved
to Ichigaya in 1998, the Memorial Zone in its current form was located on the east side of the memorial
area with the Memorial Stone of SDF Members who Died on Duty and Other Monuments. A Memorial
Ceremony for SDF Members who Died on Duty is held annually at the Memorial Zone. This ceremony is
attended by surviving family members of the honored dead, and also attended by high-ranking staff of the
Ministry of Defense and SDF under the Prime Minister and Minister of Defense, former Directors-General
of the Defense Agency, and others. At the Memorial Stone of SDF Members who Died on Duty in the
Memorial Zone there is an iron plate containing the names and other information of personnel killed in
the line of duty. When foreign dignitaries such as Defense Ministers visit the Ministry of Defense, they
make offerings of flowers, expressing their respect and condolences to personnel killed in the line of duty.
Memorial ceremonies are also held at individual SDF posts and bases.
24) Specific measures include: provision of education and training to acquire useful knowledge and skills for

outplacement; promotion of employment of retiring SDF Regular Personnel in the public sector; networking
of employment information at each SDF; and improvement of job-seekers’ skills by enhancing the job
training curricula.
25) “Seclusion from private companies” is stipulated in Article 62 of the Self-Defense Forces Law.
26) Superiority in prompt and accurate recognition, gathering, processing and dissemination of information.

system of each SDF service), see: <http://www.mod.go.jp/j/library/archives/it/youkou/>
28) The five policy targets are “Enhancement in Gathering/Communicating Information in the Chain of

Command (Vertical Direction)”; “Promotion of Intelligence Sharing Among Units (Horizontal Direction)”;
“Establishment of System to Cope with Cyber Attacks”; “Promotion of Intelligence Sharing with External
Organizations”; and “Enhancement of Various Telecommunication Infrastructures.”
29) See <http://www.mod.go.jp/trdi/>
30) 1) “Operational Demonstration Research” is introduced. In this type of research, the SDF service (the future

operator) will evaluate the prototypes of the equipment. The evaluation will be reflected onto the later
R&D, procurement, and related operations. 2) “Evolutionary Development” is introduced. At the start of
the development phase, the performance requirements to be achieved are left undecided. Even after the start
of the development phase, the precision of required performance can be upgraded, and up-to-date military
science technology can be newly introduced.
31) This council was established in September 2003 by the former Defense Agency; the Ministry of Education,

Culture, Sports, Science and Technology; the Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry; and the Ministry of
Land, Infrastructure and Transport. It was established to promote development of civil aircraft and engines
based on initiative taken by our nation as a whole. This is important in the sophistication of our country’s
industrial infrastructure, as well as the development and dissemination of industrial technology.
32) The generic term for the facilities used by the Self-Defense Force and the U.S. forces in Japan based on

the Japan-U.S. Security Treaty. It refers to training areas, airfields, ports, communication stations, barracks,
warehouses, ammunition depots, oil bunkers and so on.
33) The land area of defense facilities, as of 1 January this year is approximately 1,397km[2] (the sum of the

land area of SDF facilities (approximately 1,084km[2]), the land area of the facilities and areas (for exclusive
use) of the U.S. forces in Japan (approximately 309km[2]) and the land area of facilities other than SDF facilities
which the U.S. forces in Japan are jointly using under the Status of Forces Agreement (approximately
4km[2])), which accounts for approximately 0.37% of the country’s land. Of this, approximately 42% of the
land area of SDF facilities is situated in Hokkaido. Divided by use, approximately 75% of this is maneuver
areas. Meanwhile, 38km[2] of the land area of the facilities and areas of the U.S. forces in Japan (for exclusive
use) which is jointly used by the SDF under the Status of Forces Agreement.
34) 1) The filing of lawsuits which include requests from the local residents of five airports including Komatsu

Airport (Ishikawa prefecture) for the ban of night-time takeoff and landing, the compensation for noise
damage, and the acknowledgement of “the compensation for past damage” in the definitive judgments, 2)
due to the sense of inequality on the part of residents affected by the noise who have not filed claims, there
is a trend in demanding financial compensation corresponding to the past damage compensation (the claim
for which was recognized in the noise judgment) and the institutionalization of this kind of compensation
(trends demanding so-called fairness compensation), 3) demands for the expansion of all kinds of policies
by local government and residents of the areas around defense facilities.

Agency environmental consideration policy” established in 2003 based on the government’s “Basic
Environment Plan” and a review of the corresponding plans carried out in January 2005. See <http://www.
mod.go.jp/j/info/hairyo/index.html> for the environmental consideration plans of the Ministry of Defense.
37) Specifically, improvement of policies for air and water quality conservation, recycling and waste disposal,

38) From the viewpoint of security, etc., there is some information which is not suitable for release to the

public (such as 1) information that may hinder the operation of units, 2) information that may impair the
relationship of mutual trust with the nation concerned and 3) information related to individuals). However,
the Ministry of Defense will continue to retain its policy to make efforts to release information as much as
possible in order to enhance the public’s understanding.
39) In the “Opinion Poll on the Self-Defense Forces and Defense Issues” conducted in February 2006,

approximately 67% of respondents indicated their interest in the SDF and defense issues. Regarding their
impression of the SDF, roughly 85% responded “good.”* See Reference 78 for further details. In the
“Special Opinion Poll on the Self-Defense Force’s Iraq Humanitarian Reconstruction Assistance Activities”
conducted in September of the same year, approximately 72% of respondents who gained information
regarding the activities via the media (approximately 91%) regarded them as “valuable.”

## Part IV

###### Reform of the Ministry of Defense

**Section 1. Council for Reforming the Ministry of Defense**
**Section 2. Fundamental Efforts to Ensure Thorough Civilian Control**
**Section 3. Efforts to Prevent the Leakage of Information**
**Section 4. Efforts for Effective, Efficient, Open, and Transparent Procurement**
**Section 5. Other Measures**


-----

Defense capabilities are the last resort to ensure the nation’s security and cannot be substituted by other means.
Nevertheless, a defense force that lacks the public support cannot function effectively. Thus, SDF personnel
strive on a daily basis to live up to the public trust and expectations.

However, recently, the following issues have become apparent: problems related to the thoroughness of

civilian control regarding mistakes in reporting the amount of refueling and accidental disposal of logbooks,
problems related to the establishment of a rigorous information security system in light of the information
leakage via the Internet and the Special Defense Secret leakage on the Aegis system, and problems related to the
transparency of defense procurement such as excessive demand. In addition, the former Vice-Minister of Defense
was arrested on bribery charges in November 2007 and on February 19, 2008, a collision occurred between the
destroyer Atago and the fishing vessel Seitoku Maru. (See Part III, Chapter 4, Section 1)

In response to these various issues and in order to restore the public confidence in the Ministry of Defense and

the Self-Defense Forces, and ensure that they function according to their mandate, it is necessary to implement
a thorough examination of the working practices and customs that have been implemented to date and construct
fundamental measures to improve the situation.

The Ministry of Defense and the Self-Defense Forces are committed to advancing fundamental reforms that

will revitalize the organizations that are responsible for ensuring the peace and independence of the nation.

From the abovementioned perspectives, this chapter explains the reform measures being taken by the Ministry

of Defense in the following sections:

Section 1 covers the Council for Reforming the Ministry of Defense; Section 2 covers fundamental efforts to

ensure thorough civilian control; Section 3 covers efforts to prevent the leakage of information; Section 4 covers
efforts for effective, efficient, open, and transparent procurement; and Section 5 covers other measures.

The 2nd meeting of the Council for Reforming the Ministry of Defense with the
presence of Prime Minister Fukuda [Cabinet Public Relations Office]

Section 1. Council for Reforming the Ministry of Defense

It was announced in the autumn of 2007 that “Through the deliberation for the Replenishment Support Special
Measures Law, various points had been raised concerning the execution of the work by the Ministry of Defense,
which is responsible for the defense and security of Japan. Given this situation, the “Council for Reforming the
Ministry of Defense” will be held to engage in a fundamental review of the issues related to the Ministry from
the viewpoint of the public, with gaining the participation of various experts.”[1] This “Council for Reforming the
Ministry of Defense” (hereafter referred to as the “Reform Council”) was established at the Prime Minister’s
Office, and has held 11 meetings from December 2007 to July 2008, and has engaged in various discussions.
(See Fig. IV-1-1)

**1. Considerations within the Ministry of Defense**
In conjunction with the Reform Council, a panel has also been established within the Ministry of Defense to
engage in working-level discussions, and these two bodies accumulated discussions in close cooperation with
each other.

Based on the various efforts[2] in the Reform Council on the agenda items “Fundamental Measures to Ensure

Civilian Control,” “Establishment of a Stringent System for Protection of Information,” and “Transparency in
Defense Procurement,” and on discussions on other subjects, a “Ministry of Defense Reform Promotion Team”
was launched within the Defense Ministry in February 2008 for the purpose of considering the ideal form that the
structure and organization of the Ministry should take. Subsequently, at the ninth meeting in May, the Ministry
of Defense explained the series of recent incidents as well as the status of considerations concerning the ideal
structure and organization in the future.

At the ninth meeting of the Council, former Minister of Defense Ishiba presented the “Keywords for the

Reform of the Ministry of Defense” as follows: 1) “Safety from the SDF (military)” as well as “Safety through
the SDF (military),” 2) From partial optimization to total optimization, 3) Minimization of the distance and time
between the units on the scene and the central organization, 4) Optimization of human resource distribution and
personnel improvement of units on the scene and in the field of education/training as a result of this optimization,
and 5) Elimination of responsibility shifting between civilian personnel and uniformed SDF personnel, and the
development of human resources.

(See Column: Keywords for the Reform of the Ministry of Defense)

**[COLUMN]**


**COMMENTARY**

**Keywords for the Reform of the Ministry of Defense**

Keywords for the Reform of the Ministry of Defense (abstract) presented by former Minister of Defense
Ishiba in May 2008 are as follows:

**1. “Safety through the SDF (military)” as well as “Safety from the SDF (military)”**
In the past, “civilian control” was a core concept as “passive civilian control” by preventing threats to
the democratic system from armed organizations. However, nowadays, there is an additional need for
“aggressive civilian control” on “how to utilize the SDF to secure the safety of the country and citizens, and
how to realize national interests.”

Since the main body of democratic civilian control is politicians, who have responsibility to the people,

it is strongly sought to establish the best support structure.

**2. From partial to total optimization**
At present, the Ministry of Defense and the SDF consist of four Staff Offices and the Internal Bureau.
However, the interests for each organization, and the individual optimization within each organization are
prioritized, resulting in a system that makes it difficult for the Ministry of Defense and the SDF to realize total
optimization. Therefore, there is recognition of the necessity to reform the organizational structure which
may hinder the total optimization through realization of the individual optimization of each organization.

Thus, it is necessary to establish a structure which enables us to serve the state and the people through

the utmost unification of the present organizations, and enhancing support for the Minister of Defense in full
consideration of the characteristics of the civilian personnel and the uniformed SDF personnel, and ensuring
total optimization of the Ministry of Defense and the SDF as a whole.

**3. Minimize the distance and time between the units on the scene and the central organization**
Under the present organization, due to many connection points and long distance from the units on the scene
to the central organization, the following problems can be seen: time delays, inaccurate information (facts)
concerning the condition of the units and the situation resulting from alternations made at each connection
point and distance, and inaccurate transmission of the executives’ intentions, including that of the Minister.

In order to dissolve such problems, it is necessary to eliminate the intervention of the intermediate

organization as much as possible and to reorganize the organizational structure into a simple one.

In addition, with the current increase in SDF field operations, it is sought for the SDF to appropriately

execute their duties strictly in line with laws and regulations, comprehend these operations and activities
at the central organization, and achieve accountability by properly and appropriately reporting them to the
Diet and the people.

Guaranteed accuracy and speed of such administrative works is vitally important and, in order to ensure

it, we must simplify the organizational structure as much as possible.

**4. Optimization of human resource distribution and personnel improvement of units on the scene and in**

**the field of education/training**

Due to a multi-layered organizational structure with many connecting points, an ineffective distribution of
human resources has taken place.


-----

The practice of drafting a budget for each fiscal year is a good example. It has a two-step process

involving the collection of requests from the units on the scene by each Staff Office and their compilation
into a hypothetical budget frame, followed by an assessment of the Internal Bureau in consideration of the
overall balance. This process causes a considerable number of sections and personnel in the Staff Offices
to engage in “budget drafting all year long.” Such situation is not considered to be ideal and effective as the
central organization.

On the other hand, a situation which has been characterized by under-enrollment and a chronic shortage

of personnel has been seen in some units.

Even if high-level SDF personnel are placed into the units on the scene, this would not directly resolve

the shortage of personnel. However, by doing it we can expect an improvement in the poorly-staffed units.

Moreover, we will be able to allocate good human resources to posts of instructors at various educational

institutions, and contribute to the future development of human resources.

**5. Elimination of responsibility shifting between civilian personnel and uniformed SDF personnel and the**

**development of human resources**

It is not possible for the civilian personnel in the Internal Bureau to conduct adequate defense administration
without sufficient knowledge and awareness concerning the operations of the units on the scene, and the
conditions of SDF personnel on the frontline.

Even SDF officers at the Staff Offices, a central organization, do not play a role as desired for the

central organization, such as coordination with external organization, responding to the Diet and fulfilling
the accountability to the public, while concentrating their energy on operation, training and improvement
of units.

Since they have not been exposed directly to severe criticism from the outside, they tend to have peculiar

cultures. The split structure of the “Internal Bureau that is solely in charge of external adjustment and
Diet responses” and “Staff Offices solely in charge of units on the scene” are considered to be one of the
fundamental reasons behind various misconducts and failures.

Civilian personnel learning about the difficulties of units on the scene and uniformed personnel

learning about the difficulties of external coordination and responses to the Diet are expected to deepen
mutual understanding, eliminate the responsibility shifting between them, and enable them to be defense
professionals with a balance of characteristics and knowledge. From such perspective of human resources
development, the organizational structure unifying civilian and uniformed personnel for executing works is
extremely critical.

**2. Report of the Council for Reforming the Ministry of Defense**
As a result of the abovementioned discussion process, the Reform Council compiled and published a report.

The following is an explanation of the overview of the report.

**1. Introduction**
Last year the Reform Council was established at the Prime Minister’s Office in response to the frequent incidents
of misconduct at the Ministry of Defense and within the Self-Defense Forces.

Since then the individual incidents and organizational problems that caused them to occur have been

identified, and consideration has been given to demonstrate measures to prevent recurrence and a direction for
reform. It is necessary to reconstruct the organization and decision-making systems of the Ministry of Defense
and Self-Defense Forces to ensure that the principles of reform can function and that the organizations can
engage effectively and efficiently in their activities, in line with their duties.

The Self-Defense Forces are entering an era in which they must act in a multi-functional, flexible and effective

manner. In addition to further enhancing “safety from the military organization” as emphasized during the postwar period, it is also necessary to incorporate the perspective of “safety through the military organization.”

It is proposed to construct the system which will ensure effective functions of the principles of reform while

ensuring civilian control.

**2. Incidents of Misconduct - Identifying the Issues**
In recent years incidents of misconduct have repeatedly occurred at the Ministry of Defense (formerly the Defense
Agency) and in the Self-Defense Forces. Incidents that have had a considerable impact on society include the
following: mistakes in reporting the amount of refueling[3], leakage of information via the Internet[4], leakage of
Special Defense Secrets related to the Aegis system[5], the collision between the destroyer Atago and the fishing
vessel Seitoku Maru[6], and the misconduct of a former Vice-Minister. (See Fig. IV-1-2)

In order to prevent future incidents of misconduct, it is essential that continuous organization-wide efforts be

made to identify goals and nurture a sense of duty, while making every effort to minimize mistakes.

**3. Reform Proposal (1): Reform of the Consciousness of Personnel and Organizational Culture**

**(1) Principles of Reform**
The Reform Council, based on consideration and analysis of the incidents of misconduct proposes the following
principles for reform: (1) Thorough adherence to rules and regulations, (2) Establishment of professionalism
(professional awareness), and (3) Establishment of a management of works that prioritizes execution of duties,
with the aim of total optimization.

**(2) Thorough Adherence to Rules and Regulations**
It is necessary to ensure that awareness of adherence to the rules and regulations prevails in an organizational
climate. In addition, it is necessary to organize these rules in a manner that clarifies what needs to be observed.

**(3) Establishment of Professionalism (Professional Awareness)**
Senior personnel with thorough professionalism should take leadership to instill a high degree of ethics and a
sense of mission throughout the entire organization.

**Fig. IV-1-2 Major Incidents included in the Report**

|Incidents|Outline of Incidents Highlighted in the Report|
|---|---|
|Mistakes in reporting the amount of refueling (Negligence of duty to report)|Concerning the amount of fuel provided to U.S. naval vessels, incorrect figures were reported by the Head of Defense Plans and Program Division of the MSDF Maritime Staff Office, and were subsequently reflected at the press conference held by then Chief of Joint Staff, and in statements made by then Director-General of Defense Agency and Chief Cabinet Secretary. His negligence to correct the mistake even after its recognition indicates a lack of professionalism and a denial of civilian control. The responsibility to correct mistakes is ambiguous and this organizational problem must be corrected.|
|Information leakage via the Internet (Information and communication modernization and information security)|Several incidents concerning information leakage occurred in sequence until 2006, including one such incident where administrative data containing classified information was leaked through file-sharing software on a personal computer. These incidents occurred due to the failure of the SDF to stay abreast of the rapid modernization of information and communication technology, and due to the inadequacy of the security awareness of classified information.|
|Leakage of special defense secret related to the Aegis System (Education on advanced technology and information security)|Information on Aegis categorized as special defense secret was used as teaching materials and was distributed within an MSDF unit without appropriate procedures. This incident occurred due to both a desire to learn about the latest technology and a lack of awareness of information security.|
|The collision of the destroyer Atago and the fishing boat Seitoku Maru (Negligence of basic action)|The MSDF destroyer Atago collided with a fisherman’s boat. This incident demonstrates how the loosening of basic discipline, the prevalence of disregard of organizational rules, and the lack of navigation capability, can lead to disastrous results. Problems with communications information between the Staff Office and the Internal Bureau in emergency also became apparent with this incident.|
|Breach of faith by the former Vice-Minister of Defense|This was an incident in which the former Vice-Minister of Defense received monetary gifts, and used influence on the procurement of defense equipments and materials. In the procurement of equipments and materials, actions motivated by personal gains are unacceptable and are far from the professionalism of which the Internal Bureau is proud. This is a breach of faith. Furthermore, there were organizational problems to allow a grave deviation by a high-ranking ministry official.|



**(4) Establishment of a Management of Works that Prioritizes Execution of Duties, with the**

**Aim of Total Optimization**

In addition to reform of the consciousness of individual personnel and units, it is necessary to create an
organizational culture that aims at total optimization of the organization, focusing on the execution of duties.
(See Fig. IV-1-3)

**4. Reform Proposal (2): Organizational Reforms for Modern Civilian Control**

**(1) Necessity of Organizational Reform**
In order that the Ministry of Defense and Self-Defense Forces can implement the above-mentioned three
principles of reform steadily and effectively, organizational reform is required.

**(2) Strategic Level: Strengthening Command Functions of the Prime Minister’s Office**
The Reform Council proposes that the Prime Minister’s Office should utilize the Security Council and other
ministerial councils to strengthen the command functions by actively and comprehensively discussing the critical
items for security. The specific measures are shown in Figure IV-1-4.

However, the Internal Bureau will assist the Minister of Defense in terms of system and policies|


**5. Conclusion**
The Ministry of Defense should promptly compile an implementation plan for the reforms contained in these
proposals and move to implement such reforms. In addition, when implementing organizational reform, multifaceted simulations should be implemented in advance.

The Reform Council proposed issues to be considered in the future, such as how the Ministry of Defense

and Self-Defense Forces, police forces, and the Japan Coast Guard should cooperate more closely to fulfill the
function of the government as a whole.

The Council expects that the Ministry of Defense and the Self-Defense Forces will be revitalized as

professional organizations that have their pride.

**3. Future Efforts**
Given the series of incidents of misconduct since last year at the Ministry of Defense and the Self-Defense Forces
that resulted in a significant loss of public confidence, the reform council was established at the Prime Minister’s
Office and the contents of the report issued by the Council have been taken with the utmost seriousness by the
Ministry of Defense.

This report sets out a fundamental direction for the rebirth of the Ministry of Defense and the Self-Defense

Forces, and in order to follow the basic direction laid out in the report and to realize reform of the Ministry, the
Ministry of Defense Reform Head Office headed by the Defense Minister was established in July. Furthermore,
in order to thoroughly disseminate the reform to all personnel, and to secure engagement by the Ministry of
Defense and the SDF as a whole, the Ministry of Defense Nationwide Staff Meeting was held with the attendance
of senior personnel of the Ministry of Defense and Self-Defense Forces.

Section 2. Fundamental Efforts to Ensure Thorough Civilian Control

In a democratic nation, politics must be given priority over the military. However, recently, public confidence in
the processes of administrative works at the Ministry of Defense and the Self-Defense Forces has been lost, and
very serious issues concerning civilian control have emerged.

Given this situation, this section explains the specific content of the incidents that have occurred and sets out

the points at issue and specific efforts based on them. (See Part II, Chapter 1, Section 3)

**1. Recent Incidents**

**1. Incident of Mistakes in Reporting the Amount of Refueling[7]**

In 2003, the MSDF replenishment ship Tokiwa refueled U.S. vessels based on the former Anti-Terrorism Special
Measures Law. Although a division head of the Maritime Staff Office noticed inaccurate information on the
amount of refueling, he failed to report this mistake to senior personnel nor to the Internal Bureau. Subsequently,
based on the inaccurate information, then Chief Cabinet Secretary Yasuo Fukuda and then Director-General of
the Defense Agency Shigeru Ishiba made responses in press conferences and at the Diet.

This incident resulted in a loss of confidence in the work-process at the Ministry of Defense and the Self
Defense Forces. This is a very significant problem in terms of thorough civilian control that should be seriously
taken, as detailed below:
1) Work-processing mistakes within the Ministry of Defense, including a report with inaccurate figures and

the failure to correct the report, demonstrated that the Ministry of Defense failed to appropriately assist the
Minister of Defense, who is a core of civilian control.
2) Responses based on the inaccurate figures were made at the Diet, which demonstrates that the Ministry of

Defense and Self-Defense Forces will not be appropriately controlled by the Diet, which is responsible for
final civilian control.
3) At the same time, the fact that inaccurate information was given directly to the people through press conferences

is a grave situation that may cause damage to the basis of the issue of civilian control.

**2. Mistaken Destruction of Ship Deck Log[8]**

The ship deck log is a document that is prepared on MSDF vessels to record the activities and movements of that
vessel. Regulations require that the log be kept on board for one year after the day the log is recorded, and, after
that, should be stored for three years at the Regional Staff Office. However, on the replenishment ship Towada,
which had been dispatched to the Indian Ocean under the former Anti-Terrorism Special Measures Law, a part
of the ship deck log was mistakenly destroyed after the ship returned to Japan within the period of preservation
of the document.

This work processing raises the following significant problems:
1) The supervision and instructions by a supervisor on document management on a daily basis were

insufficient.
2) The appropriate procedures for document management were not taken.
3) The preservation of the ship deck log was not appropriately implemented according to regulations.

**3. Collision between the Destroyer Atago and the Fishing Vessel Seitoku Maru**
It was a serious problem in terms of the crisis management that considerable time was taken to report to the Prime
Minister and Minister of Defense, who are responsible for civilian control, after the occurrence of the collision
between the destroyer Atago and the fishing vessel Seitoku Maru at 04:07 on February 19, 2008. The fact also


-----

shows that appropriate assistance has not been conducted to the Prime Minister and Minister of Defense.

**2. Efforts at the Ministry of Defense**
Given the occurrence of the incident of mistakes in reporting the amount of refueling, and the mistaken
destruction of a ship deck log, from the perspective of ensuring thorough civilian control, in October 2007, the
Ministry of Defense established the Committee on Drastic Measures to Ensure Civilian Control and has engaged
in discussions on what drastic steps should be taken, including thorough prevention of recurrence.

In the incident of the collision between the destroyer Atago and the fishing vessel Seitoku Maru, an instruction

concerning reports on incidents and accidents was revised on the day of the incident, and in March 2008, the
existing system was completely revised and a new instruction concerning rapid reports related to emergency
situations was issued. (See Part III, Chapter 4, Section 1)

Based on the above, in April 2008, in order to prevent recurrence of an incident like the series of incidents

of misconduct and accidents, the Committee on Drastic Measures to Ensure Civilian Control was abolished
and the Council on Drastic Measures to Prevent Recurrence of and Responses to Incidents and Accidents was
established, considering that in addition to stop-gap measures, the background and fundamental causes of the
incident should also be considered candidly to make any improvements, and that based on the harsh criticism
of Ministry of Defense explanations following such incidents, it is necessary to fundamentally discuss how the
accountability of the Ministry should be improved as required.

In addition, in the report by the Reform Council released in July 2008, a direction was laid out for the reform

at the Prime Minister’s Office and at the Ministry of Defense that will serve as “organizational reforms to ensure
modern civilian control.” Of them, measures for organizational reforms to strengthen command and control
functions at the Ministry of Defense are as follows: (1) strengthening of policy-making structures that are centered
on the Defense Minister; (2) strengthening of the functions of the Bureau of Defense Policy; (3) strengthening
of the functions of the Joint Staff Office; (4) unification of sections responsible for defense capabilities build-up;
and (5) measures in other important areas.

The Ministry of Defense will make every effort to advance these measures to realize the reform in the

future.

Section 3. Efforts to Prevent the Leakage of Information

Leakage of some information handled by the Ministry of Defense could have serious impact on the defense of
Japan. Protection of such classified information is the essential foundation to fulfill defense of our country and
maintain security of our country. Accordingly, the Ministry of Defense defines three types of classified information
and stipulates procedures for designation and handling, such as communication, storage and disposal for each
information, in order to prevent unauthorized personnel from inappropriately accessing the information in an
effort to protect it. The three types of classified information are: “Special Defense Secret,” which is information
concerning materials, equipment, etc. provided by the United States based on the Mutual Defense Assistance
Agreement between Japan and the United States of America; “Defense Secret,” which is designated by the
Minister of Defense as information concerning SDF operations, build-up of defense capabilities, etc. that must be
kept secret for national defense; and the so-called “Ministry of Defense Secret,” which is classified information,
other than those listed above, related to administrative work of the Ministry of Defense.

The following incidents where classified information was leaked have taken place at the Ministry of Defense

and the Self-Defense Forces, as explained below.

This section explains the points of issue arising from these incidents and measures taken based on them.

**1. Recent Incidents**

**1. Incident of Information Leakage via the Internet**
A series of information leakage via the Internet occurred at the Ministry of Defense and the Self-Defense Forces.
In February 2006, an incident of leakage of classified information on the destroyer Asayuki from a privatelyowned personal computer through file-sharing software came to light.

The fact that the Ministry of Defense’s information security systems and awareness of personnel have not

kept abreast of recent rapid IT innovation is in the background of this incident.

**2. Incident of Leakage of Special Defense Secret Concerning the Aegis System**
In January 2007 it was discovered that a crew member of the destroyer Shirane had saved information that was
thought to be classified on an external hard disk at the crew member’s home, and as a result of investigations, in
December 2007, an MSDF officer was arrested on suspicion of leaking Special Defense Secrets concerning the
Aegis system, and four other MSDF officers were sent to the prosecutor.

The following problems are considered to have contributed to this incident: (1) lack of awareness concerning

information security, including violation of rules and the fact that they easily copied the classified documents; (2)
an incomplete system for protecting classified information, including the implementation of education involving
classified information without approval; (3) incomplete management of personal computers (this incident
emerged prior to the implementation of drastic measures to prevent a recurrence of a leakage of information
via the Internet, as described above); and (4) insufficient monitoring and surveillance by managers and persons
responsible for the protection of classified information.

As a result of investigations into this incident, although it was not confirmed that Special Defense Secrets had

been leaked outside the SDF, there is a possibility that external leakage could have occurred in consideration of
the fact that confidential information about the Aegis system was leaked to numerous SDF personnel. This was
a very serious problem involving information security. This incident could have resulted in significant distrust
among the public concerning the information security of the MSDF and indeed the SDF as a whole, and has also
impacted the Japan-U.S. Security Arrangements and relations with other countries. Furthermore, it has had a
severe impact on the morale of SDF personnel.


-----

The Ministry of Defense has examined and investigated the facts of this incident and in March 2008, the

result was reported to the public[9].

**2. Efforts at the Ministry of Defense**
In February 2006, in response to the incident of information leakage via the Internet, the Ministry of Defense
took a number of emergency measures, including removal of file-sharing software installed on privately-owned
personal computers which had been used for work; removal of classified information and unnecessary data
relating to work; and total prohibition of the use of privately-owned personal computers to handle classified
information.

In addition to these emergency measures, in February 2006, the Commission on Drastic Measures to Prevent

Recurrence of Computer Related Classified Information Leakages, headed by the then Parliamentary Secretary
for Defense, was established. The Commission discussed specific drastic measures to prevent recurrence and
released them in April 2006. After that, in April 2006, the Committee to Implement Measures for the Prevention
of the Recurrence of Computer Related Classified Information Leakages, headed by the then Parliamentary
Secretary for Defense was established, and it has endeavored to take specific measures.

Under the circumstances, the incident of the leakage of Special Defense Secrets concerning the Aegis system

came to light. In response to it, the Committee to Implement Measures for the Prevention of the Recurrence of
Computer Related Classified Information Leakages was abolished, and the Council for Prevention of Information
Leakage, headed by the Minister of Defense, was newly established in April 2007. This Council is engaged
in consideration and implementation of measures, based on an awareness that the importance of information
management and drastic measures to prevent leakages have not sufficiently permeated through the terminal
members of the Defense Ministry and the SDF.

The major measures implemented to date by the Ministry of Defense and the SDF concerning prevention of

information leakage are shown in Fig. IV-3-1.

The Ministry of Defense and the SDF would like to continue such efforts based on the report by the Council

for Reforming the Ministry of Defense in July 2008.

Section 4. Efforts for Effective, Efficient, Open, and Transparent Procurement

Appropriate and efficient procurement of defense equipment and materials is one of the most important elements
for Japan’s defense. It is also imperative to maintain indispensable production and technological infrastructure
for defense equipment in Japan even in peacetime. Moreover, since last year, taking into account several incidents
of excessive billing by import firms that came to light, there is a need to build a transparent and fair system that is
better able to fulfill its accountability to the public, including with regard to the importation of equipment.

This section will explain in detail the various efforts that the Ministry of Defense has taken thus far, as well

as new initiatives that will be taken in light of the incidents of excessive billing for procurement of imports.

**1. The Ministry of Defense’s Efforts to Date**

**1. Comprehensive Acquisition Reform**
The Ministry of Defense has been promoting comprehensive acquisition reform. The major goals are: more
efficient and streamlined procurement, supply and lifecycle cost management of defense equipment and
materials; enhancement of open and transparent procurement processes; as well as preservation and upgrading of
the necessary defense production and technological infrastructure.

Once procured, major defense equipment is used over a long period of time, ranging from 10 to 20 years and

beyond. Therefore, acquisition reform towards more efficient and streamlined management of equipment—from
concept-refining, development, procurement, operation (including maintenance and repairs) to disposal—is of
increasing importance. In light of this fact, the Ministry of Defense established the Equipment Procurement
Office (then) in July 2006 with the aim of achieving more efficient equipment procurement[10].

The Ministry of Defense is pursuing a variety of efforts for efficient procurement of equipment and materials.

These include the bulk purchase of equipment in a single fiscal year rather than over multiple fiscal years;
lump-sum purchase of equipment and materials instead of respective purchase by the three SDF services;
commoditization of certain specifications at the development stage; introduction of commercial off-the-shelf
products; private consignment; and review of equipment maintenance costs.

While the Japanese government is making efforts to assure appropriate public purchasing in all fields, the

Ministry of Defense has also been reviewing private contract procedures to enhance the transparency and fairness
of the procurement process. Private contract procedures are being reformed by expanding the scope of the
comprehensive evaluation bidding system[11], increasing the number of contracts for bulk purchase of equipment
over multiple fiscal years, and introducing efficient bidding procedures. A vice-chief in charge of auditing was
appointed at the Equipment Procurement Office in July 2006, while a councilor in charge of auditing and Audit
Division were set up in the Internal Bureau in the Ministry of Defense in August 2006. (See Part IV, Sections 2
and 3)

(See Columns: “What is the procedure for equipment selection?” and “What are the concrete measures for

cost reduction?”)

**2. Enhancement and Strengthening of the Defense Production & Technological Infrastructure**
Regarding equipment, it is necessary to pursue effective and efficient acquisition of equipment that adequately
responds to the development of joint operations and meets the needs of troops, taking into account the latest
trends in military science and technology. Therefore, for the acquisition of equipment the SDF selects the most
appropriate method of procurement—domestic manufacture, import, or licensed domestic manufacture—on the
basis of deliberations that take into consideration not only performance and price, but also maintenance, supply,
ease of education and training, and the necessity of Japan’s own reforms.


-----

In doing so, securing a domestic production and technology infrastructure that possesses the production

capacity and technological capability to supply outstanding domestically-produced equipment plays an important
role. In other words, regarding key types of equipment such as aircraft, ships, tanks and guided missiles,
production volumes are low as a whole, initial investment is high and a high level of technological capability is
required. The number of companies able to develop and produce these types of equipment is therefore limited
to one or a handful of companies. For this reason, there is a possibility that withdrawal from the market of a
single firm involved in the manufacture of equipment could immediately interfere with the stable acquisition
and maintenance of equipment. When procuring equipment from outside of Japan, maintaining this domestic
production and technology infrastructure makes it possible to secure negotiating power with the partner country
and acquire equipment under conditions as favorable as possible to Japan.

For this reason, the Ministry of Defense, taking severe financial circumstances into account, believes that it

should clarify the areas of defense production and technological infrastructure that should be prioritized, fostered
and maintained, centered around the core technology areas indispensable to the safety and security of Japan,
and that it should make efforts toward the establishment of truly essential domestic production and technology
infrastructure.

(See Reference 80)

**2. Recent Incidents**

**1. Excessive Billing by Yamada Corporation**
On November 22, 2007, it was determined that Yamada Corporation had engaged in excessive billing for two
pieces of imported equipment that had been delivered to the Ministry of Defense.

In light of this discovery, the Ministry both halted business transactions with Yamada Corporation and

implemented a survey of all contracts concluded with this company from 2002 and onward to verify the
authenticity of estimates through direct contact with the overseas manufacturers. As a result of this inquiry, an
additional 16 incidents of excessive billing were revealed, and disclosed to the public on February 28.

In addition, regarding a procurement contract for chaff/flare launchers in 2000, although there were suspicions

that the company had engaged in excessive billing by falsifying the estimate provided by U.S. manufacturer
BAE Systems, Inc., it was ultimately decided that only an initial reduction of the contract had been made. An
investigation into the contract through documents from the time, interviews with employees and information
provided by BAE is ongoing, along with an investigation of excessive billing by Yamada Corporation. Currently
the Ministry is conducting a random survey of other import firms to confirm the authenticity of estimates directly
with overseas manufacturers.

Through this random survey, it has been discovered that estimates had been falsified in six contracts for

submarine communications antennas procured by Kyokuto Boeki Kaisha, Ltd. (KBK), and that excessive billing
had occurred in five of these contracts. This finding was announced on January 7, 2008.

In light of this discovery, the Ministry of Defense both halted business transactions with KBK and implemented

a survey of all contracts conducted with this company from 2002 and onward to verify the authenticity of estimates
through direct contact with the overseas manufacturers. As a result of this inquiry, an additional 12 incidents of
excessive billing were revealed and disclosed to the public on June 20.

**2. Selection and Procurement of C-X Engines and Other Equipment**
There were several accusations made regarding the involvement of a former Vice-Minister of Defense in the
selection and procurement of the engines for the ASDF’s next-generation cargo aircraft (C-X), the engines
installed in biological reconnaissance vehicles and minesweeper/cargo helicopters (MCH-101), and the engines
installed in 19DD destroyers. As a result, there have been calls for even further transparency in the decisionmaking processes of the Ministry of Defense.


-----

**3. New Initiatives at the Ministry of Defense**

**1. Recent Actions**
Recently, there have been changes in the situation surrounding acquisition of equipment. First, amid budget
constraints, rising unit prices of equipment due to the increasing sophistication of equipment has led to a decrease
in the volume of units procured. This in turn gives rise to a vicious cycle in which unit prices consequently
increase still further. Therefore, promotion of various cost control measures are an urgent issue.

Second, there has long been an increasing demand for greater transparency and openness in the process.

Although in the past the Ministry of Defense has endeavored to disclose information related to the acquisition of
equipment – even amid such restraints as the limited number of firms capable of manufacturing defense equipment
and the need for preservation of confidentiality – there
has been demand for increased accountability, including
with regard to procurement procedures.

In light of such changes to the situation, in October

2007, the Ministry received the Ministerial Directive
for the Acceleration of Acquisition Transformation,
and the Project Team for the Promotion of Acquisition
Transformation was established, led by Parliamentary
Secretary for Defense Terada. Immediately following
its establishment, this team uncovered incidents of
excessive billing for import procurement, and has since
held a total of 10 meetings on of the issue of import
procurement. In March 2008, it released a report on the Project Team for the Promotion of Comprehensive Acquisition Reform headed by

former Parliamentary Secretary for Defense Terada

topic[12].

**2. Efforts for Comprehensive Acquisition Reform**

**(1) Actions for Import Issues**
In November 2007, several incidents related to import procurement came to light, including the determination
that excessive billing had taken place in two contracts for equipment delivered to the Ministry of Defense by
Yamada Corporation.

The Ministry of Defense is making the following efforts to address this issue:
1) In order to uncover and prevent excessive billing, the Ministry is consulting directly with overseas manufacturers

to obtain estimates.
2) The number of import liaisons in the Equipment Procurement and Construction Office has been increased

from 3 to 10 people to enhance the price survey function in the United States. (FY 2008)
3) In order to facilitate the participation of overseas manufacturers in the contract, the Ministry is continuously

improving the environment and promoting direct contracts (including through the use of bid guidance materials
written in English and by conducting English-language information sessions).
4) The Ministry will request a FY 2009 budget for the department of import in the Equipment Procurement and

Construction Office.
5) The Ministry will make use of chartered accountants and personnel from outside who have worked in trading

companies.
6) The Ministry will strengthen punitive measures against incidents of excessive billing (the Ministry currently

demands the refund of the amount paid in excess and charges a penalty equal to the amount paid in excess.
This penalty will be doubled). (FY 2008)


-----

7) In addition to comparing the records in the trading company’s accounting system with the estimate submitted

to the Ministry of Defense, the Ministry will introduce an import procurement survey that investigates the
company’s internal fraud prevention measures and legal compliance structures. (FY 2008)

**(2) Enhancing Management of Equipment Lifecycle Costs**
Generally, the equipment is designed, developed, and manufactured over a significant period of time and at
considerable cost, and the equipment is used for a long period of time. The Ministry has estimated the lifecycle
costs (LCC) for certain individual pieces of equipment over the entire lifecycle of the equipment, from conceptrefining to development, procurement, operation (including maintenance and repairs) and disposal.

In order to promote LCC management on a Ministry-wide basis, in March 2008, the Ministry set up LCC

management procedures and calculation procedures and applied LCC management to key equipment on a trial
basis. Going forward, the Ministry will also pursue new initiatives, including establishment of cross-organizational
liaison and coordination meetings based on the IPT[13] methods in use in various other countries, and establishment
of uniform calculation methods for LCC.

**(3) Establishment of Performance Targets for Cost Control**
For the first time, the Ministry of Defense has established a comprehensive cost reduction goal of a 15% reduction
in costs within five years (by FY 2011) and a 9% reduction in costs by FY 2009 in comparison with the costs in
FY 2006 through efficiency-boosting measures such as ongoing review of methods of acquisition, utilization of
commercial products and technologies and integrated procurement.

**(4) Expansion of Incentive Contracts[14]**

The Ministry of Defense has made use of only two incentive contracts since the concept was introduced in 1999.
The Ministry has introduced a new system that improves the evaluation procedure for corporate proposals which
promotes corporate cost reduction activities by reviewing the overall system to enhance the effect of incentive
contracts.

**(5) Expansion of Outsourcing to the Private Sector**
In order to respond to the increasing sophistication of equipment and diversity of missions, there are limits to
the conventional model of task-by-task basis outsourcing to the private sector. Therefore, from the perspective
of acquisition transformation, the Ministry of Defense continues to implement analysis of cost effectiveness,
including ascertaining total costs, and promote the utilization of new methods (such as PFIs[15]) to further expand
outsourcing to the private sector.

**(6) Further Improvement of Foreign Military**

**Sales (FMS)**

FMS is the supply of equipment to eligible armsexporting countries based on United States Government
laws on arms export control. Currently, however, there
are several issues, including insufficient disclosure
of cost breakdowns. Going forward, the Ministry of
Defense will make efforts for further improvement,
including expansion of cost breakdowns.


-----

**(7) Acquisition of Equipment from the Perspective of Joint Operations**
In the past as well, 1) unification of equipment specifications, 2) standardization of equipment, 3) integration of
the command and operations systems of the SDF services, and 4) research and development concerning 1) to
3) above have been conducted on the premise of joint operations. Going forward, while continuing to promote
consideration of suitable equipment to contribute to joint operations in the fields of rescue, health, transportation,
and warning and surveillance, the Ministry of Defense will conduct efforts toward such goals as materializing
a framework of deliberation and coordination, and establishing the system for sharing information on stock and
specifications among the SDF services.

**(8) Strengthening Evaluation of Technological Research and Development, etc.**
From the perspective of acquisition improvement, current evaluation of research and development is by no means
sufficient. Therefore, the Ministry of Defense has established a Technology Evaluation Committee headed by the
Parliamentary Minister for Defense and has instituted a new and effective structure for evaluation of technology.

In addition, with the aim of promoting international cooperation that contributes to effective and efficient

research and development, while vitalizing technological exchange with various countries, the Ministry of
Defense must further deepen its discussions on the background, benefits, and problems related to joint international
research and development.

**(9) Review of Central and Regional Procurement**
In order to conduct third-party oversight of contracts at regional departments and bureaus, the Ministry of
Defense reviews the bid oversight committees of regional defense bureaus and conducts oversight of contracts
related to equipment and materials.

In addition, in order to further improve transparency, the approval of the Minister of Defense, which currently

applies to only high-level negotiated contracts in central procurement, is conducted at the regional level as
well, taking into account operational efficiency (as with central procurement, this applies to contracts for major
equipment over 150 million yen).

**(10) Division of Duties for Various Stages of Planning and Procurement in Equipment Selection**
For next-generation rescue helicopters and other equipment, based on the outcome of detailed deliberation on
more transparent and efficient equipment selection procedures, the Ministry of Defense will implement a test-run
of the system in which the Bureau of Defense Policy is in charge of selecting functions and performance, while the
Bureau of Finance and Equipment is in charge of model types and acquisition method. (In April 2008, the Ministry
of Defense formed a cross-organizational work team to deliberate on selection procedures and other matters.)

In addition, the Ministry of Defense is aiming to review procedures for selection of aircraft model types, and

looking into application and expansion of a more competitive bidding system.

**3. Steady Implementation of Measures**
In advancing measures for reform, it is extremely important to continually propose new measures while making
clear the road for steady implementation of those measures.

Going forward, taking into account the schedule for implementation of acquisition improvement, the Ministry

of Defense will conduct a necessary review of the progress of measures at each important point. Through such
measures, the Ministry of Defense will endeavor to advance acquisition improvement without backtracking or
unproductive delays.

Moreover, based on the contents of the July report of the “Council for Reforming the Ministry of Defense,”

these efforts will be continued.

**Q&A**

**What is the procedure for equipment selection?**

The equipment selection process depends on the type of equipment. The basic flow is as follows:

1) First, the necessary functions and performance for defense of Japan are evaluated.
2) Next, factors such as cost, introduction method such as whether it is acquisition of a newly-developed

equipment item or existing one, the type of equipment, type of model, and quantity are determined.

For example, in the case of an aircraft, after the process whereby the Internal Bureau of the Ministry

of Defense performs adjustment and evaluation of the model selection plan and performance requirement[1]
made by the Ground, Maritime or Air Self-Defense Force, the proposal of model selection is drafted as the
Ministry of Defense Proposal. After the model selection of the aircraft with items that should be kept secret
is submitted to and evaluated by the Aircraft Model Selection Conference in the Ministry of Defense for
consultation and approval, a decision is made by the Minister of Defense. Furthermore, regarding model
selection of combat aircraft, the Security Council is consulted in accordance with the year end budget
compilation as an important issue for the maintenance of defense forces for each fiscal year.

For aircraft with no items requiring secrecy, such as training aircraft, a competitive bidding system that

adopts the comprehensive evaluation bidding method may be used.

1) Required performance items in order to satisfy required items such as operation objective, operation structure, and expected
main performance.

**[COLUMN]**

**Q&A**

**What are the concrete measures for cost reduction?**

The measures for cost reduction and the amount of expenditure retrenchment raised by the cost reduction
effort in recent years are as follows.
m Active use of commercial goods and technology
The Ministry of Defense makes effort in the use of commercial goods and technology, such as the use of
commercial goods for components of the ASDF’s JADGE system (expenditure retrenchment of approx.
¥600 million), pursuing the adoption of specification of the commercial vessels as much as possible
in regards to the marine observation vessels and examines the observation equipment (expenditure
retrenchment of approx. ¥16 billion).

m Lump-sum procurement
The Ministry of Defense has introduced lump-sum procurement for the equipment as follows:

1) GSDF’s Type-89 rifles (approx. 20,000 rifles: expenditure retrenchment of approx. ¥300 million), 2)
MSDF’s next-generation patrol aircraft (P-1: expenditure retrenchment of approx. ¥10.6 billion) (four
aircraft in two years), 3) MSDF’s minesweeping and transport helicopters (MCH-101: expenditure
retrenchment of approx. ¥300 million) (three aircraft in two years), 4) modernization of ASDF’s combat
aircraft (F-15) (20 aircraft in two years: expenditure retrenchment of approx. ¥16.8 billion).

m Revision of maintenance measures
The Ministry of Defense has reviewed maintenance regulations to extend the period of periodic repairs of
ASDF short-range SAM (expenditure retrenchment of approx. ¥1.1 billion).

m Revision of specifications
As a result of technology advancement, crashworthiness has been given to fiber-reinforced plastic (FRP).
Thus, the body of minesweepers (MSC) is switched from wood to fiber-reinforced plastic (FRP), which
has made it possible to expand the minesweepers’ service life to approximately 30 years. This figure is
double that of the wood-body MSC (an expenditure retrenchment of approx. ¥600 million).

Note: The amount of expenditure retrenchment is an estimation made at the time of budget compilation,

which is expected to change according to the situations of future procurements.

Section 5. Other Measures

**1. Efforts in Response to the Fire on the Destroyer Shirane**
In December 2007, a crew member of the destroyer Shirane, which was berthed in the Yokosuka area, spotted
smoke coming out of the ship’s Combat Information Center (CIC) and a fire was detected. The damage included
complete loss of the equipment in the CIC, while some of the equipment in the rooms adjacent to the CIC was
also rendered unusable. A portion of the ship body itself was also damaged due to the heat of the fire.

Regarding the cause of the fire, the possibility that it was started by an unextinguished cigarette or by arson

were determined to be extremely low. The fact that the fastest-burning area was around a cooling box that was
placed on top of a refrigerator raised questions, but the refrigerator and the cooling box were severely damaged,
and it was not possible from the remains to identify which portion had initially caught fire. Therefore, it could not
be determined whether the refrigerator and the cooling box were the cause of the fire.

Accordingly, the Ministry of Defense and the Self-Defense Forces have compiled recurrence preventive

measures including: 1) tightened restrictions on the use of home electronic appliances in combat areas; 2)
investigation for improving firefighting equipment, etc.; 3) establishment of a rapid and reliable internal and
external reporting system; and 4) strict check of the locking status of secure areas through on-vessel inspection
in order to ensure reliable locking of secured areas such as the CIC. These were announced in March 2008 along
with the results of the investigation into the fire[16].

**2. Efforts to Uphold the Self-Defense Forces Personnel Ethics Code and Act**
In August 1999, the Self-Defense Forces Personnel Ethics Act was established along with the National Public
Service Ethics Act, and came into effect the following April. The purpose of this Act is to take necessary measures
that contribute to the maintenance of ethics pertaining to the duties of Self-Defense Forces personnel in order to
ensure the trust of the public that duties are being carried out in an open manner. In addition, the establishment
of a Self-Defense Forces Personnel Ethics Code (Ethics Code) was decreed by Cabinet Order on the basis of this
Act.

In 2007, it became clear that a former Vice-Minister of Defense had violated this Ethics Code, and at the

order of the Minister of Defense, starting in October 2007 the Inspector General’s Office of Legal Compliance
conducted a special defense inspection[17] regarding the compliance of senior personnel[18] with the Ethics Code.

To date, a total of three senior personnel have been found in violation of the Ethics Code following the

implementation of the Code by inspection, involving such incidents as golf outings, wining and dining with
those who have interests in the duties of Self-Defense Forces personnel[19], and receiving gifts from those who
have interests in the duties of Self-Defense Forces personnel. In addition, on February 1, 2008 the Ministry of
Defense announced[20] the status of the inspection, indicating the need to pay sufficient attention to the following
two points:
1) Because some SDF personnel have numerous opportunities to interact with outside parties, including those

who have interests in the duties of Self-Defense Forces personnel, in addition to complying with the Ethics
Code at all times, it is important to consider the intent and purpose of institutions such as the Code to prevent
suspicion and mistrust from the public.
2) In particular, high-level officials should keep in mind the influence of their positions being that they superintend

their subordinates’ behavior in their dealings with outside parties.


-----

**3. Measures against Drug Abuse**
The Ministry of Defense and SDF deeply regret the series of drug abuse incidents which occurred in 2005, and
established the Committee on Measures for Drug Issues in October 2005. This Committee issued a final report in
February 2006 describing the problems, measures for their future prevention, and other related issues[21].

Despite these efforts, there have been additional incidents of SDF members being arrested on allegations of

violating drug-related laws. The Ministry of Defense and the SDF will continue to take strict measures to prevent
a recurrence.

10) In September 2007, the Equipment Procurement Office was reorganized as the Equipment and Facilities

Headquarters.
11) Regarding the extremely important matter of evaluation of technical factors, this differs from an automatic

bidding procedure which determines the vendor solely on the basis of price, instead of on a comprehensive
evaluation of additional factors as well as price.

13) IPT: Integrated Project Team. A cross-organizational team formed to coordinate information and opinion
sharing among related divisions and stakeholders in order to efficiently resolve a specific issue. IPTs
are used in defense equipment acquisition processes in Europe and the United States, as well as in plant
construction by private companies and information system development.
14) A system which seeks to reduce procurement costs by incentivizing private companies to reduce costs.

When a cost reduction on a project is achieved due to the efforts of the private company that has been
commissioned for the work, a portion of the cost savings is awarded to the company.
15) Use of private-sector funds, management capability, or technological capability for public facilities or

equipment.
16) See <http://www.mod.go.jp/j/sankou/report/2008/pdf/shirane_080321.pdf>
17) Refers to administrative officials at or above the level of section chief or the equivalent, and SDF personnel

of the rank of major general or above.
18) The Inspector General’s Office of Legal Compliance would conduct an inspection particularly of the items

mandated by the Minister of Defense.
19) Business persons among those who fall under the administration of SDF personnel who are concluding

contracts with the Ministry of Defense, and others.
20) See <http://www.mod.go.jp/j/sankou/report/2008/pdf/0201.pdf>
21) The “final report” recommended immediate, comprehensive implementation of the following and other

measures to prevent recurrence: a) thorough disciplinary guidance and education; b) introduction of drug
testing (urine analysis) (SDF members are tested for drugs upon enlistment).

**Reference 8. National Defense Program Guidelines, FY 2005-**

(Approved by the Security Council and the Cabinet on December 10, 2004)

**I. Purpose**
**II. Security Environment Surrounding Japan**
**III. Basic Principles of Japan’s Security Policy**
**IV. Future Defense Forces**
**V. Additional Elements for Consideration**

**I. Purpose**
In order to ensure the peace and safety of Japan and peace and stability of the international community, given the
current security environment surrounding our country, the Security Council and Cabinet of the Government of
Japan approved the “National Defense Program Guidelines, FY 2005-.” The Guidelines build on the December
19, 2003 Security Council and Cabinet decision, “On Introduction of Ballistic Missile Defense System and Other
Measures.”

**II. Security Environment Surrounding Japan**
1. The 9/11 terrorist attacks on the United States demonstrated that, in addition to such traditional problems
as inter-state military confrontations, non-state actors such as international terrorist organizations have
emerged as a dire threat in today’s security environment.

Against a backdrop of increased interdependence and growing globalization, the international community

is facing urgent new threats and diverse situations to peace and security, including the proliferation of weapons
of mass destruction and ballistic missiles, as well as international terrorist activities (hereinafter “new threats
and diverse situations”). We need to bear in mind that conventional forms of deterrence may no longer work
effectively against international terrorist organizations, which have neither states nor citizens to protect.

Ten years have passed since the end of the Cold War. Mutual cooperation and interdependence among

major countries have deepened, as exemplified by the growing trust between the United States and the Russian
Federation. Since a stable international environment serves the interests of all nations, greater efforts at
international coordination and cooperation on security issues have taken root in the international community,
including those within the framework of international organizations such as the United Nations.


-----

In this context, the United States, as the sole superpower, continues to contribute significantly to

international peace and stability by taking active measures to combat terrorism and to prevent proliferation
of weapons of mass destruction.

In the meantime, the use of military force now plays a broader role in the international community

than simply deterring or responding to armed conflict: Military force is also used for a variety of purposes,
including the prevention of conflict and the reconstruction assistance.
2. As a result of the further expansion and deepening of interdependence among the nations in recent years,

greater efforts are also being made to promote and strengthen bilateral and multilateral coordination and
cooperation in the Asia-Pacific region. However, although Russia has drastically reduced its armed forces in
the Far East since the end of the Cold War, massive military might, including nuclear arsenals, continue to
exist in the region, and a number of countries are pouring in efforts to modernize their military forces. The
situation on the Korean Peninsula is unpredictable and cross-Taiwan Strait relations remain uncertain.

North Korea is engaged in the development, deployment and proliferation of weapons of mass destruction

and ballistic missiles, and it maintains a large number of special operations forces. Such military activities
by North Korea constitute a major destabilizing factor to regional and international security, and are a
serious challenge to international non-proliferation efforts.

China, which has a major impact on regional security, continues to modernize its nuclear forces and

missile capabilities as well as its naval and air forces. China is also expanding its area of operation at sea.
We will have to remain attentive to its future actions.

The close and cooperative relationship between Japan and the United States, based on the Japan-U.S.

Security Arrangements, continues to play an important role for the security of Japan as well as for peace and
stability in the Asia-Pacific region.
3. In light of the security environment surrounding our country, as outlined above, even though a full-scale
invasion against Japan is increasingly unlikely, Japan must now deal with new threats and diverse situations
in addition to regional security issues.
4. In considering Japan’s security, we have to take into account vulnerabilities resulting from: limited
strategic depth; long coast lines and numerous small islands; a high population density; the concentration
of population and industry in urban areas; and a large number of important facilities in coastal areas, in
addition to frequent natural disasters due to Japan’s geological and climatic conditions, and the security of
sea lines of communication which are indispensable to the country’s prosperity and growth.

**III. Basic Principles of Japan’s Security Policy**
1. Basic Principles
The first objective of Japan’s security policy is to prevent any threat from reaching Japan and, in the event
that it does, repel it and minimize any damage. The second objective is to improve the international security
environment so as to reduce the chances that any threat will reach Japan in the first place. Japan will achieve
these objectives by both its own efforts as well as cooperative efforts with the United States, Japan’s alliance
partner, and with the international community.

To this end, Japan will: support United Nations activities for international peace and security; make

diplomatic efforts to promote cooperative relationships with other countries; further develop its close
cooperative relationship with the United States, based on the Japan-U.S. Security Arrangements; establish a
basis for national security by preserving domestic political stability; and, develop efficient defense forces.

Based on the Constitution of Japan, and the ideas of maintaining the exclusively defense-oriented policy

by not becoming a military power that might pose a threat to other countries, Japan will continue to uphold
the fundamental principles of developing modest defense forces of its own under civilian control and will


-----

continue to adhere to the three non-nuclear principles.

To protect its territory and people against the threat of nuclear weapons, Japan will continue to rely on

the U.S. nuclear deterrent. At the same time, Japan will play an active role in creating a world free of nuclear
weapons by taking realistic step-by-step measures for nuclear disarmament and non-proliferation.

Japan also will play an active role in international disarmament and non-proliferation efforts regarding

other types of weapons of mass destruction and their delivery means, such as missiles.
2. Japan’s Own Efforts
(1) Basic Ideas

Based on the premise that any country’s security depends first and foremost on its own efforts, Japan
will utilize all appropriate means to prevent any threat from reaching the country. In addition, based on
the principle of acting closely with the international community and its alliance partner—the United
States—Japan will engage in diplomatic and other activities to improve the international security
environment so as to prevent the emergence of any new threats.
(2) Japan’s Integrated Response

In the event that these efforts fail to prevent a threat from reaching Japan, the Government of Japan will
take an integrated response by swiftly making appropriate decisions through mechanisms such as the
Security Council, and bringing together all relevant organizations. To this end, the Government will
improve its ability to collect and analyze information which serves as the basis of the Government’s
decision-making. The Self-Defense Forces, police, Japan Coast Guard and other relevant organizations
will improve their close cooperation through increased intelligence sharing, joint exercises, and other
activities, while appropriately sharing their roles, and improve their overall performances. In addition,
the Government will establish national protection systems including those for responding to different
types of disasters, by quickly issuing warning signals and promoting mutual cooperation between the
central and local governments.
(3) Japan’s Defense Forces

Japan’s defense forces are the ultimate guarantee of its national security, representing Japan’s will and
ability to repel any threat that might reach its shores.

Japan has developed its defense forces in accordance with the “National Defense Program Guidelines,

FY 2005-” (Security Council and Cabinet decision on November 28, 1995) which incorporated the key
elements of the Basic Defense Force Concept. The Basic Defense Force Concept espouses the idea
that, rather than preparing to directly counter a military threat, Japan, as an independent state, should
maintain the minimum necessary basic defense forces lest it becomes a destabilizing factor in the region
by creating a power vacuum. Combined with the Japan-U.S. Security Arrangements, this concept has
been successful in preventing an armed invasion from occurring.

Given the new security environment, however, future defense forces should be capable of effectively

responding to new threats and diverse situations while maintaining those elements of the Basic Defense
Force Concept that remain valid. Because the peace and stability of Japan is inextricably linked to
that of the international community, Japan should voluntarily and actively participate in activities
that nations of the world cooperatively undertake to enhance the international security environment
(hereinafter “international peace cooperation activities”).

In developing Japan’s defense forces, we have to take into account the fact that while the roles that

our defense forces have to play are multiplying, the number of young people in Japan is declining as a
result of the low birth rate, and fiscal conditions continue to deteriorate.

From this standpoint, Japan will develop multi-functional, flexible, and effective defense forces

that are highly ready, mobile, adaptable and multi-purpose, and are equipped with state-of-the-art


-----

technologies and intelligence capabilities measuring up to the military-technological level of other
major countries. In building such a defense force, without expanding its size, the Government of Japan
will rationalize and streamline personnel, equipment, and operations so as to attain greater results with
the limited resources that are available.
3. Japan-U.S. Security Arrangements
The Japan-U.S. Security Arrangements are indispensable in ensuring Japan’s security. In addition, the
U.S. military presence is critically important to peace and stability in the Asia-Pacific region, where
unpredictability and uncertainty continue to persist.

Close cooperative relations between Japan and the United States, based on the Japan-U.S. Security

Arrangements, play an important role in facilitating international efforts to prevent or to respond to new
threats and diverse situations, such as terrorism and ballistic missiles attacks.

Japan will proactively engage in strategic dialogue with the United States on wide-ranging security

issues such as role-sharing between the two countries and U.S. military posture, including the structure
of U.S. forces in Japan, while working to harmonize our perceptions of the new security environment and
appropriate strategic objectives.

In doing so, the Government of Japan will bear in mind the need to reduce the excessive burden that the

existence of U.S. military bases and facilities places on local communities, while maintaining the deterrent
that the U.S. military presence in Japan provides.

In addition, Japan will continue to strengthen the Japan-U.S. Security Arrangements by actively

promoting such measures as: intelligence exchange; operational cooperation, including in “situations in
areas surrounding Japan”; cooperation on ballistic missile defense; equipment and technology exchange;
and, efforts to make the stationing of U.S. forces in Japan smoother and more efficient.
4. Cooperation with the International Community
In order to improve the international security environment and help maintain security and prosperity of
Japan, the Government of Japan will actively engage in diplomatic efforts, including the strategic use of
Official Development Assistance (ODA).

Based on the recognition that the destabilization of the international community by events such as

regional conflicts, proliferation of weapons of mass destruction, and international terrorist attacks would
directly affect its own peace and security, Japan will, on its own initiative, actively participate in international
peace cooperation activities as an integral part of its diplomatic efforts.

In particular, stability in the region spreading from the Middle East to East Asia is critical to Japan.
Japan traditionally has close economic ties with this region, its sea lines of communication run through

the region, and Japan depends almost entirely on energy and natural resources from overseas. In this context,
Japan will strive to stabilize the region by promoting various cooperative efforts in conjunction with other
countries sharing common security challenges.

In order to enable the international community to effectively address the range of new issues in

the twenty-first century, measures must be taken to reform the world’s only global and comprehensive
international organization—the United Nations—to make it more effective and reliable. Japan will actively
pursue this goal.

In the Asia-Pacific region, multilateral frameworks for regional security, such as the ASEAN Regional

Forum (ARF), as well as multilateral efforts to deal with common agendas such as counter-terrorism and
counter-piracy are taking root. By continuing to support these positive developments, Japan will continue to
play an appropriate role, together with the cooperation with the United States, to promote a stable security
environment in the region.


-----

**IV. Future Defense Forces**
1. Role of the Defense Forces
Based on the recognition described above, Japan will develop and maintain, in an efficient manner, the
necessary Self-Defense Forces posture to effectively carry out missions in the following areas:
(1) Effective Response to the New Threats and Diverse Situations

Japan will deal effectively with the new threats and diverse situations by developing highly responsive
and mobile defense force units capable of responding properly to various different situations and by
deploying them appropriately in accordance with Japan’s geographical characteristics. Should such
a situation emerge, the defense forces will respond quickly and appropriately in smooth and close
collaboration with the police and other relevant organizations, thereby providing a seamless response
to the situation in accordance with circumstances and designated roles. Japan’s Self-Defense Forces
posture to address the key elements of the new threats and diverse situations will be as follows:
a. Response to Ballistic Missile Attacks

We will respond to ballistic missile attacks by establishing necessary defense force structure,
including the introduction of ballistic missile defense systems, to deal effectively with ballistic
missile attacks. We will adequately respond to the threat of nuclear weapons by doing so, in addition
to relying on U.S. nuclear deterrence.
b. Response to Guerrillas and Special Operations Forces Attacks

We will maintain necessary defense force structure to respond effectively to attacks carried out by
guerrillas and special operations forces. We will also enhance readiness and mobility of the defense
force units, and deal with such attacks in a flexible manner.
c. Response to the Invasion of Japan’s Offshore Islands

We will maintain necessary defense force structure to respond effectively to the invasion of Japan’s
offshore islands, improve and strengthen capabilities to transport and deploy forces, and deal with
the invasion in a flexible manner.
d. Patrol and Surveillance in the Sea and Airspace Surrounding Japan, and Response to the Violation

of Japan’s Airspace and the Intrusion of Armed Special-Purpose Ships and Other Similar Vessels
We will maintain necessary defense force structure, including ships, aircraft and other assets, to carry
out around-the-clock patrol and surveillance in the sea and airspace surrounding Japan. We will also
maintain fighter aircraft units to respond instantly to the violation of our territorial airspace, as well
as combatant ships and other assets in order to respond to armed special-purpose ships operating
in waters surrounding Japan, submerged foreign submarines operating in Japan’s territorial waters,
and other similar vessels.
e. Response to Large-Scale and/or Special-Type (Nuclear, Biological, Chemical, and Radiological)

Disasters
To deal effectively with large-scale and/or special-type (nuclear, biological, chemical, and
radiological) disasters, where protection of life and property is desperately needed, we will maintain
an adequate force structure with defense force units, as well as specialized capabilities and expertise
to conduct disaster relief operations in any part of Japan.
(2) Preparations to Deal with Full-Scale Invasion

Since in our judgment, the likelihood of full-scale invasion of Japan has declined and is expected to
remain modest in the foreseeable future, we will modify our current defense force building concept
that emphasized Cold War-type anti-tank warfare, anti-submarine warfare and anti-air warfare, and
will significantly reduce the personnel and equipment earmarked for a full-scale invasion. However,
because the original role of our defense forces is to cope with full-scale invasion and reconstructing


-----

these forces cannot be accomplished in a short period of time, Japan will continue to maintain the most
basic capabilities of its defense forces, while also taking into account developments in neighboring
countries and making use of technological progress.
(3) Proactive Efforts to Improve the International Security Environment

In order to engage actively in international peace cooperation activities, we will take the following
measures: develop education and training systems, highly responsive force posture for relevant units,
and transport and other required capabilities; establish necessary infrastructure to quickly dispatch
defense force units overseas and to carry out missions continuously; and, make necessary arrangements
to include the promotion of international peace cooperation activities in the Self-Defense Forces
mission priorities.

We will strongly promote activities for international peace and stability, including security

dialogue and defense exchanges, bilateral and multilateral training and exercises, and arms control and
disarmament efforts carried out by international organizations such as the United Nations.
2. Critical Elements of Our Defense Capabilities
Following are the critical elements for developing defense forces capable of carrying out the missions
described above.
(1) Enhancing Joint Operation Capabilities

In order to have the three services of the Self-Defense Forces work integrally and to enable them to
execute their missions swiftly and effectively, we will employ them jointly whenever possible. We
will create a central organization to facilitate joint operations, and establish infrastructure for training
and education as well as intelligence and communications. In doing so, we will reexamine existing
organizations so as to enhance their efficiency.
(2) Strengthening Intelligence Capabilities

In order to employ our defense forces successfully to respond effectively to the new threats and diverse
situations, it is imperative for the Government to be able to identify events at the earliest possible
time and to collect, analyze, and share intelligence promptly and accurately. For this purpose, we will
strengthen our diversified intelligence collection capability and enhance our comprehensive analysis
and assessment capability, keeping in mind the changes in the security environment and technological
trends. We will also strengthen the Self-Defense Forces’ intelligence structure, including the Defense
Intelligence Headquarters that supports our capabilities. In this way, we will build a sophisticated
intelligence capability.
(3) Incorporating the Progress in Science and Technology into Our Defense Forces

We will incorporate the outcome of science and technological progress, in such areas as information
and communications technologies, into our defense forces. In particular, we will develop the command
and control systems and agile intelligence sharing systems that are indispensable for joint operations, in
tune with information and communication technologies available at home and overseas.

In addition, we will create advanced systems for command and communications and a network for

information and communications, with sufficient protection against possible cyber attacks, to enhance
operational and organizational efficiency.
(4) Utilizing Human Resources More Efficiently

We will take various measures to maintain high morale and firm discipline within the Self-Defense
Forces. We will recruit, cultivate, train and educate high-quality personnel to meet the challenge of
the diversification and internationalization of Self-Defense Forces missions, and the need to properly
operate rapidly advancing high-tech equipment. In addition, we will promote activities related to
research and education on security issues, and develop human resources.

The defense force level required to fulfill missions described above is indicated in the attached table.

**V. Additional Elements for Consideration**
1. In developing, maintaining, and operating the defense forces as described in section IV, the following

elements will be taken into consideration.
(1) Mindful of increasingly severe fiscal conditions, we will restrict defense expenditures by further

rationalizing and streamlining defense forces. We will also work to make our defense forces successful
in carrying out their missions by harmonizing their operations with other measures taken by the
Government.
(2) We will make procurement and research and development (R&D) more effective and efficient

by taking the following measures: curbing lifecycle costs, including purchase price of defense
equipment; actively using cutting-edge technologies developed by private enterprises, universities, and
governmental organizations in carrying out R&D as well as by allocating R&D resources in a more
focused manner; and, appropriately and timely reviewing various R&D projects. At the same time, we
will work to establish defense production and technological bases, especially in core technological
areas indispensable for our national security.
(3) In order to efficiently develop and maintain defense-related facilities, the Government of Japan will, in

close cooperation with relevant local authorities, take various measures to make those facilities coexist
more harmoniously with local communities.
2. The National Defense Program Guidelines provide the vision for our defense forces for the next decade.
However, five years from now or in case there is a significant change in the international situation, we will
review and, if necessary, revise the Guidelines in light of the security environment, technological progress,
and other relevant factors at the time.

**Reference 9. Mid-Term Defense Program (FY 2005-2009)**

(Approved by the Security Council and the Cabinet on December 10, 2004)

**I. Policies for the Program**
From FY 2005 to FY 2009, the Government of Japan (GOJ) will build-up Japan’s defense forces based on
the following plan, in accordance with the “National Defense Program Guidelines, FY 2005-” (adopted by the
Security Council and the Cabinet on December 10, 2004. Hereinafter the new NDPG).
1. In order to effectively respond to new threats and diverse situations as well as to voluntarily and proactively

participate in activities that nations of the world cooperatively undertake to enhance the international
security environment (hereinafter “international peace cooperation activities”), the GOJ will efficiently
establish multi-functional, flexible and effective defense forces that are highly ready, mobile, adaptable
and multi-purpose, and are equipped with state-of-the-art technologies and intelligence capabilities, while
maintaining the most basic capabilities to cope with large-scale invasion.
2. Under the new security environment, the GOJ will review current organs of defense administration, and


-----

transfer the major units and main equipment of the Self-Defense Forces (SDF) to the new defense forces
prescribed in the new NDPG while reducing equipment and personnel earmarked for large-scale invasion.
3. In order to realize defense forces that are multi-functional, flexible and effective, the GOJ will advance
the critical elements of defense capabilities; strengthening joint operation capabilities and intelligence
capabilities while incorporating the progress in science and technology, and making effective use of human
resources as well.
4. In building, maintaining and operating defense forces, the GOJ will promote measures that support the
defense forces such as: procuring defense equipment more effectively and efficiently; and improving
cooperative ties with related administrative institutions and local communities.
5. The Japan-U.S. Security Arrangements are indispensable in ensuring Japan’s security. In addition, the U.S.
military presence is critically important to peace and stability in the Asia-Pacific region. Moreover, the close
cooperative relationship between Japan and the U.S. based on the Japan-U.S. Security Arrangements plays
an important role in facilitating international efforts in security fields. The GOJ will promote measures to
further strengthen the Japan-U.S. Security Arrangements and the close relations with the U.S. based on the
Arrangements.
6. Mindful of seriously deteriorating fiscal conditions, and with due consideration paid to other national
measures, the GOJ will restrict defense expenditures by further rationalizing and streamlining defense
forces.

**II. Review of the Organizations of Defense Agency and SDF**
1. The GOJ will review organization of defense administration including the Internal Bureau of Defense
Agency, and take necessary measures.
2. The GOJ will establish a new joint staff organization and transform each service Staff Office in order to
strengthen the joint operations. The GOJ will continue to study on whether or not further organizational
change is necessary for effective joint operations, and take necessary measures.
The GOJ will place the Defense Intelligence Headquarters under direct control of the Minister of State for
Defense.
3. Concerning the Ground Self-Defense Force (GSDF), the GOJ will: transform five Divisions, one Brigade
and two combined Brigades, among which a Division and two Combined Brigades are converted into
three Brigades, in order to improve readiness and mobility, while reducing number of tanks and artillery;
and establish the Central Readiness Force that administrates and operates units for nation-wide mobile
operations and special tasks. The authorized number of GSDF personnel will be around 161,000 persons
(152,000 persons for regular personnel and 8,000 persons for reservists) at the end of FY 2009. The actual
number of GSDF regular personnel will be approximately 146,000 at the end of FY 2009.
4. Concerning the Maritime Self-Defense Force, the GOJ will consolidate the number of the Escort divisions
of the Destroyer unit for mobile operations into eight, each of which is deployed four destroyers; and abolish
one of the Escort divisions for regional deployment. The GOJ also consolidate the number of divisions
of the Submarine unit into five, Flight Squadrons of Fixed-wings Patrol Aircraft unit into four and Patrol
Helicopter unit into five.
5. Concerning the Air Self-Defense Force, the GOJ will transform the Early Warning Group into that composed
with two squadrons. The GOJ will establish the first Aerial Refueling Transport Unit.


-----

**III. Major Plans Related to SDF Capabilities**
1. Effective Response to the New Threats and Diverse Situations
(1) Response to Ballistic Missile Attacks

The GOJ will improve the capabilities of the Aegis destroyers and Patriot surface-to-air missiles to enable
them to respond to ballistic missile attacks. The GOJ will study the course of capability improvement
for FY 2008 and after, taking into consideration the status of BMD technology development in the U.S.,
and take necessary measures.

The GOJ will also improve the Base Air Defense Ground Environment (BADGE), and start to

build-up a new warning and control radar which can detect and track ballistic missiles.

The GOJ will promote the joint Japan-U.S. technical research targeting the sea-based upper-tier

system, consider the possibility of transition to the development stage, and take necessary measures.
(2) Response to Attacks by Guerillas or Special Operations Units

In order to effectively respond to attacks by guerillas or special operations units, the GOJ will improve
the readiness and mobility of ground units, and strengthen the capability of infantries, and procure: light
armored vehicles; multi-purpose helicopters (UH-60JA, UH-1J); and combat helicopters (AH-64D).
The GOJ will also improve the capability to deal with nuclear, biological and/or chemical attacks.
(3) Response to Invasions of Japan’s Offshore Islands

In order to effectively respond to invasion of Japan’s offshore islands by improving transportation,
deployment and other capabilities, the GOJ will procure transport helicopters (CH-47JA/J), tanker
transport aircraft (KC-767), fighters (F-2) and new transport aircraft that will replace C-1s. The GOJ
will, based on actual operations and other matters, reconsider the total number of tanker-transport
aircraft, and will take necessary measures.

The GOJ will also improve rescuing capability by attaching transport aircraft (C-130H) the in-flight

refueling function for rescue helicopters (UH-60J).
(4) Patrol and Surveillance in the Sea and Airspace Surrounding Japan, and Response to Violation of

Japan’s Airspace or the Intrusion of Armed Special-Purpose Vessels
In order to patrol and survey in the sea and airspace surrounding Japan constantly and continuously, and
to deal properly with armed special-purpose ships or submerged foreign submarines navigating under
Japanese territorial sea, the GOJ will: procure destroyers (DDH and DD), patrol helicopters (SH-60K)
and minesweeper-transport helicopters (MCH-101); modernize early warning aircraft (E-2C) and the
air control and warning systems of the BADGE; procure new patrol aircraft that will replace P-3Cs: and
initiate the project to modernize early warning and control aircraft (E-767).

The GOJ will also promote the modernization of fighters (F-15), and procure new fighters that will

replace F-4s while restricting the total number of the procurement under the new NDPG.
(5) Response to Large-Scale and/or Special-Type Disasters

In order to effectively respond to large-scale and/or special-type disasters and other situations that
demand protection of human lives and properties in cooperation with related institutions, the GOJ will
take measures to help the SDF units improve necessary capabilities.
2. Preparations to Deal with Large-Scale Invasion of Japan

Since the likelihood of large-scale invasion of Japan is expected to remain modest in the foreseeable
future, the GOJ will modify the current defense force building concept that emphasized anti-tank warfare,
anti-submarine warfare, and anti-air warfare, and will downsize equipment and personnel earmarked for a
large-scale invasion. At the same time, because reconstructing defense forces cannot be accomplished in a
short period of time, while taking into accounts developments in neighboring countries and making use of
technological progress, the GOJ will continue to procure tanks, artillery, mid-range surface-to-air missiles,


-----

destroyers, submarines, minesweepers, patrol aircraft, fighters, and so on.
3. Voluntary and Proactive Efforts to Improve the International Security Environment
(1) Appropriate Effort for International Peace Cooperation Activities

In order to send units quickly to international peace cooperation activities and sustain the operation,
the GOJ will: establish a unit for education and research for international peace cooperation activities;
expand and improve the current rotating standby posture; and procure equipment for international
peace cooperation activities.
(2) Enhancement of Security Dialogue, Defense Exchanges and Co-Training/Exercises with Other

Countries
The GOJ will promote measures for bilateral or multilateral security dialogue and defense exchanges
by positively promoting defense exchanges of each level and participating in international peace
cooperation activities such as Proliferation Security Initiative (PSI) and joint exercises for rescue and
other objectives. The GOJ will also take part in efforts in the areas of arms control and disarmament led
by international organizations including the United Nations (U.N.).
4. Critical Elements of Defense Capabilities
(1) Strengthening Joint Operation Capabilities

In addition to creating a new joint staff organization and reorganizing service Staff Office as mentioned
in section II above, the GOJ will reorganize the Joint Staff College, conduct joint exercises, establish
common information and communication infrastructure, and take other measures to build foundations
for the joint operations.
(2) Strengthening Intelligence Capabilities

The GOJ will strengthen the capability of intelligence sections such as the Defense Intelligence
Headquarters by securing and training able personnel and enhancing measures for gathering and
analyzing various intelligence including signal and geospatial intelligence. The GOJ will modernize
Electronic Intelligence Aircraft (EP-3), and start tentative modification for converting some of the F-15
fighters to reconnaissance aircraft.

In addition, the GOJ will take necessary measures, upon consideration, with regard to unmanned

aerial vehicles of high altitude and endurance.
(3) Incorporation of the Progress in Science and Technology into Defense Forces
a. Strengthening Command and Control Capability, etc.

In order to have credible command and control and swift information sharing that are indispensable
for joint operations and smooth implementation of international peace cooperation activities with
enhanced operational and organizational efficiency, the GOJ will establish advanced command and
communication systems and information and communication network in tune with information and
communication technologies available at home and overseas, thereby concentrating and circulating
information through chains of command, sharing intelligence at the unit level, strengthening
capability to respond cyber attacks and enhancing information sharing with relevant organizations
and other entities.
b. Promoting Research and Development

The GOJ will promote development of next generation aircraft that will replace P-3Cs and C-1s, and
next generation tank. The GOJ will promote, taking into account trends of science and technology,
research and development (R&D) of various command and control systems, unmanned aerial
vehicles, and other equipments, with focused distribution of resources. In the meantime, the GOJ
will make efforts for effective and efficient implementation of R&D by proactively introducing
advanced technology of industrial, governmental and academic sectors, using modeling and


-----

simulation methods, using the same parts or components for different equipment, and promoting
cooperation with the U.S. and other nations.

Furthermore, the GOJ will review methods for focused investment in R&D, and the organization

of the Technical Research and Development Institute, and take necessary measures.
(4) Effective Utilization of Human Resources
a. Enhancement of Measures for Personnel, Education and Training

The GOJ will take various measures for maintaining high morale and strict discipline of personnel.
The GOJ will secure and raise SDF personnel of high quality through increasing young officers
endowed with flexible judgment and other means, and also enhancing education and training so
that the SDF can better respond to diversified and internationalized missions, advanced defense
equipment and joint operations.

The GOJ will also consider effective way of utilization of retired personnel in the society, and

take necessary measures.
b. Promotion of Research and Education Regarding Security Issues

The GOJ will improve the research and education function of the National Institute for Defense
Studies regarding security policy. The GOJ will enhance human basis by personnel exchanges in
security area.
5. Measures to Support Defense Capability
(1) Streamlined and Efficient Acquisition of Equipment

The GOJ will strengthen efforts to curb lifecycle cost of equipments including cost of procurement,
with a concrete target to achieve. The GOJ will promote general procurement reform and take necessary
measures, such as establishing an efficient procurement and replenishment posture which can cope with
diverse situations and establishing the truly necessary defense industrial and technological basis, the
center of which constitutes core technological areas indispensable for national security.
(2) Promotion of Cooperation with Relevant Administrative Organizations and Local Communities

The GOJ will improve coordination with the relevant organizations such as police, fire department,
and the Coast Guard, and promote cooperation with local governments and local communities with the
Civil Protection Law as its basis.

In addition, the GOJ will efficiently maintain and develop defense-related facilities. In order to

make those facilities coexist more harmoniously with local communities, the GOJ will continue to
promote measures for local communities surrounding those facilities under close cooperation with local
governments.

**IV. Measures to Strengthen the Japan-U.S. Security Arrangements**
1. Exchanges of Intelligence and Policy Consultations
The GOJ will promote exchanges of intelligence and views regarding international situations, and maintain
strategic dialogue with the U.S. on wide-ranging security issues such as role-sharing between the two
countries and the military posture that includes force structure of the U.S. Forces in Japan (USFJ), bearing
in mind the need to reduce the excessive burden that U.S. military bases and facilities place on local
communities, while maintaining the deterrent that the U.S. military presence in Japan provides.
2. Operational Cooperation and Bilateral Exercise/Training
Based on the outcome of the strategic dialogue, the GOJ will make efforts to build an effective posture for
operational cooperation, and expand bilateral exercise/training.
3. Promotion of Cooperation based on Ballistic Missile Defense (BMD)
The GOJ will strengthen Japan-U.S. bilateral efforts to enhance ballistic missile defense (BMD) capabilities,


-----

and promote cooperation with the U.S. in the fields of defense policy, operations, and equipment and
technology.
4. Equipment and Technology Exchanges
The GOJ will make efforts to enhance broad mutual exchanges including joint R&D projects with the U.S.
in the area of equipment and technology.
5. Promotion of Efforts to Make the Stationing of the USFJ Smooth and Effective
The GOJ will take measures to make the stationing of the USFJ smooth and efficient, such as support to
the stationing of the USFJ and realignment, consolidation, and reduction of USFJ facilities and areas in
Okinawa, while engaging in strategic dialogue with the U.S. regarding force structure of the USFJ on its
own initiative and continuously maintaining the deterrent that the U.S. military presence in Japan provides.
6. Enhancement of Japan-U.S. Cooperation concerning International Measures for Regional or Global
Security
The GOJ will take measures to closely cooperate with the U.S. and proactively participate in international
activities to prevent or to tackle new threats and diverse situations such as the fight against terrorism and the
Proliferation Security Initiative (PSI).

**V. Size of Procurement**
Regarding the size of equipment procurement as described in the preceding section III (Major Plans related to
SDF Capabilities), specific numbers of main equipment procurement are shown in the attached table.

**VI. Expenses Required**
1. The limit of the total amount of defense-related expenditures needed for this program is approximately

24.24 trillion yen at the prices of FY 2005.
2. In the annual budget formulation process, the GOJ will decide it within the framework of the expenditures

required by this Program, while achieving harmony with other Government measures by seeking further
efficiency and rationalization. In case of needs to respond to an unforeseeable situation in the future, extra
budget, besides the defense-related expenditures shown in I, might be provided within the limit of 100
billion yen on the condition that the Security Council of Japan would approve.

The GOJ will continue to respect the spirit of seeking a moderate defense build-up as stated in the

“Program for the Future Build-up of Defense Capability” (adopted by the Security Council and the Cabinet
on January 24, 1987).
3. Within the limit of the total amount of expenditures to this program, the program will be reviewed if necessary

in three years from now, considering various factors in and outside Japan including international situations
prevailing at that time, global trends in technology such as information and communication technology and
Japan’s fiscal condition.

**VII. Others**
1. The GOJ will review the modality of defense forces stated in the new NDPG to make necessary changes,
in five years or when serious situational changes emerge, taking into account the security environment and
technological trends at the time.
2. The GOJ will steadily implement projects related to the Special Action Committee on Okinawa (SACO).
The costs required for their implementation will be separately identified.

**Reference 10. Statement by the Chief Cabinet Secretary**

(December 10, 2004)

1. The Government of Japan approved the “National Defense Program Guidelines, FY 2005-” (the new NDPG)
and the “Mid-Term Defense Program, FY 2005-FY 2009” at the Security Council and the Cabinet Meeting
today.
2. In light of the new threats and diverse situations presented by today’s security environment, including the
proliferation of weapons of mass destruction and ballistic missiles, international terrorism, and other various
situations that affect peace and security, the Government has developed the new NDPG in recognition of the
need to set new guidelines for shaping Japan’s future security and defense.
3. The new NDPG spell out both Japan’s vision for future defense forces as well as the basic principles of its
security policy which underlie that vision. Japan has two basic security policy objectives: (a) to prevent any
threat from reaching Japan and, in the event that it does, to repel it; and (b) to improve the international
security environment in order to prevent any threat from reaching Japan in the first place.

The new NDPG make it clear that, in particular, improving the international security environment is

one of the major pillars of the security policy of Japan, whose prosperity and growth depend heavily on the
security of sea lines of communication.

The new NDPG point out that it is necessary to achieve these goals by both its own efforts as well


-----

as cooperative efforts with the United States, Japan’s alliance partner, as well as with the international
community. At the same time, we will continue to firmly uphold the basic principles of our defense policy
that we have ascribed to in accordance with the Constitution of Japan.
4. In implementing this policy, the Government of Japan will employ all available means to prevent any threat
from reaching the country. Should a threat reach Japan, the Government will take an integrated response,
swiftly making appropriate decisions, bringing together all relevant organizations, and having them cooperate
fully. The new NDPG have clearly stated that relevant organizations such as the Self-Defense Forces, the
police, and the Japan Coast Guard will utilize all available means and work closely together to protect Japan
and its people. In addition, as a part of its own effort, Japan will engage in diplomatic and other activities
to improve the international security environment so as to prevent the emergence of any threats. Japan’s
defense forces—the ultimate guarantee of its national security—should be capable of effectively responding
to any new threats and diverse situations, while inheriting the elements of the Basic Defense Force Concept
that still remain valid. Japan’s defense forces should also be capable of actively participating in international
peace cooperation activities in order to improve the international security environment. While roles that
the defense forces have to play are multiplying and fiscal conditions continue to deteriorate, Japan’s future
defense forces should be multi-functional, flexible, and effective while, at the same time, more rationalized
and streamlined.

The Japan-U.S. Security Arrangements are indispensable to the security of Japan as well as the peace

and stability in the Asia-Pacific region. Based on the Arrangements, close cooperative relations between
Japan and its alliance partner, the United States, play an important role in facilitating international efforts to
effectively address new threats and diverse situations. Japan will proactively engage in strategic dialogue
with the United States on wide-ranging security issues such as role-sharing between the two countries
and U.S. military posture, including the U.S. force structure in Japan, while working to harmonize our
perceptions of the new security environment and appropriate strategic objectives in it.

Regarding its cooperation with the international community, Japan will utilize its Official Development

Assistance (ODA) strategically and actively participate in international peace cooperation activities. The
new NDPG have clearly defined these activities as part of our effort to improve the international security
environment.
5. Regarding the future defense force, Japan will develop highly responsive and mobile defense forces
capable of dealing effectively with new threats and diverse situations, and deploy them appropriately in
accordance with Japan’s geographical characteristics. Japan’s future defense forces should be capable of
coping with ballistic missile attacks, attacks carried out by guerrillas and special operations forces, and
invasion of offshore islands. They should also be able to execute patrol and surveillance in the sea and
airspace surrounding Japan, and respond to the violation of airspace, the intrusion of armed special purpose
ships and other similar vessels, and large-scale and/or special-type (nuclear, biological, chemical, and
radiological) disasters. Should such a situation emerge, the defense forces will respond in smooth and close
collaboration with the police and other relevant organizations, thereby providing a seamless response to
the situation in accordance with circumstances and designated roles. In our judgment, the likelihood of a
full-scale invasion of Japan has declined and will remain modest for the foreseeable future. Thus, based
on a fundamental review, we have decided to reduce the personnel and equipment earmarked for coping
with such a contingency. However, because the original role of our defense forces is to cope with fullscale invasion and reconstructing these forces cannot be accomplished in a short period of time, Japan
will continue to maintain the most basic capabilities of its defense forces, while also taking into account
developments in neighboring countries and making use of technological progress. In our effort to improve
the international security environment, we will establish infrastructure and make necessary arrangements


-----

to engage in international peace cooperation activities. Japan will continue to strongly promote activities
conducive to international peace and stability, such as security dialogue and defense exchanges.
6. We will continue to firmly maintain our policy of dealing with arms exports control carefully, in light of
Japan’s basic philosophy as a peace-loving nation on which the Three Principles on Arms Exports and their
related policy guidelines are based.

If Japan decides that it will engage in joint development and production of ballistic missile defense

systems with the United States, however, the Three Principles will not be applied, under the condition
that strict control is maintained, because such systems and related activities will contribute to the effective
operation of the Japan-U.S. Security Arrangements and are conducive to the security of Japan.

In addition, through the process by which the NDPG were developed, questions were raised regarding

how to handle cases of joint development and production with the United States (other than those related
to the ballistic missile defense system) as well as those related to support of counter-terrorism and
counter-piracy.

Decisions will be made on the basis of individual examination of each case, in light of Japan’s basic

philosophy as a peace-loving nation that aims at avoiding the escalation of international conflicts.
7. Based on the new NDPG, the Government will devise Japan’s vision for international peace cooperation
activities, and take legal and other necessary measures concerning Japan’s security and defense policy,
including placement of international peace cooperation activities in Self-Defense Forces’ mission priorities,
and operational issues pertaining to the ballistic missile defense systems.
8. To clearly indicate the target period in which the planned defense force level will be achieved, the new
NDPG provide the vision for our defense forces for the next decade. In addition, in order to better adjust our
defense policy to the changing security environment, we will review and, if necessary, revise the NDPG in
five years.
9. The “Mid-Term Defense Program, FY 2005-FY 2009” was formulated to achieve the defense forces level that
Japan should possess as provided for in the new NDPG. We expect the total defense-related budget for the
new Mid-Term Defense Program to be approximately ¥24,240 billion measured in constant FY 2004 yen.
10. The Government of Japan will report today’s decision to the Diet. I would sincerely hope that the people of

Japan will understand and give their support to the decision.

**Reference 11. The Three Principles on Arms Export, etc.**

❍ The export of “arms” needs a license from the Minster of Economy, Trade and Industry pursuant to the

Foreign Exchange and Foreign Trade Control Law (Law 228, 1949) (Note) and the Export Trade Control
Order (Ordinance No. 378, 1949).

Note: Now known as the Foreign Exchange and Foreign Trade Law.

**1. The Three Principles on Arms Export**
On April 21, 1967, then Prime Minister Eisaku Sato declared the Three Principles at the House of Representatives’
Audit Committee meeting.
(Summary)
The Principles provide that arms export to the following countries shall not be permitted:
(1) Communist Bloc countries;
(2) Countries to which arms export is prohibited under the U.N. resolutions; or
(3) Countries which are actually involved or likely to become involved in international conflicts.


-----

**2. The Government’s Unified View on Arms Export**
On February 27, 1976, then Prime Minister Takeo Miki announced the Government’s view at the House of
Representatives’ Budget Committee meeting.
(Full text)
(1) The Government’s Policy

With regard to the export of “arms,” the Government, from the standpoint of Japan as a pacifist country,
has always been dealing with the problems of arms export in a cautious manner to avoid the escalation of
international conflict. The Government will continue to deal with such matters pursuant to the following
policy and will not promote arms export.
(i) The export of “arms” to the areas subject to the Three Principles shall not be permitted.
(ii) The export of “arms” to areas other than the areas subject to the Three Principles shall be restrained in

line with the spirit of the Constitution and the Foreign Exchange and Foreign Trade Control Law.
(iii) Equipment related to arms production (Export Trade Control Order, Separate Table 1, Section No. 109,

etc.) shall be treated in the same category as “arms.”
(2) Definition of Arms

The term “arms” is used in different laws and regulations or in terms of application, and its definition should
be interpreted in accordance with the purpose of that law or regulation.
(i) Arms referred to in the Three Principles on Arms Export are “those that are used by the military forces

and directly employed in combat.” Specifically “arms” are those that are listed in Items from No. 197
to No. 205 in the Annexed List 1 of the Export Trade Control Order and are consistent with the above
definition.
(ii) “Arms” under the Self-Defense Forces Law are interpreted as “firearms, explosives, swords and other

machines, equipment and devices aimed at killing and injuring people or destroying things as means

Notes: 1. Data sources are national budget books, defense white papers and others.
2. % represents a rate of growth over the previous year.

3. U.S. defense expenditures represent the expense narrowly defined by the historical table FY 2008.

4. The figures for the United Kingdom up to FY 2006 are based on U.K. Defense Statistics published by Ministry of Defense. The figure in FY 2007 is

the expected amount announced in the budget message.

5. The German defense expenditures rose sharply in FY 2006 because the data began to include pension expenditures. The defense expenditures

actually decreased by 0.7% in comparison with FY 2005 when the pension expenditures are excluded.

6. Data for China is based on the Finance Minister’s Budget Report to the National People’s Congress. For the National Defense Budget 2004, China’s

fiscal report stated national defense expenditures would increase, “11.6% by 21.83 billion yuan.” The total expenditures, however, have not been
revealed. As there is a discrepancy in the calculation made on the figures in the said report based on the FY 2003 defense budget, calculations are
made based on the assumed actual expenditure amounts in 2001 and 2003 (unpublished).

7. According to tables and analyses in part two of Military Balance 2008 outlining an international comparison of defense expenditures and military

manpower defense expenditures for FY 2006 were: U.S. $535,943 million, U.K. $55,444 million, Germany $37,775 million, France $54,003 million, Russia $70,000 million, China $121,872 million and Japan $41,144 million.

**Reference 23. Statement by the Chief Cabinet Secretary on the Joint Japan-U.S.**

**Technical Research on the Ballistic Missile Defense (BMD)**

(December 25, 1998)

1. Today, on the approval by the Security Council of Japan, the Government of Japan decided to launch joint
technical research with the United States of America on the Navy’s Theater Wide Defense (NTWD) System
starting in FY 1999.
2. Given the trend of proliferation of nuclear weapons and other weapons of mass destruction and ballistic
missiles after the end of the Cold War, the government considers that the issue of the ballistic missile defense
(BMD) is a crucial one for Japan’s defense policies that rely exclusively on a defense-oriented defense
policy and that Japan should actively lead the issue of BMD. Thus, we have been making necessary studies
and discussions on the issue.
3. The Government of Japan considers that launching joint Japan-U.S. technical research on NTWD is the
most effective as well as most productive measure the government should take in the future and that such
cooperation between Japan and the United States will contribute to the improvement of reliability of the
Japan-U.S. Security Arrangements.
4. While there is no doubt that the official interpretation of the Diet resolutions should be carried out by
the Diet itself, the Government of Japan takes the position on the relevance of this matter with the Diet
resolution on development and use of the outer space as follows. Considering the recent situation where
ballistic missiles are on the trend of proliferation, and the fact that BMD system is an inherently defensive
as well as unsubstitutable and only measure to protect the lives and properties of the people of Japan, the
Government of Japan determines that active involvement of Japan in the BMD system agrees with the
purport of the Diet resolution concerned and the basic policy of Japan as a peaceful nation, which the purport
of the resolution relies on. Thereby the Government also determines that the people will understand and
support our decision.

It should be noted that the Diet resolution of September this year by the lower house regarding the

ballistic missile launch by North Korea states: “The Government will take every measure to ensure the
safety of the people of the nation.”

It should also be noted that technical transfer of weapons related to BMD will be carried out within the

framework of the agreements on the technical transfer of the weapons to the United States.
5. This resolution refers only to the technical research and not to the transition of the government action to the
stages of development and/or deployment of such weapons, which should be determined separately. Such
determination will be made upon thorough review of technical feasibility of the BMD and the visions of the
Japan’s defense policies in the future.

**Reference 24. Preparation of Ballistic Missile Defense System, etc.**

(Adopted by the Security Council of Japan and approved by the Cabinet on December 19, 2003)

**(Preparation of Ballistic Missile Defense System)**
1. On the issue of the ballistic missile defense (BMD), under the recognition that Japan should take active
measures on the issue given the advancement of proliferation of weapons of mass destruction and ballistic
missiles, the Mid-Term Defense Program (FY 2001 to FY 2005) (hereinafter “MTDP”), which was adopted by


-----

the Security Council of Japan and approved by the Cabinet on December 15, 2003, stipulates that “necessary
measures will be taken upon the review of its technical feasibility.” As recent tests of various kinds have
confirmed the high technical feasibility of the BMD, development of the BMD system has become feasible
upon the improvement of capacities and joint operation of the existing Aegis system-equipped destroyers
and the surface-to-air Patriot guided missile system. Thus, considering that the BMD system is inherently
defensive as well as unsubstitutable and is the only measure to protect the lives and properties of the people
of Japan against ballistic missile attacks, the system agrees with Japan’s exclusively defense-oriented policy.
Consequently, the Government of Japan is determined to equip the nation with the same system.

**(Review of Japan’s Defense Capabilities)**
2. Regarding the security environment surrounding Japan, while large-scale invasion by a third country into
Japan has become less likely, measures against the increasing proliferation of weapons of mass destruction
and ballistic missiles, activities of international terrorist groups and other types of new forms of threats
as well as diverse contingencies that are likely to have a negative impact on the peace and security of the
nation (hereinafter “the new threats, etc.”) has been urgently needed for the international community. For
the peace and stability of the nation and the international community, Japan also needs to take all possible
measures against such new threats, etc. through comprehensive and prompt responses under the organic
coordination of diplomatic effort promotion, effective operation of defense forces and other measures, while
firmly maintaining the Japan-U.S. Security Arrangements. When such new security environment and the
introduction of the BMD system are considered, we come to a conclusion that the whole defense capacities
of Japan need to be reviewed.

To this end, we will make effectual measures against the new threats, etc. according to the specific features

of each of them while maintaining close cooperation with concerned agencies and local communities, further
developing cooperative relationship with the United States based on the Japan-U.S. Security Arrangements,
and promoting cooperation with neighboring nations and other nations and international organizations
concerned. At the same time, the Government of Japan will review the whole defensive capacities of
Japan in order to prepare for proactive and affirmative actions that are to be taken to protect the peace
and stability of the international community to which Japan belongs. In so doing, preparation of necessary
schemes that can effectually deal with the new threats, etc., including terrorist attacks and ballistic missile
attacks, will be prepared, and at the same time the current defense build-up concept and equipment system
will be fundamentally reviewed and appropriate down-sizing will be made, while taking events of largescale invasion into consideration. These actions are to build defense forces that are capable of effectively
responding to the new security environment.

Based on the views described above, when renewing the current system of the Self-Defense Forces into

a new system, we will pursue the improvement of readiness, mobility, flexibility and multipurpose functions
of the system as well as highly advanced technical capabilities and intelligence capabilities, and at the
same time we will carry out a fundamental review of the existing organizations, equipment and other items
concerned in order to improve their efficiencies. In so doing, the following items will be focused in order to
establish an effectual system.
(1) The current organizations and alike will be reviewed, and new organizations, including an advisory

organization to the Defense Minister, necessary for the operation of the Self-Defense Forces that centers
on joint operation, will be formed.
(2) As for the major units of the Ground, Maritime and Air Self-Defense Forces, new schemes, including a

new organization, will be constructed in order that effectual measures may be taken in the event of new
threats, etc.


-----

(3) Necessary functions, organizations and equipments will be prepared in order to readily take actions that

effectively contribute to the peace and security of the international community.
(4) In order to prepare for the unexpected change of the security situations in the future, while securely

retaining the fundamental components to respond to events of large-scale invasion and concerning the
security situations of the surrounding area of Japan, the following measures will be taken.
a. Regarding the Ground Self-Defense Force, a defense build-up concept focused on anti-tank
warfare will be developed, and a system that can promptly respond to the new threats, etc.
will be prepared through improvement of mobility and other capabilities, while the current
situation of tanks, artilleries and other weapons will be reviewed and appropriate downsizing
will be made.
b. Regarding the Maritime Self-Defense Force, the defense build-up concept will be altered to
one that is focused on anti-submarine warfare, and preparation of a responding system to
ballistic missiles and other new threats, etc. will be attempted, while the current situation of
destroyers, fixed-wing patrol aircraft and other equipment will be reviewed and appropriate
downsizing will be made.
c. Regarding the Air Self-Defense Force, the current defense force build-up concept focused
on the anti-combat aircraft warfare will be modified to better prepare for ballistic missile and
other new threats, etc. At the same time, the current situation of combat aircraft and other
equipment will be reviewed and appropriate downsizing and other measures will be taken.

**(Defense-related Expenditures)**
3. When carrying out such a large-scale program as the BMD system preparation, the Government of Japan

will carry out a fundamental review of the existing organizations and equipment of the Self-Defense Forces
based on the items described above (see 2) in order to improve the efficiency, and, at the same time, make
efforts to reduce defense-related expenditures to take the harsh economic and fiscal conditions of Japan into
consideration. Based on such views, the government will lay down a new Mid-Term Defense Program that
will replace the current program by the end of 2004 and determine the limit of the total amount needed for
the same program.

**(Formulation of New Defense Program Guidelines)**
4. As a precursor to the formulation of a new Mid-Term Defense Program, the Government of Japan will

formulate new National Defense Program Guidelines that will replace the National Defense Program
Guidelines from FY 1996 (adopted by the Security Council of Japan and the Cabinet on November 28,
1995). The new Guidelines will be formulated to adopt the system to the new security environment and
follow the concepts described above (see 1 and 2). We also aim to stipulate our visions for Japan’s defense
forces, including the position of Japan’s Self-Defense Forces in activities to maintain the peace and stability
of the international community.

**Reference 25. Statement of the Chief Cabinet Secretary of Japan on the Cabinet**

**Decision, “On Introduction of Ballistic Missile Defense System and Other**
**Measures”**

 (December 19, 2003)

1. The Government of Japan decided “On Introduction of Ballistic Missile Defense System and Other

Measures” at the Security Council of Japan and the Cabinet today. This decision shows the thinking behind
the introduction of BMD system, and at the same time, indicates the direction of Japan’s defense force
review taking into account the introduction of BMD system and the new security environment. Based on
this decision, the Government of Japan will formulate a new National Defense Program Outline and a new
Mid-Term Defense Program by the end of the year 2004.
2. The Government of Japan, recognizing that rapid progress on the relevant technologies of BMD has recently

been made and that technological feasibility of BMD system is high, and noting that BMD system is suitable
for our exclusively defense-oriented policy, decided to introduce the multi-tier defense system based on the
Aegis BMD system and Patriot PAC-3 (Patriot Advanced Capability-3).
3. The technical feasibility of the BMD system has been confirmed with the results from interception tests

and other capability tests carried out by the United States as well as with the Japan’s original simulation
experiments. Therefore, we concluded that technical reliability of these systems is considerably high and
the technology has reached a sufficiently high level for practical use as we can see from the decision by the
United States on the primary deployment.
4. BMD system is the only purely defensive measure, without alternatives, to protect life and property of the

citizens of Japan against ballistic missile attacks, and meets the principle of exclusively defense-oriented
policy. Therefore, it is considered that this presents no threat to neighboring countries, and does not affect
the regional stability.
5. As for the issue of the right of collective self-defense, the BMD system that the Government of Japan is

introducing aims at the defense of Japan. It will be operated based on Japan’s independent judgment, and
will not be used for the purpose of defending third countries. Therefore, it does not raise any problems with
regard to the issue of the right of collective self-defense. The BMD system requires interception of missiles
by Japan’s own independent judgment based on the information on the target acquired by Japan’s own
sensors.
6. In legal terms on the operation of the BMD system, interception of ballistic missile attack is basically

conducted as a defense operation that is undertaken in situations regarded as an armed attack against Japan.
In addition, due to the nature of ballistic missiles and the characteristics of BMD, the Government will
conduct specific studies on necessary measures including legal ones, which enable appropriate responses to
each situation.
7. The joint Japan-U.S. technical research currently underway is not for the system being introduced this time,

but it aims to improve the capability of future interceptor. It remains important to carry on the research in
order to take all possible measures to ensure national defense. The future transition to the development and
deployment stage will be decided separately, taking international situations of the time and other factors into
consideration.
8. Japan will take all possible measures to ensure national defense and prevention of proliferation of weapons

of mass destruction, by ensuring transparency and encouraging international understanding on BMD, and
by promoting further cooperation with the United States on technology and operation.

**Reference 26. Statement by the Chief Cabinet Secretary “Japan-U.S. Cooperative**

**Development of Advanced SM-3 Missile for Ballistic Missile Defense”**
**(tentative translation)**

 (December 24, 2005)

1. The Government of Japan, through today’s meetings of the Security Council of Japan and the Cabinet,

decided to initiate Japan-U.S. joint development of advanced SM-3 missile for Ballistic Missile Defense.
2. The Government of Japan has started and promoted Japan-U.S. joint technical research on a sea-based upper
tier system since 1999 with the understanding that BMD system is the only and purely defensive measure,
without alternatives, to protect the lives and properties of Japanese citizens against ballistic missile attacks
and meets the principles of exclusively defense-oriented policy, in an environment marked by proliferation
of weapons of mass destruction and ballistic missiles. This research does not aim at the BMD system which
Japan started to introduce since FY 2004, but aims to improve the future capabilities of interceptors in order
to expand all possible means to ensure Japan’s national defense.
3. The “Mid-Term Defense Program (FY 2005-2009)” states “the Government of Japan will consider the

possibility of transition to the development stage, and take necessary measures.” Based on the results of
Japan-U.S. joint technical research to date, the Government of Japan has sufficient prospect for solving the
initial technical challenges. In the current international situation, taking into consideration the continuing
fiscal constraint, we consider it appropriate to promote Japan-U.S. joint development of advanced SM3 missiles efficiently in order to acquire the capability against future ballistic missile threats. Future
transition to the deployment stage of the advanced missile will be decided based on the results of the joint
development.
4. Regarding the relation with the Three Principles on Arms Export, “Statement by the Chief Cabinet

Secretary” for National Defense Program Guidelines, FY 2005- (approved by the Security Council of Japan
and the Cabinet on December 10, 2004), states “if Japan decides that it will engage in joint development
and production of ballistic missile defense systems with the United States, however, the Three Principles on
Arms Exports will not be applied, under the condition that strict control is maintained, because such systems
and related activities will contribute to the effective operation of the Japan-U.S. Security Arrangements and
are conductive to the security of Japan.” We will continue to firmly maintain our policy of dealing with arms
exports control carefully, in light of Japan’s basic philosophy as a peace-loving nation on which the Three
Principles on Arms Exports and their related policy guidelines are based.

Based on these, arms that need to be provided to the United States for the Japan-U.S. joint development

will be provided under strict control after coordinating with the United States in the future on the framework
for arms transfer.
5. Japan will continue to ensure the transparency and increase international understanding of its BMD system
while further promoting cooperation in the areas of policy, operation and equipment/technology with the
United States. Through these efforts, Japan will strive to take all possible measures in ensuring its national
defense and preventing the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction and ballistic missiles.

**Reference 30. Basic Guidelines for the Protection of Civilians (Outline)**

**Introduction**
The Law Concerning Measures to Ensure the Peace and Security of Japan in Situations in Areas Surrounding
Japan was enacted in June 2003. The law stipulates basic response measures in the event of armed attacks against
Japan from foreign countries. Enacted in June 2004 following the enactment of the situation law was the Civil
Protection Law, which stipulates necessary measures to be taken to protect civilian lives, their bodies and their
assets from armed attacks in situations including one in which Japan comes under armed attack. Meanwhile,
the Cabinet approved the National Defense Program Outline (NDPO) in December 2004. The national security
goal set under the NDPO is to prevent any threat from reaching Japan and, in the event that it does, repel it and
minimize any damage and to improve the international security environment so as to reduce the chances that any
threat will reach Japan in the first place. Under this background, basic guidelines are to be set based on Article
32 of the Civil Protection Law.

**Chapter 1 Basic Policy Concerning Implementation of Measures for Protecting Civilians**
The state, local governments, designated state-run public institutions and designated local public institutions do
their utmost in order to implement measures for protecting civilians appropriately and expeditiously in line with the
Civil Protection Law, other laws, basic guidelines, civil protection plan undertaken by designated administrative
institutions and prefectures, and the civil protection plan undertaken by designated public institutions while
taking the following points into consideration.
1) Respecting fundamental human rights, limiting the scope of restrictions on citizens’ freedom and rights to
minimum necessary levels, and implementing measures under fair and adequate procedures
2) Ensuring procedures and adequately managing documents to enable relief measures to be taken in an
expeditious manner for protection of citizens’ rights and profits
3) Providing citizens with accurate information on situations about armed attacks at an appropriate timing and
in an appropriate manner
4) Ensuring the establishment of relations of mutual cooperation among the state, local governments and
designated state-run public institutions, and ensuring the promotion of cooperation among local governments,
the Defense Ministry and the SDF when taking measures including requesting SDF units to be dispatched to
engage in civil protection activities
5) Implementing educational and enlightenment measures, improving activities by firefighting groups and
voluntarily formed disaster-prevention organizations, and seeking citizens’ support and cooperation in
activities by volunteering groups
6) Respecting the independence of the Red Cross Society of Japan, giving special consideration to freedom
of expression in speech and others by broadcasting business operators, and respecting the independence of
designated state-run public institutions and designated local public institutions
7) When issuing warnings, guiding people for evacuation and engaging in rescue operations, special
considerations are to be given to people needing special protection measures, such as aged people and
handicapped people. When information is collected on the safety of foreign nationals, adequate measures
are to be taken based on international laws concerning humanitarian protection
8) Safety measures are to be implemented sufficiently for parties in charge of implementing civil protection steps,
transportation services operators, people providing medical services, parties managing livelihood-related
facilities and running livelihood-related facilities, and parties providing cooperation in implementation of
civil protection measures
9) Measures to revise initial instructions issued by the Prime Minister when governors of concerned prefectures


-----

deem it impossible to implement measures being introduced based on the Prime Minister’s instructions such
as an instruction for evacuation

**Chapter 2 Items Concerning Assumed Situations in which Japan Comes under Armed Attacks**
Assumed situations in which Japan comes under armed attacks cannot be defined in a uniformed manner. But
such situations can be roughly categorized into four types. These situations are likely to occur in a compound
manner. Characteristics of each type of situation are explained below.
1) Invasion via landing

-  Prior preparations against the invasion are possible. Advanced evacuation from expected battle areas is

necessary.

-  Generally speaking, areas where civil protection measures are to be implemented are assumed to be

wide.
2) Armed attacks by guerrillas and special forces

-  Activities by these forces cannot be forecast or detected in advance. Damage from attacks by these forces

is assumed to occur in an instantaneous manner.

-  Citizens are to be temporarily evacuated to indoor areas as an immediate step against the attack. Full
fledged evacuation is to follow with safety measures being taken by concerned institutions.
3) Attacks by ballistic missiles

-  Determining the missile’s target area when it was fired is extremely difficult. A missile is to reach its target

quickly after it was fired.

-  It is important to try to localize the missile’s damage area by providing information on the launch in a

speedy manner. Evacuation is to be mainly in indoor areas.
4) Attacks via air

-  Bombing by airplanes makes it difficult for authorities to determine specific targets of the attack, which

underlines the need for authorities to issue instructions for outdoor evacuation in wide areas.

**Chapter 3 Establishment of Implementation Posture**
(1) The state, local governments and designated state-run public institutions are to establish a posture to

implement civil protection measures in an appropriate and expeditious manner, including allocating clerical
works to be assigned to divisions and bureaus of these parties and posting of employees of these parties for
specific works under civil protection plans. The state and local governments are to take measures to foster
human resources, including improving educational and training courses.

Local governments are to improve the system to implement civil protection measures while utilizing

existing systems for disaster prevention. Prefectural governments, in particular, should strive to establish a
posture in which their employees stand by around the clock so that they can respond the moment after the
outbreak of an emergency situation, as well as establishing a disaster-prevention system. Municipalities
should strive to strengthen an employee stand-by system in cooperation with local firefighters’ groups
formed on a permanent basis.
(2) A special task force of the state and task forces of local governments are to promote cooperation in order to

implement civil protection measures in a perfect manner.

The Prime Minister is to set up a special task force in the area concerned, when taking response measures

in the local area is deemed necessary. The local task force is to fully take charge of liaison and coordination
with a special task force created at a concerned prefectural government.


-----

**Chapter 4 Items Concerning Measures for Protecting of Civilians**

**1. Measures Concerning Evacuation of Residents**
(1) A warning relating to the situation of armed attacks, a forecast on armed attacks and areas expected to

come under imminent armed attacks is to be issued in a document written as easily as possible and as
compactly as possible. Such warning is to be notified to residents via public communications networks
such as comprehensive administrative networks and regional satellite communications networks as well
as disaster-prevention wireless radio networks operated by local municipalities. Sirens are to be used in
principle so as to ensure that the warning can reach areas where armed attacks are deemed to be imminent
or armed attacks are deemed as having occurred.

Municipalities are to ensure that the warning has reached all households covered by the municipalities

in cooperation with voluntarily formed disaster-prevention organizations and neighborhood associations.
Special consideration is to be given so that aged people and handicapped people can be informed of the
warning.

As broadcasting operators, designated public institutions are to broadcast the warning so as to convey

the warning’s content to households.
(2) The task force chief is to instruct the governor of a concerned prefecture to take evacuation measures when

evacuation of residents from specified areas is deemed necessary after situations surrounding the emergency
are examined in a comprehensive manner.

When the instruction of evacuation measures becomes necessary beyond a certain prefecture, the task

force chief is to instruct the state to take evacuation measures as the state’s policy after hearing views and
opinions from affected prefectures.
(3) Following are points to be considered in the event of evacuation.

-  In view of the fact that having a large number of residents in big cities evacuate to remote areas quickly

during a short period of time is extremely difficult, governors of prefectures should strive to get information
about available evacuation facilities and designate facilities that can sufficiently accommodate such
residents while the task force chief should basically instruct affected residents to immediately evacuate to
indoor facilities in their neighborhood, before issuing other instructions in response to new developments
later.

-  On the evacuation of people living in isolated islands, the Ministry of Land, Infrastructure and Transport is to

provide necessary support by examining the availability of airplanes to be used in the event of an emergency,
so as to smoothly airlift affected people in response to requests by concerned local governments.

-  On the evacuation of people living in the neighborhood of nuclear power plants, the task force chief is to

instruct adequate evacuation measures in response to developments in the situation.

-  On the evacuation of people living in the neighborhood of SDF facilities and U.S. military facilities, the

state and local governments are to keep close cooperation even during peacetime in order to ensure the use
of evacuation facilities, evacuation routes and means to transport evacuees. The state is also to implement
necessary coordination with local governments so that the governments can take measures to evacuate
local residents in the event of armed attacks.

-  On the evacuation of people living on peninsulas, mountainous areas and in the neighborhood of nuclear

power plants, governors of concerned prefectures, when issuing evacuation instructions, can recommend
the use of self-owned vehicles as transportation means for evacuation after taking into consideration traffic
situations of the regions.

-  In cooperation with local governments, the state is to clarify points to be taken into account by civilians

in the event of evacuation and to disseminate these points to the people, depending upon types of armed


-----

attacks including those by ballistic missiles.

-  It is necessary to avoid guiding people to evacuate leeward in the event of armed attacks by nuclear,

biological and chemical weapons, and it is important to have them put on hats and masks in evacuation to
help reduce the skin’s exposure to the contaminated air as much as possible. When human bodies are seen
to be contaminated by radioactive iodine in the wake of nuclear weapons attacks, affected people are to
be instructed to take agents to neutralize such iodine. When attacks by biological and chemical weapons
are launched, affected people are to be instructed to leave the attacked areas or the sites immediately and
evacuate to indoor rooms that are highly shielded against the air outside.
(4) Governors of prefectures who have received evacuation instructions are to instruct affected people to evacuate

immediately via mayors of municipalities. The governors are then to show major evacuation routes such as
national roads and local roads, and cite available transportation means for evacuation such as railways and
buses, after examining geographical features of each region. Local governments are to keep close contact
with designated public transportation operators to ensure means to transport evacuees.

Mayors of municipalities are to have residents informed of the evacuation instruction, using disaster

prevention wireless radio networks operated by the municipalities and public relations vehicles.

As broadcasting operators, designated public institutions are to broadcast information on the evacuation

instruction in a prompt, accurate and compact manner.
(5) When an instruction of evacuation is issued, mayors of municipalities are to devise evacuation implementation

measures in line with the civil protection plan and evacuation guidelines prepared in advance, and to guide
people to safe places.

In order to adequately evacuate aged people and handicapped people, the mayors are to request those

who run facilities that house such people to implement measures for their smooth evacuation in line with
measures that would be taken in the case of fires and earthquakes.

If response measures by employees of the municipalities and local firefighting agencies alone are deemed

to be insufficient, police officers, Japan Coast Guard officers or SDF officers are to be mobilized to smoothly
evacuate affected people.

**2. Measures Concerning Relief of Evacuees**
(1) Following the receipt of an instruction by the task force chief to give relief to evacuated people, governors of

prefectures are to conduct relief operations that are deemed necessary, including provision of accommodation
facilities, supplies of food stuffs and provision of money to buy daily necessities. The governors are to
conduct these relief operations without receiving a relief instruction by the task force chief, if such operations
are deemed to be necessary immediately. Special considerations are to be given in order to provide adequate
relief to aged people and handicapped people.
(2) Prefectural governments are to establish shelters and manage these facilities in an adequate manner by

ensuring the evacuees’ health in a sound condition and maintain their privacy in the shelters.

Prefectural governments are, even during peacetime, to establish methods to supply and procure food,

water and sleeping gear to be used in the event of armed attacks in line with methods that would be employed
in the case of natural disasters.

The state is to supply pharmaceuticals, food stuffs, daily necessities and fuel, when necessary or in line

with support requests from governors of concerned prefectures. The state is also to ensure ways to supply
such goods in cooperation with concerned industrial organizations. The state is to give special consideration
to ensuring ways to supply food stuffs and daily necessities to people in isolated islands.

If necessary, concerned prefectures are to open emergency medical facilities in cases where a large

number of citizens have sustained injuries as a result of large-scale armed attacks against Japan. The


-----

prefectures are also to set up medical squads and dispatch qualified people to the squads. The Ministry of
Health, Labour and Welfare and other ministries are to secure medical doctors and form their own medial
teams, if necessary. The Ministry of Defense is to dispatch hygiene units to affected areas in response to
requests from governors of concerned prefectures or the head of a special task force.
(3) When a disaster stemming from an armed attack occurs, the state and prefectures will utilize medical supplies

and medical equipment that have been stockpiled so that they could be used in the event of armed attacks by
nuclear, biological and chemical weapons.
(4) On medical activities in the event of armed attacks by nuclear, biological and chemical weapons, the

Prime Minister is to instruct concerned Cabinet ministers to take necessary measures, including dispatch
of emergency medical teams, and provision of medical supplies and medical equipment, in cooperation
with concerned prefectural governments. In the event of attacks by biological weapons, medical services
operators are to take necessary protection measures, including vaccination, to provide medical treatment
to the victims and prevent the spread of the biological agents used in the attacks to other areas. In the
event of attacks by chemical weapons, medical services operators are to take necessary measures, including
neutralizing the contamination of the chemical agents used in the attacks as fast as possible.
(5) On activities to collect information on the safety of citizens and provision of such information to other

parties, consideration is to be given to the protection of personal information and freedom of press.

Heads of local governments are to collect and sort out information on the safety of citizens, including

evacuees and people who have been admitted to the hospital. Other administrative organizations are to help
heads of local governments in collecting information on the safety of citizens.

Upon receiving inquiries on the safety of citizens, the Minister of Internal Affairs and Communications

or heads of local governments are to provide information on such safety unless the inquiries are deemed as
being done for unduly purposes.

Designated administrative agencies, designated public institutions and other relevant organizations are

to try to cooperate with heads of local governments in collecting information on the safety of citizens.

The Minister of Internal Affairs and Communications and heads of local governments are to cooperate

with the Red Cross Society of Japan in collecting and sorting out information on the safety of foreign
nationals.

**3. Response Measures Concerning Disasters Caused by Armed Attacks**
(1) On response measures concerning disasters caused by the armed attacks against Japan, the state is to take

necessary measures on its own while the head of a special task force is, if necessary, to immediately instruct
governors of prefectures to implement these measures after explaining an implementation policy to the
governors.

Governors of prefectures are to request the head of a special task force to take necessary measures,

including dispatches of firefighters, police officers, Maritime Safety Agency officers and SDF units, if
preventing disasters from armed attacks and reducing the damage from such attacks by relevant prefectures
alone are deemed difficult.
(2) If emergency measures to prevent danger of citizens are deemed necessary, governments of concerned

prefectures are to swiftly issue an emergency notice and, if necessary, take measures, including an issuance
of an evacuation instruction and designation of dangerous areas.

As broadcasting operators, designated public institutions are to broadcast information on the emergency

notice swiftly.
(3) Government ministries and agencies having jurisdiction over certain livelihood-related facilities and relevant

prefectures should ensure the obtainment of information on these facilities during peacetime.


-----

Government ministries and agencies having jurisdiction over certain livelihood-related facilities should

maintain contact with the Fire and Disaster Management Agency, the National Police Agency and the
Maritime Safety Agency, and take note of special points to be considered to ensure the safety of each facility
according to the characteristics and features of each.

When taking measures to ensure the safety of certain livelihood-related facilities and their surrounding

areas is deemed necessary, the Prime Minister is to instruct relevant Cabinet ministers to strengthen security
and take other measures including evacuation of citizens living in the areas, based on the government’s basic
response plan.

In the event of armed attacks being launched against Japan, governors of prefectures are to request

public safety commissions of the prefectures to swiftly designate livelihood-related facilities where people
are barred from entry. To be designated off-limit are facilities whose security, if not ensured, would cause
significant damage to the surrounding areas, such as dams, nuclear power plants and stations handling a
large amount of dangerous objects.
(4) Following points need to be considered as ways to ensure the security of nuclear power plants in addition to

taking measures which are usually meant to ensure the safety of a livelihood-related facility.

-  When the leakage of radioactive substances is reported or the leakage of such substances is warned, the

Prime Minister is to immediately set up a special local task force while ensuring safety in the affected area.
In principle, such a special task force is to be headquartered in an off-site area. The task force is to organize
a joint council with the concerned local government to work out measures against disasters stemming from
armed attacks on nuclear power plants. The joint council is to be led by the head of the local task force.

-  In the event of armed attacks, nuclear power plant operators are to immediately take necessary measures to

halt the operation of nuclear power reactors. The Minister of Economy, Trade and Industry is to immediately
order nuclear power plant operators to stop the operation of nuclear reactors located in areas covered by
the warning. If a warning is issued without designating specific areas, the Minister of Economy, Trade and
Industry is to order suspension of operation for nuclear reactors whose suspension is deemed necessary
after the degree of danger and its specific content are examined. Nuclear power plant operators are to stop
the operation of their reactors on their own decision if the situation is emergent. After relevant nuclear
power reactors stop operating, the state and nuclear power plant operators are to take necessary measures
to ensure power supply.
(5) When disasters arise following armed attacks by nuclear, biological and chemical weapons, the Prime

Minister is, based on the basic response plan, to instruct relevant Cabinet ministers to swiftly collect
information, launch operations to rescue victims, promptly identify objects that have caused the disaster,
determine the contaminated area, and implement necessary measures to decontaminate the area and prevent
the spread of the contamination. If the situation is emergent, the Prime Minister is to ask for cooperation
from heads of concerned prefectures.

In response to these instructions by the Prime Minister and his request for cooperation from heads of

concerned prefectures, firefighting agencies, prefectural police authorities, the Maritime Safety Agency and
the SDF are to implement necessary response measures. These response measures are to be implemented
after necessary safety measures are taken, including the use of protection gear by those who are to engage in
actual rescue and other operations. In the event of attacks by biological agents, response measures are to be
taken after protection measures are implemented, including vaccination against the agents.

Information on the disaster is to be disseminated to citizens in order to prevent the citizens from

panicking. In the event of attacks by biological agents, information on vaccination is to be disseminated to
citizens while the Minster of Health, Labour and Welfare is to instruct governors of relevant prefectures to
have citizens vaccinated against the agents, if necessary.


-----

The Governor of a concerned prefecture is to make coordination with governors of other prefectures

and police authorities of concerned prefectures before introducing measures including barring citizens from
entering certain buildings and imposing traffic restrictions.

When water used by citizens is contaminated as a result of attacks by nuclear, biological and chemical

weapons, the Minister of Health, Labour and Welfare or governors of prefectural governments are, if
necessary, to order water-supply parties to take measures, including limiting the water supply.
(6) If firefighting, rescue and fast-aid activities are deemed necessary in response to disasters stemming from

armed attacks against Japan, the Commissioner of the Fire and Disaster Management Agency is to instruct
governors of concerned prefectures or mayors of concerned municipalities to ensure that these activities can
be conducted in an appropriate and expeditious manner.

If citizens are infected with biological agents used as weapons in armed attacks against Japan or they

are feared to be infected with such agents, the Ministry of Health, Labour and Welfare is to designate the
infection from the chemical agent as a designated infection and, if necessary, take measures under the
Infectious Disease Law.

When a large amount of waste, such as rubble and debris, arises as a result of large-scale armed attacks

against Japan, the Ministry of the Environment is to promptly dispose of such waste under exceptional rules
set to govern waste disposal.

When protection of important cultural assets from possible damage following armed attacks is deemed

particularly necessary, the Commissioner of the Cultural Affairs Agency is to order or recommend owners
of the assets to take measures to change the assets’ storage places, and to provide necessary support to the
owners if they ask for such support.

**4.** **Points to be Considered Concerning Measures in General to Protect Civilians**
(1) Telecommunications carriers are to preferentially cater to important telecommunications needs by the state,

local governments and designated public institutions to implement measures for civil protection in the wake
of armed attacks against Japan.
(2) In consultation with designated public institutions that serve as transportation operators, the state and local

governments are to strive to ensure transportation of evacuees and emergency relief goods while taking into
consideration safety issues involved.
(3) In the event of armed attacks, police authorities of prefectural governments are to implement traffic restriction

measures on general vehicles, including their being barred from using certain roads, in order to secure traffic
routes for transporting evacuees and emergency relief goods.
(4) Concerned local governments, in cooperation with relevant organizations, are to try to improve systems

to receive emergency relief goods from the general public and businesses, and to distribute these goods to
people needing them.
(5) The state is to set standards and procedures for issuing Red Cross and other special badges to be used

in emergency. Based on these standards and procedures, heads of designated administrative agencies and
others are to devise necessary guidelines for specifically issuing such badges.

**5. Measures to Stabilize Civil Life**
(1) In order to stabilize civil life, the state and local governments are to take necessary measures, including

helping stabilize prices of daily necessities, imposing moratorium on debt repayments, stabilizing the
currency and monetary system, ensuring to offer school education and maintaining employment.
(2) Local governments are to take necessary measures to ensure that water can be supplied in a stable and

appropriate manner. Designated public institutions are to implement necessary measures to ensure that


-----

electricity and gas can be supplied in a stable and appropriate manner, ensure that civil passengers and cargo
can be transported in an appropriate manner, ensure that telecommunications lines can be kept through such
measures as installing emergency circuit lines and to ensure that mail and correspondence services can be
maintained.
(3) The state, local governments and designated public institutions are to begin quick restoration work for

damaged facilities and equipment under their jurisdiction after ensuring appropriate safety measures
involved in the work.

**6. Measures Concerning Reconstruction after Disasters from Armed Attacks**
The state is to implement necessary measures for prompt restoration of facilities and services while examining
their damage from armed attacks. The Government is to promptly take necessary steps to establish a legal
framework to finance measures being implemented in the restoration work following armed attacks.

**7. Exercise and Stockpiling**
(1) The state and local governments should conduct practical training against armed attacks from foreign

countries and evaluate results of the training. Designated public institutions should independently engage in
training for civil protection while such institutions should encourage citizens to participate in training courses
sponsored by the state or local governments. Training mentioned above is to be conducted in combination
with disaster-prevention drills.
(2) The state, local governments and designated public institutions should ensure to get accurate information

about the amount of goods and materials being stockpiled against natural disasters, their specific kinds and
where these goods are to be supplied in disasters so that these goods and materials can also be used for civil
protection in the event of armed attacks against Japan.

The state should try to secure goods and materials that would become necessary in the event of armed

attacks by nuclear, biological and chemical weapons, such as protective garments to be worn against
chemical weapons, and special medicines to neutralize chemical agents, and also should try to improve the
system to procure these goods and materials.

Local governments should establish a system to enable stockpiled anti-disaster goods and materials to be

utilized in the event of armed attacks against Japan, and also should strive to establish a system to procure
and stockpile goods and materials that would become particularly necessary in the event of such armed
attacks.

**Chapter 5 Responses to Emergency Response Situations**
(1) Measures almost equal to civil protection measures that would be taken in the case of armed attacks against

Japan are to be implemented in the event of terrorist attacks against the country, which are seen as roughly
equal to armed attacks. Therefore, the state of being attacked by terrorists is categorized as a situation
that requires emergency response action, leading the Government to take emergency response protection
measures. Following are situations that require emergency response action by the Government.
1) A situation in which an attack is launched against facilities containing inherently dangerous substances
(destruction of nuclear power plants and explosion of petrochemical complex facilities)
2) A situation in which an attack is launched against facilities accommodating a large number of people
and against public transportation systems (explosion of terminal stations and railways)
3) A situation in which an attack is launched using substances that are capable of injuring and killing a
large number of people (indiscriminate dispersion of anthrax and sarin)
4) A situation in which an attack is launched using transportation systems as a way to destroy targets


-----

(suicidal terrorist attacks using civil airplanes)
(2) When a special headquarters is set up to deal with situations requiring emergency response action, the

state, led by the headquarters, is to do its utmost to implement emergency response protection measures in
cooperation with local governments and designated public institutions.

The Prime Minister is to establish a special task force in a certain local area if setting up such a task

force there is deemed necessary. The local task force is to fully take charge of liaison and coordination with
a prefectural task force.
(3) Emergency response protection measures are to be taken basically in line with basic policies and civil

protection steps stipulated under Chapter 1 to Chapter 4 of the basic guidelines.

The notification of warning and the scope of areas subject to such notification in the case of situations

requiring emergency response measures are to be determined by the task force chief after the degree of the
damage by the attack and the scope of geographical areas impacted by the attack are examined.

**Chapter 6 Procedures for Planning Concerning Civil Protection**
The Civil Protection Plan undertaken by designated administrative institutions and prefectures, and the Civil
Protection Plan undertaken by designated public institutions are to be devised or revised after views and opinions
from wider quarters of society are heard. Designated public institutions are to ensure opportunities for hearing
opinions from those who are engaging in work to devise civil protection plans.

**Reference 31. Highlights of the Civil Protection Plan of the Ministry of Defense**

Civil Protection Plans are prepared by all designated administrative agencies based on provisions including
Article 33, Paragraph 1 of the Civil Protection Law.

**1. Basic Concept**
The SDF shall take measures to protect civilians such as evacuation, relief of residents, and responses to armed
attack situations, to the extent possible without affecting its main duty to repel an armed attack with full force in
an armed attack situation.

**2. Implementation Framework**
a. An intra-ministry coordination system and emergency call posture of personnel shall be developed in
peacetime.
b. In armed attack situations and anticipated situations, the Defense Minister shall instruct necessary responses
with the advice of the Defense Council, to be held as necessary. To that end, the system assisting the Defense
Minister shall be established through augmentation of personnel and others. In addition, units shall be put
on readiness in anticipation of implementing civil protection measures (enhanced service capabilities of
personnel, inspection and maintenance of equipment and supplies, etc.).

**3. Implementation Procedures for Civil Protection Measures**
a. If the Defense Minster is requested by a prefectural governor and recognizes it is unavoidable, or is requested
by the Task Force Chief, the Minister of State for Defense, with the approval of the Prime Minister, orders
a civilian protection dispatch to implement civil protection measures.
b. If the Minster of State for Defense is requested for support by a prefectural governor and recognizes it is
required, the Defense Minister orders defense operations/public security operations to all or part of the
forces to implement civil protection measures.

**Reference 33. Japan-U.S. Joint Declaration on Security: Alliance for the 21st Century**

(Tokyo, April 17, 1996)

1. Today, the Prime Minister and the President celebrated one of the most successful bilateral relationships in
history. The leaders took pride in the profound and positive contribution this relationship has made to world
peace and regional stability and prosperity. The strong Alliance between Japan and the U.S. helped ensure
peace and security in the Asia-Pacific region during the Cold War. Our Alliance continues to underlie the
dynamic economic growth in this region. The two leaders agreed that the future security and prosperity of
both Japan and the U.S. are tied inextricably to the future of the Asia-Pacific region.

The benefits of peace and prosperity that spring from the Alliance are due not only to the commitments

of the two Governments, but also to the contributions of the Japanese and American people who have
shared the burden of securing freedom and democracy. The Prime Minister and the President expressed their
profound gratitude to those who sustain the Alliance, especially those Japanese communities that host U.S.
forces, and those Americans who, far from home, devote themselves to the defense of peace and freedom.
2. For more than a year, the two Governments conducted an intensive review of the evolving political and

security environment of the Asia-Pacific region and of various aspects of the Japan-U.S. security relationship.
On the basis of this review, the Prime Minister and the President reaffirmed their commitment to the profound
common values that guide our national policies: the maintenance of freedom, the pursuit of democracy and
respect for human rights. They agreed that the foundations for our cooperation remain firm, and that this
partnership will remain vital in the twenty-first century.

**The Regional Outlook**
3. Since the end of the Cold War, the possibility of global armed conflict has receded. The last few years
have seen expanded political and security dialogue among countries of the region. Respect for democratic
principles is growing. Prosperity is more widespread than at any other time in history, and we are witnessing
the emergence of an Asia-Pacific community. The Asia-Pacific region has become the most dynamic area of
the globe.

At the same time, instability and uncertainty persist in the region. Tensions continue on the Korean

Peninsula. There are still heavy concentrations of military force, including nuclear arsenals. Unresolved
territorial disputes, potential regional conflicts, and the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction and
their means of delivery all constitute sources of instability.

**The Japan-U.S. Alliance and the Treaty of Mutual Cooperation and Security**
4. The Prime Minister and the President underscored the importance of promoting stability in this region and
dealing with the security challenges facing both countries.

In this regard, the Prime Minister and the President reiterated the significant value of the Alliance

between Japan and the U.S. They reaffirmed that the Japan-U.S. security relationship, based on the Treaty of
Mutual Cooperation and Security between Japan and the United States of America, remains the cornerstone
for achieving common security objectives, and for maintaining a stable and prosperous environment for the
Asia-Pacific region as we enter the twenty-first century.
(a) The Prime Minister confirmed Japan’s fundamental defense policy as articulated in its new National

Defense Program Outline adopted in November 1995, which underscored that the Japanese defense
capabilities should play appropriate roles in the security environment after the Cold War. The Prime
Minister and the President agreed that the most effective framework for the defense of Japan is


-----

close defense cooperation between the two countries. This cooperation is based on a combination
of appropriate defense capabilities for the Self-Defense Forces (SDF) of Japan and the Japan-U.S.
Security Arrangements. The leaders again confirmed that U.S. deterrence under the Treaty of Mutual
Cooperation and Security remains the guarantee for Japan’s security.
(b) The Prime Minister and the President agreed that continued U.S. military presence is also essential for

preserving peace and stability in the Asia-Pacific region. The leaders shared the common recognition
that the Japan-U.S. security relationship forms an essential pillar which supports the positive regional
engagement of the U.S.

The President emphasized the U.S. commitment to the defense of Japan as well as to peace and

stability in the Asia-Pacific region. He noted that there has been some adjustment of U.S. forces in
the Asia-Pacific region since the end of the Cold War. On the basis of a thorough assessment, the
U.S. reaffirmed that meeting its commitments in the prevailing security environment requires the
maintenance of its current force structure of about 100,000 forward deployed military personnel in the
region, including about the current level in Japan.
(c) The Prime Minister welcomed the U.S. determination to remain a stable and steadfast presence in the

region. He reconfirmed that Japan would continue appropriate contributions for the maintenance of
U.S. Forces Japan, such as through the provision of facilities and areas in accordance with the Treaty of
Mutual Cooperation and Security and Host Nation Support. The President expressed U.S. appreciation
for Japan’s contributions, and welcomed the conclusion of the new Special Measures Agreement which
provides financial support for U.S. forces stationed in Japan.

**Bilateral Cooperation under the Japan-U.S. Security Relationship**
5. The Prime Minister and the President, with the objective of enhancing the credibility of this vital security

relationship, agreed to undertake efforts to advance cooperation in the following areas.
(a) Recognizing that close bilateral defense cooperation is a central element of the Japan-U.S. Alliance,

both Governments agreed that continued close consultation is essential. Both Governments will further
enhance the exchange of information and views on the international situation, in particular the AsiaPacific region. At the same time, in response to the changes which may arise in the international security
environment, both Governments will continue to consult closely on defense policies and military
postures, including the U.S. force structure in Japan, which will best meet their requirements.
(b) The Prime Minister and the President agreed to initiate a review of the 1978 Guidelines for Japan-U.S.

Defense Cooperation to build upon the close working relationship already established between Japan
and the U.S.

The two leaders agreed on the necessity to promote bilateral policy coordination, including studies

on bilateral cooperation in dealing with situations that may emerge in the areas surrounding Japan and
which will have an important influence on the peace and security of Japan.
(c) The Prime Minister and the President welcomed the April 15, 1996 signature of the Agreement Between

the Government of Japan and the Government of the United States of America Concerning Reciprocal
Provision of Logistic Support, Supplies and Services Between the SDF of Japan and the Armed Forces
of the United States of America, and expressed their hope that this Agreement will further promote the
bilateral cooperative relationship.
(d) Noting the importance of interoperability in all facets of cooperation between the SDF of Japan and

the U.S. forces, the two Governments will enhance mutual exchange in the areas of technology and
equipment, including bilateral cooperative research and development of equipment such as the fighter
support (F-2).


-----

(e) The two Governments recognized that the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction and their means

of delivery has important implications for their common security. They will work together to prevent
proliferation and will continue to cooperate in the ongoing study on ballistic missile defense.
6. The Prime Minister and the President recognized that the broad support and understanding of the Japanese

people are indispensable for the smooth stationing of U.S. Forces Japan, which is the core element of the
Japan-U.S. Security Arrangements. The two leaders agreed that both governments will make every effort to
deal with various issues related to the presence and status of U.S. forces. They also agreed to make further
efforts to enhance mutual understanding between U.S. forces and local Japanese communities.

In particular, with respect to Okinawa, where U.S. facilities and areas are highly concentrated, the Prime

Minister and the President reconfirmed their determination to carry out steps to consolidate, realign, and
reduce U.S. facilities and areas consistent with the objectives of the Treaty of Mutual Cooperation and
Security. In this respect, the two leaders took satisfaction in the significant progress which has been made so
far through the Special Action Committee on Okinawa (SACO), and welcomed the far-reaching measures
outlined in the SACO Interim Report of April 15, 1996. They expressed their firm commitment to achieve a
successful conclusion of the SACO process by November 1996.

**Regional Cooperation**
7. The Prime Minister and the President agreed that the two Governments will jointly and individually strive

to achieve a more peaceful and stable security environment in the Asia-Pacific region. In this regard, the
two leaders recognized that the engagement of the U.S. in the region, supported by the Japan-U.S. security
relationship, constitutes the foundation for such efforts.

The two leaders stressed the importance of peaceful resolution of problems in the region. They

emphasized that it is extremely important for the stability and prosperity of the region that China play
a positive and constructive role, and, in this context, stressed the interest of both countries in furthering
cooperation with China. Russia’s ongoing process of reform contributes to regional and global stability,
and merits continued encouragement and cooperation. The leaders also stated that full normalization of
Japan-Russia relations based on the Tokyo Declaration is important to peace and stability in the Asia-Pacific
region. They noted also that stability on the Korean Peninsula is vitally important to Japan and the U.S. and
reaffirmed that both countries will continue to make every effort in this regard, in close cooperation with
the Republic of Korea.

The Prime Minister and the President reaffirmed that the two Governments will continue working

jointly and with other countries in the region to further develop multilateral regional security dialogues and
cooperation mechanisms such as the ASEAN Regional Forum (ARF), and eventually, security dialogues
regarding Northeast Asia.

**Global Cooperation**
8. The Prime Minister and the President recognized that the Treaty of Mutual Cooperation and Security is
the core of the Japan-U.S. Alliance, and underlies the mutual confidence that constitutes the foundation for
bilateral cooperation on global issues.

The Prime Minister and the President agreed that the two governments will strengthen their cooperation

in support of the U.N. and other international organizations through activities such as peacekeeping and
humanitarian relief operations.

Both Governments will coordinate their policies and cooperate on issues such as arms control and

disarmament, including acceleration of the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty (CTBT) negotiations and the
prevention of the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction and their means of delivery. The two leaders


-----

agreed that cooperation in the U.N. and APEC, and on issues such as the North Korean nuclear problem, the
Middle East peace process, and the peace implementation process in the former Yugoslavia, helps to build
the kind of world that promotes our shared interests and values.

**Conclusion**
9. In concluding, the Prime Minister and the President agreed that the three pillars of the Japan-U.S.

relationship—security, political, and economic—are based on shared values and interests and rest on the
mutual confidence embodied in the Treaty of Mutual Cooperation and Security. The Prime Minister and
the President reaffirmed their strong determination, on the eve of the twenty-first century, to build on the
successful history of security cooperation and to work hand-in-hand to secure peace and prosperity for
future generations.

**Reference 34. Joint Statement U.S.-Japan Security Consultative Committee**

(Washington, DC, February 19, 2005)

1. United States Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice and Secretary of Defense Donald Rumsfeld hosted
Japan’s Minister for Foreign Affairs Nobutaka Machimura and Minister of State for Defense and DirectorGeneral of the Defense Agency Yoshinori Ohno in a meeting of the Security Consultative Committee (SCC)
in Washington, DC, on February 19, 2005. They addressed security and alliance issues facing the United
States and Japan, as well as other aspects of the relationship.

**Working Together on Challenges Facing the World Today**
2. The Ministers noted the excellent state of cooperative relations between the United States and Japan on a

broad array of security, political, and economic issues. They looked to expand that cooperation, recognizing
that the U.S.-Japan Alliance, with the U.S.-Japan Security Arrangements at its core, continues to play a vital
role in ensuring the security and prosperity of both the United States and Japan, as well as in enhancing
regional and global peace and stability.
3. The Ministers underscored the importance of U.S. and Japanese leadership in providing international

assistance to Afghanistan, Iraq, and the broader Middle East—efforts that are already producing results.
The Ministers lauded the successful cooperation between the United States and Japan with other countries
in extending wide-ranging assistance to those who suffered from the earthquake and the subsequent tsunami
disaster in the Indian Ocean.
4. The Ministers recognized that cooperation and consultation between the United States and Japan have

been pivotal in promoting non-proliferation, particularly through the Proliferation Security Initiative. They
welcomed the success of multinational interdiction exercises hosted by the United States and Japan and by
others.
5. The Ministers expressed their confidence that ballistic missile defense (BMD) enhances our ability to defend

against and deter ballistic missile attacks and dissuade other parties from investing in ballistic missiles.
Taking note of achievements in missile defense cooperation, such as Japan’s decision to introduce ballistic
missile defense systems and its recent announcement on its Three Principles on Arms Export, the Ministers
reaffirmed their commitment to close cooperation on policy and operational matters and to advancing U.S.Japan cooperative research in BMD systems, with a view to possible cooperative development.


-----

**Common Strategic Objectives**
6. The Ministers discussed the new security environment in which new and emerging threats, such as

international terrorism and proliferation of weapons of mass destruction (WMD) and their means of delivery,
have surfaced as common challenges. They recognized that deepening interdependence among nations in a
global community means that such threats can affect the security of nations worldwide, including the United
States and Japan.
7. While noting that these threats are also emerging in the Asia-Pacific region, the Ministers also emphasized

that persistent challenges continue to create unpredictability and uncertainty. Moreover, they noted that
modernization of military capabilities in the region also requires attention.
8. The Ministers strongly urged North Korea to return to the Six-Party Talks expeditiously and without

preconditions, and to commit itself to complete dismantlement of all its nuclear programs in a transparent
manner subject to verification.
9. Based on this understanding of the international security environment, the Ministers concurred that both

Governments need to work closely together to pursue common strategic objectives through their respective
efforts, implementation of the U.S.-Japan Security Arrangements, and other joint efforts based on the
Alliance. Both sides decided to hold regular consultations to coordinate policies in accordance with these
common strategic objectives and to update these objectives as the security environment requires.
10. In the region, common strategic objectives include:

-  Ensure the security of Japan, strengthen peace and stability in the Asia-Pacific region, and maintain the

capability to address contingencies affecting the United States and Japan.

11. Global common strategic objectives include:

-  Promote fundamental values such as basic human rights, democracy, and the rule of law in the international

community.

-  Further consolidate U.S.-Japan partnership in international peace cooperation activities and development

assistance to promote peace, stability, and prosperity worldwide.

-  Promote the reduction and non-proliferation of weapons of mass destruction (WMD) and their means of

delivery, including through improved reliability and effectiveness of the Non-Proliferation Treaty, the
International Atomic Energy Agency, and other regimes, and initiatives such as the Proliferation Security
Initiative.

-  Prevent and eradicate terrorism.


-----

-  Coordinate efforts to improve the effectiveness of the United Nations Security Council by making the best

use of the current momentum to realize Japan’s aspiration to become a permanent member.

-  Maintain and enhance the stability of the global energy supply.

**Strengthening of U.S.-Japan Security and Defense Cooperation**
12. The Ministers expressed their support and appreciation for each other’s efforts to develop their respective

security and defense policies. Japan’s new National Defense Program Guidelines (NDPG) emphasize Japan’s
capability to respond effectively to new threats and diverse contingencies, Japan’s active engagement to
improve the international security environment, and the importance of the Japan-U.S. Alliance. As a central
component of its broad defense transformation effort, the United States is reorienting and strengthening its
global defense posture to provide it with appropriate, strategy-driven capabilities in an uncertain security
environment. The Ministers confirmed that these efforts will ensure and strengthen effective security and
defense cooperation as both countries pursue common strategic objectives.
13. In this context, the Ministers underscored the need to continue examining the roles, missions, and capabilities

of Japan’s Self-Defense Forces and the U.S. Armed Forces required to respond effectively to diverse
challenges in a well-coordinated manner. This examination will take into account recent achievements and
developments such as Japan’s NDPG and new legislation to deal with contingencies, as well as the expanded
agreement on mutual logistical support and progress in BMD cooperation. The Ministers also emphasized
the importance of enhancing interoperability between U.S. and Japanese forces.
14. The Ministers concurred that this examination should contribute to these consultations on realignment of

U.S. force structure in Japan. They decided to intensify these consultations in a comprehensive effort to
strengthen the Alliance as the bedrock of Japan’s security and the anchor of regional stability. In this context,
both sides confirmed their commitment to maintaining deterrence and capabilities of U.S. forces in Japan
while reducing the burden on local communities, including those in Okinawa. The Ministers directed their
staffs to report expeditiously on the results of these consultations.
15. The Ministers also stressed the importance of continued efforts to enhance positive relations between local

communities and U.S. forces. They emphasized that improved implementation of the Status of Forces
Agreement (SOFA), including due attention to the environment, and steady implementation of the Special
Action Committee on Okinawa (SACO) Final Report are important to the stable presence of U.S. forces in
Japan.
16. The Ministers, noting that the current Special Measures Agreement (SMA) will expire in March 2006,

decided to start consultations on future arrangements to provide appropriate levels of host nation support,
bearing in mind the significant role of the SMA in supporting the presence of U.S. forces in Japan.

**Reference 35. U.S.-Japan Alliance: Transformation and Realignment for the Future**

 (Washington, DC, October 29, 2005)

**I. Overview**
The U.S.-Japan Alliance, with the U.S.-Japan Security Arrangements at its core, is the indispensable foundation
of Japan’s security and of peace and stability in the Asia-Pacific region. A close, cooperative relationship based
on the Alliance also plays an important role in effectively dealing with global challenges, and must evolve to
reflect the changing security environment. Therefore, following the December 2002 meeting of the Security
Consultative Committee (SCC), the U.S. and Japan intensified consultations on respective U.S. and Japanese


-----

security and defense policies in order to examine the direction of the U.S.-Japan Alliance, and to develop options
to adapt the Alliance to the changing regional and global security environment.

At the February 19, 2005 meeting of the SCC, the Ministers reached an understanding on common strategic

objectives, and underscored the need to continue examinations of the roles, missions, and capabilities of Japan’s
Self-Defense Forces (SDF) and the U.S. Armed Forces in pursuing those objectives. They also decided to
intensify their consultations on realignment of U.S. force structure in Japan and directed their staffs to report
expeditiously on the results.

Today, the SCC members reaffirmed their shared view of the security environment, in which new and emerging

threats have surfaced as common challenges that can affect the security of nations worldwide, including the U.S.
and Japan. They also reemphasized the persistent challenges in the Asia-Pacific region that create unpredictability
and uncertainty and underscored the need to pay attention to modernization of military capabilities in the region.
In this context, both sides reiterated their commitment to work closely together to pursue the regional and global
common strategic objectives identified in their February 19, 2005 Joint Statement.

The SCC members approved findings and recommendations on roles, missions, and capabilities. They also

approved recommendations for realignment, as reflected in this report. These measures are designed to enhance
the Alliance’s capability to meet new threats and diverse contingencies and, as a whole, will reduce burdens
on local communities, thereby strengthening security and ensuring the Alliance remains the anchor of regional
stability.

**II. Roles, Missions, and Capabilities**
Both sides recognized recent achievements and developments in security and defense policies related to the roles,
missions, and capabilities of the U.S. and Japan, to include: bilateral cooperation in international activities such
as the fight against terrorism, the Proliferation Security Initiative (PSI), assistance to Iraq, and disaster relief
following the tsunami in the Indian Ocean and the earthquake in South Asia; Japan’s December 2004 National
Defense Program Guidelines; progress in ballistic missile defense (BMD) cooperation; Japan’s legislation to deal
with contingencies; the SDF’s planned transition to a new joint operations posture; and the transformation and
global posture realignment of U.S. forces.
1. Primary Areas

In this context, the U.S. and Japan examined bilateral roles, missions, and capabilities, particularly those of the
U.S. forces and the SDF, for responding to diverse challenges in the contemporary security environment, placing
primary emphasis on the following two areas:

— Defense of Japan and responses to situations in areas surrounding Japan, including responses to new

threats and diverse contingencies;

— Efforts to improve the international security environment, such as participation in international peace

cooperation activities.
2. Basic Concepts of Roles, Missions, and Capabilities

Both sides confirmed several basic concepts relevant to bilateral defense cooperation. Related to defense of Japan
and responses to situations in areas surrounding Japan, these concepts include:

l Bilateral defense cooperation remains vital to the security of Japan as well as to peace and stability of the

region.

l Japan will defend itself and respond to situations in areas surrounding Japan, including addressing new threats

and diverse contingencies such as ballistic missile attacks, attacks by guerilla and special forces, and invasion
of remote islands. For these purposes, Japan’s defense posture will be strengthened in accordance with the
2004 National Defense Program Guidelines.

l The U.S. will maintain forward-deployed forces, and augment them as needed, for the defense of Japan as


-----

well as to deter and respond to situations in areas surrounding Japan. The U.S. will provide all necessary
support for the defense of Japan.

l U.S. and Japanese operations in the defense of Japan and responses to situations in areas surrounding Japan

must be consistent so that appropriate responses will be ensured when a situation in areas surrounding Japan
threatens to develop into an armed attack against Japan or when such a situation and an armed attack against
Japan occur simultaneously.

l Japan will continue to provide host nation support including facilities and areas for U.S. forces (hereafter

referred to as “U.S. facilities and areas”). Japan will also take appropriate measures to provide seamless
support to U.S. operations as the situation evolves, including support based on Japan’s legislation to deal with
contingencies. Both sides will work with local communities to ensure stable support for the presence and
operations of U.S. forces in Japan.

l U.S. strike capabilities and the nuclear deterrence provided by the U.S. remain an essential complement

to Japan’s defense capabilities in ensuring the defense of Japan and contribute to peace and security in the
region. Both sides also confirmed several basic concepts relevant to roles, missions, and capabilities in the
area of improving the international security environment, to include:

l Bilateral cooperation in improving the international security environment to achieve regional and global

common strategic objectives has become an important element of the alliance. To this end, the U.S. and Japan
contribute as appropriate based on their respective capabilities, and take necessary measures to establish
effective posture.

l Rapid and effective response requires flexible capabilities and can benefit from close U.S.-Japan bilateral

cooperation and policy coordination. Regular exercises, including those with third countries, can improve
these capabilities.

l The U.S. forces and the SDF will strengthen cooperation with other partners to contribute to international

activities to improve the international security environment. In addition, both sides emphasized that the
increasing importance of addressing new threats and diverse contingencies and improving the international
security environment compels both sides to develop their respective defense capabilities, and to maximize the
benefits of innovations in technology.
3. Examples of Operations in Bilateral Security and Defense Cooperation to be Improved
Both sides reconfirmed that the entire spectrum of bilateral cooperation must be strengthened, consistent with
relevant national security policies and laws, and with agreements between the U.S. and Japan. Through their
examination of roles, missions, and capabilities, they emphasized the importance of improving several specific
areas of cooperation:

l Air defense.
l Ballistic missile defense.
l Counter-proliferation operations, such as the Proliferation Security Initiative (PSI).
l Counter-terrorism.
l Minesweeping, maritime interdiction, and other operations to maintain the security of maritime traffic.
l Search and rescue operations.
l Intelligence, surveillance and reconnaissance (ISR) operations, including increasing capabilities and

effectiveness of operations by unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV) and maritime patrol aircraft.

l Humanitarian relief operations.
l Reconstruction assistance operations.
l Peacekeeping operations and capacity building for other nations’ peacekeeping efforts.
l Protection of critical infrastructure, including U.S. facilities and areas in Japan.
l Response to attacks by weapons of mass destruction (WMD), including disposal and decontamination of


-----

WMD.

l Mutual logistics support activities such as supply, maintenance, and transportation. Supply cooperation

includes mutual provision of aerial and maritime refueling. Transportation cooperation includes expanding
and sharing airlift and sealift, including the capability provided by high speed vessels (HSV).

l Transportation, use of facilities, medical support, and other related activities for non-combatant evacuation

operations (NEO).

l Use of seaport and airport facilities, road, water space and airspace, and frequency bands.

Both sides emphasized that other areas of operations not explicitly listed above remain important to alliance
capabilities; this list highlights key areas for further enhancement but is not intended to be an exhaustive list
of possible areas of cooperation.
4. Essential Steps to Strengthen Posture for Bilateral Security and Defense Cooperation

Based on the examination of roles, missions, and capabilities described above, both sides further identified the
following essential steps that can be taken in peacetime to strengthen the posture of bilateral security and defense
cooperation to deal with diverse challenges in the new security environment. Both sides also emphasized the
importance of continuing examinations of roles, missions, and capabilities, based on the progress made thus far,
to ensure effective bilateral cooperation.

l Close and Continuous Policy and Operational Coordination.

Both sides recognized that regular policy and operational coordination will improve the alliance’s timely and
effective response to future changes in the strategic environment and to contingencies. Close and continuous
policy and operational coordination at every level of government, from unit tactical level through strategic
consultations, is essential to dissuade destabilizing military build-ups, to deter aggression, and to respond to
diverse security challenges. Development of a common operational picture shared between U.S. forces and
the SDF will strengthen operational coordination and should be pursued where possible. Closer cooperation
between defense and other pertinent authorities is also increasingly necessary. In this context, both sides
reaffirmed the need to improve the effectiveness of the comprehensive mechanism and bilateral coordination
mechanism under the 1997 Guidelines for U.S.-Japan Defense Cooperation by streamlining their functions.

l Advancing Bilateral Contingency Planning.

Recalling that the 1997 Guidelines for U.S.-Japan Defense Cooperation provide a basis for bilateral defense
planning and mutual cooperation planning, both sides affirmed the continual requirement for such planning
while taking full account of the changing security environment. This planning will reflect Japan’s legislation
to deal with contingencies, which provides a strengthened basis for contingency use by U.S. forces and the
SDF of facilities, including airports and seaports, in Japan. Both sides will expand their planning by adding
specificity, coordinating closely with relevant government agencies and local authorities, enhancing bilateral
mechanisms and planning methods, conducting detailed surveys of civilian and SDF air and seaports, and
validating their planning work through strengthened bilateral exercise programs.

l Enhancing Information Sharing and Intelligence Cooperation.

Recognizing that common situational awareness is a key to well coordinated cooperation, both sides will
enhance information sharing and intelligence cooperation in the whole range from unit tactical level through
national strategic level. To facilitate this interaction, both sides will take additional necessary measures
to protect shared classified information so that broader information sharing is promoted among pertinent
authorities.

l Improving Interoperability.

To ensure smooth cooperation as the SDF transitions to a joint operations posture, U.S. forces and the SDF
will maintain regular consultations to maintain and strengthen interoperability. Continued cooperation in
planning for bilateral operations and exercises will strengthen connectivity between the headquarters of U.S.


-----

forces and the SDF and will benefit from improved secure communications capabilities.

l Expanding Training Opportunities in Japan and the United States.

Both sides will expand opportunities for bilateral training and exercises to improve interoperability, improve
capabilities, enhance readiness, more equitably distribute training impacts among local communities, and
advance the effectiveness of bilateral operations. These measures will include increasing mutual use of U.S.
and SDF training facilities and areas throughout Japan. The training of SDF personnel and units in Guam,
Alaska, Hawaii, and the U.S. mainland will also be expanded.

❍ In particular, the U.S. plans to expand its training infrastructure in Guam will provide increased training

opportunities for the SDF in Guam.

❍ Additionally, both sides recognized that U.S. forces and SDF participation in multinational training and

exercises will enhance their contribution to a better international security environment.

l Shared Use of Facilities by U.S. Forces and the SDF.

Both sides recognized that shared-use of facilities between U.S. forces and the SDF contributes to closer
bilateral operational coordination and improved interoperability. Specific opportunities for shared use of
facilities are described in the force posture realignment recommendations (see section below).

l Ballistic Missile Defense (BMD).

Emphasizing that BMD plays a critical role in deterring and defending against ballistic missile attacks, and can
dissuade other parties from development and proliferation of ballistic missiles, both sides stressed the value of
closely coordinating improvements in their respective BMD capabilities. To support these BMD systems, they
emphasized the critical importance of constant information gathering and sharing, as well as maintaining high
readiness and interoperability in light of the minimal time available to respond to a ballistic missile threat. The
U.S. will deploy additional complementary capabilities in and around Japan when appropriate, coordinating
their operations to support Japan’s missile defense operations. Close coordination between respective BMD
command and control systems will be critical to effective missile defense operations.
Both sides committed to strengthen and improve the effectiveness of bilateral cooperation under the 1997
Guidelines for U.S.-Japan Defense Cooperation and, as appropriate, in additional areas not currently addressed
by the Guidelines.

**III. Force Posture Realignment**
Both sides reviewed the posture of U.S. forces in Japan and related SDF forces, in light of their shared
commitment to maintain deterrence and capabilities while reducing burdens on local communities, including
those in Okinawa. Both sides recognized the importance of enhancing Japanese and U.S. public support for the
security alliance, which contributes to sustainable presence of U.S. forces at facilities and areas in Japan.

1. Guiding Precepts

In their review, taking full account of the examination of bilateral roles, missions, and capabilities, both sides
established several precepts to guide force posture realignments in Japan.

l The U.S. military presence in the Asia-Pacific region is a core capability that is indispensable to regional

peace and security and critical to both the U.S. and Japan. Japan contributes capabilities that are additional
and complementary to those provided by the U.S. forces, while taking the leading role of providing for its own
defense. The presence of U.S. forces and the SDF must evolve as the regional and global security environment
changes and as both sides assess alliance roles and missions.

l Capabilities will be strengthened through realignment as well as adjustment of roles, missions, and capabilities;

these capabilities underpin the credibility of U.S. commitments to the defense of Japan and peace and security
of the region.


-----

l Enhanced coordination and improved interoperability between headquarters for flexible and responsive

command and control is a core capability of critical importance to the U.S. and Japan. In that context, both
sides recognized the continued importance of Headquarters, U.S. Forces Japan for strengthened bilateral
coordination.

l Regular training and exercises, as well as availability of facilities and areas for these purposes, are essential

to ensure readiness, employability, and interoperability of forces. When consistent with military missions and
operational requirements, dispersal of training can provide greater diversity of training opportunities and can
have the ancillary benefit of reducing burdens of training on local communities.

l Shared military use of both U.S. and SDF facilities and areas is valuable in promoting effectiveness of bilateral

cooperation and increasing efficiencies.

l Adequate capacity of U.S. facilities and areas is necessary, and the capacity above typical daily peacetime

usage levels also plays a critical and strategic role in meeting contingency requirements. This capacity can
provide an indispensable and critical capability toward meeting local emergency needs such as in disaster
relief and consequence management situations.

l Particular attention will be paid to possible realignment of force structure in such regions where U.S. facilities

and areas are concentrated in densely populated areas.

l Opportunities to introduce civil-military dual-use of U.S. facilities and areas will be studied, where appropriate.

Implementation of such dual-use must be compatible with military missions and operational requirements.
2. Recommendations for Realignment
Based upon intensive consultations conducted thus far and in keeping with these basic precepts, domestic and
bilateral coordination should be conducted for the following initiatives in a timely manner, consistent with the
U.S.-Japan Security Treaty and its related arrangements. The Ministers committed themselves to completing
local coordination, and directed their staffs to finalize these specific and interrelated initiatives and develop plans,
including concrete implementation schedules no later than March 2006. These initiatives represent elements of
a coherent package, which will begin to be implemented upon agreement on the overall package. Both sides
emphasized the importance of taking necessary measures required for the prompt implementation of these
initiatives.

l Strengthening Bilateral and Joint Operational Coordination.

Recognizing the Government of Japan’s intention to transform the SDF into a joint operations posture, the
Headquarters, U.S. Forces Japan will establish a bilateral and joint operations coordination center at Yokota
Air Base. The shared use of this center will ensure constant connectivity, coordination, and interoperability
among U.S. forces in Japan and the SDF.

l Improvement of U.S. Army Command and Control Capability.

The capabilities of the U.S. Army Japan’s command structure in Camp Zama will be modernized to a
deployable, joint task force-capable operational headquarters element. The transformed command structure
will provide an additional capability to respond rapidly for the defense of Japan and other contingencies.
Adjustments to U.S. facilities and areas will be made to accommodate the new Army command structure and
integral capabilities. The establishment of the headquarters of a GSDF Central Readiness Force Command,
which will operate units for nationwide mobile operations and special tasks, will be pursued at Camp Zama,
thereby strengthening the coordination between the headquarters. In relation to this realignment, possibilities
of more effective and efficient use of Camp Zama and Sagami General Depot will be explored.

l Collocation of Air Command and Control.

Japan’s Air Defense Command and relevant units, currently located at Fuchu, will be collocated with the
headquarters of the U.S. 5th Air Force at Yokota Air Base, strengthening the coordination between air and
missile defense command and control elements, and sharing relevant sensor data through the bilateral and


-----

joint operations coordination center described above.
Yokota Air Base and Airspace.
Measures to facilitate movement of civilian aircraft through Yokota airspace will be explored, bearing in mind
the planned expansion of nearby Haneda Airport in 2009. Possible options to study will include reducing the
airspace under U.S. control and collocation of Japanese air traffic controllers at Yokota Air Base. In addition,
both sides will take into account development of the process of transferring the Kadena radar approach control.
The specific conditions and modalities for possible civil-military dual-use will be studied, while noting that
dual-use must not compromise the military operational capabilities of Yokota Air Base.
Missile Defense.
The optimum site for deployment in Japan of a new U.S. X-Band radar system will be examined. Through
timely information sharing, this radar will support capabilities to intercept missiles directed at Japan and
capabilities for Japan’s civil defense and consequence management. In addition, as appropriate, the U.S.
will deploy active defenses, such as Patriot PAC-3 and Standard Missile (SM-3) to support U.S. treaty
commitments.
Regional Realignment of U.S. Marine Forces for Flexible Crisis Response.
As part of its global posture realignment effort, the U.S. is making several changes to strengthen its force
structure in the Pacific. Among these changes are a strengthening of Marine Corps crisis response capabilities
and a redistribution of those capabilities among Hawaii, Guam and Okinawa that will provide greater
flexibility to respond with appropriate capabilities according to the nature and location of particular situations.
These changes will also enable increased theater security cooperation with countries of the region, thereby
improving the overall security environment. In connection with this realignment, both sides identified an
integrated set of interrelated measures that will also substantially reduce burdens in Okinawa.

❍ Acceleration of Futenma Relocation: Both sides, bearing in mind the strong request from residents of

Okinawa for early return of Marine Corps Air Station (MCAS) Futenma, as well as the preference that
any Futenma replacement facility (FRF) be located outside of Okinawa Prefecture, considered options to
satisfy these requests while maintaining the deterrence capabilities that will remain necessary in the future.
They determined that the rapid crisis response capabilities provided by the presence of Marine Corps
forces constitute a critical alliance capability that both sides desire to maintain in the region. Moreover,
they recognized that sustaining those capabilities, which consist of air, ground, logistics and command
elements, remains dependent upon the interaction of those elements in regular training, exercises and
operations. For this reason, both sides concluded that the FRF must be located within Okinawa Prefecture
where rotary wing aircraft currently stationed at Futenma Air Station will be near the other elements with
which they operate on a regular basis.

❍ Both sides, recognizing the extensive delays in Futenma relocation resulting from the many problems

related to the 1996 Special Action Committee on Okinawa (SACO) plan for relocation of Futenma Air
Station to a civil-military facility located on a coral reef in deep waters, examined numerous other possible
options for relocation within Okinawa Prefecture that could accelerate return of Futenma Air Station while
maintaining operational capabilities. Both sides considered several factors in this work, including:

-  Safety of neighboring communities and military personnel.

-  Noise impacts on local communities, taking into account future housing and commercial development

patterns that might occur in the vicinity of the FRF.

-  Minimization of adverse environmental impacts.

-  Ability of the FRF to support operational and mission requirements in peacetime and in contingencies.

-  Inclusion of necessary operational support, billeting and related facilities in the FRF, to avoid creation

of traffic congestion and related irritants that might otherwise detract from the quality of life of local


-----

residents.

Bearing such factors in mind, both sides will locate the FRF in an “L”-shaped configuration that combines
the shoreline areas of Camp Schwab and adjacent water areas of Oura Bay. The runway portion of the
facility will cross Henoko-saki, extending from Oura Bay into the water areas along the south shore of
Camp Schwab. The lower section of the facility, oriented in a northeast-southwest direction will include
a runway and overruns, with a total length of 1,800 meters exclusive of seawalls. Hangars, maintenance,
fuel supply pier and related infrastructure, and other aviation support activities required for the operation
of the new facility will be located on the areas of the FRF to be constructed within Oura Bay. Furthermore,
facilities in the Camp Schwab area will be reconfigured as necessary to accommodate the relocation of
Futenma-related activities. (Reference: Initialed concept plan dated 26 October 2005.)
Both sides concurred that other capabilities now present at Futenma Air Station would be relocated and
maintained as provided for in the SACO Final Report, with the following adjustments:

-  With regards to the KC-130s, which are to be relocated from Futenma Air Station to Iwakuni Air Station

under the SACO Final Report, alternative facilities will be considered with priority consideration given
to MSDF Kanoya Base. The final basing configuration will be determined by both sides based on ongoing
operational and engineering studies.

-  Strengthened contingency use of the ASDF bases at Nyutabaru and Tsuiki will be provided for U.S.

forces. Improvements to operational facilities at these bases will be made to support this contingency use.
These improved facilities, when completed, will also support the expanded bilateral training activities
described in the Roles, Missions and Capabilities section of this report.

-  Improved contingency use of civilian facilities for long runway operations that cannot be replicated at the

FRF will also be provided for U.S. forces.

Both sides recognized that early realization of the foregoing measures, in addition to enabling the longdesired return of Futenma Air Station, is an essential component of the realignment of the Marine Corps
presence in Okinawa.
Force Reductions: In conjunction with the realignment of U.S. Marine Corps capabilities in the Pacific
region outlined above, the headquarters of the III Marine Expeditionary Force (III MEF) will be relocated
to Guam and other locations and the remaining Marine units in Okinawa will be realigned and reduced
into a Marine Expeditionary Brigade (MEB). This realignment in Okinawa will include the transfer of
approximately 7,000 Marine officers and enlisted personnel, plus dependents out of Okinawa. These
transferred personnel will come from units in each of the elements of Marine capability (air, ground,
logistics and command), including portions of the Marine Air Wing, the Force Service Support Group, and
the 3rd Marine Division.
The Government of Japan, recognizing the strong desire of Okinawa residents that such force relocations
be realized rapidly, will work with the U.S. Government to examine and identify appropriate financial and
other measures to enable the realization of these relocations to Guam.
Land Returns and Shared-Use of Facilities: Recognizing that successful relocation of Futenma Air Station
and the force reductions described above will make further consolidation of forces and return of land
possible, both sides discussed the concept of consolidation of those Marine Corps units that remain in
Okinawa into a smaller total land area. This would enable the return of significant land in the densely
populated areas south of Kadena Air Base. The U.S. stressed its willingness to develop and implement a
concrete program for this concept in cooperation with the Government of Japan.
Furthermore, recognizing the limited access that the SDF have to facilities in Okinawa, most of which are
located in urbanized areas, the U.S. also underscored its willingness to implement shared-use of Kadena Air
Base, Camp Hansen, and other U.S. facilities and areas in Okinawa in cooperation with the Government


-----

of Japan. Both sides consider that such shared use could facilitate bilateral training and interoperability
between their forces, as described in the Roles, Missions and Capabilities section of this report, and thereby
strengthen overall alliance capabilities.

❍ Steady Implementation of SACO Final Report: Both sides validated the importance of steady

implementation of the recommendations of the Special Action Committee on Okinawa (SACO) Final
Report unless otherwise changed by the recommendations in this document.

Relocation of Carrier Air Wing from Atsugi Air Facility to Iwakuni Air Station.
To ensure the viability of a long-term forward-deployment of the U.S. aircraft carrier and its air wing, the
carrier jet and E-2C squadrons will be relocated from Atsugi Air Facility to Iwakuni Air Station, which will
have the necessary facilities and training airspace for safe and effective operation of the aircraft in a less
intrusive manner after the current construction of the replacement runway is completed. To alleviate the
impact of the increased operations at Iwakuni Air Station, the following related measures will be taken.

❍ Relocation of MSDF E/O/UP-3 squadrons and other aircraft from Iwakuni Air Station to Atsugi Air

Facility.

❍ Adjustment of training airspace for all U.S. Navy and U.S. Marine Corps aircraft to ensure adequate

readiness levels are maintained.

❍ Identification of a permanent field-carrier landing practice (FCLP) facility. In the interim, the U.S.

will continue to conduct FCLPs at Iwo Jima in accordance with existing temporary arrangements. The
Government of Japan reiterates its commitment to provide an acceptable permanent FCLP facility for U.S.
naval aviation forces.

❍ Development of necessary facilities at the MSDF Kanoya Base to accommodate KC-130 aircraft. These

facilities will also be available to support rotations of additional SDF or U.S. C-130 or P-3 aircraft from
elsewhere in Japan to increase Alliance capabilities and flexibility.

❍ Development of necessary additional facilities, infrastructure, and training areas required to support U.S.

Navy and U.S. Marine Corps units based at Iwakuni Air Station, as well as civil aviation operations.

Training Relocation.
Consistent with the necessity of improving bilateral interoperability discussed in this report, and with
reference to the goal of reducing the impact of training activity, renewed attention will be given to expanding
the distribution of training from U.S. air facilities such as Kadena Air Base as well as Misawa Air Base and
Iwakuni Air Station to other military facilities.
Efficient Use of Capacity at U.S. Facilities in Japan.
Opportunities to strengthen U.S. cooperation with the Government of Japan and local communities regarding
efficient use of capacity at U.S. facilities in Japan will be pursued when consistent with operational requirements
and safety. For example, both sides will explore possibilities for utilizing the capacity of Sagami General
Depot for meeting local emergency needs such as in disaster relief and civilian consequence management.

Future changes in U.S. facilities and areas and force structure not addressed elsewhere in this report

will be addressed in accordance with existing practices under the U.S.-Japan Security Treaty and its related
arrangements.

**Reference 36. United States-Japan Security Consultative Committee Document Joint**

**Statement**

(Washington, DC, May 1, 2006)

The U.S.-Japan Alliance, with the U.S.-Japan security relationship at its core, is the indispensable foundation
of Japan’s security and of peace and stability in the Asia-Pacific region and the linchpin of American security
policy in the region. This strong partnership is increasingly vital in meeting global challenges, and in promoting
fundamental values shared by both nations, including basic human rights, freedom, democracy, and the rule of
law. The alliance has successfully adapted itself to changes in the regional and global security environment,
and it must continue to evolve in depth and scope in order to address future challenges. To remain strong, this
partnership must be reinforced by continued firm public support in both countries.

At today’s meeting, the Ministers, sharing the view that new and emerging threats pose a common challenge

that affects the security of nations worldwide, noted the increasingly close cooperation between their two
countries on a broad array of issues. The Ministers confirmed their desire to expand that cooperation to ensure
the U.S.-Japan Alliance continues to play a vital role in enhancing regional and global peace and security. The
Ministers noted the importance of U.S. and Japanese efforts to strengthen democracy in and reconstruct Iraq and
Afghanistan, and to support reform efforts in the broader Middle East. They committed to work closely on efforts
to convince Iran to suspend all enrichment-related activities and cooperate fully with the International Atomic
Energy Agency’s investigation, and agreed on the need for concerted United Nations Security Council action.

As elsewhere in the world, the Asia-Pacific region faces persistent challenges that give rise to unpredictability

and uncertainty. The Ministers reconfirmed a shared commitment to the Joint Statement of the Six-Party Talks, and
urged North Korea to return expeditiously to the talks without preconditions, to dismantle its nuclear programs in
a complete, verifiable and irreversible manner, and to cease all illicit and proliferation activities. They reaffirmed
the importance of resolving regional disputes through diplomatic efforts, and called for greater transparency on
the modernization of military capabilities in the region.

In this security environment, the Ministers affirmed their commitment to close cooperation in realizing

the common strategic objectives the Security Consultative Committee (SCC) identified in February 2005.
The Ministers stressed the imperative of strengthening and improving the effectiveness of bilateral security
and defense cooperation in such areas as ballistic missile defense, bilateral contingency planning, information
sharing and intelligence cooperation, and international peace cooperation activities, as well as the importance of
improving interoperability of Japan’s Self-Defense Forces and U.S. forces, as outlined in the recommendations
on bilateral roles, missions, and capabilities described in the October 2005 SCC document. In this context, the
Ministers emphasized the importance of examining the scope of security and defense cooperation to ensure
a robust alliance relationship, and to enhance the alliance’s capability to respond to diverse challenges in the
evolving regional and global security environment.

At the SCC meeting held today, the Ministers approved implementation details for the October 2005

realignment initiatives, which are described in today’s SCC document, “United States-Japan Roadmap for
Realignment Implementation.” The Ministers recognized that the implementation of these realignment initiatives
will lead to a new phase in alliance cooperation and strengthened alliance capabilities in the region. The measures
to be implemented demonstrate the resolve of both parties to strengthen their commitments under the U.S.-Japan
Security Treaty and, at the same time, to reduce the burden on local communities, including those on Okinawa,
thereby providing the basis for enhanced public support for the security alliance. Recognizing the Government of
Japan’s coordination with local communities, the Ministers confirmed the feasibility of the realignment initiatives.
Recognizing also that completion of these realignment initiatives is essential to strengthen the foundation of


-----

alliance transformation, the Ministers committed themselves to the timely and thorough implementation of the
plan, consistent with the U.S.-Japan Security Treaty and its related arrangements.

**Reference 37. United States-Japan Roadmap for Realignment Implementation**

(Washington, DC, May 1, 2006)

**Overview**
On October 29, 2005, the U.S.-Japan Security Consultative Committee (SCC) members approved recommendations
for realignment of U.S. forces in Japan and related Japan Self-Defense Forces (SDF) in their document, “U.S.Japan Alliance: Transformation and Realignment for the Future.” In that document, the SCC members directed
their respective staffs “to finalize these specific and interrelated initiatives and develop plans, including concrete
implementation schedules no later than March 2006.” This work has been completed and is reflected in this
document.

**Finalization of Realignment Initiatives**
The individual realignment initiatives form a coherent package. When implemented, these realignments will
ensure a life-of-the-alliance presence for U.S. forces in Japan.

The construction and other costs for facility development in the implementation of these initiatives will be

borne by the Government of Japan (GOJ) unless otherwise specified. The U.S. Government (USG) will bear
the operational costs that arise from implementation of these initiatives. The two Governments will finance
their realignment-associated costs consistent with their commitments in the October 29, 2005 SCC document to
maintain deterrence and capabilities while reducing burdens on local communities.

**Key Implementation Details**
1. Realignment on Okinawa
(a) Futenma Replacement Facility (FRF)

l The United States and Japan will locate the FRF in a configuration that combines the Henoko-saki

and adjacent water areas of Oura and Henoko Bays, including two runways aligned in a “V”-shape,
each runway having a length of 1,600 meters plus two 100-meter overruns. The length of each
runway portion of the facility is 1,800 meters, exclusive of seawalls (see attached concept plan
dated April 28, 2006). This facility ensures agreed operational capabilities while addressing issues
of safety, noise, and environmental impacts.

l In order to locate the FRF, inclusive of agreed support facilities, in the Camp Schwab area, necessary

adjustments will be made, such as reconfiguration of Camp Schwab facilities and adjacent water
surface areas.

l Construction of the FRF is targeted for completion by 2014.
l Relocation to the FRF will occur when the facility is fully operationally capable.
l Facility improvements for contingency use at ASDF bases at Nyutabaru and Tsuiki related to

replacement of Marine Corps Air Station (MCAS) Futenma capabilities will be made, as necessary,
after conducting site surveys and before MCAS Futenma is returned.

l Requirements for improved contingency use of civilian facilities will be examined in the context of

bilateral contingency planning, and appropriate arrangements will be made in order to realize the
return of MCAS Futenma.


-----

l In principle, the construction method for the FRF will be landfill.
l The USG does not intend to operate fighter aircraft from this facility.
(b) Force Reductions and Relocation to Guam

l Approximately 8,000 III Marine Expeditionary Force (MEF) personnel and their approximately 9,000

dependents will relocate from Okinawa to Guam by 2014, in a manner that maintains unit integrity.
Units to relocate will include: III MEF Command Element, 3rd Marine Division Headquarters,
3rd Marine Logistics Group (formerly known as Force Service Support Group) Headquarters, 1st
Marine Air Wing Headquarters, and 12th Marine Regiment Headquarters.

l The affected units will relocate from such facilities as Camp Courtney, Camp Hansen, MCAS

Futenma, Camp Zukeran, and Makiminato Service Area.

l The U.S. Marine Corps (USMC) forces remaining on Okinawa will consist of Marine Air-Ground

Task Force elements, such as command, ground, aviation, and combat service support, as well as a
base support capability.

l Of the estimated $10.27 billion cost of the facilities and infrastructure development costs for the III

MEF relocation to Guam, Japan will provide $6.09 billion (in U.S. FY 2008 dollars), including $2.8
billion in direct cash contributions, to develop facilities and infrastructure on Guam to enable the
III MEF relocation, recognizing the strong desire of Okinawa residents that such force relocation
be realized rapidly. The United States will fund the remainder of the facilities and infrastructure
development costs for the relocation to Guam estimated in U.S. FY 2008 dollars at $3.18 billion in
fiscal spending plus approximately $1 billion for a road.
(c) Land Returns and Shared Use of Facilities

l Following the relocation to the FRF, the return of MCAS Futenma, and the transfer of III MEF

personnel to Guam, the remaining facilities and areas on Okinawa will be consolidated, thereby
enabling the return of significant land areas south of Kadena Air Base.

l Both sides will develop a detailed consolidation plan by March 2007. In this plan, total or partial

return of the following six candidate facilities will be examined:
m Camp Kuwae: Total return.
m Camp Zukeran: Partial return and consolidation of remaining facilities and infrastructure to the

extent possible.

m MCAS Futenma: Total return (see FRF section above).
m Makiminato Service Area: Total return.
m Naha Port: Total return (relocated to the new facilities, including additional staging constructed

at Urasoe).

l Army POL Depot Kuwae Tank Farm No. 1: Total return.
l All functions and capabilities that are resident in facilities designated for return, and that are required

by forces remaining in Okinawa, will be relocated within Okinawa. These relocations will occur
before the return of designated facilities.

l While emphasizing the importance of steady implementation of the recommendations of the Special

Action Committee on Okinawa (SACO) Final Report, the SACO relocation and return initiatives
may need to be re-evaluated.

l Camp Hansen will be used for GSDF training. Shared use that requires no facility improvements

will be possible from 2006.

l ASDF will use Kadena Air Base for bilateral training with U.S. forces, taking into account noise

impacts on local communities.
(d) Relationships among Initiatives


-----

l Within the overall package, the Okinawa-related realignment initiatives are interconnected.
l Specifically, consolidation and land returns south of Kadena depend on completing the relocation of

III MEF personnel and dependents from Okinawa to Guam.

l The III MEF relocation from Okinawa to Guam is dependent on: (1) tangible progress toward

completion of the FRF, and (2) Japan’s financial contributions to fund development of required
facilities and infrastructure on Guam.
2. Improvement of U.S. Army Command and Control Capability
l U.S. Army command and control structure at Camp Zama will be transformed by U.S. FY 2008. The

headquarters of the GSDF Central Readiness Force subsequently will arrive at Camp Zama by Japan FY
2012; SDF helicopters will have access to Kastner Heliport on Camp Zama.

l Along with the transformation of Army headquarters in Japan, a battle command training center and

other support facilities will be constructed within Sagami General Depot (SGD) using U.S. funding.

l In relation to this transformation, the following measures for efficient and effective use of Camp Zama

and SGD will be implemented.
m Some portions of land at SGD will be returned for local redevelopment (approximately 15 hectares

(ha)) and for road and underground rail (approximately 2ha). Affected housing units will be relocated
to Sagamihara Housing Area.

m A specified area of open space in the northwest section of SGD (approximately 35ha) will be provided

for local use when not required for contingency or training purposes.

m Portions of the Chapel Hill housing area of Camp Zama (1.1ha) will be returned to the GOJ following

relocation of affected housing units within Camp Zama. Further discussions on possible additional
land returns at Chapel Hill will occur as appropriate.
3. Yokota Air Base and Airspace
l ASDF Air Defense Command (ADC) and relevant units will relocate to Yokota Air Base in Japan FY

2010. A bilateral master plan for base use will be developed to accommodate facility and infrastructure
requirements.

l A bilateral, joint operations coordination center (BJOCC), established at Yokota Air Base, will include a

collocated air and missile defense coordination function. The USG and GOJ will fund their own required
equipment and systems, respectively, while both sides will coordinate appropriate funding of shared-use
equipment and systems.

l The following measures will be pursued to facilitate movement of civilian aircraft through Yokota

airspace while satisfying military operational requirements.
m Establish a program in Japan FY 2006 to inform commercial aviation entities of existing procedures

to transit Yokota airspace.

m Return portions of Yokota airspace to Japanese control by September 2008; specific portions will be

identified by October 2006.

m Develop procedures in Japan FY 2006 for temporary transfers of air traffic control responsibility to

Japanese authorities for portions of Yokota airspace, when not required for military purposes.

m Study the conditions required for the possible return of the entire Yokota airspace as part of a

comprehensive study of options for related airspace reconfigurations and changes in air traffic control
procedures that would satisfy future patterns of civilian and military (U.S. and Japanese) demand for
use of Japanese airspace. The study will take into account both the lessons learned from the Kadena
radar approach control (RAPCON) transfer experience and the lessons learned from experiences with
collocation of U.S. forces and Japanese controllers in Japan. This study will be completed in Japan FY
2009.


-----

l The USG and GOJ will conduct a study of the specific conditions and modalities for possible civilian
military dual-use of Yokota Air Base, to be completed within 12 months from commencement.
m The study will be conducted on the shared understanding that dual-use must not compromise military

operations and safety or the military operational capabilities of Yokota Air Base.

m Based upon the outcome of this study, the two governments will consult and then make appropriate

decisions on civilian-military dual-use.
4. Relocation of Carrier Air Wing from Atsugi Air Facility to Marine Corps Air Station (MCAS) Iwakuni
l The relocation of Carrier Air Wing Five (CVW-5) squadrons from Atsugi Air Facility to MCAS Iwakuni,

consisting of F/A-18, EA-6B, E-2C, and C-2 aircraft, will be completed by 2014, subsequent to the
following: (1) completion of necessary facilities, and (2) adjustment of training airspace and the Iwakuni
RAPCON airspace.

l Necessary facilities will be developed at Atsugi Air Facility to accommodate MSDF E/O/UP-3 squadrons

and other aircraft from Iwakuni, taking into account the continued requirement for U.S. operations from
Atsugi.

l The KC-130 squadron will be based at MCAS Iwakuni with its headquarters, maintenance support

facilities, and family support facilities. The aircraft will regularly deploy on a rotational basis for
training and operations to MSDF Kanoya Base and Guam. To support the deployment of KC-l30 aircraft,
necessary facilities will be developed at Kanoya.

l U.S. Marine Corps CH-53D helicopters will be relocated from MCAS Iwakuni to Guam when the III

MEF personnel relocate from Okinawa to Guam.

l Training airspace and Iwakuni RAPCON airspace will be adjusted to fulfill safely the training and

operational requirements of U.S. forces, Japan SDF, and commercial aircraft (including those in
neighboring airspace) through coordination by the Joint Committee.

l A bilateral framework to conduct a study on a permanent field-carrier landing practice facility will

be established, with the goal of selecting a permanent site by July 2009 or the earliest possible date
thereafter.

l Portions of the future civilian air facility will be accommodated at MCAS Iwakuni.
5. Missile Defense
l As both sides deploy additional capabilities and improve their respective ballistic missile defense

capabilities, close coordination will continue.

l The optimum site for deployment of a new U.S. X-Band radar system has been designated as ASDF

Shariki Base. Necessary arrangements and facility modifications, funded by the USG, will be made
before the radar becomes operational in summer 2006.

l The USG will share X-Band radar data with the GOJ.
l U.S. Patriot PAC-3 capabilities will be deployed to Japan within existing U.S. facilities and areas,

becoming operational at the earliest possible time.
6. Training Relocation
l Both sides will develop annual bilateral training plans beginning in Japan FY 2007. As necessary, a

supplemental plan for Japan FY 2006 can be developed.

l Initially, aircraft from three U.S. facilities—Kadena, Misawa, and Iwakuni—will participate in relocated

training conducted from the following SDF facilities: Chitose, Misawa, Hyakuri, Komatsu, Tsuiki,
and Nyutabaru. Both sides will work toward expanding use of SDF facilities for bilateral training and
exercises in the future.

l The GOJ will improve infrastructure for training relocation at SDF facilities as necessary after conducting

site surveys.


-----

l Relocated training will not diminish the quality of training that is currently available to U.S. forces in

Japan, taking into account facilities and training requirements.

l In general, bilateral training will commence with participation of 1-5 aircraft for the duration of 1-7 days,

and develop over time to participation of 6-12 aircraft for 8-14 days at a time.

l At those SDF facilities at which terms of joint use are stipulated by Joint Committee agreements,

limitations on the number of joint training events will be removed. Limitations on the total days and
period per training event for joint use of each SDF facility will be maintained.

l The USG and GOJ will share costs for bilateral training as appropriate, bearing in mind the priority of

maintaining readiness.

**Reference 38. Efforts by the Government of Japan regarding Realignment of U.S. Force**

**Structure in Japan and Others**

(May 30, 2006 Cabinet Decision)

1. The Governments of Japan and the U.S. had a series of consultations regarding examinations of the

roles, missions and capabilities of Japan’s Self-Defense Forces (SDF) and the U.S. Armed Forces, and of
realignment of U.S. force structure in Japan. And at the Security Consultative Committee (SCC) Meeting of
October 29, 2005, recommendations on those issues were approved. The governments of the two countries
continued consultations and at the SCC Meeting of May 1, 2006 the final report including specific initiatives
for realignment of U.S. force structure in Japan and other issues (hereinafter “realignment related measures”)
was approved.
2. In the new security environment, it is important to maintain and develop the Japan-U.S. Security Arrangements

to ensure the security of Japan and maintain the peace and stability of the Asia-Pacific region in a continuous
manner. Stationing of the U.S. forces in Japan is at the core of the Japan-U.S. Security Arrangements, and
stable use of facilities and areas of the U.S. forces needs to be secured.

Facilities and areas used by the U.S. forces concentrate on Okinawa, and areas around facilities and

areas on the mainland are increasingly urbanized, hence these facilities and areas have great impact on the
living environment of residents and regional development. In light of such conditions, it is important to
maintain deterrence and capabilities while reducing burdens on local communities, in order to secure stable
use of facilities and areas by gaining broader public understanding and cooperation as well as to maintain
and develop the Japan-U.S. Security Arrangements.
3. The final report includes the following specific initiatives: relocation of approximately 8,000 Marine
Corps personnel from Okinawa where facilities and areas used by the U.S. forces concentrate; relocation
of Futenma Air Station to Camp Schwab; return of significant land areas south of Kadena Air Base which
are densely populated (including total returns of Futenma Air Station, Makiminato Service Area, Naha port
facilities and other facilities); collocation of ASDF Air Defense Command and relevant units at Yokota Air
Base to enhance coordination between the headquarters; transformation of the U.S. Army command and
control structure at Camp Zama; deployment of a new U.S. X-Band radar system for BMD at ASDF Shariki
Base; relocation of Carrier Air Wing from Atsugi Air Facility to Iwakuni Air Station; return of some portions
of Camp Zama and Sagami General Depot; and relocation of trainings.

These realignment related measures shall be steadily implemented based on the timeframe for

implementation presented in the final report.
4. Ensuring security arrangements for maintenance of the peace and security of Japan is one of the most


-----

significant policies of the Japanese government, therefore, it is necessary for the government to address
the issue with responsibility. Based on such recognition, in implementing realignment related measures
that entail new burdens on the part of local authorities, the government will take requests from the local
authorities that shoulder such burdens into consideration, and take measures for regional development and
other in return for their contributions to the peace and security of Japan.

In addition, the Government of Japan will continue to be totally committed to taking measures in

promotion of the use of returned land and securing employment stability of workers at USFJ facilities and
areas.
5. Relocation of Marine units in Okinawa to Guam is critical in reducing burdens on Okinawa where U.S.
facilities and areas concentrate, thus it shall be rapidly implemented with required costs shared by Japan.
6. Based on such recognition, the Government of Japan shall properly and promptly implement realignment
related measures including legal and budgetary aspects. Meanwhile, under the strained state of public finance,
the Government of Japan shall make efforts in more drastic rationalization and streamlining of defenserelated expenses to implement an efficient defense program, in line with the efforts of the government as
a whole in cost-cutting and rationalization. The “Mid-Term Defense Program (for FY 2005 to FY 2009)”
(approved by the Cabinet on December 10, 2004) shall be reviewed once estimates for the entire costs
of realignment related measures become clear based on concrete contents of realignment of U.S. force
structure in Japan and others.
7. As to relocation of Futenma Air Station, it shall be implemented based on the plan approved at the SCC
Meeting on May 1, 2006, with due consideration on the positions of the national government, the local
government of Okinawa and relevant local authorities, as well as the course of discussions so far regarding
the issues such as facilities related with relocation of Futenma Air Station, the basing agreement and regional
development and others, through paying enough attention to removal of danger of Futenma Air Station,
safety of lives of residents in the vicinity, preservation of natural environment and feasibility of the program.
Also a construction plan for the Futenma Replacement Facility (FRF) shall be formulated in a prompt
manner.

The government shall establish a consultative body together with the Government of Okinawa and

relevant local governments to have consultations about and address the issues of a concrete construction
plan of the FRF, safety and environmental measures and regional development.

In accordance with this, the Government Policy Concerning Relocation of Futenma Air Station (approved

by the Cabinet on December 28, 1999) shall be abolished.

However, in FY 2006, the projects based on the “II Regional Development” stipulated in the

abovementioned government policy shall be implemented.

**Reference 39. Joint Statement of the U.S.-Japan Security Consultative Committee U.S.**

**Department of State**

(Washington, DC, May 1, 2007)

**Alliance Transformation: Advancing United States-Japan Security and Defense Cooperation**
**I. Overview**
The U.S.-Japan security relationship is the bedrock of Japan’s defense and the keystone of peace and security in
the Asia-Pacific region. The members of the Security Consultative Committee (SCC) welcomed recent advances
in bilateral security and defense cooperation, consistent with the vision laid out in SCC meetings and statements


-----

over the past two years. The North Korean provocations, including missile launches in July and a nuclear test in
October 2006, serve as stark reminders of the importance of transforming the U.S.-Japan Alliance to ensure its
continued effectiveness in an ever-changing security environment.

The SCC members recognized that, just as today’s expanding U.S.-Japan cooperation was enabled by

previous efforts to update and consolidate the alliance that began years ago, so too will investments that the two
countries make in the alliance today enable and ensure effective alliance responses to future challenges to peace
and security.

Additionally, the SCC members stressed the importance of the traditional role of the Treaty of Mutual

Cooperation and Security, which has enabled a life-of-the-alliance presence for U.S. forces in Japan while
providing U.S. security assurances to the Government of Japan. U.S. extended deterrence underpins the defense
of Japan and regional security. The U.S. reaffirmed that the full range of U.S. military capabilities—both nuclear
and non-nuclear strike forces and defensive capabilities—form the core of extended deterrence and support U.S.
commitments to the defense of Japan.

In this context, the SCC members emphasized the need to expand and deepen bilateral intelligence cooperation

and information sharing in order to respond more effectively to emerging security challenges. They also decided
to strengthen mechanisms to protect classified materials.

President George W. Bush and Prime Minister Shinzo Abe met on November 18, 2006 and called for a

review of U.S.-Japan bilateral security cooperation, especially in the area of ballistic missile defense (BMD),
reiterating its importance during their April 27, 2007 summit meeting. The SCC members focused on this agenda
today in the context of common strategic objectives and alliance transformation.

The SCC members also welcomed the elevation of Japan’s defense organization from agency to ministry

status and the redefinition of the Self-Defense Forces’ (SDF) international peace cooperation activities as part of
their primary missions.

**II. Common Strategic Objectives**
The U.S. and Japan are committed to promoting fundamental values such as basic human rights, democracy,
and the rule of law in the international community. On February 19, 2005, the SCC members identified common
strategic objectives that provide a broad basis for advancing bilateral cooperation.

At today’s meeting, the SCC members reconfirmed their commitment to these common strategic objectives,

taking the current international security environment into account. In this context, they welcomed the “Initial
Actions for the Implementation of the Joint Statement” adopted at the fifth round of the Six-Party Talks on
February 13, 2007, and urged North Korea to expeditiously meet its commitments described in the statement.

During their discussions, the SCC members highlighted the following strategic objectives that advance the

interests of both countries:

-  Achieving denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula through the Six-Party Talks and fully implementing the

Joint Statement of September 19, 2005, which envisions progress in other areas, including: the normalization of
relations between North Korea and the United States and Japan, respectively; resolution of humanitarian issues,
such as the matter of abductions; and commitment by all Six Parties to join efforts for lasting peace and stability
in Northeast Asia.

-  Achieving swift and full implementation of United Nations Security Council Resolution (UNSCR) 1718,

noting that all United Nations Member States remain obligated to comply with the provisions of that Chapter
VII resolution.

-  Recognizing the importance of China’s contributions to regional and global security, further encouraging China

to conduct itself as a responsible international stakeholder, improve transparency in its military affairs, and
maintain consistency between its stated policies and actions.


-----

-  Increasing cooperation to strengthen the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) forum as the preeminent

regional economic forum, recognizing its crucial role in promoting stability, security, and prosperity in the
region.

-  Supporting efforts made by the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) to promote democratic

values, good governance, the rule of law, human rights, fundamental freedoms, and a unified market economy
in Southeast Asia, and building regional capacity and cooperation on critical non-traditional and transnational
security issues bilaterally and through the ASEAN Regional Forum (ARF).

-  Further strengthening trilateral cooperation among the United States, Japan, and Australia in the region and

around the world, including in the areas of security and defense, based on shared democratic values and
interests.

-  Continuing to build upon partnerships with India to advance areas of common interests and increase cooperation,

recognizing that India’s continued growth is inextricably tied to the prosperity, freedom, and security of the
region.

-  Ensuring Afghanistan’s successful economic reconstruction and political stabilization, which is essential to

securing broader regional security and to defeating terrorism. To that end, the United States and Japan are both
committed to supporting Afghanistan’s transition, which requires reconstruction, development, and security.

-  Contributing to building a united, democratic Iraq capable of governing, defending, and sustaining itself, while

remaining an ally in the War on Terror.

-  Achieving swift, full implementation of UNSCR 1737 and 1747, aimed at bringing Iran into full compliance

with its International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) requirements. Noting the international community’s
continuing concerns regarding Iran’s activities in the Middle East, both countries share the view that Iran must
play a more positive role in the international community by demonstrating responsible behavior on the issue of
terrorism.

-  Achieving broader Japan-North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) cooperation, recognizing that NATO’s

global contributions to peace and security and the common strategic objectives of the U.S.-Japan Alliance are
consistent and complementary.

**III. Roles, Missions, and Capabilities**
On October 29, 2005, the SCC approved the document, “U.S.-Japan Alliance: Transformation and Realignment
for the Future,” which outlined initiatives on roles, missions, and capabilities of U.S. and Japanese forces.
Following through on the security agenda laid out in that SCC document is imperative to the alliance’s ability to
respond to diverse challenges in the contemporary security environment.

The SCC members reviewed progress in updating roles, missions, and capabilities in line with this alliance

transformation vision and highlighted:

-  The redefinition of the SDF’s primary mission to include international peacekeeping operations, international

disaster relief operations, and responses to situations in areas surrounding Japan, which reflects growing
attention to the importance of Japan’s contributions to improving the international security environment. In this
context, the SCC members discussed the SDF’s assistance for Iraq’s reconstruction efforts as well as its support
to coalition forces operating in the Indian Ocean.

-  Sustained progress in developing more specific planning to reflect the evolving security environment and to

better posture our two forces to operate together in a regional crisis. Because such planning requires further
coordination in a wide range of functions and fields, active participation of relevant ministries and agencies in
the bilateral planning process will remain vital.

-  Substantive agreement between the two governments concerning security measures for the protection

of classified military information, also known as a General Security of Military Information Agreement


-----

(GSOMIA). The GSOMIA will facilitate information exchange and establish a common basis of information
security contributing to sharing of intelligence and defense program and operational information.

-  Establishment of a bilateral Chemical, Biological, Radiological, and Nuclear (CBRN) Defense Working Group

to make steady progress in improving readiness and interoperability of U.S. and Japanese forces against CBRN
weapons, ensuring sustained operational capability in the event of an attack by weapons of mass destruction.

-  Establishment of a flexible, bilateral interagency coordination mechanism to coordinate policy, operational,

intelligence, and public affairs positions before and during crisis situations.

-  Execution of joint, bilateral training exercises to strengthen interoperability and advance alliance roles, missions,

and capabilities.

The SCC members, recognizing the growing importance of the U.S. force presence to Japanese and regional
security, stressed the requirement for appropriate resources to ensure the success of the alliance transformation
agenda. Both allies will also make best efforts to secure resources to improve alliance capabilities and to sustain
the presence of U.S. forces in Japan.

**IV. Implementation of the Realignment Roadmap**
The SCC members reaffirmed their resolve to steadily implement the realignment initiatives described in the
May 2006 SCC document, “United States-Japan Roadmap for Realignment Implementation.” These initiatives,
when implemented, will enhance U.S. and Japanese public support for the security alliance.

The SCC members reviewed and appreciated the progress made thus far with the initiatives described in the

“Roadmap” including:

-  The creation of a bilateral coordination mechanism in June 2006 providing implementation oversight for the

realignment initiatives;

-  Japanese Diet action on legislation and funding required to facilitate early implementation of realignment

initiatives;

-  Elaboration of the engineering and technical design for the Futenma Replacement Facility and the initiation of

surveys in the water areas offshore of Camp Schwab;

-  Significant cooperation toward relocation of the III Marine Expeditionary Force (MEF) personnel and their

dependents from Okinawa to Guam by 2014, including:

❍ The U.S. creation and funding of a Joint Guam Program Office to oversee planning and development of the

facilities in Guam;

❍ The launch of the U.S. environmental impact assessment process, including Notice of Intent to prepare an

Environmental Impact Statement, for the relocation of U.S. Marine Corps forces from Okinawa to Guam;
and

❍ Submission of the above-mentioned legislation to the Japanese Diet authorizing the Japan Bank for

International Cooperation (JBIC) to take appropriate measures under the direction of the Japanese government
to fulfill a portion of Japan’s financial commitments related to the relocation of III MEF personnel and their
dependents from Okinawa to Guam.

-  Commencement of the aircraft training relocation program in March 2007;

-  Implementation of flexible-use of Yokota airspace measures in September 2006, and agreement in October

2006 for return of portions of Yokota airspace to Japanese control by September 2008, and for collocation of
SDF controllers at the Yokota Radar Approach Control (RAPCON). These measures will help facilitate the
movement of civilian aircraft through Yokota airspace while satisfying military operational requirements; and

-  October 2006 launching of the Study Group on the specific conditions and modalities for possible civil-military

dual-use of Yokota Air Base, as specified in the “Roadmap.”

The SCC members reaffirmed that completion of the Futenma Replacement Facility, in accordance with the


-----

“Roadmap” by the target date of 2014, is the key to successful and timely implementation of the overall realignment
plan for Okinawa, including the III MEF relocation to Guam and subsequent consolidation of remaining facilities
and areas on Okinawa. The SCC members acknowledged the significant progress on a detailed consolidation
plan and directed their staffs to continue close consultations toward its completion.

The SCC members also appreciated continued progress in implementation of commitments under the 1996

Special Action Committee on Okinawa (SACO) final report, including return of the Senaha Communications
Facility in September 2006, and the Sobe Communications Facility and the Yomitan Auxiliary Airfield in
December 2006, totaling more than 300 hectares/750 acres.

**V. Strengthening BMD and Operational Cooperation**
Alliance BMD capabilities, which contribute to the alliance’s overall deterrence posture, are strengthened to the
extent that U.S. and Japanese systems can operate together effectively. The SCC members confirmed that, as both
countries develop and deploy capabilities, every effort must be made to ensure tactical, operational, and strategic
coordination. In that light, the United States and Japan will take appropriate measures, in close coordination, in
response to ballistic missile threats against alliance interests.

In this context, the SCC members highlighted the following areas of operational cooperation:

-  To strengthen operational cooperation, bilateral planning efforts must take into account missile defense

capabilities, today and in the foreseeable future. To that end, the two sides’ forces will clarify concepts, roles,
and missions for each side in the conduct of missile defense and related operations in response to ballistic
missile threats. At the same time, a policy-level forum will ensure that policy guidance for BMD operations is
unambiguous and current.

-  On October 29, 2005, the SCC directed the creation of a bilateral joint operations coordination center (BJOCC).

During the North Korean missile provocations of June-July 2006, the United States and Japan exchanged
information in a timely manner, including through an interim coordination facility at Yokota Air Base with
SDF liaisons. The success of this facility in ensuring that both sides had a common awareness of the evolving
situation validated the importance of continuous enhancement of bilateral policy/operational coordination
including through establishment of the BJOCC at Yokota Air Base.

-  Recognizing the importance of improving the situational awareness of U.S. forces and the SDF, the two sides

are committed to the routine sharing of BMD and related operational information directly with each other on a
real-time, continuous basis. The two sides will also develop a bilateral common operational picture (COP).

-  The two sides will establish a comprehensive information-sharing roadmap to identify broader operational

information and data to be shared in support of alliance roles, missions, and capabilities.

**VI. Enhancing BMD System Capabilities**
The SCC members noted with satisfaction that past alliance decisions about missile defense, coupled with recent
accelerated cooperation, have strengthened BMD capabilities in the region.

They highlighted key advances, including:

-  The operational deployment of a U.S. X-Band radar system to ASDF Shariki Base, Japan, with associated U.S.

delivery of radar data to Japanese forces.

-  The operational deployment of a U.S. PAC-3 battalion to Kadena Air Base, Japan.

-  The recent and continuing addition of Standard Missile (SM-3) defense capabilities to the forward-deployed

naval forces of the U.S. Pacific Fleet.

-  Japan’s decision to accelerate modification of its Aegis ships with SM-3 capabilities. Japan will complete

modification of DDG Kongo by the end of 2007, and will expedite modification of DDGs Chokai, Myoko, and
_Kirishima._


-----

-  Japan’s decision to expedite the deployment of PAC-3, which resulted in deployment of the first PAC-3 fire unit

in March 2007 and its goal to deploy 16 PAC-3 capable fire units by early 2010.

-  Priority focus on U.S.-Japan cooperative development of the next generation SM-3 interceptor. The basic

agreement on a framework for technology transfer reached by the two sides will facilitate progress on this
project as well as in future U.S.-Japan technology cooperation projects.

The SCC members confirmed that advancing the alliance transformation agenda for security and defense

cooperation will contribute to regional and global peace and security.

**Reference 40. Guidelines for Japan-U.S. Defense Cooperation**

(New York, September 23, 1997)

**I. The Aim of the Guidelines**
The aim of these Guidelines is to create a solid basis for more effective and credible Japan-U.S. cooperation under
normal circumstances, in case of an armed attack against Japan, and in situations in areas surrounding Japan. The
Guidelines also provide a general framework and policy direction for the roles and missions of the two countries
and ways of cooperation and coordination, both under normal circumstances and during contingencies.

**II. Basic Premises and Principles**
The Guidelines and programs under the Guidelines are consistent with the following basic premises and
principles.
1. The rights and obligations under the Treaty of Mutual Cooperation and Security between the United States of

America and Japan (the Japan-U.S. Security Treaty) and its related arrangements, as well as the fundamental
framework of the Japan-U.S. alliance, will remain unchanged.
2. Japan will conduct all its actions within the limitations of its Constitution and in accordance with such basic
positions as the maintenance of its exclusively defense-oriented policy and its three non-nuclear principles.
3. All actions taken by Japan and the U.S. will be consistent with basic principles of international law, including
the peaceful settlement of disputes and sovereign equality, and relevant international agreements such as the
U.N. Charter.
4. The Guidelines and programs under the Guidelines will not obligate either Government to take legislative,

budgetary or administrative measures. However, since the objective of the Guidelines and programs under
the Guidelines is to establish an effective framework for bilateral cooperation, the two Governments are
expected to reflect in an appropriate way the results of these efforts, based on their own judgments, in their
specific policies and measures. All actions taken by Japan will be consistent with its laws and regulations
then in effect.

**III. Cooperation under Normal Circumstances**
Both Governments will firmly maintain existing Japan-U.S. Security Arrangements. Each Government will make
efforts to maintain required defense postures. Japan will possess defense capability within the scope necessary
for self-defense on the basis of the “National Defense Program Outline.” In order to meet its commitments,
the United States will maintain its nuclear deterrent capability, its forward-deployed forces in the Asia-Pacific
region, and other forces capable of reinforcing those forward-deployed forces.

Both Governments, based on their respective policies, under normal circumstances will maintain

close cooperation for the defense of Japan as well as for the creation of a more stable international security


-----

environment.

Both Governments will under normal circumstances enhance cooperation in a variety of areas. Examples

include mutual support activities under the Agreement Between the Government of Japan and the Government of
the United States of America concerning Reciprocal Provision of Logistic Support, Supplies and Services between
the Self-Defense Forces of Japan and the Armed Forces of the United States of America; the Mutual Defense
Assistance Agreement between the United States of America and Japan; and their related arrangements.
1. Information Sharing and Policy Consultations
Recognizing that accurate information and sound analysis are at the foundation of security, the two
Governments will increase information and intelligence sharing, and the exchange of views on international
situations of mutual interest, especially in the Asia-Pacific region. They will also continue close consultations
on defense policies and military postures.

Such information sharing and policy consultations will be conducted at as many levels as possible and on

the broadest range of subjects. This will be accomplished by taking advantage of all available opportunities,
such as the Security Consultative Committee (SCC) and Security Sub-Committee (SSC) meetings.
2. Various Types of Security Cooperation
Bilateral cooperation to promote regional and global activities in the field of security contributes to the
creation of a more stable international security environment.

Recognizing the importance and significance of security dialogues and defense exchange in the region,

as well as international arms control and disarmament, the two Governments will promote such activities
and cooperate as necessary.

When either or both Governments participate in U.N. PKOs or international humanitarian relief

operations, the two sides will cooperate closely for mutual support as necessary. They will prepare procedures
for cooperation in such areas as transportation, medical services, information sharing, and education and
training.

When either or both Governments conduct emergency relief operations in response to requests from

governments concerned or international organizations in the wake of large-scale disasters, they will cooperate
closely with each other as necessary.
3. Bilateral Programs

Both Governments will conduct bilateral work, including bilateral defense planning in case of an armed
attack against Japan, and mutual cooperation planning in situations in areas surrounding Japan. Such efforts
will be made in a comprehensive mechanism involving relevant agencies of the respective Governments,
and establish the foundation for bilateral cooperation.

Bilateral exercises and training will be enhanced in order not only to validate such bilateral work but

also to enable smooth and effective responses by public and private entities of both countries, starting
with the SDF and U.S. forces. The two Governments will under normal circumstances establish a bilateral
coordination mechanism involving relevant agencies to be operated during contingencies.

**IV. Actions in Response to an Armed Attack against Japan**
Bilateral actions in response to an armed attack against Japan remain a core aspect of Japan-U.S. defense
cooperation.

When an armed attack against Japan is imminent, the two Governments will take steps to prevent further

deterioration of the situation and make preparations necessary for the defense of Japan. When an armed attack
against Japan takes place, the two Governments will conduct appropriate bilateral actions to repel it at the earliest
possible stage.
1. When an Armed Attack against Japan is Imminent


-----

The two Governments will intensify information and intelligence sharing and policy consultations, and
initiate at an early stage the operation of a bilateral coordination mechanism. Cooperating as appropriate,
they will make preparations necessary for ensuring coordinated responses according to the readiness stage
selected by mutual agreement. Japan will establish and maintain the basis for U.S. reinforcements. As
circumstances change, the two Governments will also increase intelligence gathering and surveillance, and
will prepare to respond to activities, which could develop into an armed attack against Japan.

The two Governments will make every effort, including diplomatic efforts, to prevent further deterioration

of the situation.

Recognizing that a situation in areas surrounding Japan may develop into an armed attack against Japan,

the two Governments will be mindful of the close interrelationship of the two requirements: preparations for
the defense of Japan and responses to or preparations for situations in areas surrounding Japan.
2. When an Armed Attack against Japan Takes Place

(1) Principles for Coordinated Bilateral Actions
(a) Japan will have primary responsibility immediately to take action and to repel an armed attack

against Japan as soon as possible. The U.S. will provide appropriate support to Japan. Such bilateral
cooperation may vary according to the scale, type, phase, and other factors of the armed attack.
This cooperation may include preparations for and execution of coordinated bilateral operations,
steps to prevent further deterioration of the situation, surveillance, and intelligence sharing.
(b) In conducting bilateral operations, the SDF and U.S. forces will employ their respective defense

capabilities in a coordinated, timely, and effective manner. In doing this, they will conduct
effective joint operations of their respective forces’ ground, maritime and air services. The SDF
will primarily conduct defensive operations in Japanese territory and its surrounding waters and
airspace, while U.S. forces support SDF operations. U.S. forces will also conduct operations to
supplement the capabilities of the SDF.
(c) The U.S. will introduce reinforcements in a timely manner, and Japan will establish and maintain

the basis to facilitate these deployments.
(2) Concept of Operations
(a) Operations to Counter Air Attack against Japan

The SDF and U.S. forces will bilaterally conduct operations to counter air attacks against Japan.
The SDF will have primary responsibility for conducting operations for air defense.

U.S. forces will support SDF operations and conduct operations, including those, which may

involve the use of strike power, to supplement the capabilities of the SDF.
(b) Operations to Defend Surrounding Waters and to Protect Sea Lines of Communication

The SDF and U.S. forces will bilaterally conduct operations for the defense of surrounding waters
and for the protection of sea lines of communication.

The SDF will have primary responsibility for the protection of major ports and straits in Japan,

for the protection of ships in surrounding waters, and for other operations.

U.S. forces will support SDF operations and conduct operations, including those, which may

provide additional mobility and strike power, to supplement the capabilities of the SDF.
(c) Operations to Counter Airborne and Seaborne Invasions of Japan

The SDF and U.S. forces will bilaterally conduct operations to counter airborne and seaborne
invasions of Japan.

The SDF will have primary responsibility for conducting operations to check and repel such

invasions.

U.S. forces will primarily conduct operations to supplement the capabilities of the SDF. The


-----

U.S. will introduce reinforcements at the earliest possible stage, according to the scale, type, and
other factors of the invasion, and will support SDF operations.
(d) Responses to Other Threats
(i) The SDF will have primary responsibility to check and repel guerrilla-commando type attacks or

any other unconventional attacks involving military infiltration in Japanese territory at the earliest
possible stage. They will cooperate and coordinate closely with relevant agencies, and will be
supported in appropriate ways by U.S. forces depending on the situation.
(ii) The SDF and U.S. forces will cooperate and coordinate closely to respond to a ballistic missile

attack. U.S. forces will provide Japan with necessary intelligence, and consider, as necessary, the
use of forces providing additional strike power.
(3) Activities and Requirements for Operations
(a) Command and Coordination

The SDF and U.S. forces, in close cooperation, will take action through their respective commandand-control channels. To conduct effective bilateral operations, the two Forces will establish, in
advance, procedures which include those to determine the division of roles and missions and to
synchronize their operations.
(b) Bilateral Coordination Mechanism

Necessary coordination among the relevant agencies of the two countries will be conducted through
a bilateral coordination mechanism. In order to conduct effective bilateral operations, the SDF and
U.S. forces will closely coordinate operations, intelligence activities, and logistics support through
this coordination mechanism including use of a bilateral coordination center.
(c) Communication and Electronics

The two Governments will provide mutual support to ensure effective use of communications and
electronics capabilities.
(d) Intelligence Activities

The two Governments will cooperate in intelligence activities in order to ensure effective
bilateral operations. This will include coordination of requirements, collection, production, and
dissemination of intelligence products. Each Government will be responsible for the security of
shared intelligence.
(e) Logistics Support Activities

The SDF and U.S. forces will conduct logistics support activities efficiently and properly in
accordance with appropriate bilateral arrangements.

To improve the effectiveness of logistics and to alleviate functional shortfalls, the two

Governments will undertake mutual support activities, making appropriate use of authorities and
assets of the central Government and local governments, as well as private sector assets.

Particular attention will be paid to the following points in conducting such activities:
(i) Supply

The U.S. will support the acquisition of supplies for systems of U.S. origin while Japan will support
the acquisition of supplies in Japan.
(ii) Transportation

The two Governments will closely cooperate in transportation operations, including airlift and
sealift of supplies from the U.S. to Japan.
(iii) Maintenance

Japan will support the maintenance of U.S. forces’ equipment in Japan. The U.S. will support
the maintenance of items of U.S. origin which are beyond Japanese maintenance capabilities.


-----

Maintenance support will include the technical training of maintenance personnel as required.
Japan will also support U.S. forces’ requirement for salvage and recovery.
(iv) Facilities

Japan will, in case of need, provide additional facilities and areas in accordance with the Japan-U.S.
Security Treaty and its related arrangements. If necessary for effective and efficient operations,
the SDF and U.S. forces will make joint use of SDF facilities and U.S. facilities and areas in
accordance with the Treaty and its related arrangements.
(v) Medical Services

The two Governments will support each other in the area of medical services such as medical
treatment and transportation of casualties.

**V. Cooperation in Situations in Areas Surrounding Japan that will Have Important Influence on**

**Japan’s Peace and Security (Situations in Areas Surrounding Japan)**

Situations in areas surrounding Japan will have an important influence on Japan’s peace and security. The concept,
situations in area surrounding Japan, is not geographic but situational. The two Governments will make every
effort, including diplomatic efforts, to prevent such situations from occurring. When the two Governments reach
a common assessment of the state of each situation, they will effectively coordinate their activities. In responding
to such situations, measures taken may differ depending on circumstances.
1. When a Situation in Areas Surrounding Japan is Anticipated

When a situation in areas surrounding Japan is anticipated, the two Governments will intensify information
and intelligence sharing and policy consultations, including efforts to reach a common assessment of the
situation.

At the same time, they will make every effort, including diplomatic efforts, to prevent further

deterioration of the situation, while initiating at an early stage the operation of a bilateral coordination
mechanism, including use of a bilateral coordination center. Cooperating as appropriate, they will make
preparations necessary for ensuring coordinated responses according to the readiness stage selected by
mutual agreement. As circumstances change, they will also increase intelligence gathering and surveillance,
and enhance their readiness to respond to the circumstances.
2. Responses to Situations in Areas Surrounding Japan

The two Governments will take appropriate measures, to include preventing further deterioration of
situations, in response to situations in areas surrounding Japan. This will be done in accordance with the
basic premises and principles listed in Section II above and based on their respective decisions. They will
support each other as necessary in accordance with appropriate arrangements.

Functions and fields of cooperation and examples of items of cooperation are outlined below, and listed

in the Annex.
(1) Cooperation in Activities Initiated by Either Government

Although either Government may conduct the following activities at its own discretion, bilateral
cooperation will enhance their effectiveness.
(a) Relief Activities and Measures to Deal with Refugees

Each Government will conduct relief activities with the consent and cooperation of the authorities
in the affected area. The two Governments will cooperate as necessary, taking into account their
respective capabilities.

The two Governments will cooperate in dealing with refugees as necessary. When there is a

flow of refugees into Japanese territory, Japan will decide how to respond and will have primary
responsibility for dealing with the flow; the U.S. will provide appropriate support.


-----

(b) Search and Rescue

The two Governments will cooperate in search and rescue operations. Japan will conduct search
and rescue operations in Japanese territory; and at sea around Japan, as distinguished from areas
where combat operations are being conducted. When U.S. forces are conducting operations, the
United States will conduct search and rescue operations in and near the operational areas.
(c) Noncombatant Evacuation Operations

When the need arises for Japanese and U.S. noncombatants to be evacuated from a third country
to a safe haven, each Government is responsible for evacuating its own nationals as well as for
dealing with the authorities of the affected area. When both Governments deem it appropriate, they
will coordinate in planning and cooperate in carrying out such evacuations, including matters that
affect the securing of means of transportation and the use of transportation and facilities, using
their respective capabilities in a mutually supplementary manner. Should a similar need arise with
regard to noncombatants other than of Japanese or U.S. nationality, the respective countries may
consider extending, on their respective terms, evacuation assistance to third country nationals.
(d) Activities for Ensuring the Effectiveness of Economic Sanctions for the Maintenance of

International Peace and Stability
Each Government will contribute to activities for ensuring the effectiveness of economic sanctions
for the maintenance of international peace and stability. Such contributions will be made in
accordance with each Government’s own criteria.

Additionally, the two Governments will cooperate with each other as appropriate, taking

into account their respective capabilities. Such cooperation includes information sharing, and
cooperation in inspection of ships based on U.N. Security Council resolutions.
(2) Japan’s Support for U.S. Forces Activities
(a) Use of Facilities

Based on the Japan-U.S. Security Treaty and its related arrangements, Japan will, in case of need,
provide additional facilities and areas in a timely and appropriate manner, and ensure the temporary
use by U.S. forces of SDF facilities and civilian airports and ports.
(b) Rear Area Support

Japan will provide rear area support to those U.S. forces that are conducting operations for the
purpose of achieving the objectives of the Japan-U.S. Security Treaty. The primary aim of this rear
area support is to enable U.S. forces to use facilities and conduct operations in an effective manner.
By its very nature, Japan’s rear area support will be provided primarily in Japanese territory. It may
also be provided on the high seas and international airspace around Japan which are distinguished
from areas where combat operations are being conducted.

In providing rear area support, Japan will make appropriate use of the authority and capacity

of the central Government and local governments, as well as private sector capacity. The SDF, as
appropriate, will provide such support consistent with their mission for the defense of Japan and
the maintenance of public order.
(3) Japan-U.S. Operational Cooperation

As situations in areas surrounding Japan have an important influence on Japan’s peace and security, the
SDF will conduct such activities as intelligence gathering, surveillance and minesweeping, to protect
lives and property and to ensure navigational safety. U.S. forces will conduct operations to restore the
peace and security affected by situations in areas surrounding Japan.

With the involvement of relevant agencies, cooperation and coordination will significantly enhance

the effectiveness of both Forces’ activities.


-----

**VI. Bilateral Programs for Effective Defense Cooperation under the Guidelines**
Effective bilateral cooperation under the Guidelines will require Japan and the U.S. to conduct consultative
dialogue throughout the spectrum of security conditions: normal circumstances, an armed attack against Japan,
and situations in areas surrounding Japan. Both sides must be well informed and coordinate at multiple levels to
ensure successful bilateral defense cooperation. To accomplish this, the two Governments will strengthen their
information and intelligence sharing and policy consultations by taking advantage of all available opportunities,
including, SCC and SSC meetings, and they will establish the following two mechanisms to facilitate consultations,
coordinate policies, and coordinate operational functions.

First, the two Governments will develop a comprehensive mechanism for bilateral planning and the

establishment of common standards and procedures, involving not only the SDF and U.S. forces but also other
relevant agencies of their respective Governments.

The two Governments will, as necessary, improve this comprehensive mechanism. The SCC will continue to

play an important role in presenting policy direction for the work to be conducted by this mechanism. The SCC
will be responsible for presenting policy, validating the progress of work, and issuing directives as necessary. The
SDC will assist the SCC in bilateral work.

Second, the two Governments will also establish, under normal circumstances, a bilateral coordination

mechanism that will include relevant agencies of the two countries for coordinating respective activities during
contingencies.
1. Bilateral Work for Planning and the Establishment of Common Standards and Procedures
Bilateral work listed below will be conducted under a comprehensive mechanism, involving relevant
agencies of the respective Governments in a deliberate and efficient manner. Progress and results of such
work will be reported at significant intervals to the SCC and the SDC.
(1) Bilateral Defense Planning and Mutual Cooperation Planning

The SDF and U.S. forces will conduct bilateral defense planning under normal circumstances to
take coordinated actions smoothly and effectively in case of an armed attack against Japan. The two
Governments will conduct mutual cooperation planning under normal circumstances to be able to
respond smoothly and effectively to situations in areas surrounding Japan.

Bilateral defense planning and mutual cooperation planning will assume various possible situations,

with the expectation that the results of this planning work will be appropriately reflected in the plans
of the two Governments. The two Governments will coordinate and adjust their plans in light of actual
circumstances. The two Governments will be mindful that bilateral defense planning and mutual
cooperation planning must be consistent so that appropriate responses will be ensured when a situation
in areas surrounding Japan threatens to develop into an armed attack against Japan or when such a
situation and an armed attack against Japan occur simultaneously.
(2) Establishment of Common Standards for Preparations

The two Governments will establish under normal circumstances common standards for preparations
for the defense of Japan. These standards will address such matters as intelligence activities, unit
activities, movements and logistics support in each readiness stage. When an armed attack against Japan
is imminent, both Governments will agree to select a common readiness stage that will be reflected in
the level of preparations for the defense of Japan by U.S. forces, the SDF and other relevant agencies.

The two Governments will similarly establish common standards for preparations of cooperative

measures in situations in areas surrounding Japan so that they may select a common readiness stage by
mutual agreement.
(3) Establishment of Common Procedures

The two Governments will prepare in advance common procedures to ensure smooth and effective


-----

execution of coordinated U.S. forces and SDF operations for the defense of Japan. These will
include procedures for communications, transmission of target information, intelligence activities
and logistics support, and prevention of fratricide. Common procedures will also include criteria for
properly controlling respective unit operations. The two Forces will take into account the importance
of communications and electronics interoperability, and will determine in advance their mutual
requirements.
2. Bilateral Coordination Mechanism
The two Governments will establish under normal circumstances a bilateral coordination mechanism
involving relevant agencies of the two countries to coordinate respective activities in case of an armed attack
against Japan and in situations in areas surrounding Japan.

Procedures for coordination will vary depending upon items to be coordinated and agencies to be

involved. They may include coordination committee meetings, mutual dispatch of liaison officers, and
designation of points of contact. As part of such a bilateral coordination mechanism, the SDF and U.S.
forces will prepare under normal circumstances a bilateral coordination center with the necessary hardware
and software in order to coordinate their respective activities.

**VII. Timely and Appropriate Review of the Guidelines**
The two Governments will review the Guidelines in a timely and appropriate manner when changes in situations
relevant to the Japan-U.S. security relationship occur and if deemed necessary in view of the circumstances at
that time.

**Reference 43. The SACO Final Report**

(December 2, 1996)

The Special Action Committee on Okinawa (SACO) was established in November 1995 by the Governments
of Japan and the United States. The two Governments launched the SACO process to reduce the burden on the
people of Okinawa and thereby strengthen the Japan-U.S. alliance.

The mandate and guidelines for the SACO process were set forth by the Governments of Japan and the United

States at the outset of the joint endeavor. Both sides decided that the SACO would develop recommendations
for the Security Consultative Committee (SCC) on ways to realign, consolidate and reduce U.S. facilities and
areas, and adjust operational procedures of U.S. forces in Okinawa consistent with their respective obligations
under the Treaty of Mutual Cooperation and Security and other related agreements. The work of the SACO was
scheduled to conclude after one year.

The SCC which was held on April 15, 1996, approved the SACO Interim Report which included several

significant initiatives, and instructed the SACO to complete and recommend plans with concrete implementation
schedules by November 1996.

The SACO, together with the Joint Committee, has conducted a series of intensive and detailed discussions

and developed concrete plans and measures to implement the recommendations set forth in the Interim Report.

Today, at the SCC, Minister Ikeda, Minister Kyuma, Secretary Perry and Ambassador Mondale approved this

SACO Final Report. The plans and measures included in this Final Report, when implemented, will reduce the
impact of the activities of U.S. forces on communities in Okinawa. At the same time, these measures will fully
maintain the capabilities and readiness of U.S. forces in Japan while addressing security and force protection
requirements. Approximately 21 percent of the total acreage of the U.S. facilities and areas in Okinawa excluding
joint use facilities and areas (approx. 5,002ha/12,361 acres) will be returned.

Upon approving the Final Report, the members of the SCC welcomed the successful conclusion of the

year-long SACO process and underscored their strong resolve to continue joint efforts to ensure steady and
prompt implementation of the plans and measures of the SACO Final Report. With this understanding, the
SCC designated the Joint Committee as the primary forum for bilateral coordination in the implementation
phase, where specific conditions for the completion of each item will be addressed. Coordination with local
communities will take place as necessary.

The SCC also reaffirmed the commitment of the two governments to make every endeavor to deal with

various issues related to the presence and status of U.S. forces, and to enhance mutual understanding between
U.S. forces and local Japanese communities. In this respect, the SCC agreed that efforts to these ends should
continue, primarily through coordination at the Joint Committee.

The members of the SCC agreed that the SCC itself and the Security Sub-Committee (SSC) would monitor

such coordination at the Joint Committee described above and provide guidance as appropriate. The SCC also
instructed the SSC to seriously address the Okinawa-related issues as one of the most important subjects and
regularly report back to the SCC on this subject.

In accordance with the April 1996 Japan-U.S. Joint Declaration on Security, the SCC emphasized the

importance of close consultation on the international situation, defense policies and military postures, bilateral
policy coordination and efforts towards a more peaceful and stable security environment in the Asia-Pacific
region. The SCC instructed the SSC to pursue these goals and to address the Okinawa-related issues at the same
time.

**The SACO Final Report on Futenma Air Station (an integral part of the SACO Final Report)**

(Tokyo, Japan, December 2, 1996)
1. Introduction
a. At the Security Consultative Committee (SCC) held on December 2, 1996, Minister Ikeda, Minister

Kyuma, Secretary Perry, and Ambassador Mondale reaffirmed their commitment to the Special Action
Committee on Okinawa (SACO) Interim Report of April 15, 1996 and the Status Report of September
19, 1996. Based on the SACO Interim Report, both Governments have been working to determine a
suitable option for the return of Futenma Air Station and the relocation of its assets to other facilities
and areas in Okinawa, while maintaining the airfield’s critical military functions and capabilities. The
Status Report called for the Special Working Group on Futenma to examine three specific alternatives: 1)
incorporate the heliport into Kadena Air Base; 2) construct a heliport at Camp Schwab; and 3) develop
and construct a sea-based facility (SBF).
b. On December 2, 1996, the SCC approved the SACO recommendation to pursue the SBF option. Compared

to the other two options, the SBF is judged to be the best option in terms of enhanced safety and quality
of life for the Okinawan people while maintaining operational capabilities of U.S. forces. In addition, the
SBF can function as a fixed facility during its use as a military base and can also be removed when no
longer necessary.


-----

c. The SCC will establish a bilateral U.S.-Japan working group under the supervision of the Security

Sub-Committee (SSC) entitled the Futenma Implementation Group (FIG), to be supported by a team of
technical experts. The FIG, working with the Joint Committee, will develop a plan for implementation no
later than December 1997. Upon SCC approval of this plan, the FIG, working with the Joint Committee,
will oversee design, construction, testing, and transfer of assets. Throughout this process, the FIG will
periodically report to the SSC on the status of its work.
2. Decisions of the SCC
a. Pursue construction of an SBF to absorb most of the helicopter operational functions of Futenma

Air Station. This facility will be approximately 1,500 meters long, and will support the majority of
Futenma Air Station’s flying operations, including an Instrument Flight Rules (IFR)—capable runway
(approximately 1,300 meters long), direct air operations support, and indirect support infrastructure such
as headquarters, maintenance, logistics, quality-of-life functions, and base operating support. The SBF
will be designed to support basing of helicopter assets, and will also be able to support short-field aircraft
operations.
b. Transfer 12 KC-130 aircraft to Iwakuni Air Base. Construct facilities at this base to ensure that associated

infrastructure is available to support these aircraft and their missions.
c. Develop additional facilities at Kadena Air Base to support aircraft, maintenance, and logistics operations

which are currently available at Futenma Air Station but are not relocated to the SBF or Iwakuni Air
Base.
d. Study the emergency and contingency use of alternate facilities which may be needed in the event of

a crisis. This is necessary because the transfer of functions from Futenma Air Station to the SBF will
reduce operational flexibility currently available.
e. Return Futenma Air Station within the next five to seven years, after adequate replacement facilities are

completed and operational.
3. Guiding Principles
a. Futenma Air Station’s critical military functions and capabilities will be maintained and will continue to

operate at current readiness levels throughout the transfer of personnel and equipment and the relocation
of facilities.
b. To the greatest extent possible, Futenma Air Station’s operations and activities will be transferred to the

SBF. Operational capabilities and contingency planning flexibility which cannot be supported by the
shorter runway of the SBF (such as strategic airlift, logistics, emergency alternate divert, and contingency
throughput) must be fully supported elsewhere. Those facilities unable to be located on the SBF, due to
operational cost, or quality-of-life considerations, will be located on existing U.S. facilities and areas.
c. The SBF will be located off the east coast of the main island of Okinawa, and is expected to be connected

to land by a pier or causeway. Selection of the location will take into account operational requirements,
airspace and sea-lane deconfliction, fishing access, environmental compatibility, economic effects, noise
abatement, survivability, security, and convenient, acceptable personnel access to other U.S. military
facilities and housing.
d. The design of the SBF will incorporate adequate measures to ensure platform, aircraft, equipment, and

personnel survivability against severe weather and ocean conditions; corrosion control treatment and
prevention for the SBF and all equipment located on the SBF; safety; and platform security. Support
will include reliable and secure fuel supply, electrical power, fresh water, and other utilities and
consumables.

Additionally, the facility will be fully self-supporting for short-period contingency/emergency
operations.


-----

e. The Government of Japan will provide the SBF and other relocation facilities for the use of U.S. forces,

in accordance with the U.S.-Japan Treaty of Mutual Cooperation and Security and the Status of Forces
Agreement. The two Governments will further consider all aspects of life-cycle costs as part of the
design/acquisition decision.
f. The Government of Japan will continue to keep the people of Okinawa informed of the progress of this

plan, including concept, location, and schedules of implementation.
4. Possible Sea-Based Facility Construction Methods
Studies have been conducted by a “Technical Support Group” comprised of Government engineers under the
guidance of a “Technical Advisory Group” comprised of university professors and other experts outside the
Government. These studies suggested that all three construction methods mentioned below are technically
feasible.
a. Pile Supported Pier Type (using floating modules)—supported by a number of steel columns fixed to the

sea bed.
b. Pontoon Type—platform consisting of steel pontoon type units, installed in a calm sea protected by a

breakwater.
c. Semi-Submersible Type—platform at a wave free height, supported by buoyancy of the lower structure

submerged under the sea.
5. The Next Steps
a. The FIG will recommend a candidate SBF area to the SCC as soon as possible and formulate a detailed

implementation plan no later than December 1997. This plan will include completion of the following
items: concept development and definitions of operational requirements, technology performance
specifications and construction method, site survey, environmental analysis, and final concept and site
selection.
b. The FIG will establish phases and schedules to achieve operational capabilities at each location, including

facility design, construction, installation of required components, validation tests and suitability
demonstrations, and transfer of operations to the new facility.
c. The FIG will conduct periodic reviews and make decisions at significant milestones concerning SBF

program feasibility.

**Reference 44. Basic Plan regarding Response Measures based on the Special Measures**

**Law for Humanitarian and Reconstruction Assistance in Iraq**

(Approved by the Cabinet on December 9, 2005)

(Partially revised on December 12, 2006)

**1. Basic Principles**
On March 20, 2003, the United States and other countries began to use force against Iraq as the last resort to
remove the threat posed by Iraq against the peace and security of the international community. Major combat
operations in Iraq have ended, and the international community has been actively engaged in reconstruction
assistance to Iraq.

That Iraq be rebuilt as a peaceful and democratic state while maintaining its sovereignty and territorial unity

is of utmost importance not only for the people of Iraq and to the peace and stability of the Middle East, but also
to securing peace and stability in the international community including Japan which depends on the Middle East
for nearly 90% of its oil imports.

Japan’s aid to Iraq has consisted of two major pillars—humanitarian and reconstruction assistance being

provided by the SDF and official development assistance being extended by the Foreign Ministry. Based on the
idea, Japan has extended as much assistance as possible, on its own initiative and proactively, to Iraq, taking
into account the will of the international community expressed in United Nations Security Council Resolutions
1483 and 1511, so that Iraq will be reconstructed as early as possible by the people of Iraq themselves. Based
on the Special Measures Law for Humanitarian and Reconstruction Assistance in Iraq (Law No.137 of 2003,
hereinafter called the “Iraq Special Measures Law”), Japan dispatched SDF units to Muthanna Province and
other places in Iraq. At a time when Iraq restored its sovereignty and moved toward full-fledged restoration,
which is mentioned in U.N. Security Council Resolution 1546, Japan further supported the efforts of Iraqi people
and the international community, and enhanced its assistance so that rehabilitation of Iraq will progress steadily.
Thanks to international backing as mentioned above, an election for the National Assembly was held in Iraq
based on the newly adopted Constitution, leading to the formation of a new Government and concluding the
political process specified in U.N. Security Council Resolution 1546. In addition, the Iraqi security force has taken
root and the process of transferring security authority from the U.N. multilateral force has advanced, marking
the first step forward toward full-scale reconstruction led by the people of Iraq on their own initiative under
democratic government. In the future, Japan will strive to make fruitful results of its reconstruction assistance
take root in Iraq and will try to establish relations of broad and long-term partnership with the country. In light
of the continued support of Iraq by the United Nations and the multilateral force, including the adoption of U.N.
Security Council Resolution 1723 that extends the authority of the multinational force for one year upon request
of the Iraqi transitional government, Japan will carry out activities for humanitarian and reconstruction assistance
and other response measures based on the Iraq Special Measures Law.

**2. Matters Regarding Implementation of Activities for Humanitarian and Reconstruction**

**Assistance**
(1) Basic Matters Regarding Activities for Humanitarian and Reconstruction Assistance

Iraq, in the first place, was ravaged by a quarter century of oppressive rule, and development of its social
infrastructure was delayed. Its government collapsed following the use of force by the United States and
other countries in March 2003. Thus, its people were thrown into a difficult situation, making the need
for humanitarian and reconstruction assistance extremely important. In particular, in the area of medical
services, there were shortfalls regarding operation, maintenance and management of hospitals including


-----

insufficiency in medical equipment. Besides the supply of electricity and water, supply networks at the
national level were not functioning sufficiently, becoming major issues in certain regions.

Therefore, expeditious assistance in these areas was necessary. Furthermore, in addition to assistance

to meet such short-term needs, assistance that would lead to a more full-fledged development of social
infrastructure was also necessary.

In view of such a situation, Japan conducted activities for humanitarian and reconstruction assistance,

dispatching GSDF units to Muthanna Province in Iraq in line with the Iraq Special Measures Law and
having ASDF units undertake airlifting of goods and materials used in humanitarian and reconstruction
assistance activities. Aid activities by the GSDF units in the Iraqi province continued for about two years and
a half in wide-ranging areas, from medical services and water supply to reconstruction of public facilities
such as schools and roads. These assistance measures along with the provision of ODA produced visible
results in the province, such as the establishment of livelihood-related infrastructure and creation of new
jobs, basically ending the stage of assistance for meeting short-term needs. Reconstruction efforts in Iraq
have now moved to the stage in which the people of Iraq should play a leading role on their own initiative.
Under such circumstances, on June 20, 2006, Japan decided to terminate the aid mission by GSDF units
of implementing response measures to meet domestic needs in Iraq. GSDF units in charge of providing
humanitarian and reconstruction assistance in Iraq returned home on July 25, 2006 and GSDF units in
charge of undertaking supplementary work accompanied by the ending of response measures arrived in
Japan on September 9 in the same year.

Meanwhile, ASDF units, acting on a request from the United Nations, will continue to undertake

activities for humanitarian and reconstruction assistance.

In order to smoothly conduct these activities, and to contribute to the stability and improvement of the

livelihood of the people of Iraq, amongst others, personnel of SDF units in charge and Japanese Government
officials tasked with undertaking reconstruction assistance in Iraq will communicate closely with each other
as well as with the overseas establishments concerned, and will collaborate on reconstruction assistance in
Iraq.

**Reference 45. Humanitarian and Reconstruction Activities etc. by the Self-Defense**

**Forces after the Restoration of Sovereignty of Iraq**

(Approved by Cabinet on June 18, 2004)

On June 8, 2004, Resolution 1546 was unanimously adopted by the United Nations Security Council. As provided
in the Resolution, the occupation of Iraq will be terminated and its sovereignty will be fully restored on June 30.

Japan welcomes the full restoration of sovereignty of Iraq and the entering into a new phase toward full

-----

fledged reconstruction.

Up until now, the Self-Defense Forces (SDF) of Japan has been carrying out activities centering on

humanitarian and reconstruction assistance activities for the people of Iraq, based on the Special Measures Law
for Humanitarian and Reconstruction Assistance in Iraq and its Basic Plan in accordance with the Constitution of
Japan. Its activities are highly appreciated in Iraq, and there is a strong expectation for the continuation of their
activities after the restoration of Iraq.

In line with the unanimously adopted UNSC Resolution, which is based on the request of the Iraq Interim

Government to the international community for assistance including the continued presence of the Multinational
Force (MNF), and with the understanding that the reconstruction and stability of Iraq is important for the security
and prosperity of Japan, the SDF will continue to carry out the above mentioned activities after the restoration
of sovereignty.

In this respect, taking into account that the new Resolution clearly defines that humanitarian and reconstruction

assistance activities, as have been carried out by the SDF, are included in the tasks of the MNF, and upon
sufficient deliberation within the Government on this matter, the Government has decided that the SDF will
continue its activities henceforth within the MNF.

Beyond June 30, the SDF will be in the MNF and under the unified command of the MNF, and it will

maintain communication and coordination between the command of the MNF. However, it will not be subject
to the command of the MNF. The SDF will continue to carry out humanitarian and reconstruction activities
etc., based on Japan’s own judgment and under the Japanese national command on the basis of the Iraq Special
Measures Law and its Basic Plan, and in a manner welcomed by the Iraq Interim Government. An understanding
was reached on this point, between the Government of Japan and the Governments of the U.S. and the U.K.,
which jointly proposed the draft Resolution, and which are core members of the MNF and its unified command.

The SDF will not be engaged in any activities that may be deemed as the use of force which is prohibited

by the Constitution. It will continue its activities in so-called “non-combat areas” in accordance with the Special
Measures Law, and its activities will not become an integral part of the use of force by other States.

As explained above, the SDF’s activities within the MNF will not alter the Government position regarding

participation in so-called multinational forces in a manner considered to be impermissible in regard to the
Constitution.

**(Reference) Humanitarian and Reconstruction Activities etc. by the Self-Defense Forces**

**after the Restoration of Sovereignty of Iraq**

(Cabinet Approval on June 28, 2004)

The sovereignty was fully restored to Iraq on June 28, 2004. Therefore, the date, “June 30” being cited as the day
to restore sovereignty to Iraq in the “Humanitarian and Reconstruction Activities etc. by the Self-Defense Forces
after the Restoration of Sovereignty of Iraq” (Cabinet Understanding of June 18, 2004) should be understood as
“June 28.”

**Reference 48. Basic Plan Concerning the Replenishment Support Activities based on**

**the Special Measures Law on Implementation of Replenishment Support**
**Activities towards the Anti-Terrorism Maritime Interdiction Operation**

(January 16, 2008)

**1. Basic Policy**
The terrorist attacks that took place in the United States on September 11, 2001 were despicable and unforgivable
acts that were committed not only against the United States but also against humankind as a whole. The threat
of terrorist attacks has not been eliminated and the war on terror still continues to exist in the international
community. The Fight Against Terrorism is one of the most important issues that the whole world including
Japan should tackle.

For six years up to November 1, 2007, Japan had undertaken response measures in line with the Special

Measures Law Concerning Measures Being Implemented by Japan in Response to Activities by Foreign
Countries to Achieve Goals Envisaged under the U.N. Charter Following Terrorist Attacks in the United States
on September 11, 2001, and Concerning Humanitarian Measures Being Implemented on the Basis of Relevant
United Nations Resolutions (Law No. 113 of 2001). The Fight Against Terrorism requires continuous international
efforts. With the recognition that it is Japan’s own problem, it is important that Japan will continuously make an
active contribution on its own initiative for the prevention and eradication of international terrorism.

Given such a recognition, Japan will undertake replenishment support activities for foreign military forces

conducting counter-terrorist maritime interdiction activities in line with the Law Concerning the Special Measures
on the Implementation of Replenishment Support Activities for Counter-Terrorism Maritime Interdiction
Activities (Law of 1 of 2008) as follows.

**2. Matters concerning Designation of Area Where Replenishment Support Activities are to be**

**Implemented**

When designating the area where replenishment support activities are to be implemented as high seas (including
the exclusive economic zone stipulated in the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea, limited to
the Indian Ocean (including the Persian Gulf, same as below) and waters they pass in operating between the
Indian Ocean and Japan’s territorial waters) and in the air above the high seas, and territory of foreign countries
(countries located in the Indian Ocean or on its seashores, or Japan’s territory, and countries where seaports are
located for calling in among those countries), the Defense Minister shall fully consider the overall situation of the
activities conducted by other countries as well as the security situation on the ground to ensure that the activities
are to be conducted in areas where no combat operations are conducted and no combat operations are expected
to be conducted throughout the period during which the activities are to be conducted there and safety is to be
ensured while activities are underway.

**3. Size and Composition of SDF Units Engaging in Replenishment Support Activities in Overseas**

**Territories, Their Equipment and Dispatch Period**
A. (A) Size and Composition

500 personnel. If unit replacement is involved, the number will be up to 1,000 personnel)

activities (except those listed in (a))
C. (C) Dispatch Period

The period between January 16, 2008 and June 30, 2008.

**4. Important Matters Concerning Procurement and Transfer to Foreign Militaries of Goods Other**

**Than Those Being Used or Having Been Used by SDF in Clerical Work and Business Projects**

In order to replenish fuel and water to vessels and rotary wing aircraft carried on vessels as replenishment support
activities, the Government of Japan procures the relevant fuel, and transfers it to other foreign military forces on
the basis of the purport of the Law.

**5. Matters Concerning Coordination and Liaison between Relevant Government Organizations for**

**Implementation of Replenishment Support Activities**

The Cabinet Secretariat takes the initiative in promoting coordination and liaison between relevant government
organizations.

**6. Other Important Matters Concerning Replenishment Support Activities**
A. (A)

Relevant government organizations closely communicate with each other to share information
obtained through execution of administrative duty which is deemed necessary for implementation
of replenishment support activities by the SDF, including overall situations of activities by foreign
military forces in areas where SDF units are to engage in such activities and their vicinity, and local
security conditions.
B. (B)

Heads of relevant government organizations cooperate with the SDF when the Defense Minister files
a request with such organizations for dispatching to SDF units which are to engage in replenishment
support activities their employees with technological expertise and ability, etc. which are deemed
necessary for implementation of the activities and for providing goods and equipment belonging to the
government organizations, as long as such cooperation does not hamper execution of their administrative
duty.
C. (C)

cooperation for the implementation of replenishment support activities acting on an order by the
Foreign Minister.

**Reference 66. The Ethos of SDF Personnel**

(Adopted on June 28, 1961)

Ours is a country with a long history and splendid tradition that has emerged from the many trials it has faced,
and is now in the process of developing as a nation based on the principles of democracy.

Its ideals are to cherish freedom and peace, encourage social welfare and contribute to a global peace that

is founded on justice and order. In order to bring about these ideals, it is essential that we ensure the continued
existence and security of a Japan that stands on the premise of democracy by protecting its peace and its
independence.

In observing the realities of the world, we find that countries are making ever greater efforts to prevent war

through international cooperation. At the same time, the development of weapons of mass destruction means
that the outbreak of large-scale war would be disastrous, and thus efforts to keep such weapons under control
are growing stronger. International disputes, however, continue unabated, with countries seeking to protect their
own peace and independence by putting in place the defense arrangements they need to serve their continued
existence and security.

While retaining the sincere hope that the wisdom of mankind and the cooperation of people of all countries will


-----

lead to a lasting world peace, the Japanese people have created the present-day SDF to protect their own country.
The mission of the SDF is to protect the peace and independence of the country and preserve its security.

The principal task of the SDF is to prevent the occurrence of direct and indirect aggression against Japan,

and to repel any such aggression should it take place.

The SDF exist as part of the nation. In accordance with the principles of democratic government, the

Commander-in-Chief of the SDF is, as such, the Prime Minister, who represents the Cabinet, and the basic
administration of the SDF is subject to control by the National Diet.

Whether in peacetime or in the event of an emergency, SDF personnel must, at all times, be prepared to

identify themselves with the people and take pride in serving the public without regard to themselves.

The spirit of SDF personnel is founded on the healthy spirit of the nation itself. Cultivation of the self, love

of others and concern for the motherland and its people —these particular attributes provide the SDF with the
proper sense of patriotism and identification with their own people that lie at their spiritual heart.

We must remember the true nature of our role as members of the SDF, and refrain from taking part in political

activities, reflect deeply on the distinguished mission bestowed on us as members of the SDF and take great pride
in our work. By the same token, we must devote ourselves unstintingly to training and self-discipline and, in the
face of events, be prepared to discharge our duties at risk to ourselves, acting on the basis of the criteria below.

**1. Awareness of Mission**
(1) We will protect from external aggression the nation of Japan, its land and people, which we have inherited

from our forefathers and which we will bequeath to the next generation enriched and developed.
(2) We will safeguard the peace and order of our national life, which is founded on freedom and responsibility.

**2. Individual Development**
(1) We will strive to make ourselves into positive and upstanding members of society who are free from

prejudice, and cultivate sound judgment.
(2) We will develop into well-balanced individuals with regard to qualities such as intellect, initiative,

trustworthiness and physical fitness.

**3. Fulfillment of Responsibility**
(1) We will go about our duties with courage and perseverance at the risk of our lives as dictated by our

responsibilities.
(2) We will be bound to our comrades by love and protect our posts steadfastly in the spirit of public service.

**4. Strict Observance of Discipline**
(1) We will be true and impartial in our observance of the law and submission to orders, in the belief that

discipline is the lifeblood of a unit.
(2) We will make sure that the orders we give are appropriate, and cultivate the habit of positive, considered

obedience.

**5. Strengthening of Solidarity**
(1) Outstanding leadership and warm comradeship will allow us to develop the confidence to endure hardship

and suffering collectively.
(2) We, the Ground, Maritime and Air Self-Defense Forces, will do all we can to respond to the responsibilities

with which we are entrusted by devoting ourselves as one to ensuring the continued existence of our country
and its people.

**Reference 77. New Measures to Promote Harmony between Defense Facilities and**

**Surrounding Communities**

|New Measures|Description of Projects|
|---|---|
|Initiative to Integrate Various Projects Undertaken in Areas Surrounded by Defense Facilities|Various livelihood-improvement projects being planned separately by municipalities in designated areas where serious problems are caused due to installation and operations of defense facilities will be integrated with certain discretion given to concerned municipalities for project implementation.|
|Subsidies for Installation of Solar Power Systems|Monitoring will be conducted to study whether it is advisable to provide subsidies to households which have installed a solar power system as part of sound-insulation work so as to reduce their financial burden of electricity charges for air-conditioning equipment which has been also installed for sound insulation.|
|Promotion of Housing-Exterior Work for Sound Insulation|In order to improve the livelihood of affected households, sound-insulation work covering the entire part of their houses will be promoted instead of room-based work as being applied previously.|
|Community-Building Support Projects|Subsidies and other support will be provided for an initiative by municipalities to promote community- building using surrounding assets (nearby airfields). Such support is meant to significantly contribute to the development of local communities as well as reducing negative effects of defense facilities to minimal levels.|
|Renovation of Existing Public Facilities|When public halls and other public facilities become unable to meet needs of local people because such facilities have become outmoded with the passage of time or the aging of the population, these facilities will be renovated using subsidies so that they are made barrier-free with their safety being enhanced.|
|Active Use of Assets Near Airfields|The state will promote the use by the general public of surrounding assets it has established and managed, such as green zones, by installing benches and rest facilities and permitting municipalities to use them. The state will also permit municipalities to use farm areas so that they are open to citizens.|
