## 1 Introduction
 In Turkey, the use of information and communication technologies (ICTs) has

 been spreading rapidly and ICTs are playing important roles in all aspects of our

 lives. In addition to public sector organizations, organizations which provide

 services in critical infrastructure sectors like energy, water resources, health,

 transportation, communication and financial services have also been heavily

 using information and communication systems. These systems improve the

 quality and the speed of the services being provided, thus helping organizations

 work more productively, contributing to the improvement of living standards. 

 As our public sector organizations use ICTs to provide services at an increased

 rate, it has become an important aspect of our national security and

 competitiveness to ensure the security of information and communication

 technologies. The vulnerabilities inherent in ICTs may cause denial of service or

 abuse of service attacks, resulting in potential loss of lives, high scale economic

 losses, disturbance of public order and/or threats to national security. 

 It is a fact that cyber space offers opportunities of anonymity and deniability for

 attacks on information systems and data. The tools and knowledge required for

 attacks are often cheap and easy to get, and it has been observed that anyone or

 any systems across the world can participate in cyber-attacks, either knowingly

 or unknowingly. And it is deemed almost impossible to determine who finances

 and organizes these enduring and advanced cyber-attacks that target the


-----

## information systems and data of critical infrastructures. These facts and

 conditions reveal the asymmetrical nature of the risks and threats in cyber space,

 making them even more difficult to tackle. 

 In light of this context, the Decision made by the Council of Ministers on the

 “Execution, Management and Coordination of National Cyber Security

 Activities” was published in the Official Gazette dated 20th October 2012,

 numbered 28447 and came into force. Pursuant to this cabinet decision;

 “In order to determine the precautions to be taken for cyber security,

 to approve - and to ensure implementation and coordination of - the

 plans, schedules, reports, procedures, principles and standards that

 have been prepared, a Cyber Security Council has been established,

 which is to be presided by the Minister of Transport, Maritime Affairs

 and Communications and which is to consist of the undersecretaries

 of the Ministries of Foreign Affairs, Interior, National Defense,

 Transport, Maritime Affairs and Communications, including the

 undersecretaries of Public Order and Security, National Intelligence

 Organization, Head of Communication, Electronic and Information

 Systems of Turkish General Staff, Head of Information And

 Communication Technologies Authority, Head of The - Scientific And

 Technological Research Council, Head of Financial Crimes

 Investigation Council, Telecommunications Communication

 Presidency and the top managers of the ministries and the public


-----

## organizations that are to be determined by the Minister of Transport,

 Maritime Affairs and Communications.”

 The cabinet decision has also assigned to the Ministry of Transport, Maritime

 Affairs and Communications the duty to prepare policies, strategies and action

 plans on ensuring cyber security at the national level. All public organizations

 and agencies, natural and legal persons, are obliged to perform the duties

 assigned in the framework of the policies, strategies and action plans determined

 by the Cyber Security Council, and to comply with the procedures, principles

 and standards that were also determined by the Council.

 The action plan which was prepared pursuant to this decision defines the

 activities intended to be carried out within the term 2013-2014, and it also

 includes the periodical activities beyond these terms as well as the activities that

 should always be carried out such as training and awareness-raising activities. 


-----

 incident.

 National Cyber Security: The cyber security of all services, processes and data

 –and the systems involved in provisioning of these- provided by the information

 and communication technologies in the national cyber space.


-----

## 1.2 Objective
 The objective of National Cyber Security Strategy and 2013-2014 Action Plan is

 to create an infrastructure towards achieving;

 - the cyber security all of services, processes and data –and the systems

 involved in provisioning of these- provided by the public organizations

 and agencies using information technologies,

 - the cyber security of information systems of critical infrastructures which

 are operated by both the public and private sectors,

 - minimization of the effects of cyber security incidents, determination of

 strategic cyber security actions to put systems back to their regular

 operational states as soon as possible following the incidents, and help

 with better investigation and prosecution of the incident by law

 enforcement and judicial authorities.

 1.3 Scope
 The National Cyber Security Strategy and 2013-2014 Action Plan includes the

 information systems of public organizations and the information systems that

 belong to critical infrastructures operated by both the public and private sectors. 

 1.4 Update
 National Cyber Security Strategy and 2013-2014 Action Plan will be updated at

 least once a year in a coordinated way at national level, taking into account the


-----

## requests from the public and private sectors, and considering also the changing

 conditions and needs. 


-----

## 2 Cyber Security Risks
 The risks related to cyber security should realistically be determined in order for

 the strategic cyber-security actions to be determined in the best way. With the

 current know-how, the primary risk elements related to ICT systems in Turkey

 are listed below;

 1. The threat is asymmetrical as cyber space provides opportunities of

 anonymity and deniability for attacks on information systems and data,

 and the tools and knowledge required for attacks are often cheap and easy

 to get, and anyone or any systems across the world can participate in

 cyber-attacks, either knowingly or unknowingly.

 2. Any information system can harm another due to the structure of the

 cyber space that is open to integrated and uninterrupted communication

 and due to the malware and other similar threat agents existing in the

 cyber space.

 3. Most of the critical services to the populations today are provided and

 managed by information systems.

 4. Most of the information systems of critical infrastructures are accessible

 through the Internet, 

 5. There is a lack of national awareness on the subject, in spite of the fact

 that cyber security at the national level can only be maintained by the

 contribution of all the citizens,


-----

## 6. Lack of coordination amongst the partner organizations at the national

 level in the field of cyber security.

 7. Attacks in cyber space to individuals or public agencies go unreported due

 to the fear of damage to reputation or due to other reasons.

 8. The lack of national and international regulations about investigation and

 prosecution of cyber security incidents makes it even more difficult to

 cooperate,

 9. The services of critical infrastructures are negatively affected not only by

 cyber-attacks but also by potential errors inherent in information systems,

 user errors or natural disasters, and there is a lack of capabilities necessary

 to take measures against these kinds of incidents, 

 10. Public organizations do not have good enough information security

 management infrastructures,

 11. Public organizations and individuals do not have sufficient level of

 information and awareness in terms of cyber security,

 12. Top managers of public organizations do not have sufficient information

 about cyber security or they do not seem to be sufficiently interested in

 the issue of cyber security,

 13. Public organizations are not sufficiently structured towards achieving

 cyber security, and the issue of cyber security is regarded as a

 responsibility of the IT departments only.


-----

## 14. The staff in IT departments do not have sufficient level of information

 and experience in the field of cyber security, 

 15. There is limited number of staff who would be competent in investigation

 and prosecution of crimes that have emerged as a result of cyber security

 violations,

 16. The auditing steps about cyber security are not included sufficiently in

 the internal audit procedures of organizations,

 17. Cyber security is not considered as an indispensable component of the

 information systems which are procured or developed, thus cyber security

 is not taken into account at sufficient level during procurement of

 products and services in the area of information and communication

 technologies in public organizations,

 18. There is not enough national manufacturing in terms of hardware and

 software.


-----

## 3 Principles
 The principles to be considered in ensuring national cyber security are as

 follows: 

 1. Cyber security should be ensured by methods which are based on risk

 management and continual improvement.

 2. For cyber security, in addition to the technical dimension, an integrated

 approach should be adopted that would involve determining strong and

 weak sides in legal, administrative, economic, political and social

 dimensions, including threats and opportunities.

 3. Risk management should be based on the elements of removing technical

 vulnerabilities, preventing attacks and threats, and minimizing the

 potential damages.

 4. It should be regarded essential that individuals, organizations, societies

 and governments should perform all their legal and social responsibilities

 towards achieving cyber security.

 5. Full cooperation with the private sector, including the participation into

 decision-making mechanisms, should be maintained for ensuring the

 security of critical infrastructures, 

 6. It is regarded as essential that cooperation should be made with the public

 and private sectors, universities and non-governmental organizations,


-----

## furthermore, international cooperation and information sharing should be

 ensured in achieving and maintaining cyber space security. 

 7. It is regarded as essential that diplomatic, technical and law enforcement

 communication channels should be used continually and effectively for

 international cooperation and information sharing.

 8. International agreements and regulations should be taken into account

 while the needed legislative actions are carried out.

 9. The principles of rule of law, fundamental human rights and freedoms and

 protection of privacy should be accepted as essential principles.

 10. Transparency, accountability, ethical values and freedom of speech

 should be supported in cyber space.

 11.A balance should be kept between security and usability.

 12. Auditing and regulatory organizations should take care of ensuring cyber

 security in areas which they are responsible for. 

 13. Use of national products and services should be encouraged in meeting

 the requirements of cyber security, and research and development projects

 should be endorsed for developing these, and the concept of innovation

 should be regarded as essential.

## 4 Strategic Cyber Security Actions
 Overcoming the threats in cyber space which have been increasing every day

 and minimizing the vulnerabilities within the national cyber space as much as

 possible are of utmost importance for progressing towards an information

 society which we have aimed to reach as a nation. Effective, high quality and

 affordable usage of information technologies by all the members of the public is

 important while evolving into an information society, but it is also very

 important to achieve cyber security during the usage of these information

 technologies. Therefore, cyber security, which is expressed as the protection of

 information systems as well as the confidentiality, integrity and accessibility of

 the information being processed by these systems, is a strategic and multi-stake
 holder issue that would affect many aspects such as peace and welfare of the

 society, the economic development and stability of the nation and the national

 security of our country which has the aim to become an information society.

 In this framework, it has been determined to perform strategic actions towards

 achieving national cyber security in the 2013-2014 term, in light of the

 principles determined above. These actions include sub-actions as required,

 which are listed in the next chapter with the scheduled deadlines and the

 responsible/relevant organizations. The strategic actions scheduled to be

 performed in the term 2013-2014 has been grouped under the following titles.


-----

## a) Regulatory measures

 In the 2013-2014 term, the government will start to implement regulatory

 measures, aiming to define the duties, powers and responsibilities of the

 public organizations and agencies and to remove the existing problems in

 achieving national cyber security. These actions will be of a nature to support

 criminal law, civil law, administrative law and the regulation of all

 procedural provisions thereto. Also, a dictionary on terms of cyber security is

 to be prepared to prevent potential conceptual confusions.

 b) Activities to help with judicial processes

 Regarding cyber-attacks, in the framework of the international legal

 requirements, the following should be determined to protect the rights of

 victims; the source of attack, attacking systems and the severity of effect on

 the end users who receive service from these systems. In order to produce

 this information, the national cyberspace should be equipped with reliable

 recording mechanisms that are compatible with the current technology.

 c) Establishing the National Cyber Incidents Response Organization

 In the short term, a Cyber Incidents Response Organization that will

 efficiently operate both nationally and internationally is to be created to

 quickly determine the threats emerging in cyber space, to develop – and to

 share- precautions for reducing or removing the effects of potential incidents
 thus public organizations and agencies will gain the capability to respond to


-----

## cyber security incidents. “The National Center for Cyber Incident Response”

 (USOM), which will be available 7/24 to respond to the threats that may

 affect the country, will be established, and sectoral "Teams for Responding to

 Cyber Incidents" (SOME) will be established which are to work under the

 coordination of the USOM. The sectoral SOMEs will respond to cyber

 incidents and they will also provide information and hold awareness raising

 activities specific to the SOMEs affiliated to themselves and to the sector

 which they are responsible for. Also other SOMEs will be established within

 public organizations and agencies which are to operate under the

 coordination of sectoral SOMEs. The USOMs and the SOMEs –while

 responding to incidents - will also act in coordination with judicial authorities

 and law enforcement agencies to provide the data that will support the

 investigation. As the national contact point, the USOM will be in close

 cooperation with the equivalent authorities of other countries and

 international organizations.

 d) Strengthening the National Cyber Security Infrastructure

 In the short and the medium term, all public organizations will have wide

 ranging infrastructure projects that will support the cyber security of public

 information systems. Activities will be held for ensuring cyber security of

 public organizations, with priority given to information systems of critical

 infrastructures. The information systems of key infrastructures, their level of

 criticality, their relations with one another and the responsible staff will be


-----

## determined. The cyber security of the information systems of critical

 infrastructures will be ensured by both technological precautions and

 administrative measures and processes. To this effect, the proficiency levels

 of all staff -on cyber security- primarily those of the top managers in public

 organizations will be increased through trainings with administrative and

 technological contents. The public organizations which do not have sufficient

 proficiency in achieving cyber security will be supported with services to be

 provided in technological and administrative aspects.

 e) Human Resources Education and Awareness Raising Activities in the

 Field of Cyber Security

 In the short and medium term, activities will be carried out to create

 proficient human resources in needed numbers in the field of cyber security.

 Regulations will be created to include the concept of cyber security into the

 curricula of primary schools, secondary schools, high schools, non-formal

 education institutions and higher education organizations. Events will be

 organized with an aim to raise awareness –on cyber security- of information

 system auditors, technology developers, system administrators and all other

 relevant parties, and to provide information that falls under their

 responsibilities. Auditing steps on cyber security in the internal audit

 processes of organizations will also be discussed. Also, an education

 platform will be created for all citizens in order to create and develop


-----

## awareness on cyber security, and initiatives serving this purpose will be

 supported.

 f) Developing National Technologies in the field of Cyber Security

 In the medium and long term, technical know-how and the potential and

 capabilities of the country on cyber security will be increased. Efforts will be

 made to have public and private sector work cooperatively in activities

 towards meeting the needs of research and development.

 g) Extending the Scope of National Cyber Security Mechanisms

 It is necessary to start working on extending the area of responsibility of our

 national security organizations, to include defense against malicious

 activities carried out in national and international cyber space.

## 5 National Cyber Security Action Plan for the Term 2013 -2014
 This chapter includes the actions towards achieving national cyber security in

 light of the determined principles for the term 2013-2014 in the framework of

 the national cyber security strategy. The actions are grouped by the titles

 determined in the fourth part of this document. One responsible public

 organization and agency is appointed for each action, however, that action can

 have more than one relevant organization and agency. In such cases, it is

 envisioned that all the relevant organizations and agencies should act under the

 coordination of the responsible organization and agency as required, and should

 also act in parallel with each other as required, to carry out the activities

 required by the action. The deadlines for some of the actions are determined,

 and those actions which are envisioned to be repeated periodically and carried

 out constantly are particularly specified. There are a total of 29 action items

 scheduled to take place in 2013-2014.
