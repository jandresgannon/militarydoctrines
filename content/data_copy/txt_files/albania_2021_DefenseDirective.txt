transnational in nature, consequently they are beyond the capabilities of individual countries,
but must be addressed through a comprehensive approach and joint actions. The strong EuroAtlantic perspective that our country has is also reflected in the Defense policy, which looks to
NATO, the EU, and partner countries for the pillars of our alliance system, to ensure the
security and defense of the country.
The situation caused by COVID-19, changed the lives of Albanian citizens, as well as the
economic perspective of the country. It is currently difficult to predict how long the emergency
situation will last, and its exact implications for economic and social stability are not yet
understood, but it is clear that we will feel its effects for a long time.
In light of these developments, the Armed Forces face ongoing efforts to address this
combination of challenges and have commenced a comprehensive transformation process while
continuing to provide the same operational levels. A transformation process based on balancing
and combining defense resources, to enable the continuous adaptation of the military
instrument, it being interoperable and operational with NATO and EU allies. This without
neglecting acquisition of skills in the direction of national efforts, in cases of extreme need and
urgency.
The several-year approach to increase attention to personnel and a more dignified treatment has
continued in areas that support the appreciation of military service and improvement of
compensation.
The reforms carried out for the transformation of Military Higher Education, fully meet the
defense needs for cadres and guarantee interoperability with the homologous military education
systems of NATO countries. This system prepares today new officers, through the educational
cycle "Bachelor", according to the format of the Bologna Charter and Process. The 3-year
program of the first cycle is currently part of the curriculum of the Faculty of Defense and
Security.
Implementation of projects, such as: Integrated Airspace Surveillance System, Integrated
Maritime Surveillance System, Military Cyber Security Unit, cooperation with NATO for the
transformation of Kuçova Air Base into a Tactical Air Base, as well as the process of turning
the Pashaliman Base into a NATO Base will have a significant impact at a national level and
within the Alliance.
The crisis caused by COVID-19, as well as the situation and damage caused by the earthquake
of November 26, 2019, showed the added value that the Defense can demonstrate in this type of
situation. The restructuring of the Civil Protection System has increased the effectiveness of
responding to civil emergencies, safety, and quality of life of citizens.
The main priorities of the work for 2021 include: the conceptual framework in the field of
security and defense, good management and development of defense resources, legal support,
capacity development, consolidation of the Civil Protection System, as well as international
cooperation. Also, the focus is on the objective of gradually increasing the defense budget to
2% of GDP, but also keeping investment and modernization expenditures at 20% of the defense
budget.
The Defense Directive 2021 best addresses the challenges to the international security
environment, supports the fulfillment of constitutional obligations, and fulfills international
obligations.
As Minister of Defense, I have full confidence that the structures of the Ministry of Defense and
the Armed Forces will best preserve what we have achieved and will successfully carry out the
tasks set, making the Armed Forces a valuable asset for our country and society.

enhancing capabilities to contribute to Alliance missions, operations and activities, as well as
missions and tasks at home, including support to civilian authorities in civil emergencies. The
development in our country of the training package "Defender Europe 21" and the active
participation of the Armed Forces in this training should be a top priority and to be used to
increase the operational and interactive capacities of the Armed Forces.

modernization, taking into account the obligations arising from the Capability Objectives
Package, maintaining the operational commitments of the Armed Forces and the objective for
their gradual reconceptualization to suit to "diversity of areas, capacities and quality".
There should be provided the necessary logistic support and required capabilities to support the

The primary task of the MoD and GS structures remains the full support for the NATO Support
and Procurement Agency, to implement the projects for modernization of the Kuçova Air Base,
for its transformation into a NATO Tactical Air Base.
There should be worked continuously to improve the infrastructure, provide the best possible
conditions for work, living, education, training, support operations, and systematization of
command and control. The MoD and GS structures should continue the work to provide
“online” services for citizens, through the governmental portal e-Albania.

support for the personnel, with priority given to the implementation of preventive measures and
possible health training against COVID-19. Of priority remains health support in operations,
general medical support, as well as capacity building for civil emergencies.
2.4. Financial resources: The defense budget should be planned in a balanced way between the
main categories of budget expenditures, aiming at capacity building, based on priorities. The
budget should be implemented in accordance with the objectives for increasing transparency
and the fight against corruption, as well as aiming to increase as much as possible the
effectiveness of spending the available funds. Of priority is to continue the support for
investment projects in the framework of modernization of the Armed Forces and international
commitments.

the operational levels planned and approved for 2020-2024, as well as the capacities declared in
the Civil Emergency Plans and the National Search and Rescue Plan.
NATO measures in the national system should be implemented, in order to respond to crisis
and Operational Planning to Engage the Armed Forces against asymmetric, hybrid, but also
conventional threats, completing the strategic and operational planning within 2021, according
to the scenarios of the Strategic Defense Review 2019.
In the framework of collective defense, there should continue the contribution to the NATO
Command and Force structures, the Enhanced Forward Presence (EFP) and the Response Force
(NRF), as well as to the current NATO, EU, the UN crisis management operations.
4.3. Interoperability: There should be increased the level of interoperability, with the aim of
successfully accomplishing engagements at the national level, as well as with NATO and EU
allies, with a special focus on the declared departments and subdivisions and those participating
in Alliance-led missions and operations. There should be improved the implementation of
ratified STANAG/Aps of the Capability Objectives Package, through their integration into the
educational, training and exercise programs of the structures.
The standardization process should support the Capability Objectives and modernization plans,
mainly selecting for ratification and implementation the STANAG/APs of the Capability
Objectives Package and those considered critical in the context of interoperability.
There should be updated the doctrines of the forces and services, aiming at achieving the
objectives in fulfillment of national interests, as well as achieving interoperability with the
Allied Forces.
**5.** **Consolidation of the Civil Protection System.**
Consolidation of the Civil Protection System should aim at disaster risk reduction, securing
people's lives, property, cultural heritage and environmental protection. In addition to the
adoption of bylaws, of priority is the functioning of NCPA, as well as the continuation of
procedures for our country's membership in the European Civil Protection Mechanism.
There should be coordinated and supported local self-government units for the implementation
of preventive and rehabilitation investments in infrastructure. There should be strengthened the
role of the National Search and Rescue Center, as the main management structure of search and
rescue operations, through increased cooperation and interaction with institutions inside and
outside the country, in accordance with the requirements of the National Search and Rescue
Plan.

network of real-time data transmission.
Planning and creation of material reserves should aim at increasing transport capacities to cope
with emergency situations, replenishing the stock of reserves, as defined by applicable laws,
increasing and improving storage capacity.
**6.International engagement and cooperation.**
6.1.International co-operation: There should continue the political support and the necessary
resources to be provided for full and sustained Alliance engagement, in the spirit of Fair Sharing
of Responsibilities (BurdenSharing).
The Ministry of Defense should remain committed to politically support the Alliance's
continued adaptation to current and future security risks and challenges. The Armed Forces
should enhance efforts to strengthen national and collective security, based on the newly
updated NATO defense and reinforcement plans, with primary attention paid to the
implementation of the Euro-Atlantic Area Defense and Deterrence Concept.
The security and defense policies should be based on the strengthening of bilateral agreements
and cooperation with close allies, both in times of peace or crisis. The defense should be based
on a wide network of multilateral and bilateral relations, consolidating solidarity and the spirit
of trust. Defense diplomacy should play an important role in this regard.
There should continue the cooperation with state actors, seizing the opportunities for
engagement in EU initiatives and participation in multilateral export control and nonproliferation regimes.
The Western Balkans region, the common approach to various risks and challenges, as well as
its promotion in the international arena, should remain a priority in bilateral and multilateral
engagements. Comprehensive und unlimited support should be offered for the transformation
of the Ministry of Defense of the Republic of Kosovo and the consolidation of its Security
Force.
6.2 Regional cooperation: There should continue the active participation and proactive approach
to OSCE forums and mechanisms in the field of defense and arms control, and there should be
pursued the support for priorities built during the 2020 presidency.
The Ministry of Defense should continue promoting cooperation, for the consolidation of
security, stability and peace in Southeast Europe. Of priority is the successful completion of the
chairmanship of the Southeast Europe Defense Ministers Secretariat. As part of the US-Adriatic
Charter initiative, close cooperation should be maintained with a view to joint operational
engagements of the Alliance. There should continue the interaction in the framework of the
meetings of the Chiefs of Defense of the Western Balkans and the Defense Cooperation
Initiative.
6.3 Contribution to international operations and initiatives: The primary objective of Defence
should be the contribution as part of engagements undertaken by Albania for safeguarding
international peace and security. We are of the opinion that the defense of Albania starts outside
our territorial borders and that the most effective approach is prevention. In this perspective, an
integral part of the overall defense efforts should be the participation of the Armed Forces in
NATO, EU, and UN operations or activities.
