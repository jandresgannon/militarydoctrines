**On the Publication of Defense of Japan 2020**

Minister of Defense
KONO Taro

Thank you very much for taking a look at the 2020 version of the Defense White Paper.

The Defense White Paper was fi rst published exactly 50 years ago, in 1970, based on

then Defense Agency Director-General NAKASONE Yasuhiro’s strong conviction that

“more than anything else, it is the understanding, active support, and cooperation of the

people that is essential to the defense of the nation,” at a time when the general public

still had a strong negative perception of the Self-Defense Forces (SDF).

Since then, as the international situation has changed dramatically and the

uncertainty over the security environment surrounding Japan has grown rapidly, the

role and the fi eld of activities of the Ministry of Defense (MOD)/SDF have broadened

to cover the space, cyberspace and electromagnetic domains.

Although dramatic changes unimaginable half a century ago have occurred,

widespread understanding and support from the Japanese people continue to be

essential in any era in order to defend their peaceful lives and Japan’s territorial land,

seas and airspace.

We believe that Mr. Nakasone’s conviction lives on in the current Defense White

Paper, which marks the 50th anniversary of publication. We are looking forward to

your reading it.

In compiling the 2020 version of the Defense White Paper, we pursued ease of

understanding and user-friendliness. Below, let me explain the notable features of the

white paper.


-----

First, in order to provide an overall picture, we summarized important international

developments and the MOD/SDF’s activities that we would like you to understand in

the Special Feature “Defense Chronology” and “Digest.” These include North Korea’s

repeated ballistic missile launches; China’s persistent continuation of the unilateral

attempt to alter the status quo; the MOD/SDF’s dedicated contributions to bringing the

outbreak of the novel coronavirus disease under control; disaster relief operations

conducted in response to large-scale natural disasters; the start of information gathering

activity in order to ensure the safety of Japan-related vessels in the Middle East; and

defense cooperation and exchange with the United States and other countries.

In addition, in the current white paper, we introduce to readers around 50 SDF

personnel, a higher number than previously, in order to convey the voices of SDF

personnel engaging in various activities inside and outside of the country with a strong

sense of mission so that you can feel more familiar with the MOD/SDF.

In addition, in a new departure, we have prepared more than 50 videos related to the

contents of the main text and placed QR codes linked to them in the main text.

As you can easily play various videos via a smartphone, we hope that you will enjoy

watching them.

We also changed the coverage period of the white paper. Previously, the white paper

covered a period of approximately one year to around June, but the period was changed

to approximately one year to the end of March, namely the end of a fiscal year. As a

result, the 2020 version of the Defense White Paper mainly covers activities and

incidents in FY2019. However, it also covers some important incidents, such as those

related to the novel coronavirus, that occurred by June this year.

Furthermore, while the Defense White Paper can be accessed through the MOD’s

website, the 2020 version for the first time contains editable data in the Reference

section at the end. I hope that this will be very useful for readers.

As indicated above, I expect that more people, including security experts and

ordinary people, will find the 2020 version of the Defense White Paper enjoyable and

satisfying to read.

I sincerely hope that by using the white paper as a convenient reference, you will

deepen your understanding of matters related to the security of Japan and activities of

the MOD/SDF.

Launches of Ballistic Missiles
by North Korea

North Korea is proceeding with ballistic missile development at
an extremely rapid pace and launched more than 30 missiles

**July 2019** and other objects, including what are presumed to be new short
range ballistic missiles and a submarine-launched ballistic
missile (SLBM) since May 2019.
These short-range ballistic missiles presumed to be new types
are distinctive in that they use solid fuel and fl y at lower altitudes
than conventional ballistic missiles. North Korea is therefore
believed to be trying to breach missile defense networks by
making it more diffi cult to detect signs of a launch and making

Short-range ballistic missiles (described by North Korea as “new type of tactical guided weapon”) early detection harder. There are concerns that such advanced

technologies will be applied to longer-range missiles.

【JANES】

North Korea is relentlessly pursuing increasingly complex and
diverse modes of attack and is steadily strengthening and
improving its attack capabilities. These enhancements in its

**August 2019**

capabilities make early detection of the signs of a launch and
the interception of the missiles more diffi cult, thereby posing
new challenges for the intelligence gathering, early warning,
and interception postures of relevant countries, including Japan.
Working closely with relevant ministries and agencies, as well
as countries including the United States, the MOD/SDF take all
possible measures to ensure Japan’s peace and security, sparing
no effort in gathering and analyzing the necessary information

Short-range ballistic missiles (described by North Korea as “new weapon” or as “tactical guided
weapon”) and undertaking warning and surveillance activities.

2020 marked the 60th anniversary of the Japan-U.S. Alliance.
“Today, more than ever, the Japan-U.S. Security Treaty is a pillar that is indestructible, a pillar
immovable, safeguarding peace in Asia, the Indo-Pacifi c, and in the world, while assuring prosperity
therein,” Prime Minister Abe said in his speech at a reception to commemorate the 60th anniversary
of the signing of the Security Treaty, which was held on January 19 at the Ministry of Foreign Affairs’
Iikura Guest House.
The Prime Minister expressed his determination to continue working to enhance the Alliance, saying,
“it is incumbent upon us to make it even more robust, to make it a pillar for safeguarding peace and
security in both outer space and cyberspace. Let us keep and enhance [the Alliance], ... to make it a
pillar safeguarding freedom, liberty, democracy, human rights and the rule of law ... sixty years, one

**New Domains**
**2**

Nowadays, various kinds of satellites have been launched for
observation, communication/broadcasting and positioning,

**Space**

making outer space key infrastructure for both the public
and private sectors in such areas as society, economics and

**Domain**

science. Also in the security area, major countries have been
making proactive efforts to use outer space for maintaining
peace and safety.
When using outer space, it is necessary to ensure its stable
use. However, there has been a rapid increase in the volume
of space debris in outer space, raising the risk of signifi cant
damage to satellite functions caused by collision between
debris and satellite. In addition, it is pointed out that the
development and verifi cation test of a killer satellite, which
approaches a target satellite to disturb, attack, and capture it,
is underway, increasing the threat to the stable use of outer
space.

Owing to the advancement of information and communications

**Cyber** technology in recent years, information and communications

networks such as the Internet have become essential

**Domain** components across all facets of life. Therefore, cyber attacks

against information and communications networks have the
potential to seriously impact the lives of individuals. Under such
circumstances, cyber attacks have frequently been carried out
against information and communications networks of not only
government organizations and military forces but also business
corporations and academic organizations in various countries.
Attacks attempting to steal critical technologies, secrets or
personal information have been confi rmed. For the MOD/
SDF, information and communications networks that leverage
cyberspace form a foundation for the SDF’s activities in various
domains, and any attack against them would seriously disrupt
the organized activities of the SDF.

In everyday life, electromagnetic spectrum is used for various

**Electromagnetic** purposes ranging from television and mobile communications

to geolocation information through global positioning systems.

**Domain** In the security area, electromagnetic spectrum has been used

for command/communication, and warning/surveillance. With
the development of the technology, its use has expanded in
range and purpose, and it is now recognized as the frontline
of the offense-defense dynamic in today’s warfare. Therefore,
ensuring superiority in electromagnetic domains such as these
is essential for realizing cross-domain operations.


-----

Cross-Domain
Operations

Contemporary warfare combines the traditional domains of land, sea, and air with new

domains such as space, cyberspace, and electromagnetic spectrum. In such situation, it is

essential to block and eliminate attacks by leveraging capabilities in such new domains as

space, cyberspace, and electromagnetic spectrum so as to effectively deter and counter

threats. Cross-domain operations that organically fuse capabilities in the new domains and

the traditional domains of land, sea, and air to exercise domain-crossing capabilities have thus

become vitally important.

Overview

**Current Trends in Security Environment**

-  Uncertainty over the existing order is increasing, and inter-state competition is becoming prominent across the political, economic and military
realms.

-  Complex measures required due to “hybrid warfare”

-  Prolonged gray-zone situations

-  Technological progress exerting signifi cant infl uence on security

-  Importance of domains of space, cyberspace, and electromagnetic spectrum

-  Game-changing technologies that could drastically change the conduct of future warfare (artifi cial intelligence (AI), hypersonic, and high-power
energy technologies, etc.)

-  Emergence of security challenges, which cannot be dealt with by a single country alone

-  Need to secure stable use of new domains: space and cyberspace; need to ensure security of maritime traffic; response to proliferation of
weap ons of mass destruction (WMDs); and response to international terrorism

-  It is necessary to keep an eye on the COVID-19 infection, which is bringing about diverse impacts and restrictions to military activities of respective
countries.

**Security Environment Surrounding Japan**

-  Military powers with high quality and quantity are concentrated in Japan’s surroundings, where clear trends such as further military buildup and an
increase in military activities are observed.

-  A regional cooperation framework in the security realm has not been suffi ciently institutionalized in the Indo-Pacifi c region and longstanding issues
of territorial rights and reunifi cation continue to remain.

-  Recent years have seen a continued tendency towards the prolongation of “gray zone” situations that are associated with territories, sovereignty and
economic interests, and such situations may increase and expand in the future.

**Overview**

- The United States recognizes strategic competition with revisionist powers, namely China and Russia, as the central challenge to U.S. security.
Especially, the United States ranks China at the top of its list of priorities and places the greatest emphasis on the security of the Indo-Pacifi c
region to strengthen deterrence against China.

extraordinary threat to the United States, it has maintained sanctions and continues to pursue denuclearization of North Korea, while maintaining
strong military readiness of the U.S. forces including U.S. Forces Korea.

-  The United States prioritizes the allocation of military forces to the Indo-Pacifi c region and Europe while reducing forces in the Middle East and
Africa. The United States, however, still needs to deal with security issues in the latter regions, which makes it difficult to describe that such
transition of the U.S. force posture is smoothly progressing.

-  The United States has indicated that certain allies, which are pointed out as bearing a small
burden, should bear it appropriately. It has requested NATO member states to swiftly achieve
their national defense spending goals, and has required the Republic of Korea (ROK) to
shoulder a bigger share of the costs associated with U.S. Forces Korea.

-  Amid rising tensions between Iran, the U.S. military killed the commander of the Quds
Force of Iran’s Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps in Iraq. In response, Iran launched
ballistic missiles towards Iraq bases where U.S. Forces were stationed.

-  Against growing tensions in the Middle East, the U.S. military reinforced its posture in the
region. Additionally, the United States established the International Maritime Security
Construct (IMSC) and conducted activities by naval vessels and other equipment, along President Trump announcing the Iranian ballistic missile attack in Iraq [U.S. DoD]
with countries including the United Kingdom.

**Trends in Security and Defense Policies**

-  Based on the Nuclear Posture Review (NPR) released in February 2018, the United States modifi ed a portion of its existing SLBM warheads into lowyield warheads. Additionally, the United States conducted test launches of its intermediate-range ground-launched cruise missile and ballistic missile,
which had been restricted by the Intermediate-Range Nuclear Forces (INF) Treaty. It also mentioned the necessity for arms control that includes China,
which has beefed up medium-range missile capabilities outside the scope of the INF Treaty.

-  The United States founded the Space Command as a Unifi ed Combatant Command and then established
the Space Force as the sixth branch of its military, within the Department of the Air Force (a new military
service established for the fi rst time in 70 years after the establishment of the Air Force).

**Rapid Military Modernization**

-  In order to fully transform the people’s armed forces into world-class forces by the mid-21st century, China has sustained high-level growth of its
defense budget without transparency, engaging in broad, rapid improvement of its military power in qualitative and quantitative terms with focus on
nuclear, missile, naval and air forces. In doing so, it has attached importance to strengthening its operational capabilities in order to steadily acquire
information superiority, and also enhanced its capabilities in the domains of space, cyberspace and electromagnetic spectrum.

-  Bolstering these capabilities will reinforce China’s “Anti-Access/Area-Denial (A2/AD)” capabilities and lead to the establishment of operational
capabilities further afield.

-  While implementing a policy of civil-military fusion across the board, with the aim of promoting two-way links between military and civilian resources
in various fields, China is striving to develop and acquire cutting-edge technologies that can be used for military purposes, and improve its operational
capabilities.

-  Chinese forces’ efforts to use artifi cial intelligence (AI) technology under the awareness that "intelligent warfare is on the horizon"

**Activities in the Surrounding Sea Area and Airspace of Japan**



-  China has relentlessly continued unilateral attempts to change the
status quo by coercion in the sea area around the Senkaku
Islands, leading to a grave matter of concern.

-  The Chinese Navy and Air Force have in recent years expanded
and intensifi ed their activities in the surrounding sea areas and
airspace of Japan, and there are cases involving the one-sided
escalation of activities.

-  China is believed to be aiming to build up capabilities for
operations in more distant waters and airspace, including those to
project armed forces to waters including the so-called second
island chain, beyond the fi rst island chain.

-  China has been continuing activities viewed as training of maritime
and air forces making forays into the Pacifi c and the Sea of Japan,
being suspected of intending to regularize these activities.

-  In the South China Sea, China is moving forward with militarization,
as well as expanding and intensifying its activities in the maritime
and aerial domains, thereby continuing unilateral attempts to
change the status quo by coercion to create a fait accompli.

**Activities in Further Distant Seas**



-  China is steadily increasing its capabilities to conduct operations in more distant seas such as the Indian Ocean in recent years.

-  China has been promoting its “Belt and Road” Initiative, and China’s support for the construction of port infrastructure in Indian Ocean countries as
well as Pacifi c island countries could lead China to secure bases available for its military purpose. The Chinese military is possibly taking on the role
of the shield behind the initiative by such means as the stabilization of areas via counter-piracy activities and the improvement of counter-terrorism
capabilities in coastal states through joint exercises.

**Relations with Countries and Regions**

-  There are various issues between the United States and China, such as trade issues, issues concerning the South China Sea, the Taiwan issue, the
Hong Kong issue, and human rights issues regarding Uighur and Tibet.

-  While the United States has been toughening its stance on China, China has maintained an uncompromising
stance on its “core interests.” Concerning trade and military issues, mutually keep themselves in check
between the United States and China.

-  While the United States has continued and reinforced its engagement in Taiwan, China has repeatedly expressed
its strong protest against Taiwan’s independence.

-  Taiwanese President Tsai Ing-wen was reelected with the highest-ever number of votes and has reiterated her
opposition to the “One country, Two Systems” principle, which China keeps in check.

-  The Solomon Islands and Kiribati established diplomatic relations with China, and as a result, the number of
countries having diplomatic relations with Taiwan declined to 15 from 22 in May 2016, when President Tsai
took offi ce.

-  The overall military balance between China and Taiwan is shifting in favor of China, and the gap appears to be
growing year by year. The United States continues selling arms (such as F-16 fi ghters) to Taiwan under the
Taiwan Relations Act.

-  Moves to review projects have been seen among some countries cooperating in the “Belt and Road” Initiative, Taiwanese President Tsai Ing-wen and
due to such factors as their deteriorating financial situation. Director Brent Christensen, American

North Korea


**Overview**

-  North Korea has conducted six nuclear tests so far, and is assessed to have already miniaturized
nuclear weapons to fi t ballistic missile warheads. In addition, North Korea repeatedly launches ballistic
missiles in recent years at an unprecedented frequency, aiming to promote the development of
weapons of mass destruction (WMDs) and ballistic missiles and the enhancement of its operation
capabilities. Such military trends in North Korea pose grave and imminent threats to Japan’s security.

-  At the U.S.-North Korea summit meeting held in June 2018, Chairman Kim expressed his intention to
work towards the complete denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula, but the second U.S.-North Korea
summit meeting in February 2019 ended without any agreement being reached between the two
countries.

-  At the December 2019 Plenary Meeting of the Central Committee of the KWP, Chairman Kim announced
the intention to continue developing strategic weapons until the United States rolls back its hostile
policy towards North Korea.

**Current Status of the Nuclear Development**


Nodong missile [Korean News Service/Jiji]



-  The possibility cannot be discounted that the sixth nuclear weapons test in September 2017 was of a hydrogen bomb.

-  Given the technological maturity obtained through the past six nuclear tests, it is assessed that North Korea has already miniaturized nuclear
weapons to fi t ballistic missile warheads.

**Current Status of the Missile Development**

-  Since 2016, North Korea has launched more than 70 ballistic missiles and others, and the following characteristics have been observed: (i) increase
the firing range of ballistic missiles; (ii) enhance the accuracy, continuous fi re
capability, and operational capabilities necessary for saturation attacks; (iii)
improve its ability to conduct surprise attacks; (iv) develop ballistic missiles that
fl y at low altitudes on irregular trajectories; and (v) diversify the forms of
launches.

-  In particular, North Korea has developed more advanced missile-related
technologies in recent years. The three types of new short-range ballistic missiles
that have been involved in a series of launches since May 2019 are distinctive in
that they use solid fuel and fl y at lower altitudes than conventional ballistic
missiles. North Korea is thus believed to be trying to breach missile defense
networks, and there are concerns that such advanced technologies will be
applied to longer-range missiles.

-  North Korea is relentlessly pursuing increasingly complex and diverse modes of
attack and is steadily strengthening and improving its attack capabilities. These
enhancements in its capabilities make early detection of the signs of a launch
and the interception of the missiles more diffi cult, thereby posing new challenges North Korea when it launched
for the information gathering, early warning, and interception postures of relevant short-range ballistic missiles
countries, including Japan. (July 2019) [JANES]

**Current Status of Ship-to-Ship Transfer, etc.**

-  North Korea is presumed to be evading the UN Security Council sanctions by conducting ship-to-ship transfers on the high seas and other techniques,
and it is pointed out that in 2019, North Korea illicitly imported a volume of petroleum products far in excess of the cap set by UN Security Council
resolutions.

Russia


**Overview**

-  Russia is modernizing its military equipment, including strategic nuclear
forces, and is stepping up military activities, so close scrutiny of
developments in this regard will be required.

-  Regarding conventional forces, Russia is developing fi fth generation
fi ghters and heavy unmanned combat aerial vehicles, and is also stepping
up its activities in the realms of space and electromagnetic spectrum.

**Advancement in the Military Cooperation with China**

-  In July 2019, two Russian Tu-95 long-range bombers carried out joint air
patrol with two Chinese H-6 bombers from the Sea of Japan to the East
China Sea.

-  In September 2019, Russian Minister of Defence Shoigu and, Vice
Chairman of the Chinese Central Military Commission Zhang, signed a
package of documents on military and military-technical cooperation.

-  The authorities of both countries clearly denied that they would form a
military alliance, but attention should be paid to future developments in
light of recent advancement in their military cooperation.

**Activities in Japan’s Northern Territories and the Vicinity of Japan**

-  Russia continues to station AFRF in the Northern Territories, which are
inherent territories of Japan, and has recently been increasing the AFRF’s
activities.

-  In June 2019, two Tu-95 long-range bombers fl ew around Japan, and
intruded into Japan’s territorial airspace twice when they fl ew northward
over the Pacifi c Ocean. In July, one Russian A-50 early warning and
control aircraft intruded into Japan’s airspace above the territorial waters
of Takeshima Island. In February 2020, two Su-34 fi ghter-bombers Su-34 fi ghter-bomber
deployed to the Far East were observed for the fi rst time.

-  In October 2019, the Eastern Military District announced that drills to repel landings by a hypothetical enemy assault force were to be held in the
Sakhalin and Primorsky regions, involving up to 8,000 personnel, more than 3,000 units of tanks and military equipment, and up to 50 planes and
helicopters.

-  Even amid the spread of the COVID 19 pandemic within the forces military activities have remained active

Middle East, North Africa, and Other Regions


**Overview**

-  The Middle East is a major source of energy supply for the world and contains major routes for international commerce. Japan is also dependent
on the region for approximately 90% of its crude oil imports. Peace and stability in the Middle East region is extremely important for the peace and
prosperity of the international community, including Japan.

-  On the other hand, the Middle East and Africa region has been experiencing constant confl icts and unrest throughout the 20th century. In recent years,
tensions have risen due to the situation in the Gulf region and the Middle East peace process.

-  In some countries that experienced the Arab Spring, which occurred at the beginning of 2011, civil wars and the activities of terrorist organizations
are ongoing.

**Situation in the Gulf Region**

-  Opposing the resumption of sanctions by the United States, Iran has implemented its measures to reduce compliance with the Joint Comprehensive
Plan of Action (JCPOA) by stages since May 2019. The United Kingdom, France and Germany referred the developments to the JCPOA Joint
Commission under the JCPOA Dispute Resolution Mechanism. In response, Iran suggested the possibility of considering withdrawal from the NPT, but
stated that if Europe observes the agreement, it would return to compliance with the agreement.

-  Since May 2019, the United States has expanded the number of U.S. troops deployed to the Middle East in response to Iran’s threats. On the other
hand, since October 2019, there have been multiple attacks on U.S. military bases in Iraq and one American was victimized, which triggered military
retaliation between the United States and Iran. However, both countries clearly showed their intent to avoid further escalation.

-  Since May 2019, sporadic events affecting the navigation safety of civilian vessels have occurred in the waters of the Middle East. The United States
and other countries including European countries promote efforts to safeguard maritime security in the region.

-  The United States advocated the Maritime Security Initiative and subsequently established the International Maritime Security Construct (IMSC),
in which seven countries, including the United Kingdom, Australia, Saudi Arabia, the UAE, and Bahrain, participate, in addition to the United States.

-  Eight European countries, including France, Denmark, and the Netherlands, issued a statement to politically support the creation of a European-led
maritime surveillance mission in the Strait of Hormuz (EMASOH).

-  Iran also presented a plan named HOPE (Hormuz Peace Endeavor) as an independent effort to maintain maritime security. In addition, Iran conducted
the Maritime Safety Belt, the fi rst trilateral military exercise with the Chinese and Russian navies in the Gulf of Oman and other areas.

**Chapter** Trends Concerning New Domains and
**3** Relevant Challenges Facing the International Community


**Military Science and Technology**



-  As civilian technologies have been rapidly developing, further technological innovation is expected to dramatically change battle
scenes in the future.

-  It has been pointed out that the rapid AI progress has been exerting a great impact on the military fi eld, including the application
for autonomous unmanned vehicles and the cyber domain, in addition to the improvement in data processing capacity.

-  The United States indicates that China and Russia are developing advanced hypersonic weapons that challenge existing missile
defense systems.

-  High-power energy weapons, such as electromagnetic railguns, high-power laser weapons, and high-power microwaves, are
being expected as a means to counter various airborne threats.

**Space Domain**

-  Major countries make efforts to enhance the capabilities of a variety of satellites and launch them for the purpose of enhancing C4ISR
(command, control, communication, computer, intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance) functions.

-  In outer space, various countries are promoting use thereof in order to maintain their own peace and
security. It has also been noted that China and Russia have been enhancing capabilities to impede the Long March 5, which China
United States and its allies from using outer space. successfully launched in December

-  In order to respond to these threats, countries are restructuring space-related organizations within their 2019 [Avalon/Jiji Press Photo]
forces.

**Cyber Domain**



-  Information and communications technology (ICT) advancements are further increasing the dependence of military forces on information and communications networks.
For this reason, cyber attacks are recognized as an asymmetrical means to impede the military activities of adversaries at low cost. Many foreign military forces are
developing offensive capabilities in cyberspace.

-  It has been pointed out that China and Russia are bolstering the offensive cyber capabilities of their militaries for the purpose of obstructing the network of adversaries’
military forces and destroying their infrastructure.

-  Cyber attacks have frequently been carried out against information and communications networks of not only government organizations and military forces but also
business corporations and academic organizations in various countries. Attacks attempting to steal critical technologies, secrets or personal information have also been
confi rmed.

**Electromagnetic Domain**

-  Securing use of the electromagnetic spectrum is indispensable for the operation of communication equipment and radar
systems. Major countries recognize electronic attacks for interrupting adversaries’ use of electromagnetic spectrum as an
asymmetrical means to effectively hamper adversaries’ military performance, enhancing electronic warfare capabilities.

-  China regularly conducts force-on-force exercises to effectively accomplish missions in complicated electromagnetic
environments, thereby improving practical capabilities.

-  It is reported that Russia used various electronic warfare systems in eastern Ukraine
and Syria to interrupt adversaries’ command and control traffic and radar systems,

LMADIS, which allegedly shot down an

**COVID-19 Infection**



-  The COVID-19 infection poses not only sanitary problems but exerts infl uence broadly on society and economy of respective countries, revealing the vulnerability of
supply chains and causing serious damage on local economies and concerns over prolonged economic sluggishness worldwide.

-  Respective countries are utilizing their military forces' sanitary capabilities and transportation capacity to deal with the infection domestically, and have also been
contributing to the prevention of global spread of the infection. In the meantime, military training or bilateral/multilateral exercises have been suspended or postponed,
and the infection has brought about diverse impacts and restrictions to military activities as well. If the spread of infection is
further prolonged, this may exert various impacts on countries' military capability.

-  It is said that while actively providing medical goods and dispatching medical experts to countries where the infection is
spreading, China has been making propaganda efforts in various manners, including the spread of disinformation, amid growing
social uncertainties and confusion due to the spread of infection.

-  The COVID-19 pandemic may expose and intensify strategic competition among countries intending to create international and
regional orders more preferable to themselves and to expand their infl uence. We need to closely watch such moves with great
concern as security issues.

The following are set forth as national defense objectives:

-  to create, on a steady-state basis, a security environment desirable for Japan by integrating and drawing on the strengths at the nation’s disposal;

-  to deter threats from reaching Japan by making opponents realize that doing harm to Japan would be diffi cult and consequential; and

-  should a threat reach Japan, to squarely counter the threat and minimize damage.

Under the basic precept of maintaining an exclusively defense-oriented policy, Japan will strengthen each of the means by which to successfully achieve
these national defense objectives: Japan’s own architecture for national defense; the Japan-U.S. Alliance; and international security cooperation.

**Priorities in Strengthening Defense Capability**


In order to adapt to increasingly rapid changes in the security environment, Japan will enhance priority capability areas as early as possible.

-  Strengthening Capabilities Necessary for Cross-Domain Operations

-  Strengthening capabilities in the new domains of space, cyberspace and electromagnetic spectrum

-  Strengthening capabilities in the traditional domains, such as capabilities in maritime and air domains, stand-off defense capability, comprehensive
air and missile defense capability, and maneuver and deployment capability

-  Strengthening sustainability and resiliency by promoting necessary measures for securing ammunition and fuel, ensuring maritime shipping lanes,
and protecting important infrastructure.

-  Strengthening core elements comprising defense capability

-  Strengthening core elements of defense capability by reinforcing the human resource base, technology base, and defense industrial base,
reviewing equipment structure, etc.

**Organization of Self-Defense Forces (SDF)**


-  Joint Operation to Realize Cross-Domain Operations

-  The SDF will establish new units in the domains of space, cyberspace and electromagnetic spectrum, strengthen its posture, build comprehensive
air and missile defense capability, and maintain a maritime transport unit as an integrated unit.

-  Ground Self-Defense Force (GSDF)

-  The GSDF will maintain rapidly deployable basic operational units furnished with advanced mobility and intelligence, surveillance, and
reconnaissance (ISR) capabilities, and mobile operating units equipped with specialized functions. The GSDF will strengthen its ability to deter and
counter threats by taking measures including persistent steady-state maneuvers.

-  To be able to counter an invasion of remote islands, the GSDF will maintain surface-to-ship guided missile units and hyper-velocity gliding
projectile units for remote island defense.

-  Maritime Self-Defense Force (MSDF)

-  The MSDF will maintain reinforced destroyer units including a new type of destroyers (FFM), minesweeper units, and embarked patrol helicopter
units, and will organize surface units. The MSDF will establish patrol ship units to enable enhanced steady-state ISR in the waters around Japan.

-  In order to conduct underwater ISR, and to engage in patrols and defense in the waters around Japan, the MSDF will maintain reinforced
submarine units.

-  In order to conduct wide-area airborne ISR, and to effectively engage in patrols and defense in the waters around Japan, the MSDF will maintain
fi xed-wing patrol aircraft units.

-  Air Self-Defense Force (ASDF)

-  The ASDF will maintain ground-based warning and control units capable of conducting sustained surveillance in the airspace around Japan, and
air warning and control units capable of conducting airborne warning, surveillance and control also during situations with heightened tensions,
such as “gray-zone” situations.

-  The ASDF will maintain fi ghter aircraft units reinforced by high-performance fi ghter aircraft, and aerial refueling and transport units.

-  The ASDF will maintain unmanned aerial vehicle units which enable it to conduct information collection in areas remote from Japan and persistent
airborne monitoring during situations with heightened tensions.

**Medium Term Defense Program (FY2019–FY2023; MTDP)**

-  The MTDP sets forth the policy for the build-up of defense capability, and main projects for the fi ve-year period from FY2019 to FY2023.

-  In order to build a structure that is capable of realizing cross-domain operations, the SDF will conduct reorganization of its major units.

-  The SDF will conduct programs to strengthen capabilities in both new and traditional domains.

-  The SDF will conduct programs to strengthen core elements of defense capabilities, including reinforcement of the human resource base.

-  Approximately 70% of USFJ facilities and areas (for exclusive use) are concentrated in
Okinawa Prefecture, occupying approximately 8% of the land area of the prefecture
and approximately 14% of the main island of Okinawa. Therefore, it is necessary to
make utmost efforts to mitigate the impact on Okinawa, while also considering the
above-mentioned security standpoints.

-  Regarding distribution of functions offered by MCAS Futenma, the development of
facilities is being promoted to transfer the function of accepting transient aircraft in
contingencies to Tsuiki Air Base and Nyutabaru Air Base.

-  For the construction of the Futenma Replacement Facility, the land-fi ll operation has
been carried out in the waters south of Camp Schwab. In April 2020, the Okinawa
Defense Bureau submitted to Okinawa Prefecture an application for change of land-fi ll
work related to addition of the work to improve the soil foundation, etc., based on the
Act on Reclamation of Publicly-owned Water Surface.

-  The following progress has been made involving the return of USFJ land:

March 2015: West Futenma Housing Area within Camp Zukeran (Camp Foster) US Marine Corps MV-22 Osprey fl ew to the Kokubudai maneuver Area,
(approximately 51 ha) was returned. Kagawa Prefecture, for exercise (December 2019)

December 2016: A major portion of the Northern Training Area (approximately 4,000
ha) was returned. This is the largest of its kind since the reversion of Okinawa to the mainland.

July 2017: A portion of MCAS Futenma (approximately 4 ha along Ginowan City road 11) was returned.

March 2018: A portion of Makiminato Service Area (Camp Kinser) (approximately 3 ha of land to expand Route 58) was returned.

March 2019: A portion of Makiminato Service Area (Camp Kinser) (approximately 2 ha of land near Gate 5) was returned.

March 2020: Portions of land at Camp Zukeran (Warehouse Area of Facilities and Engineering Compound) (approximately 11 ha) were returned.

**Stationing of the U.S. Forces in Regions Other than Okinawa**


-  In regions other than Okinawa, the MOD is implementing measures to secure the stable stationing of the U.S. Forces by maintaining its deterrence
and trying to mitigate the impact on local communities, such as realignment of USFJ and its facilities and areas.

**Promotion of Multilateral Security Cooperation**


-  Multilateral framework initiatives, such as the ASEAN Defence Ministers’ Meeting (ADMM)Plus and the ASEAN Regional Forum (ARF) have made steady progress and served as an
important foundation for dialogue and cooperation and exchanges on the security of AsiaPacifi c. Based on Vientiane Vision 2.0, a guideline for future ASEAN-Japan defense cooperation,
in addition to bilateral cooperation, Japan has strengthened cooperation under multilateral
frameworks.

-  Japan has contributed to the enhancement of multilateral cooperation in the region by holding
the Japan-ASEAN Defense Vice-Ministerial Forum and the Tokyo Defense Forum annually.

-  Moreover, Japan has proactively participated in international conferences hosted by
international organizations and private organizations, as well as service-to-service exchange
initiatives.

**Proactive and Strategic Initiatives for Capacity Building**


-  Since 2012, the MOD/SDF has provided capacity building in such areas as HA/DR,
peacekeeping operations (PKO), and maritime security to 15 countries and one organization
in the Asia-Pacifi c and other regions.

-  In 2019, the number of capacity building programs conducted by means of dispatch was 126
(11 countries, 20 offi cials), and the number of those conducted by means of invitation was 75
(four countries, one organization and six trainees).

-  Specifi cally, from September to October 2019, Japan has provided guidance on techniques to
PNG Military Band, which participated in the Royal Edinburgh Military Tattoo in Australia,
hosted by the United Kingdom. In addition, Japan implemented programs in Laos, Mongolia,
Cambodia, the Philippines, Sri Lanka, Malaysia, Myanmar, Djibouti and other countries.

**Ensuring Maritime Security**

-  For Japan, a maritime nation, strengthening the order based on fundamental norms, such as
the rule of law and the freedom of navigation, as well as ensuring safe maritime transport, is
the foundation for its peace and prosperity, which is extremely important.

-  The SDF has been dispatching the Deployment Surface Force for Counter Piracy Enforcement,
the Deployment Air Force for Counter Piracy Enforcement, and the Deployment Support Group
for Counter Piracy Enforcement since 2009 in order to protect vessels from acts of piracy in
the waters off the coast of Somalia and in the Gulf of Aden.

-  In addition to strengthening cooperation with coastal states of the Indo-Pacifi c region through
exercises and port calls, the MOD has been implementing capacity building in maritime
security of coastal countries, and working on cooperation for maritime security within regional
security dialogue frameworks such as the ADMM-Plus.

**Cooperation in Use of Space and Cyber Domains**

**Initiatives for Arms Control, Disarmament and Non-Proliferation**

-  The proliferation of WMDs and missiles that can deliver them, as well as the proliferation of not only
conventional arms but also goods and sensitive technologies of potential military use, pose a pressing
challenge to the peace and stability of the international community. International discussions related to
Lethal Autonomous Weapons Systems (LAWS) are also under way.

-  Since April 2018 the MOD/SDF has been sending a personnel as a member of the Group of Experts of the
1540 Committee established pursuant to the UN Security Council Resolution 1540 (adopted in April 2004)
to prevent the proliferation of WMDs and their means of delivery to non-state actors.

**Efforts to Support International Peace Cooperation Activities**

The MOD/SDF has been proactively undertaking international peace cooperation activities working in tandem
with diplomatic initiatives, including the use of ODA for resolving the fundamental causes of confl icts, terrorism
and other problems.

**Dispatch to the Multinational Force and Observers (MFO)**


-  In April 2019, the Government of Japan decided to dispatch staff offi cers, and later two staff offi cers were
dispatched to the MFO headquarters as the fi rst “Internationally Coordinated Operations for Peace and
Security.”

-  The dispatched offi cers engage in liaison and coordination between Egypt and Israel, and the MFO as a
Deputy Chief of Liaison and an Assistant Liaison Operation Offi cer at the MFO headquarters, which is
located in the south camp at Sharm El-Sheikh in the southern part of the Sinai Peninsula.

**Dispatch to the United Nations Mission in the Republic of South Sudan**

**(UNMISS)**


-  The peace and stability of South Sudan is not only essential for the country itself; but also for the peace
and stability in Africa as a whole, as well as a crucial issue that should be dealt with by the international
community.

-  Japan currently dispatches four offi cers (logistics, information database, engineering, and aviation
operations offi cers) to the UNMISS headquarters.

-  The UNTPP was founded using funds from Japan as a project to support training for military engineers
and the procurement of heavy equipment by the UN DOS. Japan has been dispatching a total of 164
GSDF personnel to Africa to provide nine training sessions for a total of 277 members from eight African
countries.

-  Considering that 30% or more of PKO personnel are from Asia, Japan has been implementing the projects
in Asia and the surrounding regions.

-  In addition, given that strengthening sanitation capacity to ensure the safety of deployed personnel has
become an issue in UN peacekeeping operations, medical training was implemented in October 2019

**International Disaster Relief Activities**


-  To contribute to the advancement of international cooperation, the SDF has engaged in international
disaster relief activities proactively from the viewpoint of humanitarian contributions and improvement of
the global security environment.

-  In recent years, international disaster relief activities were carried out from November to December 2019
in response to the heavy rains and fl oods in the republic of Djibouti and from January to February 2020
in response to the major bush fi res in Australia.

crew system was introduced in some MSDF vessels, where some crews take shifts to increase the number of operation days. The introduction of this crew
system to new types of destroyers (FFM) is being considered.

**Improvement of Living and Work Environment and Treatment**

The SDF will steadily renew aged everyday life/workplace fi xtures, secure the necessary quantities of everyday necessities in addition to accelerating the
securing and reconstruction of the necessary barracks and housing, and proceed with measures against aging and earthquake proofi ng of facilities.

In addition, the SDF will improve their treatment based on the special nature of their missions and work environment. Specifi cally, in order to ensure
appropriate treatment in accordance with the risk and special nature of their missions and the characteristics of the area of the offi ce, the SDF will make
improvements to special work allowance, etc. and procure portable beds and better emergency rations to improve their ability to respond to disasters.

**Further Promotion of Work-Life Balance and Women’s Participation**

**Working Style Reform**

The MOD/SDF is promoting correction of long working hours and encouraging taking leave to ensure proper work-life balance so that every member can
exert his/her full potential.

**Women’s Participation**

In terms of employing and promoting female SDF personnel, the MOD/SDF sets out a personnel management policy to ensure equal opportunity between

men and women and assign the right person to the right place based on the person’s motivation and ability/aptitude. In December 2019, a woman
assumed the role of commanding offi cer of an Aegis destroyer for the fi rst time, promoting active
participation of female SDF personnel. In addition, the MOD/SDF has been reviewing the restriction of
assignment of female personnel. With the removal of the restriction on female assignments in submarines
in December 2018, assignment restriction against females was completely removed with the exception of
the units where female personnel cannot be assigned for reasons of maternity protection (a part of the
GSDF Nuclear Biological Chemical (NBC) Weapon Defense Unit [chemical] and Tunnel Company Units).

Captain Otani was appointed as the fi rst female
commanding officer of an Aegis destroyer (December 2019)

Measures on Defense Equipment and Technology

**Reinforcing Technology Base**

-  Review of the Medium- to Long-Term Defense Technology Outlook is now underway in order to ensure
Japan’s technological superiority in the strategically important equipment and technology fi eld, including
technologies pertaining to new domains and other potentially game-changing important technologies.

-  As for development of the fi ghter (F-X), improving technological reliability and reducing the development
cost, the MOD is pursuing the best approach to realize Japan led development with international
cooperation in sight.

The fi ghter (F-X) (image)


**Optimizing Equipment Procurement**

-  The MOD has been promoting effective and effi cient equipment acquisition by selecting 18 items for major programs designated for project
management. At the same time, the MOD strives to cut equipment procurement costs by making bulk orders utilizing long-term contracts.

-  To enhance the level of performance management, the MOD makes every effort. The specifi c efforts include constant monitoring of goods and service
deliveries from both sides, facilitating the internal management system concerning the execution process of FMS procurement, and strengthening
cooperation with the U.S. government through close Japan-U.S. consultations.

**Strengthening Defense Industrial Base**

-  In order to strengthen Japan’s defense industrial base, the MOD identifi es four lines of effort: (1) reforming the existing contract system towards
creating a competitive environment among defense companies; (2) strengthening risk management of supply chain for defense equipment; (3)
further participation of Japan’s defense industry in sustainment and maintenance of imported equipment, etc.; and (4) promoting appropriate
overseas transfer of defense equipment under the Three Principles on Transfer of Defense Equipment and Technology.

**Defense Equipment and Technology Cooperation**

-  Based on the Three Principles on Transfer of Defense Equipment and Technology, Japan promotes cooperation in defense equipment and technology
with other countries in order to contribute to the maintenance and strengthening of technological and industrial bases, as well as contributing to the
promotion of our national security, peace and international cooperation.

-  Transfer of parts and maintenance equipment of the UH-1H utility
helicopters to the Philippines started in March 2019, and was
completed in September 2019.

-  From the viewpoint of promoting defense equipment and technology
cooperation, the ATLA has participated in international defense
equipment exhibitions. Moreover, the Public-Private Defense
Industry Forum was held with the Philippines and other countries.

Enhancing Intelligence Capabilities



-  For formulating defense policy accurately in response to the changes in the
situation and for operating defense capabilities effectively in dealing with various
situations, it is necessary to grasp medium- to long-term military trends in the
neighboring countries of Japan and to detect the indications of various situations
promptly. To this end, the MOD/SDF is making efforts to collect information
swiftly and accurately daily by using various methods.

Examples of intelligence collection means used by the MOD/SDF include: (1)
collecting, processing and analyzing military communications and signals
emanating from electronic weapons in the air over Japan; (2) collecting,
processing, and analyzing data from various imagery satellites (including
Information Gathering Satellite); (3) surveillance activities by ships, aircraft and
other assets; (4) collecting and organizing a variety of open source information;
(5) information exchanges with defense organizations of other nations; and (6)
intelligence collection conducted by defense attachés and other offi cials.

Elements that Sustain Defense Capability

**SDF Training**


Training and exercise conducted by units in each service can be broadly divided into
training for individual SDF personnel to improve the necessary profi ciency for their
respective fi elds, and training and exercise for units to enhance their systematic
capabilities. Training for individuals is conducted one-on-one in stages based on
occupational specialties and individual ability. Training and exercise for units is
conducted depending on the size of unit, from small to large; meanwhile, large-scale
comprehensive training including coordination between units is also conducted.

In order to effectively respond to various contingencies and enhance its deterrence
effectiveness, based on the NDPG and MTDP, SDF’s joint training and exercises and
Japan-U.S. bilateral training and exercises are to be conducted in a tailored and
visible way. While leveraging the lessons learned from these training and exercises,
the SDF is conducting regular studies and reviews of its plans to address contingencies.

**Enhancement of Medical Functions** Newly joined members of the SDF conducting basic training

**Enhancement of Medical Functions**

For the SDF to perform its mission, SDF personnel must remain in good health through appropriate health management. Also, it is important for the SDF
to make continued efforts to enhance and strengthen its capabilities in military medicine for maximally protecting the lives of the personnel who respond
to a variety of services.

Under the circumstances where the SDF’s missions are becoming more diverse and internationalized, it is important to appropriately and accurately carry
out various medical activities, such as medical support in disaster relief and international peace keeping activities, and capacity building in the medical
fi eld.

Efforts of the MOD/SDF in response to the spread of COVID-19, the SDF hospitals and the National Defense Medical College Hospital (NDMCH) have been
accepting COVID-19 patients since February 1, 2020. As of May 31, the SDF Central Hospital, the SDF hospitals in Sapporo, Yokosuka, Hanshin, Fukuoka,
and Kumamoto, and the NDMCH accepted 430 COVID-19 patients.

**Measures to Promote Harmony between Defense Facilities and Surrounding Areas**


In order to promote harmony between defense facilities and surrounding areas, the MOD has taken measures to prevent, reduce or mitigate aircraft noise
and other impacts caused by activities or by the establishment/operation of airport and other defense facilities in the surrounding area.

For stable stationing of the USFJ, it is essential to develop understanding and cooperation of the local governments and residents in vicinities of U.S. bases.
The MOD will work to constantly take various other measures, including coordination for unit operation of the USFJ with the local governments and other
parties, provision of subsidies pertaining to the USFJ realignment, immediate report to the local governments in cases of an incident or accident, and
exchange promotion between the USFJ and local residents.

Moreover, in response to the acceleration of domestic and overseas initiatives to achieve sustainable global environment, the MOD, as a member of the
government, also needs to contribute to solving environmental problems, while at the same time implementing measures with more focus on the
coexistence of SDF/USFJ facilities and areas with surrounding areas.

**Events and PR Facilities**

The MOD/SDF conducts activities to widely inform nationals of the current circumstances of the SDF. These activities include the GSDF Fuji Fire Power
Exercise, cruises to experience MSDF vessels, and demonstration fl ights and boarding experiences on aircraft. Furthermore, as part of the commemoration
of the SDF anniversary, the SDF Marching Festival is held at Nippon Budokan arena every year. In 2019 the festival was held in Gymnasium 1 of the
National Yoyogi Stadium due to renovation of Nippon Budokan, and approximately 38,500 visitors in total came.

Trends Concerning New Domains including Outer
Space, Cyberspace, and Electromagnetic
Spectrum, and Relevant Challenges Facing the
International Community


-----

**Overview**
###### 1


**❶ [Current Trends in Security Environment]**

What is notable about the current security environment is
that, fi rst of all, while interdependency among countries is
further expanding and deepening, thanks to further growth
of the national power of such countries as China, changes
in the balance of power are accelerating and becoming more
complex. In addition, uncertainty over the existing order is
increasing. Against such a backdrop, prominently emerging
is inter-state competition across the political, economic and
military realms, in which states seek to shape global and
regional order to their advantage as well as to increase their
infl uence.
Such inter-state competition occurs on a continuous basis.
In conducting inter-state competition, states leverage various
means such as undermining another country’s sovereignty
using military and law-enforcement entities, and manipulating
a foreign country’s public opinion by exploiting social media.
In such competition, “hybrid warfare” is sometimes adopted,
forcing affected actors to take complex measures not limited
to military ones. Also, so-called gray-zone situations, which
are neither purely peacetime nor contingency situations, are
becoming persistent over a long period of time, playing out
as part of inter-state competition. They may possibly further


**Chapter**


increase and expand. Such gray-zone situations harbor the
risk of rapidly developing into graver situations without
showing clear indications.
Secondly, technological progress is about to change
fundamentally how security should be managed. Against the
backdrop of the advance of military technology due to rapid
technological innovation in information & communications
and other fi elds, contemporary warfare increasingly
features capabilities combined across all domains: not only
land, sea and air but also new domains, which are space,
cyberspace and electromagnetic spectrum. Aiming to
improve overall military capability and acquire asymmetric
military capability, states are seeking to gain superiority in
technologies that undergird capabilities in new domains.
States endeavor to develop weapons that leverage cuttingedge, potentially game-changing technologies that could
drastically change the conduct of future warfare, including
artifi cial intelligence (AI), hypersonic, and high-power
energy technologies.
Progress in military technology relies heavily on the
development of civilian technologies. It is believed that
the development and international transfer of civilian

technologies will have a major impact on improvements in the
military capabilities of each country. Further technological
innovations hereafter are expected to make it diffi cult still to
foresee future warfare.
Thirdly, security challenges, which cannot be dealt with
by a single country alone, are prominently emerging.
First of all, securing the stable use of new domains such
as space and cyberspace has become an important challenge
for the security of the international community. In recent
years, countries are moving ahead with a reinforcement of
their comprehensive ability to combat cyber attacks. There
are also moves seen in the international community to
promote the rule of law in space and cyberspace, including
an establishment of certain norms of behavior.
In the maritime domain, there have been cases where a
country unilaterally claims its entitlement and takes actions
based on its own assertions that are incompatible with the
existing international order, thereby unduly infringing upon


the freedom of navigation in high seas and of overfl ight. In
addition, piracy acts have taken place in various parts of the
world.
The proliferation of weapons of mass destruction
(WMDs), such as nuclear, biological, and chemical (NBC)
weapons, and of ballistic missiles that serve as the means
of delivery of WMDs, and international terrorism are still
viewed as signifi cant threats to the international community.
Moreover, COVID-19 (coronavirus disease 2019), which
emerged since the end of 2019, has become a challenge
that should be addressed through cooperation across the
international community. How to deal with the spread of
COVID-19 is not only an issue of responding to an infectious
disease, but it also affects states’ economic activities. As it
is also generating various effects and constraints on states’
military activities, it is necessary to pay attention to the
impact on the security front.

**Section** **The United States**
**1**


**❶** **[Security and Defense Policie][s]**

It has been pointed out that the Trump administration, which

was inaugurated in January 2017, has signifi cantly changed the

patterns of U.S. involvement in the world under the “America

First” policy. On the other hand, it can be considered that while

the United States is focusing on global competition, the United

States has been continuing to play a role for world peace and

stability with its comprehensive national power, the largest

in the world, based on its belief that the values and infl uence

of the United States, bolstered by its power, would make the

world freer, safer, and more prosperous.

The United States branded China and Russia as

revisionist powers in its strategy documents outlining the

administration’s national security and defense policies,

as well as it has clarifi ed its intention to focus on strategic

competition with those two countries and has been moving

forward with various initiatives aimed at translating such

policies into action.

The United States has clearly indicated its willingness

to place the greatest emphasis on the security of the Indo
Pacifi c region to deter China in particular, and has set out a

policy of prioritizing the allocation of military forces to the

region. The United States has also clarifi ed its stance that it

will build new and stronger bonds with nations that share

its values across the region and maintain a forward military

presence in the region, in order to advance the U.S. vision

of a free and open Indo-Pacifi c. In terms of actions focused

on China, it is reported that U.S. naval vessels carried out

repeated “Freedom of Navigation Operations” in the South


**Chapter**


China Sea and transit through the Taiwan Strait, and that the

United States imposed sanctions on a Chinese military organ

and a leader. In August 2019, the U.S. government notifi ed

Congress of its intention to sell fi ghter jets to Taiwan for the

fi rst time in 27 years.

The United States is also sharpening its deterrence

stance against China through such moves as imposing

tariffs on Chinese hi-tech products, heightening scrutiny

of Chinese investment in the United States, and tightening

measures aimed at preventing technology theft and ensuring

competitiveness in fi elds where there is a risk of technology

being diverted to military uses. Congress is maintaining its

bipartisan support for the administration’s stance on China,

instructing the U.S. government in the National Defense

Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2020 to update its strategy

to counter China’s malign infl uence, as well as expressing

its desire to support improvements in Taiwan’s national

defense capability, and prohibiting the use and procurement

of Chinese-manufactured drones by the U.S. Department of

Defense (DoD).

The United States has positioned deterrence against

Russia in Europe as the next-highest priority in its national

defense strategy after deterrence against China in the Indo
Pacifi c region. In December 2018, immediately after Russia

detained the crew members of Ukrainian naval vessels in

the Kerch Strait, the United States conducted Freedom of

Navigation Operations in the vicinity of Peter the Great

Gulf for the fi rst time since 1987. In light of Russian

actions concerning Ukraine, the United States has sought to

strengthen involvement in North Atlantic Treaty Organization

(NATO) security and deterrence by deploying U.S. Forces

in Eastern Europe and substantially increasing investment

in the European Deterrence Initiative—a program intended

to increase the U.S. military presence in Europe—compared

with the sums invested under the previous administration.

The United States is also undertaking initiatives focused

on the development and deployment of low-yield nuclear

weapons to fi ll the capability gap in relation to Russia’s non
strategic nuclear weapons.

Under the recognition that actions and policies by North

Korea, —named in the strategy documents as a “rogue

regime”—to pursue nuclear and missile programs constitute

an extraordinary threat to the United States, it has maintained

sanctions and continues its efforts to pursue the complete

denuclearization of North Korea.

See 1-3 of this Section (Involvement in the Indo-Pacific Region)

See


Although the United States has set out a policy of

prioritizing the allocation of military forces to the Indo
Pacifi c region and Europe, while reducing forces in the

Middle East and Africa, it has also been dealing with security

issues in the latter regions and it would be hard to describe

the transition in the U.S. force posture as a smooth one. In

the Middle East, in response to the offensive from the Islamic

State of Iraq and the Levant (ISIL) and other organizations

in Iraq and Syria since 2014, the United States, since August

2014, has led Operation Inherent Resolve (OIR), a military

operation against ISIL that includes airstrikes. The March

2019 announcement that the United States had liberated all

the Iraqi and Syrian territory previously controlled by ISIL

was followed in October that year by the announcement

that ISIL leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi was dead after an

operation by U.S. Forces. Of the forces involved in OIR, the

U.S. Forces deployed in Syria are stationed in the east of the

country following their withdrawal from the vicinity of the

border with Turkey, due to a military operation undertaken

by the Turkish army in northern Syria in October 2019. The

U.S. contingent has been cut to some 600 soldiers from a

reported 1,000 or so prior to the withdrawal.

With regard to Afghanistan, in February 2020, the United

States signed an agreement with the Taliban that included

a conditional phased withdrawal by U.S. Forces. The

agreement stipulates that the United States will reduce its

military forces from a reported 12,000 to 13,000 troops to

8,600 within 135 days and, if the Taliban complies with the


US President Trump making an announcement on the Iranian ballistic missile attack in Iraq

[U.S. DoD]

agreement, will withdraw all troops, including NATO forces,

from Afghanistan within 14 months.

Furthermore, the United States has been increasing

pressure on Iran from many aspects, stating it is to bring Iran

to the negotiation table to conclude a comprehensive deal that

addresses activities that destabilize the Middle East region,

including the nuclear program. On January 3, 2020, amid rising

tensions with Iran, the U.S. military killed Qasem Soleimani,

commander of the Quds Force of Islamic Revolutionary Guard

Corps, in Iraq. Five days later, in retaliation, Iran launched 16

ballistic missiles at two bases in Iraq where U.S. Forces were

stationed. Although 12 of them hit the two bases, there are

believed to have been no fatalities as a result. That same day,

Iranian Foreign Minister Mohammad Javad Zarif stated that

Iran had concluded its proportionate reprisal and did not seek

additional tension or war. Also on January 8, President Trump

announced that the United States did not wish to use military

force. It thus became clear that both countries wished to avoid

further escalation.

In response to growing tensions with Iran and other

Middle Eastern countries, the U.S. military has announced

a number of troop deployments to the Middle East since

May 2019, for such purposes as countering the threat

posed by Iran to U.S. troops and interests. In addition to

such reinforcements to its posture, in July 2019, the United

States advocated the Maritime Security Initiative to promote

freedom of navigation and maritime stability in the Middle

East. As part of this initiative, it subsequently established the

International Maritime Security Construct (IMSC), through

which it undertakes activities using naval vessels, along with

countries including the United Kingdom.

The U.S. DoD is considering what constitutes appropriate

forces in Africa and in Central and South America, given

the need to secure resources. In January 2020, Secretary of


**Chapter**


-----

Defense Mark Esper indicated that he wished to achieve some

measure of progress in the transition of the U.S. military’s

force posture by the October 2020 start of fiscal year 2021.

In its security policies, the United States has indicated

its view that certain allies which are pointed out as bearing

only a small burden of cost and enjoying security guaranteed

by the United States should shoulder their fair share of

responsibility. As such, the United States has requested

that NATO member states swiftly meet their commitments

to increase their national defense spending to 2% of Gross

Domestic Product (GDP). Moreover, in negotiations over

host nation support for U.S. Forces Korea, it has demanded

that the Republic of Korea (ROK) shoulder a bigger share of

the burden.

Three years have passed since the inauguration of the

Trump administration and most of the policies set out in its

strategy document have entered the implementation phase.

While even the divided Congress continue to support the

administration’s paramount policy of deterrence against

China and Russia, attention will focus on how U.S. security

and national defense policies allocate resources, as the arenas

in which the United States pursues its strategic competition

with China and Russia expand across the globe.

Within the United States, individual states, territories

and the District of Columbia are responding to the novel

coronavirus disease that first emerged in 2019 by using

the National Guard such as transporting medical supplies

and food, while the DoD is supporting domestic measures

through a range of efforts such as deploying hospital ships

and setting up field hospitals. At the same time, as a number

of U.S. Forces personnel have been infected, including crew

members on an aircraft carrier, the U.S. military has been

taking steps to prevent the infection spreading further, by

such means as imposing restrictions on movement and other

communicable disease control measures. In March 2020,

Secretary of Defense Esper commented that although the

virus spreads might have some impact on the readiness of

U.S. Forces, routine training was continuing to maintain a

high state of readiness and that the virus would not affect the

U.S. military’s ability to conduct its missions both at home

and abroad. He also stated that the extent of the future impact

would depend on the scope of the response to the novel

coronavirus and how long it lasts.

**1** Perception about Security Environment


2017 indicates that changes in a regional balance of power

can have global consequences and threaten U.S. interests. It

mentions the three main sets of challengers against the United

States and its allies and partners, which are the “revisionist

powers” of China and Russia, the “rogue states” of Iran and

North Korea, and transnational threat organizations, including

jihadist terrorist groups. Of these, China and Russia are said

to challenge American power, influence, and interests and

attempt to erode American safety and prosperity, while North

Korea and Iran destabilize regions and threaten the United

States and its allies.

In addition, the National Defense Strategy (NDS)

published in January 2018 points out that the primary

concern in U.S. security is not terrorism but rather long-term

strategic competition with China and Russia. It also mentions

that China and Russia are undermining the free and open

international order constructed by the United States and its

allies, and it is increasingly clear that China and Russia want

to shape a world consistent with their authoritarian model.

In October 2019, Secretary of Defense Esper stated that the

NDS positioned China as its first priority and Russia as its

second. In September, he expressed a particularly strong

sense of caution with respect to China, commenting that

while Russia was the greatest near-term challenge, China’s

tremendous economic potential meant it posed a major

challenge in the long term.

Furthermore, regarding the military actions carried out

with the United Kingdom and France after determining

that Syria’s Assad regime had used chemical weapons in

April 2018, President Trump stated that establishing strong

deterrence against the production, proliferation, and use of

chemical weapons is an important interest for the national

security of the United States.

In consideration of this recognition, the United States

deems as security threats nations and organizations that

attempt to undermine the interests of itself and its allies and

threaten the international order. The Trump administration

is addressing threats posed by China and Russia—with

particular emphasis on China—as priority issues and appears

to be continuing a policy of dealing with threats posed by

North Korea, Iran, radical terrorist groups, and production,

proliferation, and use of weapons of mass destruction.

**2** Security and NDS


**Chapter**


The NSS developed by President Trump is rooted in the

America First policy and realism in which power plays a


The National Security Strategy (NSS) released in December


-----

central role in international politics, and stresses the need

to rethink the policies of the past 20 years that were based

on the assumption that engagement with rivals and their

inclusion in the international community would turn them

into benign actors and trustworthy partners. Moreover, the

NSS sets up a strategic policy to protect four vital interests

in this competitive world: (1) Protect the American people,

the homeland, and the American way of life; (2) Promote

American prosperity; (3) Preserve peace through strength;

and (4) Advance American influence. In October 2019, Vice

President Mike Pence indicated that the views set out in the

NSS remained unchanged at that point, stating that the United

States did not believe that economic engagement alone would

transform Communist China’s authoritarian state into a free

and open society that respects private property, the rule of

law, and international rules of commerce.

Furthermore, in addition to rebuilding the U.S. military

to the strongest armed forces and strengthening capabilities

in many areas including space and cyberspace, the United

States is also striving to leverage the balance of power in the

Indo-Pacific, Europe, and the Middle East. Moreover, while

recognizing that allies and partners are a great strength of the

United States and close cooperation is necessary, the United

States has demanded that its allies and partners demonstrate

the will to confront shared threats and contribute the

capabilities. It is also pointed out that although the United

States is responding to the growing political, economic,

and military competition throughout the world, by ensuring

American military power is second to none and fully

integrating with its allies all instruments of power, the United

States will seek areas of cooperation with competitors from

a position of strength.

The NDS drawn up by then Secretary of Defense Mattis

based on the NSS considers the long-term competition with

China and Russia as the principal priorities of the DoD

because of the magnitude of the threats they pose to U.S.

security and prosperity and the potential for those threats

to increase. Moreover, to expand the competitive space, the

following three lines of effort are raised: (1) building a more

lethal Joint Force; (2) strengthening alliances and attracting

new partners; and (3) reforming the DoD for greater

performance and affordability.

Among these, (1) Building military power prioritizes

preparedness for war and in order to defeat aggression by a

major power and deter opportunistic aggression elsewhere,

it advances building flexible theater postures and force

deployment that offer mobility, resilience, and readiness. It


also advocates modernizing key capabilities such as nuclear

forces, space and cyberspace, C4ISR (command, control,

communication, computer, intelligence, surveillance, and

reconnaissance), missile defense, and advanced autonomous

systems, etc. Further, although indicating its commitment to

deter aggression, it also demonstrates the stance that dynamic

military force employment, military posture, and operations

must introduce unpredictability to adversary decision
makers. For (2) Strengthening alliances, the following three

matters are emphasized: (i) Uphold a foundation of mutual

respect, responsibility, priorities, and accountability, (ii)

Expand regional consultative mechanisms and collaborative

planning, and (iii) Deepen interoperability. On the other

hand, there are expectations that allies and partners contribute

an equitable share to mutually beneficial collective security,

including effective investment in modernizing their defense

capabilities.

**3** Involvement in the Indo-Pacific Region


**Chapter**


The Trump administration has positioned the Indo-Pacific

region as the highest-priority region for the United States

and has shown a stance of placing importance on the region

through the United States’ commitment to the region and

strengthening its presence.

During his November 2017 trip to Asia, in consonance

with Japan’s vision for a free and open Indo-Pacific, President

Trump expressed his intention to emphasize compliance with

principles such as respecting the rule of law and freedom of

navigation, and that he would promote a free and open Indo
Pacific region, as well as strengthen alliances in the region.

In relation to this, the NSS emphasizes that China seeks

to displace the United States in the Indo-Pacific region and

reorder the region in its favor, as well as having mounted a

rapid military modernization campaign to limit U.S. access to

the region and to provide itself a freer hand there. Moreover,

as part of its Indo-Pacific region strategy, while reinforcing

its commitment to freedom of the seas and the peaceful

resolution of territorial and maritime disputes in accordance

with international law, the United States will seek to increase

quadrilateral cooperation with Japan, Australia, and India

and develop a strong defense networks with its allies and

partners. In the same way, the NDS points out that China

is leveraging military modernization, influence operations,

and predatory economics to coerce neighboring countries

to reorder the Indo-Pacific region to their advantage and is

seeking regional hegemony. It emphasizes that a free and open


-----

Indo-Pacific provides prosperity and security, and that the

United States will strengthen its alliances and partnerships in

the Indo-Pacific to a networked security architecture capable

of deterring aggression, maintaining stability, and ensuring

free access to common domains.

Meanwhile, the Indo-Pacific Strategy Report (IPSR) of

the U.S. DoD, which was released in June 2019, fleshes out

this policy in accordance with the characteristics of the Indo
Pacific region while retaining the strategic directions of the

NSS and the NDS. Noting first of all that it is necessary to

establish a force that is prepared to win any conflict from its

onset in order to achieve peace through strength, the IPSR

states that the United States will ensure that combat-credible

forces are forward-postured in the Indo-Pacific region and

will prioritize investments that ensure lethality against high
end adversaries. Next, arguing that the network of allies and

partners is a force multiplier to achieve deterrence, the IPSR

states that the United States will reinforce its commitment to

established alliances and partnerships while also expanding

and deepening relationships with new partners. The IPSR also

indicates that the United States will evolve U.S. alliances and

partnerships into a networked security architecture to uphold

the international rules-based order.

In May 2018, regarding China’s maritime expansion, the

U.S. DoD stated that China had deployed anti-ship missiles

and surface-to-air missiles to the features in the Spratly

Islands, and pointed out that the placement of these weapon

system was only military use. As an initial response to China’s

continued militarization of areas in the South China Sea, the

United States disinvited the Chinese navy to the multilateral

Rim of the Pacific Exercise (RIMPAC) in 2018. In a speech

about the United States’ policy towards China in October

2019, Vice President Pence remarked that China’s behavior

in the region had been increasingly provocative and asserted

that no nation has the right to claim the maritime commons

as territorial seas. He then stated that the United States had

increased the tempo and scope of its Freedom of Navigation

Operations and strengthened its military presence across

the Indo-Pacific. It is reported that U.S. Forces conducted

Freedom of Navigation Operations within 12 nautical miles

of the disputed islands and reefs in the South China Sea

claimed by China and in surrounding waters four times in

2017, five times in 2018, and eight times in 2019.

As part of its activities around strengthening its presence

in the Indo-Pacific region, the U.S. Forces deployed Marine

Corps specification F-35B fighters to MCAS Iwakuni in

January 2017. The USS America, an amphibious assault


ship with enhanced ability to carry F-35B fighters and other

carrier-based planes, arrived in Sasebo in December 2019 to

replace the amphibious assault ship USS Wasp. In addition,

the amphibious transport dock USS New Orleans was also

deployed to Sasebo that month. In Guam, the MQ-4C Triton

maritime surveillance unmanned aircraft system underwent

its first deployment in January 2020. Between January and

November 2019, the U.S. Coast Guard deployed patrol boats

on a rotational basis in the western Pacific Ocean while

working with the Seventh Fleet. The Army plans to deploy

a Multi-Domain Task Force in the region, to undertake

operations in all domains. In March 2018, the aircraft carrier

USS Carl Vinson made the first port call by a U.S. aircraft

carrier in over 40 years in Vietnam. Another port call in the

country was made in March 2020, by the aircraft carrier USS

Theodore Roosevelt. The United States reportedly deployed

naval vessels on passages through the Taiwan Strait on three

occasions in 2018 and 10 in 2019.

Given the perceptions of China and regional strategy

described above, the United States appears to be undertaking

initiatives based on its vision of a free and open Indo-Pacific.

In contrast, while talks between the United States and North

Korea have been continuing since their first summit meeting

in history held in June 2018, little material progress has been

seen with regard to the dismantlement of North Korea’s

missiles and weapons of mass destruction. Responding to

that summit meeting, the U.S. DoD suspended the U.S.-ROK

command and control exercise Ulchi-Freedom Guardian and

the scheduled Vigilant Ace U.S.-ROK bilateral annual flying

exercise, and then decided to conclude the Key Resolve and

Foal Eagle series of exercises usually held by the United States

and the ROK every spring. Then Acting Secretary of Defense

Patrick Shanahan expressed a willingness to maintain U.S.

Forces in ROK, stating that close coordination between the

Aircraft carrier USS “Theodore Roosevelt” sailing to a port in Vietnam

-----

military activities of the United States and ROK will continue

to support diplomatic efforts and that the two countries were

committed to ensuring the continued combined defense

posture of U.S.-ROK combined forces and maintaining firm

military readiness. Having rearranged the training elements

that had been incorporated into these large-scale U.S.-ROK

exercises, the U.S. military determined that the majority

were covered off with the ROK military and assessed that

readiness was being maintained. Amid this situation, as

well as firing at least 20 ballistic missiles from May 2019

onwards, North Korea announced in December 2019 that it

would continue to develop strategic weapons until the United

States rolls back its hostile policy. The United States pointed

out that, regardless of their range, North Korea’s ballistic

missile launches violated United Nations Security Council

Resolutions. While demonstrating a sense of caution about

advances in North Korean weapons technology, however, the

United States indicated its intention to continue with bilateral

talks.

See Section 3-1-5 (1) of this Chapter (Relations with the United

States)

longer afford to focus on development programs that take

many years to complete. Commenting that, unlike previous

eras where national defense drove technology research and

development, the DoD now sees significant innovation in the

private sector, he pointed out the need for the U.S. military

to integrate game-changing technologies from the private

sector into its systems. In addition, Vice Chairman of the

Joint Chiefs of Staff John Hyten commented in January 2020

that the DoD has attached greater importance to avoiding

risk than to the speed of technology development in recent

years and stressed the necessity of learning from failures

while moving quickly forward with development, as well

as mentioning the need to tap into cutting-edge fields in the

private sector.

**5** Nuclear and Missile Defense Policy


**Chapter**


The Nuclear Posture Review (NPR) released in February

2018 stated that, although the United States had reduced the

role and number of nuclear weapons based on the aspiration

that if the United States took the lead in reducing nuclear

arms, other states would follow, the global threat conditions

have worsened markedly since the most recent NPR released

in 2010 and there now exist unprecedented threats and

uncertainty, as China and Russia have expanded their nuclear

forces and North Korea continues its pursuit of nuclear

weapons and missile capabilities. Given these circumstances,

the following were raised as the roles of U.S. nuclear forces:

(1) Deterrence of nuclear and nonnuclear attacks; (2)

Assurance of allies and partners; (3) Achievement of U.S.

objectives if deterrence fails; and (4) Capacity to hedge

against an uncertain future.

Also, while the United States would only consider the

employment of nuclear weapons in extreme circumstances to

defend the vital interests of the United States, its allies, and

partners, the NPR clearly states that extreme circumstances

could include significant non-nuclear strategic attacks against

the United States and its allies, and a “no first use” policy is not

justified today. It also indicates that the United States maintains

a policy of retaining some ambiguity regarding the precise

circumstances that might lead to a U.S. nuclear response.

Furthermore, it also revealed that the United States would

apply a tailored approach to deterrence across a spectrum of

adversaries, threats and contexts, and in addition, would ensure

effective deterrence by enhancing the flexibility and range of

its nuclear capabilities through nuclear modernization and the

development and deployment of new capabilities. Specifically,


Although the Trump administration has stopped using the

name Third Offset Strategy, which was touted by the Obama

administration, DoD innovation initiatives are positioned as

one of the top priorities. In fact, the NSS outlines a policy

that the United States must harness innovative technologies

that are being developed outside of the traditional defense

industrial base. The NDS also states that the DoD needs

innovation to surpass revisionist powers, and calls for

extensive investment in military application of autonomy,

artificial intelligence, and machine learning (AI/ML),

including rapid application of commercial breakthroughs, to

gain competitive military advantages.

Giving testimony before Congress in March 2019 about

science and technology in the field of national defense, Under

Secretary of Defense for Research and Engineering Michael

Griffin expressed alarm at the pace of Chinese and Russian

technological advances, while setting out a policy of regaining

and maintaining the United States’ technical advantage

through investments in hypersonics, directed energy, space,

autonomy, cyber, quantum science, microelectronics,

biotechnology, AI/ML, and fully-networked command,

control, and communication. In September 2019, Secretary

of Defense Esper stated that the United States could no


-----

in addition to sustaining and replacing the nuclear triad,[1] as new

capabilities, in the near-term, the United States would modify

a small number of existing submarine-launched ballistic

missiles (SLBM) warheads to provide a low-yield option,[2]

and in the longer term, pursue a nuclear-armed sea-launched

cruise missile (SLCM), leveraging existing technologies, as

well as incorporate nuclear capability onto F-35A fi ghters as a

replacement for the current aging dual-capable aircraft (DCA).

Also, the United States has shown its commitment to extended

deterrence for its allies and, if necessary, maintaining the

forward-deployed capability with DCA and nuclear weapons

in regions outside Europe, including Northeast Asia.

In October 2018, President Trump expressed his intention

to withdraw from the Intermediate-Range Nuclear Forces

(INF) Treaty with Russia, due to Russia’s material breach, and

in February 2019, the United States provided Russia with

formal notice that the United States would withdraw from the

treaty. The United States also expressed that if Russia does

not return to full and verifi able compliance with the treaty in

six months, the treaty would terminate.[3]

On August 2, 2019, Secretary of State Pompeo announced

that the U.S. withdrawal pursuant to Article XV of the treaty

took effect that day because Russia failed to return to full

and verifi ed compliance. On the same day, Secretary of

Defense Esper announced that the DoD will fully pursue the

development of intermediate-range, conventional, ground
launched cruise and ballistic missile systems whose test

launches, production and possession had been restricted by

the treaty. In August 2019, the United States conducted a

fl ight test of a conventionally-confi gured ground-launched

cruise missile with a range of more than 500 km and

subsequently conducted a fl ight test of a prototype similarly

confi gured ground-launched ballistic missile that December

(See Section 4-3-1).[4] President Trump has mentioned the

need for arms control involving China, which has beefed up


medium-range missile capabilities outside the scope of the

INF Treaty.

See Section 4-3-1 of this Chapter (Nuclear Forces)

At the same time, the Missile Defense Review (MDR)

published in January 2019 noted that North Korea continues

to pose an extraordinary threat to the United States and,

with its nuclear missiles, has the ability to threaten the

U.S. homeland, as well as U.S. territories, U.S. Forces, and

allies in the Pacifi c Ocean. It also pointed out that Russia

and China are developing advanced cruise missiles and

hypersonic missiles that challenge existing missile defense

systems. The MDR sets out three principles governing U.S.

missile defense: (1) homeland missile defense will stay

ahead of rogue states’ missile threats; (2) missile defense

will defend U.S. Forces deployed abroad and support the

security of allies and partners; and (3) the United States will

pursue new concepts and technologies. It cited the elements

of missile defense strategy as (1) comprehensive missile

defense capabilities; (2) fl exibility and adaptability; (3)

tighter offense-defense integration and interoperability; and

(4) importance of space. The MDR then presented a policy

of adopting a balanced and integrated approach based on a

combination of (1) deterrence; (2) active and passive missile

defenses; and (3) attack operations.

Under this policy, the United States plans to expand

investment in expanding and modernizing U.S. homeland

missile defense capabilities by such means as deploying an

additional 20 ground-based interceptors by 2023, improving

and deploying radar systems, and pursuing efforts to counter

intercontinental ballistic missiles (ICBM) using SM-3 Block

IIA. For regional defense, on the other hand, the United States

will procure additional interceptor missiles for the Terminal

High Altitude Area Defense (THAAD), Aegis, and Patriot

systems, as well as increasing the number of Aegis BMD

**Column** Intermediate-Range Nuclear Forces (INF) Treaty

A treaty abolishing land-based ballistic and cruise missiles and fl ight testing. It was signed by the United States and the
with ranges of 500-5,500 km and banning their production Soviet Union in 1987 and ended in August 2019.


The nuclear triad consists of Minuteman III ICBM, Ballistic Missile Submarines (SSBN) armed with Trident II D5 SLBM, and strategic bombers B-52 and B-2.

In February 2020, then Under Secretary of Defense for Policy John Rood disclosed that the U.S. Navy had already deployed the W76-2 low-yield nuclear warhead to be carried by SLBMs.
This complementary capability is regarded as showing Russia and other potential adversaries that there is no advantage in the limited use of nuclear weapons.

Since the collapse of the Soviet Union in 1991, the countries covered by the treaty have increased: the countries covered at present are the United States, Russia, Belarus, Kazakhstan,
Turkmenistan, Ukraine and Uzbekistan. Under Article 15 of the INF Treaty, notifi cation of withdrawal must be made to all signatory countries of the treaty.

In August 2019, Secretary of Defense Esper remarked that it was going to take a few years to actually have newly developed ground-launched cruise and ballistic missiles to be able to

capable ships, and equipping Aegis Ashore sites with the

SM-3 Block IIA. Regarding the pursuit of new technologies,

the MDR sets out a policy of developing the Multi-Object

Kill Vehicle (MOKV) to improve the ability to engage ICBM

warheads and decoys, as well as undertaking research and

development focused on (1) directed-energy weapons; (2)

space-based interceptor systems; and (3) interceptor missiles

with which F-35 fighters can be equipped, to enable space
based sensors to be deployed and interception to be carried

out in the boost phase, with a view to countering advanced

threats, including hypersonic glide vehicles (HGVs). As

far as collaboration with allies and partners is concerned,

the MDR indicates a willingness to focus on deepening

interoperability, expanding burden sharing, and encouraging

investment by allies in missile defense capabilities that are

interoperable with those of the United States.

**6** FY2021 Budget


the sequestration of defense spending in order to rebuild the

U.S. military, a defense budget framework was approved that

drastically raised the limit set by the sequestration between

FY2018 and FY2021.

In these circumstances, the defense budget request in the

FY2021 Budget Blueprint submitted to Congress in February

2020 allocated US$705.4 billion for the base budget,[5] which

excludes emergencies, representing about a 0.1% increase

over the previous year. The DoD positioned the budget as a

priority initiative supporting operations in all domains, which

forms the next step in implementing the NDS, emphasizing

(1) the reconstruction of the nuclear deterrent; (2) U.S.

homeland missile defense; (3) cyber and space capabilities;

and (4) hypersonic, 5G, AI, and other key technologies. It

included a request for an unprecedented sum for research

and development (approximately US$106.6 billion), while

raising around US$5.7 billion for reallocation to priority

initiatives from programs that do not accord with the NDS by

such means as rethinking programs undertaken by the Office

of the Secretary of Defense and the Joint Chiefs of Staff. The

goals for military end strength and procurement presented

in the FY2021 budget request included securing 1,351,500

personnel, adding 5,500 more troops to the services’ end

strength, and procuring 89 upgraded M-1 tanks (165 tanks

in the previous year), 8 battle-force ships (12 in the previous

year), and 79 F-35 fighters (98 in the previous year).

**Chapter**


Based on an awareness that the U.S. Government’s budget

deficit is deepening, the Budget Control Act enacted in

2011 stipulated a significant cut in government spending by

FY2021. In March 2013, the sequestration of government

spending including defense expenditure was started based

on the provisions of the Budget Control Act. However,

sequestration was subsequently eased due in part to the

passage of bipartisan budget acts on four occasions. In

addition, under the Trump administration’s policy to end

The breakdown is as follows: a base budget of approximately US$636.4 billion, and approximately US$69.0 billion for overseas contingency operations. This represents an increase of
about US$0.8 billion from the FY2020 enacted budget level (excluding the approximately US$8.0 billion for emergencies in the FY2020 enacted budget). The total sum of the FY2021
national defense budget request was roughly US$740.5 billion, including defense-related budget requests from other departments of roughly US$35.1 billion (such as the Department of
Energy’s nuclear related programs) and the roughly US$705 4 billion of DoD budget request

**[Military Posture ]**
**❷**


In August 2019, the United States founded the Space

Command to serve as a geographic unified combatant

command and then established the Space Force as the sixth

branch of the military within the Department of the Air Force

that December.

See Fig. I-2-1-2 (Structure of the Unified Combatant Command)

Column (Establishment of the Space Force)


**1** General Situation

The operation of the U.S. Forces is not controlled by the

individual branches of the broader armed forces; rather it

is operated under the command of the Unified Combatant

Commands, composed of forces from multiple branches of

the armed forces. The Unified Combatant Commands consist

of four commands with functional responsibilities and seven

commands with regional responsibilities.

The U.S. ground forces have about 470,000 Army soldiers

and about 190,000 Marines, which are forward-deployed in

Germany, the ROK, and Japan, among other countries.

The U.S. maritime forces have about 980 vessels

(including about 70 submarines) totaling about 6.9 million

tons. The 6th Fleet is responsible for the East Atlantic Ocean,

the Mediterranean Sea, and Africa; the 5th Fleet in the Persian

Gulf, the Red Sea, and the northwest Indian Ocean; the 3rd

Fleet in the eastern Pacific; the 4th Fleet in South America

and the Caribbean Sea; and the 7th Fleet in the western

Pacific and the Indian Ocean. In addition, the Second Fleet

was reestablished in August 2018 to take responsibility for

the U.S. East Coast, North Atlantic Ocean, and Arctic Ocean.

The U.S. air forces have roughly 3,560 combat aircraft

across the Air Force, Navy, and Marine Corps. In addition to

carrier-based aircraft deployed at sea, part of the tactical air

force is forward-deployed in Germany, the United Kingdom,

Japan, and the ROK, among others.

In regard to strategic offensive weapons including

nuclear force, the United States under the former Obama

administration proceeded with their reduction based on a

new Strategic Arms Reduction Treaty that came into force

in February 2011. It announced that its deployed strategic

warheads[6] stood at 1,373, while its deployed delivery

platforms stood at 655.[7] The United States is studying the

concept of a Conventional Prompt Global Strike (CPGS), as

an effort contributing to the nation’s new ability to reduce

reliance on nuclear weapons.

Moreover, in addressing the increasing threats in

cyberspace, in May 2018, the Cyber Command, which

was previously a subunified command under U.S. Strategic

Command, was elevated to a unified combatant command.

to amend an ordinance to allow criminal suspects to be

extradited to mainland China. Combined with public concern

about the security measures taken by the Chinese central

government and the Hong Kong government in light of the

series of protests, there is no prospect of the volatility of the

situation diminishing. Amid these circumstances, the Chinese

Government has been tightening its control over society.

While it has been suggested that the development of the

Internet and other areas of information and communications

technology (ICT) has made it diffi cult to control activities

of the masses, it has been noted that rapidly developing ICT

technologies are exploited for social control. Since 2014,

China has enacted laws based on “a holistic view of national

security” that covers not only external threats but also culture

and society. Those laws include the Anti-Spy Law enacted

in November 2014 to enhance domestic counter-espionage

arrangements, a new National Security Law in July 2015,

an Anti-Terrorism Law in January 2016 to strengthen state

control, the Law on Management of Domestic Activities

of Overseas Non-governmental Organizations in January

2017 to enhance control on foreign non-governmental

organizations (NGOs), and the National Intelligence Law in

June 2017.

The “anti-corruption” movement following the launch of

the Xi Jinping leadership has made inroads under the policy

of cracking down on both “tigers” and “fl ies,” targeting

both dominant fi gures and junior offi cials. People including

former prominent leaders of the Party and military have

China, the world’s most populous country, has a vast

landmass surrounded by a long borderline as well as a long

coastline. It also has various races, religions, and languages.

China’s pride in its unique history of having shaped a distinct

culture and civilization, and semi-colonial experience in and

after the 19th century are driving its desire for a strong nation

and fueling its nationalism.

In recent years, China has increased its presence in the

international community including the global economy.

China takes a proactive stance towards efforts in security

areas, contributing to United Nations (UN) Peacekeeping

Operations (PKO), counter-piracy activities off the coast of

Somalia and in the Gulf of Aden, and various humanitarian

assistance and disaster relief activities. There continues to be

high expectations for China to recognize its responsibility

in the international community, accept and comply with

international norms, and play an active role in a more

cooperative manner on regional and global issues.

China faces various domestic problems including

human rights issues. Among the problems emerging are

the spread of bribery and corruption among the leadership

of the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) and such issues

as disparities between urban and rural areas, and between

coastal and inland regions, as well as disparities within

cities and environmental pollution. More recently, the pace

of China’s economic growth has slowed and the country is

also expected to face issues associated with the rapid aging

of the population, including problems related to pensions

and other aspects of the social security system. The range of

factors potentially destabilizing government administration

has thus been expanding and becoming increasingly diverse.

Additionally, there have been protests about human rights

violations against ethnic minorities in China and campaigns

pursuing separation and independence of the Tibet

Autonomous Region, the Xinjiang Uyghur Autonomous

Region, and elsewhere. The international community has

grown interested in human rights conditions in the Xinjiang

Uyghur Autonomous Region. In 2019, large-scale protest

rallies occurred in Hong Kong over such issues as a bill

Xi has stated that “corruption is the greatest threat our Party

faces,” indicating that the “anti-corruption” movement will

continue.

Through these developments, the Party has demonstrated

a growing willingness in recent years to further bolster the

power base of General Secretary Xi in the CCP. For example,

it decided at the 19th National Congress in October 2017 to

incorporate “thoughts,” namely the political philosophy,

since President Mao Zedong that a leader had his name in

a guideline before retirement. Moreover, at the fi rst plenary

session of the 13th National People’s Congress held in March

2018, a resolution was adopted to revise the constitution and

abolish term limits for China’s president, which indicates

that Xi Jinping is further consolidating power as president.

the establishment of operational capabilities further afi eld.

China is also prioritizing efforts to increase practical joint

operational capabilities through military modernization

including reforms. Additionally, while implementing a

policy of civil-military fusion across the board, with the aim

of promoting two-way links between military and civilian

resources in technology development and various other

fi elds, China is striving to develop and acquire cutting-edge

technologies that can be used for military purposes. Cutting
edge technologies that China seeks to develop and acquire

include game changing technologies that would dramatically

change future warfare.

China’s 2019 white paper, “China’s National Defense in

the New Era,” released in July 2019, notes that “intelligent

warfare is on the horizon,” indicating that attention should

be paid to Chinese forces’ efforts to use artifi cial intelligence

(AI) technology.

Along with efforts to reinforce its operational capabilities,

China is engaging in unilateral and coercive attempts

to change the status quo based on its own assertions

incompatible with the existing international order, and has

been expanding and intensifying its military activities in

**1** General Situation

For more than 30 years, China has sustained high-level

growth of its defense budget without transparency, engaging

in broad, rapid improvement of its military power in

qualitative and quantitative terms with focus on nuclear,

missile, naval and air forces. In doing so, it has attached

importance to strengthening its operational capabilities

for steadily acquiring information superiority as a means

of both enhancing operational capabilities throughout the

Chinese military and gaining asymmetrical capabilities to

effectively impede enemies with overall military superiority

from exerting their strength. Specifi cally, China has been

increasingly emphasizing endeavors to achieve dominance in

new domains. For example, it has been rapidly expanding its

capabilities in the cyber domain, enabling it to disrupt enemy

communications networks, and in the fi eld of electromagnetic

spectrum, which offers the potential to render enemy radar and

other equipment ineffective, thereby hampering their ability

to exercise their military might. In addition, it continues to

build capacity to make it possible to restrict enemies’ use

of space. Bolstering these capabilities will reinforce China’s

“Anti-Access/Area-Denial (A2/AD)” capabilities and lead to

mobilization arrangements for emergency. In particular,
initiatives in seas, outer space, cyberspace, artificial
intelligence (AI), which are referred to as “emerging
areas” for China are viewed as priority areas for civil-
military fusion.

maritime and aerial domains, notably in the East China

Sea. China, particularly regarding maritime issues where its

interests conflict with others’, continues to act in an assertive

manner, which includes dangerous acts that could cause

unintended contingencies. Additionally, China continues to

demonstrate its willingness to realize its unilateral assertions

without making any compromises, steadily moving forward

with efforts to change the status quo by coercion and to

create a fait accompli.

The Chinese military leadership has exhibited the

“struggle” against the Senkaku Islands, an inherent territory

of Japan, the establishment of the “East China Sea Air

Defense Identification Zone (ADIZ),” [1] its Navy and Air

Force’s “regular patrols,” and others as the achievements

of the military forces’ activities and emphasized to continue

improving the Chinese military’s operational capabilities.

Furthermore, the Chinese military forces have rapidly

expanded and intensified activities including those in the

areas surrounding Japan, such as the East China Sea, Pacific

Ocean and Sea of Japan. Given these facts, there is a high

probability that China would not only attempt to make such

activities routine but also further expand and intensify them

both qualitatively and quantitatively. Such Chinese military

trends, combined with insufficient transparency about

China’s defense policies and military affairs, have become a

matter of grave concern to the region including Japan and the

international community and should continue to be closely

monitored in the future.

**2** Defense Policies


nation. China contends that these national defense policies

are “defensive” in nature.[2]

For the development of national defense and military


forces, China has employed a policy of building the “system

of modern military power with Chinese characteristics” by

sustaining the military development under the party, the

military buildup through reforms, military promotion based on

science and technology, and law-based military governance,

by pursuing practical capabilities that “can fight and win a

war” by giving greater priority to the civil-military fusion, by

promoting the fusion and development of mechanization and

informatization, and by accelerating the intelligentization of

military forces. This might have apparently deepened a policy

of giving priority to the informatization of military forces

based on a military strategy to win informatized local wars

in response to the global trend of military development. Such

military buildup in China apparently indicates that China

has given top priority to dealing with a Taiwan contingency

by improving its capabilities to deter or deny Taiwan’s

independence and foreign military support for the Taiwanese

independence, and has recently considered the improvement

of operational capabilities in more distant waters to protect

its expanding overseas interests.


**Chapter**


Furthermore, China seems to emphasize not only physical

means but also non-physical means in military affairs and

warfare. It regards the concept of “Three Warfares” — “Media

Warfare,” “Psychological Warfare,” and “Legal Warfare”

— as part of the political work of the military. In addition,

China has set forth a policy of coordinating military struggle

closely with political, diplomatic, economic, cultural, and

legal endeavors.

As for the future goals of the development of national

defense and military forces, General Secretary Xi Jinping’s

report to the 19th CCP National Congress in October 2017

and the defense white paper released in 2019 noted that China

would try to (1) basically achieve mechanization and make

great progress in informatization to dramatically improve

strategic capabilities by 2020, (2) basically complete the

modernization of national defense and military forces by

2035, and (3) generally transform Chinese forces into world
class forces by the mid-21st century. These goals reportedly


China has described the objectives of its defense policies and

the missions of its military forces as: supporting the CCP’s

leadership, China’s characteristic socialism system, and

the modernization of its socialism, defending the nation’s

sovereignty, unification and security, backing the nation’s

sustainable “peaceful development” through protecting its

maritime and overseas national interests, building strong

national defense and massive military forces commensurate

with the interests of the nation’s security and the interests of

development, and providing strong assurances for realizing

the “Chinese dream” of the great revival of the Chinese


On November 23, 2013, China established the “East China Sea ADIZ” including the Senkaku Islands misleadingly indicated as if they were China’s territory. China requires aircraft flying in
the zone to abide by rules set by its Ministry of National Defense and claims to take military “defensive emergency measures” against aircraft failing to do so, unduly infringing on the
principle of freedom of overflight. Over the move to unilaterally change the status quo in the East China Sea, not only Japan but also the United States, the ROK, Australia, and the European
Union (EU) expressed concerns.

According to the defense white paper “China’s National Defense in the New Era” (July 2019)


-----

indicate that the third stage of the Three Stage Development

Strategy” for the basic modernization of national defense and

military forces by the middle of the 21st century would be

achieved 15 years ahead of schedule. The goals thus might

have been based on faster-than-expected progress in the

military modernization for China itself. Particularly since

late December 2015, China has tackled the military reform

to improve practical joint operational capabilities, achieving

steady, rapid progress. However, China has recognized a

wide gap between the real military modernization level and

the level required for national security, and between Chinese

and world-class military forces. Based on that recognition,

China may further accelerate the military modernization

against the backdrop of national power development and

General Secretary Xi’s enhancement of his power base in the

CCP and expansion of his power as Chairman of the Central

Military Commission.[3]

**3 Transparency Concerning Defense Policies and**
Military Affairs


have become increasingly complex. Others opine that the

military’s influential power on foreign policy decisions has

been changing. Attention is to be paid to such situations in

terms of crisis management as well.

Explanations that stoke concerns about Chinese military

decision-making and actions are also evident in comments

about the South China Sea, where China is seeking to

unilaterally change the status quo and to create a fait accompli.

At the press conference after the U.S.-China Summit Meeting

in September 2015, President Xi Jinping stated “China does

not have any intention to pursue militarization” in the South

China Sea, but in February the following year, Foreign

Minister Wang Yi described the facilities in the South China

Sea as “necessary self-defense facilities” that China was

developing in accordance with international law. In 2017,

reports in official media asserted that China had rationally

expanded the area of its “islands and reefs” in the South

China Sea to “strengthen the necessary military defense.”

China has released a defense white paper almost every

two years since 1998. Most recently, it released a defense

white paper in July 2019 for the first time in approximately

four years. The latest one was titled “China’s National

Defense in the New Era.” Although defense white papers

released in 2013 and 2015 covered specific topics only, with

the volume of descriptions reduced, the 2019 white paper

covered defense policies in general.

China’s influence in the international community has

risen politically, economically, and militarily. It has become

increasingly important for China to improve its transparency

regarding defense policies and military affairs, provide

fact-based explanations about its activities, and share and

observe international rules as a responsible country in the

international community to allay concerns about China. It is

strongly hoped that China will increase transparency through

such efforts as specific and accurate information disclosure.


**Chapter**


China has neither set out a clear and specific future vision of

its military strengthening, nor ensured adequate transparency

of its decision-making process in relation to military and

security affairs. Moreover, China has not fully disclosed

information such as specific weapons in possession,

procurement goals and results, organization and locations

of major units, records of main military operations and

exercises, and a detailed breakdown of its national defense

budget.

Incidents in which Chinese authorities provide factually


inaccurate explanations or refuse to admit facts regarding

Chinese military activities have been confirmed, inciting

concerns over China’s military decision-making and

actions. For example, the submerged transit of a Chinese

Navy submarine through Japan’s contiguous zone around

the Senkaku Islands was confirmed in January 2018, but

China did not acknowledge this. In recent years, amid the

significant changes in the environment surrounding the

military, including advances in specialization of the military

and diversification of missions associated with strengthening

of operational capabilities, some see that relations between

the CCP leadership and the People’s Liberation Army (PLA)


**4** National Defense Budget

China announced that its national defense budget for FY2020

was approximately 1,268 billion yuan (approximately

20,288.1 billion Japanese yen when the value is mechanically

converted at 16 yen per yuan).[4] This initial budget amount


The Central Military Commission is a leading and commanding organ to China’s armed forces. Formally, there are the CCP CMC and the People’s Republic of China CMC. However, each
consists of the same members, indicating both commissions as an organ for the party to control the armed forces.

China’s announced defense budget exceeded Japan’s defense-related expenditures in FY2007 and reached approximately four times in FY2020 (automatically converted based on
h t f ti fi l ) J ’ d f l t d dit h i d l t h d f d 20 ( i t l 1 2 ti i 30 )

budget, are used because only the central government expenditures were announced.


**Chapter**


represented a growth of approximately 6.6% (approximately

78.1 billion yuan) compared to the initial budget amount for

the previous fiscal year. China’s announced national defense

budget recorded a double-digit increase almost every year

between FY1989 and FY2015. The nominal size of China’s

announced national defense budget grew approximately 44
fold in the 30 years from FY1990 and approximately 2.4-fold

in the 10 years from FY2010. China positions the buildup

of defense capabilities as important a task as economic

development. It is believed that China has continued to invest

resources in the improvement of its defense capabilities in

tandem with its economic development. However, there have

been many years in which the announced annual national

defense budget increase rate exceeded the economic growth

(an increase in gross domestic product). Attention is to be

paid to how the slowdown in China’s economic growth

would affect its national defense budget.


As for a breakdown of the national defense budget,


past defense white papers specified personnel, training and

sustainment, and equipment expenses for the announced

national defense budgets for FY2007, FY2009 and FY2010
2017 (and expenses for active, reserve and militia forces for

FY2007 and FY2009). However, no more details have been

given.

See Fig. I-2-2-1 (Changes in China’s Announced Defense Budget)

**5** Military Posture


China’s armed forces are composed of the PLA, the People’s

Armed Police Force (PAP), and the militia. It is provided that

these bodies be instructed and commanded by the Central

Military Commission (CMC). The PLA is defined as a

people’s force created and led by the CCP, comprising the

Army, the Navy, the Air Force, the Rocket Force, the Strategic

Support Force, the Joint Logistics Support Force, etc.


In addition, it is noted that the amount of the announced

defense budget is considered to be only a part of its actual

military expenditures. For example, it is believed that

the announced defense budget does not include foreign

equipment procurement costs or research and development

(R&D) expenses. According to an analysis of the U.S. DoD,

actual defense spending in FY2018 was US$30 billion more

than the announced national defense budget amount.[5]


The PAP is designed to engage mainly in patrol, emergency

response, counterterrorism, maritime rights protection and

law enforcement, emergency rescue, defense operations, etc.

The militia is planned to engage in economic construction,

etc. in peacetime and undertake logistic support missions in

emergency.


According to “Annual Report to Congress: Military and Security Developments Involving the People’s Republic of China ” U S DoD (May 2019)

（1）Military Reforms

China is currently carrying out military reforms seen as

the largest in its history. In November 2015, Chairman Xi

unveiled China’s official position on a specific direction of

the military reforms for the first time, announcing that the


Chairman Xi is attempting to further enhance his leadership

in the CMC and the military.

There are views that dissatisfaction is growing within the

military and among veterans because of the rapid reforms.

Given that China plans to promote military reforms until

2020, attention will focus on the outcome of these military

reforms.


military reforms would be carried out by 2020.

By the end of 2016, the so-called “above-the-neck”

reforms in the center of the military were reported to have

basically been completed. Specifically, they abolished the

PLA’s seven Military Regions and created five new Theaters

with primary responsibility for command of operations,

namely, the Eastern Theater, Southern Theater, Western

Theater, Northern Theater, and Central Theater. In addition,

they also formed the PLA Army (PLAA) Headquarters—

ranked equally with the PLA Navy (PLAN) and PLA Air

Force (PLAAF) Headquarters—, the Rocket Force (PLARF),

the Strategic Support Force (PLASSF), and the Joint

Logistics Support Force. Moreover, the headquarters for the

entire PLA were replaced by 15 functional sections under the

CMC, including the Joint Staff Department, Political Work

Department, Logistics Support Department, and Equipment

Development Department. Since 2017, military reforms have

been making steady progress with the start of what are called

full-scale “below-the-neck” military reforms at the field

level. For example, the expansion of the Navy Marine Corps,

whose missions include amphibious landing operations, has

been confirmed along with the unification of PAP leadership

and command system under the CMC, and the reorganization

of 18 Group Armies into 13, a reduction of 300,000 soldiers,

the transfer of the coast guard to the PAP, etc.

It is considered that these series of reforms are designed

to build more practical military forces by improving their

joint operational capabilities and strengthening the military’s

readiness, including the development of military capabilities

and organizational management in peacetime. In addition, it

has been noted that the reorganization of the headquarters is

a means of tackling corruption at the center of the military

by decentralizing the leading organs. Since the 19th CCP

National Congress in October 2017, many members seen as

connected deeply to Chairman Xi have been appointed to the

CMC. It has been noted that many officers trusted deeply

by Chairman Xi have been promoted to senior positions and

the rank of general. Given these points, it is thought that


（2）Nuclear and Missile Forces

China has continued independent efforts to develop nuclear

weapons and missiles for their delivery since the mid-1950s,

indicating its apparent attempt to ensure nuclear deterrence,

supplement its conventional forces with nuclear capabilities

and secure its influence on the international community.

It is regarded that China’s nuclear strategy is to deter any

nuclear attack on its territory by maintaining a nuclear

force structure able to conduct retaliatory nuclear attacks

on a limited number of targets such as cities in adversary

countries, should China be subject to nuclear attacks.

China has explained that it is committed to “no first use” of

nuclear weapons under any circumstances, to “unconditional

negative security assurance” that it would not use or threaten

to use nuclear weapons against non-nuclear-weapon states or

nuclear-weapon-free zones unconditionally, and to keeping

its nuclear capabilities at the minimum level required for

national security. In recent years, however, doubts have been

expressed about the explanation.[6]

China is viewed as having given priority to conventional

missile capabilities since the 1990s because of the growing

significance of precision-strike capabilities in the global

military trend. China is expected to continue to attach

importance to its nuclear and missile forces.


**Chapter**


China possesses ballistic missiles of various types and

ranges, including ICBMs, SLBMs, intermediate-range

ballistic missiles (IRBMs)/medium-range ballistic missiles

(MRBMs), and short-range ballistic missiles (SRBMs).

The update of China’s ballistic missile forces from a liquid

propellant system to a solid propellant system is improving

their survivability and readiness. Moreover, it is believed

that China is working to increase their performance by such

means as extending ranges, improving targeting accuracy,

and employing maneuverable reentry vehicles (MaRVs) and

multiple independently targetable reentry vehicles (MIRVs).


According to “Annual Report to Congress: Military and Security Developments Involving the People’s Republic of China ” U S DoD (May 2019)


-----

China s main ICBMs, its strategic nuclear asset, had been

the fi xed-site liquid-propellant DF-5 missiles. However,

China has in recent years deployed the DF-31, which

is a mobile-type ICBM with a solid propellant system

mounted onto a transporter erector launcher (TEL). China is

developing the new DF-41 ICBM, which is viewed to be able

to fl y up to approximately 11,200 km and carry 10 warheads.

It made its fi rst appearance in the military parade to mark the

70th anniversary of the founding of the People’s Republic

of China in October 2019. With regard to SLBMs, it is

considered that Jin-class nuclear-powered ballistic missile

submarines to carry the JL-2 SLBMs with the estimated rage

of approximately 8,000 km are operational. It is believed

that China’s strategic nuclear capabilities will improve

signifi cantly through nuclear deterrence patrols using the

Jin-class SSBNs. Furthermore, it has been pointed out that

China is also developing the JL-3 SLBM with the extended

range of 12,000 to 14,000 km and a new SSBN for carrying

the JL-3.

China’s missile forces have been put outside the framework


are viewed as capable of carrying both conventional and

nuclear warheads. China possesses ballistic missiles carrying

conventional warheads with high targeting accuracy based on

the DF-21, including the DF-21D anti-ship ballistic missile

(ASBM), called “carrier killer,” which carries conventional

warheads to attack overwater ships including aircraft carriers.

The DF-26, which has a range including Guam and is called

“Guam killer,” is considered a “second-generation ASBM”

developed on the basis of the DF-21D. It was announced in

April 2018 that the DF-21D had “formally joined the order of

battle.” China also possesses the CJ-20 (CJ-10) long-range

land-attack cruise missile with a range of at least 1,500 km,

as well as the H-6 bomber that is capable of carrying this

cruise missile. It is deemed that these missiles complement

ballistic missile forces, covering the Indo-Pacifi c region

including Japan. In the military parade to celebrate the 70th

anniversary of its founding in October 2019, CJ-100/DF-100,

which is said to be a supersonic cruise missile, also made

its fi rst public appearance. The deployment of these ASBMs

and cruise missiles is expected to strengthen China’s “A2/

AD” capabilities. Concerning SRBMs, China has deployed a

large number of solid-propellant DF-16, DF-15, and DF-11

missiles facing Taiwan. It is believed that their ranges cover

a part of Japan’s Southwestern Islands including the Senkaku

Islands.

Furthermore, China is believed to be rapidly developing

several HGVs that would be launched with ballistic missiles

to penetrate missile defenses. Their fl ight tests have reportedly

been conducted since 2014. In the military parade to mark

the 70th anniversary of China’s founding in October 2019,

the DF-17 MRBM viewed as capable of carrying a hypersonic

glide vehicle made its fi rst public appearance. In August

2018, China is believed to have tested a hypersonic vehicle

featuring the “waverider” design. These vehicles are said to

be more diffi cult for missiles to intercept, because they fl y

low at very high speeds and are highly maneuverable.

China is also thought to be devoting energies to the

development of missile defense technology. It is believed

to have conducted several tests on midcourse missile

interception technology since 2010. In October 2019,

Russian President Putin noted that Russia was supporting

China’s development of “a missile-attack early warning

system.” Given that ballistic missile defense technology has

the potential to be applied to missiles capable of destroying

satellites, attention will focus on future Chinese missile

defense trends including ballistic missile defense technology

downsizing, multifunctionality, and modularization of

military units. Specifi cally, it is believed to be improving

ground forces’ mobility using measures such as shifting

from theater defense to trans-theater mobility and working

to motorize and mechanize infantry units. China is also

believed to be strengthening its airborne troops (belonging

to the Air Force), amphibious forces belonging to the Army

and Navy, special operations forces, and helicopter units.

China has continued to build up the Navy Marine Corps,

which is expected to have more than 30,000 troops by 2020

and undertake overseas expedition operations in addition to

amphibious assault landing operations and regional defense

in the South China Sea.[7] China undertakes efforts to build

a command system for improving its joint operational

capabilities and operational effi ciency and tackles reforms to

improve its logistical support capabilities.

China has annually conducted Stride, Firepower, and Sharp


The naval forces consist of three fl eets: North Sea Fleet,

East Sea Fleet, and South Sea Fleet. China’s naval forces

are rapidly modernizing, and the Chinese Navy promotes

the mass production of its indigenous Yuan-class submarines

with improved quietness, as well as surface combatant ships

with improved air defense and anti-ship attack capabilities.

In January 2020, the Navy commissioned the fi rst Renhai
class destroyer among its largest destroyers. The Renhai
class destroyer is said to be equipped with a vertical launch

system (VLS) with 112 launch cells, almost twice the

number of launch cells as the new Luyang III-class destroyer.

The VLS is capable of launching long-range land-attack

cruise missiles and YJ-18 anti-ship cruise missiles with a

supersonic terminal attack capability. In addition, the Navy

is increasing the number of large landing ships and supply

ships. Since September 2019, Type-075 large landing ships

have been launched in sequence. Since September 2017,

Fuyu-class fast combat support ships (comprehensive supply

ships) have been in operation for replenishment for the

aircraft carrier group. It has also been pointed out that China

is developing new submarines capable of carrying land
attack cruise missiles.

With regard to aircraft carriers, China’s fi rst aircraft carrier

“Liaoning,” following its commission in September 2012,

reportedly made its fi rst advance to the South China Sea in

November 2013 and to the Pacifi c Ocean in December 2016.

In the same month of 2016, the “Liaoning” conducted its fi rst

comprehensive live action, including live fi ring by carrier
based fi ghters, in the Bohai Sea. It was announced that the

“Liaoning” participated in a naval review in the South China

Sea and advanced to the Pacifi c Ocean for force-on-force

military branch and service exercises under Joint Action since

2014. Furthermore, it has been reported that force-on-force

training has been frequently conducted to improve practical

operational capabilities. These facts suggest China’s attempt

to improve its practical joint operational capabilities.

carrier) was launched in April 2017 and then it was named

Shandong and commissioned in Sanya of Hainan Island

the world s largest maritime law enforcement organizations,
possessing 130 ships with full displacement of 1,000 tons or

more,[8] including two 10,000-ton-class patrol ships, among
the world’s largest ones. Some Coast Guard ships have
been confirmed as armed with 76 mm guns that may be as
powerful as large-diameter guns on naval ships.

The organizational enhancement of the Coast Guard has


also been confirmed. China’s maritime surveillance had been

conducted by the China Coast Guard Bureau under control of

the State Council’s Ministry of Public Security, as a unified

body consisting of the China Marine Surveillance (Haijian)

of the State Oceanic Administration under the Ministry of

Natural Resources, the China Fisheries Law Enforcement

Command (Yuzheng) of the Fisheries Management Bureau

under the Ministry of Agriculture, the Maritime Anti
Smuggling Force of the General Administration of Customs,

etc. In July 2018, the Coast Guard was transferred to the

PAP under unified control and command of the CMC and

renamed PAP Coast Guard. After the transfer, former naval

officers were reportedly given major Coast Guard posts,

indicating enhanced cooperation between the military and

Coast Guard. It has been noted that retired naval destroyers

and frigates were delivered to the Coast Guard, suggesting

that the military has been supporting the Coast Guard in

terms of equipment as well as personnel.

At a ceremony to give the PAP a flag in January 2018,

underwater vehicles (UUVs) that are available for military

purposes. Such equipment, though being relatively cheap,

are viewed as representing an asymmetric force to effectively

prevent adversaries from winning maritime supremacy,

particularly underwater supremacy.

Given these developments concerning the naval forces,

China appears to be steadily building up capabilities for

conducting operations in more distant waters in addition to

near sea defense.
The PAP, one of the China’s armed forces other than the
military, has the Coast Guard as a maritime law enforcement
organization under its umbrella. The Coast Guard consists
of three groups: North, East and South Sea Sub-bureaus.

as well, the Air Force has increased the number of H-6

bombers, which are believed to be capable of carrying long
range land-attack cruise missiles with nuclear capability.

In an attempt to improve bombers’ long-range operation

capabilities, the Air Force has reportedly begun to operate

H-6N bombers that can take advantage of aerial refueling to

fl y longer. It is believed to be developing a new long-range

stealth bomber called H-20. It is also pointed out that China

is developing an air-launched ballistic missile with nuclear

capability to be carried by such bombers, and a stealth fi ghter

bomber.

China is also making continuous efforts to improve

capabilities which are essential for operations of modern

air power by introducing the H-6U and IL-78M aerial

refueling tankers and the KJ-500 and KJ-2000 early warning

and control aircraft. Since July 2016, China has promoted

the deployment of the indigenously developed Y-20 large

transport aircraft, which has reportedly become a base for


Chairman Xi stated that the PAP would be incorporated

into the military forces’ joint operations system. It has been

pointed out that the military forces and the Coast Guard have

conducted joint exercises. The military forces and the PAP

including the Coast Guard are believed to be attempting

to steadily strengthen their joint operational capabilities

through the enhancement of cooperation. Given these trends,

progress in cooperation between the Coast Guard and the

Navy and between the Coast Guard and military services

other than the Navy should be watched closely.

It is pointed out that, among the militia, whose status is

China’s armed force other than the military, the so-called

maritime militia is playing the role of the front guard for

supporting China’s maritime interests. The maritime militia

is said to operate in the South China Sea, etc. and consist

of fi shermen and residents of isolated islands. However,

the details of the maritime militia have not been revealed.

In March 2009, when Chinese naval and other ships

intercepted the Impeccable, a U.S. Navy ocean surveillance

ship, maritime militia members were reportedly seen aboard

a fi shing boat that was trying to remove a sonar from the

U.S. ship. In 2019 when Chinese maritime survey ships were

operating in Vietnam’s exclusive economic zone, maritime

militia ships were reportedly seen along with Chinese

government ships. Given the China’s emphasis on the

necessity of “fully exerting the overall power of the military,

these asymmetrical forces, too.

（5）Air Forces

China’s air forces consist mainly of the Navy’s air units

and the Air Force. As for fourth-generation fi ghters, China

has introduced from Russia the Su-27 and Su-30 and the Su
35 latest fourth-generation fi ghter. China is also developing

its own domestic modern fi ghters. China has started the mass

production of the J-11B fi ghter, a suspected copy of the Su
27, and the J-16 fi ghter, a suspected copy of the Su-30, as

well as the domestic J-10 fi ghter. The J-15 fi ghter aboard the

aircraft carrier “Liaoning” is viewed as a copy of the Russian

Su-33. China has also reportedly begun to deploy the J-20

fi fth-generation fi ghter and been developing the J-31. It has

been pointed out that the J-31 fi ghter could be the base for

developing the replacement for the J-15 carrier-based fi ghter.

China is rapidly developing a variety of domestic


long-endurance (HALE) UAVs for reconnaissance and other

purposes as well as those capable of carrying weapons such as

missiles. Some of these are deployed and actively exported.

In fact, it is suggested that the Chinese Air Force has created

a UAV unit for attack missions and frequently used UAVs

for reconnaissance and other purposes in waters and airspace

surrounding China. At the military parade to celebrate the

70th anniversary of China’s founding in October 2019, the

GJ-11 known as a stealth attack UAV and the WZ-8 claimed

to be a high-altitude, high-speed reconnaissance UAV were

displayed for the first time. It has been noted that China is

improving “Swarm” technology to operate a large number of

small low-cost UAVs.

（6）Space, Cyber, and Electromagnetic Spectrum
Capabilities

Information gathering, and command and communication in

the military sector have increasingly relied on satellites and

computer networks. As such, China stated that “outer space

and cyberspace have become new commanding heights

(capture point) in strategic competition among all parties,”

indicating that it has recognized the importance of taking on

information mastery in wartime when it must protect its own

information systems and networks while neutralizing those

of its adversaries. In fact, the PLASSF established at the end

of 2015 apparently takes charge of outer space, cyberspace,

and electronic warfare missions for intelligence support for

all military forces.


covering both attacks on and defense of command systems.

Cyberattacks on enemy networks are likely to bolster China’s

“A2/AD” capabilities. The militia as a part of China’s armed

forces reportedly includes “cyber militias” with excellent

cyber domain capabilities.

It has also been pointed out that the Chinese military


routinely conducts various force-on-force exercises in an

electronic warfare environment. In addition, the presence of

aircraft with electronic warfare capabilities has been noted.

Y-8 electronic warfare aircraft, which frequently fly near

Japan, are pointed out along with J-15 carrier-based fighters,

J-16 fighters and H-6 bombers that appear to be equipped

with electronic warfare pod systems giving them electronic

warfare capabilities.

（7）Efforts to Develop Joint Operational Capabilities

In recent years, initiatives have been under way to improve

joint operational capabilities in areas from the front line to

logistics. The CMC Joint Operations Command Center is

believed to have been established under the initiatives for

the CCP to carry out decision making at the highest strategic

level. The five new theaters established in February 2016 are

seen as representing permanent joint operation headquarters.

Given that the Navy’s Vice-Admiral Yuan Yubai became the

first non-Army theater commander in January 2017, it is

assumed that progress is being made towards joint operations

in the area of human resources. In recent years, China has

implemented tri-service joint exercises giving priority to

practicality and other drills to improve its joint operational

capabilities. These drills are apparently designed to secure the

effectiveness of the abovementioned organizational reforms

and other initiatives to improve joint operational capabilities.

In response to the novel coronavirus disease, which emerged

in China from late 2019, China has reportedly implemented

not only joint military operations but also the mobilization of

civil resources. The Joint Logistics Support Force specialized

in logistics has played a core military role in the response

while receiving support from each theater and service. In

addition, militias and national-defense-mobilized personnel

have also reportedly participated in the response, which has

attracted attention as a case indicating comprehensive joint


released in December 2016, China does not rule out its use of

outer space for military purposes. Given that administrative

organizations and state-owned enterprises involved in the

use of outer space in China are pointed out as having close

cooperative ties with the military, it is considered that China

is planning to improve its capabilities for military operations

in outer space.[9] China is said to have developed its space

program in the shortest time in the world. Specifically, China

has rapidly increased the number of satellites available

for military purposes in recent years. For example, the

“BeiDou” global satellite positioning system, which is called

a Chinese-version GPS and pointed out as available for

ballistic missiles and other guided weapons systems, started

its global operation service in late 2018 and has reportedly

been continuing to be improved. Moreover, China is thought

to be developing weapons including anti-satellite weapons

using missiles and laser equipment, as well as killer satellites,

in order to restrict and interfere with the use of space-based

assets by adversaries in wartime.[10]

As for the cyber domain, China sees cyber security


as a serious national security threat it faces and vows that

China’s armed forces will build cyber defense capabilities,

reinforce national cyber border defense, immediately find

and block crackers, secure information network security, and

unshakably protect national cyber sovereignty, information

security, and social stability.[11] It has been noted that current

major military exercises always contain cyber operations


logistic support capabilities.

（2）Military Activities in Japan’s Surrounding Waters and
Airspace

The Chinese Navy and Air Force have in recent years
expanded and intensified their activities in the surrounding sea
areas and airspace of Japan, including the area surrounding
the Senkaku Islands. These activities include those allegedly
based on China’s unilateral claim on the Senkaku Islands, and
cases involving the one-sided escalation of activities, creating
a situation of great concern to Japan. The Air Self-Defense
Force (ASDF) has continued to make frequent scrambles
against Chinese aircraft, as indicated by an all-time high of
851 scrambles in FY2016. China has also continued naval
ships’ passage through waters near Japan for navigation to
distant waters such as the Indian Ocean, as well as activities
viewed as training of maritime and air forces making forays
to the Pacific and the Sea of Japan. Although China can be
suspected of intending to “regularize” these activities, there
is a view that China is attempting to take advantage of the

“regularization” to alleviate concerns over these activities.[12]

At the same time, it appears that China continues to improve
the complexity of its activities. Given that Chinese efforts are
also seen to improve practical joint operational capabilities,
Chinese military activities in Japan’s surrounding waters and
airspace should be closely watched with grave attention.

a. Activities in the East China Sea (including the Areas around
the Senkaku Islands)


Given that General Secretary Xi spoke about enhancing

joint operational capabilities at the 19th CCP National

Congress in October 2017 and has reiterated the pursuit of a

military that “can fight and win a war,” the abovementioned

moves towards joint operations are expected to progress

further.


**6** Maritime and Airspace Activities

（1）General Situation


Recently, China is believed to be aiming to build up

capabilities for operations in more distant waters and airspace,

including those to project power to waters including the so
called second island chain, beyond the first island chain. In

such efforts, China has rapidly expanded and intensified its

activities in the maritime and aerial domains using its naval

and air powers. In waters and airspace surrounding Japan,

particularly, Chinese naval vessels, and naval and air force

aircraft suspected as conducting training and information

gathering activities have been observed frequently, along

with Chinese naval ships heading for the Pacific and Indian

Ocean and numerous Chinese Coast Guard ships and

aircraft operating under the name of protecting maritime

interests. Their activities include Chinese government ships’

intermittent intrusions into Japan’s territorial waters, Chinese

aircraft’s intrusions into Japan’s airspace, and dangerous

acts that could cause unintended consequences, such as

the directing of fire-control radar at Japanese Self-Defense

Forces (SDF) ships and aircraft, Chinese military fighter jets’

abnormally close approach to Japanese SDF and U.S. military

aircraft, and the establishment of the “East China Sea ADIZ”

and other activities that could infringe upon the freedom of

overflight. These activities have become a grave matter of

concern and are very deplorable. In the South China Sea,

China is moving forward with militarization, and expanding

and intensifying its activities in the maritime and aerial

domains, attempting to create a fait accompli for unilaterally

changing the status quo by coercion. It is strongly hoped that

China will act on the basis of the principle of the rule of

law and play active roles in the region and the international

community in a more cooperative manner.


**Chapter**


Chinese naval vessels have been conducting operations

in the East China Sea continuously and actively. Stating

its own position regarding Japan’s Senkaku Islands, China

claims that patrols by Chinese naval vessels in the sea areas

under its jurisdiction are completely justifiable and lawful.

Chinese naval vessels have been continuously operating

in the areas near Japan’s Senkaku Islands. In June 2016, a

Jiangkai I-class frigate became the first ever Chinese Navy

combatant vessel to enter Japan’s contiguous zone around

the Senkaku Islands. Furthermore, in January 2018, a Shang
class submerged submarine and a Jiangkai II-class frigate

passed into the contiguous zone around the Senkaku Islands

on the same day. This was the first time a submerged Chinese

submarine was identified and announced as transiting


through the contiguous waters off the Senkaku Islands.

In recent years, Chinese Navy intelligence gathering

vessels (AGIs) have also been found conducting activities

in multiple cases. A Chinese Navy Dongdiao-class AGI


12 According to Taiwan’s 2009 National Defense Report


-----

repeatedly navigated back and forth outside of the contiguous

zone south of the Senkaku Islands in November 2015. In June

2016, an AGI of the same type sailed in Japan’s territorial

waters near Kuchinoerabujima Island and Yakushima

Island, and then passed Japan’s contiguous zone north of

Kitadaitojima Island. Subsequently, the vessel repeatedly

conducted east-west passages outside the contiguous zone

south of the Senkaku Islands. This was the first navigation

by a Chinese Navy vessel in Japanese territorial waters in the

approximately 12 years since 2004.

China’s air forces are also actively conducting activities

in the East China Sea on a routine basis. Their activities

are thought to include warning and surveillance, combat

air patrols (CAPs), and training. Chinese military aircraft

have recently become more active in airspace closer to

Japan’s Southwestern Islands. Their activities have possibly

been intended to operate the “East China Sea ADIZ.”

In April 2018, an alleged Chinese BZK-005 unmanned

reconnaissance vehicle was identified flying over the East

China Sea. Furthermore, Chinese military aircraft have been

confirmed as operating in airspace close to the Senkaku

Islands in recent years.

b. Advancements into the Pacific Ocean

Chinese Navy combatant vessels continue to transit the

waters near Japan to advance into the Pacific Ocean and

return to base with high frequency. The advancement routes

are multiplying. Chinese naval vessels have been confirmed

as transiting the sea area between the main island of Okinawa

and Miyakojima Island, and have been found passing

through the Osumi Strait, the sea area between Yonagunijima

Island and Nakanokamishima Island near Iriomotejima

Island, the sea area between Amamioshima Island and

Yokoatejima Island, the Tsugaru Strait, and the Soya Strait.

Through these activities, China has apparently attempted

to “regularize” naval ships’ advancements into the Pacific

Ocean through waters near Japan and improve its capabilities

for accessing the open ocean and conducting operations

there. In December 2016, the aircraft carrier “Liaoning”

navigated the East China Sea together with other vessels and

passed the sea area between the main island of Okinawa and

Miyakojima Island to advance to the Pacific for the first time.

In April 2018, the Chinese Ministry of National Defense

announced that the aircraft carrier “Liaoning” and multiple

other vessels passed through the Bashi Channel to advance


to the Pacific and conducted force-on-force exercises that

included carrier-based fighters. At that time, the Japanese

Maritime Self-Defense Force (MSDF), conducting warning

and surveillance, confirmed for the first time the carrier

used for what were presumed to be carrier-based fighters

for take-off and landing in the Pacific Ocean. Moreover, the

aircraft carrier “Liaoning” advanced to the Pacific Ocean

through the sea area between the main island of Okinawa

and Miyakojima island in June 2019, together with vessels

such as a Fuyu-class fast combat support ship pointed out to

be for supplying the aircraft carrier group. Furthermore, in

April 2020, a fleet, including the aircraft carrier “Liaoning,”

passed through the waters of the main island of Okinawa and

Miyakojima island to enter the Pacific Ocean, and deployed

through the Bashi Strait to the South China Sea. Later, the

fleet again passed through the Bashi Strait and entered the

Pacific Ocean. Within the same month it passed through

the waters of the main island of Okinawa and Miyakojima

island to the East China Sea. In this voyage, carrier-based

fighters have been seen taking-off and landing in the Pacific

too. The activities are worthy of attention as indicating the

enhancement of the capabilities of China’s naval forces,

including the aircraft carrier, and the improvement of its

capabilities to project power to more distant areas. Given a

Chinese nuclear-powered submarine’s submerged passage

through Japan’s territorial waters around the Sakishima

Islands in November 2004 and a Chinese Navy Shang-class

submarine’s submerged passage from the Pacific Ocean

toward the East China Sea through Japan’s contiguous zone

northeast of Miyakojima Island in January 2018, it is thought

that Chinese submarines also have conducted some activities

in the Pacific.

Regarding air forces, the advancement of a PLAN Y-8

early warning aircraft into the Pacific Ocean, passing between

the main island of Okinawa and Miyakojima Island, was

confirmed for the first time in July 2013. The advancement of

Air Force aircraft into the Pacific was also confirmed in 2015.

Since 2017, advances into the Pacific Ocean via this airspace

have become more active. The types of aircraft passing

through the airspace have also diversified year by year. H-6K

bombers and Su-30 fighters were confirmed by 2016 and the

first Y-8 EW aircraft in July 2017. At least one bomber was

confirmed as carrying objects in the form of missiles. The

U.S. DoD has pointed out that such Chinese bomber flights


**Chapter**


-----

indicated the Chinese forces training targeting the United

States and its allies.[13] Flight patterns of Chinese military

aircraft have also been changing. Flights from the East China

Sea to the Pacific Ocean, passing between the main island of

Okinawa and Miyakojima Island, and from the direction of

the Bashi Channel to the Pacific Ocean, both with the return

trips on the same shuttle routes, have been repeatedly made.

Since November 2016, H-6K bombers and other aircraft

were confirmed as flying around Taiwan. In August 2017,

H-6K bombers were confirmed as flying to waters off the

Kii Peninsula after advancing to the Pacific Ocean via waters

between the main island of Okinawa and Miyakojima Island.

Through frequent long-distance flights of bombers and other

aircraft, including advancements to the Pacific, and their

advanced flight paths and composition, China is thought to

be demonstrating its presence around areas including those

surrounding Japan, and planning further enhancements to

more practical operational capabilities.

Additionally, activities considered planned to improve

sea and air joint operational capabilities in more distant

areas, such as what seemed to be air-to-ship attack drills

including advancements to the Pacific Ocean, have been seen

in recent years. In April 2019 and February 2020, the PLA

Eastern Theater Command announced that joint training was

conducted in waters east of Taiwan. China is expected to

further expand and intensify naval and air activities in the

Pacific Ocean.

c. Activities in the Sea of Japan

**Chapter**


Since 2018, China’s sea and air forces have further

intensified activities in the Sea of Japan involving passages

through the Tsushima Strait. It is considered that the PLA

will continue to expand and intensify its activities in the Sea

of Japan.


（3）Activities of Chinese Ships Including Government
Vessels, and Aircraft around the Senkaku Islands, etc.

Chinese government vessels have been seen almost every

day in the contiguous zone of the Senkaku Islands, Japan’s

inherent territory, and intruded into Japan’s territorial waters

around the islands three times a month on average. Despite

Japan’s strong protests, they continued to intrude into the

Japanese territorial waters in FY2019. In May 2020, Chinese

government vessels entered Japan’s territorial waters around

the Senkaku Islands for three consecutive days. From May 9

to 10, they continued to cruise in Japan’s territorial waters for

more than 26 hours and approached and followed a Japanese

fishing boat.


While the Chinese Navy has been active in the Sea of Japan

during training and on other occasions for some time, its

Air Force activities in the area have also intensified of late.

“Force-on-force exercises” in the Sea of Japan by Chinese

Navy ships were announced for the first time in August

2016. Three aircraft apparently participated in the exercises,

including two H-6 bombers that passed through the Tsushima

Strait into the Sea of Japan for the first time.

In December 2017, Chinese Air Force aircraft (H-6K


In December 2008, China Maritime Surveillance vessels

intruded into Japan’s territorial waters and hovered and

drifted, running counter to international law. Later, China

Maritime Surveillance and China Fisheries Law Enforcement

Command vessels gradually intensified their activities

in the Japanese territorial waters. Such activities have

intensified greatly since September 2012, when the Japanese

Government acquired the ownership of three of the Senkaku

Islands (Uotsurishima Island, Kitakojima Island, and

Minamikojima Island). The number of Chinese government

ships intruding into the Japanese territorial waters in a day

had been limited to two or three until August 2016. Later,


bombers) passed through the Tsushima Strait and advanced

to the Sea of Japan for the first time. Then, Chinese fighter

-----

China is seen to be steadily strengthening an operational

posture intended to use government vessels to intrude into

Japan’s territorial waters. Specifi cally, government vessels

sent to waters near the Senkaku Islands have grown larger

in size. At least one of the government vessels intruding into

Japan’s territorial waters has been a 3,000-ton or larger vessel

since August 2014. Since February 2015, three 3,000-ton or

larger government vessels have been confi rmed as entering

Japan’s territorial waters simultaneously. Since December

2015, Chinese government ships armed with what appear

to be cannons have repeatedly intruded into the Japanese

territorial waters.

Cases indicating the improvement of Chinese government

vessels’ operational capabilities have been also confi rmed.

From April to June 2019, Chinese government vessels were

seen in the contiguous zone of the Senkaku Islands for

a record 64 consecutive days. In that year, the number of

days when Chinese government vessels were seen in the

contiguous zone of the Senkaku Islands hit an all-time high

of 282. The total number of Chinese government vessels

seen in the zone also reached an all-time high of 1,097.

Additionally, cases indicating China’s capabilities to send


numerous government vessels to waters around the Senkaku

Islands simultaneously have also been identifi ed. In early

August 2016, approximately 200 to 300 Chinese fi shing boats

advanced to the contiguous zone of the Senkaku Islands. At

that time, as many as up to 15 Chinese government vessels

were confi rmed in the contiguous zone simultaneously. Over

fi ve days, a large number of Chinese government vessels

and fi shing boats repeatedly intruded into Japan’s territorial

waters.

In December 2012, a fi xed-wing aircraft of the State

Oceanic Administration was identifi ed as the fi rst Chinese

aircraft to intrude into Japan’s airspace around the Senkaku

Islands. Until March 2014, aircraft of the State Oceanic

Administration were frequently confi rmed as approaching

the airspace. In May 2017, it was confi rmed that an object

that appeared to be a small drone was fl ying above a Chinese

government vessel intruding into the Japanese territorial

waters around the Senkaku Islands. This fl ight also constitutes

an invasion of Japan’s territorial airspace.

China has thus relentlessly continued attempts to

for military purposes, including runways, ports, hangars, and

radar facilities, to militarize these features.

On Fiery Cross, Subi and Mischief Reefs, called the Big


Islands, Chinese government vessels were confirmed as

passing through the territorial waters of Japan around

Tsushima Island (Nagasaki Prefecture), Okinoshima Island

(Fukuoka Prefecture) and the Tsugaru Strait in July 2017.

The same vessels were also confirmed to have sailed in

Japan’s territorial waters from Sata Cape to the Kusagaki

Islands (both in Kagoshima Prefecture) in August that year.

In July 2019, a Chinese government vessel was seen sailing

in Japan’s territorial waters around Tappisaki and Omasaki

(both in Aomori Prefecture).


Three of the Spratly Islands, China has developed batteries

for anti-aircraft guns, missile shelters, underground storage

facilities pointed out to be munitions storage, large ports

capable of accommodating combatant ships and runways

available for takeoff and landing of fighters and bombers.

On Fiery Cross Reef in April 2016, a Navy patrol aircraft

flying over the South China Sea landed for a nominal

purpose of evacuating emergency patients. On Subi and

Mischief Reefs in July of the same year, China forced

aircraft test flights on runways available for the takeoff and

landing of large aircraft. Reportedly, a Y-7 transport aircraft

was confirmed on Mischief Reef in January 2018 and a

Y-8 special mission aircraft on Subi Reef in April that year.

Additionally, in April 2018, it was reported that anti-ship

cruise missiles and surface-to-air missiles were deployed on

Fiery Cross, Subi and Mischief Reefs for military training

and that radar jamming systems were deployed on Mischief

Reef. Furthermore, it was reported in May 2020 that China

possibly deployed aircraft including Y-8 patrol and Y-9 early

warning aircraft and other aircraft to the Fiery Cross Reef

in rotation. On the other four features, it is pointed out that

the construction of facilities, such as harbors, helipads, and

radars, has made progress and that what appears to be large

anti-aircraft guns and close in weapon systems (CIWS) may

have already been deployed. If these features are used for

full-scale military purposes, it could significantly change the

security environment in the Indo-Pacific region.

（4）Trends of Activities in the South China Sea

China has also been intensifying its activities based on its

own assertions in the South China Sea, including waters

around the Spratly Islands and the Paracel Islands, over

which territorial disputes exist with neighbors, including

some member states of the Association of Southeast Asian

Nations (ASEAN).


before that of the Spratly Islands. China has reportedly

extended the runway to nearly 3,000 m on Woody Island

since 2013. In October 2015, October 2017, and June

2019, China was reported to have deployed J-11, J-10 and

other fighters on the island. In February 2016 and January

2017, the existence of equipment likely to be surface-to-air

missiles was confirmed. It has been noted that the takeoff and

landing training of the H-6K bombers in the South China Sea

announced by the Chinese Ministry of National Defense in

May 2018 was carried out on Woody Island.

In recent years, Chinese vessels have allegedly been

conducting what are likely to be survey activities in

Scarborough Shoal, where a standoff took place between

Chinese and Philippine government ships in April 2012. It


Since 2014, on seven features of the Spratly Islands (Fiery

Cross Reef, Mischief Reef, Subi Reef, Cuarteron Reef,

Gaven Reefs, Hughes Reef, and Johnson South Reef), China

pressed ahead with large-scale and rapid land reclamation.

The Philippines-China arbitration award issued in July

2016 denied the “historic rights” as the basis of the “nine
dash line” claimed by China, and determined the illegality

of China’s activities such as land reclamation. However,

China has made it clear that it would not comply with the

award and is currently continuing military activities while

promoting the development of military facilities, such as

batteries, and various kinds of infrastructure that can be used


-----

is pointed out that new land reclamations on the shoal might

be seen in the future.[14] It is also pointed out that if China

conducts land reclamations and installs radar facilities,

runways, and other infrastructure on Scarborough Shoal, it

could possibly increase its ability for situation awareness and

power projection capabilities in the surrounding sea area and

ultimately enhance its operational capabilities throughout all

the areas of the South China Sea. Attention must continue to

be paid to the situation going forward.


the China-Russia bilateral naval exercise Joint Sea 2016

was conducted for the fi rst time in the South China Sea. A

fi eld training exercise by naval vessels including the aircraft

carrier “Liaoning” and a naval review ceremony, regarded as

the largest since the founding of China, were conducted in the

same area from the end of March until April 2018. In 2019,

anti-ship ballistic missile tests were reportedly conducted in

the South China Sea for the fi rst time. In 2019 and in April

2020, the deployment of the aircraft carrier “Liaoning”

accompanied by Fuyu-class fast combat support and other

ships in the South China Sea was reported. Furthermore,

Chinese government vessels reportedly fi red warning shots

at fi shing boats of neighboring countries. When Chinese

government vessels interrupted Vietnam’s oil and natural

gas development within its exclusive economic zone from

July to October 2019, they reportedly visited Fiery Cross

Reef for supply. In this way, it appears that China seeks to

expand its military and other forms of presence and enhance

war-sustaining and other joint operational capabilities in the


The activities in sea and airspace are expanding and

intensifying as well. In March 2009, December 2013

and September 2018, Chinese naval and other vessels

May 2017, PLA fi ghters allegedly fl ew close to U.S. Forces

Such activities conducted by China based on its own

assertions unilaterally change the status quo and further


-----

advance its efforts to create a fait accompli. Japan is deeply

concerned about these activities, and the concern is shared

with the international community, including the United

States and other G7 Member States. China asserts that some

of the ASEAN member states including the Philippines and

Vietnam are illegitimately occupying features. However,

China’s development work on the features is of a scale

incomparable to the activities carried out by other countries

and is conducted at a rapid pace.[15]

In any case, the issues surrounding the South China Sea

are directly related to peace and stability in the Indo-Pacifi c

region and are a legitimate concern not only for Japan, which

has major sea lanes in the South China Sea, but also for

the entire international community. Countries concerned,

including China, are urged to refrain from unilateral actions

that heighten tension and act on the basis of the principle of

the rule of law.

in international counter-piracy efforts. In December 2019, the

Chinese Navy conducted its fi rst multilateral exercise with

its Russian and Iranian counterparts in the northern Indian

Ocean. Activities of Chinese Navy submarines have also

been confi rmed continuously in the Indian Ocean. They have

been reported to make port calls at Sri Lanka’s Colombo,

Pakistan’s Karachi, and Malaysia’s Kota Kinabalu. In

January 2020, China reportedly sent a submarine for drills

with Pakistan in the northern Arabian Sea.

Chinese forces have expanded activities not only in the

Indian Ocean but also in other waters. In September 2016,

China-Russia “Joint Sea” bilateral naval exercises took place

in waters including the Mediterranean Sea. In November

2019, the Chinese Navy conducted its fi rst multilateral

exercises with its Russian and South African counterparts

in waters around the Cape of Good Hope. China has also

deployed a space observation support ship in the southern

Pacifi c and dispatched a military hospital ship to waters

including the southern Pacifi c as well as those near Latin

America under “Mission Harmony.”


**Chapter**


（5）Trends in the Indian Ocean and Other More Distant
Waters

The Chinese Navy is considered to be shifting towards

“protection missions on the far seas” and has been steadily

increasing its capabilities to conduct operations in more

distant waters, such as the Indian Ocean, in recent years.

Progress has been seen in the Navy’s development of such

equipment as large combatant ships and replenishment

ships and in its operational initiatives. For example, since

December 2008, Chinese Navy vessels have been deployed

off the coast of Somalia and in the Gulf of Aden to take part


In September 2015, fi ve Chinese military vessels

reportedly sailed in the high seas of the Bering Sea and in

U.S. territorial waters near the Aleutian Islands. Moreover,

in January 2018, China published a white paper entitled

“China’s Arctic Policy,” which mapped out a policy of active

involvement in Arctic initiatives, including efforts to build

a “Polar Silk Road” through the development of Arctic sea

routes. It is pointed out that China could take advantage of

scientifi c survey and commercial activities to increase its

presence including military activities in the Arctic sea.[16]

Additionally, China has been remarkably trying to secure


overseas outposts such as harbors, which would help support

its operations in far seas. For example, in August 2017, China


China-Russia-South Africa Joint Naval Exercise (November 2019)

**Column** “Belt and Road” Initiative

A concept for an economic sphere proposed by

President Xi Jinping. The “Silk Road Economic Belt”

(“One Belt”) and the “21st Century Maritime Silk Road”

(“One Road”) were announced in September and

October 2013, respectively. Since then, the two concepts

are collectively referred to as the “Belt and Road”

Initiative.


15 According to “The Asia-Pacifi c Maritime Security Strategy” U.S. DoD (August 2015).

began to operate a support base for logistics support of the

PLA in Djibouti, a strategic point in Eastern Africa facing the

Gulf of Aden. Since April 2018, a pier viewed as potentially

accommodating large replenishment ships has been under

construction on the “support base” coast. In recent years,

China has been promoting its “Belt and Road” Initiative

(BRI) whose main purpose is advertised as establishing an

economic zone in regions including the Eurasian continent,

with the Chinese military possibly taking on the role of the

shield behind the initiative by such means as the stabilization

of areas via counter-piracy activities and the improvement

of counter-terrorism capabilities in coastal states through

bilateral and multilateral exercises. While it is thought that

the initiative includes a strategic intention to expand its

influence in the region, it is possible that the initiative will

further improve the PLA’s operational capabilities in the

Indian Ocean, Pacific Ocean and elsewhere. For example,

China’s support for the construction of port infrastructure

in Pakistan, Sri Lanka, Bangladesh and other Indian Ocean

countries as well as Pacific island countries including

Vanuatu could lead China to secure outposts available for its

military purposes.


of force in waters and airspace surrounding these islands.

Such activities are considered to also have the purpose of

creating a fait accompli as part of the reasons for unilaterally

changing the status quo and justifying China’s claims based

on its own concept of “legal warfare.”

The fourth is to acquire, maintain, and protect its maritime

rights and interests. China is engaged in oil and gas drilling

as well as building facilities and surveying in the East and

South China Seas. It has been confirmed that in addition to

the existing four platforms, China has built 12 additional

offshore platforms on the Chinese side of the Japan-China

median line of the East China Sea since June 2013. In late

June 2016, the installment of an anti-surface vessel radar

and a surveillance camera was confirmed on one of the

platforms. Attention is to be paid to matters regarding the

platforms, including the purpose of such equipment. Japan

has repeatedly lodged protests against China’s unilateral

development and demanded the termination of such work.

The fifth is to defend its sea lanes of communications. In

the background is the fact that its sea lanes, including its oil

transportation routes from the Middle East, are essential for

the Chinese economy. Given the recent strengthening of the

Chinese Navy and Air Force, it is believed that they have

been expanding military capabilities to cover distant waters

beyond China’s near seas.

Given these objectives of China’s water and airspace

activities and recent trends, it is believed that China plans to

further expand the sphere of its activities, and further intensify

its operations in waters surrounding Japan, including the

East China Sea and the Pacific Ocean, as well as in the South

China Sea and the Indian Ocean.


**Chapter**


（6）Objectives of Activities in Waters and Airspace

The development and activities of Chinese naval and

air forces, descriptions in defense white papers, China’s

geographical conditions and globalizing economy, and other

factors indicate that the recent water and airspace activities

of the Navy, Air Force and other Chinese organizations have

the following objectives:

The first is to intercept operations by adversaries in waters

and airspace as far as possible from China in order to defend

its territorial land, waters and airspace. Behind this objective

is an increase in the effectiveness of long-range attacks due


Meanwhile, in recent years, China has shown interest in

taking steps to avoid and prevent unexpected contingencies

in sea areas and airspace. For example, in April 2014, China,

together with other countries such as Japan and the United

States, adopted the Code for Unplanned Encounters at Sea

(CUES), which sets forth the standards of behavior in the

case that the naval vessels or aircraft of the Western Pacific

Naval Symposium (WPNS) member states have unexpected

encounters. Also, in June 2018, Japan and China started the

implementation of their Maritime and Air Communication

Mechanism between the Defense Authorities to avoid

unexpected collisions between SDF and PLA vessels and

aircraft.


to recent progress in science and technology.

The second is to develop capabilities to deter and prevent

Taiwan’s independence. China maintains that it will not allow

any foreign intervention in solving the Taiwan issue and

realizing the unification of China. To ensure the prevention

of foreign intervention in the Taiwan issue, China needs to

enhance its operational capabilities at sea and airspace as

Taiwan is surrounded by the sea in all directions.

The third is to weaken the control of other countries on

islands subject to China’s territorial claims and enhance

the claims through various surveillance activities and use


-----

including distant ones, as well as night-time exercises and

joint exercises with other countries, in order to strengthen its

operational capabilities. The new military training regulations

in effect since January 2018 referred to the execution of joint

and full-spectrum operation based on network information

systems, in addition to the definite implementation of practical

training as a principle. Moreover, the trial regulation on the

supervision of military training that took effect in March

2019 is regarded as China’s first attempt to put in place a

system that prescribes measures for rectifying practices that

are inconsistent with the requirements of actual combat and

criteria for identifying malpractice and discipline violations

during military training.

In the education spectrum as well, the PLA aims to train


**7** International Military Activities

In recent years, the PLA has been indicating its positive

attitude on nontraditional security missions such as

peacekeeping, humanitarian assistance and disaster relief,

and counterpiracy, dispatching numerous units for such


overseas missions.

China has vowed to consistently support and actively

participate in UN PKO, increasing its presence in UN PKO.

According to the Chinese UN delegation, China has sent more

than 40,000 military personnel to UN PKO (as of February

20, 2020). According to the UN, as of the end of January 2020,

China had a total of 2,544 troops, civilian police and military

observers — the largest number of peacekeepers among the

permanent members of the UN Security Council — engaged

in UN peacekeeping activities, including the United Nations

Multidimensional Integrated Stabilization Mission in Mali

(MINUSMA). China has also largely increased its share of

the UN PKO budget. The Chinese share has remained the

second largest, after the U.S. share, since 2016.


**Chapter**


soldiers who have the ability to execute joint operations.

In 2003, it launched a human resource strategy project

to develop human resources capable of directing joint

and informatized operations, and of building joint and

informatized armed forces. It was reported in 2017 that the

PLA National Defense University began training to develop

human resources capable of directing joint operations.

China outlined the promotion of the “rule of law” at the

fourth plenary session of the 18th CCP Central Committee

in 2014, with Chairman Xi referring to the military as

being controlled by law, indicating that the PLA is required

to thoroughly implement the “rule of law.” In another

development for the indication, Miao Hua, Director of the

Political Work Department, and Zhang Shengmin, Secretary

of the Central Commission for Discipline Inspection,

were selected as members of the 19th Central Military

Commission, the supreme decision-making body in the

military. The issuance of the trial regulation on military

supervision work in January 2020 also suggests the rule of

law promotion.


Moreover, China has been actively participating in


counter-piracy activities off the coast of Somalia and in the

Gulf of Aden as well as humanitarian assistance and disaster

relief activities. In 2011, in view of the deteriorating situation

in Libya, China carried out a military evacuation of Chinese

nationals for the first time.

It is pointed out that factors behind such Chinese attitude


include the growing need for protecting and promoting

China’s national interests overseas following the expansion

of national interests beyond its national borders, China’s

attempt to verify military capabilities including units’

long-distance deployment, its intent to raise its status by

demonstrating its will to fulfill its responsibilities to the

China has been developing defense mobilization systems

in order to effectively utilize private resources in case of

emergencies, including wars. It enforced the National Defense

Mobilization Law as the basic law for defense mobilizations

in 2010 and the National Defense Transportation Law for

the transportation area in 2016. The “civil-military fusion”

policy that China is currently promoting is believed to

have its sights set on the routine military use of civilian

resources not only in emergencies but also in peacetime.

The military use of civilian resources includes civilian ships’

transportation of military equipment. As such initiative

places emphasis on the enhancement of its military industrial
sector, including the domestic production of equipment, to
modernize its military. It has been pointed out that China
is acquiring technologies ambitiously not only through
domestic technology research and development and foreign
direct investment, but also via illegal means in the form of

secret information theft.[18] The trend of the national defense
industry sector is directly linked to the modernization of the
military and should be closely watched with strong attention.

China’s civil-military fusion policy has been evident in

Under the State Administration of Science, Technology and

Industry for National Defense (SASTIND) of the Ministry

of Industry and Information Technology, a department of

the State Council, China’s main national defense industry

had consisted of 12 corporations to develop and produce

nuclear weapons, missiles and rockets, aircraft, vessels,

information systems and other military equipment. The

Chinese national defense industry’s arms sales were pointed

out as the second largest after those in the United States in

2017.[17] After China State Shipbuilding Corporation merged

with China Shipbuilding Industry Corporation in 2019, the

industry now comprises 11 corporations including China

exchanges where military technologies are utilized for

developing the national economy while civilian technologies

are absorbed for national defense development. It also

seems interested in absorbing foreign technologies available

both for military and civilian purposes. It is pointed out

that China’s civil-military fusion policy gives priority to

initiatives in seas, outer space, cyber, AI, and other emerging

areas for China.

In recent years, China has reportedly promoted the

standardization of civilian products for their military

adoption from the production stage under the civil-military

fusion policy. This initiative is expected to allow the military

to more effectively utilize civilian resources.

**3** Relations with the United States


There are various issues between the United States and China,

such as trade issues, issues concerning the South China Sea,

the Taiwan issue, the Hong Kong issue, and human rights

issues regarding Uighur and Tibet. However, China deems

its relationship with the United States as one of the world’s

most important bilateral relationships and appears to be

aware that a stable U.S.-China relationship is essential in

enhancing its national power, including the development

of its economy. Accordingly, it is likely that China is trying

to further develop relations with the United States through

mutual respect and “win-win” cooperation. At the same time,

however, it must be noted that China has indicated its attitude

of making no compromise regarding its “core interests and

major concerns.” Recently, the moves of the United States

and China keeping each other in check have been attracting

strong attention.

Since the start of the Trump administration, the United


Security Treaty applies to the Senkaku Islands. This was

confirmed in a document between the Japanese and U.S.

leaders for the first time in February 2017, in the joint

statement from the first Japan-U.S. Summit Meeting since the

inauguration of the Trump administration, which explicitly

referred to the application of Article 5 of the Treaty to the

Senkaku Islands. China has shown its strong protest against

these stances. With regard to the issues over the South China

Sea, the United States is concerned about such dimensions

as obstruction to the freedom of navigation in sea lanes,

restrictions on the activities of U.S. Forces, and the worsening

security situation in the entire region. The United States has

requested China to comply with international norms, and

has repeatedly criticized China’s unilateral and assertive

actions. And the United States also implements the Freedom

of Navigation Operation in the South China Sea and other

waters to counter excessive claims to maritime interests by

other countries such as China and calls for demilitarizing the

South China Sea.

While embracing these differences, the United States and


States has made frequent statements on the necessity of

cooperation between the United States and China on issues

such as North Korea. At the same time, it also called on

China to uphold international rules and norms on global

issues, including international trade and maritime security.

Amid this situation, the Trump administration has been

toughening its stance on China since June 2018 through such

measures as the phased raising of tariffs, on the grounds of

China’s unfair trade practices over many years. China has

also responded with countermeasures such as the phased

raising of tariffs. In January 2020, however, the United States

and China reached the Phase 1 deal, which places China’s

expansion of import volumes from the United States as a

20 A di t “U it d St t N ti l D f St t ” (J 2018)


China apparently continued military exchanges in a relatively

stable manner. As seen in China’s response to the U.S. DoD’s

notification of arms sales to Taiwan to Congress, for example,

China has recently indicated restrained responses to the


-----

United States. In April 2008, a hotline between the defense

authorities of the two countries was set up. In November

2014 and September 2015, the United States and China

announced that they agreed on confidence-building measures

aimed at reducing the risk of unintended encounters. China

has also dispatched observers to U.S. military exercises, and

exercises have been conducted between the Chinese and U.S.

navies on the occasions of mutual port visits. In addition, the

U.S. and Chinese forces have engaged in annual humanitarian

and disaster relief exercises since November 2013. After the

inauguration of the Trump administration, both countries

frequently mentioned the importance of bilateral military

exchanges, and a series of new dialogue frameworks were

launched, including the “Diplomatic and Security Dialogue”

and the “Joint Staff Dialogue Mechanism.”

However, there are movements which indicate changes

in the military exchanges that have remained rather stable

in recent years. The second dialogue under the Joint Staff

Dialogue Mechanism, which was due to take place in

September 2018, was reportedly postponed. Moreover, the

U.S. Defense Authorization Act for FY2019, which includes

a clause to prohibit the United States from inviting China to

RIMPAC until the demilitarization of the South China Sea is

achieved, was enacted. And the United States decided not to

send its vessels to the International Fleet Review that China

hosted in April 2019.


the two countries came to a settlement. The two countries

have a common view on promoting the multipolarization of

the world and the establishment of a new international order

and have further deepened their relations.

On the military front, since the 1990s, China has

purchased modern weapons from Russia, including fighters,

destroyers, and submarines. Russia is currently the largest

supplier of weapons to China.[21] Although China-Russia arms

transactions in value in recent years have been lower than in

some past period, China has apparently continued to indicate

its strong interests in importing advanced Russian defense

equipment and in joint equipment development with Russia.

For example, China has introduced what are believed to be

the latest fourth generation Su-35 fighters and the S-400

surface-to-air missile system from Russia. China has been

reported as the first country to import the Russian S-400

missile system. At the same time, it is pointed out that Russia

has differentiated the performance of some of the weapons it

exports to China, due to its concerns about China’s reverse

engineering and its policy of not providing China having

a ground border with Russia with sophisticated weapons

that would pose a threat to Russia. It is also suggested that

Russia has concerns about competing with China in arms

exports taking into consideration China’s improvement of

technological power.

Military exchanges between China and Russia take place


**Chapter**


While wanting a better relationship with China, the United

States has demonstrated an uncompromising stance on

matters concerning its own security. Developments in U.S.
China relations will continue to require close monitoring

with keen attention.

While the United States has mentioned the need for a

framework including China to control missile forces, China

denies its involvement.


in such forms as routine mutual visits by senior military

officers and bilateral and multilateral exercises. For example,

China participated in the Vostok 2018 exercise, viewed as

one of the largest Russian military exercises since the end of

the Cold War, and in the Tsentr-2019 exercise. Additionally,

the two countries have held the large-scale bilateral naval

exercise “Joint Sea” since 2012. The annual exercise for

2016 took place in the South China for the first time, and

that for 2017 was held in the Baltic Sea and Sea of Okhotsk

for the first time. In 2016 and 2017, the two countries

held the “Aerospace Security” missile defense computer
simulated exercise. Furthermore, China has held the counter
terrorism exercise “Peace Mission” between China and

Russia or among the member countries of the Shanghai

Cooperation Organization (SCO), established in June 2001

including Russia. China likely regards these exchanges as

an opportunity to learn about how to operate Russian-made

weapons and the operational doctrine of the Russian Armed


**4** Relations with Russia

Ever since the so-called China-Soviet confrontation ended

in 1989, China and Russia have placed importance on their

bilateral relationship. They have emphasized the deepening

of their “strategic partnership” since its establishment in

the mid-1990s. In 2001, the China-Russia Treaty of Good
Neighborliness and Friendly Cooperation was concluded. In

2004, the long-standing issue of border demarcation between

In addition, moves indicating deepened China-Russia

relations have been confirmed in recent years. In the two

countries’ “first joint strategic flight” of bombers in July

2019, their bombers joined in the Sea of Japan and flew to

the East China Sea. In September 2019, China and Russia

signed a series of documents on cooperation in the military

and military technologies.[22]

**5** Relations with North Korea


ASEAN Plus Three (Japan, China and the ROK), East

Asia Summit (EAS) and ASEAN Regional Forum (ARF).

Furthermore, China has developed bilateral relations through

infrastructure development support, etc. under the BRI.

On the military front, there seems to be moves that China

has made efforts toward military confidence building, such

as the first ASEAN-China Maritime Field Training Exercise,

which took place in October 2018. Recently, the PLA’s

attempt to secure an outpost for its activities in Cambodia has

been reported, although the countries concerned denied this.

In July 2016, an arbitration award based on the United

Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea (UNCLOS)

adjudicating the Philippines’ case against China in the South

China Sea was rendered, accepting most of the Philippine

claims. After that, the Philippines was said to have refrained

from referring to the arbitration award because of China’s

substantial economic support and pressure. In September

2019, however, a Philippine Presidential Office spokesperson

noted that the arbitration award was still a subject in bilateral

talks. In April 2019, the Philippines announced a protest

statement against China over massive Chinese fishing boats

confirmed as near Thitu Island under effective Philippine

control among the Spratly Islands.[23]

In July 2017 and March 2018, the Vietnamese government

reportedly made foreign companies, engaged in oil drilling in

the South China Sea with the permission of the Vietnamese

government, cancel the drilling under the pressure from

China. Chinese and Vietnamese government ships staged a

standoff over oil and natural gas drilling within Vietnam’s

exclusive economic zone from July 2019 until Vietnam

withdrew its HAKRYU-5 drilling rig in October of that year

to end the standoff.


China has kept close relations with North Korea under the

1961 Sino-North Korean Mutual Aid and Cooperation

Friendship Treaty. Although Chinese and North Korean

leaders’ reciprocal visits have been viewed as decreasing

since North Korea’s transition to the Kim Jong-un regime,

Xi Jinping in June 2019 became the first Chinese president to

visit North Korea in 14 years and held his fifth meeting with

Chairman Kim.

China has reportedly adopted three principles on the

Korea Peninsula – (1) the denuclearization of the Korean

Peninsula, (2) the maintenance of peace and stability on

the Korean Peninsula, and (3) the resolution of problems

through dialogue and consultations – indicating that China

gives priority to the maintenance of stability and dialogue

as well as the denuclearization. Under these principles,

China, while agreeing to UN Security Council resolutions to

enhance sanctions on North Korea, cooperated with Russia

in distributing a draft resolution including a proposal to lift

some of the UN sanctions at the council in December 2019.

Although China has vowed to have seriously observed its

international obligations, it has been pointed out that Chinese

ships have been involved in illegal ship-to-ship transfer that

has been banned by the UN Security Council resolutions on

North Korean sanctions.

Indonesia has had frequent disputes with China over

operations near Indonesia’s Natuna Islands from December

China s influence in Pakistan.

China and India have not demarcated their borders in

areas such as Kashmir and Arunachal Pradesh. As China and

Bhutan, which has close relations with India, have claimed

territorial rights over the Doklam Plateau, Chinese and Indian

military forces staged a standoff at the plateau from June to

August 2017. On the other hand, it has been pointed out that

China has recently striven to improve its relationship with

India, while giving consideration to a balance between its

relations with Pakistan and India. Because China identifies

the relationship with India as a strategic partnership, the

leaders of the two countries actively conduct mutual visits.

In December 2018, China and India resumed their “Hand in

Hand” bilateral anti-terrorism drill that had been suspended

since the Doklam standoff. The background for progress in

China’s relations with India seems to include an emphasis

on economic growth of the two countries and a response to

closer U.S.-India relations.

In recent years, China has also been deepening its relations

with Sri Lanka. Initially after taking office, President

Maithripala Sirisena, who won the election in January 2015,

suspended the Colombo Port City development projects

financed by China. However, he subsequently announced

the resumption of the projects in January 2016, and new

development projects with China have also been showing

progress. In July 2017, an agreement was reached to lend

interests to Chinese enterprises at the Port of Hambantota,

which was being constructed with Chinese loans. Some have

noted that these moves constitute what has been described as

a “debt trap.” Additionally, China is deepening its relations

with Bangladesh through its port development in Chittagong

where a naval base is located, arms exports, and other deals.


（2）Relations with Central Asian Countries

The Xinjiang Uyghur Autonomous Region, located in

the western part of China, is situated next to Central Asia.

Therefore, China is deeply concerned about the political

stability and security situations, such as terrorism by Islamic

extremists, in Central Asian states. Such concerns of China

appear to be reflected in China’s tightened border control

and its engagement in the SCO and the stabilization of

Afghanistan. Moreover, China is strongly interested in

Central Asia, with a view to diversifying its supply sources

and procurement methods for resources. China promotes

cooperation in the energy field with Central Asian countries,

such as the construction of oil and natural gas pipelines


**Chapter**


between China and Central Asian nations.


（3）Relations with South Asian Countries

China has traditionally maintained a particularly close

relationship with Pakistan, and mutual visits by their

summit leaders take place frequently. Their cooperation in

the military sector, including bilateral exercises, exporting

weapons and transferring military technology, is also

considered to be deepening. As the importance of sea lanes

increases for China, it is believed that the importance of

Pakistan is rising for China accordingly, partly because of

the geopolitical features of Pakistan which faces the Indian

Ocean. China has also conducted various bilateral military

exercises with Pakistan, including naval search and rescue

training and anti-terrorism drills. The China-Pakistan

Economic Corridor (CPEC), a China-supported development

plan for power facilities and transportation infrastructure in

the region stretching from the Port of Gwadar to Kashgar

in the Xinjiang Uyghur Autonomous Region, is a flagship

project of the BRI. While some have pointed out that the

project has run into difficulties as indicated by delays and

partial withdrawals due to Pakistan’s deteriorating financial

situation, the project’s progress is expected to further increase


（4）Relations with European Countries

For China, the European Union (EU) countries have become

an important partner especially in the economic field.

European countries possess more advanced military

technologies than China or Russia regarding information

and communication technology, avionics/aeroengines, air

independence propulsion (AIP) systems for submarines, and

other areas. The EU countries have maintained their arms

embargo on China since the Tiananmen Square incident in

1989 and China has requested them to lift the embargo.[24] If

the EU arms embargo on China were lifted, sophisticated

Darwin Port has raised debates over security. China has also

been boosting its relations with Pacific island countries by

providing them with proactive and continuous economic

support and medical services deploying a military hospital

ship. China has promoted resources development in Papua

New Guinea and signed an agreement with the island

country on military cooperation. China has also been moving

to enhance military relations with Vanuatu, Fiji, and Tonga.

While China has been enhancing relations with Pacific island

nations, Australia and some other countries have expressed

concerns about such Chinese moves. In September 2019, the

Solomon Islands and Kiribati severed diplomatic relations

with Taiwan and established such relations with China.

China has been striving to further deepen its relations


Additionally, China and Ukraine have close ties in the


field of arms procurement, as indicated by China’s purchase

of the unfinished Ukrainian Kuznetsov-class aircraft

carrier “Varyag,” which was the basis of the aircraft carrier

“Liaoning.” Therefore, the relationship between these two

countries will attract attention going forward.

China’s recent rise has attracted attention from the NATO

as well. The London declaration adopted at a NATO summit

conference in December 2019 referred to China’s growing

influence as both “opportunities and challenges” and noted

necessity to address China as an Alliance. After the summit,

NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg mentioned China’s

deployment of numerous intermediate-range missiles and

noted that NATO was considering how China could be

included in future arms control.

China operates an outer space observation facility. In June

(5) Relations with Middle East and African Countries,
Pacific Island countries, and Central and South
American Countries

China has been enhancing its relations with Middle Eastern

and African nations in the economic realm. In recent years, it

has also strengthened military relations with them. Not only

intensive interactions among state leaders and senior military

officials but also arms exports and exchanges between

military forces are actively conducted. China also actively

dispatches personnel to undertake UN PKO in Africa. Some

suspect that underlying these movements could be China’s

aim to ensure a stable supply of natural resources and to

secure overseas bases in the future. In December 2016, São

Tomé and Príncipe severed diplomatic relations with Taiwan

and re-established relations with China, followed by Burkina

Faso in May 2018.

Australia, while continuing to give priority to economic

relations with China, is apparently concerned about China

regarding the security area including the information and

communications sector. A Chinese company’s agreement

China's arms exports have surpassed imports since 2013.

China has been expanding exports of weapons such as small

arms, tanks, aircraft including drones, and ships. China’s

major arms export destinations include Pakistan, Bangladesh

and Myanmar. China has also been reportedly exporting

arms to Algeria, Tanzania, Nigeria, Sudan, and other African

countries, Venezuela and other Latin American countries,

and Iran, Saudi Arabia, and other Middle Eastern countries.

Recently, Serbia has been reported likely to become the first

European country to introduce Chinese UAVs. Some claim

that China has transferred weapons to foreign countries in

order to strengthen its strategic relationships with friendly

nations, enhance its influence in the international community,

and secure natural resources. China has not participated

two systems” model and called for negotiations between

“government-authorized agencies.” After winning reelection

with the highest ever number of votes in a Taiwanese

presidential election in January 2020, President Tsai told a

press conference the election results represented the value

of Taiwanese people and rejected the “one country, two

systems” model. In a manner to check the Taiwanese side,

China noted that regardless of how the Taiwanese situation

changed, there would be no change to the basic fact that there

is only one China in the world, with Taiwan being a part of

China.

Since around the inauguration of President Tsai for her

first term, Taiwanese delegates were refused attendance

at or had their invitations deferred from meetings held by

international organizations, including ones in which they

had participated up to that point.[26] As the Solomon Islands

and Kiribati severed diplomatic relations with Taiwan and

established such relations with China in September 2019,

the number of countries having diplomatic relations with

Taiwan declined to 15 from 22 in May 2016, when President

Tsai took office. Taiwan is strongly protesting these actions,

claiming them to be “actions taken by China that compress

the international space of Taiwan.”

Both China and Taiwan have put forth their own assertions

regarding the Senkaku Islands, but Taiwan has a negative

attitude toward cooperating with China.[27]

**2** Military Capabilities of Taiwan


**1** Relations with China


China upholds the principle that Taiwan is a part of China

and that the Taiwan issue is a domestic one. China maintains

that the “One China” principle is the underlying premise

and foundation for dialogue between China and Taiwan.

Taiwanese President Tsai Ing-wen from the Democratic

Progressive Party, who took office in 2016, has noted that

she has never accepted the “1992 Consensus” that China

claims as embodying the “One-China” principle.[25] In

response, China has criticized the Democratic Progressive

Party for destroying the political foundation of the peaceful

development of cross-Strait relations by rejecting the “1992

Consensus” unilaterally, emphasizing that the maintenance

of the “1992 Consensus” would be the unshakable

foundation for peace and stability of cross-Strait relations.

China is strongly opposed to any foreign intervention in

the unification of China as well as any move towards the

independence of Taiwan and has repeatedly stated that it has

not renounced the use of force. “The Anti-Secession Law,”

enacted in March 2005, clearly lays out China’s policy of

not renouncing the use of force, providing that in the event

that the "Taiwan independence" secessionist forces (those

seeking Taiwan’s independence) should act under any name

or by any means to cause the fact of Taiwan's secession

from China or that possibilities for a peaceful reunification

should be completely exhausted, the state shall employ non
peaceful means and other necessary measures to protect

China's sovereignty and territorial integrity.

In a January 2019 speech at an event commemorating


**Chapter**


Under President Tsai Ing-wen, Taiwan has put forth

visions such as the military strategy of “resolute defense

and multidomain deterrence,” the overall defense concept

of “force protection, decisive battle in littoral zone, and

destruction of enemy at landing beach,” and the “strengthening

of information, communications, and electronic operational

capabilities.” The Taiwan National Defense Report 2019,

released in September 2019 as the second such report under


the 40th anniversary of China’s “Message to Compatriots

in Taiwan,” General Secretary Xi Jinping advocated a five
point proposal for managing relations with Taiwan, stating

“the specific form of the ‘one country, two systems’ model

in Taiwan will give full consideration to the situation in

Taiwan.” In her immediate response to the speech, President

Tsai issued a statement firmly rejecting the “one country,

Taiwan’s Kuomintang Nationalist Party (Taiwan’s ruling party at the time), viewed as parties to the consensus, have reportedly differed over the interpretation of the consensus. Taiwan’s
Democratic Progressive Party has clarified that it has not accepted the “1992 Consensus.”

and volunteers.[28]

With regard to Taiwan’s military power, at present, ground

forces, including the Navy Marine Corps, have a total of

approximately 93,000 personnel. In addition, it is assessed

that approximately 1.66 million reserve personnel of the

air, naval, and ground forces would be available in case of

war. Regarding naval capabilities, in addition to Kidd-class

destroyers which were imported from the United States,

Taiwan possesses the indigenously built “Tuo Chiang” stealth

corvette, among other vessels. Regarding air capabilities,

Taiwan possesses F-16 (A/B and C/D) fi ghters, Mirage 2000

fi ghters, Ching-kuo fi ghters, and other assets.


President Tsai, followed these visions and clarifi ed Taiwan

as an important security partner to the United States in the

Indo-Pacifi c region. The United States has made decisions

to sell arms to Taiwan under the Taiwan Relations Act. Since

President Trump took offi ce in 2017, six such decisions have

been made. In 2019, the president notifi ed Congress of its

plan to sell such weapons as 66 F-16C/D Block 70 fi ghters to

Taiwan, the fi rst U.S. fi ghter sales to Taiwan in the 27 years

since 1992.


Aside from the purchases from the United States, Taiwan

is moving forward with its own development of defense

equipment, and the Quadrennial Defense Review (2017

QDR) published in March 2017 emphasizes Taiwan’s

willingness to promote the development of the defense

industry, especially the indigenous production of weapons

and equipment. For example, in June 2016, the Taiwan Navy

announced a policy to switch over major ships, including

submarines, to an indigenous shipbuilding program. The

National Defense Report 2019 set forth a target of delivering

a prototype of an indigenous submarine by 2025.

**3** Military Balance between China and Taiwan

While China has continued to increase its defense budget

by a signifi cant margin, Taiwan’s defense budget, at 351.2

billion Taiwan dollars for FY2020, has remained almost

unchanged for nearly 20 years. China’s announced military

budget in FY2020 totals 1,268 billion yuan, roughly 16 times

the amount of Taiwan’s in terms of U.S. dollars based on

exchange rates announced by the Taiwanese Central Bank.

It is pointed out that China’s actual defense expenditure has

been larger than the published defense budget, indicating that

the China-Taiwan defense expenditure gap could be greater.

Amid this situation, President Tsai has ordered an increase in

Taiwan’s defense budget.[29]

acknowledges that China is capable of conducting joint

landing operations to take over Taiwan’s offshore islands,

**Column** Changing Military Balance between China and Taiwan

As for the military balance between the Taiwanese forces and
the People’s Liberation Army (PLA), which face off across the
Taiwan Strait, the Taiwanese forces were previously said to
possess military superiority in accordance with Taiwan’s
superiority in such areas as technological prowess. However,
the military balance is considered to have been changing in
recent years. China has continuously increased its national
defense spending at a high pace against the backdrop of its
rapid economic growth in recent years, and based on that, it
has rapidly and extensively strengthened its military power in
terms of quality and quantity. As a result, since the 2000s, the The Taiwan military’s F-16 fighter

recent years, however, China has been steadily improving

its landing and invasion capabilities by building large

Comparison of military capabilities should be made based

not only on the troop strength and the performance and

quantity of equipment but also on various other factors such

as the purpose and aspects of assumed military operations,

operational arrangements, the skill level of personnel, and

logistics. Nevertheless, the overall military balance between

China and Taiwan is tilting to China’s favor, and the gap

appears to be growing year by year. Going forward, attention

needs to be paid to trends such as the strengthening of

Chinese and Taiwanese forces, the sale of weapons to Taiwan

by the United States, and Taiwan’s own development of its

main military equipment.

On the Korean Peninsula, people of the same ethnicity have

been divided into two—north and south—for more than half

a century. Even today, the ROK and North Korea pit their

ground forces of about 1.6 million against each other across

the demilitarized zone (DMZ).


Peace and stability on the Korean Peninsula under such

security environment is an extremely important challenge

not only to Japan but also to the entire region of East Asia.

**❶[ North Korea ]**


the Central Committee of the KWP, Chairman Kim stated

that, since the United States was holding U.S.-ROK joint

military exercises, there were no grounds for North Korea

to be unilaterally bound any longer by a commitment that

no other party honors. He also announced the intention to

continue developing strategic weapons until the United

States rolls back its hostile policy towards North Korea.

In addition, Chairman Kim stated that North Korea should

take an offensive for making a breakthrough head-on aimed

at neutralizing the sanctions and pressure by the hostile

forces and opening a new avenue for socialist construction,

declaring the economy to be the key. Moreover, he stated

at the same meeting that powerful political, diplomatic and

military guarantees would be needed, indicating that North

Korea will continue to make efforts to maintain and enhance

its military capabilities and combat readiness. According to

the official announcement at the Supreme People’s Assembly

in April 2020, the proportion of the defense budget in the

FY2019 budget of North Korea was 15.9%. However, it

is believed that this represents only a fraction of the real

defense expenditures.

North Korea has continued to promote the development

of weapons of mass destruction (WMDs) and ballistic

missiles and the enhancement of its operation capabilities,

including by conducting six nuclear tests so far and

repeatedly launching ballistic missiles in recent years at

an unprecedented frequency. In addition, North Korea

is assessed to possess large-scale cyber units as part of

its asymmetric military capabilities, engaging in theft of

military secrets and developing capabilities to attack critical

infrastructure of foreign countries. It also retains large
scale special operation forces. In addition, North Korea has

repeatedly used provocative rhetoric and behavior against

relevant countries, including Japan.

Such military trends in North Korea pose grave and

imminent threats to Japan’s security and significantly

undermine the peace and security of the region and the

international community.

Needless to say, North Korea’s possession of nuclear

weapons cannot be tolerated. At the same time, sufficient

attention needs to be paid to the development and deployment

of ballistic missiles, the military confrontation on the Korean


**1** General Situation

North Korea has been advocating the building of a strong

socialist state in all areas—ideology, politics, military affairs,

and economy, and it adopts “military-first (Songun) politics”

to realize this goal. “Military-first (Songun) politics” has

been defined as a basic form of socialist politics that leads the

great undertaking of socialism to victory by giving priority

to the military forces in all activities under the principle of

military first, and strengthening and relying on the actors

in the revolution with the Korean People’s Army (KPA)

acting as the central and main force.[1] At the Plenary Meeting

of the Central Committee of the Korean Workers’ Party

(KWP) in March 2013, Chairman Kim Jong-un[2] adopted

the “Byungjin line” policy of simultaneous economic and

nuclear development. At the Seventh KWP Congress in May

2016, he made it clear that he would uphold the “Byungjin

line” as well as the “Songun politics.” Between 2016 and

2017, North Korea pushed ahead with three nuclear tests and

as many as 40 ballistic missile launches. The international

community responded by imposing sanctions under relevant

UN Security Council resolutions, while Japan and the

United States were among those who strengthened their own

sanctions against North Korea.

On the other hand, at the Plenary Meeting of the Central

Committee of the KWP in April 2018, Chairman Kim

declared that the “Byungjin line” had been successfully

carried out as the development of the state nuclear force had

been completed. He also announced that the KWP’s “new

strategic line” was that the whole of the party and the whole

of the state will fully concentrate efforts on the construction

of a socialist economy, indicating his policy of concentrating

on economic development. In addition, North Korea decided

to discontinue “nuclear test and inter-continental ballistic

rocket test-fire” and to dismantle the northern nuclear test

ground, announcing in May 2018 that the nuclear test ground

had been blown up. During the U.S.-North Korea summit

meeting that June, Chairman Kim expressed the intention

to work toward denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula.

However, the February 2019 U.S.-North Korea summit

meeting ended without any agreement being reached between

the two parties. At the December 2019 Plenary Meeting of

Peninsula, and the proliferation of WMDs and ballistic

missiles by North Korea.

Partly because North Korea maintains its extremely

closed regime, it is difficult to accurately capture the details

and intentions of its behavior. However, it is necessary for

Japan to pay utmost attention to them. As for North Korea’s

abduction of Japanese nationals, utmost efforts continue

to be made to realize the return of all abductees to Japan

as quickly as possible by close cooperation with related

countries, including the United States.

**2 Military Posture**

（1）General Situation

North Korea has been building up its military capabilities

in accordance with the Four Military Guidelines (extensive

training for all soldiers, modernizing all military forces,

arming the entire population, and fortifying the entire

country).[3]

North Korea’s military forces are comprised mainly of

ground forces, with a total troop strength of roughly 1.28

million. While North Korea still maintains substantial

military forces, its conventional forces are markedly inferior

to those of the ROK’s military and U.S. Forces Korea, and

most of its equipment is outdated. Contributory factors to

this situation include the reduction in military assistance

from the former Soviet bloc due to the collapse of the Cold

War structure, limitations on defense spending caused by

the weak economy, and the rapid modernization of ROK’s

defense capability.

North Korea is thought to be attempting to compensate

for its consequent disadvantage by focusing its efforts on

building up its arsenal of WMDs and ballistic missiles. North

Korea also has forces such as a large-scale special operations

force that can conduct various operations ranging from

intelligence gathering and sabotage, to guerrilla warfare.

Moreover, North Korea seems to have many underground

military related installations across its territory.


personnel, and roughly two-thirds of them are believed to

be deployed along the DMZ. The main body of the army

is infantry, but the army also maintains armored forces

including at least 3,500 tanks and artillery. North Korea is

believed to regularly deploy long-range artillery along the

DMZ, such as 240 mm multiple rocket launchers and 170

mm self-propelled guns, which can reach cities and bases

in the northern part of the ROK including the capital city of

Seoul.

The Navy has about 800 ships with a total displacement

of approximately 111,000 tons and is chiefly comprised of

small naval vessels such as high-speed missile craft. Also, it

has about 20 of the former model Romeo-class submarines,

about 50 midget submarines, and about 140 air cushioned

landing crafts, the latter two of which are believed to be used

for infiltration and transportation of the special operations

forces.

The Air Force has approximately 550 combat aircraft,

most of which are out-of-date models made in China or

the former Soviet Union. However, some fourth-generation

aircraft such as MiG-29 fighters and Su-25 attack aircraft are

also included. North Korea has a large number of outdated

An-2 transport aircraft as well, which are believed to be used

for transportation of special operations forces.

In addition, North Korea has so-called asymmetric

military capabilities, namely, special operations force whose

size is estimated at 100,000 personnel.[4] In recent years, North

Korea is seen to be placing importance on and strengthening

its cyber forces.[5]

See Chapter 3, Section 3-2-3 (North Korea)

**3** WMD and Ballistic Missiles


**Chapter**


In recent years, North Korea has launched ballistic missiles

at an unprecedented frequency, rapidly improving its

operational capabilities, such as simultaneous launch and

surprise attack. In addition, given the technological maturity

obtained through a series of nuclear tests, North Korea is

assessed to have already miniaturized nuclear weapons to fit

ballistic missile warheads.

These military trends in North Korea pose grave and

imminent threats to Japan’s security and significantly


（2）Military Capabilities

The North Korean Army comprises about 1.10 million


The Four Military Guidelines were adopted at the fifth plenary meeting of the fourth KWP Central Committee in 1962.

James Thurman, then Commander of the U.S. Forces Korea, stated, “North Korea possesses the world’s largest special operations force of over 60,000” in his speech at the Association of U.S.
Army in October 2012. Additionally, the ROK Defense White Paper 2018 notes, “Special operation forces are currently estimated at approximately 200,000 strong.” The white paper pointed
out that North Korea’s special operations force has become an independent military branch.

undermine the peace and security of the region and the

international community. Additionally, such development

poses a serious challenge to the entire international

community with regard to the non-proliferation of weapons,

including WMDs.

On the other hand, at the Plenary Meeting of the Central

Committee of the KWP held on April 20, 2018, decisions

were made to discontinue “nuclear test and inter-continental

ballistic rocket test-fire,” and to dismantle the northern

nuclear test ground. In the subsequent inter-Korean summit

meeting held on April 27 and in the U.S.-North Korea

summit meeting held on June 12, North Korea expressed its

intention to work towards denuclearization. Then, on May

24, international press representatives were invited to witness

the destruction of the northern nuclear test ground.

However, North Korea has not yet carried out the

dismantlement of all WMDs and ballistic missiles of all

ranges in a complete, verifiable, and irreversible manner.

Having repeatedly carried out ballistic missile launches in

breach of relevant Security Council resolutions since May

2019, it seems that North Korea has been striving to develop

more advanced technologies and operational capabilities in

this field. Japan cannot possibly turn a blind eye to this series

of missile launches, which is an issue of serious concern to

the international community as well. At the December 2019

Plenary Meeting of the Central Committee of the KWP,

Chairman Kim stated that, since the United States was

holding U.S.-ROK joint military exercises, there were no

grounds for North Korea to be unilaterally bound any longer

by a commitment that no other party fails to honor. He also

announced the intention to continue developing strategic

weapons until the United States rolls back its hostile policy

towards North Korea. Furthermore, at the enlarged meeting

of the Central Military Commission of the KWP in May

2020 guided by Kim Jong-un, North Korea announced that

new policies for further increasing nuclear war deterrence

and putting the strategic armed forces on a high alert were

set forth and crucial measures for considerably increasing the

firepower strike ability of the KPA’s artillery were taken.


Looking to the future, it will be necessary to continue to

carefully monitor moves by North Korea, including what kind

of concrete actions it will take towards the dismantlement of

all weapons of mass destruction and ballistic missiles of all

ranges in a complete, verifiable and irreversible manner.


（1）Nuclear Weapons

a. The Current Status of the Nuclear Weapons Program

Details of the current status of North Korea’s nuclear weapons

program are largely unclear, partly because North Korea remains

an extremely closed regime. In light of the unclear status of

past nuclear developments, and considering North Korea has

already conducted six nuclear tests including the nuclear test in

September 2017, it is conceivable that North Korea has made

considerable progress in its nuclear weapons program.

With regard to plutonium, a fissile material that can be

used for nuclear weapons,[6] North Korea has suggested its

production and extraction on several instances.[7] As for recent

activities, in September 2015, North Korea announced that all

nuclear facilities in Yongbyon, including the nuclear reactor

and the reprocessing facility, the disablement of which was

agreed upon at the fifth and the sixth round of the Six-Party

Talks in February and September 2007, respectively, had

been readjusted and had started normal operation.[8] Because

the restarting of the reactor could lead to the production and

extraction of plutonium by North Korea, those activities are

causes of great concern.

As for highly enriched uranium that can also be used

for nuclear weapons, in June 2009, North Korea declared

the commencement of uranium enrichment. In November

2010, North Korea disclosed its uranium enrichment facility

to American nuclear specialists and later announced that it

was operating a uranium enrichment plant equipped with

thousands of centrifuges. The expansion of this uranium

enrichment plant has been suggested in August 2013; in this

regard, North Korea could have increased its enrichment

capabilities. The series of North Korean behaviors related

to uranium enrichment indicate the possibility of the

development of nuclear weapons using highly enriched


**Chapter**


Plutonium is synthetically produced in a nuclear reactor by irradiating uranium with neutrons, and then extracting it from used nuclear fuel at a reprocessing facility. Plutonium is then used
as a basic material for the production of nuclear weapons. Meanwhile, in order to use uranium for nuclear weapons, it is necessary to extract uranium 235 (U235), a highly fissile material,
from natural uranium. This process is called enrichment. Generally, a large-scale enrichment facility that combines thousands of centrifuges is used to boost the U235 concentration to
nuclear weapon levels (over 90%).

North Korea announced in October 2003 that it had completed the reprocessing of 8,000 used fuel rods that contain plutonium, and in May 2005 that it had completed extraction of an
additional 8,000 used fuel rods. The ROK’s Defense White Paper 2018 estimates that North Korea possesses around 50 kg of plutonium, retaining the assessment given in the Defense
White Paper 2016.

The “Worldwide Threat Assessment” of the U.S. Director of National Intelligence of January 2016 notes, “North Korea has followed through on its announcement by expanding the size of
its enrichment facility and restarting the reactor that was previously used for plutonium production.” It is said that the reactor was restarted at the end of August 2013. It has been noted
th t if th t i t t d N th K ld h th bilit t d h l t i ( i t l 6 k ) t f t i t l l b b i

uranium in addition to plutonium.[9]

Regarding these nuclear-related activities, activities that

are inconsistent with a “commitment to work toward complete

denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula,” which North

Korea insists it upholds, have been pointed out. For example,

U.S. Secretary of State Pompeo testified in the Senate in July

2018 that North Korea was continuing to produce nuclear

fuels. In addition, at a meeting of the International Atomic

Energy Agency (IAEA) Board of Governors, then IAEA

Director General Amano pointed out in March 2019 that the

IAEA continued to observe signs of North Korea using the

enrichment facility at nuclear facilities in Yongbyon.

With regard to the development of nuclear weapons, North

Korea has conducted nuclear tests on October 9, 2006, May

25, 2009, February 12, 2013, January 6, 2016, September 9,

2016, and September 3, 2017. It is highly likely that North

Korea has made strides in its nuclear weapons program,

collecting the necessary data through these nuclear tests.

It is believed that North Korea seeks to miniaturize nuclear

weapons and develop them into warheads that can be mounted

on ballistic missiles, as part of its nuclear weapons program.

On September 3, 2017, it was announced that Chairman Kim

Jong-un had visited North Korea’s Nuclear Weapons Institute

and had seen a hydrogen bomb capable of being loaded into

an ICBM,[10] in addition to which, following North Korea’s

sixth nuclear test that was forced through on the same day,

North Korea announced that it “successfully carried out a test

of H-bomb for ICBM.” In general, miniaturizing a nuclear

weapon small enough to be mounted on a ballistic missile

requires a considerably high degree of technological capacity.

However, considering, for example, that the United States, the

former Soviet Union, the United Kingdom, France, and China

succeeded in acquiring such technology by as early as the

1960s, as well as the technological maturity that is estimated to

have been reached through North Korea’s previous six nuclear


tests, it is assessed that North Korea has already miniaturized

nuclear weapons to fit ballistic missile warheads.[11]

Furthermore, the yield of the sixth nuclear weapons test in

2017 was estimated to be the largest ever, with a maximum

yield of approximately 160 kt. Given the size of the estimated

yield, the possibility cannot be discounted that the test was of

a hydrogen bomb.[12]

In any case, North Korea’s nuclear weapons development,

considered in conjunction with North Korean efforts to

enhance ballistic missile capabilities, including extending

the range of ballistic missiles that are the delivery vehicles

of WMDs, poses grave and imminent threats to Japan’s

security, and significantly undermines peace and security

of the region and international community. Therefore, it can

never be tolerated.

b. Background of the Nuclear Program

As regards the objective of North Korea’s nuclear

development, North Korea is deemed to be developing nuclear

weapons as an indispensable deterrent for maintaining the

existing regime in light of the following: North Korea’s

ultimate goal is allegedly the maintenance of the existing

regime;[13] North Korea considers that it needs its own nuclear

deterrence to counter the nuclear threat of the United States

and is in no position at least in the short-term to overturn its

inferiority in conventional forces vis-à-vis the United States

and the ROK; North Korea asserts that the Iraqi and Libyan

regimes collapsed and that Syria was attacked by U.S. Forces

in April 2017 due to their lack of nuclear deterrence;[14] and

North Korea has reiterated that nuclear weapons will never

be traded away at negotiations.

With regard to the issue of North Korea’s development

of nuclear weapons, Chairman Kim expressed the desire on

a number of occasions—including at the U.S.-North Korea

summit meeting held on June 12, 2018—to work towards

the complete denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula.


**Chapter**


9 The ROK Defense White Paper 2018 assesses that North Korea possesses a substantial amount of highly enriched uranium (HEU). It has been noted that a uranium enrichment facility
different from the one in Yongbyon exists in Kangson.

10 On September 3, 2017, in a report on a visit by Chairman Kim Jong-un to North Korea’s Nuclear Weapons Institute, the Korean Central News Agency (KCNA) announced that North Korea is
able to conduct an “ultra-powerful electromagnetic pulse (EMP) attack over a wide area.”

11 Over ten years have already passed since North Korea conducted its first nuclear test in October 2006. Furthermore, North Korea has conducted six nuclear tests to date. This timetable for
technology development and the number of tests are reaching levels that are by no means inadequate, even when compared to the processes of developing technologies to miniaturize
and lighten nuclear weapons in the United States, former Soviet Union, the United Kingdom, France, and China. The ROK’s Defense White Paper 2018 assesses that “North Korea’s ability to
miniaturize nuclear weapons seems to have reached a considerable level.”

12 The ROK’s Defense White Paper 2018 noted that the explosive yield of the sixth nuclear test was approximately 50 kt, significantly larger than the yield of the past tests and that this was
assessed to be a hydrogen bomb test. North Korea also insisted that its fourth nuclear test, conducted in January 2016, was a hydrogen bomb test. However, given that the yield of that test
is estimated at 6 to 7 kt, it is difficult to conceive that this was a hydrogen bomb test as generally defined.

13 According to “Military and Security Developments Involving the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea,” U.S. DoD (February 2016)
14 For example, a comment in the Rodong Sinmun dated December 2, 2013, contends that the situation in Iraq and Libya teaches an acute lesson that countries under the constant threat of U.S.
preemptive nuclear attack have no choice but to become a victim of U.S. state terrorism, unless the countries have powerful deterrent capability. In addition, the “Statement by the
Spokesperson of the Foreign Ministry of the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea” dated April 8, 2017, states with regard to the U.S. attack on Syria two days earlier on April 6 as follows:
“S i th US h b i ki l t i ith t l d th T d i i t ti i ti ”

However, he is presumed to have done so on the premise that

North Korea would continue to possess a nuclear arsenal. In

fact, North Korea has frequently asserted to the international

community its claim to the status of “a nuclear weapon

state” and has repeatedly insisted that it will not agree to

unilateral denuclearization. For example, at the December

2019 Plenary Meeting of the Central Committee of the

KWP, Chairman Kim stated that if the United States persists

in its hostile policy, there will never be denuclearization on

the Korean Peninsula, and that North Korea will maintain

a powerful nuclear deterrent capable of guaranteeing its

long-term security. In addition, it has been noted that even

after announcing a commitment to full denuclearization of

the Korean Peninsula, North Korea has continued nuclear

development[15] and that a uranium enrichment facility not

disclosed by North Korea exists.


In light of the above, it is now necessary to keep a close

watch on what kind of concrete actions it will take towards

the dismantlement of all WMDs and all ballistic missiles of

all ranges in a complete, verifiable and irreversible manner.

（2）Biological and Chemical Weapons

North Korea is an extremely closed regime. In addition, most

materials, equipment, and technology used for manufacturing

biological and chemical weapons are for both military and

civilian uses, which in turn facilitates camouflage. For these

reasons, details of the status of North Korea’s biological and

chemical weapons development and arsenals are unclear.

However, with regard to chemical weapons, North Korea

is suspected to have several facilities capable of producing

chemical agents and already a substantial stockpile of such

agents. North Korea is also thought to have some infrastructure

for the production of biological weapons.[16] Possession of

sarin, VX, mustard and other chemical weapons, and of

anthrax, smallpox, pest and other biological agents that could

be used as biological weapons have been pointed out.

The possibility cannot be denied that North Korea is able

to load biological and/or chemical weapons on warheads.

（3）Ballistic Missiles

As is the case with WMDs, many of the details of North

Korea’s ballistic missiles are unknown, partly owing to the

country’s extremely closed regime. It appears, however, that

North Korea gives high priority to the development of ballistic

missiles out of political and diplomatic considerations and

from the viewpoint of earning foreign currency, in addition


to enhancing its military capabilities. The ballistic missiles

currently deemed to be possessed and developed by North

Korea are the following.[17]

See Fig. I-2-3-2 (Ballistic Missiles Developed or Possessed by North Korea)

Fig. I-2-3-4 (Major Trends in North Korea’s Ballistic Missile Launches)

Fig. I-2-3-6 (Cases of North Korean Ballistic Missiles Launched on a
Lofted Trajectory)

a. Types of Ballistic Missiles Possessed or Developed by
North Korea
(a) Toksa
Toksa is a short-range ballistic missile with a range estimated

to be approximately 120 km. It is transported and operated

on a TEL.[18] It is deemed that Toksa is the first ballistic missile


16 For example, the ROK Defense White Paper 2018 points out that, following the commencement of production in the 1980s, it is estimated that North Korea has a stock of 2,500-5,000 tons
of various chemical weapons stored. It also notes that North Korea likely has the capability to produce a variety of biological weapons including anthrax, smallpox, and pests. Moreover, the
U.S. DoD’s “Military and Security Developments Involving the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea” of May 2018 points out that, “North Korea probably could employ CW [chemical
weapons] agents by modifying a variety of conventional munitions, including artillery and ballistic missiles.” North Korea ratified the Biological Weapons Convention in 1987 but has not
acceded to the Chemical Weapons Convention.

17 According to “Jane’s Sentinel Security Assessment China and Northeast Asia” (accessed in March 2020) North Korea possesses 700 to 1,000 ballistic missiles in total, 45% of which are
presumed to be Scud-class, 45% Nodong-class, and the remaining 10% other intermediate- and long-range ballistic missiles.

18 The signs of a launch from a fixed launcher are easy for the adversary to detect and are vulnerable to attack by the adversary. TEL was developed mainly by the former Soviet Union among
others in order to make the detection of launch signs more difficult and increase survivability. According to the U.S. DoD’s “Military and Security Developments Involving the Democratic
People’s Republic of Korea” of May 2018, North Korea possesses a maximum of 100 TELs for Scuds, 50 TELs for Nodongs, and 50 TELs for IRBMs (Musudans).

As for a TEL-mounted missile launch, it is deemed difficult to detect individual specific signs in advance concerning the detailed location and timing of the launch. This is because it is
operated by being mounted and transported on a TEL, and furthermore, military-related underground facilities are thought to exist all over North Korea.

Along with activities related to the development of ballistic missiles, developments related to the building of TELs require close watch as they concern the operational capabilities of ballistic

tactical guided weapon ) launched in 2019 on May 4
and 9, July 25, and August 6 are all presumed to have the
same system and to be of a new and different type from
missiles such as Nodong and Scud. Two missiles were
launched on each of the aforementioned dates and flew
approximately 200-600 km. The launched missiles have
a shape similar to that of the Russian short-range ballistic
missile “Iskander,” which is said to be able to fly at a
lower altitude than conventional ballistic missiles and on
an irregular trajectory.

(ii) SRBM B

The SRBM (described by North Korea as “new weapon”

or as “tactical guided weapon”) launched on August 10

and 16, 2019 and on March 21, 2020 are all presumed to

have the same system and to be of a new and different type

again from the aforementioned A-type. Two missiles were

launched on each of the aforementioned dates and flew

approximately 250-400 km.

(iii) SRBM C
The SRBM (described by North Korea as “super-large
multiple rocket launcher”) launched in 2019 on August
24, September 10, October 31, and November 28, and
on March 2 and 9, 2020 are all presumed to be of a new
and different type again from the aforementioned A-and
B-types. Two missiles were launched on each of the
aforementioned dates and flew approximately 300-400
km. The interval between launches was estimated at about
3 minutes in the case of the October 31, 2019 launches,
and less than 1 minute during the launches on November
28, 2019 and March 2, 2020, suggesting that North Korea
is trying to improve the continuous fire capability required
for saturation attacks and the like.

In addition, North Korea carried out two launches of what

could have been SRBMs on July 31, 2019 and another two a

couple of days later, on August 2. Another two SRBMs were

launched on March 29, 2020; analysis of the specific type of

shell is still under way.

Through such launches, North Korea appears to

be pursuing enhancement of related technologies and

operational capabilities, including enhancing secrecy and

instantaneity, to make it difficult to detect signs of a launch,

as well as improving its ability to conduct surprise attacks

and its continuous fire capability. Considering the distances

flown, it would appear that not only the ROK, but also parts

of Japan would be within range of some of the SRBMs

launched. There is also a concern that this short-range

ballistic missile technology will be applied to longer-range

missiles in due course.

possessed or developed by North Korea which adopts a solid

fuel propellant.

(b) New SRBM launched since 2019

Since 2019, North Korea has launched at least three types

of short-range ballistic missile that are presumed to be new

models. From images published by North Korea, it can be

ascertained that these three types of SRBM were launched

from a wheeled-drive or continuous-tracked TEL, with the

characteristic radial exhausts of solid fuel propellant engines

identifiable on each of the images.

(i) SRBM A
The SRBM (described by North Korea as “new type of


-----

a MaRV.[19] Given that North Korea announced that Chairman

Kim Jong-un had ordered the development of ballistic

missiles capable of precision attacks on enemy ships and

other individual targets, the intent appears to be to enhance

the accuracy of ballistic missile attacks.

(d) Nodong

The Nodong is a liquid fuel propelled single-stage ballistic

missile and is transported and operated on a TEL. It is

assessed to have a range of about 1,300 km, reaching almost

all of Japan.

Although the details of Nodong’s performance have

not been confirmed, Nodong may not have the accuracy to

carry out precise strikes on specific target installations, as

this ballistic missile is likely based on Scud technology.

However, it has been suggested that North Korea is working

to increase the Nodong’s accuracy. In this regard, it had been

suggested that there is a type of Nodong aimed at enhancing

accuracy by improving the shape of the warhead (whose

range is deemed to reach approximately 1,500 km through

the weight reduction of the warhead). Against this backdrop,

the launch of this type of ballistic missile was confirmed for

the first time in the images published by North Korea a day

after the launch of one Scud and two Nodong missiles on

July 19, 2016.

(e) SLBM

(i) SLBM “Pukguksong”

It has been suggested that North Korea is developing

an SLBM and a new submarine which is designed to carry

the SLBM (referred to by North Korea as “Pukguksong”).

Since it announced in May 2015 through its media that

it conducted a successful test launch of an SLBM, it has

made public SLBM “Pukguksong” launches on four

occasions.[20] Judging from the images and footage that it

has made public so far, North Korea may have succeeded

in operating the “cold launch system,” in which the missile

is ignited after it is ejected into the air. Moreover, in the

launches in April and August 2016, it appears, based on

observations such as the shape of the flame coming out of

the missile and the color of the smoke, that the solid fuel

propellant system was adopted.


Image publicly released by North Korea when it launched 4 Scud ERs (March 2017) [JANES]

**Chapter**
**2** (c) Scud

The Scud is a liquid fuel propellant single-stage ballistic

missile and is transported and operated on a TEL.

Scud B and Scud C, a variant of Scud B with extended

range, are SRBMs with ranges estimated to be about 300 km

and 500 km, respectively. It is believed that North Korea has

manufactured and deployed them, and has exported them to

the Middle East and other countries.

The Scud ER (Extended Range) is a ballistic missile that

has an extended range due to the extension of the Scud’s body

as well as the reduction in weight of the warhead, among

other factors. The range of a Scud ER is estimated to reach

approximately 1,000 km, and it appears that a part of Japan

falls within this range.

In addition, North Korea is developing a ballistic missile

that appears to be an improvement of the Scud missile. This

ballistic missile was launched on May 29, 2017. A day after

the launch, North Korea announced that it had successfully

conducted a test launch of a newly developed ballistic rocket

incorporating a precision navigation guidance system. In

addition, while the images released by North Korea show

that the ballistic missile was launched from a continuous

track TEL and had what appears to be small wings on its

warhead, i.e., characteristics different from those of existing

Scud missiles, the shape other than the warhead and length

are similar to existing Scud missiles. Another similarity is

that it can be confirmed that the missile has straight-line

exhausts characteristic of a liquid fuel-propelled engine. It

has also been noted that this ballistic missile is equipped with


19 For example, according to “Jane’s Sentinel Security Assessment China and Northeast Asia” (accessed in March 2020), the launch on May 29, 2017, was presumed to have been the first
launch of a short-range ballistic missile based on a Scud missile, equipped with a MaRV, suggesting that North Korea has made advances in its precision guidance systems.

20 On May 9, 2015, North Korea announced that it had succeeded in a test launch of an SLBM. On January 8, 2016, it released footage of an SLBM test launch that appears to be different
from the one unveiled in May 2015. On April 24 and August 25, 2016, it again announced that it had succeeded in SLBM test launches. Moreover, the MOD predicts that North Korea also

test equipment.
It is deemed that through developing the SLBM
and a new submarine to carry it, North Korea intends

to diversify its ballistic missile attack capabilities and

improve survivability.
(f) Ballistic Missile Modified from the SLBM

North Korea launched a ballistic missile on both February 12

and May 21, 2017, both of which appeared to be a modified

version of the SLBM “Pukguksong” for ground launch

(referred to by North Korea as “Pukguksong-2”). This ballistic

missile is estimated to have flown approximately 500 km on

also pointed out that North Korea seeks to develop a larger Korea will newly deploy a solid fuel propellant engine that

submarine to launch SLBMs.[21] includes Japan within its firing range.

(ii) SLBM “Pukguksong-3”

(g) Intermediate-Range Ballistic Missile (IRBM)-class

On October 2, 2019, North Korea launched what was
presumed to be a new type of SLBM (described by To date North Korea has launched three liquid fuel-propelled
North Korea as a “Pukguksong-3”) that differed from the IRBM-class ballistic missiles (referred to by North Korea as
SLBM “Pukguksong.” The missile in question flew for “Hwasong-12”). This ballistic missile was launched on May
about 450 km and is presumed to have fallen into Japan’s 14, 2017 and based on this flight pattern, it is presumed that

launched and flew over Japan s territory in the vicinity of the

Oshima Peninsula and Cape Erimo. These launches were the

first cases of North Korea launching what it calls ballistic

missiles that flew over Japan’s territory.

In view of their flight paths, these missiles appear to

demonstrate a certain level of function as an IRBM. Also,

the fact that missiles that overflew Japan were launched in

succession in a short time period would suggest that North

Korea is steadily improving its ballistic missile capabilities.

Furthermore, although at the time of launches in May and

August 2017 the missiles were confirmed to have been

launched after being separated from the wheel-drive TEL, at

the time of the September launch the missile was confirmed

to have been launched while still attached to the wheel-drive

TEL. Considering this point, together with North Korea’s

claims at the time of the launch that it was for the purposes of

“confirming practical operational procedures” and “realize

the potential of the ‘Hwasong-12,’” there is a possibility

that North Korea is improving its practical operational

capabilities.

In 2016 North Korea conducted repeated launches of

Musudan,[22] but although the missile launched in June flew

for a certain distance on a lofted trajectory, the fact that there

were two successive launch failures in October would suggest

that there may still be obstacles remaining towards the

operationalization of the Musudan and that North Korea may

be concentrating on the development and operationalization

of the “Hwasong-12” as an IRBM instead.

(h) Intercontinental-Range Ballistic Missile (ICBM)-class

(i) ICBM-class “Hwasong-14”
North Korea has launched ICBM-class ballistic missile
(referred to by North Korea as “Hwasong-14”) on July 4
and 28, 2017. From the flight pattern, it is presumed that the
two ballistic missiles were launched on a lofted trajectory.
If they were to have been launched on a normal trajectory,
it is estimated that they would have a maximum range of
at least 5,500 km. On July 4, the day of the launch, North
Korea made an “important announcement,” announcing
that it had successfully conducted a test launch of a new
type of ICBM. Furthermore, on the day following the July
28 launch, North Korea announced that the “nuclear bomb
detonation device” had functioned normally, emphasizing
that the safety of the warhead in an atmospheric reentry


environment had been made maintained. This suggests
that North Korea is aiming to operationalize long-range
ballistic missiles.

Based on images released by North Korea, the ballistic

missiles launched on July 4 and 28 have the following in

common with the IRBM-class ballistic missile launched

on May 14: (1) the engine system consists of one main

engine and four auxiliary engines; (2) the shape of the

lower part of the propulsion system is conical; and (3) the

straight-line flame of liquid-propulsion systems can be

confirmed. Based on these facts and the respective ranges

that can be estimated for the missiles, the possibility can

be deduced that the ICBM-class ballistic missile that were

launched on July 4 and 28 were developed on the basis of

the new-type IRBM-class ballistic missile that had been

launched on May 14.

Also based on images published by North Korea, it can

be confirmed that the ballistic missiles that were launched

on July 4 and 28 had been mounted on the wheeled eight
axle TEL similar to KN-08/14 (see (j) below). However,

it can be confirmed from the images at the time of the

launches that they were launched from simplified launch

pads, not TELs. Furthermore, the images suggest that the

missile was of two-stage construction.

(ii) ICBM-class “Hwasong-15”
On November 29, 2017, North Korea launched a single
missile that is presumed to have been an intercontinentalrange ballistic missile-class ballistic missile (referred to
by North Korea as “Hwasong-15”) different from the
aforementioned “Hwasong-14” missiles. From the flight
pattern it is presumed that the missile was launched on a
lofted trajectory. On the day of the launch, North Korea
made a “government statement,” declaring that it had
successfully conducted a test launch of the “Hwasong-15,”
a newly developed type of ICBM with the capability to
strike all areas of the U.S. mainland, and asserting that it
had now completed development of its state nuclear force.

The following points would suggest that this missile is

an intercontinental-range ballistic missile-class ballistic

missile, different from the ICBM-class ballistic missile

launched twice in July 2017: (1) its flight distance

and altitude; (2) the fact that North Korea announced

the successful test launch of a new type of ICBM, the

“Hwasong-15;” (3) the fact that the missile was deployed

on a previously unseen nine-axle wheel-drive TEL;

long-range ballistic missiles’ technological reliability had

been advanced by this launch because it is estimated that

(1) it successfully launched two similar types of ballistic

missiles in a row; (2) the missile flew in almost the same way

as the last launch; and (3) it put an object into orbit around

the Earth.

Accordingly, it is believed that these test launches of long
range ballistic missiles can contribute to the development

of shorter-range missiles in such ways as increasing the

of ballistic missiles. An intercontinental-range ballistic

missile-class ballistic missile launched in November 2017,

which could have a range in excess of 10,000 km, depending

on the weight of the warhead deployed, etc. Although it is

considered necessary for the operationalization of long-range

ballistic missiles to further verify technology for protecting

the re-entry vehicle from the ultrahigh temperature that is

generated during the atmospheric re-entry of the warhead

part, North Korea, with announcements such as the one in

November 2017 on the day of the launch of what is believed

to have been an intercontinental-range ballistic missile-class

ballistic missile, claiming that it had re-verified warhead

reliability in a reentry environment, is displaying an intention

to seek to secure and enhance technology aimed at the

operationalization of long-range ballistic missiles. Should

North Korea make further progress in the development

of ballistic missiles, including the acquiring of reentry

technologies, it may come to have a one-sided understanding

that it has secured a strategic deterrence against the United

States. However, if North Korea has such a false sense of

confidence and recognition regarding its deterrence, it could

lead to an increase and escalation of military provocations by

North Korea in the region and could create situations that are

deeply worrying also for Japan. North Korea is presumed to

have acquired the atmospheric re-entry technologies required

for the operationalization of Nodong and Scud-ER ballistic

missiles, within whose range Japan lies, suggesting that it

already has the ability to attack Japan with nuclear weapons

fitted to these ballistic missiles.

Secondly, North Korea may be aiming to enhance

the accuracy, continuous fire capability, and operational

capabilities necessary for saturation attacks and the like.

As for the Scud and Nodong, which are already deployed,

since 2014, they have been launched from unprecedented

locations, cutting across the Korean Peninsula, in the early

morning and late hours of the night using TELs, often in

multiple numbers. This indicates that North Korea is capable

of launching Scuds and Nodongs from any place and at any

time, from which it is deemed that it has increased confidence

in the performance and reliability of its ballistic missiles.

As for Scuds and Nodongs, since the August 2016 Nodong

launch, there have been launches where it is presumed that

warheads fell in Japan’s EEZ, posing a major threat to Japan’s

security. The four ballistic missiles, apparently Scud ERs,

launched on March 6, 2017, were launched simultaneously.

It is possible that through these launches, North Korea’s

intentions are not only research and development of ballistic


missiles but also the enhancement of their operational

capabilities. Since Chairman Kim Jong-un has repeatedly

instructed the military troops to reject formality and conduct

practical training, it can be considered that these instructions

underpin the launches of ballistic missiles that have already

been deployed.

Some have noted that a ballistic missile which appears to

have been modified from the Scud missile launched in May

2017 is equipped with a MaRV. Furthermore, images of the

2019 ballistic missile launches published by North Korea

show that the missiles were launched from different places

and hit the specific target.

This suggests that North Korea is aiming to enhance the

accuracy of attack by upgrading ballistic missiles that have

already been deployed and developing new ballistic missiles.

Furthermore, in the short-range ballistic missile launches

on November 28, 2019 and March 2, 2020, the interval

between launching the two missiles on both occasions was

estimated at less than 1 minute, suggesting that North Korea

is trying to improve the continuous fire capability required

for saturation attacks and the like.

In recent years, North Korea also appears to have been

striving to improve its practical operational capabilities,

conducting target practice using a combination of new

SRBMs and various types of artillery.

Thirdly, North Korea appears to be seeking to improve

its ability to conduct surprise attacks by enhancing secrecy

and instantaneity to make it difficult to detect signs of a

launch. Using a TEL or submarine, a ballistic missile can be

launched from any point, making it difficult to detect signs

of a launch in advance. North Korea has repeatedly launched

ballistic missiles from TELs and SLBMs. In addition, all

the ballistic missiles launched in 2019 appear to use solid

fuel. It is therefore believed that North Korea is proceeding

with the development of solid-fueled ballistic missiles.

Generally solid fuel-propelled ballistic missiles are pre
loaded with solid fuel, and therefore, they can be launched

instantly and the signs of their launch are more difficult to

detect. Furthermore, they can be reloaded more quickly, and

they are relatively easier to store and handle in comparison

to liquid fuel-propelled missiles. In this respect, they are

considered to be superior militarily. From these factors,

North Korea is deemed to be aiming to enhance its surprise

attack capabilities.

Fourthly, North Korea could possibly be developing

ballistic missiles that fly at low altitudes on irregular

trajectories, in an attempt to breach other countries’ missile

defense networks. The SRBMs launched in 2019 on May 4

and 9, July 25, and August 6 have a shape similar to that of the

Russian short-range ballistic missile “Iskander,” which is said

to be able to fl y at a lower altitude than conventional ballistic


missiles and on an irregular trajectory. The prevailing view

is that missiles which fl y at lower altitudes than conventional

ballistic missiles and on an irregular trajectory, such as the

“Iskander,” are designed to breach missile defense networks.


-----

Fifthly, North Korea may be attempting to diversify the

forms of launches. It has been confirmed that the June 22,

2016, May 14, July 4, July 28, and November 29, 2017,

and October 2, 2019 ballistic missile launches used a lofted

trajectory, in which missiles are launched to high altitudes at

higher angles than normal. Generally, when a launch is made

on a lofted trajectory, interception is considered to be more

difficult.

North Korea is proceeding with ballistic missile

development at an extremely rapid pace and is believed

already to have the ability to attack Japan with nuclear

weapons fitted to Nodong and Scud-ER ballistic missiles,

within whose range our nation lies. Furthermore, North Korea

has developed more advanced missile-related technologies in

recent years. The three types of SRBMs that are presumed

to be new models and have been involved in a series of

launches since May 2019 are distinctive in that they use solid

fuel and fly at lower altitudes than conventional ballistic

missiles. North Korea is therefore believed to be trying to

breach missile defense networks by making it more difficult

to detect signs of a launch and making early detection harder.

There are concerns that such advanced technologies will be

applied to longer-range missiles.

Thus, North Korea is relentlessly pursuing increasingly

complex and diverse modes of attack and is steadily

strengthening and improving its attack capabilities. These

enhancements in its capabilities make early detection of the

signs of a launch and the interception of the missiles more

difficult, thereby posing new challenges for the information

gathering, early warning, and interception postures of

relevant countries, including Japan.

c. Future Outlook for Ballistic Missile Development

At the Plenary Meeting of the Central Committee of the

KWP in April 2018, Chairman Kim Jong-un announced the

suspension of ICBM test launches. Then, at the U.S.-North

Korea summit meeting in June, he clearly expressed the

intention to work towards denuclearization. However, at the

December 2019 Plenary Meeting of the Central Committee

of the KWP, Chairman Kim stated that, since the United

States was holding U.S.-ROK joint military exercises, there

were no grounds for North Korea to be unilaterally bound

any longer by a commitment that no other party honors. He

also announced the intention to continue developing strategic

weapons until the United States rolls back its hostile policy

towards North Korea.

Given these points, it will be necessary to continue to


development program.


**4** Domestic Affairs

（1） Developments Related to the Kim Jong-un Regime

In North Korea, the power base centered on Chairman Kim

is being solidified. The constitution was amended in April

and August 2019, strengthening Chairman Kim’s authority

through such provisions as the stipulation that the Chairman

of the State Affairs Commission is “the supreme leader of

the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea who represents

the state.” Since the transition to the new regime, there has

been a number of announcements of party-related meetings

and decisions, and in May 2016, the Seventh KWP Congress

was held for the first time since the last Congress in October

1980, 36 years earlier. These developments suggest that the

state is run under the leadership of the party.

On the other hand, with senior officials unable to dispute

the decisions of Chairman Kim Jong-un due to an atrophy

effect created by the frequent executions, demotions, and

dismissals of senior officials, it is believed that there is

growing uncertainty, including over the possibility of North

Korea turning to military provocations without making

adequate diplomatic considerations. In addition, it has been

suggested that there is declining social control caused by

widening wealth disparities and information inflow from

other countries. In this regard, attention will be paid to the

stability of the regime.


**Chapter**


（2） Economic Conditions

In the economic domain, North Korea has been facing

chronic stagnation and energy and food shortages due

to the vulnerability of its socialist planned economy and

diminishing economic cooperation with the former Soviet

Union and East European countries following the end of

the Cold War. Especially for food, it is deemed that North

Korea is still forced to rely on food assistance from overseas.

Furthermore, the strengthening of sanctions by countries

including Japan and the United States, and the sanctions of

the related UN Security Council resolutions in response to

the implementation of nuclear tests and missile launches can

be assumed to have had a certain effect, when considered

together with the severe economic situation of North Korea.

Accordingly, if China, North Korea’s largest trading partner,

and other relevant countries continue to rigorously implement

sanctions, an even more severe economic situation could

number of measures to prevent infection with the novel

coronavirus, such as halting the tourism and the operation

of international rail and air services, which suggests that it

might be suffering economic losses.[24]

To tackle a host of economic difficulties, North Korea has

made attempts at limited improvement measures and some

changes to its economic management systems, and promotes

the establishment of economic development zones and the

enlargement of the discretion of plants and other entities

over production and sales plans. Furthermore, at the Plenary

Meeting of the Central Committee of the KWP in December

2019, Chairman Kim stated that North Korea should take

an offensive for making a breakthrough head-on aimed

at neutralizing the sanctions and pressure by the hostile

forces and opening a new avenue for socialist construction,

declaring the economy to be the key. It therefore appears that

North Korea regards the rebuilding of the economy as being

of paramount importance. Nevertheless, as North Korea is

unlikely to carry out any structural reforms that could lead

to the destabilization of its current ruling system, it faces

various challenges in making fundamental improvements to

its current economic situation.

North Korea is presumed to be evading the UN Security

Council sanctions by conducting ship-to-ship transfers on

the high seas, which are forbidden under the terms of the

UN Security Council resolutions.[25] The final report of the

UN Security Council’s Panel of Experts assisting the North

Korea Sanctions Committee, released in April 2020, pointed

out that in 2019, North Korea illicitly imported a volume

of petroleum products far in excess of the cap set by UN

Security Council resolutions.

See Fig. I-2-3-7 (Sanctions based on UN Security Council Resolutions

against North Korea)


strengthening economic sanctions and diplomatic measures.

In response, North Korea repeated its previous assertions that

developing its own nuclear deterrent capability was necessary

in order to respond to the nuclear threat posed by the United

States, and continued to engage in provocative rhetoric and

behavior, coupled with military provocations such as ballistic

missile launches.

In June 2018, the historic first-ever U.S.-North Korea

summit meeting was held and both sides confirmed that they

would join their efforts to build a lasting and stable peace

regime on the Korean Peninsula. Chairman Kim Jong
un made clear his intention to work towards the complete

denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula, and confirmed that

negotiations would continue with the United States.

However, the second U.S.-North Korea summit meeting

in February 2019 ended without any agreement being

reached between the two countries. At the Supreme People’s

Assembly in April 2019, Chairman Kim Jong-un stated

that he was ready to hold a third U.S.-North Korea summit

meeting on the condition that the United States find out “with

a proper attitude a methodology that can be shared with us”

and that North Korea would “wait for a courageous decision

from the U.S. till the end of this year.”

When President Trump visited the ROK in June 2019, he

met the North Korean leader at Panmunjom and they agreed

to proceed with dialogue at the working level. A working
level meeting took place that October, but North Korea

subsequently announced that talks had broken down.

At the December 2019 Plenary Meeting of the Central

Committee of the KWP, Chairman Kim stated that, since

the United States was holding U.S.-ROK joint military

exercises, there were no grounds for North Korea to be

unilaterally bound any longer by a commitment that no other

party honors. He also announced that there will never be

denuclearization on the Korean Peninsula, and that North

Korea will continue developing strategic weapons until the

United States rolls back its hostile policy towards North

Korea. Furthermore, Chairman Kim remarked that North

Korea would maintain its nuclear deterrence against the

United States’ nuclear threat and that the scope and depth of

the buildup of the deterrent would be coordinated depending

on the future approach of the United States.

However, no concrete progress has yet been observed in

（2）Relations with the ROK

Chairman Kim’s remarks in his January 2018 New Year

Address on the need for inter-Korean dialogue triggered

substantial progress in inter-Korean relations that year. The

inter-Korean summit meeting was held in April, resulting

in the issuance of the Panmunjom Declaration, which

confirmed among other matters that the two parties agreed

to completely cease all hostile acts against each other in

every domain, and confirmed the common goal of realizing a

nuclear-free Korean Peninsula. In addition, in another inter
Korean summit meeting held in May, Chairman Kim Jong
un reiterated his desire for the complete denuclearization

of the Korean Peninsula. Furthermore, at the inter-Korean

summit meeting in September, Pyongyang Joint Declaration

of September 2018, which referred to an ending of military

hostilities, was issued. In addition, the “Agreement on the


Implementation of the Historic Panmunjom Declaration in

the Military Domain,” which prescribed concrete measures

to ease inter-Korean military tensions, was signed. In

2018, North and South Korea conducted activities related

to the implementation of the measures based on these

documents. The Panmunjom Declaration also notes that the

two countries will aim to declare an end to the Korean War,

and the Pyongyang Joint Declaration of September 2018

notes that Chairman Kim Jong-un will visit Seoul soon. In

March 2020, the ROK presidential office announced that

President Moon Jae-in had received a letter from Chairman

Kim. However, 2019 saw no major advances in inter-Korean

dialogue and cooperation programs, unlike the year before.

Moreover, North Korea has frequently issued remarks critical

of the ROK of late. For example, it has used statements

by the foreign ministry press secretary to criticize ROK’s

efforts to upgrade its defense capability and the U.S.-ROK

joint military exercises held in March and August 2019. In

addition North Korea frequently demonstrates an attitude


-----

inimical to dialogue with its southern neighbor, with North

Korean media reporting that, although President Moon had

asked Chairman Kim to attend the November 2019 ASEAN
ROK Commemorative Summit, the North Korean leader had

refused, on the grounds that a purely ceremonial face-to-face

meeting between the two leaders would be worse than no

meeting at all. Future developments in inter-Korean relations

will be closely watched.


March 2018 the first-ever China-North Korea summit

meeting under the leadership of Chairman Kim Jong-un was

held. Chairman Kim’s visit to China for this meeting marked

the first time that he had traveled abroad since taking over the

leadership. Chairman Kim Jong-un made visits to China in

May and June 2018, and in January 2019, and held meetings

with President Xi. In addition, President Xi visited North

Korea in June 2019 for the first time since he was appointed

President, and held a meeting with Chairman Kim Jong-un.

They reportedly had discussion on the development of the

relationship between two countries and denuclearization of

the Korean Peninsula.

（4）Relations with Russia

Concerning North Korea’s nuclear issue, Russia, along

with China, has expressed support for the denuclearization

on the Korean Peninsula and early resumption of the Six
Party Talks. Although Russia endorsed UN Security Council

Resolution 2397, adopted in December 2017, it emphasized

that pressure on North Korea should make way for dialogue

and negotiations. In December 2019, Russia and China

together circulated among UN Security Council members a

draft resolution proposing adjustments to sanctions imposed

by Security Council resolutions.

Following the U.S.-North Korea summit meeting in

June 2018, Russia has continued to demonstrate an active

stance in supporting political and diplomatic processes

in the vicinity of the Korean Peninsula and has called on

relevant countries to give consideration to consultations in

a multilateral format. In April 2019, Chairman Kim Jong-un

visited Vladivostok and held a meeting with President Putin

to exchange opinions on the development of the bilateral

relationship and the Korean Peninsula situation. In addition,

President Putin is said to have accepted Chairman Kim’s

invitation to visit North Korea.


（3）Relations with China

The China-North Korea Treaty on Friendship, Cooperation

and Mutual Assistance, which was concluded in 1961, is still

in force. In addition, China is currently North Korea’s biggest

trade partner. In 2018, trade volume between China and

North Korea was very large, accounting for approximately

90% of North Korea’s total trade (excluding trade between

North Korea and the ROK),[26] suggesting North Korea’s

dependence on China.

With regard to the situation in North Korea and its nuclear

issue, China has expressed support for denuclearization

on the Korean Peninsula, for peace and stability on the

Korean Peninsula, and solving problems through dialogue

and consultations. While it has endorsed the series of UN

Security Council Resolutions, which strengthen sanctions on

North Korea. It has also stated that sanctions alone will be

unable to achieve a fundamental solution to the nuclear issue

and that a solution should be found through dialogue and

consultations. In this respect, China has expressed support

for the U.S.-North Korea dialogue, including U.S.-North

Korea summit meetings. China, as well as North Korea and

Russia, insists that denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula

should be gradual and simultaneous, with relevant countries

taking corresponding measures. In December 2019, China

and Russia together circulated among UN Security Council

members a draft resolution proposing adjustments to

sanctions imposed by Security Council resolutions.

China is a vital political and economic partner for North

Korea and maintains a degree of influence on the country.

Although it has been noted that China-North Korea relations

had deteriorated because North Korea did not necessarily

take actions that were in accordance with China’s position.

For example, North Korea repeatedly conducted nuclear

and ballistic missile tests despite opposition from the

international community including China. However, in

（5）Relations with Other Countries

Since 1999, North Korea has made efforts to establish

relations with a series of West European countries and others,

including the establishment of diplomatic relations with

European countries and participation in the ARF ministerial

meetings. Meanwhile, it has been reported that North Korea

has cooperative relationships with countries such as Iran,

Syria, Pakistan, Myanmar, and Cuba in military affairs

including arms trade and military technology transfer.


-----

In recent years, North Korea is deemed to be strengthening

its relations with African countries. The underlying purposes

for enhancing relations with these countries include the usual

objective of deepening political and economic cooperation.

In addition, it appears that North Korea hopes to acquire

foreign currency by expanding its arms trade and military

cooperation with African countries – activities which are

becoming increasingly difficult due to sanctions based on

UN Security Council resolutions and political turmoil in

the Middle East. It is actually the case that transactions that

violate the terms of UN Security Council Resolutions have

been observed,[27] and the possibility that North Korea’s illegal

activities could provide a funding source for nuclear and

ballistic missile development is a cause for concern.

- 

the designation of the country as an enemy was eliminated.

Instead, the white paper states as follows: “The Republic

of Korea’s armed forces regard any forces that threaten and

encroach upon our sovereignty, territory, people and assets

as our enemies.” In addition, the white paper emphasizes the

importance of omni-directional response to security threats.

The ROK has continued to undertake reforms of its

national defense. In recent years, in July 2018, the ROK

released the “Defense Reform 2.0,” which has set the

following three main goals: making omni-directional

response to security threats, enhancing military power based

on advanced science and technology and developing armed

forces appropriate for a developed country. This plan calls for

continued promotion of efforts to secure combat capabilities

necessary for responding to the threat from North Korea and

also includes the reduction of the troops and the mandatory

military service period.


**1 General Situation**


**Chapter**


With regard to its North Korea policy, the Moon Jae-in

administration, which was inaugurated in May 2017, is

placing emphasis on improving the inter-Korean relationship

and easing tensions based on the Panmunjom Declaration,

issued at the inter-Korean summit meeting in April 2018 and

Pyongyang Joint Declaration of September 2018, issued at

the inter-Korean summit meeting in September of the same

year. How the North Korea policy of the Moon administration

will impact inter-Korean relations will continue to require

close attention.

The U.S. Forces, mainly the Army, have been stationed

in the ROK since the ceasefire of the Korean War. The ROK

has established very close security arrangements with the

United States primarily based on the U.S.-ROK Mutual

Defense Treaty. The U.S. Forces Korea have been playing an

important role in securing peace and stability of the region

such as playing a vital role in deterring the outbreak of large
scale armed conflict on the Korean Peninsula.

**2** Defense Policies and Defense Reform of the ROK


**3** Military Posture of the ROK

The ROK’s military capacity is as follows. The ground forces

consist of 21 army divisions and 2 marine divisions, totaling

460,000 personnel; the naval forces consist of 240 vessels

with a total displacement of approximately 255,000 tons;

and the air forces (Air Force and Navy combined) consist of

approximately 620 combat aircraft.

The ROK has been modernizing its military forces— not

only its Army but also its Navy and Air Force—in order to

establish an omni-directional defense posture to deal with

future potential threats, not least threats from North Korea.

The Navy has been introducing submarines, large transport

ships, and domestically built destroyers. The Air Force is

currently promoting a program for the installation of the

F-35A as a next-generation fighter with stealth property.

In November 2017, the ROK Government announced a


The ROK has a defensive weakness, namely, its capital

Seoul, which has a population of approximately 10 million,

is situated close to the DMZ. The ROK has set the National

Defense Objective as follows: “to protect the country from

external military threats and invasions, to support peaceful

unification, and to contribute to regional stability and world

peace.” As one of the “external military threats,” the ROK,

in its Defense White Paper, used to designate North Korea

as the “main enemy” or state that “the North Korean regime

and its armed forces…will remain as our enemies.” In the

ROK Defense White Paper 2018, published in January

2019, while continuing to describe North Korea’s WMDs as

a threat to the peace and stability of the Korean Peninsula,

revision of its missile guidelines, which were agreed by the

U.S. and ROK governments in 1979 and stipulate the range

of ballistic missiles it possesses; the revision included the

elimination of warhead weight limits on ballistic missiles,

in order to enhance deterrence against military provocation

by North Korea. Furthermore, to address North Korean

nuclear and missile threats, as well as expanding the missile

capabilities of the ROK Forces, the ROK is engaging in

efforts to build a “strategic strike system,” which would use

missiles and other means to launch rapid preemptive strikes

directly targeting the North Korean command, and also a

missile defense system called Korea Air and Missile Defense

(KAMD). In addition, the focus of defense has changed from

responding to the threat of North Korean missiles to an omni
directional response to security threats.

In terms of ballistic missiles, the ROK appears to

have operationally deployed Hyunmoo-2 missiles with

an estimated range of 300-800 km and is believed to be

developing new ballistic missiles, following the abolition

of warhead weight limits in the 2017 revision of the missile

guidelines. With regard to cruise missiles, the ROK appears

to have operationally deployed the Hyunmoo-3 surface-to
surface cruise missile, which is believed to have a range

of about 500-1,500 km, and Haeseong series ship-to-ship/

ship-to-surface cruise missiles, which are believed to have

a maximum range of 1,000-1,500 km. The Dosan Ahn

Changho submarine and the arsenal ship expected to be

introduced under the 2020-2024 mid-term defense plan will

reportedly be equipped with ballistic missiles in the future.

In recent years, the ROK has actively promoted equipment

export which reached approximately US$3 2 billion on a


contract value basis in 2017. Since 2006, the amount has

increased by nearly 13-fold in 11 years. It is reported that

export items have diversified to include communication

electronics, aircraft, and naval vessels.

Defense spending in FY2020 (regular budget) increased

by about 7.4% from the previous fiscal year to nearly KRW

50.1527 trillion, marking the 21st consecutive year of

increases since 2000. According to the Defense Reform 2.0,

the ROK will increase the defense budget 7.5% on an annual

average.

See Fig. I-2-3-8 (Changes in the ROK’s Defense Budget)

**4** U.S.-ROK Alliance and U.S. Forces Korea


The United States and the ROK have taken various steps to

deepen the U.S.-ROK Alliance in recent years.

While regularly confirming the strengthening of the U.S.
ROK Alliance at the summit level, as specific undertakings,

the two countries signed the U.S.-ROK Counter-Provocation

Plan for dealing with North Korea’s provocations in March

2013, and approved the Tailored Deterrence Strategy,

designed to enhance deterrence against North Korean nuclear

and other WMD threats, at the 45th Security Consultative

Meeting (SCM) in October of the same year. At the 46th SCM

in October 2014, the two countries agreed on “Concepts and

Principles of ROK-U.S. Alliance Comprehensive Counter
missile Operations (4D Operational Concept)” to tackle

North Korean ballistic missile threats. At the 47th SCM in

November 2015, the implementation guidance on the 4D

Operational Concept was approved. Additionally, after North

Korea went ahead with its nuclear test in January 2016, the


-----

United States and the ROK officially decided to deploy

THAAD[28] to U.S. Forces Korea in July 2016, concluding

the temporary deployment of it in September. In addition,

in a U.S.-ROK summit meeting also held in September, the

enhanced deployment of U.S. strategic assets in and around

the ROK on a rotational basis was agreed.

With regard to U.S.-ROK joint military exercises, the two

countries announced in June 2018 that, in light of progress

in dialogue with North Korea, the U.S.-ROK joint military

exercise “Freedom Guardian” planned for August had been

suspended, along with two U.S.-ROK Marine Exchange

Program training exercises scheduled to occur within the next

three months. In October, they announced the cancellation

of the Vigilante Ace, a regular air force exercise conducted

in November-December in usual years, in order to provide

every possible opportunity to continue the U.S.-North Korea

diplomatic process. Furthermore, in March 2019, they

announced the “conclusion” of the Key Resolve and Foal

Eagle exercise, which has been conducted in March-April

in usual years, and the implementation of Alliance (Dong

Maeng), a combined command exercise. They also carried

out a combined command exercise in August 2019, but did

not clearly disclose its size or name. That November, the

United States and the ROK announced the postponement

of a U.S.-ROK joint air exercise, as an act of goodwill to

contribute to an environment conducive to diplomacy and the

advancement of peace. In February 2020, they announced the

postponement of U.S.-ROK joint exercises to curb the spread

of the novel coronavirus outbreak.

At the same time, the two countries have worked to deal

with such issues as the transition of operational control

(OPCON) to the ROK[29] and the realignment of U.S.

Forces Korea. For the transition of OPCON to the ROK,

the roadmap for the transfer “Strategic Alliance 2015”

was established in October 2010. Aiming to complete the

transition by December 1, 2015, the two countries have

reviewed the approach of transitioning from the existing

combined defense arrangement of the U.S. and ROK Forces,

to a new joint defense arrangement led by the ROK Forces

and supported by the U.S. Forces. Nevertheless, based on the

increasing seriousness of North Korea’s nuclear and missile

threats, the two sides decided at the 46th SCM to re-postpone


the transition of OPCON, and to adopt a conditions-based

approach, i.e., implementing the transition when conditions

such as the ROK Forces’ enhanced capabilities are met.

The ROK plans to develop core military competencies for

deterrence against and response to the threats from nuclear

weapons and missiles, which are required for the transition

of OPCON, by 2023. At the 50th SCM in October 2018,

it was decided that following the transition of OPCON,

an ROK military officer will serve as commander of the

Future Combined Forces Command, replacing the current

arrangement of a U.S. military officer serving as the

commander of the U.S.-ROK Combined Forces. It was

also decided that regarding the ROK Forces’ operational

capabilities, their Initial Operating Capability (IOC) will be

assessed in 2019. In August 2019, an IOC assessment was

carried out during a combined command exercise. At the

51st SCM in November 2019, the two parties concurred that

the exercise had played an important role in verifying IOC

and decided to pursue an assessment of Full Operational

Capability for the Future Combined Forces Command in

2020.

With regard to the realignment of the U.S. Forces Korea,

an agreement had been reached in 2003 on the relocation

of the U.S. Forces’ Yongsan Garrison located in the center

of Seoul to the Pyeontaek area, south of Seoul, and on the

relocation of the U.S. Forces stationed north of the Han

River to the south of the river. Subsequently, however, the

agreement has been partially revised, due to various factors,

including: the relocation to the Pyeontaek area being delayed

due to logistical reasons such as increases in relocation costs;

in relation to the postponement of the transition of OPCON, it

has been necessary for some U.S. Forces personnel to remain

at Yongsan Garrison; and it was decided that the counter-fires

forces of U.S. Forces Korea would remain in their location

north of the Han River to counter the threat of North Korea’s

long-range rocket artillery. In July 2017 the U.S. Eighth

Army headquarters relocated to the Pyeontaek area, and in

June 2018 the headquarters of U.S. Forces Korea and UN

Command also relocated to the same area. The realignment

of U.S. Forces Korea could have a significant impact on U.S.

and ROK defense postures on the Korean Peninsula, and

as such it will be necessary to follow future developments

a hotline and continue to maintain close communication, as

well as vitalizing high-level strategic dialogue. The ROK

Defense White Paper 2018 also makes clear that the ROK

will strengthen strategic communication with China.

（2）Relations with Russia

The ROK and Russia have agreed on cooperation in the

areas of military technology, defense industry, and military

supplies. In 2012, the two countries held the fi rst ROK
Russia defense strategic dialogue and agreed to regularize

the dialogue. In November 2013, President Vladimir Putin

visited the ROK, and a joint statement was issued in which

the two sides agreed to strengthen dialogue in the areas of

politics and security.

In June 2018, President Moon Jae-in visited Russia as a

state guest, becoming the fi rst ROK president to do so in 19

years. In August 2018, defense strategic dialogue was held,

and it was agreed that the dialogue will be upgraded to the

vice minister level and that a hotline will be established

between the two countries’ air forces.

On the other hand, Russia opposes the deployment of

THAAD by U.S. Forces Korea for the reason that it is part

of the U.S. missile defense network and harms the strategic

stability of the region.

above the sea areas surrounding the reef, Ieodo (Chinese

name: Suyan Rock), regarding which China and the ROK

have confl icting claims to the jurisdictional authority over

the EEZ. Against this backdrop, the ROK Government

announced the expansion of its own ADIZ in December 2013

and enforced it from the same month. The ROK is protesting

that Chinese aircraft are repeatedly intruding into the ROK’s

ADIZ.

**❶ [General Situation ]**

President Vladimir Putin, who has been seeking the revival

of Russia as a strong and infl uential power, successfully

achieved reelection in 2018. In his inaugural address in May

of that same year, President Putin stated that Russia is a

strong, active and infl uential participant in international life,

and that the country’s security and defense capability are

reliably secured. He also stated that quality of life, wellbeing,

security and health were his main goals, and that Russia has

risen like a phoenix a number of times throughout history,

and believes it would achieve a breakthrough again.

At the annual presidential address to the Federal

Assembly of Russia in March of that same year, held prior to

the presidential election, President Putin said, “Russia ranks

among the world’s leading nations with a powerful foreign

economic and defense potential.” At that same time, President

Putin talked about modernizing Russia’s military equipment,

including its strategic nuclear forces, and emphasized that

Russia would be developing new weapons as a measure in

response to the deployment of missile defense systems by

the United States domestically and abroad. President Putin

also expressed the recognition that Russia’s military power

helped maintain strategic parity in the world, and remarked

that Russia is prepared to negotiate toward construction

of a new system for international security and sustainable

development of civilization.

However, the INF Treaty came to an end in August 2019,

following the United States’ notifi cation of its intention

to withdraw from the pact—which became the fi rst-ever

convention on the abolition of a specifi c type of weapon when

it was concluded with the United States during the Soviet

era—on the grounds that Russia had violated the treaty.

Russia and the United States subsequently each announced

their intention to develop intermediate-range missiles.

See Section 1 of this Chapter (The United States)

Since the 2014 Ukrainian crisis, Russia has faced a

diplomatically diffi cult situation, with its right to attend

meetings of the leaders of the Group of Seven major nations

(G7 Summits) being suspended and the country being subject

to economic sanctions. However, a phenomenon that could

be dubbed “sanctions fatigue”—the inability to continue

bearing the economic burden of the prolonged imposition of


sanctions—has emerged among some of the countries with

a close economic relationship to Russia. On the other hand,

Russia’s ability to withstand sanctions has been growing,

as it has promoted import substitution, while on the foreign

policy front, President Vladimir Putin has taken the stance

that “there are other organizations which play an important

role in world affairs” and the country has been demonstrating

a growing presence in the G20 and multilateral diplomatic

forums in which Western countries do not participate, such

as the SCO and the association of fi ve major emerging

economies (BRICS: Brazil, Russia, India, China, and South

Africa).

In addition, Russia’s presence in the military fi eld in the

Middle East and Africa has been growing. Russia has been

conducting military intervention in Syria since September

2015. Russia has indicated that it has the ability to swiftly

and continually deploy military assets in remote areas while

acquiring bases in Syria. Russia has signed a memorandum of

understanding with Turkey on the establishment of a DMZ.

Russia’s growing involvement in the Syrian situation will

attract attention as a move aimed at expanding its infl uence

in the Middle East. In September 2019, Minister of Defence

Sergei Shoigu stated that “Russia’s military intervention

in the Syrian confl ict signifi ed not only the liberation of

Syria, but also Russia’s return to global politics and the

multipolarization of the modern world.”

That October, Russia dispatched two Tu-160 strategic

bombers to South Africa for the fi rst time, and held the fi rst

trilateral joint exercise involving the navies of Russia, China,

and South Africa off the coast of South Africa the following

involving the navies of Russia, China, and Iran took place in

the northern Indian Ocean.

Russia has been expanding the range of countries to which

it exports weapons, including promoting sales of the latest

weapons to NATO member Turkey.

Amid this situation, in January 2020, President Putin

proposed to the State Duma a constitutional amendment bill

that included changes to the president’s term of offi ce. With

some remarking that this is an effort by President Putin to

lay the groundwork for a regime after the end of his term of

offi ce in 2024, developments in Russia will be the focus of

attention as the president’s term of offi ce draws to a close.

addition, the doctrine expresses growing alarm, defi ning the

following as new military risks: NATO’s military buildup;

the realization of the U.S. Global Strike concept; rise of

global extremism (terrorism); formation of governments

in neighboring countries that carry out policies threatening

Russia’s interests; and the incitement of ethnic, social, and

religious confrontations in Russia.

The doctrine positions nuclear weapons as an essential

component for preventing the outbreak of nuclear wars

and military confl icts that use conventional weapons, and

states that Russia will maintain an adequate level of nuclear

deterrent capability. Additionally, it states that Russia

reserves the right to use nuclear weapons in retaliation not

only for the use of nuclear or other WMDs, but also in the

event of invasion using conventional weapons, where the

survival of the country itself is imperiled.

Furthermore, defending Russian interests in the Arctic

was newly added as one of the military’s tasks in peacetime.

The Strategy for the Development of Maritime Activities

of the Russian Federation up to 2030, which was revised

in August 2019 in accordance with Russia’s Maritime

Doctrine (approved in July 2015), makes clear that, as a “key

priority for the long-term development of Russia’s maritime

activities,” Russia will “strive for the development [of naval

units], with the objective of providing them with strategic

non-nuclear deterrent capabilities.”

As for Russia’s defense budget, whereas the amounts

**Chapter**


**1** Basic Posture

Against the backdrop of foreign policy factors, including the

Ukrainian crisis and the military intervention in Syria, Russia

set out its objectives and strategic priorities of domestic and

foreign policies in the “National Security Strategy” revised

in December 2015.

The National Security Strategy construes that Russia

has an increasingly greater role in a multipolarizing world.

The Strategy perceives increased activity of NATO and

expansion of its member states as threats to national security,

and expresses its vigilance against the U.S. deployment of

missile defense (MD) systems to Europe and the Asia-Pacifi c

region for undermining global and regional stability.

In the defense domain, the Strategy commits to giving

continued priority to the role fulfi lled by Russia’s military

force, and to ensuring strategic deterrence and preventing

military confl ict by maintaining a suffi cient level of nuclear

deterrent capability and combat readiness of Russian military

forces, including the Armed Forces of the Russian Federation

(AFRF).

The Military Doctrine, revised in December 2014 as

a document substantiating the principles of the National

Security Strategy in the military sphere, states the existing

view that while the probability of an outbreak of a large-scale

war is decreasing, military risks to Russia are increasing, such

as the movement of NATO’s military infrastructure closer to

Russia’s borders including the expansion of NATO, and the

establishment and deployment of strategic MD systems. In

Russia has implemented full-scale military reform since

1997 by presenting the three pillars of reform: downsizing;

modernization; and professionalization. Moreover, Russia is

advancing measures including troop reductions, structural

reform (from the division-based command structure to a

brigade-based one), strengthening of combat readiness, and

modernization of the AFRF such as the development and

introduction of new equipment.

Regarding the downsizing of the military forces, it was

decided that AFRF would have a strength of one million

personnel as of 2016. Since December 2010, Russia

reorganized its six military districts into four military

districts (Western, Southern, Central and Eastern Districts).

On this basis, Russia established a joint strategic command

in each military district and is carrying out integrated

operations of its entire military forces, such as the ground

force, naval force, and aerospace forces under the control

of the Military District Commander. In December 2014, the

Northern Joint Strategic Command in charge of the Arctic

became operational.

Regarding the modernization of the military forces,

Russia has been working to increase its percentage of new

equipment to 70% by 2020, and announced in December

2019 that it had increased said proportion to an average of

60-65% across the whole military. In addition, the share of

modern weapons in the nuclear triad (ICBM, SLBM, and

strategic bombers) is believed to have reached 82%.

Regarding the professionalization of the military forces,

in order to make the combat readiness of the permanent

readiness units effective, Russia promotes the introduction

of a contract service system (for noncommissioned officers

and soldiers) which selects personnel who would serve under

contracts from the conscripted military personnel. In 2015,

the number of contract servicemen exceeded the number of

conscripted personnel for the first time, and in the future the

percentage of contract servicemen is set to increase further.

**1** Nuclear Forces


Russia’s military forces are comprised of forces such as the

AFRF, the Border Guard Service of the Federal Security

Service of the Russian Federation (FSB), and the Federal

National Guard Service of the Russian Federation. The AFRF

consists of three services and two independent forces: Land

Forces; Navy; Aerospace Forces; Strategic Missile Forces;

and Airborne Forces.

Russia emphasizes its nuclear forces to secure its global

position, to strike a balance with the nuclear forces of the

United States and to supplement its inferiority in conventional

forces. It is thus believed that Russia is making efforts to

maintain readiness.

Russia still possesses ICBMs, SLBMs, and long range

bombers (Tu-95 Bears and Tu-160 Blackjacks) comparable

to the United States in scale.

Russia is obligated to reduce strategic nuclear arms

pursuant to the New Strategic Arms Reduction Treaty

concluded with the United States. Russia is working on

accelerating the development and introduction of new

weapons under the policy to prioritize the modernization of

nuclear forces based on the State Armaments Program (GPV:

Gosudarstvennaya Programma Vooruzheniya).

In 2011, Russia started the deployment of “Yars”

ICBM, which is considered a multi-warhead version of the

“Topol-M” ICBM. It is currently developing the “Sarmat”

heavy ICBM, which is believed to be capable of carrying

a warhead with the capability to breach missile defense

systems. Three Borey-class SSBN vessels, which carry the

new-type SLBM “Bulava,” were commissioned. There are

plans to deploy four such vessels each to the Northern Fleet

and Pacifi c Fleet in the future.

As for non-strategic nuclear forces, Russia scrapped

ground-launched short- and intermediate-range missiles with

a range of between 500 and 5,500 km by 1991 in accordance

with the INF Treaty with the United States, and the following

year removed tactical nuclear weapons from naval vessels

for storage onshore. Russia, however, still possesses a broad

array of other nuclear forces and has in recent years been

moving forward with deployments of the “Iskander” ground
launched ballistic missile system, which is believed to be

capable of carrying either conventional or nuclear warheads,

and the “Kalibr” SLCM system.

As well as commenting on Russia s breaches of the

INF Treaty since May 2013, the United States repeatedly

demanded that the country return to compliance with the

treaty. However, Russia consistently denied violating the

treaty and has criticized the United States, saying that it is

itself in breach of the INF Treaty, on the grounds that Aegis

Ashore is equipped with a system capable of launching

Tomahawk cruise missiles. Thus, with the United States and

Russia remaining as far apart as ever, the treaty ended in

August 2019. Russia confi rmed that the treaty ceased to have

effect due to the United States’ complete withdrawal, and

criticized the United States by saying that all the responsibility

for escalating tensions across the world will rest with

Washington. Furthermore, Russia stated that it is essential

to resume full dialogue to safeguard strategic stability and

security, and that Russia is open to that. However, Russia

declared that they would take steps to counteract the threat

if the United States deployed ground-launched intermediate
range missiles in the Asia-Pacifi c region. Developments

involving the deployment of ground-launched intermediate
range missiles will need to be watched closely, as they could

have a major impact on the security environment surrounding

Japan.

**2** Conventional Forces and Other Issues


Space Situational Awareness (SSA) through the use of the

International Science Optical Network’s (ISON) optical

telescopes, while also promoting the development of anti
satellite weapons, such as the “Nudol” anti-satellite missile

system, for which multiple launch tests are said to have

been conducted. Since 2013, Russia has put satellites into

both low and geostationary orbits to conduct rendezvous and

proximity operations (RPO), which have repeatedly been

observed engaging in frequent RPO with other countries’

satellites on geostationary orbits. Russia is also suspected of

stepping up activities using weapons of electronic warfare,

with accusations that AFRF based on the Kola Peninsula in

the Arctic Circle jammed GPS signals while the major NATO

military exercise Trident Juncture was taking place in 2018.

the development, procurement, and deployment of new

equipment, such as the “Su-57” currently under development

as the so-called “fi fth generation fi ghter” and the T-14 Armata

tank, in addition to the introduction of the Su-35 fi ghter and

the surface-to-surface missile system “Iskander.” In August

2019, the Russian Ministry of Defence announced that the

heavy unmanned combat aerial vehicle “Okhotnik” had

successfully completed its fi rst fl ight. As some have remarked

that the “Okhotnik” could conceivably breach anti-aircraft

defenses in combination with the Su-57 fi fth-generation

fi ghter, close attention will need to be paid to developments

involving these new items of equipment. The Russian Navy

currently has one conventional powered aircraft carrier, but

reportedly plans to acquire a nuclear-powered aircraft carrier

by the end of 2030.

The AFRF has also been stepping up its activities in the

realms of space and electromagnetic spectrum in recent

years. In addition to its own early warning facilities and

other radar equipment, Russia has been increasing its

other countries outside its borders. In 2019, it held joint

exercises with Laos and South Africa.

A plan is underway to construct or rebuild 10 airfi elds in

the Arctic, and in November 2019, Russia announced that it

had installed radar capable of detecting stealth fi ghters and

hypersonic vehicles on the archipelago of Novaya Zemlya.

In the Arctic, the AFRF has not only resumed the operation

of such military facilities, but has also been conducting such

activities as strategic nuclear deterrence patrols by SSBN and

patrol fl ights by long-range bombers. For example, Tu-95 and

Tu-160 long-range bombers have frequently been observed

fl ying through international airspace off the Alaskan coast

and over the Barents Sea and Norwegian Sea.

In addition, the AFRF continues to operate several

permanent bases within Syria, though in December 2017

it largely terminated the military operations that it had

conducted in Syria since 2015.


**3** New Weapons


Talking about priorities for 2019, President Putin mentioned

the need for modern strategic nuclear forces with enhanced

missile defense system penetration capabilities, as well

as laying emphasis on future mass production of the HGV

“Avangard.” That February, President Putin ordered that

half-yearly progress reports be provided on the development

and deployment of new weapons, including the “Avangard”

HGV, the “Sarmat” ICBM, and the “Kinzhal” air-launched

ballistic missile (ALBM). Additionally, he revealed for the

fi rst time that Russia was developing the “Zircon,” a sea
launched hypersonic cruise missile that is believed to have a

fi ring range of over 1,000 km and be capable of speeds up to

approximately Mach 9.

In August 2019, an explosion killed several Russian

Ministry of Defence personnel and state nuclear energy

corporation staff at a Russian military facility near

Arkhangelsk in northern Russia. As a special ship for

transporting radioactive material was present in nearby

waters at the time of the accident, it has been suggested that

the AFRF was testing the “Burevestnik” nuclear-powered

cruise missile that it is currently developing.

**4** Trends Related to the AFRF


**Chapter**


Since 2010, the AFRF has been conducting large-scale

round-robin exercises in each military district, with the

objective of verifying the combat readiness of the military

districts, etc. These exercises are helping to improve the

long-distance mobilization capability of the AFRF. The

large-scale Tsentr 2019 military exercise was held in

September 2019, primarily in the Central Military District,

with the involvement of approximately 128,000 personnel,

around 600 aircraft, 15 ships, and more than 20,000 military

vehicles. Like the previous year’s Vostok 2018 exercise in

the Russian Far East, China also participated, as did India,

Pakistan, and a number of Central Asian countries. In October

2019, the Grom strategic command-post exercises took place

at training grounds in each region under President Putin’s

leadership. During these exercises, ballistic missiles were

fi red from nuclear submarines in the Barents Sea and Sea of

Okhotsk, and also from the Plesetsk space base. The Russian

Ministry of Defence oversaw the exercise and announced

that all tasks prescribed in the strategic nuclear deterrence

training process had been completed.

Russia also conducts joint training and exercises with

all of its combat forces into permanent readiness units.

The Eastern Military District now consists of ten brigades

and two divisions with approximately 80,000 personnel in

total as well as a marine brigade equipped with amphibious

operations capability. The Eastern Military District has

introduced new equipment, such as the “Iskander” surface
to-surface missile system, “Bal” and “Bastion” surface-to-ship

missiles, and the “S-400” surface-to-air missile system.


**1** General Situation

Russia newly established the Eastern Military District and

the Eastern Joint Strategic Command in 2010. Land Forces,

the Pacifi c Fleet, and the Air Force and Air Defense Units

have been placed under the Military District Commander,

who conducts unifi ed operation of these services.

The current presence of the AFRF in the Far East region

is signifi cantly smaller than it was at its peak. However, a

considerable scale of military forces, including nuclear

forces, still remains in the region. Russian armed forces

in the vicinity of Japan are generally increasing activity,

including the trend related to deployment of new units and

military facility development.

Given that the AFRF set their basis of operation on

maintaining the combat readiness of their strategic nuclear

units and dealing with confl icts through the intertheater

mobility of its round-the-clock readiness units, it is necessary

to keep our attention on the positioning and trends of the

AFRF in the Far East region while also keeping in mind the

trends of units in other regions.

As for strategic nuclear forces in the Far East region, one Delta

III-class SSBN and two Borey-class SSBNs equipped with

SLBMs are deployed in and around the Sea of Okhotsk, and

approximately 30 Tu-95 long-range bombers are deployed

in Ukrainka. Russia is prioritizing the reinforcement of its

maritime strategic deterrence posture which had been greatly

scaled-down compared to the former Soviet Union, and as

part of these efforts, it plans on deploying four Borey-class

SSBNs to the Pacifi c Fleet by 2020.

long distance voyages have been carried out by Pacifi c Fleet

vessels, along with assigned missions involving operations

in Syria and patrols by nuclear-powered submarines. In

September 2018, 28 naval vessels including a Slava-class

guided missile cruiser passed through the Soya Strait. This

was the largest number of vessels announced by the Ministry

of Defense (MOD) as having transited this strait at the same

time since the end of the Cold War. Additionally, survey

activities have taken place on Matsuwa Island located roughly

in the middle of the Chishima Islands, with the objective of

studying the feasibility of deploying Pacifi c Fleet’s forces

there in the future, and it is said that a new runway has been

completed on that island as well. It is also pointed out that

bases will be constructed on Matsuwa Island as well as

Paramushir Island, located in the north of Chishima Islands,

and that there are plans to deploy Bal and Bastion surface
to-ship missiles there. Attention must be paid to movement

towards the construction of a coastal defense system covering

the Northern Territories and Chishima Islands. In August

2019, it was reported that a number of Bastion batteries had

been deployed on Matsuwa Island.

Regarding aircraft, since the resumption of the patrol

activities by its strategic aviation units in 2007, Russia has

been increasing fl ights by long-range bombers. Also, there

were fl ights of Tu-95 long-range bombers refueled in mid
fl ight and supported by A-50 early warning and control


**（4）Air Forces**

In the Eastern Military District, Russia deploys approximately

400 combat aircraft from its Aerospace Forces and Navy

combined. Existing models are being modernized and new

models, such as the Su-35 fi ghters and the Su-34 fi ghter
bombers, are being introduced to improve their capabilities.


**Chapter**


**2** Operations in the Vicinity of Japan

In the vicinity of Japan, the AFRF has been generally

increasing its activities, including exercises and drills which

are believed to be conducted for objectives such as verifying

the results of the military reform.

In September 2018, Vostok 2018, considered the largest

since 1981, was carried out in the Eastern Military District.

According to a Russian Defense Ministry announcement,

approximately 300,000 personnel, 36,000 tanks and other

vehicles, 80 vessels, and 1,000 aircraft participated in the

exercise. The participating units undertook long-distance

maneuvers over distances of up to 7,000 km, while vessels

of the Northern Fleet sailed up to 4,000 nautical miles. The

Chinese and Mongolian militaries also participated in the

exercise. Vostok 2018 is positioned as an annual strategic

military exercise hosted in turn by each of four military

districts and is regarded as an initiative aimed at giving the

participating military forces the capacity to engage in large
scale confl icts with military superpowers over a short period

and the ability to wield infl uence over potential enemies.

Notable features of this year’s exercise were the size of the

units deployed and the participation of countries other than

Russia’s allies.

The number of exercises carried out by the Russian Land

Forces in the areas adjacent to Japan has decreased from the

peak. However, its activities are generally increasing.

With regard to naval vessels, their activities are generally

increasing in recent years. For example, various exercises and

in 2019, with one flight around Japan and three incursions

into Japanese airspace confirmed to have occurred. In June

2019, two Tu-95 long-range bombers flew around Japan, and

intruded into Japan’s territorial airspace twice when they flew

northward over the Pacific Ocean. In July of the same year,

two Russian Tu-95 long-range bombers carried out “first

Russia-China joint air patrol” with two Chinese H-6 bombers

from the Sea of Japan to the East China Sea. In addition, one

Russian A-50 early warning and control aircraft allegedly

supporting Tu-95 long-rage bombers intruded into Japan’s

airspace above the territorial waters of Takeshima Island in

Shimane Prefecture. In February 2020, two Su-34 fighter
bombers were observed flying over the Sea of Okhotsk for


the first time.

**❺ [Russian Forces in Japan’s Northern Territories]**


Since 1978 during the former Soviet Union era, Russia

has redeployed ground troops on Kunashiri, Etorofu, and

Shikotan Islands of the Northern Territories, which are

inherent territories of Japan. While the Russian troop strength

is thought to be far less than that at peak times, one division is

still stationed in Kunashiri and Etorofu Islands. Furthermore,

tanks, armored vehicles, various types of artillery, and anti
air missiles are deployed.

Russia has been proceeding with the development of

military facilities in the Northern Territories in recent years.

In November 2016, Russia announced that it deployed

coastal (surface-to-ship) missiles to Etorofu and Kunashiri

Islands. In January 2018, the new civilian airport built in

2014 in Etorofu Island in addition to Tennei military airfield

was opened up to joint military and civilian use, with three

Su-35 fighter aircraft reportedly deployed to the new airport

in August 2018. Russia also continues to carry out military

exercises on islands that can include the Northern Territories.

In October 2019, the Eastern Military District announced

that drills to repel landings by a hypothetical enemy assault

force were to be held in the Sakhalin and Primorsky regions,

involving up to 8,000 personnel, more than 3,000 units

of tanks and military equipment, and up to 50 planes and

helicopters. It was also reported that in April 2020, a tactical

exercise involving about 30 naval and other vessels of the

Pacific Fleet was held in waters including the vicinity of


Etorofu and Kunashiri Islands.

As described above, Russia continues to station AFRF

in the Northern Territories, which are inherent territories

of Japan, and has recently been increasing the AFRF’s

activities in the territories under de facto occupation. Some

point out that such developments reflect the Russian people’s

heightened awareness of territorial integrity due to the

Ukrainian crisis, as well as the rising military importance of

the Northern Territories adjacent to the Sea of Okhotsk, an

operating area of SSBN.

During the Japan-Russia Foreign and Defense Ministerial

Meeting (2+2) held in May 2019, Japan stated that the

military build-up in the Northern Territories by AFRF is

inconsistent with Japan’s legal positions. In addition, Japan

expressed a concern about the vigorous activities of Russian

military aircraft around Japan and called for a calm response

from Russia. Closer attention must be paid to Russian

military movements in the Far East, including the Northern

Territories.

**1** General Situation


weapons that are said to be capable of reliably penetrating

missile defense systems.

However, since the United States suspended military

exchanges with Russia in March 2014 over the Ukrainian

crisis, there have been frequent instances of both countries’

aircraft and ships coming into close proximity with each

other. In June 2019, a near-miss occurred in the Philippine

Sea between a U.S. Forces ship and an AFRF ship, after

which the United States and Russia criticized each other for

their dangerous actions.

The United States is also demonstrating increasingly

vigilance over Russian activities in space. In February

2020, United States Space Command (USSPACECOM)

commander Gen. John Raymond described recent Russian

satellite behavior as “unusual and disturbing” and criticized

Russia for activities that “do not reflect the behavior of a

responsible spacefaring nation.” In addition, in April 2019,

he announced that Russia had conducted an anti-satellite

weapons test, noting that this was “further proof of Russia’s

hypocritical advocacy of outer space arms control proposals

designed to restrict the capabilities of the United States while

clearly having no intention of halting its own counterspace

weapons programs.”

See Chapter 3, Section 6 (Transfer and Proliferation of Weapons of
Mass Destruction)

**3** Relations with China


Russia considers the realization of its national interests as

a guiding principle of its foreign policy, recognizing the

multipolarization of international relations, the shift of global

power to the Asia-Pacific region, and the growing importance

of force in international relations.[2] Moreover, based on its

National Security Strategy, Russia engages in open, rational,

and pragmatic diplomacy to protect its national interests.

It aims to pursue multidirectional diplomacy by ruling

out futile confrontation and acquiring as many partners as

possible around the world.

Furthermore, Russia aspires to deepen its relations with

the Asia-Pacific countries, seen as drivers of the global

economy, and in recent years, has attached importance to

China and India. Moves to strengthen collaboration with

China in particular have been seen since the Ukrainian crisis,

seemingly in inverse proportion to the deepening of Russia’s

conflict with Western countries.

Meanwhile, Russian efforts to strengthen its cooperative

relations with the West are still facing challenges after

the Ukrainian crisis. However, with regard to the Syrian

situation, Russia is exploring the possibility of cooperation

with other countries towards stabilizing Syria and countering

international terrorist organizations, including ISIL.

Attention will be paid to how Russia would balance its

posture of economic-centered and benefit-focused foreign

policy with Russia’s politics and diplomacy including

security in order to develop its relations with other countries.

**2** Relations with the United States


**Chapter**


Russia continues to advance close military cooperation

with China. Export agreements on new armaments such as

the S-400 surface-to-air missile system and Su-35 fighter

jets were concluded in 2015, and since 2012, Russia and

China have been conducting joint naval exercise “Joint Sea.”

Most recently, in July 2019, two Russian Tu-95 long-range

bombers flew with two Chinese H-6 bombers from the Sea

of Japan to the East China Sea. Russia and China called this

joint flight the “first Russia-China joint air patrol” conducted

in line with the annual military cooperation plan between

the two countries. A package of documents on military and

military-technical cooperation were signed at a meeting of

the Russia-China Intergovernmental Joint Commission on

Military-Technical Cooperation held in Moscow September


President Putin has striven to deepen cooperative relations

with the United States in the economic domain, while

opposing the United States on any action Russia considers as

“a U.S. attempt to encroach on Russia’s strategic interests.”

On the military front, feeling that the United States’

installation of missile defense systems both at home and

abroad—including in Europe and the Asia-Pacific—

undermines global and regional security, Russia has criticized

these moves for upsetting the strategic balance. Russia is

also moving forward with the development of new strategic

Amid this situation, Volodymyr Zelensky became

President of Ukraine in May 2019 and expressed the desire to

resolve the dispute with Russia and improve the relationship

between the two countries, whereupon a spokesperson for

the Russian president took the position that the normalization

of their relations was up to Ukraine. That December, a

four-party summit involving Russia, Ukraine, France, and

Germany, aimed at resolving the confl ict in eastern Ukraine,

took place for the fi rst time in three years in Paris and the

parties agreed to a complete ceasefi re and the exchange of

(CIS) as one of its most important foreign policy objectives.

Russia considers that its vital interests are concentrated in

the territories of the CIS, and deploys its troops in Moldova

(Transnistria), Armenia, Tajikistan, Kyrgyzstan, and Georgia

(South Ossetia, Abkhazia), which withdrew from the CIS in

August 2009 announced its withdrawal from CIS. Through

the conclusion of an alliance and strategic partnership treaty

with Abkhazia in November 2014, the conclusion of an

alliance with South Ossetia in 2015, and other efforts, Russia

has been working to ensure its military influence.

Due to increasing activities by Islamic armed insurgents

in Central Asia and the Caucasus, Russia has been pursuing

military cooperation primarily on counterterrorism

measures in the region, and organized the Collective Rapid

Deployment Force in May 2001 within the framework of

the CIS Collective Security Treaty Organization (CSTO).[4]

Furthermore, in June 2009, a permanent joint rapid reaction

The two countries have completed joint development of the

developing the hypersonic cruise missile “BrahMos-II.” In

March 2019, the two countries signed a deal for the lease

of another Akula-class nuclear-powered attack submarine,

joining the other Akula-class submarine that India has been

leasing since 2012. Another example of the ongoing wide
ranging military cooperation between Russia and India is

the joint exercise “INDRA,” which has been taking place

since 2003 with the involvement of the armies and navies of

both countries, with their air forces also taking part in recent

years.

Regarding the North Korean nuclear issue, in December

2019, Russia and China together circulated among UN

Security Council members a draft resolution that included

the partial lifting of sanctions based on Security Council

resolutions.

In addition, Russia has been moving ahead with defense

cooperation with Laos in the field of procurement of

equipment and mine and unexploded ordnance disposal in

recent years. In December 2019, Russia held Laros 2019,

its first joint army exercise with the country, with the

involvement of more than 500 personnel, including tank

Regarding the relationship with Japan, Russia states

that it will develop mutually beneficial cooperation and is

intensifying its approach in many fields including politics,

economy and security.

**（2） Relations with Asian Countries**

Russia recognizes that the significance of the Asia-Pacific

region is increasing within its multi-pronged foreign policy,

and considers it strategically important to strengthen its

status in the region from the viewpoint of socioeconomic

development in Siberia and the Far East, and security. To

achieve strategic stability and equal strategic partnerships,

Russia places particular emphasis on developing a

comprehensive partnership relationship and strategic

cooperative relationship with China as a key factor in

maintaining global and regional stability, and also intends

to assign an important role for the privileged strategic

partnership with India.

In 2018, Russia concluded agreements to supply India

with new armaments such as the S-400 surface-to-air


**（3） Relations with European Countries**

Through the framework of the NATO-Russia Council

(NRC), Russia has worked with NATO as an equal partner

in the areas of common interest, such as by participating in

certain decision-making processes. However, following the

Ukrainian crisis in 2014, NATO and European countries

suspended their practical cooperation with Russia,

including that in the military domain, except for the NRC’s

ambassador-level meetings. Although NATO has issued

statements criticizing Russia over the Ukrainian situation and

has deployed additional military capacity in Eastern Europe


In May 1992, leaders of six countries (Armenia, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Russia, Tajikistan, and Uzbekistan) signed the Collective Security Treaty (CST) in Toshkent, Uzbekistan. In 1993,
Azerbaijan, Georgia and Belarus joined the treaty, which came into effect in April 1994. However, Azerbaijan, Georgia, and Uzbekistan withdrew from the treaty in 1999 without renewing it.

and the Baltic states, there are differences among member

countries in their enthusiasm for NATO’s response to Russia.

Nevertheless, Russia has maintained its assertive

diplomatic behavior, with President Putin stating during a

July 2019 official visit to Italy that there are “always chances”

to restore relations, but “many things will also depend on

Europe.”

Russia is also stepping up the pace of dialogue, with

the 2+2 joint foreign and defense ministerial consultations

between Russia and France taking place for the first time in

seven years in Moscow in September 2019.

Russia revealed that it has deployed two army divisions

near the border with Ukraine, and one army division near

its border with Belarus, and Russia conducted the strategic

command and staff exercise Zapad 2017 in its Western

Military District and Belarus in September 2017. That

exercise was brought up at the NRC meeting held in October

of that same year, where it was pointed out that the number

of actually participating soldiers and the area used for the

exercise were larger than indicated in the announcement

made by Russia prior to the exercise. However, there were

no invasions into other countries by Russia, and no Russian

units stayed in Belarus following the exercise, which were

points of concern.

Russian military aircraft have stepped up their activities

in the airspace surrounding the Baltic states, where NATO

has deployed military capacity. In July 2019, the U.K. Royal

Air Force Air Chief Marshal Stephen Hillier disclosed that

the U.K. fighters frequently scramble in response to Russian

activity over the Baltic Sea. Chief of Staff of the U.S. Air

Force David Goldfein, too, acknowledged that AFRF activity

around the Baltic states is on the rise.


by promoting initiatives that aim for political resolutions in

the future.

In December 2017, President Putin visited a Russian

military base in Syria, where he announced that the fight

against terrorism in the country had been largely resolved,

that Russia would continue to operate two permanent bases

within Syria, and that he had decided that most of the Russian

forces in Syria would be redeployed back to Russia.

Russia continues to maintain a presence in Syria, with the

Russian Ministry of Defence announcing in November 2019

that it had deployed helicopter units at Qamishli airport in

northeastern Syria, as well as at its Khmeimim Air Base.

The objectives of Russian military intervention may

include: (1) to sustain the Assad administration which

is friendly to Russia; (2) to defend Russian interests

including its military bases in Syria; (3) to address the

threat of international terrorist organizations including

ISIL; and (4) to secure influence in the Middle East. Thus

far, Russia seems to have contributed to the recovery of

the Assad administration’s areas of control and protecting

Russian interests. Additionally, operations in Syria using

cruise missiles and strategic bombers have provided the

ideal setting to demonstrate Russia’s long-range precision

strike capabilities. Considering the significant influence of

Russia’s military intervention on the course of the Assad

administration, coupled with the expanding partnerships

between Russia and surrounding countries such as Turkey

and Iran, Russia’s influence on future stability in Syria and

on the political settlement process cannot be ignored.

While supporting opposing sides in the Syrian conflict,

Russia and Turkey coordinate their interests to avoid direct

confrontation. When U.S. Forces announced their withdrawal

from northern Syria in October 2019, the two countries

agreed that Russian military police and the Turkish army

would carry out joint patrols in northern Syria. In January

2020, the foreign and defense ministers of the two countries

held a meeting in Moscow to discuss the Libyan situation.

During this meeting, representatives of the interim Libyan

Government of National Accord led by Fayez al-Sarraj

and the powerful military organization that opposes it, the

Libyan National Army (LNA), attended peace talks. Russia

is thus increasing its influence over both the Syrian situation

and peace in Libya, while at the same time coordinating its

interests with Turkey.

Summit in Sochi and also dispatched two Tu-160 strategic

the Caspian Sea and Mediterranean. In December 2016, a

nationwide ceasefire agreement brokered by Russia and

Turkey took effect between the Assad administration and

opposition forces. While Russia has continued to fight ISIL

air missile systems to China. It has been pointed out that

this deal was made possible because the interests of China

and Russia coincided: while China promotes indigenous

weapons production, it still needs Russian technology for

state-of-the-art equipment, whereas Russia aims to avoid

diplomatic isolation caused by the Ukrainian crisis and to

gain economic profi t through arms exports. In recent years,

Russia has been aggressively marketing its arms to allies and

partners of the United States, including Turkey and Saudi

Arabia, in addition to traditional export destinations. In

particular, the export of S-400 to Turkey, a member country

of NATO, has met with strong opposition from the United

States. Furthermore, Russia has revealed that it is prepared to

export to Turkey not only Su-35 fi ghters, but also the Su-57

fi fth-generation fi ghter.


**Chapter**


Russia seems to actively promote the export of arms not only

to maintain the infrastructure of its military industry and to

make economic profi t, but also to help promote better foreign

policy. The country’s export value has been increasing in

recent years.[5] In January 2007, the Russian Government

granted the exclusive authority to export arms to the

Rosoboron Export State Corporation as part of its ongoing

initiatives to improve its export system. In addition, Russia

regards its military industry as an integral part of the nation’s

military organization and is committed to improving and

further developing the military industry by such measures

as promoting the integration of aircraft companies such as

Sukhoi, MiG, and Tupolev.

Russia exports equipment such as fi ghters, vessels and

surface-to-air missiles to countries including Asia, Africa,

and Middle East. In recent years, Russia has exported 24

security environment over the next two decades, it outlines
the direction of Australia’s defense strategy for dealing with
this environment, and the development of the defense force
pursuant to this strategy.
Specifi cally, the white paper maintains that while there
is little prospect of a military attack on Australian territory
in the period to 2035, Australia will face new complexities
and challenges. Based on this understanding, three strategic
defense interests are identifi ed, namely: a secure, resilient
Australia (including the security of sea lanes); a secure
nearer region; and a stable Indo-Pacifi c region and a rulesbased global order. Additionally, the following three strategic
defense objectives are given: (1) Deter, deny, and defeat
attacks on or threats to Australia and its national interests;
(2) Make military contributions to support the security
of maritime Southeast Asia and support the governments
of Pacifi c Island countries to build and strengthen their
security; and (3) Contribute military capabilities to coalition
operations that support Australia’s interests in a rules-based
global order. To maintain the ADF’s high level of capability
needed to achieve these objectives, the Government will
make important investments. In addition to increasing the
troop strength by approximately 4,400 personnel, Australia
will acquire high performance equipment, including 12 new
submarines, three air warfare destroyers (Aegis vessels),
72 F-35 Joint Strike Fighters, and seven MQ-4C unmanned
patrol aircraft. Simultaneously, Australia will seek to
strengthen intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance
(ISR) capabilities, electronic warfare capabilities, and
cybersecurity capabilities, as well as strengthen the functions
of its bases in northern Australia and elsewhere. To support
these programs by funding, the white paper also presents the
concrete target of increasing defense funding to reach 2% of
GDP by 2020.

**3 Relations with Other Countries**


Australia maintains a special strategic partnership with
Japan and shares universal values, such as strategic interests,
respect for freedom and human rights, democracy, and the
rule of law. Japan’s relationship with Australia is becoming
more important than ever before.
The Defence White Paper released in February 2016 sets
out a plan to continue to increase troop strength and acquire
high performance equipment over the next two decades,
to maintain the high level of capability of the Australian
Defence Force (ADF). The white paper states explicitly that
defense funding would be increased over the next decade,
setting a specifi c target of 2% of Australia’s GDP to be
reached by 2020. With regard to Australia’s international
relationships, the white paper sets forth that Australia would
aim to mature and deepen practical engagement with partners
across the Indo-Pacifi c, including Japan, while continuing to
give highest priority to its alliance with the United States.
To achieve its strategic defense objective of contributing
military capabilities to coalition operations that support
Australia’s interests in a rules-based global order, Australia
makes proactive contributions to the peace and stability of
the international community through the deployment of ADF
to overseas operations, among other efforts.

**2 Security and Defense Policies**


**Chapter**


The Australian Government launched its fi rst National
Security Strategy in January 2013. The Strategy provides
a blueprint for national security over the next decade,
presenting the recognition that responding to the economic
and strategic changes in the Asia-Pacifi c region is vital to
the national security of Australia. The Strategy defi nes four
objectives for the country’s national security: (1) to ensure
a safe and resilient population; (2) to protect and strengthen
Australia’s sovereignty; (3) to secure Australia’s assets,
infrastructure and institutions; and (4) to promote a favorable

international environment.[1]

The Defence White Paper released in February 2016
sets out the Australian Government’s future plans for
national defense and the means by which they will be
implemented. After presenting an outlook of Australia’s


In the Defence White Paper 2016, Australia subscribed to

on this view, Australia will build and maintain international
security relationships to achieve its strategic defense

objectives. In particular, Australia will aim to mature and
deepen practical engagement with partners across the IndoPacifi c region, including Indonesia, Japan, the ROK, New
Zealand, India, and China, while continuing to give the
highest priority to its alliance with the United States. On
November 2017, Australia published the 2017 Foreign
Policy White Paper for the fi rst time in 14 years.

See Part III, Chapter 3, Section 1-2-1 (Australia)

See


（1）Relations with the United States

In the Defence White Paper 2016, Australia states that its
alliance with the United States pursuant to the Security
Treaty between Australia, New Zealand and the United States
of America (ANZUS)[2] is based on shared values and will
continue to be the centerpiece of Australia’s defense policy.
Australia notes that the United States, which remains the preeminent global military power over the next two decades,
will continue to be its most important strategic partner, and
the active presence of the United States will continue to
underpin the stability of the region. It is stated that Australia
thus welcomes and supports the critical role of the United
States in ensuring stability in the Indo-Pacifi c region.
Since 1985, the two countries have been regularly
convening the Australia-United States Ministerial
Consultations (AUSMIN) to discuss major diplomatic and
security issues.
In their joint statement at the AUSMIN held in July 2018,
the United States and Australia made their commitment
to work together to shape an “Indo-Pacifi c that is open,
inclusive, prosperous, and rules-based,” welcomed the
recent U.S.-Australia-India-Japan consultations on the IndoPacifi c, reaffi rmed their commitment to strengthen trilateral
dialogue with Japan. At the AUSMIN in July 2019, serious
concerns about continued militarization in the South China
Sea and the Pacifi c were also expressed. In addition, both
sides emphasized the importance of Australia-U.S. defense
cooperation in the Indo-Pacifi c region, indicating the policy
to deepen cooperation with Japan, India, the United Kingdom,
France, Germany and other countries. Furthermore, they
committed to further support Southeast Asian and the Pacifi c
Island countries, and cooperation to maintain pressure on
North Korea.
The military forces of the United States and Australia
strive to improve interoperability through bilateral exercises.
Exercise Talisman sabre is the Australian-U.S. bilateral
military exercise conducted biennially since 2005, with the
objective of enhancing combat readiness and interoperability.
The 2019 exercise was the biggest to date, with more than


34,000 personnel participating from not only the United
States and Australia, but also Canada, New Zealand, and the
United Kingdom, as well as the SDF. It included amphibious
operations and ground combat training.
In November 2011, the United States and Australia
announced the Force Posture Initiatives, which encompass the
rotational deployment of U.S. Marines in northern Australia,
the enhancement of access to Australian military facilities
and areas by U.S. Air Force aircraft, and the expansion of
opportunities for joint exercises and training. Under these
initiatives, the rotational deployment of U.S. Marines in
northern Australia began in April 2012, with approximately
2,500 Marines deployed in the region as of 2019. It is also
reported that under these initiatives, U.S. Air Force B-52
strategic bombers and F-22 fi ghters deployed to Australia as
needed to participate in training. Australia is in the process
of formulating and implementing plans to enhance facilities,
airfi elds, and training grounds at bases used by U.S. Forces,
including Darwin and Tindal.

（2）Relations with China

In the Defence White Paper 2016, Australia states that its
relationship with China is crucial in different ways from its
relationship with the United States, and that it welcomes
China’s continued economic growth and the opportunities
this is bringing for Australia and other countries in the IndoPacifi c. It goes on to say Australia is committed to continuing
the development of Australia’s defense relations with China,
and working to enhance mutual understanding, facilitate
transparency, and build trust.
Based on such policy, Australia and China continuously
hold dialogues among their defense authorities, along with
exchanges to develop the cooperative relations between their
defense forces, including joint exercises and mutual visits by
vessels.
Meanwhile, Australia has been showing its wariness
toward China, by, among other ways, making Australia’s
position on China very clear.
The Australian government expressed strong concerns
over China’s recent land reclamation and construction
activity in the South China Sea, and called on all claimant
states to halt militarization, while also clearly expressing its
intention to continue to exercise its rights to free navigation
and fl ight. Furthermore, the 2017 Foreign Policy White Paper
contained statements to the effect that China is challenging
the position of the United States in the Indo-Pacifi c, the most
important region for Australia.

People within and outside Australia expressed their
concerns over the acquisition by Chinese businesses of
Australian facilities, including Port Darwin, a port that has
been used by Australian and the United States fleets among
others. In January 2017, the federal government of Australia
announced the establishment of the Critical Infrastructure
Centre to serve as a dedicated body that will identify
facilities requiring surveillance and carefully manage the
risks for advising related institutions in order to block the
sale of important infrastructure related to national security,
including specific ports and harbor facilities, to companies
from other countries. The Centre manages the risks arising
from foreign involvement by assessing the risks of sabotage,
espionage and coercion in Australia’s critical infrastructure
sectors, including telecommunications, electricity, gas, water
and ports.
With China’s perceived influence on Australia growing
larger, including cases of political figures and parties
receiving huge political contributions and bribes, the
Australian Parliament passed a bill to prevent interference
in domestic affairs by foreign actors. The Australian
government announced that an Australian company would
receive government support and accept an underwater
telecommunication cable network project that was to
be partially conducted by a Chinese telecommunication
company Huawei previously. Moreover, in August 2018,
Huawei revealed that the company and ZTE were banned from
bidding in an Australian 5G (advanced telecommunication
system) network project by the Australian government.

（3）Relations with India

In the Defence White Paper 2016, Australia states that
it welcomes India’s increasingly active role in the IndoPacific region, and that it sees India as a key security partner.
Australia notes that it aims to further mature its defense
relationship with India in support of their shared strategic
interests.
The Australia-India relationship was elevated to a strategic
partnership in November 2009, and the two countries have
regularly conducted strategic dialogues, mutual visits by
senior military officers, interactions among military services,
and mutual dispatches of students to military educational
organizations. In November 2014, Prime Minister of India
Narendra Modi visited Australia, marking the first visit
to Australia by an Indian Prime Minister in 28 years. The
two leaders agreed to extend defense cooperation to cover
research, development, and industry engagement, to hold
regular meetings at the level of Defense Minister and conduct
regular maritime exercises, and to convene talks between


each of their military services. Since then, mutual exchanges
between Australia and India have steadily progressed through
such initiatives as mutual visits of naval ships and joint navy
training exercises.

（4）Relations with Southeast Asia and Pacific Island
Countries

In the Defence White Paper 2016, Australia regards a secure
nearer region encompassing maritime Southeast Asia and
South Pacific as its strategic interest. In particular, Australia
considers that instability and conflicts in Southeast Asia have
the potential to threaten Australia’s security and economic
relations with countries. Furthermore, Australia depends
on maritime trade with Southeast Asian countries and
maritime trade that transits Southeast Asia. In this regard,
Australia perceives that the security of these sea lanes
must be ensured alongside freedom of navigation. Based
on this understanding, Australia seeks to make military
contributions to support the maritime security of Southeast
Asia and support the governments of Pacific Island and other
countries in building and strengthen their security.
Australia has been deepening its relations with Indonesia
in the security and defense fields following the signing of
the Lombok Treaty—a security cooperation framework
concerning cooperation in a wide range of defense fields—
in November 2006, the elevation of their relationship to a
strategic partnership in March 2010, and the September 2012
conclusion of the Defence Cooperation Arrangement, which
included the enhancement of cooperation in the fields of antiterrorism measures and maritime security. The two countries’
cooperative relations in the security and defense fields have
stalled intermittently. However, since mutual visits by
ministers and higher-level officials resumed in the second
half of 2015, the bilateral relationship has been improving
through many initiatives, including regular Foreign and
Defense Ministerial Meetings (2+2) and the signing of an
agreement on maritime security and terrorism, and of a
Maritime Cooperation Plan of Action in 2018.
With Singapore and Malaysia, Australia carries out
regular joint combined exercises in the South China Sea and
other areas under the Five Power Defence Arrangements
(FPDA; entered into force in 1971) framework, whereby
Australia, New Zealand, and the United Kingdom would
consult each other in the event or threat of an armed attack
on Singapore or Malaysia, to decide on their response.
Australia considers that Singapore is its most advanced
defense partner, and that they share Australia’s interest in a
secure maritime trading environment. Defense cooperation is
also deepening, including the signing of a memorandum of

（5）Overseas Activities

In the Defence White Paper 2016, Australia identifies
the following strategic defense objective: to contribute
military capabilities to coalition operations that support
Australia’s interests in a rules-based global order. In line
with this objective, the ADF is deployed overseas to conduct
operations.
Australia has deployed one E-7A airborne early warning
and control aircraft and one KC-30A aerial refueling aircraft
to the Middle East to provide support for anti-terrorism
operations being conducted by the United States, among
others. In Iraq, it is engaged in advising and assisting, as
well as providing capacity building assistance to the Iraqi
Security Forces on the military front. In Afghanistan, ADF
personnel train, advise, and assist NATO-led Afghan forces.
Australia also deploys aircraft and naval vessels to conduct
maritime surveillance in the Strait of Hormuz and other parts
of the Middle East, as well as in the Indian Ocean, the South
China Sea, and around Pacific Island countries.
Since 2018, ADF patrol aircraft and vessels engaged in
patrolling and monitoring activities against illegal maritime
activities, including illicit ship-to-ship transfers by North
Korean ships, which is prohibited under the UN Security
Council resolution.

other priorities, including capabilities to operate effectively

with the United States, the United Kingdom, Australia, and
Canada, and the maintenance of the scale and quality of New
Zealand’s military contributions.
Moreover, the Statement was the first document that
mentioned the impact of climate change and the role of
the New Zealand Defence Force (NZDF) regarding this
issue, which reflects the new administration’s Pacific Reset
strategy, which makes a commitment to support the Pacific
Island countries that have been exposed to disasters. As for
the issues in the South China Sea, New Zealand had refrained
from referring to China by name in order to maintain its
neutral position in this matter. However, in the Statement,
the country made a comment on China’s militarization in the
South China Sea, stating, “China’s more confident assertion
of its interests has at times raised tensions with neighboring
states and with the United States.”
As for diplomatic relations, New Zealand has maintained
close relationships with the United States and Australia
based on the ANZUS Treaty In particular New Zealand


understanding concerning military training and training area
development in Australia under the comprehensive strategic
partnership in October 2016. As regards Malaysia, Australia
stations the ADF in Royal Malaysian Air Force (RMAF)
Base Butterworth, and contributes to maintaining regional
security and stability through patrol activities in the South
China Sea and the northern Indian Ocean.
Australia plays a leading role in assisting Pacific Island
countries, and Timor-Leste in fields such as security
maintenance, coping with natural disasters, and maritime
patrol. In particular, in the field of maritime patrol, Australia
still regularly deploys ADF assets to the South Pacific to assist
with patrol activities. It also plans to supply the Pacific Island
countries and Timor-Leste with 21 new Guardian-class patrol
boats by 2023. In November 2018, Australia announced
its largest ever financial package of up to AUS$3 billion
for infrastructure development in Pacific Island countries,
with the intent of further strengthening relations. In May
2019, immediately after forming his Cabinet following the
general election, Prime Minister Scott Morrison expressed
his intention to continue active engagement with the
Pacific Island countries, called “Pacific Step-up”. He made
his first official trip overseas after the cabinet forming to
Solomon Islands in June 2019, showing his stance of placing
importance on the Pacific Island countries.

**❷ [New Zealand]**

In July 2018, New Zealand announced a new defense policy,

the Strategic Defence Policy Statement 2018. This document
refers to major changes in the strategic environment since
the publication of the previous Defence White Paper in 2016,
including intensifying competition among powers, climate
change, and cyber and space.
The Statement then presented New Zealand’s security
objectives, specifically, ensuring public safety, preserving
sovereignty and territorial integrity, protecting lines of
communication and the like, strengthening international order,
sustaining economic prosperity, maintaining democratic
institutions and national values, and protecting the natural
environment. In order to achieve these objectives, New
Zealand prioritizes the securing of operational capabilities
in the primary operation area that stretches from the South
Pole to the Equator. The country believes that challenges to
the existing order of the Asia-Pacific region could impact its
security and prosperity and that it is important to have defense
capabilities that can globally support the maintenance of the
international rule based order The Statement also mentioned

sees Australia as its closest partner. The United States has
suspended its defense obligation to New Zealand since
1985, when New Zealand refused the entrance of a U.S.
ship following New Zealand’s ban on nuclear weapons.
Nevertheless, the two countries have strengthened their
relationship in the diplomacy and defense fields through the
Wellington Declaration (2010), which primarily focuses on
strengthening strategic relations in the fields of foreign policy
and military affairs, and the Washington Declaration (2012),
which mainly deals with expanding defense cooperation.
New Zealand has thus established the United States as a very
close strategic partner. While New Zealand has deepened
its relationship with China through such initiatives as
cooperation for the “Belt and Road” Initiative and joint air
exercises, it also looks at China with a cautious eye as shown
in the Strategic Defence Policy Statement 2018.
The NZDF has 9,400 personnel.[3] It has contributed to

the peace and stability of the region through such activities
as engaging in monitoring and surveillance activities by
patrol aircraft against illegal maritime activities, including
illicit ship-to-ship transfers involving North Korean-flagged
vessels prohibited under the UN Security Council resolution,
and dispatching its personnel to the United Nations
Command Military Armistice Commission (UNCMAC) in
the ROK, and to other operations in the Middle East and the
South Pacific.
In June 2019, the New Zealand government published
“Defence Capability Plan 2019,” which sets out planned
investments of NZ$20 billion until 2030. Investments
under the Plan are: strengthening of the relationship with
the Pacific Island countries; response to the climate crisis;
and acquisition of vessels, helicopters, transport aircraft and
others to strengthen the maritime surveillance capability.

**6** **Southeast Asia**


**❶ [General Situation ]**

Southeast Asia occupies a strategic position for traffi c,

linking the Pacifi c and the Indian Oceans, such as the Straits

of Malacca and the South China Sea. It is an important region

for Japan, which relies on maritime transport for many of the

supplies needed for economic activities and the lives of the

Japanese people. Such economic development has deepened

interdependence within the region and with countries outside

the region. In late 2015, the establishment of the ASEAN

Community was declared as an outcome of the strides made

in ASEAN cooperation towards its integration.

Meanwhile, this region still has destabilizing factors,

including the territorial disputes over the South China

Sea, ethnic minority issues, separatist and independence


movements, and Islamic extremist groups. Moreover, there

are incidents, such as piracy, by which the safe passage of

ships is obstructed. In order to cope with these issues, the

countries in Southeast Asia are working to build military

forces for national defense and maintenance of domestic

public security, as well as for addressing new security

issues such as terrorism and piracy. They are also pursuing

cooperation with such countries as the United States, China,

Russia, Australia, and India to this end. Recently, against

the backdrop of economic development, the countries have

been modernizing their military forces, mainly their naval

and air forces, as well as strengthening their maritime law

enforcement capacities.

expansion and enhancement of defense cooperation with

other countries as a highly credible partner.

On the other hand, in connection with the recent continued

anchoring of Chinese government vessels around South

Luconia Shoal, over which Malaysia claims sovereignty,

Malaysia has announced that its Navy and maritime law

enforcement agencies would conduct around-the-clock

monitoring, and that Malaysia would defend its sovereignty.

Along with this strengthening of its maritime defense force,

Malaysia also has striven to bolster its defense posture in

eastern Malaysia, constructing a new naval base in April 2017

in Bintulu, close to James Shoal and South Luconia Shoal. In

July 2019, the Air Force carried out live-fire missile exercises

in Sabah state, on Borneo in eastern Malaysia. In December

2019, Malaysia made a submission to the Commission on the

Limits of the Continental Shelf, aimed at setting the limits of

its continental shelf beyond 200 nautical miles.

Malaysia and the United States hold joint exercises such

as CARAT and SEACAT, and promote military cooperation

including capacity-building in the maritime security field.

**Chapter**


Malaysia’s first defense white paper, which was published

in December 2019, highlights the country’s geography as a

nation with two territories—Peninsular Malaysia, and Sabah

and Sarawak, on the island of Borneo—located between the

vast Pacific and Indian Oceans. The document identifies

Malaysia’s potential to serve as a bridging linchpin between

the two oceans, and also demonstrates an awareness of the

fact that, while Malaysia’s strategic location and natural

resources are a blessing, they also pose a challenge. Given

these attributes, Malaysia has historically been affected

by the political dynamics of major powers. Even today,

Malaysia sees in its defense white paper that uncertain big

power relations, which refers to the U.S.-China, is the most

important strategic factor for Malaysia. Moreover, the white

paper also demonstrates an awareness that Malaysia faces

increasing non-traditional security threats such as terrorism,

cyberthreats, piracy, and natural disasters.

Based on this recognition, Malaysia’s defense policy

aims to defend national interests in each of three concentric

areas of interest, consisting of the Core Area, which includes

both the country’s land masses and its territorial waters; the

Extended Area, which encompasses the surrounding waters

and airspace; and the Forward Area, which incorporates

locations beyond the extended area where Malaysia’s national

interests are affected. The policy consists of three key pillars:

(1) “Concentric Deterrence,” which aims to deter all forms

of external intrusion or conflicts by enhancing the capability

of the nation’s armed forces; (2) “Comprehensive Defense,”

which seeks to build resilience as a nation throughout society,

including among the people; and (3) “Credible Partnerships,”


Myanmar shares borders with China and India and is a

the West, transition to civilian rule based on the road map to

democracy was completed.[3]

Including the release of political prisoners and ceasefire

agreements with ethnic minorities, the Government of

Myanmar has actively taken steps toward democratization.

The international community has shown some level of

appreciation for these steps, with the West, including the

United States, easing economic sanctions on Myanmar.

However, following an August 2017 attack on a police

station by Arakan Rohingya Salvation Army (ARSA), forces

including Myanmar’s military launched mop-up operations

in Rakhine state and more than 600,000 refugees—primarily

Muslims—fleeing to the neighboring country, Bangladesh,

in two months. The international community denounced

Myanmar for the purported massacre and human rights

violation. Myanmar faced criticism from Western countries

over the situation, with the United States announcing in

August 2019 that it would tighten sanctions against the

commanding officers of Myanmar’s military forces. In

addition, the Gambia brought a case against Myanmar at

the International Court of Justice (ICJ) for breaching the

Genocide Convention, with the aim of preventing all acts

under Article 2 of the Convention. In January 2020, the ICJ

issued provisional measures which indicated that Myanmar

should use all means to prevent oppression.[4]

In terms of foreign policy, Myanmar continues to uphold

a policy of neutrality and non-alignment, while for its

national defense policy, continues to emphasize the three

national causes of Non-disintegration of the Union, Non
disintegration of National Solidarity, and Perpetuation of

Sovereignty, as well as resolutely repelling foreign invasions

and interference in domestic matters.

China has maintained a good relationship with Myanmar

since the two countries established diplomatic relations

in 1950 and is regarded as a major supplier of equipment.

Myanmar has also received Chinese aid for pipeline

construction and the development of Kyaukpyu Port. In

January 2020, President Xi Jinping became the first Chinese

leader to visit Myanmar for 19 years and affirmed China’s

policy of promoting economic cooperation through the BRI.

Myanmar has maintained a cooperative relationship with

Russia in the military field, including during the military

regime, and Russia has been a destination for students from

Myanmar and a supplier of major defense equipment. As

for India, since the transition to civilian rule, Myanmar has


deepened cooperative relations in the fields of the economy

and military, which has developed into defense cooperation

and exchanges such as the hosting of various seminars and

friendly visits to Myanmar by Indian naval vessels.

Cooperative relations with North Korea, including

weapons trades, were maintained under Myanmar’s military

regime. Following the transition to democracy, although

Myanmar denies that it has military ties to North Korea, the

report issued by the Panel of Experts of the UN Security

Council Sanctions Committee on North Korea in March

2018 reported that the country has received a ballistic missile

system and other weapons from North Korea.

**4** The Philippines


**Chapter**


The Philippines considers that its archipelagic attributes

and geographic location are a source of both strength and

vulnerability. Moreover, the country sees that its strategic

location and rich natural resources have also provided a

strong temptation to expansionist powers. Based on this

perception, although resolving internal armed conflicts

remains its top security concern, rising tensions in the South

China Sea have prompted the Philippines to give the same

attention to territorial defense as it does to internal security

threats.

The Philippines, with a historically close relationship with

the United States, has maintained a cooperative relationship

with the United States under their mutual defense treaty and

military assistance agreement, even after the withdrawal of

the U.S. Forces in 1992. The two countries conduct a number

of bilateral exercises, including Balikatan, KAMANDAG,

and Maritime Training Activity Sama Sama. In March

2016, the two countries agreed on five locations for carrying

out defense cooperation under the Enhanced Defense

Cooperation Agreement (EDCA) they signed in April 2014

for strengthening cooperation in such areas as the capacity

enhancement of the Armed Forces of the Philippines and

disaster relief: Antonio Bautista Air Base, Basa Air Base, Fort

Magsaysay, Lumbia Air Base, and Mactan-Benito Ebuen Air

Base. During his visit to the Philippines in March 2019, U.S.

Secretary of State Mike Pompeo made it clear that the South

China Sea is part of the Pacific Ocean and thus any armed

attack on Philippine forces, aircraft, or public vessels in the

South China Sea would trigger mutual defense obligations

under the Mutual Defense Treaty. In September 2019, the

United States and the Philippines held the Mutual Defense

Board and Security Engagement Board (MDB-SEB), at

which they reaffi rmed the importance of their defense

cooperation. However, President Rodrigo Duterte hinted

in January 2020 that he intended to terminate the Visiting

Forces Agreement (VFA), which prescribed the legal status

of U.S. military personnel when U.S. Forces undertook joint

military exercises or other activities in the Philippines, and

notifi ed the United States of its termination in February.

Attention will be paid to further action by the two countries

moving forward.

The Philippines and China have competing claims over

the sovereignty of the Spratly Islands and Scarborough

Shoal in the South China Sea. Seeking a settlement under

international law, in January 2013, the Philippines launched

arbitral tribunal proceedings pursuant to UNCLOS against

China. In July 2016, a fi nal award was rendered, accepting

nearly all of the Philippines’ submissions. The Government

of the Philippines released a statement that it welcomed

the award by the arbitral tribunal and strongly affi rms its

respect for the decision. Also, President Duterte stated in

his State of the Nation Address held in the same month that

the Philippines would strongly affi rm and uphold the award

handed down for the arbitration case between the Philippines

and China. In September 2019, the Offi ce of the President of

the Philippines revealed that China had vowed to adopt a 60
40 sharing scheme favoring the Philippines in the proposed

joint development of resources in the South China Sea


in exchange for setting aside the arbitral court ruling. The

Offi ce of the President of the Philippines, however, made it

clear that it would not abandon the ruling.

In April 2019, the Philippines criticized China when it

confi rmed the presence of more than 200 Chinese vessels near

and around Thitu Island (Filipino name: Pag-asa Island), which

is occupied by the Philippines. In June, in response to a claim

that the Chinese aircraft carrier “Liaoning” and other ships

had passed through the Sibutu Strait, Secretary of National

Defense Lorenzana said that it was not innocent passage.

The submission of an amnesty bill intended to pave the

way for the pardon and return of former Prime Minister

Thaksin Shinawatra by ruling parties to the National

Assembly in 2013 exacerbated domestic disorder. In May

2014, then Commander-in-Chief Prayut Chan-o-Cha of

the Royal Thai Army issued a declaration of martial law

nationwide, and then seized power via the National Council

for Peace and Order, which mostly comprises the Thai

military. Subsequently, under the interim administration

led by Prayut, who was selected as interim Prime Minister,

the government worked towards a transition to a new

administration based on the road map to civilian rule. The

new constitution was promulgated and entered into force in

April 2017. In March 2019, a general election was held for

the fi rst time in approximately 8 years. In June 2019, King

Maha Vajiralongkorn approved the appointment of Prayut as

prime minister and the following month granted approval for

the new cabinet. Prime Minister Prayut concurrently serves

as defense minister.

the coup d'état in 2014, the U.S. suspended some military aid.

After the coup, the United States scaled down the size of

U.S. forces participating in the Cobra Gold. However, this

was restored under the Trump Administration. In addition,

the two countries have continued their bilateral naval

training CARAT and counter-piracy and traffi cking exercise

SEACAT.

Thailand and China have conducted joint exercises such

as Blue Strike among their marines and Falcon Strike among

their air forces. It has been pointed out that Thailand’s

military relationship with China has become closer after the

freezing of U.S. military assistance following the coup.

In September 2019, Thailand and the ROK signed

the General Security of Military Information Agreement

(GSOMIA).

defense cooperation agreements with countries within and

outside the region. With the aim of contributing to peace and

stability in the region, Singapore supports U.S. presence in

the Asia-Pacifi c and permits it to use military facilities in

Singapore. Since 2013, U.S. littoral combat ships (LCSs)

began their rotational deployments. In December 2015,

the P-8 patrol aircraft of the U.S. Forces were deployed to

Singapore for around one week for the fi rst time. The two

countries have committed to continuing to carry out similar

deployments routinely. In addition, Singapore conducts

joint exercises with the United States, such as CARAT and

SEACAT. In September 2019, the two countries signed

the Protocol of Amendment to the 1990 Memorandum of

Understanding Regarding United States Use of Facilities in

Singapore.

Singapore has strong economic ties with China. Both

countries also conduct joint naval exercises. In October

2019, the two countries signed the enhanced Agreement on

Defence Exchanges and Security Cooperation (ADESC).

On the other hand, diplomatic relations with China have

been strained partly due to Singapore’s belief in following

the arbitration award when it comes to the resolution of

the South China Sea disputes and partly due to Singapore’s

defense relationship with Taiwan.

Singapore concluded the Bilateral Agreement for Navy

Cooperation with India in November 2017 and the two

countries undertake Exercise Bold Kurukshetra, a bilateral

armor exercise, and the Singapore India Maritime Bilateral

Exercise (SIMBEX). In addition, Singapore, India, and

Thailand held their fi rst trilateral joint exercise in September

2019, which took place near the Andaman Islands.

**7** Vietnam

Vietnam recognizes that, while the Asia-Pacific region
continues to be a center for dynamic economic development
and occupies an increasingly important geo-economic, geopolitical, and strategic location, the region still remains the
ground for major powers’ rivalry and influence intensification,
harboring destabilizing elements. Based on its viewpoint that
the sea is closely associated with the national construction
and defense, Vietnam has established the objective of
becoming a strong marine country, particularly prioritizing
the modernization of its military forces and law enforcement
forces at sea as well as ensuring the capability to properly
handle sea situations, maritime independence, sovereignty,
sovereign rights, jurisdiction and national interests at sea.

Vietnam and the United States have strengthened their

military relations in recent years. This has taken such forms

as joint exercises with the U.S. Navy and port calls by

U.S. Navy vessels in Vietnam. In 2017, mutual visits were

conducted by the leaders of both countries, and an agreement

was reached on the deepening of defense cooperation. March

2018 marked the first port call by a U.S. aircraft carrier to

Vietnam since the end of the Vietnam war. In addition, the

U.S. aircraft carrier and cruiser made a call at Da Nang in

March 2020.

Vietnam and Russia continue to strengthen cooperation

in the area of national defense, with Vietnam dependent on

Russia for the majority of its defense equipment. In April

2018, the two countries signed a military and technical

cooperation roadmap, while in July 2019, a Vietnamese

naval vessel visited the port of Vladivostok for the first time.

In December 2019, a submarine rescue vessel from Russia’s

Pacific Fleet visited the port of Cam Ranh and participated in

the first bilateral joint submarine rescue exercise.

See Section 4-6-5 (2) of this Chapter (Relations with Asian Countries)


Vietnam and China, under their comprehensive strategic

cooperation partnership relations, proactively conduct

exchanges among their senior government officials. However,

the two countries have competing claims concerning issues

such as sovereignty over the South China Sea. In summits

and many other occasions, the two countries have agreed to

process the differences in their opinions on maritime issues

and to refrain from activities that would complicate the

matters. However, they have disputes regarding resources

development and the operation of fishing boats. The defense

white paper published in November 2019 demonstrates an

awareness that Vietnam and China need to be settled with

precaution, avoiding negative impacts on general peace,

friendship, and cooperation for development between the two

countries. As such, it recognizes that the two countries should

continue negotiations and consultations to find peaceful

solutions on the basis of international law. Between July and

October 2019, a standoff took place between Vietnamese and

Chinese government ships over an oil development project

that had been taking place off the coast of Vietnam since

May.

Vietnam and India have been deepening their cooperative

relationship in a broad range of areas, including security and

economy. In the area of defense cooperation, it is noted that

the Indian Armed Forces support the training of Vietnam’s

Navy submarine personnel and Air Force pilots, and Indian

Navy vessels make friendly visits to Vietnam. In September

2016, Prime Minister Modi became the first Indian prime

minister to visit Vietnam in 15 years. During the visit an

agreement was reached on raising the status of the bilateral

relationship to a comprehensive strategic partnership, while

an announcement was made concerning a loan of US$500

million for deepening defense cooperation.

Malaysia announced a plan to build six indigenous

LCSs. The first of these vessels was launched in August

2017. Furthermore, in November 2016, Malaysia concluded

an agreement with China to purchase four littoral mission

ships (LMSs). In June 2019, Malaysia announced that it was

to receive 12 ScanEagle UAVs from the United States by

March 2022.

Myanmar’s December 2019 procurement of its first

submarine—a Kilo-class submarine received from India—is

attracting attention from neighboring countries.

The Philippines has taken steps in recent years to

modernize its defense equipment against the backdrop of

conflicts over territorial rights in the South China Sea.

In terms of air force capabilities, between November

2015 and May 2017, the Philippines successively introduced

12 FA-50PH light fighters purchased from the ROK. It is

currently planning to initiate a multi-role fighter program.

In addition, the Philippines plans to receive eight ScanEagle

UAVs from the United States by March 2022.

As for naval forces, the Philippines received three

Hamilton-class frigates from the United States by 2016.

The Philippines introduced two Indonesian-made landing

dock vessels by 2017. In October 2016, the Philippines

concluded an agreement to purchase two frigates from the

ROK. The August 2019 commissioning of a Pohang-class

corvette received from the ROK marked the restoration of

the antisubmarine capability that the Philippines had long

lacked. That September, the Philippines conducted the

DAGIT-PA multi-service military exercise involving the

Army, Navy, and Air Force, during which the four AAV-7

Singapore is actively striving to modernize its forces.

Today, it is one of the largest arms importers in the world.

It introduced 24 U.S.-made F-15 fighters by 2012 and

also participates in the F-35 JSF Program. In January

2020, the U.S. Government officially approved the sale of

F-35B fighter jets to Singapore and delivered the required

certification notifying Congress of the sale.

As for Thailand, in July 2014, the country established the

Submarine Squadron Headquarters. In April 2017, the Royal

Thai Navy drew up a plan to purchase three Yuan-class

submarines from China over the next 11 years, and the Thai

Cabinet approved the purchase of one vessel. In addition,

the Cabinet approved in September 2012 a plan to introduce

two frigates. The first frigate was received from the ROK

in December 2018. In September 2019, Thailand signed an

agreement to purchase a Type 071 landing platform dock

from China. In addition, by 2013, Thailand had introduced

12 Swedish-made JAS-39 Gripen fighters. In September

2019, it received the first 10 of 60 Stryker armored vehicles

purchased from the United States.

By January 2017, Vietnam successively introduced six

Russian-made Kilo-class submarines. By February 2018,

Vietnam started the operation of four Russian-made Gepard
class frigates. As for its air force capabilities, Vietnam

started to successively introduce Russian-made Su-30

fighters in 2004, and to date, the total number of delivered

Su-30 fighters came to 36. In January 2020, it was reported

that Vietnam had ordered 12 Yak-130 training aircraft from

Russia. It is also due to receive six ScanEagle UAVs from the

United States by March 2022.

**1** General Situation


**2** Military Affairs

As a part of the efforts to modernize its naval and air forces,
India is expanding procurement of equipment from foreign
countries as well as joint development with them, and has
emerged as the world’s second-largest arms importer.[1]
Furthermore, under the “Make in India” initiative, the
administration is promoting expansion of foreign companies’
direct investment in India’s defense industry and the domestic
production of equipment through enhancing technological
cooperation with other countries.
With respect to its naval capabilities, India operates
the Russian-built conventional powered aircraft carrier
INS “Vikramaditya,” and is also building one indigenous
conventional powered aircraft carrier INS “Vikrant” with
aid from France and Italy. With regard to submarines, India
acquired one Russian-built Akula-class nuclear-powered
attack submarine INS “Chakra” in April 2012 under a lease
arrangement and the two countries signed a deal in March
2019 for the lease of another Akula-class nuclear-powered
attack submarine. It also reportedly placed into service its
fi rst indigenous ballistic missile and nuclear submarine
INS “Arihant,” which was built with support from Russia,
in August 2016. In January 2020, India test-fi red a K-4
submarine-launched ballistic missile from an underwater
platform. Furthermore, India is making progress with the
indigenous production of six conventional submarines in
collaboration with France, commissioning the fi rst of six
license-built submarines, INS “Kalvari,” in December 2017,
and the second, INS “Khanderi,” in September 2019. In
January 2019, India decided to move forward with a project
to produce another six conventional submarines locally in
partnership with a foreign company. It has deployed the
eight P-8I patrol aircraft purchased from the United States
to a base in southern India and, in July 2016, concluded a
purchase agreement for an additional four P-8Is.
With respect to its air force capabilities, India signed
an agreement to purchase 36 Rafale fi ghter aircraft from
France in September 2016 as part of India’s plan to introduce
medium multi-role combat aircraft (MMRCA). Handover of
the fi ghters began in October 2019.

With a population of more than 1.3 billion on its vast
land, India is the world’s largest democratic country. It
has achieved steady economic growth in recent years, and
has signifi cant infl uence in the South Asian region. Also,
it is located in the middle of the Indian Ocean, which is of
strategic and geopolitical importance in terms of sea lines of
communication, connecting the Asia-Pacifi c region with the
Middle East and Europe. With the permeation of the concept
of “Indo-Pacifi c” in the international community, India has
increased its presence as a geopolitical player, while the
international community in return has increasingly high
expectations for the country’s role.
On the diplomatic front, the second Modi administration
that was inaugurated in May 2019 has maintained the
neighborhood fi rst policy, which emphasizes strengthening
relations with South Asian countries, while expanding the
focus of strengthening India’s external relations to the AsiaPacifi c region, in accordance with the “Act East” policy. In
addition, the administration has carried out proactive foreign
policy, placing priority also on India’s relations with the United
States, Russia, Europe, among other areas. In the defense
domain, too, the administration has attached importance to
ensuring maritime security, especially in the Indian Ocean,
and deepened collaboration with other countries. As well as
attaching importance to the Indian Ocean, on which India
depends for its trade, the Indian Maritime Security Strategy
published in October 2015 defi nes the nation’s primary areas
of maritime interest as an extensive marine area centered
on India, encompassing the Persian Gulf, the Red Sea, and
the Strait of Malacca. In addition, the strategy states that
India will become a “net security provider” in the maritime
neighborhood.
India has non-demarcated border issues with China and
Pakistan. India has multiple ethnic groups, religions, cultures,
and languages, and there are concerns about the activities of
ultra-leftists and secession and independence movements, as
well as the movements of Islamic extremists stationed across
the India-Pakistan border.

**Chapter**


Based on the nuclear doctrine of 2003, India adheres
to the following policies: credible minimum deterrence,
the no-first-use nuclear policy, no use against non-nuclear
weapon nations, and maintaining the unilateral moratorium
on nuclear tests that it announced immediately after the
nuclear test in 1998. India promotes the development
and deployment of various ballistic missiles. As well as
conducting the test launches of “Agni 5” in December 2018
and “Agni 2” in November 2019, India has reportedly started
developing “Agni 6,” which is believed to have a range of up
to 10,000 km. It is deemed that the country aspires to extend
the ranges of ballistic missiles and make other performance
improvements. In regard to cruise missiles, India has
deployed the supersonic cruise missile “BrahMos” jointly
developed with Russia and is also developing the hypersonic
cruise missile “BrahMos II” and a ballistic missile defense
system.[2]

（1）Relations with the United States

India is actively striving to strengthen bilateral relations
with the United States. In line with the expansion of the
relationship derived from the economic growth of India,
the United States is also promoting engagement with India.
It sees India as a partner that shares universal values and
strategic interests with the United States in the region. The
two countries conduct the exercises, such as Malabar[3] with

（4）Relations with South Asian and Southeast Asia Countries

In the “Transformational Diplomacy” published in June
2015, India clearly set out the neighborhood first policy,
aimed at strengthening relations with other South Asian
countries. Based on this policy, India agreed in November
2019 to provide Sri Lanka with US$4.5 billion in aid to
fund anti-terrorism measures, and agreed in December 2018
to provide the Maldives with US$4.7 billion in support for
economic development. In the case of Bangladesh, India
agreed in April 2017 to provide US$4.5 billion to support
economic development and also concluded a memorandum
of understanding on defense cooperation, which included
US$500 million in defense-related aid.


Reports specify these missiles as follows. Agni 5: a mobile, three-stage solid-fueled ballistic missile with a range of about 5,000-8,000 km. Agni 6: a three-stage solid/liquid-fuelled ballistic
missile with a range of about 8,000-10,000 km. BrahMos: a solid/Ramjet supersonic cruise missile with a range of about 300-500 km. Also, India is reportedly developing a ballistic missile
defense system. According to reports, it is a two-stage intercept system consisting of a missile for high altitude interception (PAD) up to 80 km in altitude and a missile for low altitude
interception (AAD) up to 30 km in altitude.

The Malabar was initially a bilateral maritime exercise between the United States and India. Japan has participated in the Malabar since 2007, and Malabar 17, Malabar 18 and Malabar 19
were conducted as trilateral exercises among Japan, the United States and India.

it conducted another test fire of the submarine launched
cruise missile “Babur” in March 2018. Pakistan is thought
to be steadily increasing the capabilities of its missiles,
firing the “Shaheen 1” ballistic missile in November 2019,
following India’s launch of a ballistic missile.[5]

Pakistan is the world’s 11th-largest importer of weapons,
and it is pointed out that approximately 60% of its weapons
are imported from China.[6] Pakistan jointly developed the AlKhalid tank and the JF-17 fighter aircraft with China. It is
currently using the 85 indigenously produced JF-17 Block I
and Block II aircraft, and has begun manufacture of the JF17 Block III. Pakistan is reportedly also planning to purchase
from China eight submarines, which Pakistan is positioning
as the “backbone of the Navy.” Four will be built in China,
with the remainder to be built in Pakistan.

（1）Relations with the United States

Besides supporting the activities of the U.S. Forces in
Afghanistan, Pakistan cooperates with the war on terror by
launching mop-up operations against Islamic extremists in
the Pakistan-Afghanistan border area.
Meanwhile, Pakistan urges the United States to
immediately end its drone attacks on Islamic extremists
in Pakistani territory, and the Pakistan Government has
protested repeatedly.
The United States, on the other hand, has condemned
Pakistan for allowing Islamic extremists in Afghanistan
to take haven, which poses a threat to the United States.
In August 2017, “No partnership can survive a country’s
harboring of militants and terrorists who target U.S. Service
members,” President Trump said. The same month, the
United States announced the suspension of $205 million in


**1** General Situation


Wedged between the powerful South Asian nation of India
and politically-unstable Afghanistan, and sharing borders
with China and Iran, Pakistan is placed in a geopolitically
significant and complex position. In particular, Islamic
extremists conduct activities across the Pakistan-Afghanistan
border, and Pakistan’s attitude towards the war against
terrorism draws much attention from the international
community.
While supporting the United States’ war against terrorism in
Afghanistan, the Government of Pakistan has been struggling
as its domestic security situation has worsened, with issues
such as growing anti-U.S. sentiment and retaliatory terrorism
by Islamic extremists. Although the Pakistan Armed Forces’
reinforced operation to crackdown on militant groups has
reportedly drastically decreased terrorism, terrorist attacks
have continued to occur sporadically.
Against such backdrop, the Pakistani government has
continued its counter-terrorism operation, “Radd-ul-Fasaad,”
since 2017, while also working on the construction of fences
and guarding stations along the border with Afghanistan to
prevent the entrance of extremist groups.

**2** Military Affairs


**Chapter**


Pakistan takes the position that maintaining nuclear
deterrence against the nuclear threat posed by India is
essential to ensure national security and self-defense. It is
believed to have begun nuclear development in the 1970s
and conducted its first nuclear test in 1998.
Pakistan has been actively proceeding with the
development of ballistic missiles and cruise missiles capable
of carrying nuclear warheads, and has conducted a number of
test launches in recent years. In 2015, Pakistan conducted two
test launches of the ballistic missile “Shaheen 3” in March
and December, and a test launch from an aircraft of the cruise
missile “Raad” in January 2016. Pakistan also conducted its

process goes forward.” With the desire for an improvement
in relations evident in such developments, the response by
both countries will be the focus of attention.

**❶ [General Situation]**

With the end of the Cold War, many European countries now

recognize the need to address diverse security challenges,

such as outbreaks of regional confl icts within and around

Europe, the rise of terrorism, the proliferation of WMDs, and

the growing seriousness of cyber threats. At the same time,

these countries had recognized that the threat of large-scale

invasion by other countries had disappeared. Nevertheless,

since the heightening of tensions in Ukraine in February

2014, there is a growing need to revisit existing strategies

and plan new concepts in order to deal with Russia’s changes

to the status quo with force in the background and “hybrid

warfare.” With regard to international terrorism, the incidents

of terrorism occurring within European nations have made

counterterrorism efforts an urgent task. In addition, border


security problems remain a challenge, including those

regarding refugees and migrants that have rapidly increased

due to Middle East turmoil such as the prolonged civil war

in Syria.


To respond to such challenges and situations, Europe has

sought to further strengthen and expand multilateral frameworks,

such as NATO and the EU. At the same time, it is working

to contribute to the security and stability of the international

community by proactively participating in activities outside

the European region. Moreover, steps are taken at the national

Plan (RAP) for enhancing existing readiness forces.[1] Based

on this plan, NATO has continued to maintain its presence

in eastern allies, while steps have been taken to significantly

improve the readiness of the existing multinational NATO

Response Force (NRF) and create the Very High Readiness

Joint Task Force (VJTF) that can be mobilized within two to

three days. Furthermore, at the NATO Summit in July 2016,

members decided to deploy four multinational battle groups

to the three Baltic nations and Poland on a rotational basis.

These became fully operational in 2017. At the NATO Summit

in July 2018, members decided to put in place a readiness

initiative called the “Four Thirties,” to maintain a situation in

which, by 2020, 30 mechanized battalions, 30 air squadrons,

and 30 combat vessels can be ready to be used within 30

days or less. They also decided on reforms of the command

headquarters, establishing the Joint Force Command Norfolk

in the United States with the objective of strengthening the

defense of Atlantic sea lines of communications between

the United States and Europe, as well as establishing the

Joint Support and Enabling Command in Ulm, Germany,

to expedite the transport of troops and equipment within

and outside Europe. Views on Russia differ between NATO

member states against the backdrop of their different

geographical distances from Russia and others. While taking

measures to address Russian influence, NATO members

have maintained opportunities for dialogue with Russia to

narrow their differences in views and increase predictability.

Alongside collective defense, NATO’s core tasks include

a more efficient and flexible alliance. The document cites

major threats such as proliferation of WMDs and ballistic

missiles, terrorism, conflict or instability beyond NATO

borders, and cyber attacks, and prescribes three core tasks

as follows: (1) collective defense in accordance with

Article 5 of the Washington Treaty; (2) crisis management

including conflict prevention and post-conflict stabilization

and reconstruction assistance; and (3) cooperative security

including active contribution to arms control, disarmament,

and non-proliferation.


Defense spending has been trending downwards in recent

years, but in light of changes in the security environment,

and the expanding gap of defense expenditure between the

United States and other member states, NATO member states

in 2014 agreed on the goal to allocate 2% or more of their

GDP to defense spending by 2024. The London Declaration

was adopted at NATO’s 70th anniversary summit in

December 2019. The participating leaders reaffirmed therein

their solemn commitment to collective defense as enshrined

in Article 5 of the Washington Treaty and stated that they will

increase defense expenditure further. Acknowledging that

NATO faces not only the challenges of Russia and terrorism,

but also cyber and hybrid threats, they also affirmed that

NATO will address Russia’s deployment of intermediate
range missiles and declared space an operational domain.

China’s rise to prominence was discussed for the first time

and the Declaration explicitly states that China’s growing

for 25 countries among the member countries. Under

this framework, the participating countries finance and

early warning and control aircraft forces to fight against ISIL.

Under the decision, NATO surveillance and reconnaissance

In response to the crisis in Ukraine, the EU has condemned


the military measures of Russia and implemented economic

sanctions against Russia. In addition, to support the economic

and political reforms in Ukraine, the EU continues its

engagement in nonmilitary affairs, including the provision of

large-scale financial assistance to Ukraine.


To deal with the threat of ISIL, the EU extends funds

to carry out humanitarian assistance for Syria and Iraq.

Additionally, the EU works with countries in regions such

as the Middle East and North Africa to provide capacity

to combat piracy, has been under way off the coast of Somalia

and in the Gulf of Aden since December 2008. Under this

mission, vessels and aircraft dispatched from each country

protect ships in the area and conduct surveillance in these

waters. In addition, those vessels and aircraft conduct joint

exercises with SDF units. In May 2015, the EU started

The EU, although it has a property of non-binding multilateral cooperation, introduced the CFSP, which covers all areas of foreign and security policy based on the Treaty of Maastricht,
which took effect in 1993. In June 1999, the European Council decided to implement the European Security and Defence Policy (ESDP) to offer peacekeeping and humanitarian assistance

**3 Cooperation between NATO and the EU**

Advancements have been seen in cooperation between NATO

and the EU in addressing unprecedented challenges efficiently.

At the NATO Summit in July 2016, a joint declaration was

released citing hybrid threats, cybersecurity and other fields

in which NATO and the EU should prioritize cooperation.

The NATO Summit in July 2018 issued a joint declaration

that identified substantial progress in NATO-EU cooperation

and cited the mobility of military forces, counterterrorism

and other fields for further cooperation. Based on these

declarations, NATO’s Operation Sea Guardian and the

EU’s Operation Sophia are now mutually collaborating

through information support in the Mediterranean. The EU’s

PESCO includes a project for developing arrangements for

smooth movement of military personnel and assets inside

Against this backdrop, in November 2015, the Cameron

**2 France**

Since the end of the Cold War, France has focused on

maintaining independence of its defense policies, while

having led initiatives to enhance the defense structure and

capability in Europe. It has worked on the development of

its military capacity by streamlining and integrating military

bases, dealing with operational requirements to strengthen

its defense capability, as well as enhancing its intelligence

capabilities and modernizing equipment required in the


Since September 2014, the United Kingdom has

conducted airstrikes against ISIL in Iraq. In addition, it

carries out ISR activities using UAVs, provides education

and training to forces engaged in ground warfare such as the

Iraqi Security Forces and Peshmerga, a military organization

of the Kurdistan Regional Government, as well as extends

humanitarian assistance to refugees. Furthermore, following

the terror attacks in Paris, the United Kingdom decided in

December 2015 to extend the scope of the airstrikes from

Iraq to Syria, and commenced airstrikes in Syria on the day

terrorism, the refugee issue, and the Ukraine crisis, are

diversifying, increasing in complexity, and rapidly becoming

more violent, and amidst the increasingly multipolar

international system, competition is intensifying among

major military powers and the danger of escalation is growing.

Under these conditions, France will fulfill its duties within

NATO, including for collective defense and contributing to

security, and will take a leading role in efforts to strengthen

the EU’s defense capabilities. In June 2018, the Military

Planning Law for 2019-2025 was enacted, consisting of

four pillars—human resources, equipment modernization,

contributions to Europe’s strategic independence, and

attaching importance to working with security partners in the

region. In particular, the United Kingdom considers Japan as

its closest security partner in Asia, conducting exercises with

Japan. It has also participated in the multilateral exercise

RIMPAC and deployed naval ships in the region, enhancing

its engagement in regional security. In February 2019, Gavin

Williamson, then Secretary of State for Defence of the United

Kingdom, announced that the aircraft carrier HMS “Queen

Elizabeth” was to be sent to the Mediterranean, Middle East,

and Pacific. Recently, to assist in international efforts to

France’s GDP by 2025.


Furthermore, France dispatched Falcon 200 reconnaissance

aircraft to conduct warning and surveillance operations

against illegal maritime activities, including illicit ship-to
ship transfers involving North Korea-flagged ships. In 2019,

the frigate “Vendémiaire” conducted patrol and monitoring

activities in the seas around Japan, including the East China

Sea. From the viewpoint of enhancing the effectiveness of the

UN Security Council resolutions, Japan and France engaged

in cooperation activities, including information sharing.


Having positioned the fight against ISIL as one of its

top national defense priorities, France has been conducting

airstrikes against ISIL in Iraq since September 2014 and in

Syria since September 2015. The aircraft carrier “Charles de

Gaulle” supported anti-ISIL operations while at sea in the

eastern Mediterranean in April 2019 and was among the

naval task force dispatched to the eastern Mediterranean

for a month in January 2020 to provide similar operational

support. In addition, France has continued to provide

education and training to the Iraqi Security Forces and

Peshmerga, as well as humanitarian assistance for refugees.

In January 2020, France and seven other European nations,

including the Netherlands and Denmark, issued a political

statement supporting the creation of the European Maritime

**Chapter**


While Germany has been implementing a large-scale

reduction of its military personnel since the end of the

Cold War, it has been gradually expanding the dispatch of

its federal forces overseas. At the same time, Germany has

advanced the reform of its armed forces to enable them to

execute multiple responsibilities encompassing conflict

prevention and risk management in the context of multilateral

organizations, including NATO, the EU, and the UN.

However, following a worsening in the security environment,

in May 2016 Germany changed policy and announced that it

would increase military personnel by around 7,000 by 2023.

Since France has territories in the Indo-Pacific region,


it places importance on its commitment to the region.

The Strategic Review points out the potential for a threat

to interests, such as the freedom of navigation, due to the

worsening strategic situation in the Asia-Pacific region,

and clearly states that France will maintain its stance of

protecting the sovereignty of its overseas territories in the

Pacific Ocean and the Indian Ocean. France’s Defence

Strategy in the Indo-Pacific, which was published in June

2019, states that China’s growing influence is shifting the

balances of power in the Indo-Pacific region and highlights

the importance of strengthening partnerships with the United

States, Australia, India, and Japan. In addition, France has

proactively organized the multilateral exercises Croix du Sud

and Equateur in the South Pacific. In February 2018, France

had the frigate “Vendémiaire” make a port call in Japan and

conduct joint exercises with the Maritime Self-Defense Force

(MSDF). In March 2019, a carrier strike group including

the aircraft carrier “Charles de Gaulle” left France, and

security environment has grown more complex and unstable,

causing gradually rising uncertainty, citing specific threats

such as international terrorism, cyber attacks, interstate

conflict, and the influx of refugees and immigrants. The

white paper also states that Germany would continue to

emphasize multilateral cooperation and cross-government

approaches, while striving to realize rules-based international

order. Furthermore, with regard to the number of military

personnel, the white paper notes that although an upper limit

was in place following the end of the Cold War and Germany

has continually worked to reduce personnel, it would shift

to a policy with no upper limit and perform regular reviews

of its military force plan to adjust the number of personnel

flexibly.


In Iraq, Germany has provided support for capacity

building, including providing education and training to

the Iraqi Security Forces since 2015. In December 2015

that the region plays a central role in international politics.

However, Germany has allocated most of its military assets

for NATO and EU missions outside the Asia-Pacific region

and limited its military engagement in the region to disaster

relief missions and goodwill visits, failing to participate in

joint exercises involving naval ships in the region. Given

that Germany is attempting to enhance its naval power by

launching four new frigates by 2020, the German Navy’s

future engagement in the region will attract attention.

**❶[ Overview]**

The Middle East and Africa has long been one of the world’s

centers of civilization, religion, and trade, as well as a

geopolitical bastion connecting Asia and Europe. Today, the

Middle East is a major source of energy supply for the world

and contains major routes for international commerce. Japan

is also dependent on the region for approximately 90% of

its crude oil imports. Peace and stability in the Middle East

region is extremely important for the peace and prosperity of

the international community, including Japan.

**❷[ Situation in the Gulf Region ]**


On the other hand, the Middle East and Africa region has

been experiencing constant confl icts and unrest throughout

the 20th century. In recent years, tensions have risen due to

the situation in the Gulf region and the Middle East peace

process. In addition, the Arab Spring that occurred at the

beginning of 2011 prompted regime change in some countries,

but due to the turmoil that followed, almost a decade later,

civil wars and the activities of terrorist organizations are

the JCPOA. Accordingly, the United States suspended its

nuclear-related sanctions against Iran. In addition, the EU

terminated some of its sanctions, and the provisions imposed

by previous UN Security Council resolutions concerning the

nuclear issues of Iran ended, in accordance with UN Security

Council Resolution 2231.

Subsequently, the IAEA has repeatedly confi rmed that

Iran is complying with the agreement. However, in May

2018, President Trump pointed out that with the current

agreement, Iran can still be on the verge of a nuclear

breakout in a short period of time even if Iran fully complies

with the agreement, and also the agreement fails to address

Iran’s development of ballistic missiles. He then announced

that the United States would withdraw from the agreement.

In November 2018, the Trump administration resumed all

sanctions that had been lifted under JCPOA[2] and emphasized

its readiness to cut a more comprehensive deal with Iran,

urging Iran to sit down on the negotiating table. Meanwhile,

Iran opposed the resumption of sanctions by the United

States and announced in May 2019 that it would not observe

With Hassan Rouhani winning the presidential election in

Iran in June 2013, the discussions with the E3+3 (the United

Kingdom, France, Germany, the United States, China, and

Russia) were advanced, resulting in the announcement of

the Joint Plan of Action (JPOA) towards the comprehensive

resolution of nuclear issues in November 2013. The execution

of the fi rst step measures of the JPOA commenced in January

2014. On July 14, 2015, the fi nal agreement concerning the

nuclear issues of Iran, the Joint Comprehensive Plan of

Action (JCPOA), was announced. Following this, on July

20, 2015, UN Security Council Resolution 2231 approving

the JCPOA was adopted. In the agreement, it was decided

that Iran would reduce its enriched uranium stockpile and

the number of centrifuges, ban the production of weapons

grade plutonium, and accept IAEA inspections, among

other measures, in exchange for ending the sanctions of

previous UN Security Council resolutions and the U.S. and

EU’s nuclear-related sanctions.[1] On January 16, 2016, the

IAEA released a report confi rming Iran’s completion of the

necessary preparatory steps to start the implementation of


The major nuclear-related restrictions on Iran in the JCPOA include the following: with regard to uranium enrichment, limiting the number of centrifuges for uranium enrichment to 5,060 or
less, keeping the level of uranium enrichment at up to 3.67%, and restricting Iran’s enriched uranium stockpile to 300 kg; and with regard to plutonium production, redesigning and
rebuilding the Arak heavy water reactor to not produce weapons grade plutonium, and shipping spent fuel out of Iran, and not engaging in reprocessing spent fuel including R&D and not
constructing reprocessing facilities. According to then U.S. Secretary of State Kerry, with this agreement, Iran’s breakout time (the time it takes to accumulate the amount of fi ssile material
needed for a single nuclear weapon) will be extended from 90 days or less before the JCPOA to a year or more. Furthermore, the JCPOA is an agreement pertaining to nuclear issues and
does not suspend or lift sanctions related to international terrorism, missiles, human rights, among other issues.

The sanctions include a ban on the Iranian government’s purchases of U.S. dollars, a prohibition on purchases of oil, petroleum products and petrochemical products from Iran, and a ban
on transactions with Iranian fi nancial institutions, including the central bank. In May 2019, Signifi cant Reduction Exceptions, which relate to a ban on some countries and regions’ purchase

the restrictions on the storage of enriched uranium and heavy

water prescribed under JCPOA, while denying an intention

to withdraw from JCPOA. Iran announced the suspension

of its commitment to the uranium enrichment limit in July

as the second step of reducing compliance with JCPOA,

the promotion of unrestricted research and development of

advanced centrifuges in September as the third step, and

the commencement of uranium enrichment activities at the

Fordow Fuel Enrichment Plant (FFEP) in November as the

fourth step. In January 2020, as the fi nal step of reducing

compliance with JCPOA, Iran announced that it would waive

its commitment to the restrictions on enrichment capacity.

In the same month, Britain, France and Germany referred

the developments to the JCPOA Joint Commission under the

JCPOA Dispute Resolution Mechanism and called for Iran

to once again fully fulfi ll its obligations under JCPOA. In

response, Iran said that it would consider withdrawing from

the NPT if the nuclear agreement issue is referred to the UN

Security Council, and that if Europe observes the agreement,

Iran would return to compliance with the agreement.

In the meantime, since May 2019, the United States has

announced the dispatch of carrier strike groups and bomber

units in response to Iran’s threats to its own troops and

interests. In June, Iran announced that it had shot down a

U.S. drone with a surface-to-air missile in its territorial

waters in the Strait of Hormuz. The U.S. acknowledged the

fact that it was shot down, but claimed it was in international

airspace, and revealed that U.S. President Trump had called

off the retaliatory attack at the brink of execution. In July

2019, the U.S. revealed that a U.S. amphibious assault ship

had shot down an Iranian drone over the Strait of Hormuz as

a defensive measure.

Furthermore, in May 2019, an oil pipeline facility in central

Saudi Arabia was attacked by drones, temporarily halting

the transportation of crude oil. In September, an oil facility

in eastern Saudi Arabia was attacked, temporarily halving

the country’s oil production. The Houthis, a Yemeni anti
government armed group allegedly supported by Iran, initially

issued a statement of responsibility for these attacks, but the

United States and others have pointed to Iranian involvement

in the September attacks. Iran has consistently denied this.

In response to this situation, the United States has

expanded the number of U.S. troops deployed to the Middle

East since May 2019 to reinforce its stance against Iran. For

example, in July, it stationed troops in Saudi Arabia for the

fi rst time in nearly 16 years since 2003. In September and

October, it announced the deployment of additional troops,

including air defense missile forces.

On the other hand, since October 2019, there have been

multiple attacks on U.S. military bases in Iraq. In December,

a rocket landed on a base in northern Iraq, killing one

American. The U.S. claimed Iranian involvement in the

attack and bombed the stronghold of Kata'ib Hezbollah,

Iran. In addition, in January 2020, the United States killed

Soleimani, commander of the Quds Force of Iran’s Islamic

Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC), who was operating inside

Iraq with the organization’s leaders, as a deterrent to further

attack plans. The United States has long viewed the activities

of the Quds Force as problematic for supporting terrorist

organizations abroad. In April 2019, it designated the IRGC

as a terrorist organization. Iran carried out a ballistic missile

attack on Iraqi bases hosting U.S. military in retaliation

for the killing of Commander Soleimani. However, the

attack reportedly did not result in any deaths, and Iranian

Foreign Minister Zarif expressed that Iran had completed

commensurate retaliatory measures and did not want further

tensions or war. President Trump also said the same day that

he did not want to use military force against Iran. Both the

Amidst rising tensions in the Middle East, countries

launched efforts to safeguard maritime security in the region.

The United States proposed the Maritime Security Initiative

in July 2019 and established the IMSC with its command

center opened in Bahrain in November. In addition to the

United States, IMSC has been joined by seven countries,

including the United Kingdom, Australia, Saudi Arabia, the

UAE, Bahrain, Albania, and Lithuania (as of April 2020). In

Europe, eight countries (France, the Netherlands, Denmark,

Greece, Belgium, Germany, Italy and Portugal) issued a

statement in January 2020 to politically support the creation

of a European-led maritime surveillance mission in the Strait

of Hormuz (EMASOH). France and the Netherlands have

dispatched their assets so far.

On the other hand, in September 2019, Iran presented a plan

named HOPE (Hormuz Peace Endeavor) as an independent

effort to maintain security in the Persian Gulf and the Strait

of Hormuz, and called on the countries concerned to join. In

addition, in December, Iran conducted the Maritime Safety

Belt, the fi rst trilateral military exercise with the Chinese and

Russian navies in the Gulf of Oman and other areas to ensure

the safety of maritime traffi c routes.

Japan needs to continue to pay close attention to the future

developments surrounding the situation in the Gulf region.

**❹[ Situation in Syria ]**


**Chapter**


Violent clashes in Syria since March 2011 pit four parties,

the Syrian government forces, opposition forces, Islamic

extremist forces, and Kurdish forces against each other.

However, the government forces have gained the upper hand

overall with support from Russia, recapturing Aleppo, which

was once the largest stronghold of rebel forces, the suburbs

of the Syrian capital of Damascus and areas close to the

Syria-Jordan border.

In Idlib, a rebel stronghold even at present, Russia, which

had been supporting Syrian government forces, and Turkey,

which had been backing up rebels, agreed in September

2018 to establish a DMZ Idlib and withdraw heavy artillery

and militant groups from the zone. However, there was no

progress with regard to the withdrawal of the militant groups.

Since April 2019, Syrian government forces and Russian

forces had expanded air and ground operations into Idlib and

besieged some of the Turkish military ceasefire monitoring

stations set up around Idlib. In February 2020, the Turkish

forces dispatched reinforcements to Idlib in response to the

advance of the Syrian government forces, but the forces were

shelled by the Syrian government forces, against which the

Turkish forces retaliated, reportedly causing casualties on


both sides. Subsequently, the fighting between the Turkish

forces and the Syrian government forces expanded. The

Syrian government forces were faced with intensified

resistance from the dissidents and the militants, who were

reinforced by the Turkish forces. The forces and militants

fought back and forth over the key points of traffic through

Idlib. In March 2020, Turkey held a summit with Russia,

which had been backing Syria, and agreed to a ceasefire

in Idlib. Although the Syrian president has expressed his

satisfaction with the agreement, Turkey has warned that

it will resume operations if Syria violates the agreement,

raising a concern about a possible resumption of the battle.

Meanwhile, the peace talks have so far made little

progress. Since January 2016, there have been talks between

the government and opposition forces under UN auspices.

However, the fighting between both sides did not abate,

disrupting the talks. Under the circumstances, peace talks

led by Russia, Turkey, and Iran have continued in Astana

(current Nur-Sultan), Kazakhstan, since January 2017. In

January 2018, the Syrian National Dialogue Congress was

held in Sochi, Russia, where an agreement was reached to

establish a constitutional committee towards the enactment


-----

of a new constitution. In December 2018, Russia, Iran and

Turkey agreed to hold the first meeting of the committee

as early as possible in 2019. The first meeting was held in

October 2019 under the auspices of the UN, but to date there

has been no substantive progress in the political process.

In addition, conflicts among the countries and forces

involved over the Kurds inside Syria have surfaced. In

October 2019, following a telephone summit with Turkey,

the United States issued a statement that Turkey would

soon begin an operation in the northern part of Syria and

that U.S. forces would withdraw from the immediate area

of operation. After the release of the statement, Turkey

launched a military operation against Kurdish forces, which

the country perceives as terrorist organizations, as well as

ISIL, in order to eliminate the terrorist threat from the border

zone with Syria and establish a “safe zone” that would enable

the return of Syrian refugees inside Turkey, and took control

of parts of the northeastern region of Syria. Subsequently,

Turkey and the United States agreed on the suspension of

military operations and the withdrawal of Kurdish forces

from the “safe zone.” Turkey also held talks with Russia, and

agreed on the withdrawal of Kurdish forces from the border

zone and joint patrols by Russian military police and Turkish

forces in northeastern Syria. Over these developments,

Russia’s growing military presence has been noted, including

the reported deployment of a helicopter unit at the airport in

the northeastern Syrian city of Qamishli as part of the patrol

**❺[ Situation in Yemen ]**

In Yemen, following anti-government protests that occurred

from February 2011 and international pressure afterward,

the then President Ali Abdullah Saleh agreed to resign

in accordance with the Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC)

initiative. Through the election held in February 2012, the

then Vice President Abd-Rabbu Mansour Hadi was elected

new President.

Meanwhile, the confrontation intensified between the

government and the opposition insurgent group Houthis,

based in northern Yemen. As the Houthis invaded the Yemeni

capital of Sana and the southern Yemeni city of Aden to

which President Hadi evacuated, the president requested

support from Arab countries. In response, in March 2015,

coalition forces led by Saudi Arabia began air strikes against


operation. Furthermore, the Syrian government agreed with

the Kurdish forces to send the Syrian government troops to

the northeast, advancing into Manbij, one of the Kurdish

forces’ strongholds, which indicates coordination between

the Kurdish forces and the Syrian government to counter

Turkey’s military operations. The agreement was allegedly

mediated by Russia, suggesting that Russia’s influence is

expanding. It has also been pointed out that in the wake of

Turkey’s military operations, counterterrorism activities by

Kurdish forces, which has played a central role in the fight

against ISIL, were suspended, and some ISIL fighters and

their families fled from camps controlled by Kurdish forces.

Moreover, concerning Iranian presence in Syria,

confrontation between Iran and Israel has come to the

surface. In January 2019, Israeli Prime Minister Netanyahu

announced an attack on a weapon storage facility at Syria’s

Damascus Airport, expressing his determination to take

resolute actions against the Iranians in Syria. It is a concern

that the escalation of confrontation between Israel and Iran

would affect Syrian and regional stability.

Amid the still unstable situation in Syria, the United

States said it would leave some of its troops to mop up ISIL.

Relations between various forces over the Syrian situation

have been complicated, with peace talks being stalled.

Further initiatives from the international community towards

the stabilization of Syria are required.

- 

the Houthis. In response, the Houthis also launched attacks

on the mainland of Saudi Arabia with ballistic missiles and

other weapons.

A series of peace talks mediated by the UN took place

between April and August of the same year, but no final

peace agreement was reached, with the talks suspended.

Peace talks were planned for September 2018 but failed to

be implemented with the Houthis refusing to participate.

In December 2018, however, peace talks were held in

Stockholm, the capital of Sweden, leading to the signing

of an agreement on a ceasefire in Hodeidah, which has the

biggest port in the country, and the exchange of prisoners.

In January 2019, the UN Security Council decided to send a

ceasefire monitoring group to Hodeidha.


**Chapter**


-----

Despite the progress in the peace talks, negotiations on

specific measures toward the ceasefire did not go smoothly,

with the terms of the agreement, including the ceasefire in

Hodeidah, failing to be implemented. On the other hand,

the Houthis, stating that they had carried out attacks against

Saudi Arabia, including an attack on an oil facility in Saudi

Aramco in September 2019, declared in September 2019 that

they would cease attacks on the country on the condition that

the coalition forces ceased its air strikes. Also, in November

2019, as there were reports that Saudi Arabia and the Houthis

were engaged in negotiations behind the scenes, Saudi

Arabia announced that it had released 200 Houthi prisoners

of war. In addition, in the same month, the UN Special

Envoy for Yemen reported that airstrikes by the coalition

forces had decreased significantly. Despite the momentum

for a ceasefire, Saudi Arabia carried out air strikes against

the Houthis after a missile launched by the Houthis landed

on a Yemeni government’s military base and killed more

than 100 soldiers in January 2020. In retaliation, the Houthis

announced that they had carried out drone and missile strikes

against oil facilities in southern Saudi Arabia. Since then,

there have been sporadic attacks on Saudi Arabia by the

Houthis, and the Saudi-led coalition has also continued to

**❻[ Situation in Libya ]**

In Libya, following the collapse of the Gaddafi regime

in 2011, elections for a General National Congress were

held in July 2012, establishing a congress consisting

mainly of Islamists. In June 2014, elections for a Council

of Representatives were held to establish a new congress

to replace the General National Congress. However, since

secularists became the majority, the confrontation between

Islamic and secular groups over the transfer of power to the

Council of Representatives intensified, and consequently,

Libya became fragmented between east and west, with two

assemblies existing in parallel – the Islamic groups’ General

National Congress based in the capital city of Tripoli and the

secular groups’ Council of Representatives based in Tobruk

in eastern Libya. In December 2015, the UN mediated

a political agreement for Libya, and the Government of

National Accord (GNA) was established as a national


bomb the Houthis. As such, there is no prospect of a ceasefire

or eventual peace agreement across Yemen.

In addition, it has been pointed out that the Houthis receive

weapons supplies from Iran.[5] In fact, in February 2020, the

U.S. forces announced that it had boarded and inspected a

small vessel in the Arabian Sea and seized a large amount of

weapons from the vessel. The U.S. forces affirmed that the

seized weapons were made in Iran, concluding that they were

intended to be supplied to the Houthis in Yemen, and pointing

to them as a violation of the UN Security Council resolution

prohibiting the supply, sale and transfer of weapons to the

Houthis.

While the situation surrounding the Houthis was changing,

in August 2019, fighting broke out between the Yemeni

government and the Southern Transitional Council (STC), a

separatist group in southern Yemen, which led to the STC’s

occupation of Aden (Yemen’s interim capital). However,

after mediation efforts by Saudi Arabia and others, the

Yemeni government and STC signed the Riyadh Agreement

in Riyadh, the capital of Saudi Arabia, in November 2019.

The agreement established a new government with the

participation of both sides.

- 

consensus government under the agreement. However, as

Islamic groups took control of the new government, secular

groups turned their back and refused to join the GNA. As a

result, Libya remains divided between the east and the west.

Furthermore, militias supporting either the east or the west

have continued sporadic military clashes. In September 2018,

militias active in the west clashed, leading to an emergency

declaration. In April 2019, Commander Hafter’s LNA, the

largest forces in eastern Libya, advanced into a suburb of the

capital city of Tripoli and clashed with militias subordinate

to the GNA in western Libya, leading to an exchange of air

strikes.

Some have pointed out that the fact that both Eastern

and Western forces are receiving military support from the

countries involved, including UAVs, has also led to the

escalation of the war, and the struggle between the two

parties has been described as a drone war. [6] It has also been

pointed out that mercenaries from a Russian private military

company have been dispatched to Libya to support the LNA,

while Turkey has dispatched Turkish forces and the Syrian

fighters it has been supporting to Libya at the request of the

GNA.

Amid this situation, an international conference on Libya

was held in Berlin in January 2020. The conference was

attended by Western countries, including the United States,

the United Kingdom, and France, and Turkey, as well as the

UAE and Egypt, which are said to be supporting the LNA.

The countries agreed to strengthen cooperation toward a

**❼[ Situation in Egypt ]**

In Egypt, where then President Mubarak, who had been

serving as the president for approximately three decades,

resigned in 2011, and then President Mursi, who had been

a member of the Muslim Brotherhood, a Sunni political

organization founded in 1928 as a mass organization

working for the “revival of Islam,” took office. However, in

June 2013, large-scale public protests occurred amidst the

poor economic situation and the deterioration of security.

The military intervened in response and dismissed the

president. In May 2014, then Defense Minister Abdel-Fattah

el-Sisi was inaugurated as president. Since its inauguration,

the el-Sisi administration has undertaken economic reforms

including a shift to a floating exchange rate system and


ceasefire, stop military intervention in Libya, and enforce

an arms embargo. However, the agreement has not yet been

implemented, and Libya continues to be unable to establish

governance and domestic security.

Furthermore, ISIL, Al Qaeda, and other terrorist

organizations are taking advantage of the unstable situation

to expand into Libya, clashing with militias across the

country. In particular, ISIL is believed to have been divided

into small groups and hiding mainly in the southern desert

areas, conducting suicide bombing and other terrorist attacks

in such cities as Tripoli, the capital, indicating that terrorist

attacks may continue in the future.

the abolition of subsidies. However, enhancing domestic

security measures is still a major challenge. In particular,

the country’s mainland was subject to sporadic large-scale

terrorist attacks from 2013, when political turmoil took

place, to 2017, and in November 2018, a terrorist attack

occurred in the central part of the country, targeting Egypt’s

minority Coptic Christians. Moreover, in the Sinai Peninsula,

terrorist attacks on military and police forces have occurred

sporadically mainly in the northern part, while the southern

part is overall peaceful. Since February 2018, Sinai 2018,

a counter-terrorism operation conducted by the Egyptian

Armed Forces, has been underway in the northern part of the

Sinai Peninsula.


**Chapter**


**❽[ Situation in Afghanistan ]**

In Afghanistan, the Taliban intensified its offensive as the

NATO-led RSM launched education, training and advice for

the ANDSF in the wake of ISAF’s withdrawal in December

2014. Meanwhile, the ANDSF faces challenges regarding

logistics, morale, air capabilities, and troop-commander

leadership, allowing the Taliban to expand its control in

Afghanistan. Furthermore, ISIL–KP (Islamic State of Iraq

and the Levant – Khorasan Province) has sustained terrorist

attacks mainly in the capital city of Kabul and eastern

Afghanistan since 2015. As a result, suicide bombing and


assaults in which the Taliban or ISIL is believed to be involved

have occurred one after another across the country, leaving

Afghanistan in an unstable security situation. According to

a report released by the U.S. Special Inspector General for

Afghanistan Reconstruction (SIGAR) in October 2018, the

areas controlled or influenced by the Afghan Government

accounted for approximately 55.5% of Afghan territory, the

lowest since December 2015, when the survey started.

Since the fall of 2018, the United States has conducted

peace talks with the Taliban after appointing Khalilzad as

the Special Representative for Afghanistan Reconciliation.

The talks had some twists and turns, including a three-month

suspension from September 2019, but in February 2020,

an agreement was signed between the United States and

the Taliban that included the conditional phase-out of U.S.

forces in Afghanistan and the start of negotiations among

Afghans. In March 2020, the United States announced that

it had begun the withdrawal of its forces. Also in the same

month, the UN Security Council unanimously adopted a

resolution in support of the agreement. However, the Taliban

**❾[ Situation in South Sudan ]**


have continued their attacks on Afghan security forces after

the agreement. President Ghani, who was re-elected in the

September 2019 presidential election in Afghanistan, held a

presidential inauguration ceremony in March 2020. However,

another candidate accused Ghani of fraud in the election and

held his own presidential inauguration ceremony, causing

political turmoil. Under these circumstances, a close eye

will be kept on the future progress of the agreement between

the United States and the Taliban and the commencement of

negotiations between the Afghans.

- 

In response to the situation, in August 2016, the UN

Security Council created the Regional Protection Force

(RPF) for the purpose of maintaining security in Juba and

surrounding areas. The RPF launched its operations in April

2017. In December 2017 and February and May 2018,

the High-Level Revitalization Forum was held under the

leadership of IGAD, where the government agreed with the

pro-Machar faction and others on the cessation of hostilities.

As a result of the efforts, in June 2018, President Kiir,

former First Vice President Machar and others signed the

“Khartoum Declaration of Agreement on South Sudan,”

which includes a permanent ceasefire. They agreed on

security arrangements in July and on provisional government

arrangements in August, before signing the “Revitalized

Agreement on the Resolution of the Conflict in South Sudan

(R-ARCSS)” in September 2018. Initially, a new provisional

government was scheduled to be established by May 2019.

However, the preparations for its establishment were not

completed by that time. In May 2019, the government

and representatives of the pro-Machar faction agreed on

the extension of the pre-transitional period by six months.

In November, they further agreed to extend the period for

another 100 days. On February 22, 2020, the last day of

the pre-transitional period, a provisional government was

established.

**Chapter**


The second North-South civil war in Sudan, which had

continued since 1983, came to an end in 2005 with the entry

into force of the Comprehensive Peace Agreement (CPA). In

July 2011, the Republic of South Sudan was separated and

gained independence from the Republic of the Sudan. At the

same time, the UN Mission in the Republic of South Sudan

(UNMISS) was established.

However, after the independence, a political confrontation

emerged between a mainstream faction led by President

Salva Kiir Mayardit, a Dinka, and a nonmainstream faction

including Vice President Riek Machar, a Nuer.

The “Intergovernmental Authority on Development”

(IGAD) assisted by the UN and the AU initiated efforts to

start dialogues among South Sudanese leaders and enable

their reconciliation. In January 2014, the government and the

pro-Machar faction signed an agreement on ceasing hostile

activities.

In August 2015, the government, the pro-Machar faction

and others reached the Agreement on the Resolution of the

Conflict in the Republic of South Sudan (ARCSS), the key

elements of which include the establishment of a transitional

government. In April 2016, the Transitional Government of

National Unity was established, in which Mr. Kiir serves as

president and Mr. Machar as first vice president.

In July 2016, a shooting occurred in Juba between the

security forces of President Kiir and First Vice President

Machar. After First Vice President Machar fled the country,

and President Kiir dismissed First Vice President Machar,

clashes started to occur again between the government and

the Machar faction.

with the approval of the UN Security Council. As a result

of attacks by the AMISOM forces and mop-up operations

by the Somali government forces under reconstruction with

support from Western countries, Al-Shabaab lost its control

on major cities and weakened to some extent. However, its

threat has still existed. Al-Shabaab frequently stages attacks

against the bases of the Somali and AMISOM forces and

terrorist attacks within Somalia and in AMISOM member

countries. It has been pointed out that ISIL fighters have been

flowing into Somalia in recent years.

In Somalia, especially in its northeastern part, there are


believed to be outposts of pirates who are active off the

coast of Somalia and in the Gulf of Aden. The international

community has continued anti-piracy operations and

implemented a series of initiatives to enhance the security

capabilities of Somalia based on the perception that

instability of Somalia has caused the piracy issue. As a result,

the number of reported pirate attacks has remained low.

With a presidential election anticipated around the end

of 2020 or later, we should keep paying close attention to

whether the situation in Somalia will start to stabilize, while

also looking at the international community’s response.

October 2019, cited such targets as the acceleration of AI
technology development, support for scientifi c research, and
the improvement of human resources development systems.
AI-using technologies being studied include situation
assessment support systems to display data collected
through various sensors in an easy-to-understand manner,
as well as decision-making support systems to provide
commanders with available options. The United States
conducted demonstration tests on the Advanced Battle
Management System (ABMS) in December 2019. The
system is reportedly designed to link various systems to
networks, analyze collected data with AI, and allow combat
troops to promptly access the data. It is noted that China is
interested in introducing AI-based decision-making support
systems for commanders, allegedly having a plan to develop
a decision-making support system for nuclear-powered
submarine commanders.
The United States, China, and Russia are developing
autonomous unmanned vehicles equipped with AI.
Autonomous unmanned vehicles would generally combine
unmanned vehicles technologies expected to be utilized
in dangerous, dirty, and dull missions with AI technology
capable of detecting adversary actions and battle situation
changes, and enables intelligence, surveillance and

Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) is developing
AI-equipped unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs), including
swarms of reusable, air-launched and air-recovered small
UAVs for ISR missions, as well as unmanned surface vessels
for locating submarines. Under its Gremlins program, for
example, DARPA conducted the fi rst fl ight test for the

fi eld, including the application for autonomous unmanned
vehicles and the cyber domain as well as supporting
for command and decision-making and improving data
processing capacity, among other areas.
The United States, China, and Russia have formulated
their AI strategies and promoted relevant research and
development under industry-government-academia
collaboration. The U.S. Department of Defense (DoD)
established the Joint Artifi cial Intelligence Center (JAIC) in
June 2018 and indicated its policy of using AI in a lawful
and ethical manner in “Summary of the 2018 Department
of Defense Artifi cial Intelligence Strategy” released in
February 2019. The Chinese government announced the
“Next Generation AI Development Plan” in 2017, setting
a target for China to become a major global AI innovation
center by 2030. In Russia, President Vladimir Putin in 2017
acknowledged that AI leaders would rule the world. Its

In May 2018, China Electronics Technology Group
Corporation successfully performed a swarm fl ight of 200
AI-equipped unmanned vehicles, demonstrating its advanced
AI technology. It is assumed that military operations
including such swarm fl ights will be diffi cult to counter
with conventional air defense systems. The Caihong-7 (CH7), whose prototype was exhibited at the Airshow China,
China International Aviation and Aerospace Exhibition,
in November 2018, is described as a fi ghter UAV that can
perform advanced autonomous fl ights.
Russia is developing a nuclear-powered unmanned
underwater vehicle (Poseidon) that can carry nuclear
warheads, claiming that it has been tested successfully.
Some have argued that autonomous unmanned vehicles
could develop into so-called Lethal Autonomous Weapons
Systems (LAWS). Within the framework of the United
Nations Convention on Certain Conventional Weapons
(CCW), discussion on LAWS is continued from the
perspectives of their characteristics, human elements, and
international law.
Meanwhile, some people indicate that UAVs would not acquire
the autonomy at the same level as human pilots until 2040.

（2）Hypersonic Weapons

The United States, China, and Russia are developing
hypersonic weapons, including Hypersonic Glide Vehicles
(HGVs) that would be launched from ballistic missiles,
maneuvered to glide at hypersonic speed (Mach 5 or above)
after their entry into the atmosphere, and hit targets, as well as
Hypersonic Cruise Missiles (HCMs) using scramjet engines
and other technologies that enable hypersonic fl ights. It is
suggested that hypersonic weapons would fl y in lower orbits
than ballistic missiles at hypersonic speed above Mach 5
for a longer period of time and have high maneuverability,
which makes it diffi cult to be detected and intercepted.
The United States, in its Missile Defense Review
(MDR) (January 2019), indicates that Russia and China are
developing advanced hypersonic weapons that challenge
existing missile defense systems. The United States also
announced in March 2020 that it had conducted a successful
fl ight test on hypersonic weapons.

In the military parade to mark the 70th anniversary of
China’s founding in October 2019, the DF-17 ballistic
missile viewed as capable of carrying an HGV made its fi rst
public appearance, suggesting the possibility that hypersonic
weapons would be deployed as early as in 2020. Russia
announced its deployment of an HGV called “Avangard.”
It is also continuing the development of an HCM called
“Zircon.”


（3） High-power Energy Technology

High-power energy weapons, such as electromagnetic
railguns, high-power laser weapons, and high-power
microwaves, are being developed as a means to counter
various airborne threats.

generated from electric energy to launch projectiles. U.S.
Forces aim to develop a railgun with a range of approximately
370 km, about 10 times that of the existing 5-inch (127mm)
guns. Unlike missiles, projectiles for electromagnetic
railguns have no propulsion systems and are smaller, less
costly, and can be stored in smaller space, which supposedly
makes it possible for electromagnetic railguns to efficiently
counter massive missile attacks, if they become available for
intercepting missiles. The United States has offered plans to
mount electromagnetic railguns on warships by 2025 and to
use electromagnetic railguns not only for anti-ground and
anti-ship attacks but also for anti-aircraft attacks. It is pointed
out that China has tested its railguns at sea and would deploy
them by 2025.

The United States, China, and Russia are developing highpower laser weapons to destroy targets with laser energy. Laser
weapons are expected as an effective and less costly means
to intercept attacks by multiple small unmanned vehicles and
boats. Though it depends on the technological maturity, highpower laser weapons would excel in the speed of response
compared with conventional weapons, and they can be free
from ammunition constraints. Therefore, laser weapons,
if strengthened enough to intercept missiles, would be able
to efficiently counter massive missile attacks. The U.S. Air
Force acquired an anti-UAV laser system in 2019. The United
States has also successfully tested a 30 kW ship-based solid
laser weapon system (LaWS) to counter small UAVs in the
Persian Gulf since 2014. In a test conducted in the Pacific
Ocean in 2020, the U.S. Navy successfully neutralized a
flying unmanned vehicle with its shipboard high-powered
laser demonstrator. The United States is planning to test
mount an Aegis ship with the 100 kW HELIOS solid laser
weapon system available for countering projectiles in 2020.
China exhibited the 30-100 kW “Silent Hunter” laser
weapon system, capable of countering small UAVs, at the
IDEX 2017 international defense exhibition. It is pointed out
that China is developing higher-power laser weapon systems
to attack satellites.
It is suggested that Russia has deployed the 10 kW Peresvet
laser weapon system and been developing a megawatt-class
chemical laser weapon system for attacking satellites.
High-power microwave technology can cause destruction
and malfunction in the electronic systems responsible for
such functions as intelligence-gathering and command &
communications aboard UAVs, missiles and other airborne
threats. The United States has acquired the Phaser highpower microwave system in 2019. In a U.S. Army drill, the
system reportedly countered two to three UAVs at one time
and 33 UAVs in total.

（4） Quantum Technology


Quantum technology is positioned as an important
technology which brings innovation to society by applying
quantum mechanics that differs from familiar physics that
people sense every day. For example, quantum cryptographic
communications is a communication system which utilizes
quantum cryptographic technology taking advantage of
quantum characteristics, and reportedly cannot be deciphered
by third parties. It is pointed out that quantum radar may be
able to neutralize the stealth advantage of stealth aircraft
by utilizing quantum characteristics. It is pointed out that
quantum computers can compute problems in a short amount
of time and with less electricity consumption than existing
supercomputers and can also be applied to areas such as
decryption.
China has developed the world’s longest quantum
cryptographic communications network, extending over
approximately 3,000 km and connecting Beijing and
Shanghai. In addition, in August 2016, China launched
“Mozi,” the world’s first satellite to test quantum
cryptographic communications. In January 2018, China
said that it succeeded in using Mozi for long-distance
quantum cryptographic communication between China and

processing control using AI. The U.S. Defense Innovation
Board (DIB) has evaluated 5G as a promising technology that
can improve real-time information sharing, communications
across military service branches, geographic divergence,
and territories, and enhance the ability to connect multiple
systems to a broader network.[1]

Addictive manufacturing technology as typified by threedimensional printing can produce goods that are too complex
to be produced conventionally, at a much lower cost. Given
this, 3D printer technology can bring revolutionary changes in
logistics, such as not depending on the stock when procuring
parts, and nations point out the military use of the technology.
For example, the U.S. Army named 3D printer technology
as one of the top 10 technologies regarding science and
technology development on its website in December 2019,
noting that the technology could trigger a real logistics
revolution by making the transportation of spare goods
unnecessary. In February 2019, Finland, France, Germany,
the Netherlands, Poland, Sweden, and Norway launched a
four-year joint project to study potential applications of 3D
printer technology. The Australian Navy is considering using
3D printers for producing parts for patrol boats. In India,
state-run and private companies agreed in January 2020 to
cooperate in a 3D printer project for armed forces.


（5） Other Civilian Technologies Seen as Available for
Defense Purposes

As civilian technological innovation has been remarkable,
each major country has been trying to proactively utilize
cutting-edge civilian technologies for defense purposes.
For example, fifth-generation (5G) mobile communication
systems, subjected to commercial services in various countries
from April 2019 as a new civilian mobile communication
infrastructure, have been attracting attention. The 5G
systems achieve far faster speed, less delays, larger capacity
and more simultaneous connections than the previous 4G
systems. Compared to 4G systems, 5G technology allows for
providing services with better quality (high speed, low latency,
high capacity, high number of simultaneous connections,
and high reliability) despite complicated data processing,
by combining advanced information communications
technologies, including directional antennas to communicate
in higher frequency bands, data processing quality-based
segregation and decentralization in the cloud space, and data

European Defence Fund (EDF)[3] to provide funding for joint
research and development by the EU member states in order
to promote their cooperation in developing and acquiring
defense equipment and facilitate the efficient production of
state-of-the-art and interoperable equipment.
There is an increasing number of cases where governments
provide funding for national defense-related research and
development conducted by the private sector. In the United
States, for example, approximately US$3.556 billion
in research and development funding was requested for
FY2020 for DARPA, whose mission is to make investments
in breakthrough technologies that will contribute to national
security. The U.S. defense authority has long provided
substantial funding for the research conducted by companies
and universities. In some other countries, such as the United
Kingdom and Australia, responding to the recent utilization
of dual-use technologies in defense equipment development,
the governments have launched initiatives to provide
funding for private sector research and development on
innovative technologies in order to acquire advanced civilian
technologies. [4]

measures to promote exports. While the United States,
Russia, European countries and China have remained as
leading defense equipment exporters, countries such as the
Republic of Korea (ROK) and Turkey have been expanding
exports of affordable equipment, which is an outcome of their
success in developing the equipment manufacturing bases,
together with their history of importing equipment in the past
and improvement of capabilities in science and technology.
Defense equipment imports by Asian and Oceanian
countries have continued an uptrend in recent years,
seemingly against the background of economic growth in the
region as well as the expansion of the influence of China, the
existence of territorial disputes, and responses to the military
buildup in neighboring countries.
Some of defense equipment importing countries adopt
offset policies[5] in order to keep a good balance between
improving defense capabilities through imports and
developing domestic defense technological and industrial
bases by requesting domestic companies’ participation
in parts production and others as conditions for procuring
equipment and services from abroad.

**Trends in Space Domain**
**2**


**❶** **[Space Domain and Security ]**

Approximately 60 years have passed since a satellite was
launched into outer space for the fi rst time in the history of
mankind. In recent years, technology leveraging outer space
has been applied to various areas, growing more important
as key infrastructure for both the public and private sectors.
As the Outer Space Treaty, which took effect in October
1967, stipulates that outer space is not subject to national
appropriation and that all states parties to the treaties shall
use it freely for peaceful purposes, major countries have been
making proactive efforts to use outer space for maintaining
peace and safety in the security area.
There is no concept of national borders in outer space,
meaning that the utilization of satellites enables the
observation of, communication at, and positioning on any
area on the Earth. Thus, major countries make efforts to
enhance the capabilities of a variety of satellites and launch
them for the purpose of enhancing C4ISR (command, control,
communication, computer, intelligence, surveillance, and
reconnaissance), functions. Such satellites include satellites
for reconnoitering military facilities and targets, early
warning satellites for detecting the launch of ballistic missiles,
satellites for gathering radio signals, communication satellites
for communications between military units, and satellites
for the positioning, navigation and time synchronization of
naval vessels and aircraft and enhancing the precision of
weapons systems. In outer space, various countries are thus
rapidly developing their capabilities to ensure their military
superiority.
From the viewpoint of ensuring their military superiority,
various countries are also rapidly developing their capabilities


to impede each other’s use of outer space. In January 2007,
China conducted a test to destroy its aging satellite with a
ground-launched missile. Russia also conducted a similar
test in April 2020. Space debris caused by directly destroying
satellites spread across the satellite’s orbit and came to be
seen as a risk against space assets such as satellites owned by
various countries.
Furthermore, countries including China and Russia
are thought to be also developing an anti-satellite weapon
(ASAT) that does not directly hit and destroy a satellite by a
missile, thus creating less space debris. For example, it has
been noted that ASATs under development include a “killer
satellite” to approach a target satellite and utilize a robot arm
to capture the target and disable its functions. On this point,
it has been noted that China has carried out experiments in
outer space in which they have maneuvered satellites close to
other satellites to simulate the movements of a killer satellite.
The United States has claimed that a satellite launched by
Russia in 2017 fi red a high-speed fl ying object, exhibiting
characteristics of a weapon. It has also criticized Russia for
launching in 2019 another satellite that actively maneuvers
near a U.S. satellite and had an “unusual and disturbing
behavior” and condemned that such activity has the potential
to create dangerous situations in outer space.
Furthermore, it has been pointed out that China and Russia
are developing not only missiles and killer satellites but also
jammers for interfering with communications between target
satellites and ground stations, and laser weapons for attacking
target satellites with directed energy. It has also been noted
that China and Russia have been enhancing capabilities to

operate these anti-satellite capabilities and impede the United

States and its allies from using outer space.[1] While threats
in outer space, including the development of such various
countermeasures, are pointed out to be growing, the United
States and other countries increasingly position outer space
as a warfi ghting domain or an operational domain, making
outer space security an urgent challenge.
As the above illustrates, the risk to the stable use of outer space
has become one of the critical security challenges for countries,
thus it has become necessary to deal with this risk effectively in
an effort to ensure stability in the use of outer space.
Against this backdrop, the existing international
agreements do not have direct provisions on prohibiting

the destruction of space objects and refraining from actions
triggering space debris. Discussion on guidelines has been
under way recently by the United Nations Committee on
the Peaceful Uses of Outer Space (COPUOS) and the InterAgency Space Debris Coordination Committee (IADC).
Moreover, countries are working on Space Situational
Awareness (SSA) by monitoring the solar activity with a
potential impact on satellites and electronic equipment on
the Earth, and threats caused by meteors reaching Earth, in
addition to threats posed by ASATs and space debris to space
assets.

Among U.S. government organizations, the National
Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) under
direct control by the President is responsible mainly
for non-military space development, while the DoD
undertakes research, development, and operation of military
observation and reconnaissance satellites. In August 2019,
the United States inaugurated the U.S. Space Command as
a new geographic unifi ed combatant command based on
the Strategic Command’s component in charge of space
missions. In December 2019, the United States created the
Space Force under the Department of the Air Force as the
sixth military branch, with approximately 16,000 personnel.

See Chapter 2, Section 1-2 (Military Posture)


**1 The United States**

Since its fi rst satellite launch in January 1958, the United
States has proceeded with a variety of space activities in fi elds
including military, science, and resource exploration, such
as launching the world’s fi rst reconnaissance satellite and
landing on the Moon. Today, the United States is the world’s
leading space power. The U.S. Forces clearly recognize the
importance of outer space for their actions, and on this point,
actively utilize outer space for security purposes.
The U.S. National Security Strategy (NSS) released in
December 2017 pointed out that some countries are pursuing
a variety of ASATs on the basis of belief that the capability
to attack assets in outer space will give them asymmetrical
advantages. It also indicated that unlimited access to and
freedom in activities in outer space were vital interests
of the United States, and that the National Space Council
would consider long-term goals in outer space to develop
strategies. The United States released its National Space
Strategy in March 2018, demonstrating its recognition that
its adversaries had turned space into a warfi ghting domain
and vowing to deter and defeat threats in the space domain
to protect the national interests of the United States and its
allies. The National Intelligence Strategy (NIS) announced in
January 2019 indicated the recognition of threats in the space
domain of which the previous NIS made no mention, warning
that adversaries were increasing their presence in the space
domain with plans to exceed the United States in some areas.
The National Military Strategy (NMS) announced in July
2019 introduced the notion of an operational art through the
integration of joint capabilities in all domains, giving priority
to space and cyberspace in addition to land, sea and air.


**Chapter**


**2 China**

China began working on space development in the 1950s and
launched its fi rst satellite “Dong Fang Hong I” in 1970. China
has thus far conducted activities such as crewed space fl ight
and lunar rover launches. In January 2019, China succeeded
in landing unmanned spacecraft “Chang’e 4” on the far side
of the moon, the fi rst ever such attempt and landing. It is
speculated that China’s space development is intended to
enhance national prestige and develop space resources.
In its 2019 defense white paper, released in July 2019
and titled “China’s National Defense in the New Era,” China
asserts that outer space is a critical domain in international
strategic competition and that outer space security provides
strategic assurance for national and social development.
“China’s Space Activities in 2016,” China’s white paper
on space activities released in December 2016, presented
a vision to “build China into a space power” and for “the

realization of the Chinese Dream. It also gave a schedule to
launch lunar, Mars, asteroid, and Jupiter explorers by around
2020.
While traditionally emphasizing international cooperation
and the peaceful use of space, China has not ruled out its
military use of space and proactively used space for military
purposes, including information collection, communications,
and positioning through satellites. China continues to develop
ASATs. In January 2007, China conducted a test using a
ground-launched missile for destroying its own satellite.
In July 2014, China implemented an anti-satellite missile
test[2] without actually destroying any satellite. It is also
suggested that China is developing killer satellites, jammers,
and directed-energy weapons,[3] including laser beams. It is
pointed out that the BeiDou satellite positioning system,
which reportedly started global services in December 2018,
could be used for military purposes. A Chinese state-owned
corporation, which develops and produces launch vehicles,
has claimed to continue the launch of new rockets in the
Long March series and develop a launch vehicle that can
carry a large satellite. However, the corporation has been
reported to have been developing and producing ballistic
missiles as well, indicating that the technology used in the
development of satellite launch vehicles is applicable to the
development of ballistic missiles. China is thus expected
to focus on space development through close cooperation
between government, military, and private sectors. China is
considered to have become one of the space powers through
investments, research and development, and the introduction
of technologies from the United States and other countries. It
has been suggested that China could threaten U.S. superiority
in outer space in the future.[4]

The Strategic Support Force, established in December
2015 as a force under direct control by the Central Military
Commission, is considered to be in charge of outer space,
cyber, and electronic warfare missions, including the
launching and tracking of satellites, although the details
of its missions and organization have not been published.
The Equipment Development Department of the Central
Military Commission is believed to be in charge of crewed
space programs. The Ministry of Science and Technology
takes charge of planning and making China’s science
and technology policy covering outer space. The State
Administration for Science, Technology and Industry for
National Defense, which belongs to the State Council’s

**3** Russia

Russia’s space activities have been continuing since
the former Soviet Union era. The former Soviet Union
successively launched multiple satellites after it launched the
first satellite in the history of mankind, Sputnik 1, in October
1957, and had the largest number of launched satellites in
the world until the collapse of the Soviet Union. Russia’s
space activities have declined since the former Soviet Union
collapsed in 1991. However, the country has recently started
to expand its space activities once again.
Regarding the country’s trends in security, the National
Security Strategy, approved in December 2015, states that
the opportunities for maintaining global and regional stability
are shrinking significantly with the deployment of the U.S.
weapons in outer space. In response to the United States’
release of the annual MDR in 2018, Russia expressed concern
that the implementation of plans in the MDR would trigger
an arms race in space with hugely negative consequences for
world peace and stability.
In March 2016, Russia released the Federal Space
Program for 2016-2025 as a specific future guideline for
space activities, including the development and deployment
of domestic space satellites and crewed flight programs.
Meanwhile, it is pointed out that Russia has used its
outer space capabilities for military operations in Syria and
reconnoitering globally operating forces of the United States

and its allies.[5] It is also noted that Russia has continued

ASAT development, repeated tests to fire ground-launched
anti-satellite missiles, and has been developing anti-satellite
missiles launched from MiG-31 fighter jets, as well as laser
weapon systems, such as the Sokol Eshelon system for
aircraft.
From an organizational perspective, State Space
Corporation ROSCOSMOS is in charge of space activities
related to Russia’s scientific and economic areas, while the
Russian Ministry of Defence is involved in space activities
for security purposes. The Russian Aerospace Forces, into
which the Air Force and the Aerospace Defence Forces were
integrated in August 2015, conduct actual space activities
for military purposes and manage facilities for launching
satellites.

**5** India


India has promoted programs to develop communications,
positioning and observation satellites. At the end of January
2019, it released a space mission calling for promoting
research and development on a crewed space initiative by
2020. At their second meeting of their foreign and defense
ministers in December 2019, the United States and India
offered to discuss their potential defense cooperation in outer
space in 2020.
India is believed to have operated the Navigation Indian
Constellation (NavIC) satellite as a positioning satellite that
can position locations around India and launched an Earth
observation satellite, which is believed to be used for security
purposes as well. In February 2017, India successfully
launched a satellite launch vehicle loaded with 104 satellites
at low cost, marking the largest number ever carried on a single
rocket in the world, which indicates its high technological
capabilities. In March 2019, Prime Minister Modi announced
that the country successfully tested a missile to shoot down
a low-orbit satellite.
Among organizations, the Space Agency oversees
the Indian Space Research Organization (ISRO), which
implements space development policy, develops and launches
launch vehicles, and develops and manufactures satellites.
It has been reported that the Ministry of Defence approved
the creation of the Defence Space Agency (DSA) to control
ASATs and other space assets, and to plan defense policies
regarding outer space in April 2019. The ministry also
approved the establishment of the Defence Space Research
Agency (DSRA) to develop weapons and technology for
outer space warfare in June 2019.

**6** The ROK


Regarding European outer space activities, the EU, the
European Space Agency (ESA), and European countries
are promoting their own unique space activities and are
cooperating with each other to implement space activities.
France succeeded in launching its own satellite for the first
time in 1965, and the United Kingdom in 1971. Italy and
Germany used launch vehicles developed by the United
States to own satellites in 1964 and 1965, respectively.
Meanwhile, the ESA launched its first satellite in 1979.
The EU and ESA at their joint ministerial council meeting
in 2007 approved the European Space Policy, which noted
that it would be important to improve synergy effects
between space activities for civil and defense purposes and
secure space activities based on coordinated efforts among
member states and an internationally competitive space
industry, identifying security as one of the policy priorities.
In September 2019, before taking office as President of the
European Commission, Ursula von der Leyen stated she
would establish a defense and space branch to take charge of
military fundraising, development and deployment within the
commission. A satellite positioning system called “Galileo”
and an Earth observation program named “Copernicus”
under planning by the EU and ESA, and a reconnaissance
satellite project called “Multinational Space-based Imaging
System (MUSIS)” of the European Defense Agency (EDA)
are expected to be utilized for the security field in Europe.
In July 2019, France released the Space Defence Strategy
as its first document specialized in space defense. The
document referred to the creation of a space command and
the enhancement of threat identification and space situation
surveillance capabilities. In September 2019, France created
the space command under the Air Force to integrate functions
and personnel of a military space surveillance operation


**Chapter**


The ROK is considered to have started full-scale space
development from the latter half of the 1990s. Current space
development is promoted based on the Third Basic Space
Development Promotion Plan announced by the Moon
administration under the Space Development Promotion Act
implemented in 2005. The plan proposes a vision towards
2040, giving priority to (1) the establishment of its own
launch vehicle technology, (2) the advancement of satelliteusing services and satellite development, (3) the initiation
of space exploration, and (4) the development of the Korean
Positioning System (KPS).
In November 2018, the ROK, which had traditionally
depended on other countries for launching satellites,
announced that it successfully tested the “Nuri” domestic

**Trends in Cyber Domain**

**3**


**❶ [Cyberspace and Security ]**

Owing to the advancement of information and

communications technology (ICT) in recent years,

information and communications networks such as the

Internet have become essential components across all facets

of life. Therefore, cyber attacks against information and

communications networks have the potential to seriously

impact the lives of individuals.

Types of cyber attacks include functional disruption, data

falsifi cation and data theft caused by unauthorized access to

information and communications networks or through the

transmission of viruses via e-mail, functional impairment

of the networks through simultaneous transmission of large

quantities of data, and attacks intended to shut down or

take over a system belonging to critical infrastructure, such

as power systems. Also, network-related technologies are

constantly evolving, with cyber attacks becoming more and

more advanced and sophisticated by the day.

For military forces, information and communications

capability form the foundation of command and control,

which extend from central command to ground-level forces.

In this regard, ICT advancements are further increasing

the dependence of military forces on information and

communications networks. Furthermore, in some cases,

military forces need various critical infrastructures, including

electricity, to execute their missions. Accordingly, cyber

attacks against such critical infrastructures could become a

major impediment to their missions. For this reason, cyber

attacks are recognized as an asymmetrical means to impede

the military activities of adversaries at low cost. It is believed

that many foreign military forces are developing offensive

capabilities in cyberspace. It has been pointed out that China

and Russia in particular are bolstering the offensive cyber

capabilities of their militaries for the purpose of obstructing

the networking of adversaries’ military forces and destroying

their infrastructure.[1]

- 

their military forces have enhanced their offensive cyber

capabilities.


**Chapter**


Under such circumstances, cyber attacks have frequently

been carried out against information and communications

networks of not only government organizations and

military forces but also business corporations and academic

organizations in various countries. Attacks attempting to

steal critical technologies, secrets or personal information

have been confi rmed. For example, advanced persistent

threat (APT) and other relentless cyber attacks focusing on

specifi c bodies require abundant resources, arrangements and

capabilities, being viewed as organized activities. To respond

to such advanced cyber attacks, Japan is required to share

threat awareness with foreign countries for technological and

operational cooperation. The United States has assessed that

China, Russia, Iran and North Korea have been conducting

more diverse and aggressive cyber attacks,[2] indicating that

It has been alleged that cyber warfare units have been formed

under the Strategic Support Force that was created as part of

China’s military reforms in late December 2015. The units

are estimated to consist of 175,000 troops, including 30,000

for cyber attacks. In its “National Cyberspace Security

Strategy” published in 2016, China recognized sovereignty

in cyberspace as an important component part of national

sovereignty. Its 2019 defense white paper, released in July

2019 and titled “China’s National Defense in the New Era,”

academic organizations and other targets.

-  In 2017, a U.S. consumer credit information company came

under a cyber attack stealing personal information including

names, birthdates, social security numbers, driver’s license

numbers, and credit card numbers. In February 2020,

the U.S. Department of Justice prosecuted four Chinese

military-related persons for their alleged involvement in

the cyber attack.

China is suspected of conducting cyber attacks and other

activities to steal confi dential information even in peacetime.[3]

For example, its involvement in the following incidents has

been pointed out.

-  In June 2015, the U.S. Offi ce of Personnel Management

(OPM) became a target of a cyber attack in which, as it

later came to light, personal information of about 22

million people, including U.S. federal employees and U.S.

Forces personnel, were stolen.[4]

-  In January and February 2018, Chinese government

hackers hacked a U.S. Navy contractor, leading to a leak

of classifi ed information on supersonic anti-ship missiles

mounted on submarines.

-  In December 2018, such countries as the United States

announced that the APT10 cyber group related to China’s

Ministry of National Security conducted cyber attacks on

intellectual and other properties in at least 12 countries.


It has been pointed out that the Main Intelligence Directorate

of the General Staff of the Russian Armed Forces (GRU) and

the Federal Security Service of the Russian Federation (FSB)

are involved in cyber attacks. It has also been revealed that

the Russian military has its own cyber command unit,[5] which

is believed to be responsible for conducting offensive cyber

activities, including inserting malware into command and

control systems of adversaries,[6] with approximately 1,000

personnel. Russia’s “Doctrine of Information Security,”

released in December 2016, acknowledged an increase

in threats related to the use of information technology for

military and political purposes. In November 2019, Russia

enforced the so-called sovereign Internet law to secure the

continuity of Russian networks by shutting them out from

global networks in the event of an incident like a cyber attack.

It is pointed out that Russia has taken advantage of

cyberspace for intelligence operations not only to steal

information and conduct sabotage operations but also to

challenge democratic processes[7] and has been involved in

the following incidents:

U.S. government indicted four hackers, including two

officers of the Russian Federal Security Service, for their

alleged cyber attack on the company.[8]

-  In December 2015, a cyber attack triggered a large-scale

power outage in Ukraine. It was reported that military

forces of Russia confronting with Ukraine over the Crimea

annexation and other issues were suspected of having

contributed to the cyber attack.

February 2018, the U.S. and U.K. governments attributed

the attacks to the Russian military.

-  In October 2018, the U.S. and U.K. governments announced

that the Main Intelligence Directorate of the GRU was

responsible for cyber attacks on the World Anti-Doping

Agency, the Organization for the Prohibition of Chemical

Weapons, the U.S. Democratic convention, and other targets.

-  In February 2020, U.S., U.K., Georgian and other governments

following incidents.

-  In September 2016, cyber attacks occurred in the internal

network of the ROK Armed Forces. In May 2017, the

ROK Ministry of National Defense was reported to have

concluded that the cyber attacks had been conducted by

what was believed to be a North Korean hacker group.[12]

Moreover, it has been pointed out that documents

containing military secrets of the ROK were stolen through

the cyber attacks.

-  In May 2017, a cyber attack used a malware called

WannaCry to encrypt and neutralize electronic data held

by hospitals, schools, businesses, and other entities in more

than 150 countries. Japan, the United States, the United

Kingdom, Australia, Canada, and New Zealand announced

a statement blaming North Korea for its involvement in

the attack. It has been pointed out that this cyber attack

succeeded in collecting 140,000 dollars in Bitcoins.

-  In September 2017, multiple U.S. electric power utilities

were inflicted with cyber attacks using spear phishing

emails. In October 2017, FireEye, a U.S. cybersecurity

company, announced that the attacks had been conducted

by a cyber threat group allegedly affiliated with North

Korea.

-  According to the final report released by the Panel of

Experts of the UN Security Council Sanctions Committee

on North Korea in April 2020, the Panel concluded, based

on information provided by member states and publicly

available information, that North Korea has continued

to carry out cyber attacks on financial institutions and

cryptocurrency exchanges and that the attacks are becoming

more sophisticated.

**4** Trends Concerning Other Threats


**Chapter**


It has been pointed out that the North Korean authority trains

hackers[11] and has intensively built up cyber units operating

some 6,800 personnel.[12] In September 2019, the U.S.

Department of the Treasury announced sanctions targeting

three cyber groups[13] supported by the North Korean authority

responsible for their involvement in malicious cyber activities

targeting key infrastructure.

control systems are also pointed out. In this respect, the

U.S. Congress in August 2018 passed the National Defense

Authorization Act of 2019 including provisions prohibiting

government agencies from using products of major Chinese

communications equipment manufacturers, such as Huawei

Technologies Co. The United States has provided its allies

with information about risks accompanying Chinese

communications equipment and urged them not to use

such equipment. In response, Australia has banned China’s

next-generation mobile network development project.

Cyber attacks on telecommunication networks of a

government and military forces or on critical infrastructure

could have a serious effect on the security of states, and it is

believed that state-sponsored cyber attacks have been on the

rise in recent years. Given this situation, there is a need for

continuous monitoring of trends in the threats in cyberspace.

- 

and the continued integration of cyber capabilities into the

full spectrum of military operations. Furthermore, the DoD

Cyber Strategy (September 2018) points out that the United

States is engaged in a long-term strategic competition with

China and Russia, and that China and Russia have expanded

that competition to include persistent campaigns in and

through cyberspace that pose long-term strategic risk to

the United States as well as to its allies and partners. The

strategy presents such approaches as (1) the acceleration of

cyber capability development, (2) defense to counter and

deter malicious cyber activity, and (3) the promotion of

cooperation with U.S. allies and partners.

In April 2019, at the U.S.-Japan Security Consultative

Committee (2+2), the two countries agreed to enhance

cooperation on cyber issues and affirmed that international

law applies in cyberspace and that a cyber attack could, in

certain circumstances, constitute an armed attack for the

purposes of the U.S.-Japan Security Treaty.

The U.S. Forces include Cyber Command, which was

elevated to a unified combatant command in May 2018 to

control cyberspace operations. The Command consists of

the Cyber Protection Force (68 teams), which operates and

defends the DoD Information Network, the Cyber National

Mission Force (13 teams), which supports the U.S. defense

against national-state threats, and the Cyber Combat Mission

Force (27 teams), which supports the operations conducted

by unified combatant commands on the cyber front (these

three Forces are collectively referred to as the Cyber Mission

Force, consisting of 133 teams including 25 support teams,

with approximately 6,200 personnel).


Given these growing threats in cyberspace, various initiatives

are under way.

It is regarded that the international community has

diverging views concerning the fundamental matters of

cyberspace, including how international law applies. For

instance, the United States, Europe, and Japan have called

for maintaining a free cyberspace, while Russia, China, and

most emerging countries sought to strengthen state control

on cyberspace. Against this backdrop, there has been a

movement to promote the rule of law in cyberspace in the

international community. For instance, discussions are being

held on the establishment of international rules within the

framework of global conferences on cyberspace.

See Part III, Chapter 1, Section 3-2 (Response in Cyber Domain)

**1** The United States


**Chapter**


In the United States, the Department of Homeland Security

is responsible for protecting federal government networks

and critical infrastructure against cyber attacks, and the

Department’s Cybersecurity Infrastructure Security Agency

(CISA) works to protect the networks of government

agencies.

The U.S. NSS (December 2017) points out that many

countries now view cyber capabilities as tools for projecting

influence and that cyberattacks have become a key feature

of modern conflict. It also notes that the United States

would deter, defend, and when necessary defeat malicious

actors who inflict cyber attacks on the United States. The

U.S. DoD in its National Defense Strategy (January 2018)

described a policy of investing in cyber defense, resilience,


-----

capabilities to strengthen the functions for identifying and

analyzing cyberspace threats. In November 2016, the country

announced a new “Cyber Security Strategy” that presents a

vision for the United Kingdom, which is to be secure and

resilient to cyber threats, prosperous and confident in the

digital world. To achieve this vision, the Strategy requires the

United Kingdom to deter cyber threats by having effective

defensive and offensive means and to “develop” cutting-edge

technologies.

On the organizational front, in October 2016, the National

Cyber Security Centre (NCSC) was newly established under

the Government Communications Headquarters (GCHQ) to

promote public-private partnerships for responses to national

cyber incidents.

**4 Australia**


**2 North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO)**


The NATO Policy on Cyber Defence and its action plan,

which were adopted in June 2011: (1) clarify the political and

operational mechanisms of NATO’s response to cyber attacks;

(2) clarify that NATO would provide assistance to member

states to develop their cyber defense, and provide assistance

to member states if they are subject to cyber attacks; and (3)

set out principles on cooperation with partners. Furthermore,

at the NATO Summit in September 2014, an agreement was

reached that NATO’s collective defense applies to cyber

attacks against member states.

On the organizational front, in November 2017, an

agreement was reached on the creation of a new Cyber

Operations Center and the integration of NATO member

countries’ cyber defense capabilities into NATO missions

and operations. The Cyber Operations Center located in

Belgium is expected to be fully operational with cyber attack

capabilities by 2023. Furthermore, NATO has conducted

cyber defense training exercises annually since 2008 to

heighten cyber defense capabilities. In addition, NATO

has expanded cooperation with the EU in the fields of

cybersecurity and cyber defense.

In 2008, the NATO Cooperative Cyber Defence Centre of

Excellence (CCDCOE) was authorized to serve as a research

and training institution, and was established in Estonia’s

capital of Tallinn. CCDCOE carries out research on the

relationship between cyber activities and international law,

creating the “Tallinn Manual.” In February 2017, “Tallinn

Manual 2.0” was published as the second edition of the

previous manual based on a review of broad discussion

points, from peacetime legal regimes, such as laws on state

responsibility, human rights, aviation, space, and maritime

affairs, to contingency legal regimes, such as laws on armed

conflict. In December 2019, NATO held its “Cyber Coalition

2019” exercise, in which Japan officially participated for the

first time in addition to 27 NATO member countries and the

EU.

**Chapter**


In its first “National Security Strategy” published in January

2013, Australia positions integrated cyber policies and

operations as one of the top national security priorities. In

April 2016, a new “Cyber Security Strategy” through 2020

was released, which provides that Australia will ensure the

safety of the people, that private companies will participate

in cybersecurity, and that threat information will be shared.

On the organizational front, cybersecurity capabilities

across the government were converged to establish the

Australian Cyber Security Center (ACSC), which addresses

major cybersecurity issues related to government agencies

and critical infrastructure. In July 2015, the ACSC issued

its first report on cybersecurity, which contends that the

number, type, and sophistication of cyber threats to Australia

are all increasing. Moreover, the Australian Defence Force

created the Information Warfare Division under the Joint

Capabilities Group in July 2017 and established the Defence

Signals Intelligence and Cyber Command under the division

in January 2018. In October 2019, the Royal Australian

Air Force offered to recruit cyber skills officers to protect

networks, data and information systems.

military sectors in responding to cyber threats and to activate

relevant international cooperation. The ROK also formulated

its first “National Cybersecurity Strategy” in April 2019 to

protect the safety of the people and enhance national security,

and released the “National Cybersecurity Basic Plan” to

materialize the strategy in September 2019.

In the national defense sector, the Cyber Measures

Technology Team was established by the Ministry of

National Defense to respond to cyber and hacking threats.


The sector has also worked out procedures for quick response

to cyber crises under the “National Cyber Security Strategy”

and the “National Cybersecurity Crisis Response Manual.”

In 2015, the Joint Chiefs of Staff centralized the cyber attack

tactical system mainly around the Joint Chiefs of Staff by

newly establishing the Cyber Tactics Department, assigning

control authority concerning cyber tactics to the Chairman of

the Joint Chiefs of Staff, and issuing a field manual on “joint

cyber tactics.”

**Trends in Electromagnetic Domain**

**4**


**❶[ Electromagnetic Domain and Security]**

The electromagnetic spectrum is propagated by the

oscillations of electric and magnetic fi elds. In everyday life,

it is used for various purposes ranging from television and

mobile communications to geolocation information through

global positioning systems.

In the defense fi eld, the electromagnetic spectrum is used

for command and control communications equipment, radar

systems for detecting enemies, missile guidance systems, and

other equipment. Securing superiority in the electromagnetic

domain is indispensable for modern operations. Activities

using the electromagnetic domain include electronic warfare

and electromagnetic spectrum control. Electronic warfare

means or approaches are generally classifi ed into three –

electronic attack, electronic protection and electronic warfare

support.

See  Figure 1-3-4-1 (How to Use the Electromagnetic Domain in the

See

Defense Field)

“Electronic attacks” are designed to reduce or neutralize

adversary communications and search capabilities by

sending stronger radio waves or radio waves pretending to be

adversary waves aimed at an adversary’s communications and

radar equipment to jam waves coming from such equipment.

They include radio wave jamming, radio wave deception

and physical destruction using high-power electronic waves

(such as high-power laser and high-power microwaves).

See  Section 1-1 (3) of this Chapter (High-power Energy Technology)

“Electronic protection” makes equipment stealthy


or diffi cult to be detected by adversaries and reduces or

neutralizes adversary electronic attacks on communications

and radar equipment by changing electronic wave frequency

for use or increasing its power.

“Electronic warfare support” consists of activities designed

to collect information on adversary electromagnetic spectrum

for electronic warfare purposes. It is necessary for effective

electronic attacks or protection to detect and analyze what

electromagnetic spectrum is usually used by adversaries

for communications equipment, radar and electronic attack

aircraft. It is desirable to be able to conduct electronic

warfare effectively even if electromagnetic spectrum used

by adversaries is not detected or analyzed in advance. For

example, AI may be mounted on or used for equipment to

immediately analyze jamming and automatically select

frequency bands that are the most invulnerable to jamming.

“Electromagnetic spectrum control” means the control

and adjustment of electromagnetic spectrum use to facilitate

electromagnetic domain activities such as electronic attacks

and protection. Specifi c measures for the control include

the detection of how electromagnetic spectrum is used in a

theater of operation, as well as the adjustment of frequencies,

directions and durations of electromagnetic spectrum used

for friendly forces and equipment to avoid electromagnetic

spectrum interference. At present, research is being

conducted on technologies for detecting and visualizing how

electromagnetic spectrum is used.

cooperation with its allies under an initiative to aggressively

achieve its dominance in the electromagnetic domain.

Major U.S. electronic warfare units include the Navy’s 13

electronic attack squadrons armed with EA-18G electronic

warfare aircraft as well as Marine Corps flight squadrons

with electronic warfare aircraft. As an example of military

China has set an initiative to put cyber warfare and other

electronic elements, and physical destruction and other

non-electronic elements under unified control.[2] Under

the initiative, China conducts force-on-force exercises

on a routine basis to effectively accomplish missions in

complicated electromagnetic environments, improving

practical capabilities. It is pointed out that China’s armed

forces have taken advantage of such exercises to assess

electronic warfare weapon research and development

achievements.[3] The Strategic Support Force, established for

improving overall military operational capabilities, may be

responsible for such domains as electronic warfare, cyber

and space.

China’s TU-154 intelligence and Y-8 electronic warfare

aircraft have been seen flying around the Nansei Islands and

the Sea of Japan in the vicinity of Japan. It is also reported

that China has mounted electronic warfare pods for jamming

missions on J-15 fighters, H-6 bombers, and other aircraft,

and deployed a jamming system on Mischief Reef of the

Spratly Islands.[4] In a military parade to mark the 90th

anniversary of the Chinese People’s Liberation Army in July

2017, unmanned aircraft reported as mounted with electronic

warfare equipment were displayed.

Russia, in its Military Doctrine, positions electronic warfare

equipment as important equipment in modern military

conflict. It is noted that Russia used electronic warfare

equipment in the “Vostok 2018” exercise in September 2018,

the “Tsentr 2019” exercise in September 2019 and other

exercises. It is also pointed out that Russian forces have

positioned electronic warfare as part of offensive means and
improved practical electronic warfare capabilities in recent
years.[5]

Russia’s electronic warfare force reportedly has five

brigades led mainly by the Army.[6] It is reported that Russia

used various electronic warfare systems in eastern Ukraine

to block Ukrainian forces’ command and control traffic and

jam GPS waves to interrupt their drone operations, affecting

Ukraine’s military performance.[7] It is also reported that

Russia used Krasukha-4 and other electronic warfare systems

of the COVID-19 infection, China is continuously trying
to change the status quo in the East China Sea unilaterally
by coercion. Chinese Navy vessels regularly carry out
activities and Chinese government vessels repeatedly intrude
into Japanese territorial waters around the Senkaku Islands
despite protests by the Japanese government. In May 2020,
there was an incident in which a Chinese government vessel
came close to a Japanese fi shing boat and followed it in the
territorial waters. Additionally, the number of scrambles by
the Air Self-Defense Force (ASDF) against Chinese aircraft
has remained at a high level. In the South China Sea, it is said
that Chinese fl eets including Aircraft Carrier “Liaoning,”
which passed through the waters between the mainland
of Okinawa and Miyakojima Island to the Pacifi c Ocean,
proceeded to the South China Sea through the Bashi Channel
and conducted training in April 2020. In the same month,
it was announced that the State Council of the People’s
Republic of China approved the establishment of two new
districts, the Xisha District governing the Xisha Islands and
surrounding waters, and the Nansha District governing the
Nansha Islands and surrounding waters, under the Sansha
City of Hainan Province, which China had established in the
South China Sea. In this manner, China has been trying to
unilaterally change the status quo in the South China Sea,
employing means beyond military tactics, and create a fait
accompli. Such moves of China are triggering protests from
surrounding countries, which are now struggling to counter
the COVID-19 infection.
In the United States, since mid-March, in order to
respond to the increase in the number of people infected
with COVID-19, states, District of Columbia, and other
territories mobilized their National Guards and had them
engage in duties including transportation of medical goods,
epidemic prevention and medical assistance. The federal
troops also supported medical activities in the country by
dispatching a hospital ship and operating fi eld hospitals. The
DoD (including the U.S. Forces) has been taking measures to
prevent a further spread of infection within the department,
such as restricting offi cials’ moves in and out of the country,
ensuring social distancing and wearing of masks, and
introducing remote work. In addition, in order to prevent
the spread of infection through military exchanges with
other countries, the U.S. Forces has been taking measures to
postpone, scale down, and cancel joint exercises with other
countries. This includes postponing the ROK-US Combined
Forces Command Exercise, and scaling down U.S.-led
multilateral joint exercises in Europe.
In the meantime, cases of the spread of infection in U.S.
troops deployed overseas, in particular within naval vessels,
have been reported. The infection was confi rmed among crew


members of aircraft carrier Theodore Roosevelt and other
vessels. Under such circumstances, Secretary of Defense
Esper and other senior military offi cers, alleging that an
enemy is trying to take advantage of this opportunity when
the U.S. Forces are coping with the COVID-19 infection,
emphasize the signifi cance of maintaining the readiness to
take quick actions, and have reiterated that the infection does
not affect the readiness and ability to conduce to national
security missions of the U.S. Forces as a whole.
North Korea repeatedly publicized that there is no one in
North Korea who is infected with COVID-19, but is said to
have been taking measures to prevent infection by closing
borders with China, suspending services of international
fl ights and cross-border railway connections, and restricting
moves of foreigners and residents. North Korea might be
suffering economic losses. In March 2020, General Abrams,
Commander of United States Forces Korea, mentioned that he
was confi dent that there are people infected with COVID-19
in North Korea, and stated that the North Korean Forces
were on lockdown for about 30 days and regular training
was just resumed recently. In March, North Korea repeated
launches of ballistic missiles four times, and seems to be
making efforts to enhance missile-related technologies and
operational capability, but some point out that the intention
of the regime is to tighten internal control and externally
demonstrate the maintenance of its leadership and military
force in the face of the global spread of COVID-19.
In ROK, Minister of National Defense Jeong Kyeongdoo instructed in February 2020 to input all resources
for countering the COVID-19 infection, referring to the
current situation as being equivalent to wartime. Under
such instruction, the ROK Forces offer support in the fi elds
of epidemic prevention and transportation. For enhancing
effi ciencies and accelerating countermeasures, the National
Defense Prompt Support Unit was organized in March
2020. In the meantime, fi eld training was all suspended
nationwide in February, and troops under fi eld training were
provided with guidance to return to their bases immediately.
COVID-19 thus exerted infl uence on military activities.
In February 2020, Russia dispatched aircraft of the
Russian Aerospace Forces to China to transport its people
back to Russia, and has carried out support activities such
as transportation of medical relief goods for other countries
since March. Within the country, a countermeasures
headquarters was established in the Russian Forces and 49
sanitation and infection units were newly organized to take
thorough countermeasures. However, in April for the fi rst
time, the Ministry of Defence of the Russian Federation
announced the infection case found in the Russian Forces,
and the number of infected personnel is increasing. Efforts


**Chapter**


-----

have been made to increase the number of hospital beds with
the aim of also offering medical support to the private sector,
such as increasing the number of beds of the hospital ship
held by the Pacific Fleet and newly constructing 16 medical
centers nationwide. Although President Putin announced the
postponement of the military parade, which was scheduled in
May 2020, until sometime within the year, drills and training
of the Russian Forces seem to be carried out as usual, and
active military activities have been confirmed, including
launching tests of antisatellite missiles and a near-midair
collision with U.S. aircraft above the Mediterranean Sea.
Also around Japan, Russian aircraft continue proximate
flights, and it was reported that the Pacific Fleet conducted
a military exercise in the waters including sea areas near the
Northern Territories in April 2020.
In countries in Europe, where the infection spread rapidly,
military forces are used for countermeasures, such as the
establishment of field hospitals, transportation of medical
personnel, patients and medical supplies, and assistance
with private hospitals by military medical personnel. For
example, the U.K. Forces supply logistics and help with
the construction of new hospitals, the French Forces offer


support at field hospitals and transport patients using their
aircraft, and the German Forces transport patients with
severe symptoms. In France, it was confirmed in April 2020
that crew members of Aircraft Carrier “Charles de Gaulle”
were infected with COVID-19.
In this manner, the spread of the COVID-19 infection
has not only significantly affected global socioeconomic
activities, but has also had influences on the military activities
of respective countries. If the spread of infection is further
prolonged, this may exert various impacts on countries’
military capability. Furthermore, it is said that while actively
dispatching medical experts and providing medical goods to
countries where the infection is spreading, China has been
making propaganda efforts in various manners, including the
spread of false information, amid growing social uncertainties
and confusion due to the spread of infection. The COVID-19
pandemic may expose and intensify strategic competition
among countries intending to create international and
regional orders more preferable to themselves and to expand
their influence. We need to closely watch such moves with
great concern as security issues.

**6** **Maritime Trends**


Japan is a maritime nation surrounded by sea and depends

on maritime transportation for importing energy resources.

In this sense, securing maritime traffi c safety is vital for the

nation’s existence. At the same time, ensuring the stable

use of the maritime domain as infrastructure supporting

international logistics is recognized as a primary concern for

the international community.


Nevertheless, some countries unilaterally claim their

rights or take actions based on their own assertions that are

incompatible with the existing international order, leading

the principle of the freedom of the high seas to be violated

unduly. Attacks on ships in the Middle East and piracy seen

at various locations have become a threat to maritime traffi c.

denied in the arbitration award between the Philippines and

China and the illegality of China’s reclamation activities

was acknowledged. However, China has clearly stated its

intention not to comply with the award and has continued

the militarization of the features by developing military

facilities such as batteries and various infrastructure that

can be used for military purposes, such as runways, harbors,

hangars and radar facilities. Moreover, in July and August

2016 after the arbitration award between the Philippines

and China was rendered, an H-6K bomber of the PLA

Air Force (PLAAF) conducted combat air patrols in the

airspace around Scarborough Shoal, with China’s Ministry

of National Defense announcing that it would conduct

these patrols regularly from now on. This shows the PLA

has been intensifying its operations in the South China Sea.

Under these circumstances, a further increase in China’s

aerial presence in the area could lead to the establishment

of a “South China Sea Air Defense Identification Zone” in

the future.

Furthermore, Chinese government vessels have obstructed

fishing and other vessels of other countries approaching the

features by firing warning shots and water cannons at the

vessels. Claimants as well as the international community

including the United States have repeatedly expressed their

deep concerns over such conducts.

In a dangerous act that could cause unintended

consequences, PLA Navy and other ships approached and

obstructed a U.S. Navy ship sailing in the South China Sea

in September 2018.

（3）Unintended Contingency Avoidance Initiatives

Despite these numerous acts that could pose risks to securing

the stable use of oceans and airspace, in recent years progress


has been made in efforts to avert and prevent unintended

consequences in the seas and skies. First, at the Japan-China

Summit Meeting held on May 9, 2018, Japan and China

agreed to establish a “Maritime and Aerial Communication

Mechanism between the Defense Authorities of Japan and

China” with the aim of avoiding unintended confrontations

between the naval vessels and aircraft of the SDF and PLA.

The mechanism went into operation in June of the same year.

As for multi-national initiatives, in April 2014, navies

of participating countries of the Western Pacific Naval

Symposium (WPNS), including Japan, the United States,

and China, adopted the Code for Unplanned Encounters at

Sea (CUES).[2] CUES sets forth a code of conduct such as

procedures and communication method to ensure safety for

unexpected encounters by vessels or aircraft of the navies of

these countries. In November 2014, the United States and

China agreed on measures pertaining to mutual notification

of military activities, together with rules of behavior to avert

collisions in waters and airspace in accordance with CUES

and other frameworks. In September 2015, the two countries

announced an agreement concerning an additional annex

stipulating rules of behavior to avert air encounters. Between

ASEAN and China, official discussions have been held for

the establishment of the Code of the Conduct of Parties in the

South China Sea (COC).

It is strongly hoped that these initiatives designed to avert

and prevent unintended consequences in the seas and skies

will supplement the existing international order and that the

countries concerned, including China, refrain from unilateral

actions that add to tension and act on the basis of the principle

of the rule of law.

In the Strait of Hormuz and its vicinity, attacks on private

to secure safe navigation.

sporadic attacks on military and commercial ships have been

seen in waters such as those off Yemen and the Strait of Bab

-----

In addition, some countries have conducted their exclusive

operations outside the abovementioned frameworks. Since

December 2008, for example, China has deployed naval

vessels for counterpiracy operations in waters off the coast

of Somalia and in the Gulf of Aden.

While the number of piracy incidents in waters off the

coast of Somalia and in the Gulf of Aden has remained low

thanks primarily to such international initiatives, Somalia’s

unstable security and poverty as fundamental factors behind

piracy have not been resolved.

Meanwhile, in Africa, piracy incidents occurred in the

Gulf of Guinea (the number of incidents was 64 in 2019).

The international community has continued counterpiracy

initiatives in this region.

The number of piracy incidents in Southeast Asian

waters came to 53 in 2019. Traditionally, maritime armed

robbery incidents, including the theft of cash, crewmembers’

belongings, ship equipment and other items, have accounted

for most of piracy incidents in the waters. In recent

years, however, they included grave incidents in which

crewmembers were kidnapped for ransom purposes in the

Sulu Sea and the Celebes Sea off the Philippines.

Counterpiracy measures in Asia include international

information sharing and cooperation based on the Regional

Cooperation Agreement on Combating Piracy and Armed

Robbery against Ships in Asia (ReCAAP),[5] which was

worked out at Japan’s initiative and put into force in 2006.

In addition, Indonesia, Malaysia, Singapore, and Thailand

conduct the Malacca Strait Patrols.[6] The cases of abduction

for ransom have been confirmed in the Sulu Sea and the

Celebes Sea. In order to respond to this, Indonesia, Malaysia

and the Philippines began sea patrols in the area in June 2017

and air patrols in October of the same year.


（2）Piracy

Piracy seen at various locations has become a threat to

maritime traffic. The number of maritime piracy and armed

robbery incidents (hereinafter referred to as piracy incidents)

in the world[3] came to a peak of 445 in 2010, followed by

439 in 2011, and 297 in 2012, indicating a downtrend (the

number stood at 162 in 2019). The decline has depended

heavily on the fall in the number of piracy incidents in waters

off the coast of Somalia and in the Gulf of Aden.

The number of piracy incidents in waters off the coast

of Somalia and in the Gulf of Aden rose rapidly from 2008

to 218 in 2009, 219 in 2010, and 237 in 2011, following a

persistent uptrend, accounting for more than a half of the

global total and attracting great international concern as a

threat to safe navigation. In the recent years, however, the

number of piracy incidents in waters off the coast of Somalia

and in the Gulf of Aden has remained low as a result of

various initiatives taken by the international community

including Japan (the number stood at zero in 2019; see Part

III for Japan’s initiatives).

The international counterpiracy initiatives in waters

off the coast of Somalia and in the Gulf of Aden include

counterpiracy operations by the Combined Task Force 151

(CTF151), a multinational force that was created in January

2009 by the U.S. Force-led Combined Maritime Force

(CMF)[4] based in Bahrain. So far, the United States, Australia,

the United Kingdom, Turkey, the ROK, Pakistan and other

countries have participated in the CTF151, conducting zone

defense operations to counter piracy. The EU for its part

has conducted Operation Atalanta to counter piracy since

December 2008. In the operation, naval vessels and aircraft

dispatched by EU member countries escort ships and monitor

the waters off the coast of Somalia. It has been decided that

the operation will continue until the end of 2020.


**Chapter**


The numbers of piracy incidents cited in the main text are based on a report by the International Maritime Bureau of the International Chamber of Commerce.

The CMF is a multinational force, which operates to promote maritime security, stability, and prosperity, under the U.S. Central Command. Forces from 32 countries participate in the CMF,
and the Commander of the U.S. Fifth Fleet concurrently serves as the CMF Commander. The CMF is comprised of three combined task forces: Combined Task Force 150 (CTF-150), which
is tasked with maritime security operations; Combined Task Force 151 (CTF-151) with counter-piracy operations; and Combined Task Force 152 (CTF-152) with maritime security
operations in the Persian Gulf. The SDF deploy units to CTF-151.

The contracting parties to ReCAAP are the following 20 countries: Australia; Bangladesh; Brunei; Cambodia; China; Denmark; India; Japan; the ROK; Laos; Myanmar; the Netherlands;
Norway; the Philippines; Singapore; Sri Lanka; Thailand; the United Kingdom; the United States; and Vietnam.

The Malacca Strait Patrols are comprised of: the Malacca Strait Sea Patrols which commenced in 2004; aircraft patrol activities which commenced in 2005; and information sharing

**❸ [Trends in the Arctic Ocean]**

The area north of latitude 66 degrees 33 minutes is called

the Arctic Region. The Arctic Region includes Canada,

Denmark, Finland, Iceland, Norway, Russia, Sweden and

the United States. These eight are called Arctic countries. In

1996, the Arctic countries established the Arctic Council to

promote cooperation in their common challenges, including

sustainable development and environmental protection in the

Arctic Region.

In recent years, moves towards the utilization of trans
Arctic navigation routes and the development of natural

resources in the Arctic Ocean have gained momentum in line

with a decline in sea ice. From the perspective of security, the

Arctic Ocean has traditionally been used for the deployment

of strategic nuclear forces and as their transit route. With the

decrease in sea ice in recent years, ships have been able to

navigate for a longer period of time and more extensively

than before. It is therefore considered that the region could be

used for deploying maritime forces or maneuvering military

forces in the future. In this situation, moves to deploy new

military capabilities in the ocean are seen.

In the Russian Federation’s National Security Strategy

revised in December 2015, Russia continues to maintain that

it would secure its interests in resource development and use

of the sea route.

Russia has been developing natural gas on the Yamal

Peninsula. In 2018, liquefied natural gas produced on the

peninsula was transported to China for the first time via an

Arctic Ocean route. As for military arrangements, Russia has

set up a joint strategic command for each of the four military

districts to unify all of ground, maritime, air and other

forces. In 2014, Russia created the Northern Joint Strategic

Command reportedly to integrate the Northern Fleet with

ground and air forces and cover waters, remote islands


and the Arctic coast between the Barents Sea and the East

Siberian Sea. In the Arctic Region, Russia is constructing 10

airfields. As for military operations, the Northern Fleet has

annually conducted a long-distance navigation to the Novo

Sibirski Islands since 2012. Russia has intensified other

Arctic military operations including SSBN submarines’

strategic nuclear deterrence patrols and long-range bombers’

patrol flights.

In its Arctic Strategy published June in 2019, the U.S.

DoD expressed concern against actions of China and Russia

in the Arctic region[7] and a desire for the Arctic to become

a secure and stable region where U.S. national interests are

safeguarded, the U.S. homeland is protected, and nations

work cooperatively to address challenges.[8] The United States

reportedly plans to increase the number of U.S. Marines in

Norway on a rotation basis from about 300 to about 700

from 2017. In October 2018, it sent an aircraft carrier to the

Arctic Region for the first time in 27 years for air drills in

the Norwegian Sea ahead of the NATO exercise “Trident

Juncture 2018”. In December 2016, then U.S. President

Obama decided to ban new drilling for oil and natural

gas in a majority of U.S. territorial waters in the Arctic to

protect marine resources, showing a negative stance towards

resource development. However, President Trump signed an

executive order repealing this decision of then U.S. President

Obama in April 2017.

Aside from coastal states in the Arctic Ocean, 13 countries

including Japan, China, the ROK, the United Kingdom,

Germany and France, have observer status in the Arctic

Council. Notably, China has shown active involvement in the

Arctic Ocean, deploying the polar research vessel Xue Long

to the Arctic Ocean for 10 times since 1999.[9] In January

2018, they published a white paper titled “China’s Arctic


**Chapter**


As for Russia, the U.S. DoD pointed out in its Arctic Strategy that Russia is strengthening its presence above the Arctic Circle by deploying Arctic units and establishing new military bases.
Moreover, Russia has reportedly threatened to use force against vessels that fail to abide by Russian regulations. The DoD pointed out that Russia could utilize its military capabilities in an
effort to deny access to disputed Arctic waters or resources. As for China, the DoD pointed out in its strategy that its operations of icebreaking vessels and civilian research activities could
support a future Chinese military presence in the Arctic Ocean including deployment of submarines to the region, and also pointed out that it was attempting to gain a role in the Arctic in
ways that may undermine international rules and norms, and there is a risk that its predatory economic behavior globally may be repeated in the Arctic. In May 2019, during his visit to
Finland, Secretary of State Pompeo made a speech concerning Arctic policy, in which he stated that all relevant parties should follow the same rules and expressed caution against efforts
by China and Russia to expand into the Arctic region.

In August 2019, U.S. President Trump stated that buying Denmark’s autonomous territory Greenland was “strategically interesting.” In response, Danish Prime Minister Mette Frederiksen
described the Trump statement as “absurd” and the Greenland government issued a statement noting that Greenland was not for sale. President Trump countered that he would postpone
his visit to Denmark as the prime minister was not willing to discuss any Greenland deal.

In 2012, Xue Long became the first polar research vessel to sail across the Arctic Ocean. In 2013, the cargo freighter Yong Sheng became the first Chinese commercial ship to cross the
Arctic Ocean. Canadian scientists took part in Xue Long’s voyage to the Arctic Ocean in 2017, and they succeeded for the first time in trial navigation of the Arctic Northwest Passage (along

it was reported for the first time that five Chinese naval

**Transfer and Proliferation of Weapons of Mass Destruction (WMDs)**

**7**


The transfer and proliferation of WMDs, such as nuclear,
biological and chemical (NBC) weapons, and ballistic
missiles that deliver such weapons, have been recognized as a
signifi cant threat since the end of the Cold War. In particular,

**❶ [Nuclear Weapons ]**

During the Cold War, the Cuban Missile Crisis of 1962
raised awareness of the danger of a full-scale nuclear war
between the United States and the Soviet Union. The Treaty
on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons (NPT) that
took effect in 1970 prohibited countries, other than those that
exploded a nuclear weapon or other nuclear explosive device
in or before 1966 (the United States, the then Soviet Union,
the United Kingdom, as well as France and China, which
acceded to the NPT in 1992), from having nuclear weapons,
and provided that arms control and disarmament of nuclear
forces would be pursued through two-way negotiations.

As of January 2020, the NPT had been signed by 191
countries and regions. While some countries that had
previously possessed nuclear weapons became signatories to
this treaty as non-nuclear weapon states by abandoning these
weapons, India, Israel, and Pakistan still refuse to accede to
this treaty as non-nuclear weapon states. Meanwhile, North
Korea has conducted six nuclear tests and declared the
development and possession of nuclear weapons.

The U.S.-Russia New Strategic Arms Reduction Treaty is set

**KEY WORD** New Strategic Arms Reduction Treaty (New START)

there still remain strong concerns that non-state actors,
including terrorists, against which traditional deterrence
works less effectively, could acquire and use WMDs.

to expire in February 2021 or be extended for up to fi ve years

if agreed between the countries. While Russia has proposed

an early extension, the United States has not specifi ed its

stance on the matter. The treaty’s future course, including its

extension, is still uncertain. The United States has indicated

its hope to pursue an arms control framework including

China. However, China, which is deemed to have increased

its inventory of nuclear warheads as well as developed and

deployed their means of delivery[1] and continued to enhance

the capability of its nuclear force, has reiterated that it has

no intention to participate in any U.S.-Russian arms control

framework. In the future, it may be important to launch

some international arms control and disarmament initiative

including not only the United States and Russia but also

China and others. Future trends regarding nuclear arms

control and disarmament should be closely watched.

the number of deployed strategic nuclear warheads for the United States was 1,373 and the delivery vehicles involved 655 missiles/aircraft; the number of deployed strategic
nuclear warheads for Russia was 1,326 and the delivery vehicles involved 485 missiles/aircraft. However, according to the SIPRI Yearbook 2019, as of January 2019, the number
of deployed U.S. nuclear warheads was approx. 1,750 (including 150 tactical nuclear warheads) and that of Russian ones was approx. 1,600.
3. In November 2015, the U.K.’s Strategic Defence and Security Review (SDSR) stipulated that the number of deployed nuclear warheads is to be no more than 120, while the
number of nuclear warheads possessed is to be no more than 180.
4. According to the SIPRI Yearbook 2019, India possesses 130-140 nuclear warheads, Pakistan 150-160, Israel 80-90, and North Korea 20-30.

**❷ [Biological and Chemical Weapons ]**

Biological and chemical weapons are easy to manufacture at

relatively low cost and are easy to disguise as most materials,
equipment, and technology needed to manufacture these
weapons can be used for both military and civilian purposes.
These weapons are attractive to states and non-state actors,
such as terrorists, seeking asymmetric means of attack.[2]

Biological weapons have the following characteristics: (1)
manufacturing is easy and inexpensive; (2) there is usually
an incubation period of a few days between exposure and
onset; (3) their use is hard to detect; (4) even the threat of use
can create great psychological effects; and (5) they can cause
mass casualties and injuries depending on the circumstances
of use and the type of weapon. As has been pointed out,
advancements in life science could be misused or abused for
the development of biological weapons.
The United States, United Kingdom, and France launched
missile strikes on chemical weapons-related facilities in


Syria in April 2018, determining that its Assad regime had
used chemical weapons in Eastern Ghouta.[3 ] North Korea
is an example of an actor that is still presumed to possess
these chemical weapons and has not entered into the
Chemical Weapons Convention (CWC). In addition, such
incidents as the Tokyo subway sarin attack in 1995 showed
that the threat of the use of WMDs by terrorists is real and
that these weapons could cause serious damage if used in
cities. The United Kingdom criticized Russia over its highly
likely involvement in the use of Novichok, a military-grade
chemical weapon developed by Russia, in the attack on a
former Russian intelligence agent that occurred in the United
Kingdom in March 2018. In retaliation, countries including
European countries and the United States expelled Russian
diplomats. In September 2018, the United Kingdom released
its joint statement with the United States, France, and
Germany, emphasizing Russia’s involvement in the attack

**❸ [Ballistic Missiles and Other Missiles ]**

Ballistic missiles are propelled by rockets for parabolic flights
and are capable of attacking distant targets. They can be used
as a means of delivering WMDs, such as NBC weapons. As
they fall at a steep angle and high speed, highly accurate
systems are required for intercepting them effectively.

Fig. I-3-7-2 (Ballistic missiles)

The deployment of ballistic missiles in a region where an
armed conflict is under way runs the risk of intensifying or
expanding the conflict. Additionally, it has the risk of further
heightening tension in a region where military confrontation
is ongoing, leading to the destabilization of that region.
Furthermore, ballistic missiles are used as a means of
attacking from a distance or threatening another country that
has superior conventional forces.
In recent years, along with the threat of ballistic missiles,
analysts have pointed to the threat of cruise missiles as
a weapon which is comparatively easy for terrorists and
other non-state actors to acquire and has the potential for
proliferation. Because cruise missiles are cheaper to produce


Russian Administration and that the attack could have been
approved by top Russian government officials.

- 

compared to ballistic missiles and are easy to maintain and
train with, many countries either produce or modify cruise
missiles. At the same time, it is said that cruise missiles have
a higher degree of target accuracy and that they are difficult
to detect while in flight. Moreover, because they are smaller
than ballistic missiles, cruise missiles can be concealed on a
ship to secretly approach a target and present a serious threat
if they carry WMDs in their warheads.


|Fig. I-3-7-2 Classification of B|Ballistic Missiles|
|---|---|
|Description|Range|
|Short Range Ballistic Missile, SRBM|Under approx. 1,000 km or less|
|Medium Range Ballistic Missile, MRBM|Approx. 1,000 to under approx. 3,000 km|
|Intermediate Range Ballistic Missile, IRBM|Approx. 3,000 to under approx. 5,500 km|
|Inter-Continental Ballistic Missile, ICBM|Approx. 5,500 km or more|


＊Ballistic missiles launched from submarines are collectively referred to as submarine-launched ballistic 

missiles (SLBMs), while a ballistic missile that has a precision guidance system on its warhead necessary

to attack aircraft carriers and other vessels is called an anti-ship ballistic missile (ASBM).

defense purposes could easily be exported or transferred once the acquisition and use of WMDs by terrorists and other nondomestic manufacturing becomes successful. For example, state actors.

Korea s Nodong missiles. Furthermore, North Korea is
alleged to have provided conventional arms and ballistic
missiles to the Houthis of Yemen, have sent ballistic missile
engineers to Syria, have transferred special tiles used for
chemical weapon production facilities to Syria, and have
continued military relations with Myanmar, including
ballistic missile system trade.[5]

North Korea made rapid strides in the development of its
ballistic missiles with only a few test launches in the 1980s
and 1990s. It is believed that an underlying factor behind
this fact was North Korea’s imports of various materials and
technologies from outside of North Korea. It is also noted
that North Korea transfers ballistic missile airframes and
related technologies and promotes the further development
of missiles using funds procured through such transfer.[6]
The international community’s uncompromising and
decisive stance against the transfer and proliferation of


WMDs and other technologies has put significant pressure
on countries engaged in related activities, leading some of
them to accept inspections by international organizations
or abandon their WMD and other programs altogether.
Meanwhile, it is pointed out that, in recent years, states
in which transferring is a concern have sustained their
external transfer while averting international monitoring
by falsifying documentation, diversifying transport routes,
and utilizing multiple front companies and intermediaries to
illicitly export WMDs. Additionally, intangible technology
transfer has arisen as a cause for concern. Namely, those
states have obtained advanced technologies which could be
adapted for the development and manufacturing of WMDs
and other technologies via their nationals—researchers and
students who have been dispatched to leading companies and
academic institutions in developed countries.

**Section** **Trends in International Terrorism**

**❶** **[General Situation]**

Confl icts or disputes concerning racial, religious, territorial,

resources and other issues are occurring or continuing

in various places in the world. Human rights violations,

refugees, famine, poverty, or any other consequences of

confl icts or disputes can have impacts on not only parties

to the confl icts or disputes but also a wide range of other

countries.
There are prominent cases where power vacuums in
some countries with political instability or weak governance
have become a hotbed for activities of international terrorist
organizations, such as Al Qaeda and Islamic State in Iraq
and the Levant (ISIL). These organizations are leveraging
inadequate border control to obtain personnel, weapons
and funds, and to send fi ghters to various places to carry
out organized terrorist attacks or give some instructions to
local individuals or groups, expanding and stepping up their
operations across national borders. In recent years, they have
also been spreading their violent extremist ideologies through
the Internet and other means across the world. As a result,
there were cases where young people in Western and other
developed countries felt sympathy for the violent radical
beliefs due to their social discontent, participating as fi ghters
in international terrorist groups and carrying out terrorist
attacks in their home countries. Terrorist organizations such
as ISIL and Al Qaeda have propagated practical tactics
of terrorism through their journals and other media and
encourage their supporters to implement them. Under the


circumstances, what is called “home-grown” terrorism, in
which residents are inspired by violent extremism spread by
terrorist organizations to conduct terrorist attacks at home,
remains a threat. In recent years, particularly, “lone-wolf”
terrorist attacks, planned and committed by individuals
or groups who have no offi cial relations with international
terrorist organizations but have become infl uenced by them
in some ways, have occurred in Western and other countries.
The characteristics of “lone-wolf” terrorism include that it
uses items that are relatively easy for individuals to obtain,
such as knives, vehicles, and guns, and that it is diffi cult
to detect signs of planned attacks and prevent them from
happening.
In March 2019, an unprecedented incident occurred in
Christchurch, New Zealand, where the perpetrator of a
terrorist attack (a shooting) live-streamed the crime on social
media and the footage was instantaneously disseminated.
Concerning international counterterrorism measures,
international cooperation has grown even more important
as terrorism threats have diffused and deepened on the
diversifi cation of terrorist attacks and the improvement of
terrorist groups’ attack capabilities. Currently, countries
are cooperating not only in military measures but also in
initiatives in various other fi elds to cut off funding sources
for terrorist organizations and prevent the international
movement of terrorists and the diffusion of violent radical
beliefs.

support from the United States and other countries, the Iraqi
Security Forces and local forces in Iraq and Syria proceeded to
recapture ISIL’s strongholds. In March 2019, U.S. President
Trump declared in a statement that the United States and
coalition forces had liberated 100% of ISIL-controlled areas
in Syria and Iraq. Meanwhile, with the support from Russia,
the Assad administration conquered ISIL strongholds mainly
in southern and eastern Syria. In December 2017, Russia
declared that Syria’s entire territory had been liberated from
ISIL. In October 2019, the United States announced that it
had killed ISIL’s leader Baghdadi in northwestern Syria.
While anti-ISIL military operations have made progress,
it is pointed out that about 11,000 ISIL fi ghters remain in
hiding in Iraq and Syria.[3] In this regard, terrorist attacks
believed to be conducted by ISIL are occurring in various
regions of Iraq and Syria, targeting security forces, the
Coalition forces, citizens and others, indicating that ISIL
remains still active. In Syria, in particular, it is pointed out
that ISIL may regain strength by exploiting the drawdown


of some U.S. forces in northeastern Syria and the launch
of Turkish military operations against Kurdish forces in
October 2019 to reconstitute its capabilities and resources in
Syria and strengthen its ability to plan attacks abroad.[4]

Meanwhile, after ISIL declared the establishment of the
“Islamic State,” multiple “provinces” have been established
outside of Iraq and Syria as the “Islamic State” territories,
and these “provinces” have been conducting terrorist acts in
various places.

States points out that the terrorist attacks may have been
inspired by ISIL. As ISIL is spreading violent extremist
ideologies through social media and other means, there are
concerns that the threat is spreading to South Asia and other
areas.
In addition, there continues to be a concern in Western
countries that foreign fighters entering Iraq and Syria will
return to their home countries to carry out a terrorist act after
receiving combat training and gaining combat experience in
the countries. Terrorist attacks in which ISIL fighters with


fighting experience in Syria have allegedly engaged have
taken place in Europe, including simultaneous attacks in
Paris in November 2015 and serial bombings in Belgium in
March 2016. Western countries have begun to accept some
of these foreign fighters following Turkey’s announcement in
November 2019 that it would repatriate as many as the 1,200
ISIL fighters it had detained. The international community
will need to continue various efforts to prevent terrorism by
foreign fighters.

**❶ [Constitution and the Right of Self-Defense]**

Since the end of World War II, Japan made a decision not
to repeat the ravages of war and has worked hard to build
a peace-loving nation. The Japanese people desire lasting
peace, and the principle of pacifi sm is enshrined in the
Constitution, Article 9 of which prescribes the renunciation
of war, the prohibition of war potential, and the denial of the
right of belligerency of the state. Of course, since Japan is
an independent nation, these provisions do not deny Japan’s


inherent right of self-defense as a sovereign state. Thus, the
Japanese Government interprets this as a constitutional right
to possess the minimum armed forces needed to exercise that
right. Therefore, Japan, under the Constitution, maintains
the Self-Defense Forces (SDF) as an armed organization,

strategy of defense, and continues to keep it equipped and
ready for operations.

-----

happiness is fundamentally overturned due to an armed
attack by a foreign country, and for safeguarding these rights
of the people. Hence, “use of force” to the minimum extent
necessary to that end is permitted. This is the basis, or the
so-called basic logic, of the view consistently expressed
by the government to date with regard to “use of force”
exceptionally permitted under Article 9 of the Constitution,
and clearly shown in the document “Relationship between
the Right of Collective Self-Defense and the Constitution”
submitted by the Government to the Committee on Audit of
the House of Councillors on October 14, 1972.
This basic logic must be maintained under Article 9 of the
Constitution.
To date, the Government has considered that “use of
force” under this basic logic is permitted only when an
“armed attack” against Japan occurs. However, in light of
the situation in which the security environment surrounding
Japan has been fundamentally transformed and continuously
evolving by shifts in the global power balance, the rapid
progress of technological innovation, and threats such as
weapons of mass destruction, etc., in the future, even an
armed attack occurring against a foreign country could
actually threaten Japan’s survival, depending on its purpose,
scale and manner, etc.
Japan, as a matter of course, will make the utmost
diplomatic efforts, should a dispute occur, for its peaceful
settlement and take all necessary responses in accordance
with the existing domestic laws and regulations developed
based upon the constitutional interpretation to date. It is still
required, however, to make all necessary preparations in
order to ensure Japan’s survival and protect its people.
Under such recognition and as a result of careful
examination in light of the current security environment,
it has been concluded that not only when an armed attack
against Japan occurs but also when an armed attack against
a foreign country that is in a close relationship with Japan
occurs and as a result threatens Japan’s survival and poses
a clear danger to fundamentally overturn people’s right to
life, liberty and pursuit of happiness, and when there is no
other appropriate means available to repel the attack and
ensure Japan’s survival and protect its people, use of force
to the minimum extent necessary should be interpreted to be
permitted under the Constitution as measures for self-defense
in accordance with the basic logic of the Government’s view
to date.
As a matter of course, Japan’s “use of force” must be
carried out while observing international law. At the same
time, a legal basis in international law and constitutional
interpretation need to be understood separately. In certain
situations, the aforementioned “use of force” permitted under


the Constitution is, under international law, based on the
right of collective self-defense. The Government has reached
a conclusion that although this “use of force” includes those
which are triggered by an armed attack occurring against a
foreign country, they are permitted under the Constitution,
only when they are taken as measures for self-defense which
are inevitable for ensuring Japan’s survival and protecting its
people, in other words, for defending Japan.

**3 Geographic Boundaries within Which the Right of**
Self-Defense May Be Exercised


**Chapter**


The use of the minimum necessary force to defend Japan
under the right of self-defense is not necessarily confined to
the geographic boundaries of Japanese territory, territorial
waters, and airspace. However, it is difficult to give a general
definition of the actual extent to which it may be used, as this
would vary with the situation.
Nevertheless, the Government interprets that, as a general
rule, the Constitution does not permit armed troops to be
dispatched to the land, sea, or airspace of other countries with
the aim of using force; such overseas deployment of troops
would exceed the definition of the minimum necessary level
of self-defense.

**4 Right of Belligerency**


Article 9, Paragraph 2 of the Constitution prescribes that “the
right of belligerency of the state will not be recognized.”
However, the “right of belligerency” does not mean the right
to engage in battle; rather, it is a general term for various
rights that a belligerent nation has under international law,
including the authority to inflict casualties and damage upon
the enemy’s military force and to occupy enemy territory.
On the other hand, Japan may of course use the minimum
level of force necessary to defend itself. For example, if
Japan inflicts casualties and damage upon the enemy’s
military force in exercising its right of self-defense, this is
conceptually distinguished from the exercise of the right of
belligerency, even though those actions do not appear to be
different. Occupation of enemy territory, however, would
exceed the minimum necessary level of self-defense and is
not permissible.


-----

**❸** **[Basic Policy]**

Under the Constitution, Japan has efficiently built a highly
effective and joint defense force in line with the basic
principles of maintaining an exclusively defense-oriented
policy and not becoming a military power that poses a threat
to other countries, while firmly maintaining the Japan-U.S.
Security Arrangements and adhering to the principle of
civilian control of the military, observing the Three NonNuclear Principles.

**1 Exclusively Defense-Oriented Policy**


**4 Securing Civilian Control**

Civilian control refers to the priority of politics to the
military in a democratic state or democratic political control
of military strength. Japan has, by giving serious reflection
to the regrettable state of affairs that happened until the
end of World War II, adopted the following strict civilian
control system that is entirely different from the one under
the former Constitution.[3] Civilian control aims to ensure that
the SDF is maintained and operated in accordance with the
will of the people.
The Diet, which represents Japanese nationals, makes
legislative and budgetary decisions on such matters
as the allotted number of the SDF personnel and main
organizations of the Ministry of Defense (MOD)/SDF. It
also issues approval for defense operations of the SDF. The
function of national defense entirely falls under the executive
power of the Cabinet as a general administrative function.
The Constitution requires that the Prime Minister and other
Ministers of State who constitute the Cabinet be civilians.
The Prime Minister, on behalf of the whole Cabinet, holds
the authority of supreme command and supervision of the
SDF. The Minister of Defense, who is exclusively in charge
of national defense, exercises general control and supervises
over the SDF duties. In addition, the National Security
Council of Japan under the Cabinet deliberates important


**Chapter**


The exclusively defense-oriented policy means that
defensive force is used only in the event of an attack, that the
extent of the use of defensive force is kept to the minimum
necessary for self-defense, and that the defense capabilities
to be possessed and maintained by Japan are limited to the
minimum necessary for self-defense. The policy including
these matters refers to the posture of a passive defense
strategy in accordance with the spirit of the Constitution.

**2 Not Becoming a Military Power**


There is no established definition for the concept of a military
power. For Japan, however, not becoming a military power
that could threaten other countries means that Japan will not
possess and maintain a military capability strong enough
to pose a threat to other countries, beyond the minimum
necessary for self-defense.

**3 Non-Nuclear Principles**


The Three Non-Nuclear Principles refers to those of not
possessing nuclear weapons, not producing them, and not
allowing them to be brought into Japan. Japan adheres to
the Three Non-Nuclear Principles as a fixed line of national
policy.
Japan is also prohibited from manufacturing and
possessing nuclear weapons under the Atomic Energy Basic
Law.[1] In addition, Japan ratified the Treaty on the NonProliferation of Nuclear Weapons (NPT), and as a nonnuclear weapons state, has an obligation not to manufacture
and acquire nuclear weapons.[2]

to the Middle East for information gathering [Website of the Prime Minister's Office of Japan]


Article 2 of the Atomic Energy Basic Law states that “The research, development and utilization of atomic energy shall be limited to peaceful purposes, aimed at ensuring safety and
performed independently under democratic management.”

Article 2 of the NPT states that “Each non-nuclear-weapon State Party to the Treaty undertakes...not to manufacture or otherwise acquire nuclear weapons or other nuclear explosive
devices...”

matters on national security.[4]

At the MOD, the Minister of Defense takes charge of
and manages the matters concerning national defense, and
as the competent minister also manages and operates the
SDF. The Minister of Defense is assisted in policy planning
and political affairs by the State Minister of Defense, the
Parliamentary Vice-Ministers of Defense (two) and the
Senior Adviser to the Minister of Defense.
In addition, the Special Adviser to the Minister of Defense
provides the Minister of Defense with advice on important
affairs under the jurisdiction of the MOD based on their
expertise and experience. The Defense Council consisting

4 S Ch t 2 S ti 1


of political appointees, civilian officials and uniformed SDF
personnel deliberates on basic principles concerning affairs
under the Ministry’s jurisdiction. Through these ways, the
MOD aims to further ensure civilian control.
As mentioned above, the civilian control system is well
established. However, in order to ensure that the system
achieves good results, it is necessary to continue making
practical efforts in both political and administrative aspects,
along with a deep interest in national defense taken by the
people.

**Section**
**National Security Council**
**1**


As the security environment surrounding Japan grows
increasingly testing, Japan faces mounting security
challenges that it needs to address. Under such
circumstances, it is necessary to carry forward the policies
pertaining to national security from a strategic perspective
under strong political leadership with the Prime Minister at
its core. For this reason, the National Security Council was
established in the Cabinet to provide a platform to discuss
important matters with regard to Japan’s security, and has
been serving as a control tower for foreign and defense
policies. Since its establishment in December 2013, the
Council has met 224 times (as of the end of April 2020).
The National Security Strategy (NSS) and the National
Defense Program Guidelines for FY2019 and beyond
(NDPG) are also deliberated and approved in this National
Security Council.
The National Security Secretariat established within
the Cabinet Secretariat provides constant support to the
National Security Council as its secretariat. The Secretariat
is also tasked with planning and designing, and overall
coordination of basic guidelines and important matters with
regard to foreign and defense policies pertaining to national
security. Administrative organs that are deeply involved in
policies support the Secretariat with both personnel and


information. Considering that the coverage of security has
been expanding to the economic and technology fi elds in
recent years, in order to address challenges to the national
security in the economic fi eld, “Economy Group” was set
up in the Secretariat in April 2020. The Secretariat has
many civilians and uniformed personnel of the Ministry of
Defense (MOD) with concurrent posts, who are engaged
in the planning and designing of policies, as well as the
utilization of respective specialized knowledge. In addition,
global military trends and other information are shared in a
timely manner.
The enhanced ability to formulate national security policies
has led to the systematic alignment of Japan’s national security,
and to the provision of a direction for policies with regard to new
security challenges. Furthermore, individual defense policies are
formulated and efforts to accelerate decision-making are made
based on the basic guidelines discussed at the National Security
Council, and this is contributing signifi cantly to improved
development and implementation of policies within the MOD.

2 The Government has made replies regarding civilian control and the role of the civilian offi cials in the Internal Bureaus during the Diet deliberations on the Amendment Act, stating: “Civilian
control means prioritizing politics over the military in democratic countries. Civilian control in our country consists of control by the Diet, control by the Cabinet (including the National
Security Council), and control within the MOD. Control within the MOD means that the Minister of Defense, a civilian, manages, operates, and controls the SDF. In addition to support from
political appointees, such as the State Minister of Defense and Parliamentary Vice-Ministers of Defense, support from civilian offi cials in the Internal Bureaus also plays an important role in
aiding the exercise of civilian control by the Minister of Defense. The role of civilian offi cials in the Internal Bureaus in civilian control is to support the Minister of Defense, and there is no
relationship in which civilian officials of the Internal Bureaus issue commands to units ”

**❷** **[Joint Operations System of the SDF]**

In order to rapidly and effectively fulfill the duties of the
SDF, the MOD/SDF has adopted the joint operations system
in which the GSDF, the MSDF, and the ASDF are operated
integrally. Furthermore, in the future, it will work toward
building an architecture that is capable of realizing crossdomain operations including new domains, which are space,
cyberspace, and electromagnetic spectrum.

**1 Outline of Joint Operations System**


**(2)Relationship between Chief of Joint Staff, and Other Chiefs**
**of Staff**

The Joint Staff undertakes functions relating to the operations
of the SDF, while the Ground, Maritime and Air Staff Offices
undertake functions for unit maintenance, such as personnel
affairs, building-up defense capability, and education and
training.

See Fig. II-2-2-5 (Operational System of the SDF and Roles of �

See

the Chief of Joint Staff and the Chiefs of Staff of the Ground,
Maritime, and Air Self-Defense Forces)

**2 Strengthening Joint Operational Functions**


**(1) Role of Chief of Joint Staff**

a. The Chief of Joint Staff develops a joint operations concept
for SDF operations, and centrally supports the MOD on
SDF operations from a military expert’s perspective.
b. The Minister’s commands concerning the operations of
the SDF are delivered through the Chief of Joint Staff,
and orders concerning operations of the SDF are executed
by the Chief of Joint Staff. In doing this, the Minister’s
commands and orders are delivered through the Chief of
Joint Staff not only in cases where a joint task force[3] is
organized, but also in cases where a single SDF unit is
employed to respond.


**Chapter**


**(1) Past Initiatives**

In order to ensure the accuracy of decision-making relating
to the operations of the SDF and to make the process swifter,
in October 2015, the Bureau of Operational Policy was
abolished and some of its functions, such as the planning and
drafting of laws and regulations relating to unit operations,
were transferred to the Bureau of Defense Policy in order to
unite affairs concerning actual operations of the units into
the Joint Staff. This change has made the Joint Staff assume

Staff Councilor, a post for civilian offi cials at the level of
a division director and department director general have
been established to conduct external coordination duties,


etc., taking advantage of the expertise of civilian offi cials
concerning actual operations of the units.
**(2) Future Initiatives**

In order to realize cross-domain operations, the Joint Staff’s
posture designed for effi cient SDF operations and for new
domains will be strengthened, thereby enabling swift and
effective exercise of the SDF’s total capabilities. In addition,
the future framework for joint operations will be examined.

**Section**
**Outline of the National Security Strategy (NSS)**
**1**


**❶ [Japan’s National Security Policy Framework]**

The NSS approved by the National Security Council and the
Cabinet in December of 2013 represents Japan’s fi rst ever
basic policy on national security with a focus on diplomatic
affairs and defense policy. The NSS defi nes approaches that
Japan should follow based on a long-term view of its national
interests. It replaces the Basic Policy on National Defense,
which had served as the basis for Japan’s defense policies
theretofore.
The National Defense Program Guidelines (NDPG),
which was established based on the NSS, defi nes basic
policies for Japan’s future defense, the role of its defense
capabilities, and objectives for specifi c Self-Defense
Forces (SDF) equipment. The NDPG was formulated with
a medium-to-long-term outlook because the acquisition of
defense equipment and the establishment of troop operational
systems cannot be accomplished overnight and requires


many years of planning. The NSS and NDPG are mainly
designed for the next decade or so.
The Medium Term Defense Program (MTDP) specifi es
a maximum budget and the amount of mainstay defense
equipment to be acquired over the subsequent fi ve-year
period in order to achieve the defense capability targets
defi ned in the NDPG. The fi scal year budget is drawn on the
MTDP substantiated as projects, and the necessary expenses
for each fi scal year will be appropriated based on relevant
situations.
To date, the NDPG has contained mention of nationwide
basic security policies focusing on defense policy to a certain
extent. The NSS carries great meaning as the defi nitive
statement of the Government’s basic policy on national
security, with a focus on diplomatic affairs and defense
policy.


**Chapter**


❷ **[Outline of the NSS: Proactive Contribution to Peace]**


Japan is committed to continuing the path it has followed
to date as a peace-loving nation and, as a major player in
international politics and business, it also seeks its own
security as well as peace and stability in the Asia-Pacifi c
region from the perspective of a Proactive Contribution
to Peace. Japan will contribute more proactively than
ever before to the peace, stability, and prosperity of the
international community.


In achieving the aforementioned fundamental principle of
national security, the NSS makes national interests and goals
clear, and demonstrates a strategic approach that needs to be
employed.

the formulation of international norms in fi elds such as space
and cyberspace. Japan will also further advance steady-state
efforts such as strategic communications.
In order to address a range of situations including armed
contingencies and “gray-zone” situations, Japan further needs
to seamlessly deal with various situations in a coherent, wholeof-government manner by way of swift and pertinent decisionmaking under even stronger political leadership, which will be
assisted by an enhanced support mechanism.
In addition, Japan will also strengthen organization for
disaster response and civil protection, build a posture prepared
to evacuate Japanese nationals overseas during emergencies
and to ensure their safety, and promote measures to protect
infrastructure critical to people’s daily lives, such as electricity
and communication, as well as to protect cyberspace.
In addition to this comprehensive defense system, it is
important to build the Multi-Domain Defense Force and
fulfi ll various roles during peacetime using the defense force
seamlessly and in a combined manner.

**3 Strengthening the Japan-U.S. Alliance**


In line with the NSS and from the perspective of “Proactive
Contribution to Peace,” Japan has enhanced its diplomatic
strength and defense capability. Japan has also promoted
cooperative relationships with other countries, with the JapanU.S. Alliance being a cornerstone. In so doing, Japan under the
Constitution has adhered to the basic precept of maintaining
the exclusively defense-oriented policy and not becoming a
military power that poses a threat to other countries, ensured
civilian control of the military, and observed the Three NonNuclear Principles. Based on this premise, Japan, even amid
the realities of a security environment it has hitherto never
faced, must strive to preserve national interests identifi ed
in the NSS—defend to the end Japanese nationals’ lives,
persons and property, territorial land, waters and airspace,
and its sovereignty and independence.
Defense objectives are to create a desirable security
environment while deterring threats from reaching, and, should
a threat reach Japan, to counter the threat. To this end Japan will
strengthen: (1) Japan’s own architecture for national defense;
(2) the Japan-U.S. Alliance; and (3) international security
cooperation. These efforts, including achieving superiority in
new domains, which are space, cyberspace, and electromagnetic
spectrum, must be carried out swiftly and fl exibly.
In dealing with the threat of nuclear weapons, U.S. extended
deterrence, with nuclear deterrence at its core, is essential:
Japan will closely cooperate with the United States. To deal
with the threat, Japan will also increase its own efforts. At the
same time, Japan will play an active and positive role in nuclear
disarmament and non-proliferation.

**2 Strengthening Japan’s Own Architecture for**
National Defense


**Chapter**


The Japan-U.S. Security Arrangements constitute a
cornerstone for Japan’s national security, and the JapanU.S. Alliance plays a significant role for the peace,
stability and prosperity of the international community.
In this context, Japan needs to press ahead with such
efforts as bolstering the ability of the Japan-U.S. Alliance
to deter and counter threats, enhancing and expanding
cooperation in a wide range of areas, and steadily
implementing measures concerning the stationing of
U.S. Forces in Japan.

**4 Strengthening Security Cooperation**


In order to squarely address the realities of a security
environment that it has hitherto never faced and to securely
achieve national defense objectives, Japan will build a
national defense architecture that will, in all phases, integrate
the strengths at the nation’s disposal, enabling not only the
Ministry of Defense (MOD)/SDF efforts but also coherent,
whole-of-government efforts, as well as cooperation with
local governments and private entities. In particular, Japan
will accelerate its efforts and cooperation in such fi elds as
space, cyberspace, electromagnetic spectrum, ocean, and


In line with the vision of a “free and open Indo-Pacifi c,” Japan
will strategically promote multifaceted and multilayered
security cooperation, taking into account the characteristics
and situation specifi c to each region and country. As part
of such efforts, Japan will actively leverage its defense
capability to work on defense cooperation and exchanges
which include bilateral/multilateral training and exercises,
defense equipment and technology cooperation, capacity
building assistance, and service-to-service exchanges.
Furthermore, Japan will also contribute to address global

|Role|Outline|
|From peacetime to “gray-zone” situations|●The SDF will, in close integration with diplomacy, promote strategic communications including bilateral/multilateral training/ exercises and overseas port visits on a steady-state basis. ●The SDF will conduct persistent intelligence, surveillance and reconnaissance (ISR) activities around Japan. The SDF will prevent the occurrence or escalation of emergencies by employing flexible deterrent options and other measures. ●The SDF will, in coordination with the police and other agencies, immediately take appropriate measures in response to actions that violate Japan’s sovereignty including incursions into its territorial airspace and waters.|
|Attack against Japan including its remote islands|●The SDF will quickly maneuver and deploy requisite units to block access and landing of invading forces while ensuring maritime and air superiority. ●Even when maintaining maritime and air superiority becomes untenable, the SDF will block invading forces’ access and landing from outside their threat envelopes. ●Should any part of the territory be occupied, the SDF will retake it by employing all necessary measures. ●Against airborne attack by missiles and aircraft, the SDF will respond in a swift and sustained manner by applying optimal means and minimize damage to maintain SDF’s capabilities as well as the infrastructure upon which such capabilities are employed. ●In response to attack by guerrillas or special operations forces, SDF will protect critical facilities including nuclear power plants and search and destroy infiltrating forces.|
|Space, cyber and electromagnetic domains during all phases|●To prevent any actions that impede its activities, the SDF will conduct, on a steady-state basis, persistent monitoring as well as collection and analysis of relevant information. ●In case of an event that impedes its activities, the SDF will promptly take such measures as damage limitation and recovery. ●In case of armed attack against Japan, the SDF will block and eliminate the attack by leveraging capabilities in space, cyber and electromagnetic domains. ●SDF will contribute to comprehensive, whole-of-government efforts concerning these domains under appropriate partnership and shared responsibility with relevant organizations.|
|Large-scale disasters|●The SDF will swiftly transport and deploy requisite units to take all necessary measures for initial response, and, as required, maintain its posture for disaster response for a longer term. ●The SDF will carefully address the needs of affected citizens and local governments. ●The SDF will engage in life saving, temporary repair and livelihood support in appropriate partnership and cooperation with relevant organizations, local governments and the private sector.|
|Collaboration with the United States based on the Japan-U.S. Alliance|●In all stages from peacetime to armed contingencies, Japan will effectively conduct activities by playing on its initiative its own roles in the Japan-U.S. Alliance.|

Concerning the budgetary process for each fi scal year,
in order to adapt to increasingly rapid changes in the security
environment, Japan must strengthen its defense capability at
speeds that are different from the past. Moreover, to achieve rapid
procurement of defense equipment, Japan must pursue fl exible
and swift project management, and the budgetary process for
each fi scal year which will be conducted taking into account the
economic and fi scal conditions among other budgets.


The amount of expenses based on contracts (material
expenses) to be newly concluded to implement this MTDP
will be allocated within the ceiling of approximately ¥17.17
trillion in FY2018 prices (excluding the amount corresponding
to payments outside of the program period for contracts that
contribute to improving project effi ciency such as maintenance),
and the future obligation shall be managed appropriately.

maneuver and deployment capability, in order to effectively deal
with various situations by employing them in combination with
the capabilities in the new domains. Moreover, in addition to
enhancing the sustainability and resiliency of defense capability
including logistics support, Japan gives priority to reinforcing
the human resource base in light of the aging population with


a declining birth rate and reinforcing the technology base due
to advances in military technologies. The MOD/SDF will
also strengthen the Japan-U.S. Alliance as well as security
cooperation with other countries in view of changes in the
security environment.
At the same time, in this process, the MOD/SDF
will strengthen its defense capability at speeds that are
fundamentally different from the past and by allocating
resources fl exibly and intensively. Furthermore, the MOD/
SDF will further promote jointness of the Ground, Maritime
and Air Self-Defense Forces in all areas and, avoiding a stovepiped approach, optimize their organizations and equipment.
In addition, considering the increasingly severe fi scal
conditions and other factors, Japan will strictly work to
achieve greater effi ciency and streamlining.

**❷ [Breakdown of Defense-Related Expenditures]**

Defense-related expenditures are broadly classifi ed into and others. Material expenses are further classifi ed into
“personnel and food provision expenses,” which covers items “obligatory outlay expenses,”[1]which are paid based on
such as wages and meals for SDF personnel, and “material contracts concluded in previous fi scal years, and “general
expenses,” which fi nance the repair and maintenance of material expenses,” which are paid under current-year
equipment, the purchase of fuel, the education and training contracts. Material expenses are also referred to as “program
of SDF personnel and the procurement of equipment expenses,” and since general material expenses include repair

Note: Does not include SACO-related expenses, U.S. Forces realignment-related expenses (the portion allocated for mitigating the impact on local communities), expense for the
introduction of new government aircraft based on “The Policy Concerning Government Aircraft” (August 7, 2013 decision by the Review Committee on Government Aircraft),
and expenses for the three-year emergency response plan for disaster prevention, disaster mitigation, and building national resilience. If these are included, the fi gures are
5,257.4 billion yen for FY2019 and 5,313.3 billion yen for FY2020; and for future obligation, 5,361.3 billion yen for FY2019 and 5,431.0 billion yen for FY2020. Figures may not
add up to the total due to rounding.


Some projects for build-up of defense capabilities extend over multiple years. In these cases, the fi scal year in which the contract is concluded is different from the fi scal year in which the
payment to the contractor is made. Therefore, the future maximum obligation is allocated to the budget as a contract resulting in a Treasury obligation (type of budget that only grants an
authority to incur obligations; the contracts can be concluded, but the payment cannot be made). Based on such budgeting, in the fi scal year in which the construction is completed or the
equipment is procured, expenses necessary for payment are allocated as budget expenditure, in principle (type of budget that grants authorities to incur obligations and make payment; the
contracts can be concluded and the payment can be made). Budget expenditure for payments incurred under contracts concluded in previous fi scal years is called “obligatory outlay
expenses,” while expenditure for future fi scal years is termed “future obligation.”
For cases where a continued project over multiple years is necessary, there is also a system of continuing expenditure as a means to grant the authority to incur obligations and make

Including these expenses, total defense-related expenditures were as follows: 4,813.6 billion yen in FY2006, 4,801.3 billion yen in FY2007, 4,779.6 billion yen in FY2008,
4,774.1 billion yen in FY2009, 4,790.3 billion yen in FY2010, 4,775.2 billion yen in FY2011, 4,713.8 billion yen in FY2012, 4,753.8 billion yen in FY2013, 4,884.8 billion yen

5,313.3 billion yen.


costs for equipment, education and training expenses for
personnel, and the purchase of fuel, they are referred to also
as “activity expenses.” The MOD terms this classification
method as “classification by expenses.”
Personnel and food provision expenses as well as obligatory
outlay expenses, both of which are mandatory expenses, account
for 80% of the total defense-related budget. The remaining
20% of the budget includes spending for repairing equipment
and for implementing measures to alleviate the impact on
local communities hosting U.S. bases in Japan. As such, a
high percentage of the budget is allocated for maintenance
purposes. For this reason, the breakdown of the defense-related
expenditures cannot be easily altered in a significant manner on
a single-year basis.

See Fig. II-4-2-3 (Relationship between Annual Expenditure and
Future Obligation Concerning New Contracts)


In addition to the annual budget expenditure, the amount
of future obligations concerning new contracts also indicates
payments for the following year and beyond (the amount of
future obligation arising in the applicable fiscal year). In the
build-up of defense capabilities, it is common to take multiple
years from contract to delivery or completion, in areas such as the
procurement of vessels, aircraft, and other primary equipment,
as well as the construction of buildings such as aircraft hangars
and barracks. Consequently, for such items, a procedure is
undertaken whereby a multi-year contract is arranged, and it is
promised in advance at the time of the contract that payments
will be made in the following fiscal year and beyond (within
five years, in principle). The sum of money to be paid in the
following fiscal year and beyond, based on such a multi-year
contract, is called the amount of future obligation. The amount
of future obligation concerning new contracts arising in FY2020
increased from the previous fiscal year by 3.7 billion yen (0.2%).
Furthermore, if looked at on a contract basis,[3] which shows
the scale of operations, there is an increase from the previous
fiscal year of 15.5 billion yen (0.5%).

See Part IV, Chapter 2, Section 3-1 (Project Management
throughout Equipment Life Cycle)


**Chapter**


Personnel and food provision expenses were decreased by
40.5 billion yen from the previous fiscal year, while obligatory
outlay expenses for the year increased by 90.5 billion yen.
General material expenses increased by 11.8 billion yen from
the previous fiscal year.[2]

**❹ [Comparison with Other Countries]**

It is not possible to accurately compare the amounts of defense
expenditures of countries due to a number of factors: there is
no internationally unified definition of defense expenditures
in the first place; even if defense expenditures were publicly

**Fig. II-4-2-5** The Defense Expenditures of Major Countries (2019)

Defense expenditures (100 million dollars) Defense expenditures as % of GDP


disclosed, their overall amount or their breakdown is
sometimes unclear; and the budget system varies by country.
On such basis, if Japan’s defense-related expenditures
and those of other countries officially published by each
government were converted into dollar amounts, using the
purchasing power parity[4] of each country reported by the
Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development
(OECD), the results would be as shown in Fig. II-4-2-5 (The
Defense Expenditures of Major Countries).

Notes: 1. Defense expenditures are based on those officially published by each country and are in US dollars while

referring to each country’s purchasing power parity for FY2019 as published by the OECD (officially

published rate as of May 2020)

(1 dollar = 103.367215 yen = 3. 538620 yuan =25.468534 rubles = 850.299894 won = 1. 471620

Australian dollars = 0. 689107 pound = 0. 754103 France euros = 0. 741735 Germany euros)
2. The percentage of GDP is calculated based on defense expenditures officially published by each country

(in local currency) while referring to the GDP of each country published by the IMF (in local currency).
3. As defense expenditures published by NATO (which include pensions for retired veterans, etc.) may differ

from those officially published by each country, the percentage of GDP based on defense expenditures

published by NATO (in November 2019) does not necessarily coincide with the percentage of GDP

calculated based on defense expenditures officially published by each country.
4. The GDP of each country published by the IMF is an estimate as of October 2019.


In addition, Fig. II-4-2-6 (Changes in Defense
Expenditures in Major Countries Over the Past Ten Years)
shows the changes in defense expenditures of Japan’s
neighboring countries over the past ten years.

Offi cial title: Act on the Peace and Independence of Japan and Maintenance of the Nation and the People’s Security in Armed Attack Situations, etc., and a Survival-Threatening Situation

“Armed Attack Situations” refers to situations in which an armed attack against Japan from outside occurs or in which it is considered that there is an imminent and clear danger of an
armed attack. “Expected Armed Attack Situations” refers to situations in which an armed attack is not yet made but the tension increased and an armed attack is expected. Both situations
are collectively called “Armed Attack Situations, etc.”

A “Survival-Threatening Situation” means a situation where an armed attack against a foreign country that is in a close relationship with Japan occurs, which in turn poses a clear risk of
threatening Japan's survival and of overturning people's rights to life, liberty and pursuit of happiness fundamentally.

A contingency situation, other than an Armed Attack Situation and Survival-Threatening Situation, and a situation that may have a signifi cant impact on the security of the nation and the
people, including an emergency response situation (a situation where actions that may kill or injure many people by using methods equivalent to those used in an armed attack, or a

The law sets forth the following measures in order to avoid
integration with the use of force by a foreign country and
also to ensure the safety of the SDF personnel:

-  The SDF does not conduct activities in “the scene where
a combat is actually taking place.” Regarding search and
rescue operations, however, when stranded personnel have
been located and rescue operations have commenced,
the SDF units are allowed to continue search and rescue
activities as long as the safety of these units is ensured.

-  The commanding officers, etc., of the SDF units order
the temporary suspension of activities, etc., if combat
operations occur or are expected to occur at the site of their
activities or in the vicinity.

-   The Minister of Defense designates the area for implementing
activities, and if it is deemed difficult to implement operations
smoothly and safely in the whole or part of that area, the
Minister must promptly change the designation of the area or
order the cessation of the activities being implemented there.

**1 Public Security Operations**


**3 Counter-Piracy Operations**


**(1) Public Security Operations by Order**
In the event of an indirect aggression or another emergency
situation, the Prime Minister can order the whole or part of the
SDF to deploy if it is deemed impossible to maintain public
security with the general police force. In principle, the Prime
Minister must bring the order to the Diet for deliberation, and
request for its approval within twenty days from the day the
order has been given.
**(2) Public Security Operations by Request**
Upon consulting with the Public Safety Commission of the
prefecture concerned, the governor of that prefecture can
request the Prime Minister to dispatch units, etc., of the
SDF if it is deemed unavoidable as the situation will have
a serious influence on public security. Following such a
request, the Prime Minister can order the SDF to mobilize
when a situation calls for such action.

See Part III, Chapter 1, Section 2-3 (Response to Attacks by

When there is a special need to respond to acts of piracy,
the Minister of Defense may order SDF units to conduct
operations at sea against such acts upon approval by the

Defense shall create a response guideline and submit it to the
Prime Minister.

Other Objects


In cases where ballistic missiles or other objects are flying
to Japan as an armed attack or flying to Japan in a SurvivalThreatening Situation, and where the “Three Conditions”
are met, the SDF can respond with the defense operation.
In cases where ballistic missiles or other objects are flying
to Japan but which are not found as an armed attack, the
Minister of Defense can take the following measures:
(1) If the Minister of Defense judges that ballistic
missiles or other objects are likely to fly to Japan and
that it is necessary to prevent damage to human lives
and property due to its fall in the territory of Japan,
the Minister, upon the approval of the Prime Minister,
can order the SDF units to take measures to destroy
the ballistic missiles or other objects in the airspace
over the territory of Japan or the high seas when such

Concept of ensuring civilian control of the military

-  Response against ballistic missiles requires the government to assess the possibility of missiles flying toward Japan by comprehensively analyzing and evaluating the
specific situation and international circumstances. In addition to the SDF destroying the missile, interagency actions are required, for example, measures for civil
protection such as alert and evacuation, diplomatic activities, information gathering by related agencies, and enhancement of readiness for emergencies.

-  In view of the importance of the matter and the necessity of action by the Japanese government as a whole, the Cabinet and Minister of Defense can sufficiently fulfill
their responsibilities upon the Prime Minister’s approval (Cabinet decision) and orders by the Minister of Defense. Furthermore, the supervision of the Diet is also

**(2) Requirements for Implementation**

When all of the following conditions are satisfied, the rescue
measures may be implemented:
a. It needs to be confirmed that in the areas where the rescue
measures are taken, the competent authorities of the
country concerned are maintaining public safety and order
at the time, and no act of combat will be conducted;
b. The country concerned[10] consents to the SDF taking the
rescue measures (including the use of weapons); and
c. It is expected that coordination and cooperation can be
ensured between the units of the SDF and the competent
authority of the country concerned in order to carry out
the rescue measures as smoothly and safely as possible in
response to anticipated dangers.

(2) In addition to the cases of (1) above, there may be
cases where the situation suddenly changes with little
information available on the launch, for example, and the
Minister of Defense cannot have time to obtain approval
from the Prime Minister. In preparation for such cases, the
Minister of Defense may create an emergency response
manual beforehand and obtain approval from the Prime
Minister. Following the emergency response manual, the
Minister of Defense can order, for a specified period of
time, the SDF units to take measures to destroy ballistic
missiles or other objects in the airspace over the territory
of Japan or the high seas when such objects are actually
flying to the country.

**7** [Protection of Weapons and Other Equipment of ]
the Units of the U.S. Forces and the Armed
Forces of Other Foreign Countries

Based on Article 95-2 of the SDF Law, it has been
established that the SDF personnel may protect weapons
and other equipment of the units of the U.S. Forces and the
armed forces of other foreign countries actually engaging
in activities that contribute to the defense of Japan in
cooperation with the SDF. The basic principles of the article
and the Cabinet’s involvement in its operation are provided
by “The Implementation Guidelines for Article 95-2 of the
Self-Defense Forces Law”[11] decided by the National Security
Council.
**(1) Coverage**

Weapons, etc. of the units of the United States Forces,
armed forces of other foreign countries and other similar
organizations, that are, in cooperation with the SDF and are,
currently engaged in activities that contribute to the defense
of Japan (including bilateral/multilateral exercises but
excluding activities in the scene where the combat activities
are actually being conducted).
**(2) Procedures, etc.**

When a request is made by the United States Forces, etc., and
only when the Minister of Defense deems it necessary, SDF
personnel provide asset protection.


**5** Measures against Intrusion of Territorial Airspace

The Minister of Defense may order SDF units to take necessary
measures to make intruding aircraft land or withdraw from
the territorial airspace of Japan (guiding intruders away,
issuing radio transmission warnings, use of weapons, etc.)
when a foreign aircraft intrudes Japan’s territorial airspace in
violation of international law, the provisions of the Aviation
Law or other relevant laws and regulations.


**Chapter**


See Part III, Chapter 1, Section 1-2-1 (Warnings and Scrambles in
Preparation against Intrusion of Territorial Airspace)


**6 Rescue and Transportation of Japanese Nationals**
Overseas

In order to protect Japanese nationals, etc. overseas in
emergency situations, the SDF is able to transport those
people who need protection of their lives or bodies to
a safe place. Moreover, when their lives or bodies can be
harmed, the SDF may conduct “rescue measures” that
include guarding and rescue of Japanese nationals, etc. if the
following requirements are satisfied.
**(1) Procedures**

Upon a request from the Minister for Foreign Affairs and
after subsequent consultations between the Minister for
Foreign Affairs and the Minister of Defense, the Minister
of Defense issues an order following approval by the Prime
Minister.

**❹ [Disaster Relief Dispatches and Others]**


**1 Disaster Relief Dispatches**

In principle, Disaster Relief Dispatch is conducted as follows:
prefectural governors or other officials ask the Minister of
Defense, or an officer designated by the Minister, to dispatch
the SDF units, etc., in the event of a natural disaster; the
Minister or the designated officer will dispatch the units if it
is deemed necessary for the SDF to respond to the disaster.[12]
This procedure is based on the idea that prefectural governors
and other officials should grasp the overall conditions of the
disaster and their own disaster relief capabilities first, and
then decide whether to make a request for the SDF disaster
relief dispatch.


**2 Earthquake Disaster Prevention Dispatch and**
Nuclear Disaster Relief Dispatch


When a warning declaration is issued based on the Act on
Special Measures Concerning Countermeasures for LargeScale Earthquakes[13] or a declaration of a nuclear emergency
situation is issued based on the Act on Special Measures
Concerning Nuclear Emergency Preparedness, the Minister
of Defense is authorized to order dispatching units upon
a request of the Director of the Seismic Disaster Warning
Headquarters or the Director of the Nuclear Disaster
Countermeasures Headquarters (the Prime Minister).

etc. and that the SDF personnel never respond to any combat

activities by the use of weapons pursuant to the Article. The

SDF personnel thus never conduct use of force and this

prevents the situation from evolving into combat activities

as a result of the use of weapons under the provision of the

Article.

This use of weapons does not fall under “use of force”

which is banned in Article 9 of the Constitution.

**b. Activities that Contribute to the Defense of Japan**

“Activities that contribute to the defense of Japan” in the
Article may include mainly the following ones, while
the Government of Japan is to examine each activity on
a case-by-case basis: (1) intelligence, surveillance, and
reconnaissance (ISR) activities including ballistic missile
alert; (2) transportation and replenishment activities in
“situations that will have an important infl uence on Japan’s
peace and security”; and (3) bilateral/multilateral exercises
to enhance capabilities required for defending Japan.

**c. Judgment on Whether or Not to Conduct Asset Protection**

When the Minister of Defense receives a request from the

U.S. Forces, etc., the Minister subjectively should judge

whether the activities conducted by the units of the U.S.

Forces, etc. in cooperation with the SDF are “activities

that contribute to the defense of Japan” and whether asset

protection by the SDF personnel is necessary, by considering

the objective and content of the activities, capability of the

unit, and surrounding circumstances as well as the impacts

on performance of the SDF’s regular operations.

**(2) Involvement of the Cabinet**

Requests from the U.S. Forces, etc. based on Paragraph 2

of the Article should be deliberated in the NSC before the

Minister of Defense judges on conducting asset protection

if the Minister receives requests in the following cases.

However, in case there is no time for dealing with an urgent

request by the U.S. Forces, etc., the Minister should promptly

report to the NSC regarding judgment of providing asset

protection.

(1) The U.S. Forces, etc. makes a request for the fi rst time

after the operationalization of asset protection.

(2) The request is made for asset protection in the territory of

a third country.

(3) The request is recognized as peculiarly important,

although not falling under the above two categories.
In addition, in case asset protection under the situations
that will have an important infl uence is requested, the Prime
Minister should clearly state it in the Basic Plan and should


**1 Background**


Since the enactment of the Legislation for Peace and Security,
the MOD/SDF have been explaining to and coordinating
with the United States and also engaged in the work to
develop necessary rules and regulations in order to ensure
appropriate operation of the system for the protection of
weapons, etc., of the units of the U.S. Forces and the armed
forces of other foreign countries (SDF Law Article 95-2).
Upon completion of these works, in December 2016, at the
National Security Council (NSC) the Government decided
on the Implementation Guidelines concerning Article 95-2 of
the SDF Law, and the Article became ready to be applied to
the U.S. Forces operations. This operationalization helps to
further strengthen coordinated surveillance between the SDF
and the U.S. Forces and also to further enhance deterrence
and response capabilities of the Japan-U.S. Alliance.

**2 The Implementation Guidelines for Article 95-2 of**
the SDF Law


The Implementation Guidelines for Article 95-2 of the SDF
Law set forth the Government’s basic understanding on the
article as well as basic principles on the involvement of the
Cabinet and disclosure of information in implementing the
article. An outline of the guidelines is as follows:

**(1) Basic Principles of Implementing Article 95-2**

**a. Purpose of Article 95-2**

This Article is to enable SDF personnel to carry out very

passive and limited use of weapons to the minimum extent

necessary to protect weapons and other equipment (“the

weapons, etc.”) of units of the U.S. Forces, armed forces

of other countries or other similar organizations (“the U.S.

Forces, etc.”), that are concurrently engaged in activities

that contribute to the defense of Japan (including bilateral/

multilateral exercises but excluding activities conducted in

places where combat activities are actually occurring) in

cooperation with the SDF, from infringements which do not

amount to an armed attack, because the weapons, etc. can be

regarded as an important material means which constitute the

defense capability of Japan.

Through the provision of Paragraph 1 of the Article that

“excluding activities conducted in places where combat

activities are actually occurring,” it is ensured that asset

protection is not to be, nor to be legally regarded as being

integrated (“ittaika”) with the use of force of the U.S. Forces,

ask for a Cabinet decision on it after deliberations in the
NSC.
The NSC Board is to be held flexibly and support the full
NSC. In addition, the relevant ministries and agencies are
to share information on requests for protection and closely
cooperate with each other.
**(3) Disclosure of Information**

In the implementation of Article 95-2, if an unusual
event occurs in conducting asset protection operation,
the Government promptly discloses such an event, and
releases a basic plan that specifies matters concerning the
implementation of asset protection operations in a situation
that will have an important influence on Japan’s peace
and security. The Government also strives for appropriate
disclosure of information in light of the Act on Access to


Information Held by Administrative Organs (Act No. 42 of
1999).

**3 Track Record of Asset Protection Operations in**
2019


In 2019, during ISR activities including ballistic missile alert,
SDF vessels conducted asset protection for U.S. military
vessels four times, and during joint exercises, SDF vessels
conducted asset protection for U.S. military vessels once and
SDF aircraft for U.S. military aircraft nine times, totaling 14
times.

**Japan s Own Architecture for**
**National Defense**
###### 1


Concerning the strengthening of Japan’s own architecture for
national defense, the National Defense Program Guidelines
for FY2019 and beyond (NDPG) states that Japan will
build a truly effective defense capability, “Multi-Domain
Defense Force,” which: organically fuses capabilities in all
domains including space, cyberspace and electromagnetic
spectrum; and is capable of sustained conduct of fl exible and
strategic activities during all phases from peacetime to armed
contingencies.
Defense capability is the ultimate guarantor of Japan’s
national security. Defense capability represents Japan’s will
and ability to: deter threat from reaching Japan; and should
threat reach Japan, eliminate the threat and, as a sovereign
nation, by exerting efforts on its own accord and initiative,
defend to the end Japanese nationals’ life, person and property
as well as territorial land, waters and airspace.
At the same time, defense capability is essential for Japan
to play on its initiative its roles in the Japan-U.S. Alliance
at all phases from peacetime to armed contingencies.
Strengthening Japan’s defense capability to provide for
national security is none other than strengthening the
Japan-U.S. Alliance. Defense capability is essential also for
advancing Japan’s efforts in security cooperation with other
countries.

**Section**

**Response from Peacetime to Grey Zone Situations**

**1**


Among the roles that must be served by Japan’s defense
capability as set forth in the NDPG, the idea of “(1) response
from peacetime to ‘gray-zone’ situations” is as follows.
The Self-Defense Forces (SDF) will enhance its presence
on a steady-state basis by actively engaging in, among others,
bilateral/multilateral training and exercises and overseas port
visits, thereby demonstrating Japan’s will and capability.
The SDF will, in close integration with diplomacy, promote
strategic communications, including the aforementioned
activities by SDF units.
The SDF will leverage its capabilities in all domains to
conduct wide-area, persistent intelligence, surveillance and
reconnaissance (hereinafter referred to as “persistent ISR”)
activities around Japan. The SDF will prevent the occurrence
or escalation of emergencies by employing fl exible deterrent


Defense capability is the most important strength for
Japan in retaining self-sustained existence as a sovereign
nation amid security environment it has never faced before.
Japan must strengthen this capability on its own accord and
initiative.
The NDPG states that, in order to create a security
environment desirable for Japan and to deter and counter
threats, Japan’s defense capability must be able to serve the
following six roles in a seamless and combined manner:
(1) response from peacetime to “gray-zone” situations; (2)
countering attacks against Japan, including its remote islands;
(3) response in space, cyberspace and electromagnetic
domains during all phases; (4) response to large-scale
disasters, etc.; (5) cooperation with the United States based
on the Japan-U.S. Alliance; and (6) promotion of security
cooperation.
In particular, in view of protecting the lives and peaceful
livelihoods of Japanese nationals, it is all the more important
for Japan’s defense capability to fulfi ll diverse roles on a
steady-state basis.

See  Reference 10 (Conditions Required for Main Operations of the
Self-Defense Forces (Including Diet Approval) and Authority
for the Use of Weapons Concerning Main Operations of the
Self-Defense Forces)


**Chapter**


options and other measures. Leveraging posture in place for
these activities, the SDF will, in coordination with the police
and other agencies, immediately take appropriate measures
in response to actions that violate Japan’s sovereignty,
including incursions into its territorial airspace and waters.
The SDF will provide persistent protection against
incoming ballistic missiles and other threats, and minimize
damage should it occur.

See  Section 2-2 of this Chapter (Response to Missile Attacks)
Chapter 3 Section 1 (Strategic Promotion of Multi-Faceted
and Multi-Layered Defense Cooperation)


-----

**❶ [Persistent ISR in the Area Surrounding Japan ]**

**1 Basic Concept**


Japan is comprised of a little over 6,800 islands, and is
surrounded by wide sea space, which includes the sixth
largest[1] territorial waters (including inland waters) and
Exclusive Economic Zone (EEZ) in the world. The SDF is
engaged in persistent intelligence collection and warning and
surveillance during peacetime over Japan’s territorial waters
and airspace, as well as the surrounding sea and airspace so
that it can respond to various contingencies immediately and
seamlessly.

**2** Response by the Ministry of Defense (MOD)/SDF


GSDF personnel engaged in warning and surveillance activities


The Maritime Self-Defense Force (MSDF) monitors ships
navigating in the waters surrounding Hokkaido, the Sea
of Japan, and the East China Sea from peacetime, using
patrol aircraft[2] and other aircraft. The Air Self-Defense
Force (ASDF) uses radar sites at 28 locations nationwide,
and early warning and control aircraft[3] amongst others, to
carry out warning and surveillance activities over Japan and
its surrounding airspace. These activities of the MSDF and
ASDF are done 24 hours a day. Warning and surveillance
activities in major channels are also conducted 24 hours a day
by MSDF guard posts, Ground Self-Defense Force (GSDF)
coastal surveillance units, and other assets.[4] Furthermore,
in order to maintain a posture to swiftly respond to various
situations, warning and surveillance activities are carried
out with the fl exible use of destroyers, aircraft, and so on as
required. The information obtained through such surveillance
activities is shared with the relevant ministries and agencies,
including the Japan Coast Guard, in order to strengthen
coordination.
To show an example of the events that were reported
from SDF’s surveillance, following September 2012 when
the Government of Japan acquired property rights to and
ownership of three of the Senkaku Islands (Uotsuri Island,
Minamikojima Island, and Kitakojima Island), Chinese
government vessels carried out intermittent intrusions into
Japan’s territorial waters surrounding the Senkaku Islands.[5]
In June 2016, a Chinese Navy combatant vessel entered
Japan’s contiguous zone to the north of the Senkaku Islands

for the fi rst time. In December 2016, six vessels including
the aircraft carrier “Liaoning” passed through the sea area
between the main island of Okinawa and Miyakojima
Island, and entered the Pacifi c. This was the fi rst time
that the entry of this aircraft carrier into the Pacifi c Ocean
was confi rmed. In July 2017, a Chinese naval intelligence
collection ship entered Japanese territorial waters southwest
of Kojima (Matsumae, Hokkaido) passing east through the
Tsugaru Strait to the Pacifi c Ocean. In January 2018, the
SDF confi rmed that a Chinese submarine and warship had
been navigating through the Japanese contiguous waters
of the Senkaku Islands on the same day. Furthermore, in
April, in waters some 350 km south of Yonaguni Island, a
number of (presumed) fi ghter jets were observed taking off
from the aircraft carrier “Liaoning” for the fi rst time. Also
in June 2019, the SDF confi rmed that six vessels, including
the aircraft carrier “Liaoning,” passed through the sea area
between the main island of Okinawa and Miyakojima Island,
and entered the Pacifi c. In April 2020, six vessels, including
the aircraft carrier “Liaoning,” passed through the sea area
between the main island of Okinawa and Miyakojima
Island, and entered the Pacifi c. In the same month, the SDF
confi rmed that the same vessels passed through the sea area
between the main island of Okinawa and Miyakojima Island
to the East China Sea. This time again, carrier-based fi ghters
were observed taking off and landing on the aircraft carrier
in the Pacifi c Ocean. In FY2019 the SDF made public 12
cases of activities involving Chinese naval vessels passing
through the sea area between the main island of Okinawa and
Miyakojima Island.
It has been pointed out that North Korea is attempting
to evade United Nations (UN) Security Council sanctions
through smuggling. As part of its regular warning and
surveillance activities in Japanese territorial waters, the SDF
is carrying out information gathering on vessels suspected
of violating the UN Security Council sanctions. During the
period from 2018 to the end of March 2020, the SDF patrol
aircraft have observed 24 cases[6] of seaborne rendezvous
between North Korean tankers and foreign-fl agged tankers
in the East China Sea. The information was shared with
relevant agencies and ministries. In a comprehensive
judgment across the government, the vessels concerned are

from the previous fiscal year. Chinese aircraft continue to
be highly active, as this is the 2nd highest figure since the
number of scrambles by country and region was first made
public in 2001.
A distinctive example arose in May 2017 when a drone
caused an airspace violation as it flew above a Chinese
government vessel entering Japanese territorial waters
near the Senkaku Islands. Japan lodged protests against the
Chinese government through diplomatic channels. In August
that year, six Chinese military bombers were observed in an
unprecedented flight from the East China Sea over the main
island of Okinawa and Miyakojima Island northeast across
the Pacific to an area off the Kii Peninsula before returning.
Then in December, five aircraft including two fighter jets

10 Thi th fi t ti th t Chi fi ht h b fi d t i th J S


flew over the Tsushima Strait and entered the Japan Sea
airspace.[10] Then in April 2018, a (presumed) unmanned
Chinese aircraft flew across the East China Sea. With
these kinds of acts, China is expanding and intensifying
the activities of its air force inside Japanese airspace and
one-sidedly escalating its actions in some cases. It is a
troubling situation.
ASDF aircraft scrambled 268 times in response to Russian
aircraft, which was a decrease by 75 times compared to the
previous year.
As a distinctive example, in June 2019, two Tu-95 long
range bombers intruded into Japan’s airspace above the
territorial waters of Minamidaitojima Island (Okinawa
Prefecture). One of them further intruded into Japan’s
airspace above the territorial waters of Hachijojima
Island (Tokyo). Japan lodged protests against the Russian
government through diplomatic channels. In July 2019, two
Chinese H-6 bombers and two Russian Tu-95 long-range

fighter-bomber was confirmed for the first time above the Sea
of Okhotsk in a scramble. Due attention needs to be paid to
the activities of Russian aircraft.
Even after the establishment of the “East China Sea Air
Defense Identification Zone (ADIZ)” by Chinese government
in November 2013, the MOD/SDF has conducted warning
and surveillance activities as before in the East China Sea,
including the Chinese ADIZ. The MOD/SDF also engages
in strict measures against intrusion of territorial airspace in
accordance with international law and the SDF Law.

operations will be issued. The submarine will be requested
to navigate on the surface of the water and show its flag, in
accordance with international law, and in the event that the
submarine does not comply with the request, the SDF will
request it to leave Japanese territorial waters.

submarines navigating under the territorial waters of Japan.
In November 2004, the MSDF observed a submerged
Chinese nuclear-powered submarine navigating under
Japanese territorial waters around the Sakishima Islands.
In response to this incident, the MSDF issued an order for
maritime security operations, and continued to track the
submarine with MSDF vessels until it entered the high seas.
Recently, in January 2018, a submerged submarine was
spotted by MSDF assets including a destroyer moving
through Japanese contiguous zones of the Senkaku Islands.
The submarine was then observed surfacing in international

establishment of the MSDF Special Boarding Unit;[13] (3)
equipment of destroyers with machine guns; (4) furnishing
forcible maritime interdiction equipment (flat-nose shells);[14]
(5) improving the sufficiency ratio of military vessel

the then Defense Agency and the Japan Coast Guard in
1999, they have regularly conducted the training in order to
strengthen coordination.

The Japan Coast Guard, as a police organization, is primarily
responsible for responding to suspicious armed special

the Japan Coast Guard to respond to a situation, an order for
maritime security operations will be issued and the situation
will be handled by the SDF in cooperation with the Japan
Coast Guard.

**Section**
**2** **Defense of Japan including its Remote Islands**


Among the roles that must be served by Japan’s defense
capability as set forth in the NDPG, the idea of “(2) countering
attacks against Japan, including its remote islands” is as
follows.
In response to attack on Japan including its remote islands,
the SDF will quickly maneuver and deploy requisite units to
block access and landing of invading forces while ensuring
maritime[1] and air[2] superiority. Even when maintaining
maritime and air superiority becomes untenable, the SDF
will block invading forces’ access and landing from outside
their threat envelopes. Should any part of the territory be
occupied, the SDF will retake it by employing all necessary
measures.
Against airborne attack by missiles and aircraft, the SDF
will respond in a swift and sustained manner by applying

**❶ [Defense of Japan’s Remote Islands ]**


optimal means and minimize damage to maintain SDF’s
capabilities as well as the infrastructure upon which such
capabilities are employed.
In response to attack by guerrillas or special operations
forces, the SDF will protect critical facilities including
nuclear power plants and search and destroy infi ltrating
forces.
In responding to such attacks, the SDF will implement
cross-domain operations that organically fuse capabilities in
space, cyberspace and electromagnetic domains to block and
eliminate attacks.
In view of protecting the life, person and property of
the nationals, the SDF will implement measures for civil
protection.

and vessels, and then regaining the territory by the landing
of GSDF forces.

See Fig. III-1-2-1 (Conceptual Image of Defending Japan’s Remote

See

Islands)


**Chapter**


**1** Basic Concept

Japan possesses numerous remote islands. In order to respond
to attacks on these islands, it is important to station units and
so forth in accordance with the security environment, and
also to maneuver and deploy them according to situations on
a steady-state basis. It is also important to ensure maritime
and air superiority by detecting signs at an early stage through
persistent ISR conducted by the SDF.
If signs of attack are detected in advance, units will be
maneuvered and deployed in an area expected to be invaded
ahead of the deployment of enemy units, and block access
and landing of invading forces. Even when maintaining
maritime and air superiority becomes untenable, the SDF
will block invading forces’ access and landing from outside
their threat envelopes.
Should any part of the territory be occupied, the SDF
will retake it by employing all necessary measures such as
bringing the enemy under control by ground fi re from aircraft


**2** Initiatives of the MOD/SDF

In order to strengthen its defense architecture in the
southwestern region, the ASDF established the 9th Air Wing
in January 2016 and newly formed the Southwestern Air
Defense Force in July 2017. The GSDF, in addition to the
Yonaguni coast observation unit formed in March 2016 and
other newly-formed units, established the Amphibious Rapid
Deployment Brigade with full-fl edged amphibious operation
capabilities in March 2018. Moreover, the GSDF deployed
some units, including an area security unit in Amami Oshima,
and an area security unit in Miyakojima Island, in March
2019. A surface-to-air missile unit and a surface-to-ship
guided missile unit were deployed to Miyakojima Island in

Maritime superiority refers to the condition in which one side has a tactical advantage over the opposing force at sea and can carry out maritime operations without suffering substantial
damages by the opposing force.

In order to deal with ships and landing forces attempting
to invade Japan while ensuring the safety of SDF personnel,
the SDF procured stand-off missiles which are capable of
responding from the outside of their threat envelopes, and
has started research and development (R&D) on technologies
required for new anti-ship missiles and Hyper Velocity
Gliding Projectiles (HVGPs) for the defense of remote
islands to take all initiatives necessary to defend the islands
since FY2018, and technologies required for hypersonic
weapons since FY2019.
Also, in order to secure capabilities for swift and largescale transportation and deployment of units, initiatives are
underway to enhance rapid deployment capabilities through:

the length of the runway, and potential use as relocation
destination of JGSDF Camp Metabaru. In August 2018, the
Governor of Saga prefecture expressed their acceptance. The

period of time. In response to the statement of Kisarazu
Mayor to cooperate with the provisional deployment plan
made in December of the same year, the MOD established
a Tactical Airlift Wing that operates Osprey in March 2020.
Meanwhile, various types of training to increase the
capability for amphibious operations are being undertaken.

in December of the same year, the then Security Council and
Cabinet decided to begin Japan-U.S. cooperative development
of an advanced ballistic missile interceptor. To date, Japan
has steadily built up its own defense system against ballistic
missile attacks, by such means as installing ballistic missile
defense capability to the Aegis-equipped destroyers and
deploying the Patriot Advanced Capability-3 (PAC-3).[4]


**1** [Japan’s Comprehensive Air and Missile Defense Capability]

against ballistic missile attacks. Necessary amendments
were subsequently made to the SDF Law in July 2005, and

*JADGE (Japan Aerospace Defense Ground Environment) is a core system for the command and control as well as communication functions. It centrally processes the information regarding aircraft captured by radars installed nationwide,

and it provides fghters with instructions required for scrambling against aircraft intruding into Japanese territorial airspace and air defense combat operations. In addition, it controls Patriot and radar, etc. in response to ballistic missiles.


Currently, Japan’s BMD is an effective multi-layered
defense system with the upper tier interception by Aegis
equipped destroyers and the lower tier by Patriot PAC-3,
both interconnected and coordinated by the Japan Aerospace
Defense Ground Environment (JADGE).[5] The upcoming
introduction of the land-based Aegis system, Aegis Ashore,
will enable our forces to intercept missiles in the upper tier
not just from Aegis destroyers but from land.
Today airborne threats to Japan are increasingly complex
and diverse, including ballistic missiles equipped with
multiple/maneuverable warheads, high-speed and longer-range
cruise missiles, and stealth and multi-role aircraft. In order
to effectively and effi ciently counter these airborne threats
by optimum means and minimize damage, it is necessary to
establish a structure to conduct integrated operation of various
equipment for missile defense and air defense equipment
that each SDF service has separately used, thereby providing
persistent nation-wide protection from peacetime and also
enhancing the comprehensive air and missile defense capability
that can simultaneously deal with multiple, complex airborne
threats. In this regard, the SDF will strive to standardize and


streamline the means for interception that each SDF service
possesses, including their maintenance and supply systems.
In case ballistic missiles or other objects are launched
against Japan as an armed attack, it will be dealt with
by issuing a defense operation order for armed attack
situations. On the other hand, when such situation is not yet
acknowledged as an armed attack, Japan will take measures
to destroy the ballistic missiles.
As a response against ballistic missiles or other objects,
the Joint Task Force-BMD is formed, with the Commander
of the Air Defense Command serving as its Commander, and
various postures for effective defense are to be taken under a
unifi ed command through JADGE. Furthermore, the GSDF
will play a leading role in dealing with damage caused by the
impact of a fallen ballistic missile.

(2) Response by the MOD/SDF

Since 2016, North Korea has conducted three nuclear tests
and launched more than 70 ballistic missiles and others.
These military actions by North Korea pose grave and
imminent threats to Japan’s security. North Korea expressed
its intention to fully denuclearize the Korean Peninsula at the
North Korea-United States summit held in June 2018, and
disclosed destruction of its nuclear test ground. However, the
second North Korea-United States summit held in February
2019 ended without any agreement and North Korea has
not so far dismantled all its weapons of mass destruction or
ballistic missiles in a complete, verifi able and irreversible
manner. North Korea is assessed to have already successfully
miniaturized nuclear weapons to fi t ballistic missile warheads
through repeated nuclear tests and ballistic missile launches
to date, and it possesses and deploys several hundred ballistic
missiles capable of reaching almost every part of Japan.
Some of the missiles that were launched in 2019 and are
presumed to be new models have a shape similar to that of
Russian short-range ballistic missile “Iskander,” which can
fl y at a lower altitude than conventional ballistic missiles and
on an irregular trajectory. It is suggested that the aim is to
penetrate missile defense systems.


**Chapter**


The MOD/SDF continues to carefully monitor the
concrete actions of North Korea toward the dismantlement of
weapons of mass destruction and missiles, and conducts the
necessary intelligence, warning and surveillance activities,
and other necessary activities while closely cooperating with
the United States and other countries.
Further cooperation with the U.S. Government including

the U.S. Forces in Japan is essential for effi cient and
effective operation of the BMD system. Thus, related
measures including constant real-time sharing of BMD
operational and relevant information, and the expansion of
BMD cooperation have been agreed upon at the Japan-U.S.
Security Consultative Committee (2+2 Meeting).
Furthermore, Japan has closely cooperated with the United
States in responding to ballistic missiles, by means such
as receiving Shared Early Warning (SEW)[6] from the U.S.
Forces, and sharing intelligence gathered by assets including
transportable BMD radar (TPY-2 radar) and Aegis-equipped
destroyers deployed in Japan by the U.S. Forces.
Maintenance, enhancement and validation of Japan-U.S.
bilateral response capabilities have been actively conducted
through training and other activities. Since FY2010, BMD
special exercises have been held between the MSDF and the

U.S. Navy, connecting their ships and other equipment via
a network to conduct the integrated air and missile defense
exercise. The ASDF participated in 2018, and the GSDF
in 2019 in this exercise. The exercise is conducted as an
integrated air and missile defense exercise aimed to improve
tactical skills and strengthen cooperation.
Beyond Japan-U.S. cooperation, it is significant to
bolster the cooperation between Japan, the United States
and the Republic of Korea. In January, March, October
and December 2017, trilateral ballistic missile information
sharing exercises were held in waters off Japan with the
objective of strengthening coordination.
Sensitive information related to ballistic missiles, etc.
is adequately shared with relevant countries, including
the United States through a secured infrastructure and
framework[7] to protect secrets.
The SDF engages in various training in peacetime to
improve its capability to counter ballistic missiles. It has
been conducting PAC-3 maneuver deployment training from
June 2017 in an effort to strengthen the SDF’s capability
to counter ballistic missiles and generate a sense of safety
and security among the public. It has conducted 25 training
sessions as of the end of March 2020 including deployments
to public facilities.

premise, the SDF has worked to increase the number of Aegis
BMD destroyers. So far, the MOD completed refurbishment
of two without BMD capabilities, “Atago” and “Ashigara,”
to give them BMD capabilities by December 2018. The


MOD also decided to acquire two additional Aegis-equipped
destroyers with BMD capabilities using the FY2015 and
FY2016 budgets. These projects will increase the number of
Aegis-equipped destroyers with BMD capabilities from the
existing six to eight by FY2020.
Meanwhile, Japan and the United States are jointly
developing advanced interceptor missiles for BMD (SM3 Block IIA), which will be the successor to SM-3 Block
IA to be mounted on Aegis-equipped destroyers, and
promoting the project to its deployment, in order to deal with
future threats posed by increasingly advanced and diverse
ballistic missile attacks. At the National Security Council
9-Minister Meeting in December 2016, a decision was made
to transition to joint production and the deployment phase.
Since the FY2017 budget, SM-3 Block IIA acquisitions are
ongoing. Acquisition and deployment of SM-3 Block IIA
are planned to be implemented in FY2021. In comparison
with the previous SM-3 Block IA, SM-3 Block IIA will
have not only extended interceptable altitude and coverage
of protection, but also have enhanced defeating capability
and simultaneous engagement capability. In addition, it is
expected that the interception capabilities of SM-3 Block
IIA will be enhanced against ballistic missiles equipped
with interception avoidance measures such as a decoy and
ballistic missiles launched with an intention to avoid being

With regard to Patriot PAC-3, the MOD has been working
for procurement of the enhanced capability type, PAC3 (MSE) (Missile Segment Enhancement) and started its
deployment at the end of FY2019. Introduction of PAC3MSE will realize the extension of interception altitude from
less than 20 km to tens of km, meaning that the coverage of
protection (area) will expand more than twice compared with
the current PAC-3.
In this way Japan is taking measures necessary to
strengthen its protection structure and plans to continue the
efforts.[9]

See Fug. III-1-2-5 (Major Initiatives for Improvement of the Capability
to Counter Ballistic Missiles)


(4) Introduction of Aegis Ashore

In the past, the BMD of Japan was based on deploying Aegisequipped destroyers, etc. in preparation for interception for
a required period of time after early detection of signs of
missile launch. Under the past posture regarding a possible
missile attack on Japan, the MOD has believed that protection
of the entire territory of Japan was achievable if about two
of the destroyers continued BMD missions in the sea for a
certain period of time with a system of eight Aegis-equipped
destroyers.
Meanwhile, North Korea has improved its practical launch
capability using a transporter erector launcher (TEL) and
developed submarine-launched ballistic missiles (SLBM),
which makes it diffi cult to grasp signs of launch at an early

By taking a higher trajectory than minimum energy trajectories (trajectories that enable effi cient fl ying of a missile and maximize its range), it takes a shorter range than the maximum
range, but the falling speed of the missile becomes faster.

stage. In light of the changing situation, it is necessary to
maintain a persistent 24-hour, 365-day deployment of Aegisequipped destroyers for a long period of over one year. This
fact triggered a review of the past Japanese ballistic missile
defense posture itself.
Furthermore, under the current Aegis equipped destroyer
system that requires frequent long-term deployment, the
working environment for crew onboard these destroyers
is extremely severe. The service requires high level of
concentration day and night to cope with ballistic missiles
that can be launched anytime.
Under these circumstances, with North Korea’s nuclear
weapons and missiles posing grave and imminent threats
to Japan’s security, Japan must work to drastically upgrade
its ballistic missile defense capabilities in order to ensure
constant and sustained protection from peacetime. At
meetings of the National Security Council and Cabinet
in December 2017, a decision was made to introduce two
Aegis Ashore units, to be retained by the GSDF. Aegis
Ashore refers to a missile defense system that consists of
radars, a command communication system, a vertical launch
system (VLS), etc. similar to Aegis-equipped destroyers
but deployed on the ground. Aegis Ashore conducts
exoatmospheric interception of fl ying ballistic missiles from
the ground. It is a piece of equipment with parts other than
the ship hull of an Aegis-equipped destroyer on the ground
in a fi xed position. The introduction of two units of Aegis
Ashore would enable seamless defense of the entire territory
of Japan 24 hours a day and 365 days a year, and the burden
on personnel is anticipated to be lifted signifi cantly. Under
the system of eight Aegis-equipped destroyers, about two of
them had to focus on BMD mission only in the sea in order
to protect the entire territory of Japan. Once Aegis Ashore
is deployed, however, the Aegis-equipped destroyers can be
used for missions ensuring maritime security, conducting
training to maintain these skills, and ensuring suffi cient
rotation of crewmembers, which will be connected to further
strengthen Japan’s deterrence capability as a whole. The radar
units to be mounted on the Aegis Ashore are state-of-the-art
high-performance radar units called SPY-7. This radar will
drastically enhance Japan’s capabilities to respond to ballistic
missiles, including enhancement of the capability against
lofted trajectory launches and response to simultaneous
majority attacks compared with Aegis-equipped destroyer of
the MSDF.
Since GSDF Araya Maneuver Area in Akita Prefecture
and Mutsumi Maneuver Area in Yamaguchi Prefecture
were selected as candidate sites for the deployment of
two units of Aegis Ashore, the MOD has repeated briefi ng
sessions for local governments and residents and provided


explanations on the necessary survey and the need for the
deployment. However, there has been much inappropriate
conduct, such as mistakes in briefi ng material and behavior
showing a lack of respect by a defense offi cial at the briefi ng
session. The MOD sincerely refl ects on our past conduct.
In order to prevent a similar incident from occurring and to
fundamentally strengthen the internal study framework, the
MOD established “Aegis Ashore Introduction Promotion
Headquarters” in June 2019, with the State Minister of
Defense as the head of the offi ce.
Since October 2019 the MOD has been conducting a
feasibility study on deployment at 20 government-owned
areas in Aomori, Akita and Yamagata Prefectures and a
necessary resurvey at Mutsumi Maneuver Area in Yamaguchi
Prefecture by outsourcing, and it has checked and reviewed
the contents of explanation by setting up an “expert council
on technical verifi cation of various surveys” in order to
obtain technical advice. Then in December of the same year,
State Minister of Defense Yamamoto visited Yamaguchi
Prefecture and provided the heads of the relevant local
governments with explanations anew that Aegis Ashore.

(5) Suspension of Aegis Ashore deployment process
a. Announcement by the MOD

The MOD made the following announcement on June 15,
2020.
Regarding the deployment of Aegis Ashore to the Mutsumi
Maneuver Area, since August 2018, the MOD explained to
the local communities based on the discussions with the
U.S. side up to that time that it would take fi rm steps to put
measures to control the fl y-out trajectory of the interceptor
(SМ-3), to make sure the booster would fall within the
Mutsumi Maneuver Area. Meanwhile for Akita Prefecture,
since August of the same year, the MOD explained to the
local communities that the booster would fall into the sea in
the case of the Araya Maneuver Area.
However, as a result of continued discussions with the
U.S. side and proceeding with the study after that, it was
found out in late May 2020 that not only the software but
also the entire system, including the hardware, were required
to be refurbished in order to control the fl y-out trajectories
of SM-3 to surely drop the booster within the Mutsumi
maneuver area or at sea, which would require a considerable
amount of cost and time.
In light of this fi nding of additional cost and time, the MOD
decided to suspend the process related to the deployment
of Aegis Ashore. The MOD would like to apologize and
explain to the local people fi rst, and report the situation to
the National Security Council and consider the way forward

based on the discussion.
b. Public Statement by Prime Minister Abe

Regarding this matter, Prime Minister Abe made the
following statements on June 18, 2020.
We took the decision to suspend the process of deploying
the Aegis Ashore ballistic missile defense system. Given that
the premise on which our explanations to local communities
were based is now different, we must not proceed any further
as proposed. That is the decision we reached.
Meanwhile, the security environment surrounding Japan
is becoming more and more severe. There has been no
change whatsoever in the current state of affairs. Tensions
on the Korean Peninsula are now becoming increasingly
strained. We will secure the lives and peaceful daily lives of
the Japanese people from the threat of ballistic missiles. That
is the most important responsibility of the government. We
must never allow a gap to arise in our nation’s defenses. Peace
is not something granted to us by others; it is something we
earn through our own efforts. The basis of security policy is
none other than Japan’s own efforts. What should we do to
reinforce our deterrence or our capacity to deal with security
matters? What should we do in order to defend Japan to the
end? This summer, we intend to thoroughly discuss at the
National Security Council our national security strategy,
hammer out a new direction, and implement it expeditiously.

system that combines defense systems suited for each of the
following phases of the ballistic missile flight path to provide
a mutually complementary response: (1) the boost phase,
(2) the mid-course phase, and (3) the terminal phase. Japan
and the United States have developed close coordination
concerning ballistic missile defense, and a part of the missile
defense system of the United States has been deployed in our
country in a step-by-step manner.[10]

(2) Japan-U.S. BMD Technology Cooperation, etc.
The Government commenced a Japan-U.S. cooperative
research project on a sea-based upper-tier system in FY1999.
As the result showed good prospects for resolving initial
technical challenges, in December 2005, the then Security
Council and the Cabinet decided to start Japan-U.S.
cooperative development of an advanced ballistic missile
interceptor by using the results of the project as a technical
basis.[11] The joint development started in June 2006 with a
view to expanding the coverage of protection and dealing
with future threats posed by increasingly advanced and
diverse ballistic missiles attacks.
In February and June 2017, Japan and the United States
conducted tests of the SM-3 Block IIA interceptor in waters
off Hawaii. Analysis of the test data confirmed that it meets all
performance requirements. Currently, as part of development
work, the United States is carrying out validation of the data
connection between the Aegis system and the SM-3 Block
IIA, and between radars. Japan continues to cooperate as
required.

Kyogamisaki Communication Site in December 2014. In October 2018, the 38th Air Defense Artillery Brigade Headquarters was deployed in Sagamihara. In addition, BMD-capable Aegis
ships of the U.S. Forces were deployed at Commander Fleet Activities, Yokosuka (Yokosuka City, Kanagawa Prefecture) in October 2015, March 2016 and May 2018.

11 With regard to the Japan-U.S. cooperative development, it is necessary to export BMD related arms from Japan to the United States. In accordance with the Chief Cabinet Secretary’s
statement issued in December 2004, it was determined that the Three Principles on Arms Exports would not apply to the BMD system and related matters under the condition that strict
controls are maintained. Based on these circumstances, it was decided that the prior consent of Japan could be given to the third party transfer of the SM-3 Block IIA under certain
conditions. This decision was formally announced in the Joint Statement of the Japan-U.S. Security Consultative Committee (2+2 Meeting) in June 2011. The Three Principles on Transfer
of Defense Equipment and Technology (Three Principles) received Cabinet approval in April 2014. However, with regard to exceptional measures instigated before the Three Principles were
decided, overseas transfers will continue to be organized in the guidelines for the principles as allowable under the Three Principles.

and materials, to terrorists and countries under suspicion of
proliferating such weapons.
The sarin gas attack[16] on the Tokyo subway in March 1995
is one of the examples of an incident in which these weapons
were used.

（1）Basic Concept

In the event of the use of NBC weapons in Japan in a way that
corresponds to an armed attack, the SDF will conduct defense
operations to repel the armed attack and rescue victims.
Furthermore, in the event of the use of NBC weapons in a
way that does not correspond to an armed attack but against
which the general police alone cannot maintain public
security, the SDF will conduct public security operations to
suppress the armed group and rescue victims in cooperation
with related agencies. Furthermore, when the incident
does not fall under the category of defense operations or
public security operations, the chemical protection units
of the GSDF and other units will cooperate with relevant
organizations in information gathering concerning the extent
of the damage, decontamination activities, transportation of
the sick and injured, and medical activities through disaster
relief and civil protection dispatches.

（2）Initiatives of the MOD/SDF

The MOD/SDF possesses and maintains the GSDF Central
Nuclear Biological Chemical (NBC) Weapon Defense Unit
and the Countermeasure Medical Unit as well as increasing
the number of chemical and medical protection unit personnel,
in order to improve the capability for responding to NBC
weapon attacks. Also, the GSDF has designated personnel
to take initial action in the event of extraordinary disasters
in order to allow operations to begin within approximately
one hour.
The MSDF and the ASDF have also acquired protective
equipment and materials to be used on vessels and at bases.


See


（2）Initiatives of the MOD/SDF

The GSDF has been conducting field training exercises
nationwide with the police of each prefecture, in an effort
to strengthen such collaboration by, for example, conducting
field exercises at nuclear power plants throughout the
country since 2012.[15] Furthermore, joint exercises in dealing
with suspicious vessels have also been conducted regularly
between the MSDF and the Japan Coast Guard.

**❹ [Readiness against Invasion ]**

The NDPG states that only the necessary level of readiness
against land invasions involving the mobilization of large
ground forces, which was expected primarily during the
Cold War, will be retained.
In the event of a military attack on Japan, the SDF will
respond with defensive mobilization. Their operations
are categorized into (1) operations for aerial air defense
operations, (2) defense operations protecting waters around
Japan, (3) operations protecting the land, and (4) operations
ensuring security in maritime communication, based on the
characteristic of their purposes. In executing these operations,
the U.S. Forces will assist the operations implemented by the
SDF and deploy operations to complement the capabilities of
the SDF, including the use of striking power, in line with the
Guidelines for Japan-U.S. Defense Cooperation.

**1** Air Defense Operations


are composed of measures at sea, measures in waters around
our coasts, measures in major straits, and aerial defense above
waters around Japan. We will protect the waters around our
country by combining these multiple operations, blocking
the invasion of our enemies, and attacking and depleting
their combat capabilities.

**3** Operations Protecting the Land


**Chapter**


In order to invade the islands of Japan, invading countries
are expected to gain sea and air superiority, followed by the
landing of ground troops from the sea and airborne troops
from the air.
For invading ground and airborne troops, it tends to be
difficult to exert systematic combat capabilities while they
are moving on their vessels or aircraft or right before or after
they land in our territory. As we protect our land, we need
to make best use of this weakness to deal with our enemies
between coastal and sea areas or at landing points as much as
possible and attack them at an early stage.

**4** Operations Ensuring Security in Maritime Transportation


Based on the geographic features of Japan, in that it is
surrounded by the sea, and the features of modern wars,[17] it
is expected that at first, a sudden attack against Japan will be
exercised by aircraft and missiles, and such aerial attacks are
assumed to be conducted repeatedly, in the case where a fullscale invasion against Japan occurs. Operations for aerial
defense[18] aim to deal with enemy aerial attacks at the farthest
point from our territory, prohibiting enemies from gaining
air superiority and preventing harm to the people and the
sovereign territory of Japan. At the same time, efforts will be
made to inflict significant damage on the enemy thus making
the continuation of their aerial attack difficult.

**2** Defense Operations Protecting Waters Surrounding Japan


Japan depends upon other countries for the supply of much
of its resources and food, making maritime transportation
routes the lifeblood for securing the foundation of our
existence and prosperity. Furthermore, if our country comes
under armed attack, etc., maritime transportation routes will

be the foundation to maintain continuous warfare capabilities
and enable the U.S. Forces to come and assist in the defense
of Japan.
In operations to ensure the safety of our maritime
transportation, the SDF will combine various operations such
as anti-sea, anti-submarine, anti-air and anti-mine operations
to patrol,[19] defend SDF ships, and protect straits and ports,
as well as setting up sea lanes[20] to directly defend Japanese
ships, etc. Aerial defense (anti-air operations) for Japanese
ships on maritime transportation routes will be conducted by
destroyers, and support from fighter jets and other aircraft is


If an armed attack is carried out against Japan, which is an
island country, aerial attacks are expected to be combined with
attacks against our ships and territory by enemy destroyers.
In addition, transport vessels could be deployed to enable
massive enemy ground forces to invade our territory. Our
defense operations protecting the waters surrounding Japan


17 Aerial attacks are important elements influencing the results of modern wars. It is vital to obtain air superiority before or at the same time as implementing ground or maritime operations.
18 A special characteristic of operations for aerial defense is that initial response is critical and can influence the entirety of operations. Thus, Japan needs to maintain its readiness for a quick
initial response on an ongoing basis in peacetime, regularly collect information, and rapidly and comprehensively exert combat capabilities from the outset of operations.

**1** The Whole-of-Government Approach

The National Space Policy Secretariat[1] established in
the Cabinet Offi ce in April 2016 engages in the planning,
drafting, coordinating, and other policy matters relating to
the Government’s development and use of space. In light
of the environmental changes surrounding space policy and
the new security policies stated in the National Security
Strategy (NSS) that was approved by the Cabinet in 2013,
the Basic Plan on Space Policy was decided upon in the
Strategic Headquarters for National Space Policy which
was established within the Cabinet in June 2020. This Basic
Plan was prepared as a 10-year development plan focusing
on approximately the next 20 years to suffi ciently secure
necessary budgets and strengthen the space policy to which
the Government of Japan provides full efforts, including
measures seen from the perspective of space security, setting
goals of (1) Contributions to a variety of national interest;
and (2) Strengthening comprehensive bases that support
Japan’s space activities, including industrial and science and
technology bases. In particular, concerning the contributions
to a variety of national interest, the plan states that Japan
should advance: (1) Ensuring space security; (2) Contributing
to conducting disaster responses, building national resilience
and solving global issues; (3) Creating new knowledge
based on space science and exploration; and (4) Realizing
economic growth and innovations using space as an impetus.
Responding to Japan’s progress in development and
use of outer space, the Diet approved the Act on Ensuring
Appropriate Handling of Satellite Remote Sensing Data


**2** Initiatives of the MOD/SDF

Effective use of satellites for such purposes as informationgathering, communication and positioning is essential for
realizing cross-domain operations. On the other hand, threats
to the stable use of space are increasing.
The MOD/SDF has sought to ensure effective and effi cient
use of space by strengthening information gathering, C2
(command & control) and communication capabilities by
using satellites and through Space Situational Awareness
(SSA). In addition to these initiatives, based on the MidTerm Defense Program (MTDP), the MOD/SDF will work

to enhance capabilities to ensure superiority in the use of
space at all stages from peacetime to armed contingencies.
The efforts include (1) establishing an SSA system in order
to secure the stable use of space; (2) improving various
capabilities that leverage space domain including informationgathering, communication and positioning capabilities, and;
(3) building the capability to disrupt C4I (command, control,
communication, computer, and intelligence) of opponents in
collaboration with the electromagnetic domain.
In so doing, the SDF will (4) work to enhance cooperation
with relevant agencies, including the Japan Aerospace
Exploration Agency (JAXA), and with the United States and
other relevant countries. The SDF will also engage in such
organization building as the creation of units specializing
in space and a dedicated career fi eld, and develop human
resources and accumulate knowledge and expertise in the
space domain. In FY2020, a space domain planning section
(tentative name) responsible for planning pertaining to joint
operation in the space domain will be established in the Joint
Staff.

See Fig. III-1-3-1 (Conceptual Image of Utilization of Space in the
Security Field)

（1）Development of the SSA System

When using outer space, it is necessary to ensure its stable
use. However, there has been a rapid increase in the volume


of space debris in outer space, raising the risk of signifi cant
damage to satellite functions caused by collision between
debris and satellite.
In addition, it is pointed out that the development and
verifi cation test of a killer satellite, which approaches a
target satellite to disturb, attack, and capture it, is underway,
increasing the threat to the stable use of outer space.

That is why the MOD, based on the Basic Plan on Space
Policy and through cooperation with relevant domestic
institutions, such as the JAXA, and the United States, aims
to establish SSA system by FY2022 to monitor and maintain
an accurate picture of conditions in space. It is also working
to deploy radar to monitor threats to Japanese satellites, such
as space debris, and its operating system for information
gathering, processing and sharing. In addition, the ASDF
established the Space Operations Squadron in May 2020 as
the unit specialized in the space domain to operate the system.
In preparation for full-scale SSA operation and introduction
of defense equipment, the ASDF is pursuing (1) study of unit
operations pertaining to the space domain, (2) development
of human resources with knowledge of the space domain,
and (3) establishment of a network of cooperation with
JAXA, the United States and others.
For this to happen, the government agencies and ministries
concerned need to work together to build an effective
operating system. On this point, JAXA is devising a plan to

geostationary orbit (at altitudes of around 36,000 km).
Combined with the radar of the MOD that will principally
be dedicated to geostationary orbit monitoring, Japan is
planning an effective SSA program. For its operation system,
necessary adjustment is in progress to link the system to the
U.S. Forces’ system in addition to JAXA by FY2022.
For the future, in addition to radar to monitor threats to
Japanese satellites such as space debris as mentioned above,
the MOD will introduce SSA satellites that are space-based
optical telescopes and ground-based SSA laser ranging
devices to measure distance from low earth-orbit satellites.
The expenses necessary for acquisition of SSA satellite
components are included in the FY2020 budget.

See Fig. III-1-3-2 (Initiatives for the Development of the SSA System)

（2）Improving Various Capabilities to Leverage Space
Domain Including Information-Gathering,
Communication and Positioning Capabilities

The MOD/SDF has conducted information-gathering,
communication and positioning using satellites, but in order
to fulfi ll its missions effectively and effi ciently, it is necessary
to further enhance these capabilities.
For this purpose, the MOD/SDF will strengthen its
intelligence and surveillance capabilities through multilayered acquisition of satellite images using Information
Gathering Satellites (IGS) and commercial satellites,
including microsatellites. It will also continue to use
images from the satellite operated by JAXA (ALOS-2) and
information from Automatic Identifi cation System (AIS),
etc., and conduct research on dual wavelength infrared
sensors.[2]

Regarding communications, the MOD/SDF launched
X-band defense communications satellites called Kirameki-2
in January 2017 and Kirameki-1 in April 2018, owned and
operated by the MOD for the fi rst time, to be used for the
communications, which is essential for command and
control in unit operations. Going forward, in light of the
future increase in communication requirements, the MOD
will conduct steady development of Kirameki-3 to realize
integrated communications as well as high-speed and large
capacity communications, thereby aiming for the early
realization of a three-satellite constellation with all of
the three X-band defense communications satellites. The
ministry will also conduct research and surveys on the next
defense communication satellites.
With regard to positioning, the MOD/SDF has mounted
GPS receiving terminals on a large number of equipment and
used them as important means to support troop movement,

（4）Enhancing Cooperation with Relevant Agencies and
with the United States and Other Relevant Countries

For the MOD to promote space development and use
effectively, it is essential to enhance cooperation with relevant
agencies with advanced knowledge, including JAXA, and
with the United States and other relevant countries.
Currently the MOD and JAXA are cooperating in
the development of SSA described above and technical


including highly accurate self-positioning and improvement
of missile guidance. In addition to these efforts, the Quasi
Zenith Satellite System (QZSS)[3] of the Cabinet Offi ce started
service in November 2018. With this in mind, the MOD/
SDF will secure redundancy by using multiple positioning
satellite signals, including QZSS.

（3）Enhancing Capabilities to Ensure Superiority in Use
of Space

Utilization of satellites plays a vital role as the basic
infrastructure for security, while some countries appear to be
developing anti-satellite weapons, including killer satellites
and anti-satellite missiles. In this context, the MOD/SDF
needs to improve the resilience of the X-band defense
communications satellite and other satellites.
To this purpose, the SDF will newly introduce training
devices to study and train responses to the vulnerabilities

addition, the ministry exchanges human resources, including
the dispatch of ASDF personnel to the JAXA Tsukuba Space
Center.
Also, from the perspective of further promoting
cooperation in the space field between the defense authorities
of Japan and the United States, the two countries established
the “Japan-US Space Cooperation Working Group (SCWG)”
in April 2015 and so far held six meetings. The SCWG
continues to promote consideration in broader fields such
as: (1) promotion of space policy-related consultation, (2)
closer information sharing, (3) cooperation for training and
securing space experts, and (4) implementation of tabletop
exercises.
As part of such initiatives, the MOD has taken part in
the Global Sentinel, an annual SSA multinational tabletop
exercise hosted by the U.S. Strategic Command since 2016
with the purpose of acquiring knowledge related to the SSA
operation as well as of strengthening cooperation with the

September 2015, the Cybersecurity Strategy was formulated
for the comprehensive and effective promotion of measures
pertaining to cybersecurity, with the aims to create and
develop free, fair and safe cyber space to enhance the vitality
of the economy and society and realize their sustainable
development, to realize a society in which citizens can live
safely and with peace of mind, and to contribute to the peace
and stability of the international community as well as the
security of Japan. Furthermore, in July 2018 the strategy
was reviewed to promote cybersecurity for sustainable
development and initiatives from three perspectives ((1)
mission assurance by service providers, (2) risk management,
and (3) participation, cooperation and collaboration), while
sticking with the basic position of the strategy.


**1** The Whole-of-Government Approach and Other Initiatives

With regard to cybersecurity, the number of cases that
were detected as suspicious communication to Japanese
governmental organizations and required confirmation as to
whether or not they need coping, there were 111 suspicious
malware infections and 66 targeted attacks in FY2018.
This is a situation which requires sufficient and continuous
attention.[4]

In order to deal with the increasing threat to cybersecurity,
in November 2014, the Cybersecurity Basic Act was enacted.
The Act aims to contribute to the security of Japan by
comprehensively and effectively promoting the measures
regarding cybersecurity.
In response to this, in January 2015, the Cybersecurity
Strategic Headquarters was established in the Cabinet,
and the National center of Incident readiness and Strategy
for Cybersecurity (NISC)[5] was established in the Cabinet
Secretariat. The NISC is responsible for planning and
promotion of cybersecurity-related policies and serves as the
control tower in taking measures and responding to significant
cybersecurity incidents in government organizations and
agencies, as well as critical infrastructures. Furthermore, in

（1）Establishing an Environment for Ensuring Cyber
Security

a. Expanding the System of Cyber Defense Group and Other
Units
The Cyber Defense Group was established under the SDF C4
Systems Command in March 2014. In order to appropriately
deal with cyber attacks that are becoming more sophisticated
and skillful day by day, the Cyber Defense Group has
strengthened the system. The group will be further expanded
by about 70 personnel to approximately 290 in FY2020.

b. Strengthening Capabilities of Information Gathering,
Research and Analysis
In order to secure functions of the system and network of
the MOD/SDF under any circumstance, it is necessary to
strengthen the capabilities of information gathering, research
and analysis, and develop a practical training environment.
To this end, the MOD/SDF will continue initiatives such as
(1) upgrade of information gathering devices for indications
and techniques of cyber attacks, (2) enhancing functions of
analysis devices for cyber protection taking advantage of AI
and other advanced technologies, and (3) development of an
environment for cyber exercises carried out as competition
between an attacking team and a defense team.


Working Group (CDPWG) as a framework between the
defense authorities of Japan and the United States. Under this
framework, meetings have been held seven times to discuss
the following topics: (1) promotion of policy discussions
regarding cyber issues, (2) closer sharing of information, (3)
promotion of joint exercises incorporating response to cyber
attacks, and (4) matters such as cooperation for training and
retaining experts. Moreover, in May 2015, the two countries
announced a joint statement on the specifi c future direction
of the cooperation.
In addition, Japan’s cooperation with the United States
is to be further strengthened by such means as participation
in the Japan-U.S. Cyber Dialogue, a whole-of-government
approach by both nations, holding of the Japan-U.S. IT
Forum, a framework between the defense authorities since
2002, and dispatching liaison offi cers to the U.S. Army’s
cyber educational institution.
c. Cooperation with Other Countries etc.
Japan has held cyber dialogues with the respective defense
authorities of the United Kingdom, the North Atlantic Treaty
Organization (NATO), and others. Furthermore, Japan has
participated in cyber defense exercises organized by NATO
or the Cooperative Cyber Defence Centre of Excellence
(CCDCOE). In December 2019 the MOD for the fi rst
time offi cially participated in “Cyber Coalition 2019,” a
cyber defense exercise organized by NATO, to enhance
cooperation with NATO. In addition, the IT Forum has been
held between the defense authorities of Singapore, Vietnam,
and other countries to exchange views on initiatives in the
information communications area including cybersecurity
and current trends in technology.

See Chapter 3, Section 3-2 (Cooperation in the Use of Cyber Domain)

（3）Development and Securing of Human Resources

In order to strengthen the cyber defense capability of the
SDF, it is necessary to secure human resources who have
advanced and broad-ranging knowledge on cybersecurity.
To this end, a common cyber course[8] to learn common and
sophisticated knowledge on cyber security has been provided
since FY2019. The FY2020 budget includes expenses for
sending SDF personnel to universities and educational
institutions, both international and domestic, including the
National War College of the United States, which provides
a course for cyber warfare commanders. It also includes
expenses necessary for holding a cyber competition to
identify highly skilled cyber talents in the private sector. The
MOD/SDF will also work to ensure appropriate treatment
for security and IT human resources who work as a bridge

（2）Keeping Abreast of the Latest Information Including
Risks, Counter Measures and Technological Trends

In order to respond to cyber attacks in a swift and appropriate
manner, it is necessary to keep abreast of the latest
information, including cyber-related risks, counter measures
and technological trends, through cooperation with the
private sector, and strategic talks, joint exercises and other
opportunities with allies and other parties. For this purpose
the MOD/SDF will effectively cooperate with private
companies and foreign countries, including the United
States, which is Japan’s ally.

a. Cooperation with Private Companies and Others
In Japan, in July 2013, the Cyber Defense Council (CDC) was
set up, and its core members consist of around ten companies in
the defense industry with a strong interest in cybersecurity. The
MOD/SDF and the defense industry have made efforts to deal
with cyber attacks through joint exercise and other initiatives.
The MOD/SDF will further expand the cooperation.

b. Cooperation with the United States
Since comprehensive defense cooperation, including joint
response, between Japan and its ally the United States is
vital, the two countries set up the Cyber Defense Policy

**❸** **[Response in Electromagnetic Domain]**

Electromagnetic spectrum[10] has been used for command/
communication, and warning/surveillance. With the
development of the technology, its use has expanded in
range and purpose, and it is now recognized as a major
operational domain situated on the frontline of the offensedefense dynamic in today’s warfare.[11] In response, the
MOD/SDF, based on the NDPG, etc., will (1) enhance its
ability to appropriately manage and coordinate the use
of electromagnetic spectrum, (2) strengthen information
collection and analysis capabilities related to electromagnetic
spectrum, and develop an information sharing posture,
(3) strengthen capabilities to neutralize the radar and
communications of opponents who intend to invade Japan,
and thereby acquire and enhance capabilities to ensure
superiority in the electromagnetic domain.[12]


**Chapter**


**2** Strengthening Information Collection and Analysis Capabilities Related to 
Electromagnetic Spectrum, and Building an Information Sharing Posture

In order to gain an advantage in electromagnetic warfare,
it is important to gather and analyze information on
electromagnetic spectrum at all phases from peacetime to
armed contingencies and appropriately share the information
among SDF units.
To this end, the MOD/SDF plans to enhance information
gathering and analysis capabilities through: establishment
of electromagnetic operation units to gather information
regarding electromagnetic spectrum as subordinate units of
the Ground Component Command; and, under the FY2020
budget, implementation of research for improving the
capabilities of electromagnetic information gathering units
for combatant vessels. In order to share the information
among SDF services while ensuring security of the
information, the SDF will continue to promote the upgrade
of the JADGE system, the connection of each SDF service’s
systems, including the Defense Information Infrastructure


**1 Enhancing the Ability to Appropriately Manage and**
Coordinate the Use of Electromagnetic Spectrum

In order to gain an advantage in warfare by using
electromagnetic spectrum proactively and effectively, it is
necessary to build capabilities to manage electromagnetic
spectrum by centrally grasping and coordinating wave
frequencies and status of use, and appropriately allocating
frequency resources to units, etc. in addition to electronic
warfare capabilities to ensure the use and effect of
electromagnetic spectrum while interfering with the use and
effect by an enemy.

Since April, Minister of Defense Kono held conference
calls with the defense ministers of 15 countries,[5] including
the United States, Australia, India, the Philippines and other
Southeast Asian countries, the United Kingdom, France and
other European countries, Canada and New Zealand, and
exchanged opinions on the roles of the defense authorities
in light of the global expansion of the COVID-19 infection.
Japan-US defense minister conference calls, in particular,
were made twice in total in April and May. During the
calls, the ministers confirmed that the two countries would
ensure close coordination and maintenance of their response
capabilities amid the current situation in addition to close
collaboration to win the battle against COVID-19. Through
conference calls with other countries, the defense authorities
agreed to share information, lessons and knowledge obtained
primarily while taking infection control measures and
confirmed the need to share the understanding of the threat


based on the current situation and the understanding of the
impact of the infection expansion on the countries’ defense
policy considering the roles of the defense authorities.
The ministers also agreed to continue communication
between the defense authorities and strong promotion of
defense cooperation and exchange toward maintenance and
strengthening of the “Free and Open Indo-Pacific.”
In the situation where the COVID-19 infection is
spreading, it is important to actively communicate with
foreign countries. It is also necessary to pay great attention
to the new international order after the end of COVID-19
pandemic. The MOD/SDF recognizes the importance
of further cooperation with foreign countries that share
values and interests in order to maintain the free and open
international order that has supported the world’s peace and
prosperity.

**Section** **Response to Large-Scale Disasters, etc.**
**5**


**❶ [Response to Large-Scale Disasters, etc.]**


When disasters such as natural disasters occur, the SDF
works in collaboration with local governments, engaged in
various activities such as the search and rescue of disaster
victims or ships or aircraft in distress, controlling fl oods,
offering medical treatment, preventing epidemics, supplying
water, and transporting personnel and goods.

**1 Basic Concept**


For this purpose, the SDF is strengthening dissemination of
information so that people who truly need support by the
SDF can easily access the information related to support.
Furthermore the SDF has put in place arrangements for an
initial response to ensure that disaster relief operations are
conducted promptly. This is called “FAST-Force.”

See Fig. III-1-5-1 (Flow from Request to Dispatch and Withdrawal

See

and Response by the Government); Fig. III-1-5-2 (State of
Readiness for Disaster Relief [Standard]); Part II, Chapter 5,
Section 1-4 (Disaster Relief Dispatches and Others)


**Chapter**


Among the roles that must be served by Japan’s defense
capability as set forth in the NDPG, the idea of “(4) response
to large-scale disasters, etc.” is as follows.
In the event of a major disaster, all possible measures
will be taken to rapidly transport and deploy the SDF units
required and if necessary, to sustain the mobilization for
a long period. Not only will the SDF units respond to the
needs of affected residents and local authorities through care,
proper collaboration and cooperation, but they will also be
engaged with institutions concerned, local authorities and the
private sector to save lives, achieve urgent rehabilitation and
provide life support.
Since the damage situation is unclear at the beginning of
a disaster, the SDF will maintain response readiness to any
damage and need for activities while giving the fi rst priority
to life-saving activities. For livelihood support, the SDF will
coordinate the division of roles, response policy, activity
period, utilization of private companies and other matters
with relevant parties including the local governments and
ministries concerned at the local response headquarters, etc.
In addition, based on the “Examination Report on the
Initial Response to the Heavy Rain in July 2018” (November
2018), in order to rescue and support more victims in the
event of a large-scale disaster and considering possible
confusion of the local authorities, the MOD/SDF will not
only wait for requests from the authorities but also actively
propose specifi c support activities by the SDF. In actual
activities, the SDF will provide fl exible support by accurately
gathering needs, which change depending on the situation.[1]


**2 Response by the MOD/SDF**

**（1）Response to Natural Disasters, etc.**


a. Disaster Relief in Response to the Flooding Caused by Heavy
Rain Accompanying a Front in August 2019
In August 2019 a heavy rain around northern Kyushu caused
river fl ooding. In response to disaster relief requests from the
governor of Saga Prefecture, the SDF sent liaison offi cers
to coordinate closely with local governments to save lives,
provide bathing facilities and meals, respond to an oil leak
from iron works, support accumulation of disaster waste
and epidemic control, distribute goods, supply water at
hospitals and music by a band, for example. This mission
involved approximately 32,000 personnel in total, 7,500 of
whom engaged in the affected area, and 50 aircraft. In total,
approximately 150 people were rescued, and 4,200 were
provided with bathing facilities.

b. Disaster Relief in Response to the 2019 Boso Peninsula
Typhoon (Typhoon Faxai)
In September 2019 a violent storm accompanying the 2019
Boso Peninsula Typhoon (Typhoon Faxai) caused a largescale blackout due to fallen utility poles and other damage.
In response to disaster relief requests from the governors
of Chiba and Kanagawa Prefectures, the SDF sent up to
50 liaison offi cers to coordinate closely with the Tokyo

Recently, the scale of SDF’s disaster relief operations has become large and the period of the operations has also become long due to record heavy rains and typhoons. As the GSDF played
a leading role in disaster relief operations in response to the 2019 Boso Peninsula Typhoon (Typhoon Faxai), the 2019 East Japan Typhoon (Typhoon Hagibis), and others, approximately 300
training/exercises were cancelled downsized or postponed

Prefecture to respond to the challenge together with the
Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry, the Ministry of
Land, Infrastructure, Transport and Tourism and the TEPCO.
During the mission, the SDF fl exibly provided support in
response to the needs of the victims: for example, personnel
for other activities were temporarily sent to implement blue
sheet covering, which became urgent as the forecast said the


weather would worsen. This mission involved approximately
96,000 personnel in total, 54,000 of whom engaged in the
affected area, and 20 aircraft. In total, approximately 1,300
tons of water was supplied, 28,000 people were provided
with bathing facilities and blue sheets were installed at
around 1,820 places in 27 cities and towns.

response readiness. In order to ensure an appropriate initial
response, the SDF sent liaison offi cers to the prefectural
offi ces without waiting for requests from the local authorities,
while keeping initial response units and others at the ready
for the action.
Typhoon Hagibis caused river fl ooding, large-scale
inundations and sediment disasters in many places. In
response to disaster relief requests from the governors
of Iwate, Miyagi, Fukushima, Ibaraki, Tochigi, Gunma,
Saitama, Chiba, Tokyo, Kanagawa, Nagano and Shizuoka
Prefectures, the SDF sent approximately 590 liaison offi cers
to coordinate closely with up to 272 local governments to


save lives, supply water, provide bathing facilities and
meals, dispose disaster waste, eliminate load obstacles and
control epidemics. Considering that damage caused by
Typhoon Hagibis was immense and extremely widespread,
it was expected to require various relief activities for a long
period of time. To address the challenge, the SDF established
a joint task force led by the Commander of the Ground
Component Command for the fi rst time. In addition, SDF
Reserve Personnel and SDF Ready Reserve Personnel were
called up and approximately 410 such personnel engaged
in support activities. This mission involved approximately
880,000 personnel in total, 84,000 of whom engaged in the

d. Disaster Relief in Response to Classical Swine Fever (CSF)
Outbreak
Between July 2019 and the end of March 2020, the occurrence
of CSF was confi rmed in Aichi, Gifu, Mie, and Okinawa
Prefectures. As prompt epidemic prevention measures,
including slaughter of pigs, were required, the SDF assisted
with the slaughter and other measures in response to disaster
relief requests from the governors of the prefectures.[2] These
missions engaged around 9,250 personnel and 1,440 vehicles.


e. Disaster Relief in Response to Forest Fire
Over the period from July 2019 to the end of March 2020,
local authorities conducted fi refi ghting operations against
fi ghting forest fi res but were unable to settle the situation
despite their efforts. Based on requests issued by the
governors of Hiroshima, Miyazaki and Ibaraki Prefectures,
the SDF contributed to aerial fi refi ghting and other resources.
The SDF dispatches were conducted three times in total,
including a total of some 380 personnel, around 30 vehicles
and around 20 aircraft. Approximately 260 tons of water was
applied on 45 occasions.

In addition, the SDF carries out sea rescues upon requests
by the Japan Coast Guard on such occasions as transport of
emergency patients from vessels navigating areas of ocean far
from the mainland where the aircraft of other organizations
are unable to respond, due to reasons including a short fl ight
range and emergencies of vessels due to incidents such as
capsizing. Furthermore, the SDF conducts long-distance
transportation for serious-case patients, by the ASDF

**（2）Transportation of Emergency Patients**

The SDF uses its aircraft to transport emergency patients
from isolated islands and remote areas with insuffi cient
medical facilities (transportation of emergency patients). In
FY2019, out of a total of 449 cases of disaster relief, 365
cases involved the transportation of emergency patients, with
dispatches to remote islands such as the Southwestern Islands
(Okinawa and Kagoshima Prefectures), the Ogasawara
Islands (Tokyo), and remote islands of Nagasaki Prefecture

SDF’s earthquake response capability. In FY2018 the SDF
carried out training in preparation for an earthquake directly
hitting the Tokyo area. In FY2019, the SDF carried out
training assuming the occurrence of an earthquake directly
hitting the Tokyo area during the Tokyo 2020 Olympic and
Paralympic Games.[3]

b. Tomodachi Rescue Exercise (TREX) Joint Disaster Response
Exercise with U.S. Forces

In February 2020, joint exercises were held with U.S.
Forces stationed in Japan in the scenario of the Nankai
Trench earthquake. The purpose of the exercise was to
maintain and enhance earthquake disaster relief capabilities
in collaboration between the SDF and U.S. forces and to
strengthen cooperation with relevant local authorities.

c. Remote Island Disaster Relief Exercise (RIDEX)

In September 2019, the SDF participated in general disaster
prevention training planned and organized by Okinawa
Prefecture and a disaster drill of Ishigaki citizens and
conducted a field training exercise to deal with sudden largescale disasters in a remote island to maintain as well as

**（3）The MOD/SDF Response to Nuclear Disaster**

In order to respond to nuclear disasters, the MOD/SDF has
formulated “The SDF Nuclear Disaster Response Plan.”
The SDF also participates in general nuclear disaster
prevention drills jointly implemented by the government,
local governments, and nuclear operators, to confirm the
effectiveness of municipal governments’ evacuation plan
and to strengthen cooperation with relevant agencies in a
nuclear disaster emergency. Moreover, since October 2014,
SDF personnel (five personnel as of March 31, 2020) were
transferred (on temporary assignment) to a section in charge
of nuclear disaster prevention within the Cabinet Office
as part of an effort to enhance the effectiveness of nuclear
disaster response capabilities.


**Chapter**


**（4）Formulating Plans for Responding to Various Disasters**

In the event of the occurrence of various disasters, the
MOD/SDF will take all possible measures such as swift
transportation and deployment of sufficiently sized units
in their initial response. By establishing a rotating staffing
posture based on a joint operational approach, the MOD/
SDF will ensure that it is able to sustain a well-prepared
condition for a long-term response. In doing so, the MOD/
SDF will fully take into account the lessons learned from the
Great East Japan Earthquake and other disasters.
The MOD/SDF formulates various contingency plans
for responses to large-scale earthquakes, which are under
consideration at the Central Disaster Management Council,
based on the Ministry of Defense Disaster Prevention Plan to
respond to such earthquakes.


**（5）Exercises Involving the SDF**

In order to respond to large-scale and various other disasters
in a speedy and appropriate manner, the SDF carries
out various disaster prevention drills, and also actively
participates in disaster prevention drills organized by the
Japanese Government or local governments and is seeking to
ensure cooperation with various ministries and agencies, and
local governments.

confirmed through the experiences of the Great East Japan
Earthquake and other disasters. In particular, each GSDF
regional Army establishes a forum for interaction with senior
directors for crisis management and other officials from local
governments and share information and exchange opinions
to strengthen collaboration with those local governments.
In the event of a disaster, liaison officers are sent quickly
and effectively from the units to the local municipalities in
order to ensure smooth coordination.


**（6）Collaboration with Local Governments and Other**
Relevant Organizations

It is important for the MOD/SDF to strengthen collaboration
with local governments and other relevant organizations
under normal circumstances for the purpose of conducting
disaster relief operations smoothly. For this reason, the SDF
implements various measures including: (1) Assignment of
the post of Liaison Officer for Civil Protection and Disaster
Management (administrative official) at the SDF Provincial
Cooperation Offices; (2) Temporary assignment of SDF
officers to the department in charge of disaster prevention

at the Tokyo Metropolitan Government, and mutual
exchange between administrative officials of both the GSDF
Middle Army and Hyogo Prefectural Government; and (3)
Recommendation of retired SDF personnel with knowledge
in disaster prevention in accordance with requests from local
governments.
As of the end of March 2020, as many as 575 retired
SDF personnel are working in disaster prevention and
other sections in 398 local governments in 46 prefectures
throughout the country. Such cooperation in human resources
is a very effective way of strengthening collaboration between
the MOD/SDF and local governments, and its efficacy was

**（7）Actions Based on the Three-Year Emergency**
Measures for Disaster Prevention, Mitigation, and
Building National Resilience

In December 2018, the three-year emergency measures
for disaster prevention, mitigation, and building national
resilience[5] were approved by the Cabinet. Under the
measures, the MOD is focusing on emergency measures for
concrete block walls, etc. of SDF facilities, for SDF facilities
and for SDF equipment related to disaster prevention, from
the perspective of maintaining functions including important
infrastructure for disaster prevention.


See


Fig. III-1-5-4 (List of the Three-Year Emergency Measures for
Disaster Prevention, Disaster Mitigation, and Building National
Resilience [MOD])


In addition, the following drills were conducted and participated in, in 2019: (1) government tabletop drills, (2) the Nuclear Energy Disaster Prevention Drill, (3) the large tsunami disaster
prevention drill, (4) a drill related to the Comprehensive Disaster Prevention Drill of Nine Prefectural and City Governments, (5) a drill related to the joint disaster drill among the Kinki
prefectures, (6) comprehensive disaster prevention drills conducted by local governments or other bodies.

In recent years, the Heavy Rain in July 2018, Typhoon Jebi in 2018, Hokkaido Eastern Iburi Earthquake in 2018 and other natural disasters caused function loss of important infrastructures
necessary for living and economic activities of the people, including the occurrence of blackouts and closure of airport terminals, which had a major effect on the activities. Learning from
the experience, the Emergency Countermeasures stipulate physical and non-physical measures that individual ministries and agencies should implement intensively for the period of three
years from the perspective of maintaining functions including important infrastructure for disaster prevention and important infrastructure supporting the national economy and people’s

relevant ministries and the Embassy of Japan in Thailand.
With the participation of Japanese nationals in Thailand, the
exercise strengthened the collaboration between the MOD/
SDF and the Ministry of Foreign Affairs.
The MOD/SDF has conducted the transportation
of Japanese nationals in four cases. Responding to the
kidnapping of foreigners and Japanese in Iraq, 10 Japanese
evacuated to Kuwait by an ASDF C-130H plane in April 2004.
In January 2013, a government aircraft was deployed to bring
seven Japanese nationals and the remains of a further nine
nationals back to Japan following the kidnapping in Algeria.
With respect to the terrorist attack in Dhaka, Bangladesh,
which occurred in July 2016, the bodies of Japanese victims
(seven nationals), their families, and other involved parties
were transported to Japan by a government aircraft.
In relation to the deterioration of the situation in South
Sudan in July of the same year, the ASDF transport aircraft
C-130H transported four embassy staff from Juba to Djibouti.


**1** Basic Concept


In the event of natural disasters, insurgencies, and other
emergencies overseas, the Minister of Defense can order
SDF units to rescue or transport Japanese nationals and other
people overseas upon request from the Minister for Foreign
Affairs to guard, rescue or transport Japanese nationals
overseas, etc. and upon subsequent consultations with
the Minister, on the basis of Article 84-3 (rescue Japanese
nationals overseas, etc.) or Article 84-4 (transport of Japanese
nationals overseas, etc.) of the SDF Law.

**2** Initiatives of the MOD/SDF


**Chapter**


For prompt and appropriate implementation of rescue
or transport of Japanese nationals overseas, the SDF is
prepared to dispatch its units swiftly. Specifically, the SDF
maintains operational readiness, with the GSDF designating
personnel to a helicopter unit and a unit responsible for
land transportation, the MSDF designating vessels such as
transport ships (including ship-based aircraft), and the ASDF
designating airlift units and personnel for dispatch.
Since these activities require close coordination among
the GSDF, MSDF and ASDF, the MOD/SDF constantly
conducts joint exercises. In December 2019, the SDF carried
out an exercise in Japan for the rescue of Japanese nationals
overseas to practice the whole process of the actions and
coordination with related organizations in order to enhance
integrated operational capabilities and to strengthen the
coordination with the related organizations. Furthermore,
from February to March 2020, the MOD/SDF also utilized the
opportunity of the annual multilateral exercise Cobra Gold
taking place in Thailand as training in a series of activities to
protect Japanese nationals overseas in cooperation with the

**Section** **Information Gathering Activities for Ensuring the**
**6** **Safety of Japan-related Vessels in the Middle East**


**❶ [Background of the Deployment of the SDF to the Middle East]**


Peace and stability in the Middle East are crucial to the peace

and prosperity of the international community, including

Japan. In addition, it is very important to ensure the safety of

Japan-related vessels in the Middle East, which is the world’s

major energy source and on which Japan depends for about

90% of its crude oil imports.

In the Middle East, amidst rising tensions, there were

incidents of attacks on ships. In June 2019, Japan-related

vessels suffered damage. Under these circumstances, the

United States, European countries, and other countries are

taking steps to ensure the safety of navigation in the region

by utilizing ships and aircraft.

In order to ease tensions and stabilize the situation in the

Middle East, the Japanese government has actively promoted

diplomatic initiatives, including Prime Minister Abe’s visit to

Iran in the same month, and the Japan-U.S. summit meeting

during the UN General Assembly and the Japan-Iran summit

meeting in September.

In this context, based on the discussions that took place

among the Prime Minister and other relevant ministers at

the National Security Council and other meetings, Japan

has decided to take its own initiative to ensure peace and

stability in the Middle East and the safety of Japan-related

vessels. On October 18, the Chief Cabinet Secretary held a

press conference to announce the government’s policies that

consisted of the following three pillars: (1) further diplomatic

efforts to ease tensions in the Middle East and stabilize the

situation; (2) thorough implementation of navigation safety

measures, including close information sharing with relevant

industries; and (3) commencement of specifi c studies on the

use of SDF assets to strengthen information gathering posture.

On the same day, in response to these policies, the Minister

of Defense issued an instruction on the implementation of

studies on the dispatch of MSDF vessels for the purpose of

information gathering and on the possibility of utilizing the

existing counter-piracy unit.

Following these instructions, the MOD held discussions

on specifi c matters while coordinating with the Cabinet

Secretariat, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MOFA) and

other relevant ministries and agencies.


On December 27, following the above studies and the

discussions held subsequently among the National Security

Council, the Prime Minister, and other relevant ministers, the

Cabinet decided on the government’s policy on the efforts to

ensure the safety of Japan-related vessels (details are given in

the next section). While the information gathering activities

could have been implemented within the scope of the MOD’s

jurisdiction, it was decided to carry out a Cabinet decision

not just because comprehensive measures were to be taken

under cooperation of different ministries and agencies as a

whole-of-government approach, but also in order to clarify

the importance of the deployment of the SDF overseas and

ensure accountability to the public. For the same reasons, it

was stipulated that the Diet is to receive a report whenever a

Cabinet decision regarding the activities is made (including

any changes to it) and a report on the results of such activities

upon termination. At the time of the Cabinet decision, the

report to the Diet was made immediately after the Cabinet

decision was issued.

Following the Cabinet decision on the same day, the

Minister of Defense instructed the MOD to begin various

preparations, including preparations for the formation of

units and education and training. With the participation of

the relevant departments of the MOD and other relevant

ministries and agencies, the MSDF took all possible

measures to ensure the smooth execution of its activities,

such as conducting a wargaming exercise on January 8 and 9,

2020, in order to strengthen the capabilities of commanders

**❷ [Outline of the Government’s Efforts to Ensure the Safety of Japan-Related Vessels in the Middle East (Cabinet Decision)]**


The Cabinet decision titled “The Government’s Efforts to

Ensure the Safety of Japan-Related Vessels in the Middle

East” stipulates that the government will promote its own

efforts to ensure peace and stability in the Middle East and the


safety of Japan-related vessels, such as: (1) further diplomatic

efforts to ease tensions and stabilize the situation in the

Middle East; (2) the thorough implementation of navigation

safety measures, including close information sharing with


From the start of the information gathering activity to the end of May 2020, no Japan-related vessels have been reported to encounter a distinctive event in the waters of operation. During
this period, in the waters of operation, Deployment Surface Force for Counter Piracy Enforcement (DSPE) confirmed about 7,617 vessels in total, and DAPE confirmed about 9,150 vessels

relevant industries; and (3) the use of SDF vessels and

aircraft to strengthen information gathering capabilities. The

Cabinet decision was made with an understanding of the

signifi cance of these measures, which are to be carried out

by the following means.


**2 Thorough implementation of navigation safety measures**


Japan will thoroughly implement its navigation safety

measures, including meticulous information sharing with

related industries. Specifi cally, a system of cooperation

within the government and between the government and

related industries will be established, which will also cover

the sharing of information obtained through the SDF’s

information gathering activities by related ministries and

agencies. In addition, whenever information that suggests

the existence of a risk to the safe navigation of vessels

is obtained, the government will promptly share such

information with related industries to call for vigilance in a

timely manner, encouraging them to thoroughly implement

navigation safety measures at their own initiative.

**3 Information gathering activities by the SDF**


**1 Further diplomatic efforts**

Japan has built good relations with countries involved in

the stability of the Middle East, such as maintaining good

relations with Iran for many years while being an ally of the

United States. Taking advantage of these relations, Japan will

make further diplomatic efforts, including reaching out to the

countries concerned at various levels, to ease tensions and

stabilize the situation in the Middle East. In addition, Japan

will continue to seek cooperation from the coastal countries

that play an important role in the safe navigation of vessels.

Continued efforts will be made to gain the understanding of

the countries concerned in the region regarding the SDF’s

information gathering activities.


Although there is no immediate need to implement

protective measures for Japan-related vessels in the Middle


-----

(4) Responding to Unforeseen Circumstances Or Other
Changes in the Situation

In the event of unforeseen circumstances or other changes
in the situation, the relevant ministries and agencies will
work together to understand the situation, share information
closely and promptly with each other, and strengthen the
government’s response. Then, if further measures by the
SDF are deemed necessary in response to the situation in
question, Maritime Security Operations will be ordered in
accordance with Article 82 of the Self-Defense Forces Law.
When issuing such an order, the MOD will make best efforts
for prompt decision making.

The measures that can be taken in the course of Maritime

Security Operations will be based on international laws,

including the flag state principle, and will vary depending

on the circumstances, such as whether the protected vessel

is a Japanese or foreign-flagged vessel and the type of

infringement.

**(5) Ensuring the Safety of the SDF Units**

In conducting information gathering activities, the SDF units

take all possible measures to ensure their own safety, including

the collection of sufficient information on the situation in the

areas of operation, the installation of equipment necessary to

ensure safety, and appropriate prior education and training.


East, given the rising tensions in the region, it is necessary

to strengthen the information gathering system to ensure the

safety of Japan-related vessels. Therefore, Japan has decided

to have the SDF conduct information gathering activities,

considering the distance from Japan to the Middle East

region, the SDF’s experience in operating in the region, and

the importance of cooperation with units and organizations

from other countries.

The SDF’s information gathering activities are part of

the government’s navigation safety measures and are aimed

at collecting information necessary to ensure the safety of

Japan-related vessels. The activities are to be conducted in

accordance with the provisions of Article 4, paragraph (1),

item (xviii) of the Act for Establishment of the Ministry of

Defense, as they would need smooth decision making and

order issuance in relation to Maritime Security Operations

as measures for unforeseen circumstances or other changes

in the situation, which are provided in Article 82 of the Self
Defense Forces Law.

**(1) Information to Be Gathered**


**Chapter**


The SDF will gather information that directly affects or is

necessary for ensuring safe navigation in the waters described

in (3) below.

**(2) Equipment**


After necessary adjustments, one new destroyer will be

dispatched. In addition, the SDF will also use fixed-wing

patrol aircraft P-3C of the units currently engaged in the

Counter-Piracy Operations under Article 7, paragraph (1)

of the Acts on Punishment of and Measures against Acts of

Piracy (Anti-Piracy Measures Act). Information gathering

activities by the counter-piracy units will be carried out to

an extent that does not interfere with the counter-piracy

operation.

**(3) Geographical Scope of Activities**


**(6) Cooperation among Relevant Ministries and Agencies**

In order to ensure the effectiveness of information gathering

activities and responses to changes in the situation including

the rise of unforeseen circumstances, relevant ministries and

agencies will work closely together to share understanding

regarding such responses, improve response capabilities

through training, and develop a system that allows for a

prompt response to the situation.

**(7) Cooperation with Other Countries**

Although Japan does not participate in any specific

framework related to the safety of navigation in the Middle

East and the SDF’s information gathering activities are to be

conducted at its own initiative, Japan will communicate and

cooperate with other countries as necessary.


The geographical scope of the information gathering activities

by destroyers and fixed-wing patrol aircraft described in (2)

consists of three waters of high seas: the Gulf of Oman, the

northern Arabian Sea, and the Gulf of Aden to the east of

the Bab el-Mandeb Strait (including the exclusive economic

zones of the coastal states). For resupply, destroyers will call

at a port facing the three seas.


-----

**(8) Duration of the SDF’s Activities**

The period during which the SDF should engage in the

information gathering activities (including preparation

and training periods) under the Cabinet decision is from

December 27, 2019, to December 26, 2020. If it is deemed

necessary to extend the SDF’s activities based on the Cabinet

decision, another Cabinet decision or any changes to it will

be made in that regard. If, prior to the expiration of the above

period, the SDF’s activities are no longer deemed necessary

in light of the necessity described in this paragraph,[2] the

SDF will terminate such activities at that point. If there is

a noticeable change in the situation, the National Security

Council will consider a response.

**VOICE** Response from Relevant Industries to the Information Gathering Activities in the Middle East

Based on a cabinet decision made in December 2019, the SDF has been carrying out information gathering activities in the

Middle East. In this Column, we introduce responses from the relevant industries (The Japanese Shipowners’ Association, the

Petroleum Association of Japan and the All Japan Seamen's Union ) to the activities.

Mr. NAITO Tadaaki, (President, the Japanese Shipowners’ Association)

The Japanese Shipowners’ Association welcomes the initiative of the Government of Japan

that was approved by the cabinet on December 27,2019. As tension has been rising in the

Middle East since last year, crew members of ships navigating the waters are conducting

operations with concern about safety. In this situation, the provision of information obtained by

the SDF will contribute to the safe navigation of Japanese merchant vessels and increase the

sense of security for crew members. The ocean shipping industry will closely share

Mr. NAITO Tadaaki, (President, the Japanese

information with the government to fulfi ll our social responsibility to surely transport goods Shipowners’ Association)

necessary for Japan.

Mr. TSUKIOKA Takashi (President, the Petroleum Association of Japan)

I would like to express my gratitude for the initiative by the government for the safety of

the navigation in the Middle East waters, which is an artery for energy supply to the country,

as well as the SDF personnel who are gathering information in the fi eld. Crude oil from the

Middle East accounts for about 90% of the crude oil imports of Japan. The industry believes

that safe navigation in the region is the foundation for Japan’s stable energy supply and the

peace of people’s daily lives. The industry will continue to work for the stable supply of

Mr. MORITA Yasumi (President, All Japan Seamen’s Union)

As Japan, an ocean trade nation, transports 99.6% of export/import cargoes that are

necessary for the maintenance of daily lives of its people and economic development by sea,

in order to maintain stable marine transport, the safety of navigation is absolutely vital. We

seamen can work in relief when the safety of the sea and waterways is confi rmed.

On behalf of seamen, I would like to offer my genuine appreciation for activities by people

explained the SDF’s information gathering activities and

asked Iran to cooperate as a coastal country to ensure the

safety of navigation.

In January, Prime Minister Abe visited Saudi Arabia, the

**Japan-U.S. Alliance**
###### 2


This year marked the 60th anniversary of the signing of the

Japan-U.S. Security Treaty. The National Defense Program

Guidelines for FY2019 and beyond (NDPG) states that the

Japan-U.S. Security Arrangements based on the Japan-U.S.

Security Treaty, as well as Japan’s own national defense

architecture, constitute a cornerstone for Japan’s national

security, and that the Japan-U.S. Alliance, with the Japan
U.S. Security Arrangements as its core, plays a signifi cant

role for peace, stability and prosperity of not only Japan but

also the Indo-Pacifi c region and the international community.

The NDPG also explains that, as inter-state competitions

prominently emerge, it has become all the more important for

Japan’s national security to further strengthen relationship

with the United States, with whom Japan shares universal

values and strategic interests, and that the United States

also views that cooperation with its allies has become more

important.

On that basis, the NDPG provides that, while the

Japan-U.S. Alliance has been reinforced through activities


including those that were made possible by the Legislation

for Peace and Security, Japan needs to further enhance the

Alliance through efforts under the “Guidelines for Japan
U.S. Defense Cooperation” in order to achieve its national

defense objective as security environment surrounding

Japan becomes more severe and uncertain at remarkably fast

speeds.

At the same time, the NDPG provides that, in further

strengthening the Japan-U.S. Alliance, it is an essential

premise that Japan strengthens its own defense capability on

its own accord and initiative. Fulfi lling this premise, Japan

needs to press ahead with efforts such as: bolstering the

ability of the Alliance to deter and counter threats; enhancing

and expanding cooperation in a wide range of areas; and

steadily implementing measures concerning the stationing of

the U.S. Forces in Japan (USFJ).

This chapter explains activities related to the enhancement

of the Japan-U.S. Alliance while taking account of the

concept of the NDPG.


**Chapter**


**Section** **Outline of the Japan-U.S. Security Arrangements**

**❶ [Significance of the Japan-U.S. Security Arrangements]**


centered on the Security Arrangements with the world’s

dominant military power, the United States, with which it

shares basic values such as democracy, respect for human

rights, the rule of law, and a capitalist economy as well as an

interest in maintaining the peace and security of the world,

and has strong economic ties.

Specifi cally, Japan and the United States will take bilateral

action in the event of an armed attack against Japan, based

on Article 5 of the Japan-U.S. Security Treaty, and Japan

will provide facilities and areas for the U.S. Forces, based on

Article 6 of the treaty. If a nation plans to attack Japan, the

attacker must be prepared to confront not only the defense

capability of the Self-Defense Forces (SDF), but also the

overwhelming military strength of the United States, due to

the U.S. obligation to defend Japan in the event of an armed


**1** Maintenance of Japan’s Peace and Security

In the current international community, a robust defense

system capable of responding to every contingency, ranging

from all types of armed attacks, including the use of nuclear

weapons, to coercion or intimidation by military power, is

necessary to secure the peace, security, and sovereignty of

the nation.

However, it is diffi cult even for the United States to

guarantee its security on its own. Much more than that, it

would be diffi cult for Japan to ensure its national security

solely through its unilateral efforts given its population,

land, and economy. Moreover, such a strategy would not

necessarily contribute to regional stability.

Consequently, Japan has maintained its peace and security,

attack. As a result, the opposing nation clearly recognizes

that it will suffer grievously if it carries out an invasion, and

such desires will be abandoned at the planning stage. In other

words, this serves as deterrence against attacks.

Japan intends to create a seamless posture and secure its

peace and security by effectively utilizing the deterrence

capabilities of the U.S. military together with Japan’s own

national defense architecture.

**2** Maintenance of Peace and Stability in the Region
surrounding Japan

(September 2019) 【Website of Prime Minister’s Office of Japan】

between Japan and the United States, not only in defense but

also in a wide range of areas, including politics, economy,

and society.

The Japan-U.S. Alliance, with the Japan-U.S. Security

Arrangements at its core, also forms the axis of Japan’s foreign

policy. It contributes to Japan’s ability to implement positive

efforts to maintain the peace and security of the international

community, including the promotion of multinational

security dialogue and cooperation, and cooperation with the

United Nations.

Currently, we are confronted with global security

challenges that are diffi cult for any single country to tackle

alone, including risks concerning stable use of the seas,

outer space and cyberspace, the acts of piracy, proliferation

of weapons of mass destruction and ballistic missiles, and

international terrorism, and it is important for countries to

work together from peacetime. The strong bonds forged

between Japan and the United States are also playing an

important role in the efforts implemented by Japan to

effectively respond to such challenges.

In particular, under the Japan-U.S. Security Arrangements,

the SDF and the U.S. Forces are working together in peacetime

in a variety of areas to strengthen their cooperation. This close

coordination lays the foundation for various forms of global

collaboration such as antipiracy, undertaken by the SDF and

the U.S. Forces, and leads to enhancement of the operational

effectiveness of the Japan-U.S. Security Arrangements.

The peace and prosperity of the international community

are closely linked to those of Japan. Accordingly, by advancing

initiatives for resolving global issues in cooperation with the

United States, which has remarkable operational capabilities,

Japan will be able to further ensure its security and prosperity.


Article 6 of the Japan-U.S. Security Treaty states that

contributing to the security of Japan and the maintenance of

international peace and security in the Far East is the purpose

of the use of facilities and areas by the USFJ. This provision

is based on the recognition that the security of Japan is

closely tied to the peace and security of the Far East region

to which Japan belongs.

In the regions surrounding Japan, there are many states and

the like with massive military power, including some states

that retain nuclear weapons or continue nuclear development.

In addition, uncertainty over the existing order is increasing

due to changes in the balance of power. The so-called gray
zone situations harbor the risk of rapidly developing into

graver situations without showing clear indications.

In such a security environment, the military presence of

USFJ provides deterrence against unexpected contingencies

caused by various security issues or destabilizing factors, not

only protecting the interests of Japan and the United States

but also providing a great sense of security to the nations in

the region and thus fulfi lling a role as public goods.

Also, the close bonds of cooperation based on the Japan
U.S. Security Arrangements constitute the foundation of

the United States’ commitment to the peace and stability

of the region surrounding Japan. These arrangements,

complemented by the alliances established between the

United States and other countries in the region such as the

Republic of Korea (ROK), Australia, Thailand, and the

Philippines, and also by the friendly relations developed with

other countries, play an indispensable role in maintaining the

peace and stability of the region.

**Chapter**


The Japan-U.S. Security Arrangements are the foundation

for a comprehensive and friendly cooperative relationship


-----

**❷ [Background to the Strengthening of the Alliance]**


Since the conclusion of the Japan-U.S. Security Treaty in

1960, Japan and the United States have built a robust alliance

based on democratic ideals, respect for human rights, and the

rule of law and common interests.

During the Cold War era, the Japan-U.S. Security

Arrangements ensured the safety of Japan as a country of

liberal democracy and contributed to the peace and stability

in the region, including the formulation of the Guidelines

for Japan-U.S. Defense Cooperation (“Guidelines”) in 1978

with a focus on responses to an armed attack on Japan.

Following the end of the Cold War, the leaders of Japan and

the United States announced the Japan-U.S. Joint Declaration

on Security in 1996, reaffirming the importance of the Japan
U.S. Alliance in light of the state of affairs in the Asia-Pacific

region following the Cold War. Upon the Declaration, the

final report was compiled at the Special Action Committee

on Okinawa (SACO) at the end of the same year. As part

of the promotion of cooperative relations presented in the

Declaration, the Japan-United States Security Consultative

Committee (SCC) (“2+2” Meeting) held in the following

year (1997) approved the aforementioned 1997 Guidelines[1]

and expanded cooperation to responses in situations in

areas surrounding Japan in light of changes in the security

environment, such as the end of the Cold War.

In light of further changes to the security environment due

to the 9/11 terrorist attacks in 2001 and the proliferation of

weapons of mass destruction, following the “2+2” Meeting in

December 2002, Japan and the United States held working
level and other consultations as a part of bilateral strategic

dialogue on security from the perspective of how to make

the Japan-U.S. Alliance’s capacity more effective to adapt to

the changing times.

As a result of a number of these Japan-U.S. consultations,

the direction of the Japan-U.S. Alliance was arranged in three

stages. These stages are: confirmation of common strategic

objectives to both countries, including enhancing peace and

stability of the Asia-Pacific region (first stage) in February

2005; announcement of the results of the examination of

the roles, missions, and capabilities of Japan and the United

States for accomplishing the common strategic objectives

(second stage) in October 2005; and finalization of the United

States-Japan Roadmap for Realignment Implementation

(Realignment Roadmap), a program for implementing


specific measures for the realignment of USFJ, (third stage)

in May 2006.

See Reference 16 (United States-Japan Roadmap for Realignment

Implementation [tentative translation])

See


Japan and the United States at the “2+2” Meeting in

May 2007 reconfirmed and updated their common strategic

objectives. In February 2009, based on the Realignment

Roadmap the two countries signed the Agreement between

the Government of Japan and the Government of the United

States of America Concerning the Implementation of the

Relocation of III Marine Expeditionary Force Personnel

and Their Dependents from Okinawa to Guam (the Guam

International Agreement), which entered into force in May

2009.

At the “2+2” Meeting in June 2011, the two countries

reviewed and revalidated their common strategic objectives

set forth in the Joint Statements of the previous “2+2”

Meetings, including maintenance of maritime security

domain by defending the principle of freedom of navigation

and maintenance of bilateral cooperation with respect to

protection of and access to outer space and cyberspace, and

discussed a diverse range of areas, including an expansion of

information sharing and joint intelligence, surveillance, and

reconnaissance (ISR) activities.

In the Joint Statement of the “2+2” Meeting in April 2012,

Japan and the United States announced the decision to adjust

the plans outlined in the Realignment Roadmap of 2006,

considering significant progress on the realignment of the

USFJ since the “2+2” Meeting in June 2011 as well as the

security environment in the Asia-Pacific region.

See Reference 17 (Joint Statement of the Security Consultative

Committee (2+2) [tentative translation] (April 27, 2012)

Since the formulation of the 1997 Guidelines, various

issues and destabilizing factors have emerged, and become

more visible and aggravated in the security environment

surrounding Japan; such as more active military activities of

neighboring countries, new threats including international

terrorist organizations and risks against the stable use of

global commons such as oceans, outer space and cyberspace.

In addition, the activities of the SDF have expanded to

a global scale, as exemplified by anti-piracy activities,

peacekeeping operations (PKO), and international disaster

relief activities. As a result, it had become necessary for the

manner of Japan-U.S. defense cooperation to be adapted to

or any other situation that may require an Alliance response.

Based on the framework shown in Fig. III-2-1-4, this

mechanism coordinates policy and operational aspects

related to activities conducted by the SDF and the U.S.

Forces in all phases from peacetime to contingencies. This

mechanism also contributes to timely information sharing

as well as to the development and maintenance of common

situational awareness.

The characteristics of the mechanism include that (1) it is

the standing mechanism utilizable from peacetime; (2) it can

be utilized for large-scale natural disasters in Japan as well

as for cooperation in the Asia-Pacific region and globally;

and (3) it enables whole-of-government coordination while

ensuring the involvement of relevant Japanese and U.S.

organizations. These characteristics enable the Japanese and

U.S. Governments to respond appropriately and promptly

when the need for coordination arises. For example,

in the event of a largescale natural disaster in Japan, it

would require a diversity of coordination in the policy and

operational aspects related to activities of the SDF and the

U.S. Forces. The utilization of this mechanism makes it

possible to conduct close and appropriate coordination with

the involvement of relevant Japanese and U.S. organizations

at various levels.

Since the establishment of the mechanism, Japan and the

and Chinese activities in the waters and airspace around the

Senkaku Islands.

See Fig. III-2-1-3 (The Framework of Alliance Coordination

Mechanism [ACM])


(2) Enhanced Operational Coordination

Based on the Guidelines, the Japanese and U.S. Governments

recognize the importance of collocating operational

coordination functions. The SDF and the U.S. Forces will

exchange personnel to ensure robust information sharing, to

facilitate coordination and to support international activities.

(3) Establishment of the Bilateral Planning Mechanism (BPM)

Based on the Guidelines, the Japanese and U.S. Governments

established the BPM in November 2015 for the purpose

of implementing the development of bilateral plans in

peacetime in line with the Guidelines in order to enable

effective bilateral responses to contingencies relevant to

Japan’s peace and security.

In the development of bilateral plans, this mechanism

performs the functions of ensuring Ministerial-level

directions and supervision and the involvement of relevant

cooperate in international activities and promote and improve
trilateral and multilateral cooperation for regional and global
peace and security; to make cooperation on space and
cyberspace; and to develop and enhance bilateral enterprise
through defense equipment and technology cooperation as
well as intelligence cooperation and information security for

2. Meetings are held from time to time between working-level officials of the two Governments, such as officials corresponding in rank to vice-minister or assistant secretary.
3. A Council of Deputies consisting of Deputy-Director General and Deputy Assistant Secretaries was established when the SDC was recognized on June 28, 1996.


**Chapter**


Japanese Minister of Defense and the U.S. Secretary of

Defense as necessary where discussions are made with a

focus on the defense policies of the respective governments

and defense cooperation. Furthermore, the Japanese State

Minister of Defense and the U.S. Deputy Secretary of

Defense work together, and MOD officials, including the

Administrative Vice-Minister of Defense, the Chief of

Staff of the Joint Staff, the Vice-Minister of Defense for

International Affairs, and the Chiefs of Staff of the SDF,

have working-level meetings when necessary and exchange

information with the U.S. Department of Defense (DoD) and

others under the Japan-U.S. Security Arrangements.

The sharing of information and views at every

opportunity and level between Japan and the United States


is undoubtedly conducive to the increased credibility of

the Japan-U.S. Security Arrangements, and results in the

further enhancement of close collaboration between the two

countries. Therefore, the MOD is proactively engaging in

these initiatives.

**Section** **Strengthening Ability of Japan-U.S. Alliance to Deter and Counter Threats**
**2**


The NDPG provides that, for strengthening the ability of the

Japan-U.S. Alliance to deter and counter threats, in all stages

from peacetime to armed contingencies as well as during

disasters, Japan will enhance information sharing with

the United States, conduct effective and smooth bilateral

coordination involving all relevant organizations and take all

necessary measures to ensure Japan’s peace and security.

For these purposes, Japan will further deepen various

operational cooperation and policy coordination with the

**❶ [Cooperation in Space and Cyber Domains]**


United States. In particular, Japan will expand and deepen

cooperation in: space and cyber domains; comprehensive air

and missile defense; bilateral training and exercises; bilateral

ISR operations; and bilateral fl exible deterrent options. Japan

will also promote development and update of bilateral plans

and deepen the Extended Deterrence Dialogue. In addition,

Japan will even more actively conduct activities such as

logistic support for U.S. force activities and protection of

U.S. ships and aircraft.

**1 Cooperation on Space**

With regard to cooperation on space, based on the agreement

at the Japan-U.S. Summit Meeting in November 2009 to

promote cooperation in the area of space security as part

of initiatives to deepen the Japan-U.S. Alliance, the two

countries have periodically been working together to discuss

how they should cooperate in the future, such as the holding

of the 1st Japan-U.S. Space Security Dialogue in September

2010 with the participation of relevant ministries and

agencies.

Furthermore, the Japan-U.S. Summit Meeting in April

2012 decided to deepen the space-based partnership for civil

and security purposes and to create a whole-of government

comprehensive dialogue on space, enabling relevant

ministries and agencies to hold the 1st whole-of government

Japan-U.S. Comprehensive Dialogue on Space in March

2013. The two countries have been sharing information on

their respective space policies and discussing plans for future

cooperation on a regular basis.

Moreover, based on the instructions given by the Japan
U.S. Defense Ministerial Meeting of April 2015, the two

countries established the Space Cooperation Working Group

(SCWG) to further promote the cooperation among bilateral

defense authorities in the area of space. The SCWG has held

six meetings in total since its establishment in October 2015

(the most recent meeting was in February 2020). Going

forward, Japan and the United States will leverage this

working group to deepen discussions in a wide variety of

areas, including (1) promoting space policy dialogue, (2)

reinforcing information sharing, (3) working together to

**2 Cooperation on Cyberspace**

Concerning cooperation on cyberspace, the Cyber Defense

Policy Working Group (CDPWG) was established in October

2013 as a framework between the MOD and the DoD to

discuss a broad range of professional and concrete issues,

including the sharing of information at the policy level,

human resources development, and technical cooperation.

The Guidelines released in April 2015 and the CDPWG

Joint Statement published in May 2015 cited the prompt and

appropriate establishment of an information sharing structure

and the protection of the critical infrastructure upon which

the SDF and the U.S. Forces depend to accomplish their

missions as examples of cooperation between the Japanese

and U.S. Governments. In addition, as part of cooperation

between the SDF and the U.S. Forces, the securing of the

resiliency of their respective networks and systems and the

implementation of educational exchanges and joint exercises

were also cited. Japan and the United States will further

accelerate bilateral cyber defense cooperation in line with

the direction presented by the Guidelines and the CDPWG

Joint Statement. At the “2+2” Meeting in April 2019, Japan

and the United States agreed to strengthen cooperation

in the fi eld of cyberspace, affi rming that international law

applies in cyberspace and that a cyber attack could, in certain

circumstances, constitute an armed attack for the purposes of

Article V of the Japan-U.S. Security Treaty.

Japanese side can learn from the U.S. Forces, which have

vast experience in actual fighting, are invaluable and greatly

contribute to improving SDF capabilities.

In addition, conducting bilateral training at effective times,

places, and scales demonstrates the unified commitment and

capabilities of Japan and the United States, which has a

deterrent effect. In light of these perspectives, the MOD/SDF

is continuing its initiatives to enrich the contents of bilateral

training and exercises.

Bilateral training has been expanded not only within

Japan but also to the United States by dispatching SDF

units there. Continuous efforts are being made to enhance

interoperability and Japan-U.S. bilateral response capabilities

at the military branch and unit levels, including the Japan
U.S. bilateral regional army command post exercises, special

anti-submarine exercises, and Japan-U.S. bilateral fighter

combat training.

Since FY1985, mostly on an annual basis, command post

exercises and field training exercises have been conducted

alternately as the Japan-U.S. bilateral joint exercise. In 2020,

a command post exercise was conducted in January in the

MOD’s Ichigaya area and other locations.

As for recent training and exercises, the Ground Self
Defense Force (GSDF) and the Maritime Self-Defense Force

(MSDF) participated in a field exercise (Talisman Saber

19) with U.S. forces held in Australia from June to August

2019, which included multinational and bilateral command

and staff operations and landing exercises. In December

2019, the U.S. Army and the Marine Corps participated in

The expansion of these ISR activities will function as

deterrence capabilities, and will also ensure information

superiority over other nations and enable the establishment

of a seamless cooperation structure in all phases from

peacetime to contingencies.


With regard to bilateral ISR activities, it is important to

implement ISR activities in a broad Asia-Pacific region in

cooperation between Japan and the United States to enhance

the efficiency and effectiveness of the activities of both

countries.

Following the passage of the Legislation for Peace and

Security in September 2015, the new Japan-U.S. ACSA was

signed in September 2016, ratified by the Diet on April 14,

2017, and entered into force on April 25. This has enabled

the same framework as the existing Japan-U.S. ACSA, such

as settlement procedures, to be applied to the provision of

supplies and services that had become possible under the

Legislation for Peace and Security, so that since April 2017

food and fuel have been provided to the U.S. Forces engaged

in information collection and other activities.

See Part II, Chapter 5, Section 2-4 (Conclusion of the New Japan
U.S. Acquisition and Cross-Servicing Agreement [ACSA])

Fig. III-2-2-1 (Japan-U.S. Acquisition and Cross-Servicing
Agreement [ACSA])


Japan-U.S. cooperation is also being steadily promoted

through logistics support based on the Acquisition and Cross
Servicing Agreement (ACSA) signed in 1996 and revised

in 1999 and 2004. The Agreement is designed to positively

contribute to the smooth and effective operation under the

Japan-U.S. Security Treaty and to initiatives for international

peace taken under the leadership of the United Nations (UN).

Its scope of application includes various occasions such as

bilateral training and exercises in peacetime, disaster relief

activities, UN PKO, international disaster relief activities,

situations in areas surrounding Japan, and armed attack

situations. If either the SDF or the U.S. Forces request the

other party to provide supplies or services, the Agreement, in

principle, allows the requested party to do so.[1]


The categories of supplies and services as provided under the Agreement include: food; water; billeting; transportation (including airlift); petroleum, oils, and lubricants; clothing;
communications; medical services; base support; storage services; use of facilities; training services; spare parts and components; repair and maintenance services; airport and seaport

**❼ [Cooperation in Response to a Large-Scale Disaster in Japan]**


In the aftermath of the Great East Japan Earthquake in 2011,

the SDF and the U.S. Forces demonstrated their high-level

joint response capabilities based on the strong ties they had

developed. The success of the joint response between the

SDF and the U.S. Forces through Operation Tomodachi was

the result of Japan-U.S. Bilateral Training and Exercises over

many years, and will lead to the Alliance being deepened

further in the future. Operation Tomodachi involved the

deployment of a large-scale force at its peak, including

troops of approximately 16,000 personnel, around 15 ships,

and around 140 aircraft, resulting in relief activities that were

unprecedented in scale and contributing greatly to Japan’s

restoration and reconstruction. Not only those affected but

numerous Japanese at large were filled with a deepened sense

of appreciation and trust for the USFJ.

On the other hand, some issues have emerged, such as

clarifying the roles, missions and capabilities of Japan and

the United States in the event of a disaster within Japan,

as well as stipulating more concrete joint guidelines to

facilitate greater participation by the U.S. Forces in disaster


prevention drills, and examining mechanisms for the sharing

of information and more effective coordination mechanism.

In light of these issues, the December 2013 Response

Plan for a Massive Earthquake in the Nankai Trough listed

the Japan-U.S. Joint Response Plan, and the two countries

have conducted several bilateral comprehensive disaster

prevention exercises aimed at maintaining and enhancing

earthquake disaster handling capabilities to be demonstrated

through collaboration between the SDF, USFJ, related

ministries and agencies, and related local governments in the

event of occurrence of a Nankai Trough earthquake.

In response to the Kumamoto Earthquake in 2016,

Japan-U.S. cooperation was manifested in the form of the

transportation of daily necessities by the Osprey (MV-22)

of the U.S. Marine Corps and the transportation of SDF

personnel by C-130 transport aircraft. The ACM was utilized

on that occasion, including the Japan-U.S. Joint Coordination

Office locally established by the joint task force organized

for the earthquake response.

**Chapter**


Both Japan and the United States have made efforts as
maritime nations to maintain and develop “open and stable
seas” according to fundamental rules such as securing
the freedom and safety of navigation, and the rule of law
including peaceful dispute resolution based on international
law.
For example, Japan and the United States have worked
closely together in various multilateral maritime security
cooperation frameworks with such countries as those along
the sea lanes, including Proliferation Security Initiative (PSI)
maritime interdiction exercises. In addition, the SDF has
dispatched its offi cers to the U.S. Central Naval Command
in Bahrain to carry out intelligence gathering activities in
the Middle East, which began as a Japan-initiated activity
in 2020.
The two countries have also been working closely together
on providing multilateral capacity building in the maritime
domain to countries including those along the sea lanes.

See Chapter 3, Section 2 (Ensuring Maritime Security)
Chapter 3, Section 4-2 (International Initiatives Aimed at NonProliferation of Weapons of Mass Destruction)


Japan and the United States are promoting and enhancing
trilateral and multilateral security and defense cooperation.
The SDF is participating in trilateral (e.g., Japan-U.S.Australia, Japan-U.S.-India, and Japan-U.S.-ROK) and
multilateral training, in addition to bilateral training and

exercises between Japan and the United States.

technology to the United States regardless of the Three
Principles on Arms Exports and related guidelines. In 1983,
Japan established the Exchange of Notes concerning the
Transfer of Military Technologies to the United States of
America.[1] In 2006, the Exchange of Notes concerning the
Transfer of Arms and Military Technologies to the United
States of America[2] was established to replace the foregoing
Exchange of Notes. Under these frameworks, Japan decided
to provide the United States with 20 items of arms and
military technologies, including military technologies
related to joint technological research on BMD. Japan and
the United States consult with each other at forums such as
the Systems and Technology Forum (S&TF) and conduct
cooperative research and development regarding the specifi c
projects agreed upon at these forums.
At the Japan-U.S. Defense Ministerial Meeting in June


Japan proactively promotes cooperation in defense

diversity and efficiency of Japan-U.S. bilateral training and
exercises, and expands the scope and raises the frequency of
activities such as ISR. The SDF has only a limited number of
facilities in Okinawa, including Naha Air Base, and most of
them are located in urban areas, which results in operational
limitations. The joint/shared use of facilities and areas of the
USFJ in Okinawa will greatly improve the SDF’s training
environment in Okinawa, and facilitate implementation of
joint training and exercises and increased interoperability
between the SDF and the U.S. Forces. It will also improve
readiness and contribute to ensuring the safety of local
people in case of a disaster.
Thus, while taking into account the SDF defense posture in
the regions, including the Southwestern Islands, and relations
with local communities, Japan and the United States are
proactively engaged in consultations, and specific initiatives
are steadily progressing. For example, the GSDF has been
using Camp Hansen since March 2008 for exercises purpose.
Moreover, the relocation of the ASDF Air Defense Command
to Headquarter Yokota in April 2012 and the relocation of the
then GSDF Central Readiness Force Headquarters to Zama
in March 2013 were carried out. In addition, the development
of training ranges in Guam and the Northern Mariana Islands
(Tinian Island, Pagan Island, etc.) for shared use by the SDF
and the U.S. Forces is under consideration.

**2** Measures concerning the Stationing of the USFJ


Under the Japan-U.S. Security Arrangements, the presence
of USFJ functions as deterrence, while on the other hand,
given the impacts of the stationing of the USFJ on the living
environment of the local residents, it is necessary to make
efforts appropriate for the actual situation of each area in
order to mitigate the impacts. In particular, the realignment
of the USFJ is a very important initiative for mitigation of the

**❶ [Stationing of the USFJ]**


**Chapter**


**1** Signifi cance of the Stationing of the USFJ

Given the increasingly severe security environment
surrounding Japan, it is necessary to maintain the presence
of the USFJ and its readiness to make rapid and agile actions
in case of emergency in Japan and the surrounding areas
even in peacetime, so that Japan-U.S. Alliance based on
Japan–U.S. Security Arrangements functions enough as a
deterrent power that contributes to the peace and stability of
the defense of Japan and the region.
Therefore, Japan accepts the stationing of the U.S.
Forces based on the Japan-U.S. Security Treaty and it is a
cornerstone of Japan-U.S. Security Arrangements.
Also, it is essential to realize the stable stationing of the
USFJ in order to make a swift joint response to an armed
attack to Japan based on Article 5 of Japan-U.S. Security
Treaty. In addition, the actions of U.S. Forces for the defense
of Japan are conducted not only by the USFJ but also by
timely reinforcements. The USFJ is supposed to be the basis
for them.
While Article 5 of Japan-U.S. Security Treaty stipulates
the duty of the U.S. to defend Japan, the U.S. is granted
the use of facilities and areas in Japan based on Article 6
for the purpose of maintaining the security of Japan and
international peace and security in the Far East. Therefore,
though the duties of each side are not the same, they are
balanced overall.


The SOFA[1] stipulates matters pertaining to USFJ facilities
and areas and the status of the USFJ, including the furnishing
of facilities and areas for use by the USFJ (USFJ facilities and
areas), and satisfying the labor requirements of the USFJ. In
addition, the Supplementary Agreement on the Environment
enhances cooperation for environmental stewardship relating
to the USFJ, and the Supplementary Agreement on Civilian
Component intends to clarify the scope of the civilian
component, etc.


**（1）Furnishing of USFJ Facilities and Areas**

Japan furnishes USFJ facilities and areas under the provision
of the SOFA, in accordance with agreements reached through
the Joint Committee between the Governments of Japan and
the United States.
The Government of Japan concludes lease contracts with
owners of private and public lands on which USFJ facilities
and areas exist in order to ensure the stable use of these
facilities and areas. However, should the Government be
unable to obtain the approval of landowners, it shall acquire
title[2] under the Act on Special Measures for USFJ Land
Release,[3] compensating the landowners for any loss they
may have suffered in the process.


**（2）Satisfying Labor Requirements of the USFJ**


The SOFA stipulates that the manpower (labor) required
by the USFJ shall be satisfi ed with the assistance of the

Offi cial title: Agreement Under Article VI of the Treaty of Mutual Cooperation and Security Between Japan and the United States of America, Regarding Facilities and Areas and the Status of
United States Armed Forces in Japan

The term “title” means a legal cause that justifi es a certain act.

Government of Japan.
As of the end of FY2019, there were 25,869 USFJ local
employees (hereinafter referred to as the “employees”) at
USFJ facilities and areas throughout Japan, working as clerks
at headquarters, engineers at maintenance/supply facilities,
members of security guards and fi re departments on base,
and sales staff at welfare/recreational facilities. They support
the smooth operations of the USFJ.
The Government of Japan hires these employees in
accordance with the provisions of the SOFA. The MOD
supports the stationing of the USFJ by performing
administrative work for personnel management, payment of
wages, health care, and welfare, etc.

See Part IV, Chapter 5, Section 1-4-3 (Activities of the MOD for

Coexistence with the Environment and Society)


**（5）The Revision of the Guidelines Regarding Off-Base**
U.S. Military Aircraft Accidents

In July 2019, the Governments of Japan and the United States
agreed on the revision of the Guidelines Regarding Aircraft
Accidents in Japan.[4] This revision aims at further refi ning
the procedures for access to the site by Japanese and U.S.
Government offi cials in the event of off-base U.S. military
aircraft accidents that occur in Japan, and so on.
The major changes include clarifi cation of expeditious
early entry of USG and GOJ representatives into the inner
cordon (restricted area) designated in the event of an accident.
The revised guidelines also stipulate as follows; entry
into the site will be preferentially made by USG and GOJ
representatives with responsibilities associated with accident
site mitigation to include hazardous material observation,
the aircraft accident investigation, or claims investigations;
relevant information especially on hazardous materials will
be provided to Japanese authorities as soon as possible after
an accident; in removing wreckage that has the potential
to signifi cantly and negatively affect the condition of the
underlying Japanese property, the U.S. Forces will basically
coordinate with the landowner through the Regional Defense
Bureau of the Ministry of Defense basically; and that when
the U.S. authorities, GOJ authorities, or local authorities
conduct environmental surveys, the results will be shared
within the Joint Committee framework. These changes
enable more effective, expeditious and proper response to
future U.S. military aircraft accidents.

**（3）Supplementary Agreement on Cooperation in the**
Field of Environmental Stewardship

In September 2015, the Governments of Japan and the United
States signed and effectuated the Agreement on Cooperation
in the Field of Environmental Stewardship relating to the
USFJ, supplementary to the SOFA. This supplementary
agreement represents an international commitment with
legal binding force and sets forth provisions concerning
the issuance and maintenance of the Japan Environmental
Governing Standards (JEGS) and the establishment and
maintenance, etc. of procedures for access to USFJ facilities
and areas. This agreement was the fi rst of its kind created
to supplement the SOFA since the SOFA had entered into
force and has a historical signifi cance that differs essentially
in nature from conventional improvements in the operations
of the SOFA.


**3** Costs Associated with the USFJ


Various costs associated with the USFJ include the costs of
stationing USFJ, costs for implementing the stipulations of the
SACO Final Report for mitigating the impact on the people
of Okinawa, as well as costs for implementing measures that
contribute to mitigating the impact on local communities
associated with the initiatives for the realignment of the U.S.
Forces.

See Fig. III-2-4-1 (U.S. Forces Japan-related Costs [Budget for

FY2020])

**4** Host Nation Support (HNS)


**（4）Supplementary Agreement on Civilian Component**

In January 2017, the Governments of Japan and the United
States signed the Supplementary Agreement on Civilian
Component, which came in to force on the same day. The
agreement clarifi es the scope of the civilian component, which
is addressed only by a general provision in SOFA, develops
criteria used in evaluating contractor employee positions for
eligibility to receive designation as members of the civilian
component, and stipulates the procedures for notifi cation and
review, etc. together with the exclusion of ordinary residents
from the civilian component. The initiative to formulate the
Supplementary Agreement on Civilian Component is the
second case, following the creation of the Supplementary
Agreement on the Environment that supplements the SOFA.


HNS plays an important role to ensure the smooth and
effective implementation of the Japan-U.S. Security
Arrangements. Due to soaring prices and wages in Japan
since the mid-1970s, and changes in the international
economic situation, Japan began to bear labor costs such as

Notes 1: Training relocation costs under the Special Measures Agreement extend into the SACO-related costs and the realignment-related costs.
2: The SACO-related costs refer to the costs for implementing the contents of the SACO Final Report to reduce the impact on Okinawa, while the realignment-related
costs refer to the costs relating to measures to contribute to reducing the impact on local communities as part of the realignment initiatives. Since the cost sharing
for the stationing of USFJ is Japan’s voluntary effort to bear some costs in light of the importance of ensuring the smooth and effective implementation of the
Japan-U.S. Security Arrangements, its nature is different from the SACO-related costs and the realignment-related costs, and is categorized separately.
3: The costs for the stationing of USFJ include the MOD-related budget, other ministry-related budgets (base subsidy, etc.: ¥41.1 billion, FY2019 Budget) and the
estimated costs of government-owned land provided for use as USFJ facilities (¥164.1 billion, FY2019 Estimated Costs).
4: Numbers may not add up due to rounding.


welfare costs in FY1978. Then in FY1979, it started to bear
costs for the Facilities Improvement Program (FIP).
Furthermore, as labor costs soared due to changes in
economic conditions that affected both countries, the
employment stability of the employees would be influenced
adversely, and there was even concern that it would affect
the activities of the USFJ. Therefore, in 1987, Japan and
the United States concluded an agreement that sets forth
special measures regarding Article 24 of the SOFA (the
Special Measures Agreement)[5] as exceptional, limited and
provisional measures under the cost principle in the SOFA.
Based on this agreement, Japan started to bear labor
costs of eight categories such as the adjustment allowance
(currently replaced by the regional allowance). As the Special
Measures Agreement (SMA) was revised later on, the costs
shared by Japan expanded to cover labor costs including base
pay, and utilities costs from FY1991, and training relocation
costs from FY1996.
Japan has been reviewing HNS, paying full attention to

**❷ [Progress of the Realignment of the USFJ]**


its tight fiscal conditions, and as a result, HNS has been on a
steady decline after peaking out in the FY1999 budget on an
expenditure basis.

**5** Current Special Measures Agreement


As the former SMA was effective until the end of March
2016, the current SMA was intended to “open discussions
pertaining to future arrangements for an appropriate level
for sharing of the costs of U.S. Forces stationed in Japan”
based on the “2+2” agreement of April 2015. Following this
agreement, Japan and the United States held consultations
on a new SMA, and in December 2015, the Governments of
Japan and the United States reached agreement as follows:
Subsequently, after the current SMA was signed in January
2016 and approval by the Diet, the current agreement took
effect in April of the same year.

Subsequently, the following factors were set forth: (1)
The necessity of implementing measures to realize visible
mitigation of the impact on Okinawa promptly and steadily;
(2) The necessity of balancing the realignment package and
the strategic rebalance to the Asia-Pacific region, which was
set out in the U.S. Defense Strategic Guidance released in
January 2012; and (3) The reduction in the cost associated
with the relocation of the U.S. Marine Corps to Guam
demanded by the U.S congress. Full-fledged consultation
on the coordination of the realignment package took place
between the two countries in light of those factors. The
achievements thereof were announced as part of the Joint
Statements of the “2+2” Meeting and through other means.
The 2006 Roadmap stated that, among the III Marine
Expeditionary Force (MEF) stationed in Okinawa, the main
focus of the relocation to Guam would be the command

elements, but at the “2+2” Meeting in April 2012, the United
States decided to alter the composition of the units and to
deploy the Marine Air-Ground Task Force (MAGTF)—
consisting of command, ground, aviation and logistics
support elements—in Japan, Guam, and Hawaii, as well as
in Australia as a rotational unit. In addition, the Governments
of Japan and the United States decided to delink both the
relocation of U.S. Marine Corps personnel from Okinawa
to Guam and the resulting land returns south of Kadena Air
Base from the progress on the Futenma Replacement Facility
(FRF).

See Reference 17 (Joint Statement of the Security Consultative

Committee [tentative translation] (April 27, 2012))

Fig. III-2-4-3 (Progress of the Realignment of Force Structure
of USFJ and the SDF Described in the “United States-Japan
Roadmap for Realignment Implementation”-1)

- 

Thus, the stationing of the U.S. Forces in Okinawa,
including the U.S. Marine Corps, which can deal with a wide
range of missions with high mobility and readiness and is
in charge of first response for a variety of contingencies,
with the above-mentioned geographical characteristics,
further ensures the effectiveness of the Japan-U.S. Alliance,
strengthens deterrence, and contributes greatly not only to
the security of Japan but also to the peace and stability of the
Asia-Pacific region.
On the other hand, Okinawa has many USFJ facilities and
areas such as air bases, maneuver areas and logistics facilities.
As of January 1, 2020, approximately 70% of USFJ facilities
and areas (for exclusive use) are concentrated in Okinawa
Prefecture, occupying approximately 8% of the land area of
the prefecture and approximately 14% of the main island of
Okinawa. Therefore, it is necessary to make utmost efforts to


In comparison to areas such as the U.S. mainland, Hawaii,
and Guam, Okinawa is located closer to potential conflict
areas that could affect Japan’s peace and security, including
the Korean Peninsula and the Taiwan Strait, but at the same
time has the advantage of having a certain distance from
these areas that would not heighten military tension there
unnecessarily. In addition, Okinawa, comprising a large
number of small islands, is located roughly in the center of the
Southwestern Islands having a total length of some 1,200 km
and close to key sea lanes for Japan, which depends on marine
transportation for over 99% of its overall international trade.
Furthermore, its location is extremely important from the
perspective of security, as Okinawa serves as a strategically
important target for neighboring countries in both making
access to the Pacific from the continent and rejecting access
from the Pacific to the continent.

on those subject to the strong local requests, and, in relation
to the so-called 23 issues, it was agreed in 1990 that both
sides would proceed with the required coordination and
procedures toward the return of land. Moreover, it was
agreed in 1995 that initiatives would also be made to resolve
the so-called Three Okinawa Issues,[6] including the return of
Naha Port (Naha City).
Subsequently, in response to an unfortunate incident that
occurred in 1995, as well as the refusal of the then Governor of
Okinawa to sign land lease renewal documents under the Act
on Special Measures for USFJ Land Release, the Government
of Japan decided to devote even greater initiatives towards
realignment, consolidation, and reduction, believing that
the impact should be shared by the whole nation. In order
to hold consultations on issues related to USFJ facilities and
areas in Okinawa, the Government of Japan established the
Okinawa Action Council between the central government
and Okinawa Prefecture, and SACO between Japan and the
United States, and the so-called SACO Final Report was
compiled in 1996.


regarding the SOFA procedures, and also refers to the related
facilities and areas covered. The land to be returned based on
the SACO Final Report represents approximately 21% (about
50 km[2]) of USFJ facilities and areas in Okinawa at that time,
exceeding the amount of land returned during the period
between the reversion of Okinawa and the implementation
of the SACO Final Report, which is roughly 43 km[2].

Report [image]);

Facilities and Areas [Exclusive Use] in Okinawa)

**3** Return of a Major Portion of the Northern Training Area


The condition for returning the Northern Training Area
was to relocate seven helipads in the area to be returned
to the preexisting training area. However, the Government
of Japan reached an agreement with the U.S. side to give
considerations for the natural environment and to relocate
not all seven but the minimum number of six helipads
necessary, and proceeded with the construction work. The
relocation of the helipads completed in December 2016, and
the return of approximately 4,000 ha, a major portion of the
Northern Training Area located in the villages of Kunigami
and Higashi, was achieved based on the SACO Final Report.
The returned land accounts for approximately 20% of
USFJ facilities and areas (for exclusive use) in Okinawa. The
return is the largest one since the reversion of Okinawa to the
mainland, and had been an issue for 20 years since the SACO
Final Report in 1996.

**4** Relocation and Return of MCAS Futenma


V-shape configuration that combines Henokosaki and
adjacent water areas of Oura and Henoko Bays.” With regard
to construction of this replacement facility, “a Memorandum
of Basic Understanding” was exchanged between the then
Governor of Okinawa Inamine and the then Minister of State
for Defense Nukaga in May 2006.
After the change of government in September 2009,
the Exploratory Committee for Okinawa Base Issues was
established. After reviews conducted by the Committee,
both governments, at the “2+2” Meeting held in May 2010,
confirmed the intention to locate the FRF in the Camp
Schwab Henokosaki area and the adjacent waters, and
decided that a study by experts regarding the replacement
facility's location, configuration and construction method
would be completed promptly. The two sides also agreed to
take concrete measures to mitigate the impact on Okinawa.
Subsequently, at the “2+2” Meeting held in June 2011, it was
decided that the runway would take a “V” shape.
During the deliberation process which led to these
conclusions, first of all, it was determined that, from a security
perspective, the deterrence of the U.S. Forces, including
that of the U.S. Marine Corps stationed in Okinawa that is
located in a crucial area for the security of Japan, cannot be
lessened while there remains instability and uncertainty in
the security environment in East Asia. Furthermore, concern
was expressed that the functions of the U.S. Marine Corps
such as mobility and readiness would be weakened if the
helicopter units stationed at MCAS Futenma were to be
detached from the other Marine units stationed in Okinawa
and moved abroad or out of the prefecture. Therefore, it was
concluded that the FRF had to be located within Okinawa
Prefecture.
Also at the “2+2” Meetings in April 2012, October 2013,
April 2015, August 2017, and April 2019, and in other
instances including the joint statement issued at the JapanU.S. Summit Meeting in February 2017, the Governments
of Japan and the United States confirmed that the plan to
construct the FRF at Camp Schwab Henokosaki area and
adjacent waters is the only solution that avoids the continued
use of MCAS Futenma.

See Reference 26 (Background of the Futenma Replacement

Facility);

Reference 27 (Estimated Timelines for the Return of Facilities
and Areas South of Kadena);

Fig. III-2-4-8 (Comparison between the Replacement Facility
and MCAS Futenma [image])


Along with the initiatives set forth in the Roadmap related
to the realignment of the U.S. Forces, measures have been
implemented to alleviate the impact on the local communities
in Okinawa while maintaining the deterrence capabilities.
The Government of Japan believes that it is imperative
not to allow MCAS Futenma to remain indefinitely at its
current location, which is in the vicinity of houses, schools,
etc. in the center of Ginowan City, Okinawa Prefecture, and
considers that this is a fundamental idea shared between the
Government of Japan and the people of Okinawa.
As for the relocation of MCAS Futenma, the Government
of Japan has not changed its stance that the current plan to
construct the FRF at the Camp Schwab Henokosaki area
(Nago City) and adjacent waters is the only solution to avoid
the continued use of MCAS Futenma.
The Government of Japan will make further efforts to
achieve the relocation and return of MCAS Futenma as
early as possible and to mitigate the impact on Okinawa in a
speedy manner. The return of MCAS Futenma is expected to
eliminate danger in the area and to contribute to the further
growth of Okinawa, including Ginowan City, through the
reuse of the area (approximately 476 ha with a land area 100
times larger than Tokyo Dome).


**Chapter**


**（1）Background Concerning the Futenma Replacement**
Facility

Considering the occurrence of the U.S. Forces helicopter
crash in Ginowan City in August 2004, bilateral discussions
on the realignment have been made towards realizing the
relocation and return of MCAS Futenma at the earliest
possible date in order to resolve the concern of the residents
living in the vicinity.
In the SCC (“2+2”) document compiled in October 2005,
the initiative to “locate the FRF in ‘L’-shaped configuration
that combines the shoreline areas of Camp Schwab and
adjacent water areas of Oura Bay” was approved. However,
since this L-shape meant that U.S. military aircraft would fly
over settlements in Nago City and Ginoza Village, a request
was submitted to avoid flights over these settlements. In
light of this, based on negotiation and agreement with the
local municipalities including Nago City, it was decided
to stipulate in the Roadmap that the FRF be located in a

than merely moving the facility from one location to another.
Rather, it involves reduction in the base’s functions and area
in Okinawa, and contributes greatly to mitigating the impact
on Okinawa.
a. Distribution of Functions Offered by MCAS Futenma

MCAS Futenma fulfills the following functions relating to
the aviation capabilities of the U.S. Marine Corps stationed
in Okinawa: (1) Operation of the Osprey and other aircraft;
(2) Operation of air refueling aircraft; and (3) Accepting
transient aircraft in contingencies. Of these three functions,

only (1) “operation of the Osprey and other aircraft” will
be relocated to Camp Schwab. As for (2) “operation of air
refueling aircraft,” all 15 KC-130 air refueling aircraft were
relocated to MCAS Iwakuni (in Iwakuni City, Yamaguchi
Prefecture) in August 2014.
This marked the completion of a task that has remained
unresolved for 18 years since the SACO Final Report in
1996, enabling a vast majority of fixed-wing aircraft located
in MCAS Futenma to be moved outside Okinawa Prefecture.
This move also led to the relocation of approximately 870
USFJ personnel, civilian employees, and dependents.
Moreover, the function of (3) “accepting transient aircraft
in contingencies” will also be transferred to Tsuiki Air Base
and Nyutabaru Air Base. In October 2018, Japan and the
United States agreed on developing facilities that would be
necessary for relocating the function, and related work such
as construction of the facilities has been carried out.
b. Reduction in Area

The area required for the land reclamation to build the


FRF is approximately 150 ha, less than one-third of the
approximately 476 ha of MCAS Futenma, and the new
facility will be equipped with a significantly shorter runway
at 1,200 m (1,800 m including the overruns) compared to the
current runway length of 2,740 m at MCAS Futenma.
c. Reduction in Noise and Risks

Two runways will be constructed in a V-shape, which enables
the flight path for both takeoff and landing to be located over
the sea, in line with the requests of the local community. In
MCAS Futenma, flight paths used daily for training and other

purposes are located over residential areas, whereas flight
paths in the FRF will be changed to over the sea, thereby
reducing noise and risks.
For example, while more than 10,000 households are
located in areas requiring housing noise insulation near
MCAS Futenma, there will be zero households requiring
such insulation around the FRF. This means that the noise
levels experienced by all households will comply with the
environment criteria applied to exclusive housing areas. In
the case that an aircraft encounters any contingency, safety on
the ground can be ensured by diverting the aircraft offshore.


**（3）The Necessity of Constructing the Futenma**
Replacement Facility within Okinawa Prefecture

The U.S. Marine Corps in Okinawa consists of air, ground,
logistics, and command elements. The interaction of those
elements is indispensable for U.S. Marine Corps operations
characterized by great mobility and readiness, so the FRF
needs to be located within Okinawa Prefecture so that rotary

wing aircraft stationed at MCAS Futenma will be located
near the elements with which they train, operate, or otherwise
work on a regular basis.


immediately suspended the land-fill work while the Minister
of Land, Infrastructure, Transport and Tourism issued an
instruction for correction based on the Local Autonomy
Act to then Governor Onaga to repeal the revocation of
the land-fill permit. Subsequently, in December 2016, after
examination by the Central and Local Government Dispute
Management Council and deliberation by the Naha Branch
of the Fukuoka High Court, the Supreme Court set forth the
decision that the revocation of the land-fill permit by then
Governor Onaga was illegal.
b. Judgment of the Supreme Court

In the judgment, the Supreme Court ruled that then Governor
Nakaima’s decision was not illegal. The court stated that no
circumstances could be found indicating that then Governor
Nakaima’s decision that the landfill was in compliance with
the condition in Article 4 (1) (i) of the Act on Reclamation
of Publicly-owned Water Surface, “that it is appropriate and
reasonable as the use of national land,” had no foundation
in fact, or clearly lacked reasoning under socially accepted
conventions. The reasons given by the court include: (1)
the area of the replacement facilities and the landfill area
will be significantly reduced from the area of the MCAS
Futenma facilities, and (2) aircraft flying over residential
areas can be avoided by the land-fill in the coastal area that
puts the runway extension out to the sea, and the replacement
facilities will be installed using part of Camp Schwab, which
is already provided to the U.S. Forces.
Moreover, regarding whether the construction of
replacement facilities takes environmental protection and
other considerations into adequate account, the Supreme
Court, finding that construction methods, environmental
protection measures and countermeasures that can conceivably
be taken at this point in time have been taken and that there is
sufficient consideration for disaster prevention, determined
that it cannot be said that then Governor Nakaima’s decision
was illegal. The court did not find that there was anything
particularly unreasonable in then Governor Nakaima’s
decision-making process and the content of the decision that
the construction met the condition of Article 4 (1) (ii) of the
Act on Reclamation of Publicly-owned Water Surface, “the
land-fill gives sufficient consideration to the protection of the
environment and prevention of disasters.”
c. Retraction of the Revocation of the Land-Fill Permit

Following this Supreme Court ruling, in December 2016,
then Governor Onaga retracted the revocation of the landfill permit and the Okinawa Defense Bureau resumed the


**（4）Completion of Environmental Impact Assessment**
Procedures

The MOD sent the environmental impact assessment scoping
document in 2007 to the Governor of Okinawa and other
parties. After the MOD worked on revising the document
based on the opinions provided by the governor, the MOD
completed the environmental impact assessment procedures
by sending the revised assessment document to related parties
including the governor in December 2012, while making the
assessment document available for public review. Throughout
these procedures, the MOD received a total of 1,561 opinions
from the Governor of Okinawa on six occasions, made all the
required revisions, and reflected them in the content of the
environmental assessment. In this way, the MOD had taken
steps to comply with relevant laws, asked opinions and ideas
from Okinawa Prefecture over a sufficient period of time, and
reflected them in the assessment.


**Chapter**


**（5）Promotion of the Futenma Replacement Facility**
Construction Project

a. Suits over the Revocation of the Land-Fill Permit
The Director General of the Okinawa Defense Bureau
submitted the land-fill permit request on public waters to
Okinawa Prefecture in March 2013, and then Governor
of Okinawa Nakaima approved this in December 2013.
However, then Governor of Okinawa Onaga revoked the
land-fill permit by then Governor of Okinawa Nakaima in
October 2015, leading to the filing of three suits over the
revocation of the land-fill permit between the Government of
Japan and Okinawa Prefecture.[7]

Under these circumstances, the court came up with a
settlement recommendation, and the Government of Japan
and Okinawa Prefecture reached a court-mediated settlement
agreement in March 2016. In the settlement, the Government
of Japan and Okinawa mutually affirmed that after the final
judicial ruling is handed down by the Supreme Court, they
would abide by the ruling and take steps in line with the spirit
of the text of the ruling and the reasons conducive to the text,
and continue to take responses in good faith by cooperating
with each other in accordance with the purpose of the ruling.
Pursuant to the provisions of the settlement agreement,
the Director General of the Okinawa Defense Bureau


(1) The suit, filed by the Government of Japan as plaintiff based on Article 245-8 of the Local Autonomy Act, seeking a court ruling instructing a retraction of the revocation of the land-fill
permit by Governor Onaga (the so-called subrogation suit); (2) the suit, filed by Okinawa Prefecture based on Article 251-5 of the Local Autonomy Act, seeking to invalidate the decision to
suspend the validity of the revocation of the land-fill permit (the decision to stay execution) by the Minister of Land, Infrastructure, Transport and Tourism as the illegal “involvement of the
state”; and (3) the suit, filed by Okinawa Prefecture based on Article 3 of the Administrative Case Litigation Act, seeking to invalidate the decision to stay execution by the Minister of Land,

replacement facilities construction project. In April 2017, it
started the construction of the seawall, the main part of the
public waters reclamation.
d. Lawsuit Related to Damage to the Reefs on the Seafloor, Etc.

In July 2017, Okinawa Prefecture filed suit in the Naha
District Court, requesting that this seawall construction not
be allowed to damage the reefs on the seafloor, etc., without
permission from the Governor of Okinawa based on the
regulations of Okinawa Prefecture. Subsequently, the district
court dismissed Okinawa Prefecture’s claim in March 2018,
and the Naha Branch of the Fukuoka High Court dismissed
Okinawa Prefecture’s appeal in December of the same year.
In the same month, Okinawa Prefecture filed a petition
of final appeal with the Supreme Court, but withdrew the
petition in March 2019.
e. Situation Surrounding the Land-Fill Work

In August 2018, Okinawa Prefecture revoked the landfill permit again on the basis of problems concerning
environmental protection measures and the soil foundation of
the land-fill area. In October of the same year, the Okinawa
Defense Bureau filed a request for review and a petition
for a stay of execution under the Administrative Complaint
Review Act against the revocation of the permit, and the stay
of execution was upheld. Following the ruling, the Okinawa
Defense Bureau resumed the land-fill operation in December
of the same year in the waters south of Camp Schwab.
In April 2019, the Minister of Land, Infrastructure,
Transport and Tourism determined that the revocation of the
land-fill permit by Okinawa Prefecture should be repealed.
Dissatisfied with this decision, the Governor of Okinawa filed
a request for a review with the Central and Local Government
Dispute Management Council in the same month. The Council
dismissed this request in June 2019. In July 2019, protesting
the dismissal of the Council, the Governor of Okinawa filed a
lawsuit with the Naha Branch of the Fukuoka High Court to
revoke the government’s involvement (determination by the
Minister of Land, Infrastructure, Transport and Tourism), and
in August 2019 filed a lawsuit with the Naha District Court
seeking the revocation of the determination by the Minister of
Land, Infrastructure, Transport and Tourism. In October 2019,
the Naha Branch of the Fukuoka High Court dismissed the
Governor of Okinawa’s suit. In the same month, the Governor
of Okinawa filed a petition for acceptance of final appeal with
the Supreme Court, which was dismissed in March 2020.
In implementing the relocation, the MOD has conducted
environmental impact assessment for about five years, and


given the utmost consideration for the natural environment.
Throughout the procedures, the MOD received more than
1,500 opinions from the Governor of Okinawa on six
occasions, all of which the MOD reflected in the content of
the environmental assessment.
If the waters are enclosed by the seawall, the coral
will be isolated from the surrounding sea with the flow of
seawater shut down, a situation which will affect the coral
habitat. Therefore, corals living in the land-fill area on the
southern side which were designated for conservation were
transplanted before the area was enclosed.
The standard for conservation of corals is stricter than the
standard that was applied to the land-fill related to the second
runway of Naha Airport.[8]

Regarding coenobita, which are nationally designated
protected species, and the shellfish and crustaceans designated
as endangered species, relocation from the seashore and
seafloors in the construction area on the southern side to
other areas is also being appropriately implemented based on
instructions and advice from experts.
Regarding the soil foundation of the land-fill area, as a result
of a study conducted on the stability of seawalls and other
structures in the waters north of Camp Schwab in light of the
results of a boring survey, it has been confirmed that although
the work to improve the soil foundation is necessary, it is
possible to implement the construction of seawalls and
land-fill while ensuring the required stability through
prevailing and adequately proven construction methods.[9]

Since September 2019, the Technical Review Committee
on Futenma Replacement Facility Construction Project,
consisting of experts in the fields of geotechnical, structural,

coastal, and pavement engineering, has been held to obtain
objective technical recommendations and advice in order to
make the design, construction, and maintenance of seawalls
and land-fill sites more rational for the future implementation
of the project. In December 2019, the Okinawa Defense
Bureau announced that, based on the results of the studies
that had been conducted, it would take nine years and three
months from the commencement to the completion of
construction based on the revised plan, and take about 12
years to complete the “admin procedures” described in the
Okinawa Consolidation Plan and a fund of about 930 billion
yen. Hearing experts’ insights on the environment and
others, after due consideration, in April 2020, the Okinawa
Defense Bureau submitted to Okinawa Prefecture a request
for revision of land-fill permit due to addition of the soil


**Chapter**


Specifically, in relation to the construction of the second runway of Naha Airport, around 37,000 clusters of small corals were transplanted. If the same standard as the one applicable to
the construction of the alternative facility was applied, the number of clusters of small corals transplanted would have been around 170,000.

The standard methods are the sand compaction pile method, the sand drain method, and the paper drain method. Among examples of projects in which these methods were used is the

improvement work, etc., based on the Act on Reclamation of
Publicly-owned Water Surface.
In February 2019, Okinawa Prefecture held a referendum
on whether or not to support the land-fill work related to
the relocation of MCAS Futenma to the Henokosaki area in
Nago City. As a result, 114,933 voters voted for the work,
434,273 voters voted against it, and 52,682 voters voted
neither (the total number of votes cast was 605,385 and the
voter turnout was 52.48%).
The present situation in which U.S. bases are concentrated
in Okinawa is in no way acceptable, and it is a grave
responsibility of the government to mitigate the impact on
Okinawa.
The government takes the results of the prefectural
referendum seriously and will continue to do its utmost
efforts to mitigate the impact of the U.S. bases in Okinawa.
It is imperative to prevent MCAS Futenma, which is
surrounded by houses and schools and which is said to be
the most dangerous base in the world, from continuing to
be used indefinitely and to pose a danger. The government
believes that this view is shared with the people of residents
in Okinawa.
The relocation to Henoko does not mean that all
functions of MCAS Futenma will be relocated there. Of
MCAS Futenma’s three functions, two will be moved out
of Okinawa while the remaining one will be relocated to
Henoko, resulting in the total return of the site of MCAS
Futenma.
Indeed, from the viewpoint of sharing the impact,
progress is being made in implementation of measures to
realize the total return of the site of MCAS Futenma based
on understanding and cooperation by local public entities
outside Okinawa. The measures include the relocation of air
refueling aircraft to Yamaguchi Prefecture and the relocation
of the function of accepting transient aircraft in contingencies
to Fukuoka and Miyazaki Prefectures.
Although more than 20 years have passed since Japan
and the United States agreed on the total return of the site
of MCAS Futenma, it has not been achieved yet. The MOD
believes that the return must not be postponed any longer.
The MOD intends to continue making efforts to secure the
understanding of local residents in Okinawa through years
of persistent dialogue, and do its utmost to achieve the total
return of MCAS Futenma as early as possible.

**5** Force Reduction and Relocation to Guam


**（1）Timing and Size of Relocation**

The 2006 Roadmap stated that approximately 8,000
personnel of the III MEF and their approximately 9,000
dependents would relocate from Okinawa to Guam by 2014,
but the “2+2” Meeting in June 2011 and other agreements
set the timing of the relocation for the earliest possible date
after 2014.
Subsequently, at the “2+2” Meeting held in April 2012,
the Governments of Japan and the United States decided
to delink both the relocation of III MEF personnel from
Okinawa to Guam and the resulting land return south of
Kadena Air Base from the progress on the FRF and to adjust
the composition of the units and the number of personnel
to be relocated to Guam. As a result, MAGTF is to locate
in Japan, Guam, and Hawaii, approximately 9,000 personnel
are to be relocated to locations outside of Japan (about
4,000 of whom are to be relocated to Guam), the authorized
strength of the U.S. Marine Corps forces in Guam is to be
approximately 5,000 personnel, and an end-state for the U.S.
Marine Corps presence in Okinawa is to be consistent with
the level of approximately 10,000 personnel envisioned in
the Roadmap.
Accordingly, the “2+2” Meeting held in October 2013
agreed that, under the relocation plan described at the
2012 “2+2” Meeting, the relocation of U.S. Marine Corps
units from Okinawa to Guam is to begin in the first half
of the 2020s. The plan is expected to facilitate progress in
implementing the consolidation plan for facilities and areas
in Okinawa of April 2013.


**Chapter**


**（2）Costs of the Relocation**

Under the Roadmap, the two sides reached an agreement that,
of the estimated US$10.27 billion (in U.S. fiscal year 2008
dollars) cost of the facilities and infrastructure development
costs, Japan would provide US$6.09 billion, including
US$2.8 billion in direct cash contribution, while the United
States would fund the remaining US$4.18 billion. In February
2009, the Japanese Government and the U.S. Government
signed “the Agreement Between the Government of Japan
and the Government of the United States of America
Concerning the Implementation of the Relocation of the
III MEF Personnel and Their Dependents from Okinawa to
Guam” (the Guam International Agreement). The Agreement
legally guarantees and ensures actions taken by Japan and
the United States, such as Japan’s long-term funding for
projects to which Japan provides direct cash contributions.
As part of measures based on this Agreement, the Japanese
Government has been providing cash contributions to the
U.S. Government in relation to the projects for which Japan


Since the Roadmap was announced in May 2006, the
Governments of Japan and the United States held a series of
consultations on the reduction of the U.S. Forces in Okinawa.


-----

has provided financial support since FY2009.[10]

Subsequently, at the “2+2” Meeting held in April 2012,
the unit composition and the number of personnel to be
relocated to Guam were adjusted and it was agreed that
the preliminary cost estimate by the U.S. Government for
the relocation was US$8.6 billion (in U.S. fiscal year 2012
dollars). With regard to Japan’s financial commitment, it
was reaffirmed that it was to be the direct cash contribution
of up to US$2.8 billion (in U.S. fiscal year 2008 dollars) as
stipulated in Article 1 of the Guam International Agreement.
It was also confirmed that Japan’s equity investment and
loans for family housing projects and infrastructure projects
would not be utilized.[11] Moreover, it was stipulated that any
funds that had already been provided to the U.S. Government
under the Guam International Agreement would be counted
as part of the Japanese contribution. Furthermore, as a new
initiative, a portion of the direct cash contribution of US$2.8
billion mentioned above would be used to develop training
areas in Guam and the Commonwealth of the Northern
Mariana Islands as shared-use facilities by Japan and the
United States. In addition, it was agreed that the remaining
costs and any additional costs would be borne by the United
States, and that the two governments were to complete a
bilateral cost breakdown.
At the “2+2” Meeting in October 2013, a Protocol
Amending the Guam International Agreement was also
signed to add the stipulations concerning the development
of training areas in Guam and the Commonwealth of the
Northern Mariana Islands, and the use of these training
areas by the SDF. The limit on Japanese cash contributions
remains unchanged at US$2.8 billion (in U.S. fiscal year
2008 dollars). Both countries also completed work reflecting
the breakdown of the associated costs.
Furthermore, the National Defense Authorization Act for
U.S. Fiscal Year 2015 was enacted in December 2014, which
lifted the freeze on the use of funds for the relocation to Guam
imposed by the U.S. Congress in U.S. Fiscal Year 2012.


Furthermore, the Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana
Islands Joint Military Training Environmental Impact
Statement (CJMT-EIS), is now being implemented.


**（4）Progress of the Guam Relocation Project**

While the environmental impact assessment for Guam was
being conducted, the Government of the United States
implemented infrastructure development projects at the
Andersen Air Force Base and the Apra area of the Naval
Base Guam as projects unaffected by the assessment. The
U.S. Government is currently implementing relocation
construction work in all project areas, following the lifting
of the freeze on the Guam relocation funds pursuant to the
National Defense Authorization Act and the completion of
the environmental impact assessment for Guam.

**6** Return of Land Areas South of Kadena Air base

The Roadmap stated that following the relocation to the
FRF, the return of MCAS Futenma, and the transfer of III
MEF personnel to Guam, the remaining facilities and areas
on Okinawa will be consolidated, thereby enabling the
return of significant land areas south of Kadena Air Base.
Subsequently, at the “2+2” Meeting in April 2012, it was
decided to delink the progress on the FRF from both the
relocation of the III MEF personnel from Okinawa to Guam
and the resulting land returns south of Kadena. In addition,
with regard to the land to be returned, it was agreed to

conduct consultations focusing on three categories, namely

**（1）Consolidation Plan for Facilities and Areas in Okinawa**

Since the change of administration at the end of 2012, Japan
and the United States have continued consultation under
the basic policy of the Abe administration to dedicate all
its strength to mitigate the impact of the U.S. Forces on
Okinawa communities. Japan strongly requested an early
return of land areas south of Kadena, including Makiminato
Service Area (Camp Kinser) in Urasoe City of which


**（3）Completion of Environmental Impact Assessment**
Procedures

As for the environmental impact assessment for Guam, the
required procedures were conducted to reflect the revisions to
the project made by the adjustments to the plan for realignment,
and the assessment was completed in August 2015.


10 As for projects for which Japan provides financial support, cash contributions of approximately 229.8 billion yen have been provided to the U.S. side using the budgets from FY2009 to
FY2019.

11 In line with this, the special provisions for the operations of the Japan Bank for International Cooperation (investment and loan) that had been prescribed by the Act on Special Measures on

Okinawa has particularly made a strong request for the return
and coordination with the United States. As a result, both
countries announced the Consolidation Plan for Facilities
and Areas in Okinawa (Consolidation Plan) in April 2013,

which stipulated the return schedule, including the specifi c
years of return.
The return of all land according to the plan will enable
the return of approximately 70% (approximately 1,048 ha,
the equivalent of 220 Tokyo Domes) of six USFJ facilities
for exclusive use[12] located in densely populated areas in the
central and southern parts of the main island of Okinawa.
In the Consolidation Plan, both sides confi rmed that


they would implement the plan as early as possible. The
Government of Japan will continue to work with all its
strength so that land areas south of Kadena would be returned
at the earliest possible date.
Furthermore, following the announcement of the
Consolidation Plan, consultations[13] have been held since
April 2013, involving Ginowan City, Ginowan City Military
Land Owners Association, Okinawa Prefecture, Okinawa
Defense Bureau, and Okinawa General Bureau in a bid to
contribute to the promotion of the effective and appropriate
use of West Futenma Housing Area within Camp Zukeran,
and the MOD has also been providing necessary cooperation.

Marine Corps, plays an important role in engaging in a broad
range of activities, including transportation of personnel and
supplies.
The U.S. Marine Corps replaced aged rotary-wing
aircraft (CH-46) with MV-22s, which have superior basic
performance. In September 2013, all the 24 CH-46s deployed
at MCAS Futenma were replaced by MV-22s.
The MV-22 is a highly capable aircraft compared with
the CH-46; on its flight speed, payload and flight range.
Its deployment to Okinawa strengthens the deterrence of
the overall USFJ and greatly contributes to the peace and
stability of the region.


**（2）Progress in the Return of Land**

Efforts have been made to enable the early return of land
areas, including the land areas that are to be returned as soon
as required procedures are completed (shown in red in Fig.
III-2-4-11), since the announcement of the Consolidation
Plan in April 2013. These efforts resulted in the realization
of the return of the north access road of Makiminato Service
Area (approximately 1 ha) in August 2013, West Futenma
Housing Area of Camp Zukeran (approximately 51 ha) at
the end of March 2015 (transferred to the landowners at the
end of March 2018), the area near Gate 5 of Makiminato
Service Area (approximately 2 ha) at the end of March 2019,
and portions of land at Camp Zukeran (Warehouse Area of
Facilities and Engineering Compound) (approximately 11
ha) at the end of March 2020.
Additionally, in December 2015, Japan and the United
States agreed to such measures as the early return of partial
land at MCAS Futenma (approximately 4 ha) for a municipal
road, and the early return of partial land at Makiminato
Service Area (approximately 3 ha) for the purpose of
widening National Route to reduce traffic congestion, for
which there had been particularly strong demand for return
among local people, and the former return was realized at
the end of July 2017, whereas the latter return was realized
at the end of March 2018. Furthermore, such measures as
relocation to Kadena Ammunition Storage Area (Chibana
Area), Torii Communication Station, Camp Hansen and
Camp Zukeran have been implemented to advance the land
return.
All-out initiatives are being continuously made to steadily
implement the return of land areas south of Kadena Air Base
under the Consolidation Plan and to realize the respective
returns of land in the shortest possible time for more visible
mitigation of the impact on Okinawa.

**（2）Deployment of CV-22 Osprey by the U.S. Air Force to**
Yokota Air Base

In May 2015, the United States announced that CV-22,
specified for U.S. Air Force, would be deployed to Yokota
Air Base (which encompasses Fussa City, Tachikawa City,
Akishima City, Musashi Murayama City, Hamura City and
Mizuho Town of Tokyo Prefecture). A total of 10 CV-22
Ospreys are scheduled to be deployed in stages by around
2024, with the first five CV-22s deployed to Yokota Air Base
in October 2018.
The CV-22 deployed to Yokota Air Base plays a role in
transporting personnel and supplies of the special operation
units of the U.S. Forces to address crises and emergencies
in the Asia-Pacific region, including humanitarian assistance
and natural disasters.

Consolidation Plan, but it was revised to 11 ha based on the area to be returned in the JC agreement of September 2013.

6. JC: Japan-U.S. Joint Committee


As Japan faces the increasingly severe security
environment, the deployment of high-performance CV-22
enhances the deterrence and response capabilities of the
Japan-U.S. Alliance and contributes to the defense of Japan
and the stability of the region from the perspective of the
commitment by the U.S. to the Asia-Pacific region and the
building-up of readiness by the United States.


Additionally, the CV-22 has the same propulsion system
as the MV-22 and the structure of both aircraft is basically in
common; therefore, the safety of both aircraft is at the same
level.
Japan considers that ensuring safety is of prime importance
in operations of the U.S. Forces, and on various occasions,
Minister of Defense requested Secretary of Defense and
other high-ranking officials to give consideration to local
communities and ensure safety. The Government of Japan
will continue to ask for the maximum consideration for
safety.

See Reference 28 (Chronology of Osprey Deployment by the U.S.

Forces)


**（3）Safety of Osprey**

Prior to the deployment of MV-22s to MCAS Futenma in
2012, Japan established an analysis and assessment team
composed of aircraft pilots and experts from inside and
outside the Government and confirmed the safety of MV22 by conducting its own survey, etc. In addition, when
Japan made the decision to introduce Ospreys in 2014, the
Government reconfirmed their safety by collecting and
analyzing all kinds of technical information, not only in the
preparation phase, but also after the decision of introduction.
The MOD has dispatched the GSDF Osprey personnel to the
U.S. Marine Corps’ training programs since the fall of 2016.
The personnel who piloted and maintained the aircraft are of
the opinion that the Osprey is a reliable aircraft that allows
for stable maneuvering and maintenance.


**（4）Usability of Osprey Deployed by the U.S. Forces in**
Case of Disaster

In the aftermath of the devastating typhoon that hit the central
part of the Philippines in November 2013, 14 MV-22 aircraft,
deployed in Okinawa, were dispatched for humanitarian

assistance and disaster relief activities to support Operation
Damayan. The MV-22s were deployed promptly to affected
areas that were difficult to access, and transported several
hundred isolated victims and about six tons of relief materials
in a day.

Osprey deployed by the U.S. Forces can be showcased in a
variety of operations in the future as well.

**8 Consultation Structures for Mitigating the Impact**
of Bases on Okinawa


In order to mitigate the concentrated impact on Okinawa,
the Government of Japan has been committed to further
mitigating the impact, listening to, for example, the opinions
of the local residents through various consultative bodies.

**9 Initiatives for the Use of Lands Previously**
Provided for Use by the Stationed Forces


US Marine Corps MV-22 Ospray flew to the Kokubudai maneuver Area, Kagawa Prefecture, for
exercise (December 2019)

In April 2014, the MV-22, deployed in Okinawa, was
dispatched for search and rescue activities in the wake of an
accidental sinking of a passenger ship off the coast of Jindo
in the ROK.
Furthermore, in response to the large earthquake that hit
Nepal in April 2015, four MV-22s deployed in Okinawa were
dispatched to the country to transport personnel and supplies.
In Japan, when the Kumamoto Earthquake occurred in
2016, MV-22s were dispatched to deliver daily necessities to
the disaster stricken areas.
In this manner, the MV-22 is capable of conducting
humanitarian assistance and disaster relief activities
immediately and over a large range when large-scale
disasters occur because of its high performance and multifunctionality. It has also been used for disaster prevention
drills since 2014. In September 2016, two MV-22s
participated in the comprehensive disaster prevention drills
of Sasebo City, Nagasaki Prefecture and conducted delivery
drills for isolated islands.
Like the MV-22, the CV-22 can conduct humanitarian
assistance and disaster relief activities, including search and
rescue missions, both immediately and over a large range, in
the case of a large-scale disaster.
As such, it is expected that the superior capabilities of the

The Act on Special Measures Concerning Promotion of
Effective and Appropriate Use of the Lands in Okinawa
Prefecture Previously Provided for Use by the Stationed
Forces stipulates various measures concerning lands in
Okinawa provided for use by the USFJ (“USFJ Land”)
agreed to be returned. The MOD mainly conducts the
following initiatives, and will continue its initiatives to
promote the effective and appropriate use of returned lands
by coordinating and cooperating with related ministries, the
prefectural government and local municipalities. The MOD:
(1) conducts mediation in relation to access for surveys, etc.,
to be implemented by the prefectural government and
local municipalities on the USFJ Land which are agreed
to be returned;
(2) conducts measures applying to all the returned lands
to remove obstacles for use such as soil contamination
and unexploded ordnance, not only those caused by the
activities of the stationed forces, before handing over the
land to the owners and
(3) provides financial benefits to alleviate the impact on the
owners of the returned lands and to promote use of the
land.


**❹ [Stationing of the U.S. Forces in Regions Other than Okinawa]**


In regions other than Okinawa, the MOD is implementing
measures to secure the stable stationing of the U.S. Forces by
maintaining its deterrence and trying to mitigate the impact
on local communities.

on the Japan-U.S. Joint Committee agreement of October
2004.
However, more than 10 years have passed since the initial
agreement, and Japan’s security environment has become
increasingly severe. Therefore, there have been changes in
the U.S. Navy’s posture and capabilities, as represented by
the increased operation of U.S. vessels at Commander Fleet
Activities, Yokosuka. In light of such circumstances, the
following were agreed at the Japan-U.S. Joint Committee
meeting in November 2018: (1) development of facilities for
satisfying the U.S. Navy’s facility requirements; (2) start of


negotiation on joint use of the Negishi Dependent Housing
Area to conduct site restoration works; and (3) cancellation
of the plan to construct family housing in the Yokohama
City area of the Ikego Housing Area and Navy Annex.
Subsequently, joint use of the Negishi Dependent Housing
Area was agreed upon at the Japan-U.S. Joint Committee
meeting in November 2019.

a. Commencement of the Operation of the Bilateral Joint
Operations Coordination Center (BJOCC) and the Relocation
of ASDF Air Defense Command Headquarters (HQ)

Enhancement of coordination between the headquarters
of both countries, combined with the transition to joint
operational posture, is highly important to ensure a response
with flexibility and readiness of the SDF and the U.S. Forces.


Therefore, at the end of FY2011, the BJOCC commenced
its operations at Yokota Air Base and the ASDF Air Defense
Command HQ[14] and its relevant units were relocated to
Yokota Air Base. These arrangements have made it possible
to enhance coordination between the headquarters of the SDF
and the U.S. Forces, including the sharing of information
concerning air defense and BMD.
b. Yokota Airspace

To facilitate the operations of civilian aircraft in Yokota
airspace, where the U.S. Forces conduct radar approach
control, measures have been taken since 2006 to temporarily
transfer the responsibility for air traffic control of portions
of Yokota airspace to Japanese authorities, to deploy ASDF

**(4) Measures Relating to Naval Air Facility Atsugi and**
MCAS Iwakuni

a. Relocation of Carrier-Based Aircraft

Since Naval Air Facility Atsugi (Ayase City and Yamato City
in Kanagawa Prefecture) is located in an urban district, the
noise of carrier jets taking off and landing in particular had
been a problem for a long time.
Thus, after the completion of the runway relocation
project[16] at MCAS Iwakuni (Iwakuni City, Yamaguchi
Prefecture), which made aircraft operations possible with
less impact on the living environment of the surrounding
communities, it was decided that CVW-5 squadrons would be
relocated from Naval Air Facility Atsugi to MCAS Iwakuni.
The relocation began in August 2017 and completed in
March 2018. As a result, the noise in areas around Naval Air
Facility Atsugi was alleviated to a significant extent, while
maintaining the forward deployment of a U.S. aircraft carrier
and carrier-based aircraft.
In order to mitigate impacts of the increased operations at
MCAS Iwakuni due to the relocation, the related measures
listed in Fig. III-2-4-17 have been implemented. If all of
these measures are fully implemented, the noise problems
are expected to be mitigated from the current situation, with
the area requiring residential noise-abatement work, or the
so-called first category area, decreasing from approximately
1,600 ha to approximately 650 ha.

See Fig. III-2-4-17 (Measures Related to Naval Air Facility Atsugi

and MCAS Iwakuni and Their Status of Progress, etc.)

b. Field-Carrier Landing Practice (FCLP)

The 2006 Roadmap prescribes that a bilateral framework
to conduct a study on a permanent FCLP facility is to be
established with the goal of selecting a permanent site at the
earliest possible date. In December 2019, the MOD acquired
more than half of the land on Mage Island in Nisinoomote City,


officers at the Yokota Radar Approach Control (Yokota
RAPCON), and to reduce the airspace by about 40% (i.e.,
the release of air traffic control from USFJ).
c. Civilian-Military Dual Use of Yokota Air Base

At the Japan-U.S. Summit Meeting held in May 2003, it
was agreed that the joint civilian-military use of Yokota
Air Base would be studied, and a Liaison Conference was
then established as a working panel attended by relevant
government ministries and agencies and the Tokyo
Metropolitan Government. The Governments of Japan and
the United States are also conducting a study on the specific
conditions and modalities, with the understanding that both
countries will not compromise the military operations and
safety of Yokota Air Base.

(3) Deployment of U.S. Aircraft Carrier to Commander
Fleet Activities, Yokosuka

The presence of the U.S. Pacific Fleet plays an important role

in ensuring maritime security in the Indo-Pacific region as
well as regional peace and stability. The U.S. aircraft carrier
provides the core capability of the Fleet.
The U.S. Navy affirms that it will continue to ensure
that all of its forward-deployed nuclear-powered vessels,
including USS “Ronald Reagan,”[15] which anchored at
Commander Fleet Activities, Yokosuka (Yokosuka City,
Kanagawa Prefecture), adhere to the relevant safety policies.
For example, the nuclear reactor will normally be shut down
while the aircraft carrier is anchored, and repairing and
refueling will not be carried out in Japan. The Government
of Japan will continue taking all possible measures to ensure
safety.


15 Nuclear-powered aircraft carriers do not need to replenish their fuel and they are able to maintain the high speeds necessary for the operation of aircraft, giving them excellent combat and
operational capabilities.

Kagoshima Prefecture, and is conducting various surveys in
preparation for the development of SDF facilities. This SDF
facility would be used to support operations in response to a
variety of situations, including large-scale disasters, as well
as regular exercises and other activities, including use by the
U.S. Forces as a permanent site for FCLP.
In addition, the 2005 SCC document confirmed that the
U.S. Forces will continue to conduct FCLP at Iwo-To in
accordance with existing temporary arrangements until a
permanent training facility is identified.
c. Resumption of Civil Aviation Operations at MCAS Iwakuni

Considering that the local public entities, etc., including
Yamaguchi Prefecture and Iwakuni City, had been working
together to request the resumption of civil aviation
operations, it was agreed in the Roadmap that “portions of the
future civilian air facility will be accommodated at MCAS
Iwakuni.” Based on this agreement, Iwakuni Kintaikyo
Airport was opened in December 2012, resuming regular
flights of civil aviation aircraft for the first time in 48 years.

**(6) Training Relocation**


a. Aviation Training Relocation (ATR)

Based on the decision that U.S. aircraft from three USFJ
facilities and areas—Kadena, Misawa (Misawa City and
Tohoku Town in Aomori Prefecture) and MCAS Iwakuni—
would participate for the time being in bilateral training with
the SDF at SDF facilities, the Aviation Training Relocation
(ATR)[18] has been underway since 2007. The MOD has been
improving its infrastructure, as required, for the training
relocation.

See Fig. III-2-4-18 (Overview of the Background to the Aviation

Training Relocation)

The ATR contributes to enhancing interoperability between
the two countries, and also to relocating part of air-to-ground
training conducted by using Kadena Air Base. Thus, this
training relocation will help noise abatement around Kadena
Air Base, thereby contributing to the mitigation of the impact
on Okinawa.
In addition to assisting the USFJ, the MOD/SDF is
making efforts to ensure the safety and security of the local
community, such as the establishment of a liaison office,
facilitating communication with related government agencies,
and response to requirements from the local community.
These efforts have been contributing to successful training


In June 2006, an AN/TPY-2 radar (so-called “X-Band
Radar”) system was deployed to the U.S. Shariki Radar Site
(Tsugaru City, Aomori Prefecture).[17] Also in October 2006,
U.S. Army Patriot PAC-3 units (Patriot Advanced Capability)
were deployed to Kadena Air Base (Kadena Town, Okinawa
City and Chatan Town in Okinawa Prefecture) and Kadena
Ammunition Storage Area (Yomitan Village, Okinawa City,
Kadena Town, Onna Village and Uruma City in Okinawa
Prefecture). In December 2014, the second TPY-2 radar in
Japan was deployed to the U.S. Kyogamisaki Communication


17 The radar was deployed to ASDF Shariki Sub Base (in Aomori Prefecture) in June 2006, but was thereafter transferred to the neighboring U.S. Shariki Communication Site.

relocation.
b. Relocation of Training for MV-22

The Government of Japan and the United States Government
decided in the “2+2” joint statement of October 2013, to
utilize the opportunities to participate in various operations
in mainland Japan and across the region to reduce the
amount of time that MV-22s are deployed and used for the
training in Okinawa so that training outside of Okinawa
Prefecture, including mainland Japan, can be increased while
maintaining the deterrence of the Alliance. Based on above,
both the governments have been moving forward with the
training of the MV-22 deployed at MCAS Futenma outside
of Okinawa Prefecture, etc.
In September 2016, it was agreed at the Joint Committee
to relocate the training activities of Tilt-Rotor/Rotary Wing
aircraft, such as AH-1, CH53, and the MV-22 that are currently
deployed at MCAS Futenma out of Okinawa Prefecture at
Japan’s expense in order to further promote training outside
of Okinawa to mitigate the impact of training activities there.
Three bilateral training (field training by the GSDF and
U.S. Marines) were conducted in FY2019 (in Shiga and
Kagawa prefectures in December 2019, and in Hokkaido,
Kumamoto, Miyazaki, and Kagoshima prefectures in
January 2020). From the date of the agreement up to March
2020, a total of ten training, including the ones mentioned

above, have been conducted in Guam and in Japan at the
exercise sites in Miyagi, Gunma, Niigata, Fukuoka and Oita
prefectures.
The MV-22’s amount of time deployed and training in
Okinawa will continue to be reduced by relocating exercises
held in mainland of Japan and Guam, and the Government
will continue to promote initiatives that contribute to further
mitigating the impact on Okinawa.


**❺ [Initiatives for Smooth Implementation of the Realignment of the USFJ]**


In order to smoothly implement the realignment of the USFJ
based on the Roadmap, the Act on Special Measures on
Smooth Implementation of the Realignment of United States
Forces in Japan (USFJ Realignment Special Measures Act)
was enacted in August 2007. Realignment grants, Special
Subsidy Rates for Public Projects, etc. and other systems
were established based on the law.
In addition, under the U.S. Forces realignment, some USFJ
facilities and areas will be returned, and the U.S. Marine
Corps in Okinawa will be relocated to Guam. Since these
developments may affect the employment of USFJ local
employees, the Government of Japan will take measures to
include education and skills training, which is to help retain
their employment.


The Realignment Special Measures Act was supposed
to cease to be effective as of March 31, 2017. However,
since there remain realignment projects that require
implementation, on March 31, 2017, an act revising part of
the Act including a ten-year extension of the time limit of the
Act to March 31, 2027 was enacted.

**Security Cooperation**
###### 3


In situations where the need and potential for international
cooperation in the security and defense areas are increasing
unprecedentedly, the Ministry of Defense (MOD)/SelfDefense Forces (SDF) is required to actively contribute to
ensuring the security of Japan, the peace and stability of
the region, and the peace, stability, and prosperity of the
entire international community from the perspective of
“Proactive Contribution to Peace” based on the principle of
international cooperation. In line with the free and open IndoPacifi c vision,[1] and in accordance with the National Defense
Program Guidelines for FY2019 and beyond (NDPG),
Japan will strengthen bilateral and multilateral defense
cooperation and exchanges as part of multi-faceted and
multi-layered security cooperation, while paying attention


to its partner nations’ regional characteristics and situations.
Japan will also actively advance its efforts to solve global
security issues, including securing the freedom and safety of
navigation and overfl ight, coordination and cooperation with
relevant countries in relation to the use of the space and cyber
domains, international peace cooperation activities, arms
control and disarmament, and non-proliferation of weapons
of mass destruction. These efforts will be promoted mainly
under the framework of the Japan-U.S. Alliance and in close
coordination with countries that share the same universal
values and security interests as Japan. The MOD/SDF further
intends to create a desirable security environment for Japan
by engaging in the routine activities.

and defense equipment and technology cooperation aimed at
ensuring Japan’s security and promoting international peace
and cooperation.
The MOD/SDF has long strived to alleviate any conditions
of confrontation and tension, and to foster a collaborative
and cooperative atmosphere by building face-to-face
relationships through bilateral dialogues and exchanges.
In addition, the MOD/SDF has recently enhanced bilateral
defense relationships from traditional exchanges to deeper
cooperation in a phased manner by appropriately combining
various means, including bilateral/multilateral training
and exercises, capacity building, defense equipment and
technology cooperation, and the development of institutional
frameworks such as the Acquisition and Cross-Servicing
Agreements (ACSA).
In addition, multilateral regional security cooperation and
dialogue are in the process of evolving from those that focus
on dialogue to those that focus on cooperation that seeks to
build regional order. It is important to promote bilateral and
multilateral defense cooperation and exchanges in a multilayered, practical manner in order to create an ideal security
environment.
In response to the cancellation of meetings with foreign
countries, such as the Japan Pacifi c Islands Defense
Dialogue (JPIDD, in connection with measures against
novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19), the MOD has
held more telephone conversations than usual, deepening
communication with foreign countries and promoting
defense cooperation and exchanges from the government
offi ce in Ichigaya, Tokyo.

On the other hand, a range of challenges exist for the
promotion of FOIP in the region, including Japan’s vicinity,
such as a rapid modernization of military forces and an
increase in military activities.

**(2) Direction of the MOD’s Initiatives**

In light of this situation, the MOD/SDF are promoting defense
cooperation and exchanges to ensure that Japan can secure
the stable use of major sea lanes. In addition, the MOD/SDF
are promoting mutual understanding and confi dence building
with countries that have modernized their military forces and
intensifi ed their military activities to prevent contingencies
and ensure Japan’s security. Furthermore, for countries in
the region that are taking steps to respond to changes in the
environment, the MOD/SDF aim to contribute to regional
peace and stability by supporting their efforts through defense
cooperation and exchanges.


**Chapter**


**(3) Areas with Which Japan Will Enhance Cooperation for the**
**Realization of FOIP**

With respect to Southeast Asia, South Asia, Pacifi c Island
countries, the Middle East and Djibouti, the MOD/SDF
will enhance cooperation toward the realization of FOIP,
utilizing a wide range of means for defense cooperation and
exchanges, including cooperation and exchange of personnel,
cooperation and exchange of troops, capacity building, and
defense equipment and technology cooperation. Specifi cally,
the MOD/SDF are promoting defense cooperation and
exchanges to help countries in these regions to play more
effective roles in achieving stability in the Indo-Pacifi c region,
and to secure the stable use of sea lanes by establishing good
relations with these countries and ensuring that the SDF has
stable access to their ports and airports.

**(4) Countries That Japan Works With to Realize FOIP**

The United States as Japan’s ally, Australia, India, the United
Kingdom, France and other European countries, Canada and
New Zealand are countries that not only share fundamental
values with us, but also have geographic and historical
ties to the Indo-Pacifi c region. The MOD/SDF have been
encouraging these countries to become more involved in the
Indo-Pacifi c region. At the same time, the MOD/SDF have
also been promoting defense cooperation and exchanges
with them so that we can work together as partners when
promoting efforts for realizing FOIP in the areas listed in
(3) above. This way, we aim to achieve stronger effects than
when promoting efforts on our own.


**2 Efforts under the Vision of a Free and Open Indo-**
Pacifi c (FOIP)

**(1) Characteristics of the Indo-Pacifi c Region**

Free and open maritime order, which relies on the rule of
law, is the foundation for the stability and prosperity of the
international community. The Indo-Pacifi c region is at the
center of the world vitality, and home to more than half the
world’s population. It is important to establish this region
as a free and open global commons to secure peace and
prosperity in the region as a whole.

**Fig. III-3-1-1** Defense Cooperation and Exchanges


Defense cooperation and exchanges

“Defense cooperation and exchanges” refers to efforts to strengthen bilateral and multilateral defense relations by using various tools, which are significant
initiatives for securing the peace and stability of Japan and the international community.

Purpose of defense cooperation and exchanges

〇 To create a security environment desirable for Japan
〇 To deter threats from reaching Japan by making opponents realize that doing harm to Japan would be difficult and consequential
〇 To prevent contingencies through promoting confidence-building and mutual understanding

Tools for defense cooperation and exchanges

Tool 1: Cooperation and exchanges among people
On such occasions as the “2+2” Meeting, defense ministerial meetings, chief of staff-level meetings or other high-level meetings, working-level
consultations among defense authorities, and multilateral international conferences, participants frankly exchange views on defense policies, regional
situations, defense cooperation and exchanges, etc., thereby developing mutual understanding and building confidence among them and further promoting
defense cooperation and exchanges thereafter. Exchanges of students and interchange in education and research aim to facilitate understanding of defense
policies and statuses of military units of other countries and promote relations of trust through network building.

Free and Open Indo-Pacific Vision: FOIP

In August 2016, Prime Minister Abe unveiled the “Free and Open Indo-Pacific” concept in his keynote address at TICAD VI in Kenya.
Japan’s fundamental aim is to foster regional stability and prosperity by improving connectivity between Asia and Africa through a free and open Indo-Pacific region.


Three pillars of the vision
(i) Promotion and establishment of the rule of law, freedom of navigation and free trade.
(ii) Pursuit of economic prosperity (e.g. improving connectivity)
(iii) Commitment to peace and stability

MOD’s Approach to FOIP


(Cited from the website of
the Ministry of Foreign Affairs)


MOD’s Approach to FOIP Vision
1. Securing the stable use of major sea lanes by way of defense cooperation and exchange activities
2. Preventing contingencies through confidence building and mutual understanding
3. Contributing to peace and stability through active engagement in the region, in cooperation with partner countries

The National Defense Program Guidelines for FY2019 and beyond clearly states that in line with the vision of free and open Indo-Pacific, Japan will strategically
promote multi-faceted and multi-layered security cooperation, taking into account characteristics and situation specific to each region and country.

Japan and Australia are both allied with the United States
and share universal values. They cooperate closely to
resolve the various challenges the Indo-Pacific region
and the international community face. In order to ensure
the effectiveness and efficiency of such cooperation, it is
important for Japan and Australia to proactively promote
trilateral cooperation with the United States, whose presence
is indispensable for regional peace and stability.
The Security and Defense Cooperation Forum (SDCF),

**(1) Significance of Defense Cooperation and Exchanges with**
**India**

India is increasing its influence against a backdrop of its
population—the world’s second largest—, its high economic
growth, and its latent economic power. Located in the center
of sea lanes that connect Japan with the Middle East and
Africa, India is an extremely important country for Japan.
Furthermore, Japan and India share universal values as well
as common interests in the peace, stability, and prosperity
of Asia and the world, and have established the “Special
Strategic and Global Partnership.” In this context, Japan
and India have promoted cooperation in maritime security
and various other areas, while utilizing some frameworks
including the “2+2” meeting.
Defense cooperation and exchanges between Japan and
India have steadily deepened since October 2008, when
the two countries signed the Joint Declaration on Security
Cooperation between Japan and India. Meetings and
consultations at various levels such as the ministerial level,
as well as service-to-service exchanges including bilateral
and multilateral exercises, have been regularly conducted.

elevate the relationship between the two countries to an
“Extensive Strategic Partnership.” At the Japan-Vietnam
Summit Meeting in May 2018, both countries confirmed
that they would strengthen cooperation in the security and
defense areas.
At the Japan-Vietnam Defense Ministerial Meeting in April
2018, the “Joint Vision Statement on Japan-Vietnam Defense
Cooperation (Japan-Vietnam Joint Vision Statement)” was
signed to further promote Japan-Vietnam defense cooperation
and exchanges into the future. In the meeting, concerning the

actions to change the status quo made in the South China
Sea, and agreed on the importance of the peaceful conflict
resolutions based on international law and the conclusion of
an effective Code Of Conduct in the South China Sea at an
early time.
In May 2019, then Defense Minister Iwaya visited
Vietnam as Japanese defense minister for the first time in
about three and a half years. In addition to a Japan-Vietnam
Defense Ministerial meeting with Defense Minister Lịch, he
paid a courtesy call to Prime Minister Phuc and exchanged
opinions with the Commander of the Navy Nam. At the
Defense Ministerial meeting, the Ministers shared the policy

was announced in 2018. Regarding the regional situation,
they agreed to cooperate toward denuclearization of North
Korea, shared concerns about the unilateral moves in the
South China Sea to change the status quo and establish the
change as a fait accompli, and agreed that Japan and Vietnam
should closely work together on these issues. In addition, the
Memorandum on the Orientation of Promotion of Defense


Industry Cooperation was signed by the defense authorities
of Japan and Vietnam at the vice-ministerial level. The two
countries agreed to promote bilateral cooperation on defense
equipment and technology based on this memorandum.
Furthermore, at the Japan-Vietnam Leaders’ Working
Lunch held in July 2019, the leaders agreed on commencing
negotiations for an agreement concerning the transfer of
defense equipment and technology. In November 2019, the
Vice-Minister of Defense for International Affairs visited
Vietnam to pay a courtesy visit to Defense Minister Lịch

call on Defense Minister Lịch. He also held talks with Chief
of the General Staff Giang, agreeing to promote defense
cooperation and exchanges based on the Japan-Vietnam
Joint Vision and sharing their understanding of the security
environment surrounding the region. In July 2019, Major
General Dũng, Director of the Military Science Academy
of Vietnam, and four others visited the GSDF Military
Intelligence School. In October 2019, the GSDF and ASDF
officials who participated in the Japan-India bilateral exercise
Dharma Guardian 19 visited the Vietnamese units in Da Nang
to deepen exchanges. In December, the Chief of Staff, MSDF
made a visit to Vietnam and held talks with the Commander
of the Vietnam People’s Navy Nam, where they agreed to
strengthen relations between the two countries’ navies.
As for capacity building the ASDF held a follow-up
seminar in Hanoi in August 2019 for 18 cybersecurity
personnel of the People’s Army of Vietnam in order to check
the retention of the cybersecurity training that had been
conducted twice in the past. In December 2019, a workshop
on the disposal of unexploded ordnance in water was held for
about 30 officials from the Vietnam People’s Navy on board
the minesweeping tender JS “Bungo,” which was in port in
Da Nang. The participants were briefed by the ship’s crew on
the system for the disposal of unexploded ordnance in water,
which was followed by a briefing by the ship’s underwater
disposers on the procedures for disposal. They were also
trained on various equipment on board the ship.
It remains vital that Japan and Vietnam strengthen
their relationship in order to achieve more concrete and
practical cooperation, based on the memorandum on defense
cooperation and exchanges.

**Exchanges**

a. Overview

In November 2019, Defense Minister Kono held a meeting
with Minister of National Defense Jeong Kyeong-doo on
the occasion of the 6th ADMM-Plus. Defense Minister
Kono stated that Japan-ROK bilateral relations as well as
the trilateral relations between Japan, the ROK and the U.S.
are extremely significant in the severe security environment
surrounding Japan and the ROK although the defense
relations between the two countries have been extremely
sour because of various bilateral issues since 2018. The
two Ministers agreed that the two defense authorities would
continue their communication.
b. Japan-ROK GSOMIA

Based on the Trilateral Information Sharing Arrangement
Concerning the Nuclear and Missile Threats Posed by North
Korea signed in December 2014, the defense authorities in
Japan and the ROK have exchanged and shared classified
information regarding North Korea’s nuclear weapons and
missiles via the United States. In light of the increasingly
serious situation surrounding North Korea with its frequently
repeated ballistic missile launches and nuclear tests, in
November 2016, the GSOMIA was concluded between Japan
and the ROK to further promote bilateral cooperation. This
agreement serves as a framework to appropriately protect
classified military information shared between the Japanese
and ROK governments. In August 2019, the Government of
the ROK notified the Government of Japan of its intention to
terminate the GSOMIA in writing. However, in November
2019, the ROK government notified Japan about the

**(3) Japan-U.S.-ROK Cooperative Relationship**

Since Japan, the United States, and the ROK share common
interests pertaining to the peace and stability of this region,
it is important for the three countries to seize opportunities
to promote close cooperation in addressing various security
issues, including those regarding North Korea.
Japan, the United States, and the ROK have conducted a
Trilateral Defense Ministerial Meeting on the sidelines of the
Shangri-La Dialogue. In June 2019, then Defense Minister
Iwaya, ROK Minister of National Defense Jeong Kyeongdoo, and then U.S. Acting Secretary of Defense Patrick
Shanahan convened the Trilateral Defense Ministerial
Meeting. The three Ministers recognized the international
community’s shared goal of North Korea’s full compliance
with its international obligations in accordance with all
relevant UN Security Council Resolutions, which call for
North Korea’s complete denuclearization in a verifiable
and irreversible manner. They underscored commitment
to cooperation and coordination with the international
community for fully implementing UN Security Council
Resolutions, including sustained international cooperation
to deter, disrupt, and ultimately eliminate North Korea’s
illicit ship-to-ship transfers. Regarding regional security
issues, the Ministers reaffirmed that freedom of navigation
and overflight must be ensured, and that all disputes should
be resolved in a peaceful manner in accordance with the
principles of international law. Based on this view, they
shared the recognition of strengthening security cooperation
between Japan, the United States and the ROK. At the JapanU.S.-ROK Defense Ministerial Meeting held by Defense
Minister Kono, ROK Minister of National Defense Jeong
Kyeong-doo, and U.S. Secretary of Defense Mark Esper
on the occasion of the 6th ADMM-Plus in November 2019,
the three ministers committed to further trilateral security
cooperation, including information sharing, high-level
policy consultation, and bilateral/multilateral exercises,

calls for North Korea’s complete denuclearization as well
as the abandonment of ballistic missiles in a verifiable and
irreversible manner, North Korea’s full compliance with its
international obligations in accordance with all relevant UN
Security Council Resolutions, and the importance of a rulesbased order.
At the working level, the three countries have coordinated
with each other while closely sharing information through
such opportunities as Director-General and Director level
meetings, video conferences, and chief-of-staff level
meetings based on the framework of the Japan-U.S.-ROK
Defense Trilateral Talks (DTT). In May 2020, a plenary
meeting of Director-Generals was held in the form of a
video-teleconference. The representatives of the three
countries engaged in consultation on the North Korean
nuclear and missile threat, regional security, the coronavirus
pandemic, and substantive ways to strengthen trilateral
security cooperation.
As for service-to-service exchange, the Chief of Staff, JS
visited the United States in October 2019 to participate in the
Japan-U.S.-ROK chiefs of staff meeting. At this meeting, the
Chief of Joint Staff, U.S. Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff
Milley, and ROK Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff Park
discussed trilateral defense cooperation from the viewpoint
of promoting the peace and stability of Northeast Asia. Also,
in July 2019, the Chief of Joint Staff and members of the
GSDF Chemical School participated in Eastern Endeavour
19, an ROK-hosted Proliferation Security Initiative (PSI)
training exercise held in Busan. In addition to the MOD/

as information sharing between the two countries. At the
Japan-U.K. Summit Meeting in May 2014, prime ministers
of both countries agreed to hold a Japan-U.K. “2+2” Foreign
and Defence Ministerial Meeting and begin negotiations
on the ACSA in order to enhance bilateral cooperation in
the security field. In January 2017, the Japan-U.K. ACSA[8]

was signed. After the approval by Japan’s National Diet
in April 2017, the ACSA entered into force in August. At
the same time, relevant domestic laws were developed.
The effectuation of the Japan-U.K. ACSA enables the two
countries to implement the mutual provision of supplies
and services, such as water, food, fuel and transportation,
between the SDF and U.K. Armed Forces through unified
procedures in bilateral exercises and large-scale disaster
relief operations, further facilitating and strengthening the
Japan-U.K. strategic partnership. The Japan-U.K. Joint
Declaration on Security Cooperation, issued during the
Japan-U.K. Summit Meeting in August 2017, stipulated
that the two countries agreed to develop an action plan with
specific measures relating to bilateral security cooperation
between the relevant authorities. At the Japan-U.K. Summit
Meeting in January 2019, the leaders reaffirmed the above
Declaration and confirmed that the bilateral relationship
had entered the next phase. At the third Japan-U.K. “2+2”
Meeting in December 2017, the two countries issued a joint
statement, which referred to bilateral exercises between the
GSDF and U.K. Army, British naval ships’ deployment to
the Indo-Pacific region and bilateral exercises with the
SDF, and progress of the joint research on new air-to-air
missiles. In addition, in November 2019, Defense Minister

as well as international peace cooperation activities. In this
regard, promoting defense cooperation and exchanges with
these countries provides the foundations for Japan to become
actively involved in dealing with these challenges and this is
important for all of Japan, European countries, Canada, and
New Zealand.

**(1) The United Kingdom**

The United Kingdom, being a major power that has influence
not only in Europe but also in the rest of the world, has
historically maintained close relations with Japan. On the

security front, Japan shares the same strategic interests
as the United Kingdom, as both countries are important
allies of the United States. Given this relationship, it is
extremely important for Japan to promote cooperation with

**(1) Significance of Defense Cooperation and Exchanges with**
**China**

A stable relation between Japan and China is an essential
factor for the peace and stability of the Indo-Pacific region.
From broad and medium- to long-term perspectives, it is
necessary for both countries to strive to build and enhance
the “Mutually Beneficial Relationship Based on Common
Strategic Interests with China” in all areas, including security.
In the security field, in order to enhance mutual
understanding and trust, the MOD/SDF will promote multilayered dialogues and exchanges with China. In doing so,
Japan will continue to encourage China to play a responsible
and constructive role for peace and stability in the IndoPacific region, comply with international norms of conduct,
and improve transparency regarding military capability
enhancement in the context of its rapidly increasing defense
budget. Moreover, in order to avoid unexpected situations,
Japan will utilize the Maritime and Aerial Communication
Mechanism between the Defense Authorities of Japan and
China in a manner that contributes to building a trusting
relationship between the two countries.

**(2) Recent Major Achievements in Defense Exchanges**

Japan-China defense exchanges stagnated following the
Japanese government’s acquisition of ownership of the three
Senkaku Islands (Uotsurijima Island, Kitakojima Island,
and Minamikojima Island) in September 2012, but have
gradually resumed since the latter half of 2014.
In November 2015 Japan-China Defense Ministerial

a half years, attended a high-level symposium held on the
sideline of the Fleet Review. On this occasion, the MSDF
Chief of Staff conveyed the importance of free and open seas.
Following this, in October 2019, the Chinese navy guidedmissile destroyer “Taiyuan” became the fi rst Chinese naval
vessel to visit Japan in about 10 years, and conducted the third
goodwill training with an SDF destroyer, which was the fi rst
such training in about eight years.
As for unit-to-unit exchanges, a delegation from the Eastern
Theater Command, headed by the deputy commander, visited
Japan in November 2018, followed by a delegation from the
SDF, led by the Western Army commanding General, visiting
the Eastern Theater Command and other areas in November
2019. In 2018, the Japan-China fi eld-grade offi cer exchange
program hosted by Japan’s Sasakawa Peace Foundation
was held for the fi rst time in six years. In April 2018 and


September 2019, the Chinese delegation consisting of fi eldgrade offi cers of the People’s Liberation Army visited Japan,
in addition, the Japanese delegation consisting of fi eld-grade
offi cers of the SDF visited China in September 2018 and
April 2019, The Japanese delegate paid courtesy calls to
important persons and visited military units etc.
In efforts to build a “Mutually Benefi cial Relationship
Based on Common Strategic Interests,” Japan and China
must strive to promote confi dential relations and mutual
understanding through dialogue at various levels in various
areas and must proactively step up concrete cooperation and
exchange in non-traditional security areas, such as counterpiracy measures.

**(3) Maritime and Aerial Communication Mechanism between**
**the Defense Authorities of Japan and China**

At Japan-China Summit Meetings in January and April 2007,
then Japanese Prime Minister Abe and Chinese Premier Wen
Jiabao agreed to develop a mechanism for communications,
particularly maritime communications, between the two
countries’ defense authorities. Based on the agreement,
their defense authorities held the first Joint Working Group
Meeting on the mechanism in April 2008 and accumulated
talks. From the fourth Joint Working Group Meeting in
January 2015, diplomatic authorities of both countries joined
the negotiations.
After the eighth meeting of the Japan-China High-Level
Consultation on Maritime Affairs in December 2017 and the
seventh Joint Working Group Meeting in April 2018, Japanese
and Chinese defense authorities signed the memorandum[9] on
the mechanism in the presence of Japanese Prime Minister
Abe and Chinese Premier Li Keqiang on the occasion of the
Japan-China Summit Meeting in Tokyo in May 2018, and the
operation of this mechanism commenced on June 8, 2018.
The “Maritime and Aerial Communication Mechanism
between the Defense Authorities of Japan and China” has
been developed (1) to promote mutual understanding and
confidence between Japan and China and to enhance bilateral
defense cooperation and exchange; (2) to avoid unexpected
collisions; and (3) to prevent unforeseen circumstances
in the sea and air from developing into military clashes
or political or diplomatic issues. The mechanism’s main
components include (1) annual and expert meetings between
the two countries’ defense authorities; (2) a hotline between
Japanese and Chinese defense authorities; and (3) on scene
communication measures between vessels and aircraft of the
SDF and the People’s Liberation Army.
Under the mechanism, the first annual and expert meetings
were held between the defense authorities in December
2018, and the second annual and experts’ meetings were
held in January 2020, to exchange views on the maritime
security policies of the two countries, the operational status
and improvement of the mechanism, as well as to coordinate
the establishment of a hotline. At the Japan-China Defense
Ministerial Meeting in December 2019, the ministers
also confirmed that the mechanism has been operating
appropriately since its inception and has played an important
role in building trust between the defense authorities of
Japan and China and avoiding contingencies in the field. The
ministers also agreed to accelerate efforts to establish the
hotline as soon as possible.

**(1) Significance of Defense Cooperation and Exchange with**
**Russia**

Given that Russia is a key security player in the Indo-Pacific
region and an important country neighboring Japan, it is
very important for Japan to promote confidential relations
with Russia through bilateral defense exchanges. As
Japan-Russia relations have continuously been developing
in a wide range of areas, the MOD/SDF has continuously
conducted Japan-Russia “2+2” Meetings and various
dialogues with Russian defense authorities according to
the Memorandum on Japan-Russia Defense Exchanges
signed in 1999 (revised in 2006), annual meetings based
on the Japan-Russia Agreement on Prevention of Incidents
on and over the High Seas,[10] and bilateral search and
rescue exercises.
The Government of Japan deals with the relationships
with Russia appropriately while emphasizing the solidarity
of the G7 (Group of Seven), taking the Ukrainian situation
and other factors into account. At the same time, it is
important to maintain constant contacts with Russia, as
one of Japan’s neighbors, at the working level to avoid
unforeseen circumstances or unnecessary conflicts. The
MOD considers these points in a comprehensive manner and
advances defense exchanges with Russia accordingly.

states welcomed “Vientiane Vision 2.0” and expressed their
expectations towards promotion of even more practical
Japan-ASEAN defense cooperation in future under the
updated vision.
The Vientiane Vision presents an overall picture of
the priority areas of the future direction of ASEAN-wide
defense cooperation in a transparent manner. Vientiane
Vision 2.0 retains the basic framework of the initial Vision,
including its objectives, direction, and means of cooperation,
but introduces three new pillars: firstly, establishing three
principles of Japan-ASEAN cooperation which are “heartto-heart cooperation”, “tailored and lasting cooperation”
and “equal and open cooperation”; secondly, introducing
the concept of “resilience” to clarify the connection between
our efforts and ASEAN’s centrality and unity; and thirdly,
pursuing synergies between the ASEAN Outlook on the
Indo-Pacific (AOIP) announced by ASEAN in June 2018
and Japan’s FOIP.
In the field of HA/DR, since 2018, Japan has held the
Japan-ASEAN Invitation Program on HA/DR. In February
2019, Japan held the second round of the invitation program,
inviting participants from all ASEAN member states and
the ASEAN Secretariat. In this program, a seminar on the
Japanese large-scale disaster response guidelines and the first
table-top exercise were conducted.
In the field of international law, in November 2018, Japan
invited all ASEAN member states and the ASEAN Secretariat

active contributions to this forum. At an Inter-Sessional
Meeting on Maritime Security (ISM on MS) that has been
held since 2009,[17] for example, Japan has taken leadership
in formulating a collection of best practices concerning
assistance for capacity building in the field of maritime
security. In the field of disaster relief, the MOD/SDF has
dispatched SDF personnel and aircraft to ARF Disaster

Defense Forum) every year since 1996 for senior officials
in charge of defense policy (Director-General level officials
and general-level officers) from the countries in the region
to discuss defense policies of the participating countries and
confidence-building measures in the field of defense.
In November 219, as an effort to strengthen relations with
international students who had graduated from the National
Defense Academy (NDA), a gathering was held for the first
time with about 50 international students who had graduated
from the main course of the NDA. Defense Minister Kono
also joined this gathering.
Since 2002, Japan has invited people engaging in the field
of security policy from Asia-Pacific countries to Japan as
opinion leaders, in order to foster understanding of Japan’s
security and defense policies and the situation of the SDF.

during which seminars on international maritime law and
HA/DR at sea and a table top exercise on HA/DR at Sea,
were also conducted to improve their knowledge of maritime
security.
Through these initiatives, Japan has worked to promote
capacity building, mutual understanding, and network
building with participants from all ASEAN member states
through seminars and training programs in various areas,
including maritime security and HA/DR, while also fostering
a shared recognition about international law, which has
contributed to the stability of the Indo-Pacific region.

b. International Conferences Hosted by Private Organizations

International conferences on security include not only intergovernmental conferences but also meetings organized
by private organizations in which various people, such as
government officials, scholars, and journalists, participate
to discuss medium- to long- term security issues. Major
international conferences organized by private bodies include
the IISS Asia Security Summit (Shangri-La Dialogue),[18] IISS
Regional Security Summit (Manama Dialogue),[19] and the
Munich Security Conference,[20] one of the most prestigious

from Jordan, Bahrain, and Yemen. In his speech at the 15th
Manama Dialogue in November 2019, Defense Minister
Kono stated that Japan has continuously contributed to peace
and stability in the Middle East based on an understanding
that an open and secure maritime order provides the basis
for a stable and prosperous international community, and that
the SDF is forging broader and closer ties with this Middle
East through human contributions to maritime security in
the region, participation in exercises, defense equipment
cooperation, person-to-person links, and other initiatives. He
also stated that Japan attaches importance to the freedom of
navigation and the rule of law at sea, and that in order to
ensure the safety of Japan-related ships and also to secure
the peace and stability of the Middle East region, Japan has
started to consider how we can best utilize the assets of the
SDF as our independent efforts to reinforce our information
gathering.


In December 2019, Defense Minister Kono also attended
the 19th Doha Forum organized by the Government of Qatar
for the first time as a defense minister. He held bilateral

In his speech on multilateral security cooperation, Defense
Minister Kono expressed concern over the strengthening
of North Korea’s military capabilities, including its nuclear
and missile capabilities. He also stated that it is necessary to
reinforce arms control and disarmament and the rule of law
in the international community, and that Japan is working
with other countries to promote FOIP through bilateral/
multilateral exercises, capacity building, and defense
equipment and technology cooperation based on the rule of
law. He cited Vientiane Vision 2.0 as an example of Japan’s
multilateral security cooperation efforts, and said that Japan
would continue to promote multilateral security cooperation.

**2 Promoting Practical Multilateral Security**
Cooperation Initiatives


**(1) Pacific Partnership**

The Pacific Partnership (PP), which started in 2007, is an
initiative in which naval vessels, primarily those from the
U.S. Navy, visit countries in the Asia-Pacific region to
provide medical care, conduct facility repair activities,
and engage in cultural exchange to strengthen cooperation
between countries participating in the initiative and
facilitate international peace cooperation activities through
cooperation with governments, military forces, international
organizations, and non-governmental organizations (NGOs)
in those countries. Japan has dispatched SDF medical
personnel and units under the Pacific Partnership since 2007.
In 2019, Japan dispatched medical personnel to the Marshall
Islands and Vietnam, in addition to sending its music band
members to the Marshall Islands, for medical activities and
cultural exchanges. Moreover, Japan also sent lecturers on
women’s studies, peace, and security in Timor-Leste.

**(2) Multilateral Exercises**
a. Significance of Multilateral Exercises in the Indo-Pacific
Region

In the Indo-Pacific region, the MOD/SDF has actively
participated in multilateral training and exercises in nontraditional security fields, such as HA/DR and Non-combatant
Evacuation Operation (NEO), in addition to traditional
training conducted in preparation for combat situations. It is
important to participate in such multilateral exercises so as
not only to raise the skill level of the SDF, but also to create a
cooperative platform with relevant countries. In light of this
perspective, the MOD/SDF intends to continue to actively
engage in such training.

**Ensuring Maritime Security**

The NDPG states that for Japan, a maritime nation,
strengthening the order of “Open and Stable Oceans” based
on fundamental norms, such as the rule of law and the
freedom of navigation, as well as ensuring safe maritime and
air transport, is the foundation for its peace and prosperity,
which is extremely important. From this viewpoint, the
MOD/SDF will promote assistance that contributes to
improving capabilities pertaining to the maritime security


of coastal states in the Indo-Pacifi c region, such as India,
Sri Lanka, and other South and Southeast Asian states.
Moreover, Japan is promoting such activities as joint training
and exercises, unit-to-unit exchanges, and active port visits
on these occasions. Japan is also promoting activities such
as anti-piracy efforts in cooperation with relevant countries
and cooperation for strengthening the capabilities of the
Maritime Domain Awareness (MDA).

However, in cases where it is deemed extremely diffi cult or

Piracy is a grave threat to public safety and order on the

it is an important issue that cannot be ignored. The Japan

important sea lanes, connecting Europe and the Middle East
with East Asia. Successive UN Security Council resolutions[1]

were adopted, such as UN Security Council Resolution 1816,
which was adopted in June 2008 in response to the frequent
occurrence of and rapid increase in the piracy incidents with
the purpose of acquiring ransoms by detaining hostages
caused by pirates, who are armed with machine guns and
rocket launchers. These resolutions have requested that
various countries take actions, particularly the dispatch of
warships and military aircraft, to deter piracy in the waters
off the coast of Somalia and in the Gulf of Aden.
To date, approximately 30 countries, including the United
States, have dispatched their warships to the waters off the
coast of Somalia and in the Gulf of Aden. As part of its counterpiracy initiatives, the EU has been conducting Operation
Atalanta since December 2008, in addition to the counterpiracy operations conducted by the Combined Task Force 151
(CTF 151)[2] that was established in January 2009. Meanwhile,
other countries have been dispatching their assets to the area.
As these initiatives by the international community have
proved to be effective, the number of acts of piracy occurring
in the waters off the coast of Somalia and in the Gulf of Aden
has currently hovered at a low level. However, the assumed
root causes of piracy such as terrorism and poverty in Somalia
have still remained unsolved. In addition, considering the
fact that Somalia’s capability to crack down on piracy is also
still insuffi cient, if the international community reduces its
counter-piracy efforts, the situation could be easily reversed.
Therefore, there is no great change in the situation in which
Japan must carry out its counter-piracy operations.

**2 Japanese Initiatives**


**(1) Legislation Concerning Counter-Piracy Operations**

In March 2009, following the order for Maritime Security
Operations for the purpose of protecting Japan-affi liated
vessels from acts of piracy in the waters off the coast of
Somalia and in the Gulf of Aden, two destroyers[3] began
providing direct escort to Japan-affi liated vessels, while P-3C
patrol aircraft also commenced warning and surveillance
operations in June of the same year.
Japan subsequently enacted the Anti-Piracy Measures Act[4]

in July of the same year. This act made it possible to protect
the vessels of all nations from acts of piracy, regardless of
their fl ag states. Moreover, it also enabled the use of weapons
to a reasonable extent, if no other means were available,
in order to halt vessels engaging in acts of piracy, such as
approaching civilian vessels.
Furthermore, the Act on Special Measures concerning the
Security of Japanese Flagged Vessels in Areas that Are Highly
Susceptible to Acts of Piracy came into force on November
2013, which made it possible to have security guards on
board a Japanese ship provided certain requirements are met,
enabling them to carry small arms for the purpose of security
operations.

**(2) Activities by the SDF**
a. Dispatch of the Deployment Surface Force for Counter Piracy
Enforcement (DSPE) and Other Units

The SDF dispatches the DSPE, the Deployment Air Force for
Counter Piracy Enforcement (DAPE), and the Deployment
Support Group for Counter Piracy Enforcement (DGPE) to
carry out counter-piracy operations.
The DSPE strives to ensure the safety of ships navigating
in the area in two different manners – direct escort of private
vessels across the Gulf of Aden, and zone defense in allocated
areas in the Gulf of Aden, by using destroyers (one destroyer
dispatched). There are JCG officers aboard the destroyer.[5]

The DAPE conducts counter-piracy activities using
the P-3C patrol aircraft (two aircraft dispatched). The unit
conducts warning and surveillance operations in the flight
zone that is determined in coordination with the CTF 151
Headquarters and confirms any suspicious boats. At the
same time, the unit also provides information to the MSDF
destroyers, the naval vessels of other countries and civilian
vessels, responding by such means as confirming the safety
of the surrounding area immediately, if requested. The
information gathered by MSDF P-3Cs is constantly shared
with other related organizations, and contributes significantly
to deterring acts of piracy and disarming vessels suspected as
pirate ships.
In order to improve the operational efficiency and
effectiveness of the DAPE, the DGPE carries out activities
such as maintenance of the facility set up in the northwest
district of Djibouti International Airport.
In addition, the Airlift Squadron regularly operates ASDF
transport aircraft to carry out air transport of materials
required by the DAPE and the DGPE.
In late April, although COVID-19 had spread in Djibouti,
in order to conduct regular inspection and maintenance
of P-3C patrol aircraft in Japan, a substitute P-3C was
dispatched after closely coordinating with related authorities
and implementing thorough measures to prevent infection.
b. CTF 151 Deployed Unit at the Headquarters

In order to strengthen coordination with the units of other
countries engaged in counter-piracy operations and enhance
the effectiveness of the SDF’s counter-piracy operations,
the MOD has dispatched SDF personnel to the CTF 151
Headquarters since August 2014. During the period from
May to August 2015, the SDF also dispatched a CTF 151


commander for the first time, while between March and June
2017, March and June 2018, and February and June 2020, a
CTF 151 commander as well as staff were also dispatched to
the Headquarters.
c. Achievements

As of March 31, 2020, the DSPE has escorted 4,027 vessels.
Under the protection of the SDF destroyers, not a single
vessel has come to any harm from pirates and these vessels
have all passed safely across the Gulf of Aden.
As of May 31, 2020, the DAPE has conducted the
following activities: aircraft have flown 2,486 missions with
their flying hours totaling 18,570 hours; and information was
provided to vessels navigating the area and other countries
engaging in counter-piracy operations on around 14,600
occasions. The activities conducted by the DAPE account
for approximately 70 to 80% of the warning and surveillance
operations carried out in the Gulf of Aden by the international
community.

**Chapter**


**3 Praise for Japan’s Endeavors**

The counter-piracy operations by the SDF have been highly
praised by the international community. For example,
national leaders and others have expressed their gratitude
and the SDF has also been repeatedly well-received by the
UN Security Council Resolution. Moreover, the MSDF
destroyers, which are engaging in counter-piracy operations
off the coast of Somalia and in the Gulf of Aden, has received
many messages from the captains and ship owners of the
vessels that its units have escorted, expressing their gratitude
that the ships were able to cross the Gulf of Aden with
peace of mind and asking them to continue escorting ships
there. Additionally, The Japanese Shipowners’ Association
and other groups expressed appreciation for protection of
Japan-related vessels and asked for continuation of efforts in
fighting against piracy.

**❸ [Training-Centered Initiatives ]**

The MSDF not only endeavors to enhance its tactical skills
through joint training with coastal states alongside sea
lanes, but also strives to contribute to peace and stability
in the Indo-Pacific region, promote mutual understanding,
and strengthen relationships of trust. In the Indo-Pacific
Deployment which was implemented from April to July
2019, Destroyer JS “Izumo” and other deployed units
conducted a total of eleven bilateral/multilateral and friendly
drills, including the ADMM-Plus Maritime Security Field
Exercise and the Japan-France-Australia-US quadrilateral

**❹ [Cooperation in Maritime Security ]**

The MOD/SDF has implemented capacity building in
maritime security for Myanmar, Thailand, Malaysia,
Vietnam, Indonesia, the Philippines and Sri Lanka to help
them enhance their MDA and other capabilities. Such
program contributes to strengthening cooperation with
partner countries that share common strategic interests with
Japan.
The Basic Plan on Ocean Policy, which was approved
by a Cabinet decision in May 2018, calls for strengthening
cooperation related to maritime security with various
countries through security dialogue and defense interaction
among defense authorities at bilateral and multilateral levels
with the aim of maintaining and advancing “free and open


exercise La Perouse, while actively making port calls on the
way to and back from counter-piracy operations.
Strengthening cooperation with coastal states of the IndoPacific region through the bilateral exercise and port calls
contributes to the maintenance of maritime security, which
has extremely high significance.

seas” supported by a maritime order defined by laws and
rules. In response to this, the MOD has been working on
cooperation for maritime security within regional security
dialogue frameworks such as the ADMM-Plus and the ISM
on MS.

**Section**

**Cooperation in Use of Space and Cyber Domains**

**3**


In the international community, there is a broadening and
diversifying array of security challenges that cannot be dealt
with by a single country alone. Rapid expansion in the use of
space and cyber domains is poised to fundamentally change
the existing paradigm of national security, which makes the
establishment of international rules and norms a security
agendum. The MOD/SDF will swiftly achieve superiority
in space and cyber domains by strengthening coordination

**❶ [Cooperation in the Use of Space Domain ]**

Regarding the use of the space domain, Japan will promote
partnership and cooperation in various fi elds including
SSA and mission assurance of the entire space system,
through consultations and information sharing with relevant
countries and active participation in multilateral exercises
among others.
The MOD/SDF has taken part in the annual Space
Situational Awareness (SSA) multinational tabletop exercise
(Global Sentinel) and the Schriever Wargame, a multinational
tabletop exercise on space security, hosted by the U.S. Forces
and is working to share the recognition of threats in space
among multiple countries and acquire knowledge related
to cooperation regarding SSA and mission assurance of the
space system.


and cooperation with relevant countries through information
sharing, consultation, exercise, and capacity building,
while promoting measures concerning the development of
international norms.

opinions on space policy. With France, based on the
agreement to strengthen bilateral dialogue on space at the
Japan-France Foreign and Defense Ministers' Meeting in
March 2015, the two countries decided to start the JapanFrance Comprehensive Space Dialogue. At the 2nd JapanFrance Comprehensive Space Dialogue in March 2017, in
order to strengthen bilateral cooperation on SSA, the two
countries signed a technical arrangement on information
sharing pertaining to space situation awareness between the
competent authority of Japan and the Minister of Defense
of the Republic of France, and agreed to promote specifi c
cooperation initiatives. With the EU, it was decided to
start the Japan-EU Space Policy Dialogue at the Japan-EU
Summit in May 2014, and four dialogue sessions have been
held. At the Japan-India summit meeting in October 2018,
the two countries decided to start space dialogue between the
governments, and the MOD participated in the fi rst meeting
held in March 2019.

See  Section 1-2 of this Chapter (Promotion of Defense
Cooperation and Exchanges)


**Chapter**


See  Chapter 2, Section 2 (Strengthening Ability of Japan-U.S.
Alliance to Deter and Counter Threats)

The MOD/SDF is also working on cooperation with
countries other than the United States. For example, the
Japan-Australia Space Security Dialogue and Japan-U.S.Australia Space Security Dialogue are held to exchange


**❷ [Cooperation in the Use of Cyber Domain ]**

Regarding the use of the cyber domain, Japan will enhance
its partnership and cooperation with relevant countries
through measures such as sharing views on threat awareness,
exchanging views on response to cyber attacks, and
participating in multilateral exercises.
The MOD has held cyber dialogues with the respective
defense authorities of Australia, the United Kingdom,
Germany, Estonia, and others to exchange views on threat
awareness and relevant initiatives taken by each country.


With NATO, the MOD carries out initiatives looking at
possible future operational cooperation, such as establishing
a cyber dialogue between defense authorities called the
Japan-NATO Expert Staff Talks on Cyber Defense and in
December 2019, offi cially participating for the fi rst time
in the cyber defense exercise Cyber Coalition 2019 hosted
by NATO, in which Japan had participated as an observer.
Furthermore, Japan has participated in the International
Conference on Cyber Confl ict (CyCon) and has participated

as an observer in a cyber defense exercise (Locked Shields),
both organized by the CCDCOE based in Estonia. The MOD
is further developing collaborative relationships with NATO
in the cyber domain through the dispatch of personnel to the
Centre since March 2019.
In addition, IT Forums have been held between the defense
authorities of Singapore, Vietnam, and Indonesia to exchange
views on initiatives in the information communications area
including cybersecurity and current trends in technology. The
MOD has been expanding the cooperation by implementing
cybersecurity human resource development seminars
for Vietnamese Forces as part of its capacity building in
December 2017, March and August 2019, and January 2020.

See Section 1-2 of this Chapter (Promotion of Defense

Cooperation and Exchanges)
Section 1-4 of this Chapter (Proactive and Strategic Initiatives
for Capacity Building)


**Chapter**


Considering the fact that cyber attacks occur beyond
national borders, it is important to continue to strengthen
international cooperation in the cyber field through exchanges
of views with defense authorities of other countries and
relevant organizations such as the CCDCOE, and active
participation in cyber defense exercises.

164 GSDF officers have been dispatched to Africa to provide
nine training sessions for a total of 277 members from eight
African countries.
Considering that 30% or more of PKO personnel are from
Asia, Japan decided to implement the project for the first time
in Asia and the surrounding regions. The project provides
training on heavy engineering equipment operation for
engineering personnel. Trial training took place in Vietnam
from November to December 2018 for 16 personnel from
nine countries in Asia and the surrounding regions, including
Vietnam and Indonesia. Following this, from November
to December 2019 and from February to March 2020, the
GSDF provided heavy equipment operation training for 40
personnel from five countries in Asia and the surrounding
region, including Vietnam, Indonesia and Nepal.
In addition, the UN decided to extend the scope of
support under this project to the field of sanitation, given
that strengthening sanitation capacity to ensure the safety of
deployed personnel has become an issue in UN peacekeeping
operations. In response, the UN Field Medical Assistant
Course (UNFMAC), which aims to train personnel who can
provide first aid before medics or medical personnel provide
specialized treatment in areas of PKO operations, was
implemented in October 2019. In the course, eight instructors,
including two GSDF officers, trained 29 personnel at the UN
Regional Service Centre Entebbe in Uganda.

**Chapter**


Responding to specific relief requests by the governments of
affected countries and the scale of disaster situations in these
countries, the SDF’s capabilities in international disaster
relief activities encompass (1) medical services, such as firstaid medical treatment and epidemic prevention; (2) transport
of relief items, patients and personnel by helicopter and other
means; and (3) water supply activities using water-purifying
devices. In addition, the SDF uses transport aircraft and
ships to carry disaster relief personnel and equipment to the
affected area.
The Ground Component Command regional units of
the GSDF and other relevant GSDF units maintain their
readiness to ensure that they can carry out international
disaster relief activities in an independent manner anytime
when needed. The Self Defense Fleet of the MSDF and Air
Support Command of the ASDF also constantly maintain
their readiness to transport personnel and their supplies to
disaster affected areas. Furthermore, in April 2015, the
MOD/SDF also improved its readiness to be able to swiftly
respond to a request for search activities using P-3C patrol
aircraft.

employment upturn, as well as the advancement of declining
birthrate and popularization of higher education, the environment
surrounding the recruitment of uniformed SDF personnel is
severe. In such a situation, it is necessary for the MOD/SDF to
recruit qualifi ed human resources with a strong desire to join
the SDF, by suffi ciently explaining to them the missions, roles,
duties, welfare programs, and privileges of the SDF.
For this reason, the MOD/SDF holds recruiting meetings
at schools and also maintains Provincial Cooperation
Offi ces in 50 locations throughout Japan to respond to the
individual needs of applicants, with the understanding

personnel was raised from “under 27” to “under 33” in 2018
in order to secure diverse human resources from a broader
range, including people with work experience in private

uniformed SDF personnel started in 2020 in order to ensure
quality improvement of uniformed SDF personnel in fi xed

Fig. IV-1-1-2 (Overview of Appointment System for SDF
Personnel)

Personnel management of uniformed SDF personnel
differs from that of general civilian government employees,[1]

due to the uniqueness of their duties and the need to
maintain the SDF’s strength. With consideration given to
the knowledge, experience, physical strength and other
factors necessary for the duties of the respective ranks, the
SDF has“Early Retirement System” where the majority of
personnel retire in their mid-50s and “Fixed Term System”
where one term is two or three years.


After employment, uniformed SDF personnel are assigned
their branch of service and duties at units all around Japan,
in accordance with their choice or aptitude, following basic
education and training at respective training units or schools
of respective SDF services.

SDF Personnel and Changes in Them)

Candidates for SDF Reserve Personnel

It is essential to secure the required number of uniformed
SDF personnel promptly depending on situational changes in
the event of a crisis. To secure the required number promptly
and systematically, the MOD maintains the following three
systems: the SDF Reserve Personnel system, the SDF Ready
Reserve Personnel system, and the Candidates for SDF
Reserve Personnel system.[2]

Notes:1 Staff candidates for the medicine, dentistry, and pharmacy faculties will be promoted to the position of First Lieutenant if they pass the national examinations in medicine and complete the

prescribed education and training.
2 General candidate for enlistment (upper) refers to a candidate who has been enlisted with the premise that he/she will be promoted to a fixed-term position of “Enlisted (upper).” Until
FY2006, there were two programs consisting of “Student candidates for enlistment (upper)” and “Enlisted (upper) candidates.” However, these two programs were reorganized and
combined, and since FY2007, candidates have been appointed as “General candidates for enlistment (upper).”
3 As for the candidate for uniformed SDF personnel, in order to enhance the initial education of SDF personnel in fixed-term service, in July 2010, it was decided that their status during the
first three months of their enlistment would be as non-SDF personnel, and they would engage exclusively in fundamental education and training as non-regular Ministry of Defense
personnel.
4 GSDF High Technical School trains people to be SDF personnel who will be capable not only of operating and making full use of equipment in the GSDF but also of conducting missions in
the international community. Starting from FY2010 appointments, the status of the school’s students was changed from SDF officer to “students,” which is a new non-regular status. New
students receive a high school diploma at the conclusion of a student course (three years) through distance learning. From the FY2011 appointments, a new recommendation system was
introduced in which those who are considered appropriate to be a GSDF High Technical School student are selected from among the candidates based on the recommendation of the
principal of their junior high school etc., in addition to the conventional general examination.
5 A three-year program ended in FY2013. A new four-year program was established at the Division of Nursing, National Defense Medical College, in FY2014.
6 For Aviation Cadets, the Maritime Self-Defense Force selects from persons 18 or above and under 23 in age and the Air Defense Force 18 or above and under 21 in age.
7. For students on loans, the SDF lends school expenses (54,000 yen per month) to students who major in medicine, dentistry, or science and engineering at a university or a graduate school (excluding
professional graduate schools) and have an intention to continue serving as SDF personnel after graduation (completion) by taking advantage of academic knowledge in their specialized fields.

VOICE Voice of an Active SDF Reserve Personnel and His Employer

Mr. INOKUCHI Masataka,

President, Chokuwakai Medical Corporation

Our hospital opened 17 years ago with the goal of contributing to and enhancing regional

medical care in Katsushika Ward, Tokyo. In order to further enhance the emergency care

system of the community, and in response to its designation as a disaster base hospital of

Tokyo, there is an urgent need to enhance our disaster medicine system. This is why we

invited Lieutenant Colonel Ohmomo. It is a great honor for his employer that he was called for

disaster relief activities in response to Typhoon Hagibis. Because he plays a central role in the

Recent photograph of the author

emergency medical care of the hospital, his absence affects the operations of many in the hospital

departments, but we adjusted the hospital system during his absence so that he could focus

entirely on his activities as SDF personnel without any anxiety. We can expect a positive effect from his love of Japan, discipline and

control over staff of other job categories. I am happy that we can serve Japan indirectly by employing an SDF Reserve Personnel

who works for the country.

Reserve Lieutenant Colonel OHMOMO Taketomo,

Tokyo Provincial Cooperation Offices

While working as a doctor, I wanted to serve the country through my profession and was

appointed as an SDF Reserve Personnel after serving as an SDF Reserve Candidate (technical).

It is my irreplaceable asset that I got to know many like-minded fellows through call training of

SDF Reserve Personnel and other occasions. At the call for the disaster relief in response to

Typhoon Hagibis, the president made adjustment for my absence, saying with a smile, “There Author providing an explanation on medical

are things that only you can do. Render service to the country.” In order to meet that support activities during the disaster relief

expectation, I made full efforts in the offi ce of medical offi cers, Ground Component Command

Headquarters. I would have not been able to carry out the activities without the understanding of my workplace and support by

people around me. It could not have been done with my own will alone. I am grateful to all staff involved. I will continue to study

hard in preparation for the day when I can support permanent SDF Personnel who are working hard on the front line to protect our

beautiful country that has nurtured us.The SDF Reserve Personnel System allows us to contribute to Japan using our occupational

ability. There are many like-minded people. Would you take the fi rst step and walk together with us?


Reserve Personnel become uniformed SDF personnel and are
assigned to carry out their mission together with incumbent
uniformed SDF personnel as part of frontline units following
the issuance of a defense call-up order or other orders.
Candidates for SDF Reserve Personnel, some of whom are
recruited among those with no prior experience as uniformed
SDF personnel, are appointed as SDF Reserve Personnel after
completing the necessary education and training.
As SDF Reserve Personnel and others work in their
civilian jobs under normal circumstances, they need to
adjust their work schedule to participate in periodic training
exercises. Therefore, understanding and cooperation from
the companies that employ these personnel are essential.
For this purpose the MOD provides a special subsidy to


the companies that employ SDF Ready Reserve Personnel
and take necessary measures to allow such employees to
attend training sessions for 30 days a year, by taking into
consideration the burden on such companies. Also, in 2017,
the MOD established a framework that allows the MOD/SDF
to provide such information as the scheduled term of a training
call-up and scheduled term during which SDF Reserve
Personnel/SDF Ready Reserve Personnel are called up to
perform actual operations and are appointed as uniformed SDF
personnel, when requested by their employers. In 2018, the
MOD established a system to provide a subsidy which aims
to contribute to securing understanding and cooperation from
the employers regarding the duties of SDF Reserve Personnel.
Under the system the employers are provided with a subsidy if


-----

(1) SDF Reserve Personnel or SDF Ready Reserve Personnel
respond to a defense operation call-up order, civil protection
dispatch call-up order, or disaster relief call-up order, etc. or
(2) if they have no choice but to leave their regular occupations
due to injuries during their duties, etc. In addition, a special
subsidy to the companies that cooperate with training of
SDF Ready Reserve Personnel was established in 2020. The
subsidy is paid to companies that employ people who, after
being a Candidate for SDF Reserve Personnel with no prior
experience as uniformed SDF personnel, are appointed as
SDF Ready Reserve Personnel after completing the necessary
education and training, and that take necessary measures to
allow such employees to attend training sessions.
SDF Ready Reserve Personnel were called up at the time of
the 2016 Kumamoto Earthquake[3], the 2018 July Heavy Rain,[4]
and the 2018 Hokkaido Eastern Iburi Earthquake,[5] while
SDF Ready Reserve Personnel and SDF Reserve Personnel
were called up at the time of the 2019 East Japan Typhoon
(Typhoon Hagibis).[6] They carried out their missions, including
transportation of goods and water supply. In 2020, in a disaster
relief mission to prevent infection of the novel coronavirus
disease (COVID19) from spreading, SDF Reserve Personnel
with medical qualification were called up and handled the
situation.[7] The MOD has been implementing various measures
to increase and enhance SDF Reserve Personnel and others
because SDF Reserve Personnel are anticipated to be called
up more often in response to earthquake and other disasters.
Specifically, recruitment and appointment were expanded
in 2018 to secure a wide variety of human resources from a
broader range. The upper age limit for recruitment of leading
privates and lower SDF Reserve Personnel was raised from

“under 37” to “under 55” and the upper age limit for their
continued appointment from “under 61” to “under 62.” An
upper age limit is not set for persons with a license for a
medical practitioner. Their continued appointment is approved
when it is confirmed that they properly maintain their medical
techniques and that there is no problem with their duties as
SDF Reserve Personnel. The upper age limit for recruitment of
leading privates and lower SDF Ready Reserve Personnel was
raised from “under 32” to “under 50.” In 2019 a new system


was established to appoint SDF Reserve Personnel without
experience in the SDF as SDF Ready Reserve Personnel after
certain education and training.
Also, the MOD promotes the use of SDF Reserve Personnel
in a wide range of fields, such as the appointment of retired
SDF pilots, who were reemployed in the private sector through
the re-employment system, as SDF Reserve Personnel.[8]により

任用するなど、幅広い分野で予備自衛官の活用を進めている。

(3) Administrative Officials, Technical and Engineering Officials,
Instructors, and Other Civilian Personnel

There are approximately 21,000 civilian personnel —
administrative officials, technical and engineering officials,
instructors, and others — in addition to uniformed SDF
personnel in the MOD/SDF.[9] Civilian personnel are mainly
recruited from those who have passed the Recruitment
Examination for Comprehensive and General Service
National Public Employees conducted by the National
Personnel Authority (NPA), and those who have passed the
Recruitment Examination for Ministry of Defense Specialists
conducted by the MOD. After participating in the common
training course, civilian personnel recruited in this process
work in a wide range of fields.
Administrative officials are engaged in defense-related
policy planning in the Internal Bureaus of the MOD and
at the Acquisition, Technology and Logistics Agency
(ATLA); analysis and evaluation at the Defense Intelligence
Headquarters; and administrative works at the SDF bases, the
Regional Defense Bureaus, and other locations throughout
the country.
Technical and engineering officials are working in the
Internal Bureaus of the MOD, the ATLA, the SDF bases, the
Regional Defense Bureaus, and other locations throughout
the country. They are engaged in constructing various defense
facilities (headquarters, runways, magazines, etc.), carrying
out research and development (R&D), efficient procurement,
maintenance and improvement of a range of equipment, as
well as providing mental health care for SDF personnel.
Instructors conduct advanced research on defense and
provide high-quality education to SDF personnel at the
National Institute for Defense Studies, the National Defense


**Chapter**


In response to the Kumamoto Earthquake in 2016, a call-up order for SDF Ready Reserve Personnel was issued, and approximately 160 Ready Reserve Personnel engaged in activities
such as livelihood support to the affected people.

In response to the heavy rain in July 2018, SDF Ready Reserve Personnel were called up. From July 12 to 30, approximately 310 SDF Ready Reserve Personnel engaged in life support and
activities, including removal of disaster waste.

At the time of the 2018 Hokkaido Eastern Iburi Earthquake, SDF Ready Reserve Personnel were called up. From September 8 to 23, approximately 250 SDF Ready Reserve Personnel
engaged in life support and other activities.

At the time of the 2019 East Japan Typhoon (Typhoon Hagibis), approximately 410 SDF Ready Reserve Personnel and SDF Reserve Personnel were called up and carried out life support
and other activities, including removal of disaster waste for the period from October 15 to November 9.

In a disaster relief mission against COVID-19 in 2020, 10 SDF Reserve Personnel with a medical qualification were called up and worked to prevent the disease from spreading for the
period from February 18 to March 12.

The reemployment system for SDF pilots aims to prevent the outflow of active young SDF pilots to civil aviation companies in an unregulated manner. This system is also designed to utilize
SDF pilots over a certain age as pilots of commercial airlines, and is also significant from the perspective of the development of the airline industry in Japan as a whole.

Among the employees of the MOD, special national government employees are called “SDF personnel,” including administrative officials, technical and engineering officials, instructors,

organizations.
In response to the “Directive for Organization and
Allocation of Personnel Expense in JFY2020 to Proceed with

Minister on July 31, 2019), which listed “development of

for providing education. In the event that personnel need to
further improve their professional knowledge and skills, or
that it is difficult for them to acquire such knowledge and
skills within the SDF, the MOD/SDF commissions education
to external institutions, including those abroad, as well as
domestic companies and research institutes. Furthermore,
based on the MTDP, in order to promote cross-domain joint
operations, the MOD/SDF will strengthen joint education
and standardize the curriculum, while at the same time
improving the education infrastructure for the utilization
of cutting-edge technology and expansion of recruitment
including female SDF personnel.

Enhancing the ability of the individual uniformed SDF

SDF training units and schools provide opportunities for

duties to nurture necessary qualities and instill knowledge
and skills.
A considerable extent of human, temporal, and economic

Contribution to Unit Merits are awarded to personnel
who worked hard on their duties and who contributed
to their unit with commendable achievements in
carrying out their duties.
Recognized personnel may wear Defensive
Meritorious Badges and Medals for Contribution to

**2 Improvement of Living and Work Environment and**
Treatment


To enable all SDF personnel to maintain high morale and
continue to fully exercise their ability, the NDPG and the
MTDP state that the MOD/SDF will improve living and work
environment. Specifically, the SDF will steadily renew aged
everyday life/workplace fixtures, secure the necessary quantities
of everyday necessities in addition to accelerating the securing
and reconstruction of the necessary barracks and housing, and
proceed with measures against aging and earthquake proofing of
facilities.
Because SDF personnel carry out their missions under a severe
environment, the SDF will improve their treatment based on the
special nature of their missions and work environment. Specifically,
in order to ensure appropriate treatment in accordance with the
risk and special nature of their missions and the characteristics
of the area of the office, the SDF will make improvements to
special work allowance,[10] etc. and procure portable beds and
better emergency rations to improve their ability to respond
to disasters. To enable SDF personnel to fulfill their missions
with high morale and pride, the MOD/SDF will improve their
treatment through measures concerning honors and privileges,
including the enhancement of the defensive meritorious badges to
appropriately acknowledge their achievements.
In light of the severe recruitment environment, the Act on
Remuneration, etc. of Ministry of Defense Personnel was revised
in 2019 to raise salaries with a focus on starting pay.

**3 Dealing with Retirement and Re-employment of**
SDF Personnel


**Chapter**


Improvement of living and work environment

Retired uniformed SDF personnel have excellent abilities in
planning, leadership, faculty, cooperativeness, and responsibility
gained through their work performance, education and training.
Furthermore, they have various qualifications and licenses
acquired through their duties and vocational training. Therefore,
they are making positive contributions in a broad range of
sectors, including manufacturing and service industries, as well
as finance, insurance, real estate, and construction industries, in
addition to the areas of disaster prevention and risk management
at local governments.
Based on the NDPG and MTDP, the MOD/SDF will strive
to further improve re-employment support by expanding
vocational training subjects and support for step-by-step
acquisition of qualifications before their retirement. The
MOD also strives to further utilize retired SDF personnel
while strengthening collaboration with local governments
and related organizations from the perspective of utilizing the
knowledge, skills, and experience of retired SDF personnel.
Specifically, as of the end of March 2020, a total of 575 retired
SDF personnel work as crisis management officers at local
governments’ disaster prevention bureaus—46 prefectural
bureaus have 102 of them in total, and 398 municipal
bureaus have 473. As this strengthens collaboration with
local governments and enhances the ability to deal with crisis
management, including disaster prevention, the MOD/SDF
will continue active support for the utilization of retired SDF
personnel in local governments’ disaster prevention bureaus
by further enhancing these efforts.


In order to maintain the strength of the SDF, many uniformed SDF
personnel retire in their mid-50s (personnel serving under the early
retirement system) or in their 20s to mid-30s (uniformed SDF
personnel serving under the fixed-term service system). Therefore,
many of them need to find another job after retirement in order to
secure their livelihoods.
Since supporting re-employment is the responsibility of the
Japanese Government (the MOD) as the employer, and is crucial
both for resolving any concerns that uniformed SDF personnel
may have about their future as well as for securing qualified
human resources, the MOD conducts support measures such as
occupational training useful for their re-employment.
In addition, as the MOD does not have the authority to provide
them with employment placement, the Foundation for the SDF
Personnel Support Association provides free job consultation
services for retired SDF personnel with permission from the
Minister of Health, Labor and Welfare and the Minister of Land,
Infrastructure, Transport and Tourism.

-----

Meanwhile, with regard to the re-employment of SDF
personnel, new regulations about re-employment were introduced
in October 2015, replacing the former prior approval system.
As are the cases in other national government employees, the
following three regulations were put in place in order to ensure
the trust of the public regarding the fairness of official duties: (1)
regulation on requesting re-employment of other personnel and
retired personnel and requesting information; (2) regulation on
seeking employment opportunities at companies in which retired
personnel had a stake whilst in office; and (3) regulation on reemployed personnel making requests.[11]In order to ensure strict
observation of these regulations, bodies comprised of academic
experts with no history serving as SDF members (Defense
Personnel Review Board’s Separate Meeting for Monitoring
Reemployment and Cabinet Office’s Re-employment Surveillance
Commission) monitor the situation, and any violation will be
met with penalties. Additionally, for the purpose of appropriate
implementation of unified management and disclosure of reemployment information by institutionalizing notification and
announcement of such information by the Cabinet, it has been
decided that information on the re-employment status of retired
SDF personnel who were in managerial positions (equivalent
to the position of Senior Coordinator in the MOD or higher) is
to be published every fiscal year by the Cabinet. In response to
the introduction of this system in FY2015, notifications of reemployment of the retired SDF personnel who were in managerial
positions submitted during FY2018 were compiled, and a total of
231 cases were officially announced in September 2019.

**4 Initiatives to Support Families**


SDF personnel (family support centers), a website for the families
of the dispatched SDF personnel and similar facilities have been
established to provide consolation for the various questions and
concerns raised by the families.

**5 Initiatives to Maintain Strong Discipline**


The MOD/SDF has gained great expectations from the
public and in order for the SDF to perform its maximum
ability on duty, it is essential to achieve support and trust
from the public. To this end, the SDF is required to always
maintain strong discipline.
The MOD/SDF has so far strived to foster well-disciplined
personnel by impressing in them an awareness of compliance
with the law through setting up such campaign periods as
the “MOD Anti-Drug Abuse Month,” “Self-Defense Forces
Personnel Ethics Week,” and “Self-Defense Personnel
Harassment Prevention Week” and implemented various
measures such as thorough instructions on service discipline.
Since 2019 the MOD/SDF has been working to prevent
harassment by such means as mandatory education on
harassment prevention for newly appointed directors of the
ministry and other executives.
In addition, under the leadership of Minister of Defense
Kono, in order to eradicate disciplinary violations such as
assault, injury and power harassment, the standards for
disciplinary action have been tightened since March 2020.

**6** Initiatives to Prevent Suicide among SDF Personnel


**Chapter**


SDF personnel suicides reached a record 101 in FY2005,
and have subsequently increased and decreased, with 59
suicides in FY2019. The suicide of SDF members is truly
a great tragedy for both the individuals themselves and
their bereaved families. It also represents a great loss to
the MOD/SDF in terms of the loss of capable personnel,
and the MOD/SDF is taking ongoing measures to prevent
suicides, including the following initiatives: (1) Expansion
and enhancement of the counseling system (internal/
external counselors, a 24-hour telephone counseling hotline,
assignment of clinical psychotherapists at camps and bases,
etc.); (2) Strengthening of education to raise awareness about
mental health for commanders as well as enlisted personnel;
and (3) Establishment of a campaign period for enhancing
mental health care, close monitoring by commanders of the
mental health condition of their subordinates whose working
environment has been changed due to personnel transfers, etc.,
and distribution of various reference materials. In 2019 the


In addition to exchanges between units and personnel’s families,
as well as between the families, the MOD in cooperation with
relevant external groups and organizations is also actively
working to develop a family support system to be implemented in
the event of large-scale natural disasters and other events, which
will include receiving cooperation in confirming the safety of the
family members of SDF personnel. All of these are conducted
as routine initiatives. The MTDP also includes promotion of
various family support measures in order to ensure a sustainable
response posture for a long period of time. Specific welfare
services for SDF personnel deployed overseas include facilitating
direct communication with their families in Japan by means such
as e-mail and video conference systems. Support for sending
comfort items from their families at a later date is also provided.
Moreover, briefing sessions for families of the dispatched SDF
personnel are held to provide them with a variety of information,
and a consultation desk exclusively for families of the dispatched

MOD/SDF promoted measures including the establishment
of a counseling service by lawyers experienced in harassment
cases in order to further improve the effectiveness of suicide
prevention measures.

**7 Commemorating Personnel who Perished in the**
Line of Duty


Since the establishment of the National Police Reserve
in 1950 and through its evolution via the National Safety
Force and the Coastal Safety Force into the SDF today, SDF
personnel have been striving to accomplish the noble mission
of protecting the peace and independence of Japan. They
have been devoting themselves unstintingly to training, day
and night, to live up to the expectations and trust of Japanese
citizens, regardless of danger, and with a strong sense of
responsibility. During this time period, however, more than
1,900 personnel have lost their lives in the line of duty.
In the MOD/SDF, funeral ceremonies in order to
express condolences are carried out by each unit to which
the personnel who perished in the line of duty belonged.
Moreover, in order to eternally recognize the achievements
of the SDF personnel who perished in the line of duty, and to

express deep honor and condolences, memorial ceremonies
are carried out in various forms, such as the Memorial
Service for members of the SDF personnel who lost their
lives in the line of duty conducted with the participation of
the Prime Minister. Achievements of 12 SDF members (4
GSDF, 4 MSDF, and 3 ASDF members, and one member of
another organization) who lost their lives in the line of duty
were recognized in a Memorial Service in FY2019.[12]


12 The Monument for SDF Personnel who Perished in the Line of Duty was constructed in 1962 in Ichigaya. In 1998, the Memorial Zone in its current form was completed by combining this
monument with other monuments located in the same area. The MOD holds an annual memorial ceremony for SDF personnel who perished in the line of duty with the attendance of
surviving family members, the Prime Minister, high-ranking officials of the MOD/SDF including the Minister of Defense, former Defense Ministers, and others. At the Monument for SDF
Personnel who Perished in the Line of Duty in the Memorial Zone, there is an iron plate containing the names and other information of personnel who perished in the line of duty. When
foreign dignitaries such as Defense Ministers visit the MOD, they make offerings of flowers, expressing their respect and condolences to personnel who perished in the line of duty.

**2** **Further Promotion of Work-Life Balance and Women’s Participation**


The security environment surrounding Japan has become
increasingly severe, and both the number and the duration of
situations requiring the MOD/SDF’s response are increasing.
On the other hand, it is anticipated that a number of MOD
staff, both male and female, will face time and commuting
constraints for childcare, nursing care and other reasons due
to big changes in social structure.
Amid such challenging circumstances, ensuring
preparedness to consistently respond to various situations
requires creating an environment that enables staff to be
sound both mentally and physically, maintain high morale,
and fully demonstrate their abilities. On the basis of this
view, the MOD/SDF promotes initiatives to achieve worklife balance of its staff members.
Also, the MOD/SDF has been proactively encouraging

**❶ [Working Style Reform]**


the active participation of female personnel, and the number
of female personnel is on the rise.
The MOD/SDF has been conducting a variety of
initiatives in order to promote work-life balance and the
further expansion of the recruitment and promotion of female
personnel in a unifi ed manner, such as formulating various
plans[1] that include three reforms: (1) working style reform;
(2) reform to combine a successful career with childrearing
and nursing care; and (3) reform for promoting active
engagement of female personnel. In addition, the Committee
to Promote Working Style Reform of the Internal Bureau
Staff has been discussing and implementing initiatives to
promote working style reform and reviewing the process of
work under the leadership of the Parliamentary Vice-Minister
of Defense.

- 

etc. The Minister of Defense and the State Minister of
Defense honored particularly excellent initiatives, out of
the applications received from various organizations and
others, and used them to help achieve work reform at
each workplace.
(3) Flexible Working Hours and Location
Realizing more flexible working hours and work
locations is necessary in light of factors such as workload
fluctuations and time constraints faced by individuals.

For this reason, the MOD/SDF introduced the flextime
system in 2016 and enabled its staff to choose Flexible
Working Hours by dividing early/late shifts into multiple
stages. In addition, telework, a work style that allows
working at home, has started in the Internal Bureau of


**Chapter**


(1) Value and Mentality Reform
In order to implement working style reform, focus needs to
be placed especially on reforming the values and mentality of
staff in managerial positions regarding working style. Since
FY2017, the MOD/SDF has been implementing educational
initiatives, such as message given by the MOD/SDF leaders,
seminars, and lecture meetings aimed at raising awareness
concerning working style reform and the concept of worklife balance. With the increase of personnel facing time/
commuting constraints for child/family care, the MOD/
SDF is also promoting correction of long working hours and
encouraging taking leave to ensure proper work-life balance
so that every member can exert his/her full potential.

(2) Work Reform in the Workplace
It is important that initiatives for the promotion of
work-life balance are implemented in a way which
fits the individual workplaces, and that staff members
themselves consider specific measures for improving
their workplace environment. This approach will lead to
developing effective initiatives and workplace climate.
Based on this perspective, since 2016, the annual
“Competition for initiatives to promote Working Style
Reform at the Ministry of Defense” has been held during
the campaign period for enhancing work-life balance,

(2) Ensuring Childcare Services
To allow SDF personnel who are rearing children to concentrate on their duties, it is important to ensure childcare services tailored to the irregular working patterns


unique to the SDF. Since April 2007, the MOD/SDF
has set up workplace nurseries at GSDF Camp Mishuku, GSDF Camp Kumamoto, GSDF Camp Makomanai,
GSDF Asaka Camp housing district, MSDF Yokosuka
Naval Base district, ASDF Iruma Air Base, Ichigaya district, where the MOD is located, and National Defense

In addition, in the event of emergency operations
such as disaster relief, the MOD promotes measures to
provide temporary childcare in SDF camps and bases for
children of SDF personnel who have no alternative but to
attend to duties with their children.

percentage points, indicating that the ratio of female SDF
personnel has been on the rise in recent years.
In order to increase the proportion of female SDF
personnel among total SDF personnel to over 9% by FY2027,
the MOD/SDF aims to ensure that women account for more
than 10% of total newly employed SDF personnel in and
after FY2017. Specifically, in order to increase the number
of recruits through such measures as the elimination of the
gender quota and the increase in the scheduled number
of female recruits, the SDF will actively recruit women,
promote their active participation, and improve education,
living, and work environments for female SDF personnel.

In addition, with regard to promotion, MDO/SDF aims to

increase the proportion of women among SDF personnel with

a rank of field officer or higher to over 3.1%. As for the careers

of the personnel anticipated to reach a rank of field officer or

higher, emphasis is given on assigning them to a commander

or assistant commander post at the rank of company officer,

with the hope of allowing them to gain experience.


**Chapter**


Captain Otani was appointed as the first female commanding officer of an Aegis destroyer
(December 2019)

reflecting values of the nation. For this reason, the
MOD/SDF has decided to open up a path for female
personnel with motivation, ability, and aptitude to have
opportunities to demonstrate their abilities in various
fields, and aim for doubling the ratio of female SDF
personnel.
In terms of employing and promoting female
SDF personnel, the MOD/SDF sets out a personnel
management policy to ensure equal opportunity between
men and women and assign the right person to the right
place based on the person’s motivation and ability/
aptitude. In December 2019, a woman assumed the role
of commanding officer of an Aegis destroyer for the
first time, promoting active participation of female SDF
personnel.

(2) Removal of the Assignment Restriction of Female SDF Personnel
The MOD/SDF has been reviewing the restriction of
assignment of female personnel. With the removal of
the restriction on female assignments in submarines in
December 2018, assignment restriction against females was
completely removed with the exception of the units where
female personnel cannot be assigned for reasons of maternity
protection (a part of the GSDF Nuclear Biological Chemical
(NBC) Weapon Defense Unit [chemical] and Tunnel
Company Units).
With the removal of the restriction on female assignments,
in 2018, the first female fighter pilot appeared. Training of
female submarine personnel was started in January 2020.
Furthermore, in March 2020, a female SDF personnel
completed a basic parachute training course of the Airborne
Training Unit and was assigned to the GSDF 1st Airborne
Brigade.


See


Fig. IV-1-2-1 (Changes in Incumbent Female SDF Personnel)


b. Female Administrative Officials, Technical and Engineering
Officials, Instructors, and Others
As of the end of March 2020, the number of female civilian
personnel—administrative officials, technical and engineering
officials, and instructors, and others—is approximately 3,400
(about 25.2% of total civilian personnel). Compared with ten
years ago (end of March 2010 when females made up 23%
of the total civilian personnel), this is a rise of 2.2 percentage
points, indicating that the ratio of female civilian personnel
is on a rising trend in recent years.
With regard to recruitment, in line with the overall
government target, the MOD has set up its goal of ensuring
that women account for over 30% of recruits in and after
FY2016. Regarding promotion, as a goal to be achieved by
the end of FY2020, the proportion of women of the DivisionDirector level at local organizations and Assistant-DivisionDirector level at the ministry proper or equivalent would
be approximately 5%, and the proportion of women of the
Division-Director level at the ministry proper or equivalent
would be approximately 2%, and the proportion of women
of the Unit-Chief level at the ministry proper or equivalent
should be approximately 27%.

**Measures on Defense Equipment**
**and Technology**
###### 2


Military technologies in recent years are showing remarkable
advances. Against the backdrop of such technological
advances, contemporary warfare increasingly features
capabilities combined across all domains: not only land, sea
and air but also new domains, which are space, cyberspace
and electromagnetic spectrum. Aiming to improve overall
military capability, states are seeking to gain superiority in
technologies that undergird capabilities in these new domains.
They endeavor to develop weapons that leverage cutting-edge,
potentially game-changing technologies. They also engage in
research of autonomous unmanned weapon systems equipped
with artifi cial intelligence (AI). Further technological
innovations in quantum technology including quantum
computing and quantum cryptography and the information
and communication technology (ICT) sector including the 5th
generation mobile communication system (5G) will make it


even more diffi cult to forecast future warfare.
While Japan is facing severe fi nancial conditions, imports
of foreign equipment are increasing due to their highperformance and the complex trends of defense equipment.
On the other hand, Japan’s defense industry has been exposed
to harsh conditions due to a downward trend in the number
of procured equipment from domestic companies and other
reasons.
Amid such a situation, it is essential to work on (1)
reviewing equipment structure, (2) reinforcing technology
base, (3) optimizing equipment procurement, (4) strengthening
defense industrial base, and (5) promoting defense equipment
and technology cooperation in order to ensure a necessary
and suffi cient defense capability in terms of both quality and
quantity for the construction of a Multi-domain Defense Force.

this effort.


3 Suspending Operation of Equipment of Lowered
Priority

The MTDP plans to reduce the number of aircraft types,
suspend the use of equipment of lowered priority, and review
or terminate projects of low cost-effectiveness.
Specifi cally, 203mm self-propelled howitzer and other
equipment whose priority is low in light of the security
environment surrounding Japan will not be replaced.
Biological Reconnaissance Vehicles and other equipment that
are procured in a small number with low cost effectiveness
will be decommissioned while maintaining the capabilities.

**❶ [Necessity of Reinforcing Technology Base]**

As the security environment surrounding Japan becomes
increasingly severe, it is necessary to ensure technological
superiority by effectively utilizing Japan’s advanced
technological strength in order to protect the lives and
property of Japanese people in any situation. Particularly
in recent years, with the rapid advances in technological
innovation, it is forecast that we will see the operationalization
of so-called game-changing technology that will completely
transform combat aspects in the future, and the United States
and other countries are proceeding hastily with research and
development.

See Part I, Chapter 3, Section 1 (Trends Concerning Military

See

Science and Technology)


strengthening of the technology base is a pressing issue.
The state-of-the-art military technologies in each country
are sensitive technologies that must not be easily shared
with other countries. From the perspective of Japan, for the
areas which should strategically maintain their domestic
technology base, it is necessary to promote research and
development domestically. In the cases of defense equipment
and technology cooperation, such as equipment procurement
and international joint development, it is important to
maintain the leading role by owning important cutting-edge
technology (key technology). This requires not only research
and development by the MOD, but also the promotion of
research and development by both the public and private
sectors together.

**1 Outline of Defense Technology Strategy**


**2 Medium- to Long-Term Defense Technology Outlook**


The Medium- to Long-Term Defense Technology Outlook
presents an outlook of the technologies that can be applied to
equipment expected to be established in roughly the next 20
years, and indicates technology fields that need to be developed
in order to ensure Japan’s technological superiority. It is expected
that making this Outlook public will facilitate the integration of
superior civilian advanced technologies and the development of
technologies outside of the MOD aimed at defense equipment
applications. Review is now underway for taking a more strategic
approach to important technologies, including technologies
pertaining to new domains and other potentially game-changing
technologies such as AI.

**3 “Research and Development (R&D)Vision”**


(1) MOD Technology Policy Objectives

The following two objectives of the MOD technology policy are

designed to strengthen the technical capabilities, which serve

as the foundation of Japan’s defense capabilities, to make the

foundation more robust:

(i) Ensuring technical superiority

(ii) Delivering superior defense equipment through effective  and

efficient research and development

(2) Specific Measures to be Promoted

The following three measures are promoted to achieve the
objectives indicated in the previous paragraph.
(i) Grasping Technological Information
With regard to various scientific technologies that support defense
technologies, the MOD grasps the current situation and trends
both in and outside of Japan, including dual-use technology[2] in the
public and private sectors and cutting-edge scientific technology.
In addition, the MOD develops and publishes the Medium- to
Long-Term Defense Technology Outlook (see Paragraph 2
below) to identify advanced technology fields, which have the
potential to become game changers.
(ii) Development of Technologies
The MOD will promote research and development based on the
“Research and Development Vision” (see Paragraph 3 below)
that was formulated to promote medium- to long-term research
and development. At the same time, the MOD also promotes
research and development that serve as the foundation of defense
force building and “Innovative Science & Technology Initiative
for Security,” which puts into perspective the identification and
development of advanced technology expected to be used for
technology exchange with relevant domestic/overseas agencies
and for defense purposes, and technical research for application
of the results to equipment, etc.
(iii) Protection of Technologies
The MOD implements technology control for proper technology
transfer to prevent situations in which Japan’s technology leaks
without the country’s intention, which would undermine the
maintenance of peace and security in the international community
or the ensuring of Japan’s technological superiority. The MOD
also establishes intellectual property management taking into
account the transfer of defense equipment and promotes the
utilization of intellectual property.

**Chapter**


The “Research and Development (R&D) Vision” presents
principles on R&D, technological challenges, and roadmaps
on R&D of the technologies required for our future defense
capability for the purpose of conducting advanced R&D
systematically from a mid-to-long term viewpoint.
The MOD publishes R&D Vision, and shares them with
the defense industry, with the aim of increasing predictability
for relevant companies, promoting prior investment,
and realizing more effective and efficient research and
development by maximally exploiting the investment. So far,
the MOD published the “R&D Vision on the Future Fighter
Aircraft” in 2010 and the “R&D Vision on Future Unmanned
Equipment: Focusing on Unmanned Aerial Vehicle” in 2016.
In August 2019, the MOD published the “Research and
Development (R&D) Vision—Toward Realization of MultiDomain Defense Force and Beyond” in order to contribute
to the realization of Multi-Domain Defense Force and to
achieve technological innovation necessary for further
strengthening defense capability. The MOD will continue to
promote research and development according to the roadmap
of the R&D Vision while reviewing the R&D Vision, as
well as establishing and publishing visions on new themes
considering the direction of policy, operational needs,
changes in technological trends and others.


-----

**❸ [Initiatives for Research and Development]**

Technological progress is about to fundamentally change
how security should be managed, and major states
endeavor to develop weapons that leverage cutting-edge
technologies. Against this backdrop, the MOD is promoting
focused research in promising technical fi elds in order to
ensure technological superiority in strategically important
equipment and technology fi elds through focused investment
in technologies in new domains, potentially game-changing
cutting-edge technologies such as AI, and other important
technologies. Specifi cally, for R&D of AI, the MOD included
in the FY2020 budget the expense for research on radio
image identifi cation technology using AI. The MOD also
has been making efforts to greatly shorten the research and
development periods of Hyper Velocity Gliding Projectile
Intended for the Defense of Remote Islands, UUVs for longterm operation, standoff electronic warfare aircraft and other
equipment through fl exible and active use of new methods for
stage-by-stage R&D of equipment, such as block approach
and modularization. Research projects on new technologies,
including UAVs and lasers, will include demonstrations
that enable users to imagine how these technologies will
be used. For equipment which is expected to need mediumterm development, the ministry will develop a concrete
image of future equipment by collecting and fully analyzing
information on their technical feasibility from private
companies and other parties at an early stage. Furthermore,
the MOD effi ciently and effectively conducts research on
UUVs, etc. using dual-use technologies based on the “Basic
Policy on the Relocation of Governmental Organizations”[3]

along with developing a new test and evaluation facility
“Iwakuni Test Evaluation Facility (provisional name)”
in Iwakuni City. The facility is also available for use by
the civilian sector, including local institutions for higher
education and research institutes.
In addition, based on the MTDP, the MOD is working to
actively leverage potentially dual-use advanced commercial
technologies through such efforts as technology exchange

with relevant domestic and overseas entities, enhanced
collaboration with relevant ministries and agencies, and use of
the “Innovative Science & Technology Initiative for Security”
program. In this regard, the MOD/SDF will strengthen and
expand cooperation with countries who are making largescale investments in game-changing technologies, such
as the U.S. and special strategic partner countries, and
promote mutually complementary international joint R&D.
The MOD/SDF is also conducting studies to reinforce its
structure aimed at early discovery of innovative, emerging
technologies and fostering thereof by utilizing and creating
think tanks that survey and analyze the latest foreign and
domestic technological trends.
For F-X to succeed the F-2 fi ghter aircraft, a development
project starts in FY2020, and “F-X Development Division”
was established in the Acquisition, Technology and Logistics
Agency (ATLA) in order to ensure effi cient development.
Furthermore, for improving technical reliability and
reducing the development cost, the MOD is pursuing the best
approach to realize Japan led development with international
cooperation in sight.

**Chapter**


Column Development of F-X

The Japan-led development of F-X to succeed the ASDF’s F-2
fi ghter is scheduled to start in FY2020.
Over the years, Japan has built a fi ghter force structure comprising multiple types of fi ghter aircraft, as the MOD believes
that deploying three types of fi ghter aircraft equipped with different combat systems makes it possible to effectively acquire
and maintain air superiority. The MOD believes that it is necessary to ensure this structure into the future to acquire and
maintain air superiority. While the F-2 is an important fi ghter
that supports this fi ghter force structure, it is scheduled to start F-X (Conceptual image)
retiring around 2035. In order to maintain the structure by introducing the successor aircraft by that time, it is necessary to start
developing F-X to succeed the F-2 now. tems, administrative work related to budget implementation,

At the same time, in order to create excellent defense
equipment through the utilization of advanced technologies
and effectively and effi ciently conduct R&D, the MOD
will ensure cross-sectoral and substantial coordination
at the Council for Science, Technology and Innovation
(CSTI)[4] and other control tower meetings[5] based on the

exchange with research institutes, etc. in order to understand
trends of civilian technologies for complementary and
synergistic improvement of technological capabilities.
As international cooperative activities, the MOD will
continue Japan-U.S. joint research and engineer exchanges,
and continuously consider diverse possibilities through
continued opinion exchange with other countries at various
opportunities while closely observing their technology
strategies, etc.

**2 Innovative Science & Technology Initiative for**
Security and Its Utilization


At the Sensor Expo Japan 2019, exhibited the outcomes of the research utilizing the
Innovative Science & Technology Initiative for Security (September 2019) **Chapter**
**2**

Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA)
of the United States facilitated advances in science and
technology as a whole including civilian technology, such
as the development of the Internet and GPS. From this
perspective, the MOD intends to promote relevant measures
and strives to raise awareness of this program that contributes
to ensuring the freedom of study and its sound development.


In FY2015, the MOD launched a competitive research
funding program called “Innovative Science & Technology
Initiative for Security” to publicly seek and commission
basic research on advanced civilian technologies, which are
expected to contribute to future research and development in
defense areas. A total of 74 research projects were awarded[7]
by FY2019, and this program was expanded in FY2017 in
order to enable the awarding of larger-scale and longer-term
research projects. The program will continue to run on a
similar scale in FY2020 (total budget of about 9.5 billion
yen).
In the basic research areas, free thinking of researchers
leads to innovative and creative results. For this reason, it is
necessary to assign maximum value to freedom of research
when sponsoring research, so that, for example, researchers
will be able to publish all of their research results to have a
wide range of academic discussions. Hence, in this program,
the MOD will neither restrict contractors’ publication of
research results, nor designate research results as confidential,
never providing any confidential data to researchers. In
actuality, some research results have already been published
through oral presentations, publications, etc.
Active utilization of advanced civilian technology through
such programs is not only essential for securing the lives and
peaceful livelihood of the Japanese people into the future,
but is also beneficial for the development of Japan’s science,
technology and innovation in non-defense areas as well,
similar to how investment in innovative technology by the

from the previous fi scal year, and thus reviews Acquisition
Strategy. In August 2019, Analysis and Evaluation of the
acquisition programs were implemented for 19 items for
which the Acquisition Strategy, etc. had been developed.

See  Fig. IV-2-3-1 (Equipment for Project Management and

See

Equipment for Semi-Project Management)


**1 Acquisition of Defense Equipment through Focused**
Project Management

As defense equipment is becoming more sophisticated and
complex, its entire life cycle (concept study, research and
development, mass production, deployment, operation and
maintenance) cost has a tendency to increase in recent years.
It has become extremely important to streamline acquisition
throughout the life cycle of equipment and to establish
a systematic management to realize the streamlining in
order to effi ciently acquire equipment of assured quality at
appropriate cost in a required timeline as planned.
Therefore, since the establishment of ATLA in October
2015, the Department of Project Management in ATLA
undertakes project management throughout the life cycle of
equipment upon selecting important equipment, and promotes
efforts to realize the optimized equipment acquisition.
Specifi cally, the MOD has selected 18 items for major
programs designated for project management and 6 items
for semi-major programs for project management[1] as of the
end of March 2020. The MOD designated Project Managers
(PMs) dedicated to specifi c major programs. At the same
time, the MOD established a systematic project management
system by setting up the Integrated Project Team (IPT),
which is composed of offi cials from relevant divisions within

the MOD.
So far (as of the end of March 2020), for 23 items that have
been selected for major and semi-major programs, the MOD
has formulated the Acquisition Strategy and the Acquisition
Plan (hereinafter referred to as “Acquisition Strategy, etc.”),
which specify the basic matters necessary to systematically
implement project management, such as the purpose of the
acquisition program, acquisition policy, and life cycle cost.
The Acquisition Strategy, etc. shows strategic plans to realize
optimized acquisitions of equipment.
Furthermore, in principle, ATLA annually confi rms the
project implementation status with each SDF service, and
endeavors to promote appropriate project management
refl ecting the latest situation by developing Analysis and
Evaluation, which compile changes made in acquisition plans


**Chapter**


**2 Initiatives to Promote and Strengthen Project**
Management

(1) Past Initiatives
The following initiatives have been implemented to promote
and strengthen project management.
a. Cost and Schedule Management Using WBS
For certain kinds of equipment produced in Japan, the MOD
promotes the introduction of a management method to visualize
the progress of work and cost generated by component (Work
Breakdown Structure [WBS])[2] and endeavors to manage cost
and schedule to detect the signs of cost increase and schedule
delay early so that swift measures can be taken.
b. Method for More Accurate Cost Estimate
Life cycle cost and other costs have been estimated based on
actual cost data of similar equipment developed or introduced in
the past. However, as a larger amount of cost data is needed for
a more accurate estimate, the MOD promotes the establishment

of a cost database by collecting cost data and accumulating them
into a database.

c. Accumulation and Development of Expertise through Strengthened

Cooperation with Research and Educational Institutions, etc.
For further improving the management skills of PMs and
enhancing human resources among those who engage in project
management, the MOD strengthens collaboration with research
and educational institutions on project management and
provides opportunities to study project management methods
from overseas and the private sector on a regular basis.


A semi-major project is an acquisition project of specifi c equipment with a limited application of project management without the designation of PM and IPT, focusing on risks in functions,
performance, costs, schedules and other risk factors as in the case of equipment for project management.

WBS is a hierarchical structure used to practice project management that systematically divides the project into manageable units, in which the schedule and cost of each deliverable

(2) Future Initiatives
In order to further promote effective and effi cient equipment
acquisition, the MOD needs to enhance the effectiveness and
fl exibility of project management throughout equipment life
cycles. To this end, under the MTDP, the MOD/SDF will
take new initiatives, including undertakings that contribute
to cost reduction at mass production stage as a requirement

at the development stage, incorporating successful examples
in the civilian sector into the manufacture of defense
equipment, and actively adopting the competitive bidding


method and other contracting methods that contribute to the
utilization of private sector knowledge and expertise, and
tightening cost controls. In this regard, the MOD will expand
the items subject to project management and strive to adjust
the standards for the specifi cations and the review of project
plans with consideration of life cycle costs. Furthermore, for
more effi cient acquisition, during the equipment selection

phase, the MOD will implement thorough life cycle cost
estimation, and analysis of alternatives, and secure binding
obligations against company principals.


**❷ [Improving the Contract System and Other Related Matters]**


**1 Reviewing Acquisition Systems**

For the purpose of promoting acquisition reform, which is a

prompt response to swiftly changing surroundings, the MOD has

been holding meetings of the Comprehensive Acquisition Reform

Committee since 2007, in addition to the Contractual Systems

Study Groups held since 2010 to review acquisition systems.

Since FY2016, a special research offi cer system[3] has been adopted

in order to surely bring the review results to fruition.


**2 Long-Term Contracts, etc.**

The production of defense equipment requires a signifi cant

amount of time. Therefore, if a certain amount is to be

procured in bulk, a contract for more than fi ve years is

needed in many cases. With regard to defense equipment and

services, economies of scale[4] tend not to work mainly due

to the following reasons: (1) the MOD is the only customer;

and (2) companies that provide such defense equipment,


This is a system to conduct research, which contributes to the acquisition system of defense equipment, by inviting experts, such as associate professors from different universities
specializing in the areas of concern, in order to review and reconsider an effective procurement system, based not only on the viewpoints of the MOD personnel but also on theories that
have been proposed in the fi eld of business administration and economics.

etc., are limited. In addition, it is difficult for companies to

systematically move forward with their businesses with a

high degree of predictability, which is peculiar to the defense

industry.
For these reasons, the upper limit of acts that incur
national debt prescribed in the Public Finance Act as within
five years in principle was changed to within ten years for
specific equipment through the enactment of the Long-term
Contract Act.[5] The introduction of this change regarding
long-term contracts will make stable procurement possible,
leading to the realization of the systematic improvement of
defense capability. At the same time, for companies, given
that the procurement amount will be assured, the systematic
use of personnel and equipment, as well as cost reductions
due to bulk orders, will be made possible.


Total of approx. 25.4 billion yen

In addition, regarding procurement of certain equipment
with which little competitiveness can be expected due to its
characteristics, and companies that work on cost reduction
using the MOD’s programs, the MOD promotes limited
tendering contracts while ensuring transparency and fairness
as well as clarifying and putting the subject into patterns,
from the perspective of the implementation of smooth and
efficient procurement, and the enhancement of the company’s
predictability.
Specifically, as a new initiative, in acquiring new
destroyers,[7]the MOD has adopted a procurement method
to acquire the new destroyers efficiently equipped with
the necessary functions and to maintain and strengthen the
construction technology base since February 2017. This is
done by selecting a party that has made the best proposal
with respect to the MOD’s requirements as a procurement
counterparty, with the runner-up also involved in designing
and building facilities as a subcontractor. The MOD
concluded a proposal agreement in April 2017 and decided
on a procurement counterparty and a subcontractor in August
2017.


See


Fig. IV-2-3-2 (Image of Long-term Contracts and the Cost
Reduction Effect)
Part II, Chapter 4, Section 2-3 (Initiatives for Increasing the
Efficiency of Procurement)


In addition, by realizing longer-term multiple-year
contracts utilizing the Private Finance Initiative (PFI) Act,[6]
the planned acquisition and execution of budgets is achieved
through the standardization of investment amounts of the
national expenditure, and certain benefits are obtained, such
as cutting equipment procurement costs, by reducing risks
for those taking orders and by promoting the entry of new
suppliers. As projects using the PFI Act, the MOD launched


“Special Measures Law Concerning the Term of Expenditure Based on the Obligatory Assurance of National Subsidization for Specific Defense Procurement” (enacted in April 2015. An act
for its partial revision to extend the effective period by five years was enacted in March 2019.)

an incentive contract system in which the public and
private sectors jointly carry out the management of contract
implementation to minimize contractual risks, and in which a

Since April 2020, a system to give an incentive for cost
reduction has been in operation in order to fairly evaluate
cost reduction efforts by companies.

With regard to periodic maintenance of defense equipment,
the MOD has been working to improve efficiency by
extending the maintenance interval, after making sufficient
efforts to ensure safety. In addition, the MOD has been
working on the introduction of Performance Based Logistics
(PBL)[8] from the perspective of improving the equipment
availability ratio and long-term cost reductions. In the
FY2020 budget, the MOD pursues cost reduction and stable
procurement through long-term contracts regarding repair of
a certain quantity of fighter aircraft (F-15) components.


**3 Efforts to Increase Fairness and Transparency**

The MOD implements measures for making contracts more
appropriate and strengthening checking functions to promote
the enhancement of fairness and transparency in relation to the
acquisition of equipment and materials.
As a part of the effort to “make public procurement more
appropriate” across the whole government, the MOD continues
to carry out the introduction and expansion of a comprehensive
evaluation bidding system[9] and make bidding procedures
more efficient. In addition to these, based on reflection on the
past, strengthening system investigation, reviewing penalties,
ensuring the effectiveness of supervision and inspection,
and other measures have steadily been carried out in order
to prevent recurrence of such incidents as overcharging and
falsified results of equipment testing by defense-related

companies in 2012. Through these measures, the MOD strives
to surely prevent recurrence of scandals, enhance fairness and
transparency, and make contracts more appropriate.
In addition, ATLA carries out multilayered checks through
both internal and external checking systems and check-andbalance within the organization – namely, ATLA further enhances
internal inspections by the inspection and audit department, and
through deliberations in the Defense Procurement Council,
consisting of external experts, and defense inspection conducted
by the Inspector General’s Office of Legal Complaints. Moreover,
ATLA has also improved its education department and strives to
enhance compliance awareness by providing thorough education
pertaining to compliance for ATLA personnel.

**2 Achieving Further Efficiency in the Acquisition of**
Defense Equipment

When acquiring defense equipment, the MOD aims to
reduce development, acquisition, and maintenance expenses
through the development of product families, standardization
of equipment specifications, joint procurement of equipment
common to multiple SDF services, etc., in addition to a
review of the contract system. In the FY2020 budget, cost
reduction is expected by the development of a multipurpose
surveillance radar that combines the four types of radar
owned by the GSDF.
In addition, the MOD has been facilitating the compilation
of a database on the breakdown of procurement prices and
actual price of major equipment in the past. The MOD expects
this database to be utilized not only to verify the validity of
procurement prices, but also to enhance the accuracy and


PBL is a contract method that involves payment of compensation according to the level of equipment performance achieved in terms of availability ratio and stable stock. It has achieved
positive outcomes upon application to the maintenance and servicing of equipment in Western countries.

**Strengthening Defense Industrial Base**

**4**


Strong industrial base is essential for ensuring the production
and a high operation rate of high-performance equipment.
For this purpose, the MOD established the Strategy on
Defense Production and Technological Bases in June 2014 to
maintain and strengthen the base. Based on the NDPG[1], etc.,


the ministry will make efforts towards making the defense
industrial base more resilient, so that it can effectively
respond to changing security environment. For example,
since 2019, the MOD has arranged meetings to exchange
views with the industry.

Bases on Transfer of Defense Equipment and Technology.


**Chapter**


**(1) Signifi cance of Formulation of the Strategy on Defense**
**Production and Technological Bases**

“The Strategy on Defense Production and Technological
Bases” has made the following three points clear: (1)
the context of the formulation of the strategy on defense
production and technological bases and where this strategy
stands; (2) characteristics of defense production and
technological bases; and (3) changes in the environment
surrounding defense production and technological bases.

**(2) Goals and Signifi cance of Maintaining and Strengthening**
**Defense Production and Technological Bases**

Through maintaining and strengthening defense production
and technological bases, the MOD intends to (1) ensure
sovereignty of security, (2) potentially contribute to
increasing deterrence capability, and maintain and improve
bargaining power, and (3) contribute to the sophistication
of the domestic industry in Japan driven by cutting-edge
technology.


**(5) Measures for Maintaining and Strengthening Defense**
**Production and Technological Bases**

In order to maintain and strengthen defense production and
technological bases, the MOD will promote the following
measures with a focus on variation and effi ciency, while
considering Japan’s severe fi scal condition: (1) improvement
in the contract system; (2) initiatives in research and
development; (3) promotion of defense equipment and
technology cooperation; (4) initiatives for defense industrial
organizations including the building of robust production and
technological bases through understanding actual situations
of the supply chain; (5) strengthening of the MOD’s
functions through the establishment of ATLA,[5] etc.; and (6)
collaboration with other relevant ministries and government
agencies.

**(6) Current Situation and Courses of Action for Each Defense**
**Equipment Sector**

With regard to the main defense equipment sectors (such as
land equipment, supplies, etc., ships, aircraft, explosives,
guided weapons, communications electronics and command
control systems, unmanned equipment, space and cyber
systems), the MOD will analyze the current situation of
defense production and technological bases. At the same


(3) Basic Viewpoints for Promoting Measures
For the promotion of measures, the MOD takes into account
the following basic viewpoints: (1) establishing long-term
partnership between the private and public sectors; (2)

time, based on the priority matters for developing the SDF s
structure indicated in the 2013 NDPG, the MOD will present
the future direction of the maintenance and strengthening


of defense production and technological bases and the
acquisition plan for each defense equipment sectors, and
thereby, seek to increase predictability for companies.


**❸ [Initiatives toward Strengthening of Defense Industrial Base]**


and cost reduction, as well as giving appropriate incentives
based on the evaluation result.

**(2) Strengthening Risk Management of Supply Chain for**
**Defense Equipment**

The procurement of defense equipment involves not only
prime companies that directly contract with the MOD but
also supplier companies in a broad range of fields and sizes,
which contract with the prime companies. The chains of these
companies (supply chains) are the basis of Japan’s defense
industry. However, these supply chains are confronted
with risks, such as supply disruption due to withdrawing or
bankruptcy of some manufacturing companies. In order to
deal with the risks, the MOD is taking measures in order to
maintain and strengthen the supply chains.
Past supply chain surveys revealed the presence of
Small and Medium-sized Enterprises (SMEs) that have
a high dependency rate on defense equipment. In the
supply chain survey conducted by the end of FY2019[6], key
suppliers holding irreplaceable technologies were identified.
Additionally, vulnerabilities became apparent, such as a
concentration of orders to a certain supplier.
Based on the survey results, the MOD will create a
database of the results of the supply chain survey, and
build a regular monitoring system for early identification
of risks, such as supply disruption. Furthermore, the MOD
will accurately deal with the vulnerabilities in the supply
chain and strengthen the chain through initiatives such as
identification of SMEs that have excellent technologies/
products, advancement of the technology base in order
to manage supply disruption and other risks, a study of
measures to support enterprises regarding transfer of
business and evaluation of the possibility of application of
innovative technologies represented by 3D printer and AI to
defense equipment.

**(3) Further Industrial Participation of Japan’s Defense**
**Industry in Sustainment and Maintenance of Imported**
**Equipment, etc.**

Industrial participation in the sustainment and maintenance
business of imported equipment is productive for the
strengthening of Japan’s industrial base. For this purpose,
it is important to pursue participation in the sustainment


**1 Past Initiatives**


Based on the Strategy on Defense Production and
Technological Bases, the MOD has implemented various
measures contributing to the maintenance and strengthening
of the defense industrial base, such as improving the contract
system, including the enactment of the Long-term Contract
Act, and the establishment of ATLA, which integrated
the organizations involved in the defense equipment
procurement.
In addition, the following new measures are also taken in
ATLA: (1) formulation of Defense Technology Strategy,
etc. for ensuring the technological superiority, and
implementation of the “Innovative Science & Technology
Initiative for Security” (see Section 2); (2) formulation
of the Acquisition Strategic Plan for promoting project
management, and improvement of contract systems (see
Section 3); (3) grasping the supply chain in the defense
industry and responses to risks in order to maintain and
strengthen the defense industrial base (see Paragraph 2
below); and (4) participation of Japanese companies in
the international F-35 program and defense equipment
and technology cooperation involving joint research and
development with other countries (see Section 5).

**2 Initiatives Based on the NDPG**


**Chapter**


In order to strengthen Japan’s defense industrial base, which
is essential to the production, operation, sustainment and
maintenance of defense equipment, the MOD will work on
the following initiatives based on the NDPG, etc., while
considering the orientation of the defense production and
technology strategy.

**(1) Reforming the Existing Contract System towards Creating**
**a Competitive Environment among Companies**

Japan’s defense industry is in a less competitive environment
as there are many defense equipment items that only one
company can produce. To address this issue, the MOD will
review the existing contract system towards creation of a
competitive environment among companies by actively
evaluating initiatives and results which contribute to
strengthening the competitiveness of the defense industry

and maintenance of F-35A, Osprey, and other imported
equipment and benefits for domestic companies through
further promotion of joint R&D of high-capability equipment
with the United States and other countries.[7]

(4) Promoting Appropriate Overseas Transfer of Defense
Equipment under the Three Principles on Transfer of
Defense Equipment and Technology

The government as a whole will work on necessary
improvement in implementation of related rules for promoting
appropriate overseas transfer of defense equipment. At the
same time, the MOD will strengthen intellectual property
management, technology control and information security
to prevent leakages of important technologies regarding

defense equipment.
a. Initiatives for Necessary Operational Improvement
The MOD, in cooperation with relevant ministries
and agencies, will work on necessary improvement in
implementation of related rules based on the Three Principles
on Transfer of Defense Equipment and Technology, which
are the operational standards for the Foreign Exchange
and Foreign Trade Act. As a result, the MOD will enhance
predictability for the defense industry and will promote
appropriate and smooth equipment transfer.
Specifically, the ministry thinks it necessary to improve
the implementation of relevant systems and procedures,
which include rationalization of the handling of basic
marketing information necessary for early business talks at
international trade shows, etc.[8] in order to ensure the smooth
provision of such information.

b. Preventing Leakage of Key Technologies
(a) Intellectual Property Management
Through the application of more appropriate contract
provisions regarding intellectual property, the MOD will
accurately grasp intellectual property generated through
R&D, etc. to promote the clarification of public or private
belongings and prevention of leakages of key technologies
to abroad. The ministry will also present options regarding
the opening or closing of intellectual properties based on the
characteristics of the technology and promotes appropriate
management for each option.

(b) Technology Control
The MOD will strengthen technology control systems
and functions for strengthening prevention measures of
technology leakage such as ensuring prompt and proper


assessment of technological sensitivity based on the
importance and superiority of the technologies, which is
needed in the examination of the propriety of overseas
transfer of defense equipment and technology. Also, in order
to prevent leakages of sensitive technologies, the MOD, in
cooperation with relevant ministries and agencies, promotes
studies on reverse engineering countermeasure technologies,
such as black box constitution.
(c) Strengthening Information Security
For Japan’s defense industry to participate in international
businesses, it is necessary to respond to increasing threats
of cyber attacks. With the aim of strengthening information
security measures, the MOD will review the information
security standard applicable to contractors handling the
MOD’s information to be protected.[9]

In order to further encourage companies to consider
entry into defense procurement business and facilitate
their business with defense-related companies in Japan and
abroad, it is important to improve the predictability of the
necessary security measures for the companies. For this
purpose, the MOD will develop an information security
guidebook that comprehensively defines security measures
that will normally be required for concluding a contract,
which involves the handling of information to be secured,

with the MOD in advance.

(5) Other Initiatives to Achieve Efficiency and Strength
Other than the above-mentioned initiatives, the MOD/SDF
will undertake measures such as making the equipment
manufacturing process efficient and thoroughly reducing
cost and will strive to make Japan’s defense industry base
efficient and resilient while foreseeing possible realignment
and consolidation of businesses that may occur as a result of
these measures.

**3 Cooperation/Collaboration with the Industry**


**Chapter**


The maintenance and strengthening of Japan’s technological
and industrial base are essential for production, operation
and maintenance of defense equipment. For the effort
of “Reinforcing Technology Base” and “Strengthening
Defense Industrial Base” that are provided in NDPG and
MTDP, cooperation between the MOD and the industry is
indispensable.
In this context, in October 2019, Defense Minister


SM-3 block IIA, jointly developed by Japan and the United States, is subject to FMS procurement, but Japanese companies have received contracts for manufacturing about half of the
components, including those procured by the United States.

In October 2018, the Q&A section of the Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry website made it clear that information on the performance of goods and other matters that is used in early
stage business talks and that does not include “specific information necessary for design, manufacture or use,” such as design information and production technique, is not subject to
regulation under the Foreign Exchange Act. At the request of companies, the MOD is currently confirming the range of information included in data created by a company that may be
disclosed to the public and handled as publicly known technology available to an unspecified large number of people.

**Section**

**Defense Equipment and Technology Cooperation**

**5**


Based on the Three Principles on Transfer of Defense
Equipment and Technology, Japan promotes cooperation
in defense equipment and technology with other countries
in order to contribute to the maintenance and strengthening
of defense technological and industrial bases, as well as
contributing to the promotion of our national security, peace


and international cooperation. Japan will continue to realize
effective defense equipment and technology cooperation
through the strengthening of intelligence gathering such as
the needs of its counterparts, cooperation including assistance
for maintenance and repair of equipment, and strengthening
of cooperative posture between the public and private sectors.


**❶ [Three Principles on Transfer of Defense Equipment and Technology]**


**Chapter**


Based on the National Security Strategy formulated in
December 2013, the Three Principles on Transfer of
Defense Equipment and Technology[1] and its implementation
guidelines were formulated in April 2014 as clear principles
adapted to the new security environment. Under the
principles, the MOD will contribute to peace and international
cooperation more than ever, while actively promoting
measures necessary for maintaining the peace and stability
of the region and fi rmly defending Japan through active
defense cooperation with the United States, which is Japan’s
ally, and other countries. An appropriate overseas transfer
of defense equipment and technology contributes to further
active promotion of the maintenance of international peace
and security. Such transfer also contributes to strengthening
security and defense cooperation with Japan’s ally, the United
States as well as other countries. Furthermore, it contributes
to maintaining and enhancing Japan’s defense production
and technological bases, thereby contributing to Japan’s
enhancement of defense capability, given that international
joint development and production projects have become the
international mainstream.

See  Reference 57 (Three Principles on Transfer of Defense
Equipment and Technology)


**(2) Limitation to Cases Where Transfers May Be Permitted**
**As Well As Strict Examination and Information Disclosure**
**(the Second Principle)**

The cases where transfers may be permitted are limited
to (1) cases that contribute to the active promotion of
peace contribution and international cooperation, (2) cases
that contribute to the security of Japan, or other cases.
The Government will conduct strict examination on the
appropriateness of the destination and end user, and on the
extent of the concerns that the overseas transfer of such
equipment and technology will raise for Japan’s security,
whilst ensuring transparency. In addition, it has been decided
that important cases would be deliberated at the National
Security Council and along with this, information concerning
the cases that were deliberated would be disclosed.

**(3) Ensuring Appropriate Control regarding Extra-Purpose**
**Use or Transfer to Third Parties (the Third Principle)**

Overseas transfers of defense equipment and technology
will be permitted only in cases where appropriate control
is ensured, and the Government will in principle oblige the
government of the recipient country to gain its prior consent
regarding extra-purpose use and transfer to third parties.
However, in cases where it is judged appropriate for the
active promotion of peace contribution and international
cooperation, cases involving participation in the international
systems for sharing parts, and cases where parts are delivered
to a licenser, appropriate control may be ensured with the
confi rmation of the control system at the destination.


1 Main Contents of the New Three Principles

**(1) Clarifi cation of Cases Where Transfers Are Prohibited (the**
**First Principle)**

The cases where overseas transfers of defense equipment
are prohibited are clarifi ed as follows: (1) in the case
of violating the obligations under treaties and other
international agreements that Japan has concluded; (2) in the
case of violating the obligations based on the Resolution of
the United Nations Security Council; or (3) in the case of
transferring to the countries in confl icts.


See  Reference 58 (The First Principle “The Cases Where Transfers
Are Prohibited,” the Second Principle “Limitation to Cases
Where Transfers May Be Permitted,” and the Third Principle
“Ensuring Appropriate Control”)


The term “defense equipment” is deemed appropriate for the title of “Three Principles for the Transfer of Defense Equipment and Technology,” since possible articles of overseas transfers
help with peace contribution and international cooperation as was seen in the example of the provision of bulldozers and other items belonging to the SDF to disaster-stricken countries.

timing informed by regional demands for repair.[7]

Establishing a maintenance depot for airframes, engines
and others within Japan, and contributing to maintenance in
the Asia-Pacific region are significant from the perspectives
of securing the operational support system for F-35A fighter
aircraft in Japan, maintaining the Japanese defense industrial
base, strengthening the Japan-U.S. Alliance, and deepening
equipment cooperation in the Asia-Pacific region.

**(2) Initiatives towards the Establishment of a Common**
**Maintenance Base of the Japan-U.S. Osprey**

As the Planned Maintenance Interval (PMI) of the U.S.
Marine Corps Ospreys deployed at Marine Corps Air Station
Futenma was scheduled to commence roughly in 2017, the
U.S. Navy carried out a public tender to select a maintenance
company. Fuji Heavy Industries Ltd.[8] was selected as the
maintenance company for this purpose in October 2015.
From February 2017, the PMI has been performed at


GSDF Camp Kisarazu. Maintenance of the first aircraft was
completed in March 2019 and the second in March 2020, and
the aircraft were delivered to the U.S. Forces.
The MOD intends to establish a common maintenance
base for both Japan’s and the United States’ Osprey by
allowing the maintenance company to use the hangar at
GSDF Camp Kisarazu for aircraft maintenance of the U.S.
Marine Corps Osprey and also to implement the future
aircraft maintenance of the GSDF Osprey at the same camp
from the following perspectives: (1) smooth introduction of
the GSDF Osprey (V-22);[9](2) smooth and effective operation
of the Japan-U.S. security arrangements; and (3) enhanced
efficiency in maintenance. The establishment of a common
maintenance base at GSDF Camp Kisarazu would be
extremely significant in that it will contribute to mitigating
the burden on Okinawa as well as the “Strengthening of the
basis to repair and maintain common equipment” stated in
the new Guidelines.

Working Group on Defence Equipment and Technology
Cooperation have been held five times so far. At the JapanIndia Defence Ministerial Meeting held in September 2017,
the ministers agreed to commence the discussions for research
collaboration. In July 2018, the two countries launched the
Cooperative Research on the Visual SLAM based GNSS
Augmentation Technology for UGV[17]/Robotics.
Progress has been made in discussions on defense
equipment and technology cooperation between the two
countries, including the second Japan-India Defence Industry
Business Forum, which was held in February 2019.

Between Japan and ASEAN member states, exchanges of
views have taken place regarding defense equipment and
technology cooperation in non-traditional security sectors,
such as humanitarian assistance, disaster relief, and maritime
security, through the Japan-ASEAN Defense Vice-Ministerial
Meetings and other occasions. Participating countries
have expressed their expectation for Japan’s cooperation
in effectively dealing with these issues. In the “Vientiane
Vision” announced by Japan at the ASEAN-Japan Defence
Ministers’ Informal Meeting held in November 2016, it
is stated that Japan’s defense equipment and technology
cooperation with ASEAN countries would be promoted with
a focus on the following three points: (1) equipment and
technology transfer, (2) human resources development, and
(3) holding seminars on defense industries.
As a specific initiative with the Philippines, an official
agreement was made on the transfer of MSDF’s TC90 training aircraft to the Philippine Navy at the JapanPhilippines Summit Meeting in September 2016. Based on
the agreement, two TC-90s were delivered to the Philippine
Navy in March 2017, followed by the delivery of the
remaining three TC-90s in March 2018. TC-90 pilot training
was conducted for pilots from the Philippine Navy at the
MSDF Tokushima Air Base from November 2016 to March
2018. Since April 2017, maintenance and repair assistance
by dispatched personnel from a Japanese maintenance
company has been provided. Regarding the transfer, it
was confirmed at the Japan-Philippines Defence Ministerial
Meeting in June 2018 that parts and maintenance equipment
of the UH-1H utility helicopters that became unnecessary


for the GSDF would also be granted to the Philippine Air
Force. After the signing of an arrangement between the
defense officials involved in the transfer in November 2018,
delivery of some components to the Philippines started in
March 2019 and was completed in September 2019. These
two transfers were cases of the application of the provision
of the SDF Act enforced in June 2017 that enables the MOD
to grant or transfer the equipment which is decommissioned
by the SDF to the governments of developing states for a
lower price than the current price (See Paragraph 3 below).
Further, in January 2019, a framework was established for
regular consultations of the Joint Working Group on Defence
Equipment and Technology Cooperation.
In November 2017, Japan and Thailand agreed to promote
future defense equipment and technology cooperation,
including early conclusion of the Agreement concerning the
Transfer of Defense Equipment and Technology.
Between Japan and Vietnam, the Terms of Reference
(TOR) for regular consultations concerning defense
equipment and technological cooperation was signed
during the Japan-Vietnam Defense Vice-Ministerial Level
Meeting in November 2016. Concerning the specific fields
of cooperation, the Memorandum on the Orientation of
Promotion of Defense Industry Cooperation was signed
during the Japan-Vietnam Defense Ministers’ Meeting in May
2019. In addition, at the Japan-Vietnam Leaders’ Working
Lunch held in July 2019, the leaders agreed on commencing
official negotiations for the Agreement concerning the
Transfer of Defense Equipment and Technology.
Japan and Malaysia signed the Japan-Malaysia
Agreement concerning the Transfer of Defence Equipment
and Technology[18] in April 2018.
The MOD will continue to promote cooperation for
humanitarian assistance and disaster relief as well as the
maritime security area through these initiatives.

Upon a request from His Majesty King Abdullah II ibn
Al Hussein, King of the Hashemite Kingdom of Jordan, in
August 2019, Japan lent a retired GSDF type-61 main battle
tank without charge to Jordan for display at the Royal Tank
Museum. Meanwhile, the King offered to donate an armored
vehicle developed in Jordan to the Japanese GSDF, which
the GSDF received in the same month.
In October 2019, a ceremony for the lending and donation
was held at the MOD. At the ceremony our Minister of
Defense and Jordanian ambassador extraordinary and
plenipotentiary to Japan delivered speeches, and signed
and exchanged letters. In November 2019, our ambassador
extraordinary and plenipotentiary to Jordan and the Director
of the Jordan Royal Tank Museum unveiled the loaned

to develop a foundation that will serve as the basis
for the international community to cooperate towards
improving the security environment. Among these
friendly nations, some have difficulties in acquiring
an adequate level of defense equipment on their own
because of their economic and fiscal situations. Some of
these states are requesting to use SDF’s equipment which
is no longer used. However, Article 9, paragraph (1) of
the Public Finance Act[20] stipulates that the Government
must receive reasonable consideration when transferring
or leasing any governmental properties including the
SDF’s equipment to other countries. Therefore, a grant
or a transfer for lower price than the current price is not
allowed unless otherwise provided.
Under these circumstances, to respond to the needs
of such friendly nations, a special provision to Article
9, paragraph (1) of the Public Finance Act was created
in the SDF Act and put into force in June 2017. This
provision enables the MOD to grant or transfer the SDF’s
equipment which is no longer used to the governments
of developing states for a lower price than the current
price.
Even in the case of granting or transferring equipment
for a lower price than the current price pursuant to this
provision, whether or not to transfer such equipment, and
to which government such equipment to be transferred,
will be determined on a case-by-case basis in light of
the Three Principles on Transfer of Defense Equipment
and Technology and other regulations. In addition, an
international agreement must be concluded between
the Governments of Japan and the recipient countries
to prevent extra-purpose use and third party transfer of
the transferred equipment without the prior consent of
Japan.[21]

###### 3


**❶ [Military Intelligence Collection]**

For formulating defense policy accurately in response to the

changes in the situation and for operating defense capabilities

effectively in dealing with various situations, it is necessary to

grasp medium- to long-term military trends in the neighboring

countries of Japan and to detect the indications of various

situations promptly. To this end, the Ministry of Defense (MOD)/

Self-Defense Forces (SDF) always makes efforts to collect

information swiftly and accurately by using various methods.

Examples of intelligence collection means used by the

MOD/SDF include: (1) collecting, processing and analyzing

military communications and signals emanating from

electronic weapons in the air over Japan; (2) collecting,

processing, and analyzing data from various imagery satellites

(including Information Gathering Satellite (IGS));[1] (3)


surveillance activities by ships, aircraft and other assets; (4)

collecting and organizing a variety of open source information;

(5) information exchanges with defense organizations of other

nations; and (6) intelligence collection conducted by defense

attachés and other offi cials.

As for defense attachés, the defense attaché assigned to

Malaysia took additional responsibility for Brunei in October

2019, and the defense attaché assigned to Belgium additionally

for the Mission of Japan to the European Union in February

2020. As of April 2020, 70 defense attachés are dispatched to

83 embassies and 6 missions and delegations (including 46

embassies, 1 mission and 1 delegation where defense attachés

are actually stationed).

**2** **Enhancement of Medical Functions**


For the SDF to perform its mission, SDF personnel
must remain in good health through appropriate health
management. Also, it is important for the SDF to make
continued efforts to enhance and strengthen its capabilities
in military medicine for protecting the lives of the personnel
engaging in a variety of services as much as possible.
Under the circumstances where the SDF’s missions are
becoming more diverse and internationalized, it is important


to appropriately and accurately carry out various medical
activities, such as medical support in disaster relief and
international peace keeping activities, and capacity building
in the medical fi eld.
The MOD/SDF, therefore, is enhancing and strengthening
its medical capabilities so that they can appropriately
respond to various emergency events and carry out its various
missions in Japan and abroad.

**❷ [SDF Hospitals Serving as Hub Hospitals with Enhanced Functions]**


The role of SDF hospitals is to admit and treat injured SDF
personnel and other persons transported from their area of
activity in various emergency situations, while in normal
circumstances these hospitals provide medical care to SDF
personnel and their families, etc. These hospitals also play the
role of educational institutions that train medical personnel


to maintain and enhance their skills.
In accordance with the NDPG and the MTDP, the MOD
will continue to concentrate human and medical resources
on the consolidation of SDF hospitals with increased
performance levels to establish an effi cient and high-quality

responded to about 6,600 ambulances in 2019.
In response to the spread of the novel coronavirus disease
(COVID-19) infection, the MOD/SDF has been accepting
COVID-19 patients at SDF hospitals and the National
Defense Medical College Hospital (NDMC Hospital) since
February 1, 2020. 430 COVID-19 patients in total (as of May
31) have been accepted by the SDF Central Hospital, SDF
district hospitals in Sapporo, Yokosuka, Hanshin, Fukuoka
and Kumamoto and the NDMC Hospital.

Expenditures)

In May 2019, SDF Central Hospital, with the participation
of GSDF Eastern Army, GSDF Medical School, Japanese
Red Cross Society, Japanese DMAT, Setagaya Medical
Association and others, implemented a drill to accept a
large number of injured people based on a scenario of a
Tokyo Inland Earthquake. Through such drills, SDF Central
Hospital strengthens collaboration with related organizations
and improves its ability as a medical institution equivalent
to a disaster base hospital. When CT scanners and other
equipment of private hospitals in Koriyama City were covered
with water due to the 2019 East Japan Typhoon (Typhoon
Hagibis), SDF Fuji Hospital dispatched a vehicle with
CT scanner for disaster relief at the request of Fukushima
Governor for the period from October 18 to November 5,
2019, and supported treatment of 230 patients.
As disaster relief concerning community acquired
infection of COVID-19, from May 2 to 14 the SDF Fuji
Hospital sent a CT diagnosis vehicle to the cruise ship Costa
Atlantica (with approximately 620 crews) where a mass
infection occurred while the ship was moored to a pier in
Nagasaki Prefecture. CT scan was conducted for 6 people.


See


The SDF Central Hospital and the NDMC Hospital are
designated as medical institution for Category 1 Infectious
Diseases[4] and have been implementing training for response
to infectious diseases. For example, the SDF Central Hospital
implements training to accept infectious disease patients on
a regular basis in preparation for the occurrence of Category
1 Infectious Diseases[5] to establish cooperation with relevant
institutions, which is necessary when such patients are
identifi ed. The training was useful in the activities to respond
to the spread of the COVID-19 infection.
Using the lessons learned through the activities in
response to the spread of the COVID-19 infection, the
MOD/SDF will further strengthen its hygiene functions by

implementing measures as follows in the fi rst and second
2020 supplementary budgets: preparation of medical
equipment including respirators and negative pressure
equipment to accept infected patients, ambulances necessary
for transportation of infected people, protective clothing

**❸ [Strengthening the Function of the NDMC ]**

As the only educational institution of the MOD/SDF for
the training of SDF personnel who are physicians (medical
offi cers), SDF personnel who are public health and registered
nurses (nursing offi cers) and technical offi cers, the NDMC
plays the role to train and produce the primary medical staff
for medical activities of the SDF as well as to maintain and
improve their skills.


In this context, the NDPG and the MTDP state that the
MOD/SDF will improve operations of the NDMC and
enhance its research functions, and endeavor to secure highquality talents.
Specifi cally, the MOD/SDF will strengthen the system
for training of excellent medical and nursing offi cers, and
improve the conditions for providing high-quality medical


Designated medical institutions for Category 1 Infectious Diseases are designated by the governor as medical institutions to hospitalize patients of Category 1 and Category 2 Infectious

The MOD/SDF will also enhance research functions of the
NDMC Research Institute and collaboration with medical
care departments of the GSDF, MSDF, and Air Self-Defense
Force (ASDF). Through these initiatives, the MOD/SDF will
further enhance the education/ research conditions at the


college.
The NDMC Research Institute started advanced research
of defense medicine in FY2015 and has been conducting
research contributing to SDF troop operation, which includes
research on explosion trauma and damage caused by shock
waves.

**Interaction with Local Communities**
**and Japanese Citizens**
###### 5


Various activities of the Ministry of Defense (MOD)/SelfDefense Forces (SDF) are hard to implement without the
understanding and cooperation of each and every person

**Section**

**Collaboration with Local Communities**

**1**


The National Defense Program Guidelines for FY2019 and
beyond (NDPG) provides that, in recent years, activities,
training and exercises of SDF and U.S. forces in Japan
(USFJ) are becoming more diverse and defense equipment
more sophisticated, and that, as a result, it is becoming all
the more important to gain understanding among and secure
cooperation from local governments and residents around
defense facilities.


and local governments. Therefore it is necessary to further
deepen the trust between local communities and people, and
the SDF.

Therefore, the NDPG provides that the MOD/SDF will
constantly and actively engage in public relations activities
regarding defense policies and activities, and that, upon
fi elding units and equipment of SDF or USFJ and conducting
training and exercises, the MOD/SDF will make careful,
detailed coordination to meet the desires and conditions of
local communities, while suffi ciently fulfi lling accountability.


**Chapter**


**❶ [Supporting Civilian Life]**

The MOD/SDF conduct activities to support the lives of

citizens in a range of fi elds, in response to requests from

local governments and relevant organizations. Such activities

contribute to further deepening the trust in the SDF, and

provide SDF personnel with pride and confi dence.

The GSDF handles the disposal of unexploded ordnance

and other dangerous explosives found throughout Japan. In

FY2019, there were 1,441 such cases (approx. 33 tons). In

particular, cases handled in Okinawa Prefecture accounted for

approx. 37% of the total cases. The MSDF clears and disposes

of underwater mines and other dangerous explosives, but there

was no such removal or disposal in FY2019.
The SDF not only tries to have interactions with local
residents by doing things like opening its camps and bases


to the public to the extent that they do not interfere with unit
activities, but also provides transportation and other assistance
at a variety of athletic events. In addition, it supports regional
medical treatment efforts by providing general medical care
at some SDF hospitals as well as conducting urgent transport

for emergency patients from isolated islands. Furthermore,
based on national and other policies,[1] the MOD/SDF ensures
opportunities for local small and medium sized enterprises to
receive orders, while taking effi ciency into account, by such
measures as the promotion of separated/divided ordering[2]
and the securing of competition amongst companies within
the same qualifi cation and grade divisions.[3]

See Reference 59 (Activities in Civic Life)

**❷ [Cooperation from Local Governments and Other Relevant Organizations for the SDF]**

(1) Recruitment of Uniformed SDF Personnel and Cooperation organizations is vital to secure highly qualifi ed personnel and

(2) Support for and Cooperation with SDF Activities

The SDF camps and bases maintain close relations with local
communities, and therefore, various forms of support and
cooperation from the local community are indispensable for
the SDF to conduct its diverse activities, including education
and training, and disaster relief. Moreover, units dispatched


overseas for international peace cooperation operations
and other duties receive support and cooperation from the
relevant organizations for the procedures involved.

The MOD/SDF are further strengthening cooperation with

relevant entities such as local governments, police and fi re

services in order to ensure immediate and sure activities by the

SDF in various contingencies.

with the purpose to enhance the diversity and efficiency
of Japan-U.S. bilateral training and exercises. Meanwhile,
problems related to restricted establishment and operations
of defense facilities have emerged due to the urbanization
of areas around many of the defense facilities. Also, another
problem is that frequent aircraft operations such as takeoffs
and landings cause noise and other issues, impacting the
living environment of local residential communities.
With that being said, defense facilities, as the foundation
that supports the defense capabilities of Japan and the JapanU.S. Security Arrangements, are indispensable for our
country’s security. Therefore, in order for the facilities to
exert their full function, it is necessary to maintain conditions
for constant and stable utilization by ensuring harmony
between the defense facilities and the surrounding areas as
well as obtaining the understanding and cooperation of the
local residents.
For that purpose, the MOD has taken measures to
prevent, reduce or mitigate aircraft noise and other impacts
caused by activities of the SDF or the U.S. Forces, or by
the establishment/operation of airports and other defense
facilities in the surrounding areas since 1974 based on the
Act on Improvement of Living Environment of Areas Around
Defense Facilities (Living Environment Improvement Act).
Taking into consideration the requests from the relevant
local governments, the MOD partially revised the Living
Environment Improvement Act in 2011, and conducted a
review to enable the Specified Defense Facilities Environs
Improvement Adjustment Grants to be applied to so-called
soft projects, such as aid for medical expenses. In addition,
the MOD added defense facilities to be eligible for these
grants. Focused work is also underway to provide sound


insulation at residences.
Regarding the Specified Defense Facilities Environs
Improvement Adjustment Grants, the MOD has implemented
initiatives such as the PDCA Cycle process since April 2014,
aiming to increase the effectiveness of these grants.
In response to the requests by related local governments,
the MOD continues to consider practical ways to achieve
more effective and efficient measures to harmonize defense
facilities and surrounding areas, in light of the severe fiscal
situation.

**2 Efforts to Develop Understanding and Cooperation**
Concerning the Stationing of the USFJ


Amid the increasingly severe security environment surrounding

Japan, maintaining the presence of the USFJ and its readiness is

vitally important for ensuring the security of Japan. For stable

stationing of the USFJ, it is essential to obtain understanding

and cooperation of the local governments and residents in

the vicinities of U.S. bases. The MOD will work to share this

recognition with the United States at various levels including

the Japan-U.S. Defense Ministerial Meeting. The ministry will

also constantly take various measures, including coordination

for unit operation of the USFJ with the local governments

and other parties, provision of subsidies pertaining to the

USFJ realignment, prompt information provision to the local

government in a case of incident or accidents, and exchange

promotion between the USFJ and local residents.

(Based on Contracts in FY2020)


(1) Coordination for Unit Operation of the USFJ with the Local
Governments, etc.

The MOD is working to promote local understanding of the

maintenance of USFJ facilities and unit operations through

coordination, including prior explanation to the relevant

local municipalities and residents at every occasion of USFJ

realignment, training, unit deployment, new equipment

deployment, etc.


(2) Subsidy, etc. to Promote the USFJ Realignment

During a period of time before and after the implementation
of the USFJ realignment[4] (10 years in principle), realignment
subsidies[5] will be granted to help to cover the expenses of
projects[6] which contribute to improving the convenience of
the lives of residents in local municipalities affected by the
realignment, and to stimulating the local industries. For that
purpose, they will be granted in accordance with progress
made in the steps of the realignment, after the Defense
Minister designates the specified defense facilities and
neighboring municipalities affected by the realignment. As
of April 2020, 14 municipalities for nine defense facilities
are eligible to receive the subsidies. In order to promote the
realignment, additional measures are taken with budgetary
provision.

(3) Ensuring Safety of Operations of the USFJ

Ensuring the safety of local residents is of prime importance in

USFJ operations, and no accident or incident must occur. In the

event of a crash, component fall/loss, precautionary landing

on civilian airports,[7] etc. of U.S. Forces aircraft, the MOD

urges the United States to make exhaustive measures for safety

management and recurrence prevention as well as prompt

information provision. The ministry also requests measures

such as suspension of flying according to the individual case.

The MOD promptly provides the relevant local governments,

etc. with explanation of the obtained information and takes

measures to ensure prompt and appropriate compensation for

the damage caused by the incident or accident.


See


Reference 60 (Outline of Measures to Promote Harmony
between Defense Facilities and Surrounding Areas)


Under the Realignment Special Measures Act, changes in the composition of units of those naval vessels (replacement of the aircraft carrier, at Commander Fleet Activities, Yokosuka, with
a nuclear aircraft carrier) that conduct operations integrally with U.S. air wings subject to realignment will be treated in the same way as the realignment of the USFJ.

Approximately 5.7 billion yen in the FY2020 budget

The specific scope of projects includes 14 projects identified by Article 2 of the enforcement ordinance of the Act on Special Measures on Smooth Implementation of the Realignment of
United States Forces in Japan, including education, sports, and cultural projects.

L di h th il t t d t t i f b lit i th i ft hil fl i


-----

The MOD not only listens to the results of accident
investigation and recurrence prevention measures of the
United States but also uses expert knowledge of the SDF
to determine their reasonableness. Furthermore, in July
2019, another effort was made by revising the guidelines
concerning aircraft accidents in order to further refine the
applicable policies and procedures in case of an accident
caused by U.S. military aircraft accidents outside of U.S.
Forces facilities and areas in Japan.
Considering anxiety and concerns among local residents,
Japan has been fully communicating its approach to the U.S.
side including at the top and ministerial levels. The two
countries closely cooperate to secure safe operation as the
top priority. The MOD is also concerned about the increasing
trend of accidents/incidents due to drinking caused by U.S.
Forces military personnel and others and has requested the
U.S. side on multiple occasions to reinforce official discipline
and personnel education. The United States has also taken
measures for its part, putting in place its guidelines for offduty action (liberty policy), including measures such as
alcohol restrictions at nighttime as well as curfews applying
to U.S. Forces personnel ranked below a certain rank. Both
the countries will continue cooperation to prevent recurrence
of incidents related to drinking.
In addition, the Government of Japan prepared Crime
Prevention Measures in Okinawa in June 2016 to deter crime
in Okinawa Prefecture and ensure the safety and security of
the people of Okinawa. Bolstering crime prevention patrol
operations and establishing a safe and secure environment
are the pillars of the Measures. The MOD is participating
in the Okinawa Local Safety Patrol Corps established in the
Okinawa General Bureau and will continue to cooperate with
the relevant ministries and agencies to make it an effective
crime-prevention effort.

(4) Promoting Exchange between the USFJ and Local Residents


based on laws (Article 105-1 of the Self-Defense Forces
Law or Article 1 of the Act to Restrict the Operation of
Fishing Boats) or a contract and compensates for losses
incurred from the restriction.
As an administrative measure to help people who
suffered losses in their fishery operation due to the
restriction or prohibition based on the provisions of the
acts but cannot receive compensation under the provisions
of the acts, the MOD provides relief money to people who
satisfy certain requirements.

(2) Base Subsidy, etc.
The MOD provides cooperation by doing such things
as providing various information also for the subsidy
for municipalities where national defense facilities are
located (“Base Subsidy”), and the Adjustment Grants
for municipalities where defense facilities are located
(“Adjustment Grants”), both of which are under the
defense facilities-related subsidy system under the
jurisdiction of the Ministry of Internal Affairs and
Communications.
The base subsidy has been established considering
that, among the facilities of the U.S. forces or the
facilities used by the SDF, the land used for airports
and maneuvering grounds covers a vast area that is a
big part of the municipality area, which has a significant
impact on municipal finance. The subsidy has a nature
of substituting for fixed property tax and is granted to
municipalities where national properties (land, building
and structure) provided for use by the USFJ or the SDF
are located.
The Adjustment Grants have been established because
the Base Subsidy is not granted to municipalities where
properties constructed or set up by the U.S. forces
(“USFJ properties”) are located despite their exemption
from fixed asset tax, and also considering the tax-fiscal
impact of the municipal tax exemption for U.S. Force
personnel and civilian employees. The grant is provided
to municipalities where the U.S. Force property is located.

**3 Activities of the MOD for Coexistence with the**
Environment and Society


**Chapter**


The MOD holds a Japan-U.S. exchange program to deepen
mutual understanding between Japan and the United
States with the understanding and cooperation of the local
governments and USFJ. Under the program, residents living
near USFJ facilities and areas together with USFJ personnel
enjoy sports, music and cultural exchanges.
The USFJ also has initiatives to deepen mutual
understanding with people of the local communities,
which include opening up of its bases (Friendship day) and
information provision through websites and social media.

(5) Other Measures (Including Measures Pertaining to the SDF)
(1) Compensation for Fisheries
The MOD defines the confined water for training, etc.
carried out by the SDF or the USFJ using water surface


A sense of crisis regarding the sustainability of the global
environment has been mounting internationally. In 2015
countries around the world advanced initiatives, such as the
adoption of the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) at
the United Nations and the Paris Agreement, which is an
international framework concerning climate change. Marine
plastic pollution and climate change were important topics at
the G20 Summit held in Osaka in June 2019. Just before the


-----

summit, the first Ministerial Meeting on Energy Transitions
and Global Environment for Sustainable Growth was held
with the attendance of relevant ministers of the participating
countries. Japan also formulated the Fifth Basic Environment
Plan at the cabinet in 2018 and has been working to realize
a sustainable society. At the SDG Summit in September
2019, Prime Minister Abe expressed the intention to further
accelerate initiatives in Japan and abroad by the next SDG
Summit. In response to the acceleration of domestic and
overseas initiatives, as a member of the government, the
MOD also needs to contribute to solving environmental
problems, while at the same time implementing measures
with more focus on the coexistence of SDF/USFJ facilities
and areas with surrounding areas.

(1) Efforts Related to the MOD/SDF Facilities


objective to ensure the health and safety of residents in
the vicinity of USFJ facilities and areas, U.S. Forces
personnel, their families and other such parties, and made
the “Joint Statement of Environmental Principles.”[9] To
follow up on this announcement, Japan-U.S. consultations
have been enhanced. The MOD has been working with
relevant ministries and agencies to enhance cooperation
for regular reviews of the JEGS compiled by the USFJ,
exchange information on the environment, and deal with
environmental pollution.
Furthermore, on September 28, 2015, the Governments
of Japan and the United States signed and effectuated the
Agreement on Cooperation in the Field of Environmental
Stewardship relating to the USFJ, supplementary to the
Status of U.S. Forces Agreement (SOFA) with the aim
of strengthening environmental measures pertaining to
USFJ facilities and areas. This supplementary agreement
represents an international commitment with legal binding
force and sets forth provisions concerning information
sharing by the two countries, access to USFJ facilities and
areas based on the report by the U.S. side at the time of an
environmental accident and access to facilities and areas
for investigation before their return.
In April 2020, in order to address an aqueous filmforming foam spill incident that occurred at Marine Corps
Air Station (MCAS) Futenma, access to MCAS Futenma
pursuant to the Supplementary Agreement by the
Government of Japan and the relevant local governments
has been realized for the first time. The MOD will
continue to cooperate closely with the relevant ministries,
local governments, and the U.S. Government to address
the concerns of local residents.

(2) Efforts to Save Utilities
In USFJ facilities and areas, efforts are made to save
utilities, which include changes to energy-efficient heating/
ventilation/air-conditioning equipment;installation of
motion sensors for lights-out during absence; installation
of solar panels; reduction of the period to use cooling/
heating equipment and review of the preset temperature;
and control of lighting and lights-out for night lighting,
for example.

compounds)


**Chapter**


(1) Banning the Use of Plastic Bags
In order to take the initiative in the environmental
measures of the government, the use of plastic bags was
banned in Ichigaya District with the cooperation of shops,
etc. on January 20, 2020. The MOD/SDF will ban the
use of plastic bags also in other bases and camps where
cooperation of shops is obtained to extend the ban across
the country.

(2) Review of Electric Power Procurement
From the standpoint of the MOD/SDF, which has 250,000
members and operates facilities throughout the country,
the problem of climate change is not an affair that concerns
only other people. For procurement of electric power in
FY2020, the MOD/SDF will review necessary electric
power procurement in order to use renewable energy as

much as possible after ensuring competitiveness, low
price and stable supply, and plans to procure approx.
9,100 kWh electric power from renewable energy sources
in the total of 151 facilities, etc. (on a contract basis)
across the country.

(2) Efforts on the USFJ Facilities and Areas


(1) Efforts Related to Environmental Conservation
For activities of the U.S. Forces in USFJ facilities
and areas, the USFJ developed Japan Environmental
Governing Standards (JEGS),[8] which provides that
generally the strictest regulation shall be adopted among
environmental preservation regulations of Japan, the
United States and international commitment. At the “2+2”
Meeting in September 2000, based on the recognition
that environmental conservation is important, the
governments of both nations agreed to make it a common


JEGS is the environmental standard compiled by the USFJ. In order to ensure that USFJ activities and installations protect human health and the natural environment and, it stipulates
matters such as the handling and storage methods of environmental pollutants within the facilities and areas.

**2 Response to Small Unmanned Aerial Systems Mainly Drones**

**1 Response to Cases of Interference against SDF and U.S.**
Forces Aircraft by Laser Irradiation and Kite Flying

Cases of interference by laser irradiation and kite flying
against the SDF and U.S. Forces aircraft in flight have been
occurring frequently. These are extremely dangerous and
malicious acts that may disrupt a pilot’s ability to operate
aircraft and result in a catastrophe such as a crash. Therefore,
the MOD disseminates information regarding the risks
involved in these acts to local residents by putting up posters
and requests their cooperation in reporting to the police
while closely cooperating with relevant local governments.
Additionally, the Ordinance for Enforcement of the Civil
Aeronautics Act was revised in December 2016, making
these interference acts subject to regulation as well as fines
and other penalties.


**Chapter**


In recent years there have been terror attacks overseas
(including attempted ones) using small drones, including
commercial drones, some of which are targeted at military
facilities. Given such a situation, there is a concern that drone
terror attacks on the SDF/USFJ facilities and areas can also
happen in Japan, and if these facilities are endangered, the
function as foundations to defend our nation can be seriously
affected. To address such a concern, the Act on Prohibition
of Flight of UASs around and over Key Facilities commonly
known as the “Drone Act” was enforced on June 13, 2019,
to prohibit small drones from flying over the SDF/USFJ
facilities and areas designated by the Minister of Defense.
Currently 27 SDF facilities where major SDF Headquarters,
etc. are located are designated for the prohibition.

**❶ [Various Public Relations Activities]**

As the activities of the MOD/SDF cannot be carried out
without the understanding and support of the Japanese
people, it is important to be proactive in undertaking easily
comprehensible public relations activities and to gain the
trust and cooperation of the public.
According to a “Public Opinion Survey on the SelfDefense Forces and Defense Issues” conducted by the
Cabinet Offi ce (in January 2018), public expectations and
evaluations towards the SDF have been increasing as the
scope of MOD/SDF activities has expanded both domestically
and internationally. In light of this result, the MOD/SDF
will continue to conduct a variety of PR activities, thereby
striving to ensure better understanding of the current status
of the MOD/SDF.
In addition, given that understanding and support from
foreign countries are also of utmost importance for the SDF
to conduct its missions successfully, it is essential that the
MOD strengthens efforts to provide information to foreign
countries about MOD/SDF initiatives, including about SDF
activities abroad.


has been striving to gain the understanding of people in
other countries by publishing the monthly English magazine,
“Japan Defense Focus (JDF), launching a Twitter account in
English, and improving the contents of the MOD’s English
website. It is proactively transmitting information to the
international community through efforts such as providing
international media with opportunities for press coverage,
publishing English versions of the defense white paper and
brochures, as well as producing PR videos.

**2 Events and PR Facilities**


**Chapter**


The MOD/SDF conducts activities to widely inform
nationals of the current circumstances of the SDF. These
activities include the GSDF Fuji Fire Power Exercise, cruises
to experience MSDF vessels, and demonstration fl ights and
boarding experiences on aircraft. In addition, at camps and
bases throughout the country, events including equipment
exhibitions and unit tours are held on occasions such as the
anniversary of a unit’s foundation. In some instances, they
also hold parades throughout the cities, with cooperation
from the local communities. Furthermore, as part of the
commemoration of the SDF anniversary, the SDF Marching
Festival is held at Nippon Budokan arena every year. In
2019 the festival was held in Gymnasium 1 of the National
Yoyogi Stadium due to renovation of Nippon Budokan, and
approximately 38,500 visitors in total came.
Concerning annual reviews by the SDF, a troop review, a

The MOD has also been making great efforts to provide
accurate information in a more extensive and timely fashion,
by creating brochures, PR videos, and “Guidebook to the
Ministry of Defense,” as well as providing assistance in
editing the PR magazine “MAMOR” and cooperation on
media coverage.

GSDF, MSDF, and ASDF respectively. In 2019, the MSDF
planned a fl eet review of the MSDF in Sagami Bay but
cancelled the review in order to expend all possible means
for disaster relief activities in response to the 2019 East
Japan Typhoon (Typhoon Hagibis) that hit Japan in October
of the same year.
The MOD/SDF also actively opens PR facilities to the
public. For instance, the number of visitors on the facility
tour at the PR facilities in the MOD at Ichigaya district


(Ichigayadai Tour) reached 460,000 as of the end of March
2020. Each SDF service also has a large-scale PR facility
in addition to PR facilities and archives at the SDF camps
and bases open to the public. Furthermore, the MOD/SDF
provides cooperation for shooting fi lms and TV programs.

Enlistment Experience Programs for groups, companies and

other organizations.[3] These programs are intended to promote

participants’ understanding of the SDF by offering opportunities

to experience the daily life and training of the SDF, as well


as to have direct contact with SDF personnel. In FY2019,

approximately 120 people participated in SDF Life Experience

Tours. From the private sector, the SDF received approximately

1,500 requests for Enlistment Experience Programs, and

approximately 20,000 employees experienced SDF life.


**❷ [Initiatives for Public Document Management and Information Disclosure]**


**1 Necessity of Proper Management of Public Records and Archives**
and Proper Operation of the Information Disclosure System

Democracy, which is the most important system of the country,
is founded on the principle that the public has access to
accurate information, thereby making appropriate judgment
and exercise of sovereignty. Administrative documents held
by the government are of the utmost importance for the
public’s access to accurate information. For this reason it is
an important responsibility for the government, including the
MOD/SDF, to manage information in an appropriate manner
and appropriately respond to the public’s information
disclosure requests.


**2 Promotion of Proper Management of Public Records and Archives,**
and Proper Operation of the Information Disclosure System


The MOD/SDF takes it seriously that the issues over daily reports

in South Sudan and Iraq brought about the public’s distrust in

the MOD/SDF. The MOD/SDF is making full efforts to prevent

recurrence based on the “Measures for Ensuring Appropriate

Management of Public Records” (Adopted by the Ministerial

Council on the Management of Administrative Documents and

Related Matters on July 20, 2018), which compiles measures

necessary for proper management of public records and archives by

the entire government. The MOD/SDF is also working for proper

management and response to requests for information disclosure

by reforming the awareness of personnel and the organization

culture, enhancing the checking framework, for example.

See Reference 63 (Record of Information Disclosure by the

See

Ministry of Defense (FY2019))


**Chapter**


**❸ [Initiatives for Policy Evaluation]**

**1 Engagement in Policy Evaluation**


**3 Initiatives for the Personal Data Protection System**


The MOD has been conducting the evaluation of various
policies based on its policy evaluation system. In FY2019,
the MOD conducted policy evaluations of research and
development (R&D) programs and projects concerning
Special Taxation Measures as well as the major policies and
programs of the NDPG and the MTDP.

**2 Promotion of Evidence-Based Policy Making (EBPM)**


In light of respecting individual rights in line with the
Act on the Protection of Personal Information Held by
Administrative Organs, the MOD takes measures to ensure
the security of the personal information under its control, and
discloses such information upon request.

**4** Appropriate Operation of the Whistleblower Protection System


The MOD is promoting EBPM by establishing a structure
for promotion of EBPM within the ministry, including the
establishment of a new position, “Director-General for
Evidence-based Policymaking” in FY2018.


The MOD sets up a system to handle whistleblowing
made by its officials, employees and outside workers,
establishing internal and external contact desks to deal with
whistleblowing and to protect whistleblowers.


Information on the Summer Tour/Spring Tour for College Students, Ms. Parsley Tour (trial tour for women in their 20s); and One-Day Visit to SDF for Women, etc. is available on the MOD/SDF website.

Tours to experience the everyday life in the GSDF, MSDF, and ASDF. They are implemented upon request from private companies and other organizations through the Provincial Cooperation Offices.

**Reference 1 National Security Strategy (Outline)**
(Approved by the National Security Council
and the Cabinet on December 17, 2013)
**I. Purpose**
❍ As Japan’s security environment becomes ever more severe, Japan needs
to identify its national interests from a long-term perspective, determine
the course it should pursue in the international community, and adopt a
whole-government approach for national security policies and measures
in order to continue developing a prosperous and peaceful society.
❍ In a world where globalization continues, Japan should play an even
more proactive role as a major global player in the international
community.
❍ The Strategy, as fundamental policies pertaining to national security,
presents guidelines for policies in areas related to national security.
❍ With the National Security Council (NSC) serving as the control tower,
as well as with strong political leadership, the Government of Japan will
implement national security policies in a more strategic and structured
manner through a whole-government approach.
❍ When implementing policies in other areas, the Government of Japan
will give due consideration to national security so that Japan can utilize
its strengths, such as its diplomatic ability and defense capability, in a
smooth and fully-functional way as a whole, based on the Strategy.
❍ The Strategy will guide Japan’s national security policy over the next
decade. Through the implementation of concrete policies, the NSC will
regularly carry out systematic evaluation and upgrade the Strategy in a
timely and appropriate manner.
**II. Fundamental Principle of National Security**
1. Principles Japan Upholds
❍ Japan is a country with rich culture and tradition, and upholds universal
values, such as freedom, democracy, respect for fundamental human
rights and the rule of law. Japan has a wealth of highly educated human
capital and high cultural standards, and is an economic power with
strong economic capacity and high technological capabilities. Japan
has achieved its development benefiting from an open international
economic system. In addition, Japan as a maritime state has pursued
“Open and Stable Seas.”
❍ Japan has consistently followed the path of a peace-loving nation
since the end of World War II, and has adhered to a basic policy of
maintaining an exclusively national defense-oriented policy, not
becoming a military power that poses a threat to other countries, and
observing the Three Non-Nuclear Principles.
❍ Japan has maintained its security, and contributed to peace and stability
in the Asia-Pacific region, by enhancing its alliance with the United
States (U.S.), as well as by deepening cooperative relationships with
other countries. Japan has also contributed to the realization of stability
and prosperity in the international community through initiatives
for supporting the economic growth of developing countries and for
addressing global issues based on the principle of human security, as
well as through trade and investment relations with other countries.
❍ Complying with the United Nations (U.N.) Charter, Japan has been
cooperating with the U.N. and other international organizations, and
has actively contributed to their activities. Japan has also continuously
participated in international peace cooperation activities. In addition, as
the only country to have ever suffered atomic bombings in war, Japan
has consistently engaged in disarmament and non-proliferation efforts,
playing a leading role in international initiatives to realize “a world free
of nuclear weapons.”
❍ Japan will continue to adhere to the course that it has taken to date
as a peace-loving nation, and as a major player in world politics and
economy, contribute even more proactively in securing peace, stability,
and prosperity of the international community, while achieving its own
security as well as peace and stability in the Asia-Pacific region, as a
“Proactive Contributor to Peace” based on the principle of international
cooperation. This is the fundamental principle of national security that
Japan should stand to hold.
2. Japan’s National Interests and National Security Objectives
National Interests
❍ To maintain its sovereignty and independence; to defend its territorial
integrity; to ensure the safety of life, person, and properties of its
nationals, and to ensure its survival while maintaining its own peace
and security and preserving its rich culture and tradition.
❍ To achieve the prosperity of Japan and its nationals through economic
development, thereby consolidating its peace and security (to this
end, it is essential that Japan strengthens the free trade regime and
realizes an international environment that offers stability, transparency
andpredictability).
❍ To maintain and protect international order based on rules and universal
values, such as freedom, democracy, respect for fundamental human
rights, and the rule of law.
National Security Objectives
❍ To strengthen the deterrence necessary for maintaining Japan’s peace
and security and for ensuring its survival, thus deterring threats from
directly reaching Japan; at the same time, if by any chance a threat


should reach Japan, to defeat such threat and to minimize the damage.
❍ To improve the security environment of the Asia-Pacific region,
and prevent the emergence of and reduce direct threats to Japan,
through strengthening the Japan-U.S. Alliance, enhancing the trust
and cooperative relationships between Japan and its partners within
and outside the Asia-Pacific region, and promoting practical security
cooperation.
❍ To improve the global security environment and build a peaceful,
stable, and prosperous international community by strengthening
the international order based on universal values and rules, and by
playing a leading role in the settlement of disputes, through consistent
diplomatic efforts and further personnel contributions.
**III. Security Environment Surrounding Japan and National Security Challenges**
1. Global Security Environment and Challenges
(1) Shift in the Balance of Power and Rapid Progress of Technological
Innovation
❍ The balance of power between nations is changing due to the rise
of emerging countries (e.g., China and India). In particular, China
is increasing its presence in the international community. The
United States, which has the world’s largest power as a whole, has
manifested its policy to shift its emphasis of national security and
economic policy towards the Asia-Pacific region.
❍ The rapid advancement of globalization and technological innovation
has increased the relative influence of non-state actors, and the threat
of terrorism and crimes committed by non-state actors is expanding.
(2) Threat of the Proliferation of Weapons of Mass Destruction and Other
Related Materials
❍ The issue of the transfer, proliferation, and performance improvement
of weapons of mass destruction (WMD) and their means of
delivery, such as ballistic missiles, the issue of nuclear and missile
development by North Korea, and the nuclear issue of Iran remain
major threats to Japan and the international community.
(3) Threat of International Terrorism
❍ International terrorism has spread and become diverse in its forms
due to the advancement of globalization.
❍ Terrorist attacks against Japanese nationals and interests have
actually taken place overseas. Japan and its people face the threat of
international terrorism both at home and abroad.
(4) Risks to Global Commons
❍ In recent years, risks that can impede the utilization of and free access
to global commons, such as the sea, outer space, and cyberspace,
have been spreading and become more serious.
❍ In the seas, in recent years, there have been an increasing number
of cases of unilateral actions in an attempt to change the status quo
by coercion with respect to natural resources and the security of
respective states.
❍ Due to these cases as well as piracy and other issues, there is a
growing risk of the stability of sea lanes and freedom of navigation
coming under threat.
❍ There exist risks that could impede the continuous and stable use of
outer space, including an increasing amount of space debris caused
by satellite collisions amongst others.
❍ Risks of cyber-attacks with the intent to disrupt critical infrastructure
and obstruct military systems are becoming more serious.
(5) Challenges to Human Security
❍ Global issues that cannot be dealt with by a single country—namely,
poverty, widening inequality, global health challenges including
infectious diseases, climate change and other environmental issues,
food security, and humanitarian crises caused by civil wars and
natural disasters—are emerging as critical and urgent issues of human
security, threatening the very survival and dignity of individuals.
❍ These challenges could have repercussions on peace and stability of
the international community.
(6) The Global Economy and Its Risks
❍ The risk of the expansion of an economic crisis from one country to
the entire global economy is growing.
❍ Signs of protectionism and reluctance towards the creation of new
trade rules are becoming apparent.
❍ The rise of resource nationalism in resource rich countries as well as
an intensified competition for the acquisition of energy and mineral
resources by emerging countries are observed.
2. Security Environment and Challenges in the Asia-Pacific Region
(1) Characteristics of the Strategic Environment of the Asia-Pacific
Region
❍ The region has various political regimes and a host of countries with
large-scale military forces including nuclear-weapon states. Yet a
regional cooperation framework in the security realm has not been
sufficiently institutionalized.
(2) North Korea’s Military Buildup and Provocative Actions
❍ North Korea has enhanced the capability of WMDs including nuclear
weapons and that of ballistic missiles. At the same time, North Korea
has repeatedly taken provocative military actions including the use
of provocative rhetoric against Japan and other countries, thereby


-----

increasing the tension in the region. The threat to the security of
Japan and of other countries is being substantially aggravated.
❍ As Kim Jong-un proceeds to consolidate his regime, the domestic
situation in North Korea needs to be closely monitored.
❍ North Korea’s abduction is a grave issue affecting Japan’s sovereignty
as well as the lives and safety of Japanese nationals. It is an urgent
issue for the Government of Japan to resolve under its responsibility.
(3) China’s Rapid Rise and Intensified Activities in Various Areas
❍ There is an expectation for China to share and comply with
international norms, and play a more active and cooperative role for
regional and global issues.
❍ China has been rapidly advancing its military capabilities in a wide
range of areas without sufficient transparency.
❍ China has taken actions that can be regarded as attempts to change
the status quo by coercion based on their own assertions, which
are incompatible with the existing order of international law, in the
maritime and aerial domains, including the East China Sea and the
South China Sea (e.g., intrusion into Japan’s territorial waters and
airspace around the Senkaku Islands, establishment of its own “Air
Defense Identification Zone”).
❍ The cross-strait relationship has deepened economically. Meanwhile,
the military balance has been changing. Thus, the relationship
contains both orientations towards stability and potential instability.
**IV. Japan’s Strategic Approaches to National Security**
1. Strengthening and Expanding Japan’s Capabilities and Roles

-  To ensure national security, Japan needs to first and foremost strengthen
its own capabilities and the foundation for exercising those capabilities.
Japan must also steadily fulfill the role it should play and adapt its
capabilities to respond to future developments.

-  Enhancing Japan’s resilience in national security, through reinforcing its
diplomatic power and defense force, as well as bolstering its economic
strengths and technological capabilities, contributes to peace and stability
in the Asia-Pacific region and the international community at large.

-  In order to overcome national security challenges and achieve national
security objectives, as well as to proactively contribute to peace in
cooperation with the international community, Japan needs to expand and
deepen cooperative relationships with other countries, with the JapanU.S. Alliance as the cornerstone. At the same time, Japan needs to make
effective use of its diverse resources and promote comprehensive policies.
(1) Strengthening Diplomacy for Creating a Stable International
Environment
❍ The key of national security is to create a stable and predictable
international environment, and prevent the emergence of threats.
❍ It is necessary for Japan to realize an international order and security
environment that are desirable for Japan, by playing an even more
proactive role in achieving peace and stability of the international
community as a “Proactive Contributor to Peace” based on the principle
of international cooperation.
❍ It is necessary to enhance diplomatic creativity and negotiating power
to deepen the understanding of and garner support for Japan’s position
in the international community.
❍ By highlighting Japan’s attractiveness, Japan needs to strengthen its
soft power that would benefit the international community. Japan also
needs to strengthen its capacity to promptly and accurately identify
the needs of Japanese nationals and firms to support their overseas
activities.
❍ Japan will make even more proactive contributions to international
organizations such as the U.N., including through increasing the
number of Japanese staff in such institutions.
(2) Building a Comprehensive Defense Architecture to Firmly Defend
Japan
❍ Amid the severe security environment, Japan will efficiently develop
a highly effective joint defense force, adapting to the change in
strategic environment with consideration of its national power, and
strive to ensure operations with flexibility and readiness based on joint
operations.
❍ Japan will advance coordination within the government and with local
governments and the private sector. In doing so, even in peacetime,
Japan will maintain and improve a comprehensive architecture for
responding seamlessly to an array of situations, ranging from armed
attacks to large-scale natural disasters.
❍ In developing the structure of the Japan Self-Defense Forces (SDF),
which plays a central role in these efforts, Japan will enhance its defense
structure for deterrence and response to various situations, prioritizing
important functions from a joint and comprehensive perspective.
❍ With regard to the threat of nuclear weapons, the extended deterrence
of the U.S. with nuclear deterrence at its core is indispensable. In order
to maintain and enhance the credibility of the extended deterrence,
Japan will work closely with the U.S., and take appropriate measures
through its own efforts, including ballistic missile defense (BMD) and
protection of the people.
(3) Strengthening Efforts for the Protection of Japan’s Territorial Integrity
❍ Japan will enhance the capabilities of the law enforcement agencies


responsible for territorial patrol activities and reinforce its maritime
surveillance capabilities.
❍ Japan will strengthen coordination among relevant ministries and
agencies to be able to respond seamlessly to a variety of unexpected
situations.

developing “Open and Stable Seas,” which are upheld by maritime order
based upon such fundamental principles as the rule of law, ensuring
the freedom and safety of navigation and overflight, and peaceful
settlement of disputes in accordance with relevant international law,
rather than by force.
❍ Japan will strengthen its maritime domain awareness capabilities in
a comprehensive manner that involves the use of outer space, while
paying attention to the establishment of international networks.
❍ Japan will provide assistance to those coastal states alongside the sea
lanes of communication and other states in enhancing their maritime
law enforcement capabilities, and strengthen cooperation with partners
on the sea lanes who share strategic interests with Japan.
(5) Strengthening Cyber Security
❍ Japan as a whole will make concerted efforts to defend cyberspace
and strengthen the response capability against cyber-attacks, so as to
protect cyberspace from malicious activities; to ensure the free and safe
use of cyberspace; and to guard Japan’s critical infrastructure against
cyber-attacks, including those in which state involvement is suspected.
❍ Japan will constantly strengthen public-private partnership, and will
comprehensively consider and take necessary measures with regard to
expanding the pool of human resources in the security field, etc.
❍ Japan will take measures at technical and operational levels to enhance
international cooperation, and will promote cyber defense cooperation.
(6) Strengthening Measures against International Terrorism
❍ Japan will first and foremost strengthen its domestic measures against
international terrorism such as ensuring the security of nuclear
facilities in Japan. In order to ensure the safety of Japanese nationals
living abroad, Japan will strengthen such measures as collecting and
analyzing intelligence on the situation of international terrorism.
(7) Enhancing Intelligence Capabilities
❍ Japan will fundamentally strengthen its information-collecting
capabilities from a diverse range of sources, including human
intelligence and open source intelligence.
❍ Japan will enhance its intelligence analysis, consolidation, and
sharing capabilities including by developing experts, and will promote
allsource analysis that makes use of the array of information-collecting
means at the Government’s disposal. Materials and intelligence will be
provided to the NSC in a timely manner, and they will be appropriately
utilized in policy formulation.
(8) Defense Equipment and Technology Cooperation
❍ From the perspective of “Proactive Contribution to Peace” based on the
principle of international cooperation, Japan is required to contribute
more proactively to peace and international cooperation including
through utilizing defense equipment, and to participate in joint
development and production of defense equipment and other related
items.
❍ While giving due consideration to the roles that the Three Principles
on Arms Exports and their related policy guidelines have played so far,
the Government of Japan will set out clear principles on the overseas
transfer of arms and military technology, which fit the new security
environment. In this context, considerations will be made with regard
to defining cases where transfers are prohibited; limiting cases where
transfers could be allowed with strict examination; and ensuring
appropriate control over transfers in terms of unauthorized use and
third party transfer.
(9) Ensuring the Stable Use of Outer Space and Promoting Its Use for
Security Purposes
❍ Japan will engage itself in enhancing the functions of
informationgathering satellites and in making effective use of satellites.
Japan will also enhance a system for space situational awareness.
❍ Japan will promote the development and utilization of outer space
in a manner that contributes to national security in the medium- to
longterm, including the development of technologies.
(10) Strengthening Technological Capabilities
❍ Japan should encourage the further promotion of technologies,
including dual use technologies, thereby strengthening Japan’s
technological capabilities.
❍ Japan will constantly grasp science and technology trends, and make
effective use of technology in the area of security by combining the
efforts of industries, academia, and the Government.
❍ Japan will proactively utilize its internationally outstanding

cooperation on a wide range of areas for peace, stability, and prosperity
of not only the two countries themselves, but also the Asia-Pacific region
and the broader international community.

-  The U.S., based on its Defense Strategic Guidance emphasizing a
rebalancing towards the Asia-Pacific region, aspires to enhance its
presence in the region and strengthen cooperation with its allies, including
Japan and its partners.

-  In order to ensure the security of Japan and to maintain and enhance peace,
stability, and prosperity in the Asia-Pacific region and the international
community, Japan must further elevate the effectiveness of the JapanU.S. security arrangements and realize a stronger Japan-U.S. Alliance.

extremely high speeds. Changes in the balance of power in the international
arena are accelerating and becoming more complex, and uncertainty over the
existing order is increasing. In addition, rapid expansion in the use of new
domains, which are space, cyberspace and electromagnetic spectrum is poised
to fundamentally change the existing paradigm of national security, which
has prioritized responses in traditional, physical domains, which are land, sea
and air.
Even under these circumstances, Japan will vigorously march forward
as a peace-loving nation. To do so, Japan, amid the dramatically changing
security environment, needs to fundamentally strengthen its national defense
architecture with which to protect, by exerting efforts on its own accord and
initiative, life, person and property of its nationals, territorial land, waters
and airspace, and its sovereignty and independence, thereby expanding roles
Japan can fulfill. Today, no country can preserve its security by itself alone.
Strengthening the Japan-U.S. Alliance as well as security cooperation with
other countries are critical to Japan’s national security, and this cannot be
achieved without Japan's own efforts. The international community also
expects Japan to play roles that are commensurate with its national power.
In strengthening its defense capability, Japan must squarely face
the aforementioned realities of national security and ensure necessary
and sufficient quality and quantity so as to build a truly effective defense
capability that does not lie on a linear extension of the past. In particular, it
has become essential that Japan achieve superiority in new domains, which
are space, cyberspace and electromagnetic spectrum. To build a new defense
capability that combines strengths across all domains, Japan needs to engage
in a transformation at a pace that is fundamentally different from the past,
completely shedding the thinking that relies on traditional division among
land, sea, and air. On the other hand, given the rapidly aging population with
declining birthrates and severe fiscal situation, Japan cannot strengthen its
defense capability without thorough rationalization that does not dwell on
the past.
The Japan-U.S. Alliance, together with Japan's own defense architecture,
continues to be the cornerstone of Japan’s national security. As stated above,
Japan's fulfillment of its foremost responsibility as a sovereign nation is the
very way to fulfill its roles under the Japan-U.S. Alliance and further enhance
the Alliance’s ability to deter and counter threats, and is a foundation upon
which to strategically promote security cooperation in line with the vision of
free and open Indo-Pacific.
Based on the foregoing thoughts, the Government, in line with “On
National Security Strategy” (approved by the National Security Council and
the Cabinet on December 17, 2013, and hereinafter referred to as “National
Security Strategy”), hereby sets forth the “National Defense Program
Guidelines for FY 2019 and beyond” as the new guidelines regarding how
Japan’s national defense ought to be to form the foundation of Japan’s future.

**II. Security Environment Surrounding Japan**
1. Characteristics of current security environment
In the international community, interdependency among countries further
expands and deepens. On the other hand, thanks to further growth of national
power of such countries as China, changes in the balance of power are
accelerating and becoming more complex, thereby increasing uncertainty
over the existing order. Against such a backdrop, prominently emerging are
inter-state competitions across the political, economic and military realms, in
which states seek to shape global and regional order to their advantage as well
as to increase their influence.
These inter-state competitions occur on a continuous basis: In conducting
inter-state competitions, states leverage various means such as undermining
other country’s sovereignty using military and law-enforcement entities, and
manipulating foreign country’s public opinion by exploiting social media.
Also, the so-called gray-zone situations are becoming persistent over a long
period of time, playing out as part of inter-state competitions. They may
possibly further increase and expand.
Such gray-zone situations harbor the risk of rapidly developing into graver
situations without showing clear indications. In addition, methods employed
to alter the status quo, such as “hybrid warfare,” that intentionally blur the
boundaries between the military and non-military realms are forcing affected
actors to take complex measures not limited to military ones.
Driven by rapid technological innovation in information &
communications and other fields, military technologies are showing
remarkable advances. Against the backdrop of such technological advances,
contemporary warfare increasingly features capabilities combined across all
domains: not only land, sea and air but also new domains, which are space,
cyberspace and electromagnetic spectrum. Aiming to improve overall military
capability, states are seeking to gain superiority in technologies that undergird
capabilities in new domains. Since space and cyber domains are widely used
for civilian purposes, if stable use of these domains is impeded, it may entail
serious consequences for the safety of state and its citizens.
Due to advances in military technologies, a variety of threats can now
easily penetrate national borders. States endeavor to develop weapons that
leverage cutting-edge, potentially game-changing technologies. They also
engage in research of autonomous unmanned weapon systems equipped with
artificial intelligence (AI). Further technological innovations hereafter are
expected to make it difficult still to foresee future warfare.


(December 18, 2018)
**I. NDPG’s Objective**
Japan since the end of World War II has consistently treaded the path of a
peace- loving nation. This has been accomplished by the persistent efforts of
our forerunners under the principle of maintaining peace.
The most consequential responsibility of the Government of Japan is
to maintain Japan’s peace and security, to ensure its survival and to defend
to the end Japanese nationals’ life, person and property of its nationals and
territorial land, waters and airspace. This is the foremost responsibility that
Japan must fulfill as a sovereign nation. Carrying out this responsibility by
exerting efforts on its own accord and initiative is at the very heart of Japan’s
national security. Japan’s defense capability is the ultimate guarantor of its
security and the clear representation of the unwavering will and ability of
Japan as a peace-loving nation. And maintaining Japan’s peace and security is
an essential premise for its prosperity.
At present, security environment surrounding Japan is changing at


-----

In the international community, there is a broadening and diversifying
array of security challenges that cannot be dealt with by a single country alone.
With respect to space and cyber domains, establishing international rules and
norms has been a security agenda. In maritime domain, there have been cases
where country unilaterally claims its entitlements or take actions based on its
own assertions that are incompatible with existing international order. These
have generated undue infringement upon freedom in high seas. In addition, the
proliferation of weapons of mass destruction including nuclear, biological and
chemical weapons, and ballistic missiles as well as worsening international
terrorism remain grave challenges for the international community.
Against such background, qualitatively and quantitatively superior
military powers concentrate in Japan’s surroundings where clear trends are
observed in further military build-up and increase in military activities.

2. Situations by country and region
While remaining to possess the world’s largest comprehensive national
power, the United States, with inter-state competitions in a range of areas
prominently emerging, has acknowledged that particularly important
challenge is strategic competition with China and Russia who attempt to alter
global and regional order.
To rebuild its military power, the United States is engaged in such efforts
as maintaining military advantage in all domains through technological
innovations, enhancing nuclear deterrent, and advancing missile defense
capabilities. The United States upholds defense commitments to allies and
partners and maintains forward force presence, while calling on them to share
greater responsibility. The United States frames the Indo-Pacific as a priority
region where it adopts a policy of strengthening alliances and partnerships.
Member states of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO)
including the United States are reviewing their strategies to deal with coercive
attempts to alter the status-quo as well as “hybrid warfare.” In view of changes
in the security environment, NATO member states have been increasing their
defense expenditures.
With an aim to build “world-class forces” by the mid-21st century, China
has sustained high-level growth of defense expenditures with continued
lack of transparency. China has engaged in broad, rapid improvement of its
military power in qualitative and quantitative terms with focus on nuclear,
missile, naval and air forces. In so doing, China attaches importance to
ensuring superiority in new domains: it is rapidly advancing capabilities
in cyber and electromagnetic domains with which to disrupt opponent’s
command and control; and continues to enhance space domain capabilities
through developing and experimenting anti-satellite weapons. China is also
improving missile defense penetration capabilities and amphibious landing
capabilities. Such capability enhancement serves to improve the so-called
Anti-Access/Area Denial (“A2/AD”) capabilities—capabilities to deny access
and deployment of foreign militaries to one’s surrounding areas and to disrupt
their military operations therein—as well as to build capabilities with which
to conduct military operations over greater distances. In addition, China is
promoting civil-military integration policy in areas of national defense,
science & technology and industry, and actively developing and acquiring
cutting-edge technologies of potential military utility. Also, maritime law
enforcement agencies and the military are improving their collaboration.
China engages in unilateral, coercive attempts to alter the status quo based
on its own assertions that are incompatible with existing international order.
In the East China Sea and other waters, China is expanding and intensifying
its military activities at sea and in the air. Around the Senkaku Islands, an
inherent part of Japanese territory, Chinese government vessels continually
violate Japanese territorial waters despite Japan’s strong protests while
Chinese naval ships continuously operate in waters around the Islands. China
is also expanding its military activities in the Pacific Ocean and the Sea
of Japan. In particular, the Chinese military in recent years has frequently
advanced to the Pacific, with its navigation routes and unit composition
becoming more diverse. In the South China Sea, China has forcibly conducted
large-scale, rapid reclamation of maritime features, which are being converted
into military foothold. China in the South China Sea is also expanding and
intensifying its maritime and air activities.
Such Chinese military and other developments, coupled with the lack of
transparency surrounding its defense policy and military power, represent
a serious security concern for the region including Japan and for the
international community. Japan needs to continue to pay utmost attention to
these developments. China is eagerly expected to play active roles in a more
cooperative manner in the region and the international community.
North Korea in recent years has launched ballistic missiles at unprecedented
frequency, rapidly improving its operational capabilities such as simultaneous
launch and surprise attack. Given technological maturity obtained through a
series of nuclear tests, North Korea is assessed to have already successfully
miniaturized nuclear weapons to fit ballistic missile warheads. Although North
Korea expressed its intention for complete denuclearization of the Korean
Peninsula and blew up in public its nuclear test site, it has not carried out the
dismantlement of all weapons of mass destruction and ballistic missiles of all
ranges in a complete, verifiable and irreversible manner: There has been no
essential change in North Korea’s nuclear and missile capabilities.
North Korea is assessed to possess large-scale cyber units as part of its
asymmetric military capabilities, engaging in theft of military secrets and


developing capabilities to attack critical infrastructure of foreign countries.
North Korea also retains large-scale special operation forces.
Such military developments of North Korea pose grave and imminent
threats to Japan’s security and significantly undermine peace and security of
the region and the international community. Through United Nations Security
Council resolutions, the international community also has made it clear that
North Korea’s nuclear- and ballistic missile-related activities constitute a
clear threat to international peace and security.
Russia is enhancing its military posture by continuing force modernization
efforts with a focus on nuclear forces. Russia is in sharp confrontation with
Europe and the United States over issues including situation in Ukraine.
Russia’s military activities are trending upward in the Arctic Circle, Europe,
areas around the United States and the Middle East, as well as in the Far East
including Japan’s Northern Territories. Close attention therefore needs to be
paid to its developments.

3. Characteristics of Japan
Surrounded by sea on all sides and with long coastlines, Japan possesses
numerous islands remote from the mainland and is blessed with vast
Exclusive Economic Zones: spread widely therein are life, person and
property of its nationals, territorial land, waters and airspace, as well as
various resources, all of which Japan must defend to the end. For Japan, a
maritime nation dependent on overseas trade for the bulk of energy resources
and food supplies, fundamental to its peace and prosperity is to ensure the
safety of maritime and air traffic by strengthening the order of “Open and
Stable Oceans,” an order based on fundamental norms such as rule of law and
freedom of navigation.
Japan is prone to natural disasters that exact heavy damage. Industry,
population and information infrastructure concentrate in Japan’s urban areas,
and a large number of critical facilities such as nuclear power plants are
located in coastal areas.
In addition, Japan is undergoing population decline and ageing with
dwindling birthrate at unprecedented pace. Severe fiscal conditions continue
as well.

4. Summary
In light of the foregoing, while the probability of a large-scale military
conflict between major countries, which was of concern during the Cold
War era, remains low, Japan’s security environment is becoming more
testing and uncertain at a remarkably faster speed than expected when the
“National Defense Program Guidelines for FY 2014 and beyond” (approved
by the National Security Council and the Cabinet on December 17, 2013 and
hereinafter referred to as the “former Guidelines”) was formulated.
To prevent threats to Japan from materializing to menace life and peaceful
livelihood of its nationals, it behooves Japan to take measures that are in line
with these realities.

**III. Japan’s Basic Defense Policy**
In line with the National Security Strategy and from the perspective of
“Proactive Contribution to Peace,” Japan has enhanced its diplomatic strength
and defense capability. Japan has also expanded and deepened cooperative
relationships with other countries, with the Japan-U.S. Alliance being a
cornerstone. In so doing, Japan under the Constitution has adhered to the
basic precept of maintaining the exclusively defense- oriented policy and not
becoming a military power that poses threat to other countries, ensured civilian
control of the military, and observed the Three Non-Nuclear Principles.
Japan under these precepts will ever not change the course it has taken as
a peace- loving nation. Based on this premise, Japan, even amid the realities
of security environment it has hitherto never faced, must strive to preserve
national interests identified in the National Security Strategy—defend to the
end Japanese nationals’ life, person and property, territorial land, waters and
airspace, and its sovereignty and independence. To that end, the Government
will identify national defense objectives and the means to achieve them, and
proactively and strategically promote measures with added variety.
National defense objectives are: first, to create, on a steady-state basis,
security environment desirable for Japan by integrating and drawing on the
strengths at the nation’s disposal; second, to deter threat from reaching Japan
by making opponent realize that doing harm to Japan would be difficult and
consequential; and finally, should threat reach Japan, to squarely counter the
threat and minimize damage.
Japan will strengthen each of the means by which to successfully achieve
these national defense objectives: Japan’s own architecture for national
defense; the Japan-U.S. Alliance; and international security cooperation.
These efforts, including achieving superiority in new domains, which are
space, cyberspace, and electromagnetic spectrum, must be carried out swiftly
and flexibly in order to deal with increasingly complex security environment
that is changing at accelerating speeds.
In dealing with the threat of nuclear weapons, U.S. extended deterrence,
with nuclear deterrence at its core, is essential: Japan will closely cooperate
with the United States to maintain and enhance its credibility. To deal with the
threat, Japan will also increase its own efforts including comprehensive air
and missile defense as well as civil protection. At the same time, towards the
long-term goal of bringing about a world free of nuclear weapons, Japan will


-----

play an active and positive role in nuclear disarmament and non-proliferation.

1. Strengthening Japan’s own architecture for national defense
(1) Building comprehensive architecture for national defense
In order to squarely address the realities of security environment that it has
hitherto never faced and to securely achieve national defense objectives,
Japan will build national defense architecture that in all phases integrates the
strengths at the nation’s disposal: this structure enables not only Ministry of
Defense (MOD) and Self-Defense Forces (SDF) efforts but also coherent,
whole-of-government efforts; and enables cooperation with local governments
and private entities. In particular, Japan will accelerate its efforts and
cooperation in such fields as space, cyberspace, electromagnetic spectrum,
ocean, and science & technology, and also promote measures concerning the
formulation of international norms in fields such as space and cyberspace.
Japan will further advance steady-state efforts such as strategic
communications by systematically combining all available policy tools.
In order to address a range of situations including armed contingencies
and “gray- zone” situations, Japan has been strengthening its posture under
the principle of civilian control of the military. Japan further needs to
seamlessly deal with various situations in a coherent, whole-of-government
manner by way of swift and pertinent decision-making under even stronger
political leadership, which will be assisted by enhanced support mechanism.
In view of protecting the life, person and property of its nationals, Japan
will also continue to strengthen organization for disaster response and civil
protection, and, in cooperation with local governments, work to secure
evacuation facilities. Japan will build a posture fully prepared to evacuate
Japanese nationals overseas during emergencies and ensure their safety. Japan
will promote measures to protect infrastructure critical to people’s daily lives
such as electricity and communication as well as to protect cyberspace.
In addition to making aforementioned efforts, in order to ensure the
effectiveness of various policies and measures, Japan will, on a steady-state
basis, devise and review relevant plans while systematizing them; also,
expand the use of simulations and comprehensive training and exercises to
improve the effectiveness of emergency response posture.

(2) Strengthening Japan’s defense capability
a. Significance and necessity of defense capability
Defense capability is the ultimate guarantor of Japan’s national security.
Defense capability represents Japan’s will and ability to: deter threat from
reaching Japan; and should threat reach Japan, eliminate the threat and, as a
sovereign nation, by exerting efforts on its own accord and initiative, defend
to the end Japanese nationals’ life, person and property as well as territorial
land, waters and airspace.
At the same time, defense capability is essential for Japan to play on its
initiative its roles in the Japan-U.S. Alliance at all phases from peacetime to
armed contingencies. Strengthening Japan’s defense capability to provide for
national security is none other than strengthening the Japan-U.S. Alliance.
Defense capability is essential also for advancing Japan’s efforts in security
cooperation with other countries.
Defense capability is the most important strength for Japan in retaining
self- sustained existence as a sovereign nation amid security environment
it has never faced before. Japan must strengthen this capability on its own
accord and initiative.
b. Truly effective defense capability – Multi-domain Defense Force
To be able to deter and counter qualitatively and quantitatively superior
military threats in increasingly testing security environment, it has become
vitally important to adapt to warfare that combines capabilities in new
domains—space, cyberspace and electromagnetic spectrum—and traditional
domains—land, sea and air.
Japan needs to develop, while qualitatively and quantitatively enhancing
capabilities in individual domains, a defense capability that can execute
cross-domain operations, which organically fuse capabilities in all domains
to generate synergy and amplify the overall strength, so that even when
inferiority exists in individual domains such inferiority will be overcome and
national defense accomplished.
In order to ensure national defense in increasingly uncertain security
environment, it is also important for Japan to be able to seamlessly conduct
activities at all stages from peacetime to armed contingencies. To date,
Japan has endeavored to develop a defense capability that allows to engage
in diverse activities in a swift and sustainable manner. In recent years,
however, SDF has had to increase the scope and frequency of its steady-state
activities such as maintaining presence, as well as intelligence, surveillance
and reconnaissance (ISR) activities: This is exacting a chronic burden on its
personnel and equipment, generating a concern that SDF may not be able to
maintain proficiency and the volume of its activities.
Japan needs to: improve quality and quantity of capabilities that support
sustainability and resiliency of various activities; and develop a defense
capability that enables sustained conduct of flexible and strategic activities
commensurate with the character of given situations.
Further, Japan’s defense capability needs to be capable of strengthening
the ability of the Japan-U.S. Alliance to deter and counter threats as well as
promoting multi-faceted and multi-layered security cooperation.
In light of the foregoing, Japan will henceforth build a truly effective


defense capability, Multi-Domain Defense Force, which: organically fuses
capabilities in all domains including space, cyberspace and electromagnetic
spectrum; and is capable of sustained conduct of flexible and strategic
activities during all phases from peacetime to armed contingencies. The
development of “Multi-Domain Defense Force” will be done while honing
the attributes of “Dynamic Joint Defense Force” under the former Guidelines.

(3) Roles that defense capability should play
In order to create a security environment desirable for Japan and to deter and
counter threats, Japan’s defense capability must be able to serve the roles
specified below in a seamless and combined manner. In particular, in view
of protecting the life and peaceful livelihood of Japanese nationals, it is all
the more important for Japan’s defense capability to fulfill diverse roles on a
steady-state basis.
a. From peacetime to “gray-zone” situations
SDF will enhance its presence on a steady-state basis by actively engaging in,
among others, bilateral/multilateral training and exercises and overseas port
visits, thereby demonstrating Japan’s will and capability. SDF will, in close
integration with diplomacy, promote strategic communications including
aforementioned activities by SDF units. SDF will leverage its capabilities
in all domains to conduct wide-area, persistent intelligence, surveillance
and reconnaissance (hereinafter referred to as “persistent ISR”) activities
around Japan. SDF will prevent occurrence or escalation of emergencies by
employing flexible deterrent options and other measures. Leveraging posture
in place for these activities, SDF will, in coordination with the police and
other agencies, immediately take appropriate measures in response to actions
that violate Japan’s sovereignty including incursions into its territorial
airspace and waters.
SDF will provide persistent protection against incoming ballistic missiles
and other threats, and minimize damage should it occur.
b. Attack against Japan including its remote islands
In response to attack on Japan including its remote islands, SDF will quickly
maneuver and deploy requisite units to block access and landing of invading
forces while ensuring maritime and air superiority. Even when maintaining
maritime and air superiority becomes untenable, SDF will block invading
forces’ access and landing from outside their threat envelopes. Should
any part of the territory be occupied, SDF will retake it by employing all
necessary measures.
Against airborne attack by missiles and aircraft, SDF will respond in a
swift and sustained manner by applying optimal means and minimize damage
to maintain SDF’s capabilities as well as the infrastructure upon which such
capabilities are employed.
In response to attack by guerrillas or special operations forces, SDF
will protect critical facilities including nuclear power plants and search and
destroy infiltrating forces.
c. Space, cyber and electromagnetic domains during all phases
In space, cyber and electromagnetic domains, to prevent any actions that
impede its activities, SDF will conduct on a steady-state basis persistent
monitoring as well as collection and analysis of relevant information. In case
of such event, SDF will promptly identify incidents and take such measures
as damage limitation and recovery.
In case of armed attack against Japan, SDF will, on top of taking these
actions, block and eliminate the attack by leveraging capabilities in space,
cyber and electromagnetic domains.
In addition, in light of the society’s growing dependence on space and
cyberspace, SDF will contribute to comprehensive, whole-of-government
efforts concerning these domains under appropriate partnership and shared
responsibility with relevant organizations.
d. Large-scale disasters
In case of large-scale disasters, to protect the life, person, and property of
Japanese nationals, SDF will swiftly transport and deploy requisite units to
take all necessary measures for initial response, and, as required, maintain its
posture for disaster response for a longer term. SDF will carefully address the
needs of affected citizens and local governments, and engage in life saving,
temporary repair and livelihood support in appropriate partnership and
cooperation with relevant organizations, local governments and the private
sector.
e. Collaboration with the United States based on the Japan-U.S. Alliance
In all stages from peacetime to armed contingencies, in line with the
“Guidelines for Japan-U.S. Defense Cooperation,” Japan will effectively
conduct activities described in 2. by playing on its initiative its own roles in
the Japan-U.S. Alliance.
f. Promotion of security cooperation
SDF will actively engage in efforts for enhanced security cooperation as stated
in 3.: In accordance with policies that are tailored to individual regions and
countries, SDF will strategically promote defense cooperation and exchanges
such as: joint training and exercises, cooperation in defense equipment and
technologies, capacity building assistance, and service-to-service exchange.

2. Strengthening the Japan-U.S. Alliance
The Japan-U.S. Security Arrangements based on the Japan-U.S. Security
Treaty, together with Japan’s own national defense architecture, constitute
a cornerstone for Japan’s national security. The Japan-U.S. Alliance, with


-----

the Japan-U.S. Security Arrangements as its core, plays a significant role for
peace, stability and prosperity of not only Japan but also the Indo-Pacific
region and the international community.
As inter-sate competitions prominently emerge, it has become all the more
important for Japan’s national security to further strengthen relationship with
the United States, with whom Japan shares universal values and strategic
interests. The United States also views that cooperation with its allies has
become more important.
While the Japan-U.S. Alliance has been reinforced through activities
including those that were made possible by the Legislation for Peace and
Security, Japan needs to further enhance the Alliance through efforts under
the “Guidelines for Japan-US Defense Cooperation” in order to achieve
its national defense objective as security environment surrounding Japan
becomes more testing and uncertain at remarkably fast speeds.
In further strengthening the Japan-U.S. Alliance, it is an essential premise
that Japan strengthen its own defense capability on its own accord and
initiative. Fulfilling this premise, Japan needs to press ahead with efforts
such as: bolstering the ability of the Alliance to deter and counter threats;
enhancing and expanding cooperation in a wide range of areas; and steadily
implementing measures concerning the stationing of U.S. Forces in Japan.

(1) Strengthening ability of Japan-U.S. Alliance to deter and counter threats
In all stages from peacetime to armed contingencies as well as during
disasters, Japan will enhance information sharing with the United States,
conduct effective and smooth bilateral coordination involving all relevant
organizations and take all necessary measures to ensure Japan’s peace and
security.
For these purposes, Japan will further deepen various operational
cooperation and policy coordination with the United States. In particular,
Japan will expand and deepen cooperation in: space and cyber domains;
comprehensive air and missile defense; bilateral training and exercises;
bilateral ISR operations; and bilateral flexible deterrent options. Japan will
also promote formulation and renewal of bilateral plans and deepen the
Extended Deterrence Dialogue. In addition, Japan will even more actively
conduct activities such as logistic support for U.S. force activities and
protection of U.S. ships and aircraft.

(2) Strengthening and expanding cooperation in a wide range of areas
In order to create a desirable security environment including maintaining
and enhancing free and open maritime order, and with an eye on increasing
Japanese and U.S. presence in the Indo-Pacific region, Japan will conduct
bilateral activities such as capacity building assistance, humanitarian
assistance/disaster relief (HA/DR) and counter-piracy.
In order for Japan and the United States to be able to fully leverage
their capabilities during bilateral activities, Japan will enhance and expand
cooperation with the United States in such areas as equipment, technology,
facility, and intelligence as well as information security.
In particular, Japan will promote standardization of defense equipment
that contributes to Japan-U.S. bilateral activities, and sharing of various
networks. In order to support sustainable U.S. force activities around Japan as
well as to ensure high operational availability of SDF equipment, Japan will
build capacity for in-country maintenance of U.S.-made equipment.
To efficiently improve Japanese and U.S. capabilities, while facilitating
common understanding of respective priorities in defense capability
enhancement, promote measures such as effective acquisition of advanced
U.S equipment through optimized Foreign Military Sales (FMS) and JapanU.S. joint research and development.
With respect to SDF facilities and U.S force facilities and areas including
training facilities and areas, Japan will promote cooperation on joint/shared
use and efforts for improved resiliency.

(3) Steady implementation of measures concerning stationing of U.S. Forces in
Japan
Japan will provide stable support for smooth and effective stationing of U.S.
forces in Japan through various measures including Host Nation Support
(HNS). Japan will also steadily implement the realignment of U.S. forces in
Japan to mitigate impact on local communities while maintaining deterrence
provided by U.S. forces.
Okinawa is located in areas critically important to Japan’s national
security and U.S. force stationing in Okinawa greatly contributes to deterrent
the Japan-U.S. Alliance provides: At the same time, facilities and areas of U.S.
forces in Japan are highly concentrated in Okinawa. In light of this, Japan in
recent years has been furthering its efforts to mitigate impact on Okinawa
including returns of U.S. facilities and areas. Japan will continue to work
to mitigate impact on Okinawa by steadily implementing such measures as
realignment, consolidation and reduction of facilities and areas of U.S. forces
in Okinawa including the relocation of Marine Corps Air Station Futenma as
well as the dispersion of impact on Okinawa.

3. Strengthening security cooperation
In line with the vision of free and open Indo-Pacific, Japan will strategically
promote multifaceted and multilayered security cooperation, taking into
account characteristics and situation specific to each region and country. As


part of such efforts, Japan will actively leverage its defense capability to work
on defense cooperation and exchanges which include bilateral training and
exercises, defense equipment and technology cooperation, capacity building
assistance, and interchanges among military branches. Furthermore, Japan
will also contribute to address global security challenges. In implementing
these initiatives, Japan will position the Japan-U.S. Alliance as its cornerstone
and will work closely with the countries that share universal values and
security interests, through full coordination with its diplomatic policy.

(1) Promoting defense cooperation and exchanges
With Australia, to further improve interoperability and by utilizing
frameworks such as Foreign and Defense Ministerial Consultations (“2+2”),
Japan will further promote bilateral training and exercises and defense
equipment and technology cooperation, and advance cooperative activities
such as bilaterally-aligned capacity building assistance to third parties. Japan
will also strengthen cooperative relations under trilateral framework among
Japan, Australia and the United States, which share universal values and
strategic interests.
With India, in view of enhancing strategic partnership and by utilizing
frameworks such as “2+2,” Japan will promote bilateral training and exercises
and defense equipment and technology cooperation in a broad range of areas

in areas that Japan excels. Regarding SDF operation facility in the Republic
of Djibouti, which is used for anti-piracy efforts, Japan will work towards
stable, long-term use of the facility for regional security cooperation and other
activities.

**IV. Priorities in Strengthening Defense Capability**
1. Guiding thoughts
In order to adapt to increasingly rapid changes in security environment,
Japan must strengthen its defense capability at speeds that are fundamentally
different from the past. In view of aging population with declining birth rate
and severe fiscal situation, it is essential that Japan use budget and personnel
even more effectively.
In strengthening defense capability, Japan will enhance priority capability
areas as early as possible, allocating resources flexibly and intensively without
adhering to existing budget and human resource allocation, and undertake
necessary fundamental reforms.
In taking these measures, SDF will further promote jointness of the Ground,
Maritime and Air Self-Defense Forces in all areas and, avoiding stove-piped
approach, optimize their organizations and equipment. In particular, SDF
will further promote jointness in a wide range of areas such as capabilities
in new domains, which are space, cyberspace and electromagnetic spectrum,
comprehensive air and missile defense, damage recovery, transportation,
maintenance, supply, security, education, medical service and research.
With respect to hedging against invasion scenarios such as amphibious
landing employing large-scale ground forces, which were assumed primarily
during the Cold War period, SDF will retain forces only enough to maintain
and carry on the minimum necessary expertise and skills with which to adapt
to changes in situation in the future, and work further to achieve even greater
efficiency and rationalization.

2. Priorities in strengthening capabilities necessary for cross-domain operations
(1) Acquiring and strengthening capabilities in space, cyber and electromagnetic
domains
In order to realize cross-domain operations, SDF will acquire and strengthen
capabilities in new domains, which are space, cyberspace and electromagnetic
spectrum by focusing resources and leveraging Japan’s superb science and
technology. In doing so, SDF will strengthen and protect command, control,
communications and information capabilities that effectively connect
capabilities in all domains including the new ones.
a. Capabilities in space domain
Effective use of satellites for such purposes as information-gathering,
communication and positioning is essential for realizing cross-domain
operations. On the other hand, threats to the stable use of space are increasing.
SDF therefore will further improve various capabilities that leverage space
domain including information-gathering, communication and positioning
capabilities. SDF will also build a structure to conduct persistent ground- and
space-based space situation monitoring. To ensure superiority in use of space
at all stages from peacetime to armed contingencies, SDF will also work to
strengthen capabilities including mission assurance capability and capability
to disrupt opponent’s command, control, communications and information.
In so doing, SDF will actively leverage civilian technologies and work to
enhance cooperation with relevant agencies including the Japan Aerospace
Exploration Agency (JAXA) and with the United States and other relevant
countries. SDF will also engage in organization building such as the creation
of units specializing in space and dedicated career field, and develop human
resources and accumulate knowledge and expertise in the space field.
b. Capabilities in cyber domain
Information and communications networks that leverage cyberspace are a
foundation for SDF’s activities in various domains, and attack against them


seriously disrupts organized activities of SDF. In order to prevent such attack,
SDF will continue to strengthen capabilities for persistent monitoring of
command and communications systems and networks as well as for damage
limitation and recovery. In addition, SDF will fundamentally strengthen its
cyber defense capability, including capability to disrupt, during attack against
Japan, opponent’s use of cyberspace for the attack.
In so doing, SDF will significantly expand its human resources with
specialized expertise and skills, and take into consideration its contributions
to whole-of-government efforts.
c. Capabilities in electromagnetic domain
Since the use of electromagnetic spectrum has expanded in range and purpose,
it is now recognized as a major operational domain situated on the frontline
of offense-defense dynamic in today’s warfare. Ensuring superiority in
electromagnetic domain is also critical to realizing cross-domain operations.
SDF will work to enhance information and communications capabilities
as well as information collection and analysis capabilities related to
electromagnetics, and develop an information sharing posture. SDF will
improve capabilities to minimize the effect of opponent’s electronic
jamming. In addition, SDF will strengthen capabilities to neutralize radar
and communications of opponent who intends to invade Japan. In order to
smoothly perform these activities, SDF will enhance its ability to appropriately
manage and coordinate the use of electromagnetic spectrum.

(2) Enhancing capabilities in traditional domains
SDF will enhance capabilities to effectively counter attacks by aircraft, ships
and missiles during cross-domain operations in close combination with
capabilities in space, cyber and electromagnetic domains.
a. Capabilities in maritime and air domains
In order to effectively deal with armed attack against Japan, it is extremely
important for Japan to establish and maintain maritime and air superiority.
SDF will reinforce its posture for conducting persistent ISR at sea and in
the air around Japan.
SDF will also strengthen surface and underwater operational capabilities
including Unmanned Underwater Vehicles (UUV).
By taking measures such as developing a fighter force structure that
features Short Take-Off and Vertical Landing (STOVL) fighter aircraft
which bring operational flexibility, SDF will improve air operation capability
particularly on the Pacific side of Japan, where number of air bases is limited
despite its vast airspace. In so doing, as number of air bases that allow for
take-off and landing of fighters is limited, Japan will take necessary measures
to enable STOVL fighter aircraft to operate from existing SDF ships as
required, in order to further improve flexibility in fighter operations while
ensuring safety of SDF personnel.
b. Stand-off defense capability
As other countries make remarkable advances in early warning and control
capabilities and the performance of various missiles, SDF needs to effectively
intercept attack against Japan, while ensuring safety of its personnel.
SDF will acquire stand-off firepower and other requisite capabilities
to deal with ships and landing forces attempting to invade Japan including
remote islands from the outside of their threat envelopes. In addition, in
order to appropriately leverage advances in military technologies, Japan will
swiftly and flexibly strengthen stand-off defense capability through measures
such as comprehensive research and development of related technologies.
c. Comprehensive air and missile defense capability
Japan needs to effectively and efficiently counter increasingly diverse and
complex airborne threats of ballistic and cruise missiles and aircraft by
optimum means and minimize damage.
SDF will establish a structure with which to conduct integrated
operation of various equipment pieces, those for missile defense as well as
air defense equipment that each SDF service has separately used, thereby
providing persistent nation-wide protection and also enhancing capability to
simultaneously deal with multiple, complex airborne threats. SDF will also
study ways to counter future airborne threats.
Based on basic role and mission sharing between Japan and the United
States, in order to strengthen the deterrent of the Japan-U.S. Alliance as a
whole, Japan will continue to study a potential form of response capability
to address the means for missile launch and related facilities and will take
necessary measures.
d. Maneuver and deployment capability
In order to effectively deal with various situations such as attack on remote
islands, requisite SDF units need to conduct sustained, persistent activities
in appropriate areas on a steady-state basis and to maneuver and deploy
according to situation.
SDF will strengthen amphibious operation and other capabilities. In
addition, to enable swift and large-scale transport, SDF will strengthen joint
transport capability including inter- and intra-theater transport capabilities
tailored to the characteristics of remote island areas. SDF will also work to
collaborate with commercial transport on a steady-state basis.

(3) Strengthening sustainability and resiliency
To be able to sustain a range of requisite activities at all stages from peacetime
to armed contingencies, sustainability and resiliency of defense capability
including logistics support needs to be enhanced.


-----

SDF will take necessary measures for securing ammunition and fuel,
ensuring maritime shipping lanes, and protecting important infrastructure. In
particular, while cooperating with relevant ministries and agencies, SDF will
improve sustainability through safe and steady acquisition and stockpiling
of ammunition and fuel. SDF will also improve resiliency in a multilayered way through efforts including dispersion, recovery, and substitution
of infrastructure and other foundations for SDF operations. Further, SDF
will work toward more effective and efficient equipment maintenance by
reviewing existing maintenance methods, thereby ensuring high operational
availability.

3. Priorities in strengthening core elements of defense capability
(1) Reinforcing human resource base
The core element of defense capability is SDF personnel. Securing human
resources for SDF personnel and improving their ability and morale are
essential to strengthening defense capability. This has become an imminent
challenge in the face of shrinking and aging population with declining birth
rates. Also in light of sustainability and resilience of defense capability, SDF
needs to work even further to reinforce human resource base that sustains
SDF personnel.
MOD/SDF will promote efforts, including those address institutional
aspects, in order to secure diverse, high-quality talents from a wider range
of people. These efforts include: various recruitment measures such as
cooperation with local governments and other entities; diversifying applicant
pool including college graduates; expanding women’s participation;
appropriate extension of SDF personnel’s mandatory retirement ages;
leveraging retired SDF personnel as well as reserve personnel; and measures
for raising fulfillment rates. MOD/SDF will also promote manpower saving
and automation by leveraging technological innovations such as artificial
intelligence.
To enable all SDF personnel to maintain high morale and continue to fully
exercise their ability, MOD/SDF will improve living and work environment
and promote work style reforms at MOD/SDF to ensure proper work-life
balance.
Through such efforts as enhancing joint education and research, MOD/
SDF will enrich education and research to improve SDF’s capabilities
and foster its unity. MOD/SDF will enhance education for organization
management skills. In addition, MOD/SDF will improve treatment through
measures concerning honors and privileges, and allowance increase that
reflects the special nature of SDF’s missions. MOD/SDF will also further
improve re-employment support for SDF personnel in view of the fact that
it is the responsibility of the Government to secure the livelihood of SDF
personnel under the mandatory early retirement system.

(2) Reviewing equipment structure
MOD/SDF will examine the existing equipment structure from joint operation
perspective and build an optimized equipment structure. In so doing, while
giving due considerations to capabilities each SDF service requires for its
operations, MOD/SDF will: develop equipment with multiple functional
variants; optimize and standardize specifications of equipment; and jointly
procure equipment commonly used across SDF services; reduce types of
aircraft; suspend the use of equipment whose importance has decreased; and
review or discontinue projects of low cost-effectiveness.

(3) Reinforcing technology base
As character of warfare changes dramatically due to advances in military
technologies, it is becoming all the more important to reinforce technological
base that has bearing on defense equipment through whole-of-government
approach by leveraging Japan’s superb science and technology.
MOD/SDF will make focused investments through selection and
concentration in important technologies including artificial intelligence
and other potentially game- changing technologies. MOD/SDF will also
dramatically shorten research and development timelines by streamlining
R&D processes and procedures. In doing so, MOD/SDF will encourage
company’s prior investments and leverage its strength to full potential by
actively using design proposal-based competition scheme and improving
foreseeability through the formulation of R&D visions on capabilities
required for Japan’s future national defense.
In addition, MOD/SDF will work to actively leverage potentially dualuse, advanced commercial technologies through such efforts as: technology
exchange with relevant domestic and overseas entities; enhanced collaboration
with relevant ministries and agencies; and use of the “Innovative Science &
Technology Initiative for Security” program.
MOD/SDF will reinforce its structure aimed at early discovery of
innovative, emerging technologies and fostering thereof by utilizing and
creating think tanks that survey and analyze latest foreign and domestic
technological trends.

(4) Optimizing equipment procurement
In order to secure necessary and sufficient quality and quantity of SDF
equipment, MOD/SDF needs to acquire high-performance equipment at the
most affordable prices possible. MOD/SDF also needs to do thorough cost
management and reduction not only during budget development but also


during budget implementation.
MOD/SDF will actively use systematic acquisition methods including
long-term contracts which facilitate efficient procurement, and streamline
equipment maintenance. MOD/SDF will facilitate competition among
domestic and foreign companies, and promote defense equipment development
that eyes towards international joint development and production as well as
overseas transfer. In order to efficiently procure U.S.-made high-performance
equipment, MOD/SDF will promote rationalization of FMS procurement and
work to align procurement timings and specifications with U.S. forces and
other parties. In taking these steps, MOD/SDF will further strengthen efforts
on project management throughout the entire life cycle of defense equipment.

(5) Strengthening defense industrial base
Japan’s defense industry is an essential foundation for the production,
operation, and maintenance of defense equipment. For the production of highperformance equipment and to ensure their high operational availability, it
is necessary to make defense industrial base more resilient by overcoming
challenges such as high costs due to low- volume, high-mix production and
lack of international competitiveness, thereby enabling it to effectively adapt
to changing security environment.
In addition to taking various measures concerning equipment structure,
technological base, and equipment procurement, to create a competitive
environment for companies, MOD/SDF will reform the existing contract
system including affording incentives to companies. MOD/SDF will enhance
supply-chain risk management and work to further expand Japanese defense
industry’s participation in maintenance work of imported equipment. For
whole-of-government efforts to promote appropriate overseas transfer
of defense equipment under the Three Principles on Transfer of Defense
Equipment and Technology, which permits transfer of defense equipment
in cases where the transfer contributes to Japan’s security, MOD/SDF will
work to make necessary improvements in the Principles’ implementation. At
the same time, MOD/SDF will strengthen intellectual property management,
technology management and information security in order to prevent drain
of important defense equipment-related technologies. Through abovementioned measures, MOD/SDF will work to reduce equipment costs and
improve industrial competitiveness, thereby striving to build resilient defense
industrial base. MOD/SDF will also examine further measures to that end.

(6) Enhancing intelligence capabilities
MOD/SDF will enhance intelligence capabilities to provide timely, effective
intelligence support to policy decision and SDF operations. MOD/SDF will
strengthen capabilities for each stage of collection, processing, analysis,
sharing, and protection so that SDF can promptly detect and swiftly respond
to indications of various situations and also take requisite measures based on
medium- to long-term military trends.
In so doing, while giving due considerations to technological trends in
information processing, MOD/SDF will strengthen capability and posture,
including those related to new domains, for the collection of SIGINT, IMINT,
HUMINT, OSINT and others. MOD/SDF will enhance collaboration with
relevant domestic agencies including the Cabinet Satellite Intelligence Center
which operates Information Gathering Satellites and with the ally as well as
with other parties. MOD/SDF will work to hire, retain and train personnel for
information collection and analysis and to acquire and connect informationsharing systems. MOD/SDF also will establish more robust information
security regime and strengthen counter-intelligence capability.

**Reference 3 Medium Term Defense Program (FY 2019 - FY 2023)**

December 18, 2018
**I. Program Guidelines**
In the defense program for FY 2019 - FY 2023, with accordance to
“National Defense Program Guidelines for FY 2019 and beyond”
(approved by the National Security Council and Cabinet on December
18, 2018), Japan will significantly strengthen defense capability to build a
truly effective defense capability, “Multi- Domain Defense Force,” which:
organically fuses capabilities in all domains including space, cyberspace
and electromagnetic spectrum; and is capable of sustained conduct of
flexible and strategic activities during all phases from peacetime to armed
contingencies. The development of “Multi-Domain Defense Force” will
be done while honing the attributes of “Dynamic Joint Defense Force”
under the “National Defense Program Guidelines for FY 2014 and beyond”
(approved by the National Security Council and the Cabinet on December
17, 2013).
In order to adapt to increasingly rapid changes in security environment,
Japan will strengthen its defense capability at speeds that are fundamentally
different from the past. In view of aging population with declining birth
rate and severe fiscal situation Japan will strengthen its defense capability


-----

including logistics support will be enhanced.
2. In procuring equipment, by properly combining the introduction of new,
high- performance equipment, with life extension and improvement
of existing equipment, MOD/SDF will efficiently secure defense
capability in necessary and sufficient “quality” and “quantity”. In this
regard, MOD/SDF will strengthen its project management throughout
its equipment life-cycle, including during its research and development
activities, and reduce the life-cycle costs to improve cost-effectiveness.
Moreover, MOD/SDF will make focused investments through selection
and concentration in cutting-edge technologies. MOD/SDF will also
dramatically shorten research and development (R&D) timelines by
streamlining its processes and procedures.
3. In the face of rapidly shrinking and aging population with declining
birth rates, to ensure SDF’s strength, to strive to secure human resources
for SDF personnel and to improve their ability and morale, who are the
core element of defense capability, MOD/SDF will comprehensively
promote various measures to reinforce human resource base such
as securing diverse and high-quality talents including diversifying
applicant pool, promoting women’s participation and leveraging
reserve personnel, improving living and work environment, promoting
work style reforms, and improving treatment.
4. In order to maintain and strengthen the commitment of the United
States (U.S.) to Japan and the Indo-Pacific region and to secure Japan’s
security, and based on the premise that Japan will strengthen its own
capabilities, Japan will further promote a variety of cooperative
activities and consultations with the U.S., in a wide range of areas
under “Guidelines for Japan-U.S. Defense Cooperation”. Japan will
also actively facilitate measures for the smooth and effective stationing
of U.S. forces in Japan.
In line with the vision of free and open Indo-Pacific, to strategically
promote multifaceted and multilayered security cooperation, Japan will
actively leverage its defense capability to promote defense cooperation
and exchanges which include bilateral/multilateral training and
exercises, defense equipment and technology cooperation, capacity
building assistance, and interchanges among military branches.
5. With respect to hedging against invasion scenarios such as amphibious
landing employing large-scale ground forces, which were assumed
primarily during the Cold War period, SDF will retain forces only
enough to maintain and carry on the minimum necessary expertise
and skills with which to adapt to changes in situation in the future, by
achieving efficiency and rationalization.
6. Considering increasingly severe fiscal conditions and importance
of other budgets related to people’s daily life, MOD/SDF will work
to achieve greater efficiency and streamlining in defense force
development while harmonizing with other policies and measures of
the Government.

**II. Reorganization of the Major SDF Units**
1. In order to build a structure that is capable of realizing cross-domain
operations including new domains, which are space, cyberspace and
electromagnetic spectrum, SDF will strengthen the Joint Staff’s posture
designed for effective SDF operations and for new domains, thereby
enabling swift exercise of SDF’s capabilities. For the future framework
for joint operations, SDF will take necessary measures after considering
how to conduct the operation of organizations in which the functions in
the new domains are operated unitarily, and come to conclusions after
considering how the integrated structure should be during steady-state
to appropriately execute instructions from the Minister based on the
posture of the strengthened Joint Staff. SDF will also work to flexibly
leverage personnel of each SDF service through such efforts as building
posture for force protection and damage recovery with an eye on mutual
cooperation among SDF services.
SDF will establish 1 squadron of ASDF space domain mission unit
in order to conduct persistent monitoring of situations in space, and to
ensure superiority in use of space at all stages from peacetime to armed
contingencies.
SDF will establish 1 squadron of cyber defense unit as joint unit in
order to fundamentally strengthen cyber defense capabilities, including
capability to disrupt, in the event of attack against Japan, opponent’s use
of cyberspace for the attack as well as to conduct persistent monitoring
of SDF’s information and communications networks.
SDF will strengthen the Joint Staff’s posture in order to appropriately
manage and coordinate, from joint operation perspective, the use of
electromagnetic spectrum, and advance efforts to enhance defense
capability related to the use of electromagnetic spectrum in each SDF
service.
In order to provide persistent nation-wide protection on a steadystate basis and to be able to simultaneously deal with multiple, complex
airborne threats, GSDF will establish 2 squadrons of ballistic missile
defense (BMD) units. In addition, in order to operate units more
efficiently including command and control in accordance with the
enhancement of SDF’s ballistic missile response capabilities, ASDF
will reorganize surface-to-air guided missile units from 6 fire groups to


4 groups while maintaining 24 fire squadrons.
At all stages from peacetime to armed contingencies, SDF will
establish 1 group of maritime transportation unit as Joint Unit that
allows SDF units to swiftly maneuver and deploy in joint operations.
2. In order to strengthen operation capabilities in new domains, GSDF
will establish cyberspace units and electromagnetic operation units as
subordinate units of the Ground Component Command.
In order to respond swiftly, and to deter and counter effectively and
swiftly with various situations, GSDF will transform 1 division and
2 brigades respectively into 1 rapid deployment division and 2 rapid
deployment brigades that are furnished with advanced mobility and ISR
capabilities. In addition to rapid deployment divisions and brigades, an
amphibious rapid deployment brigade, which will be strengthened by
the establishment of 1 amphibious rapid deployment regiment, will
strengthen its ability to deter and counter threats through conducting
persistent steady-state maneuver such as coordinated activities with
ships as well as various training and exercises. In addition, through
continuing to establish area security units in charge of initial response
activities, MOD will newly establish surface-to-air guided missile
units and surface-to-ship guided missile units, GSDF will strengthen
its defense posture of the remote islands in the southwest region.
Furthermore, to counter invasion of remote islands, GSDF will take
necessary measures to establish hyper-velocity gliding projectile
(HVGP) units for the defense of remote islands.
From the perspective of enabling swift and flexible operations,
while thoroughly facilitating efficiency and rationalizing preparations
for invasion, such as the landing of large-scale ground forces, GSDF
will steadily implement programs towards successive formation of units
equipped with mobile combat vehicles and disuse of tanks deployed
in basic operational units stationed in locations other than Hokkaido
and Kyushu. In addition, GSDF will steadily carry out programs that
concentrate howitzers deployed in basic operational units stationed
in locations other than Hokkaido into newly organized field artillery
units under the direct command of the respective regional armies.
Furthermore, GSDF will reduce its combat helicopter units under the
direct command of the respective regional armies and consider the
review of their deployment to operate them effectively and efficiently.
3. In order to provide for defense in the waters around Japan and security
of maritime traffic through effective prosecution of persistent ISR,
anti-submarine operations and mine countermeasure operations,
to be able to effectively engage in security cooperation with other
countries, MSDF will maintain 4 groups mainly consisting of 1
helicopter destroyer (DDH) and 2 Aegis-equipped destroyers (DDG),
and maintain 2 groups consisting of new type of destroyers (FFM) with
improved multi- mission capabilities and minesweeping vessels. MSDF
will newly establish surface units composed of these destroyer units
and minesweeper units. In addition, MSDF will establish patrol vessel
units to enable enhanced steady-state ISR in the waters around Japan.
Furthermore, by introducing a test submarine, which the type will
be changed from an existing submarine, MSDF will work to achieve
greater efficiency in submarine operations and accelerate capability
improvement, thereby enhancing persistent ISR posture. In order to
effectively conduct underwater ISR and patrols and defense in the
waters around Japan, MSDF will continue to take measures necessary
to increase the number of submarines.
4. In order to enhance the air defense posture and operate effectively in
airspace around Japan including vast airspace on the Pacific side, ASDF
will reorganize 8 warning groups and 20 warning squadrons to 28
warning squadrons and establish 1 airborne early warning (AEW) wing
as part of air warning and control units, and take necessary measures to
establish 1 squadron of fighter aircraft units.
ASDF will disband 1 squadron of tactical reconnaissance unit with
the retirement of its reconnaissance aircraft (RF-4), and will establish
1 squadron of aerial refueling/transport units to enhance its aerial
refueling/transport function.
In order to be able to conduct information collection in areas
relatively remote from Japan and persistent airborne monitoring during
situations with heightened tensions, ASDF will establish 1 squadron of
unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) unit.
5. The total number of authorized GSDF personnel at the end of FY 2023
will be approximately 159,000, with approximately 151,000 being
active-duty personnel, and approximately 8,000 being reserve-ready
personnel. The authorized number of active- duty personnel of the
MSDF and ASDF through FY 2023 will be approximately at the same
levels as at the end of FY 2018.
During the period of the program, SDF will promote initiatives
to optimize organizations and missions such as reviewing the
existing organizations and missions whose importance has declined
and assigning personnel mainly to new domains, which are space,
cyberspace and electromagnetic spectrum.

other relevant countries, given that cutting-edge technology
and knowhow have been accumulated in these organizations.
(B) Capabilities in Cyber Domain
SDF aims to persistently ensure sufficient security against
cyber attack and acquire capability to disrupt, opponent’s
use of cyberspace in the event of attack against Japan. With
consideration to enhancing joint functions and efficient
resource allocations, SDF will establish the necessary
environment by such measures as expanding the structure
of cyber defense squadron and other units, enhancing the
resiliency of the C4 systems of SDF, strengthening capabilities
of information gathering, research and analysis, and developing
a practical training environment that can test SDF’s cyber
defense capability. In addition, SDF will strive to keep abreast
of the latest information including cyber-related risks, counter
measures and technological trends, through cooperation with
the private sector, and strategic talks, bilateral/multilateral
exercises and other opportunities with the ally and other
parties.
As the methods of cyber attack are becoming increasingly
sophisticated and complicated, securing personnel with
expertise on a continuing basis is essential. SDF plans to
develop personnel with strong cyber security expertise,
through efforts such as improving the in-house curriculum
for specialized education, increasing learning opportunities
at institutions of higher education at home and abroad, and
conducting personnel management that cultivates expertise. In
addition, SDF will strengthen the cyber defense capability by
utilizing superior outside expertise.
In order to enable a comprehensive response through a
whole-of-government approach in cyber domain, MOD/SDF
seeks to enhance close coordination with relevant ministries
and agencies, etc. by providing knowledge and MOD/SDF
personnel on a steady-state basis, and enhance training and
exercises.

SDF will proceed replacing fighters that are not suitable
for modernization (F-15) by increasing the number of
fighters (F-35A) and will newly introduce fighters that are
capable of short take-off and vertical landing (hereinafter
referred to as “STOVL aircraft”) to enhance the flexibility
of fighter operations, as the number of air bases that allow
for conventional take-off and landing of fighters is limited.
In this regard, SDF will refurbish MSDF’s multi-function
helicopter carrier destroyers (Izumo class) after studying
operation of STOVL aircraft so that the operation where
necessary will be possible such as response to air attacks
in time of emergency, ISR, training and disaster response,
in order to further improve flexibility in fighter operations
while ensuring safety of SDF personnel and to improve
air operation capability particularly on the Pacific side of
Japan, where number of air bases is limited despite its
vast airspace. These destroyers shall continue to engage
as multi-function destroyers in a wide range of missions
after refurbishment, such as the defense of Japan and the
response to large- scale disasters. There will be no change
in the existing Government opinion concerning equipment
that cannot be possessed under the Constitution. In addition,
SDF will upgrade the capabilities of modernized fighter
aircraft (F-15) including the enhancement of electronic
warfare capabilities, mounting stand-off missiles and
increasing the number of mounted missiles. Furthermore,
SDF will upgrade the capabilities of fighter aircraft (F-2)
including the enhancement of network functions.
With regard to future fighter, SDF will procure new
fighters that are capable of playing a central role in future
networked warfare before the retirement of the fighter
aircraft (F-2). MOD/SDF will promote necessary research

and Australia. France is participating in the initiative by European countries
and has announced its intention to establish a command in the UAE. India
is also carrying out activities using ships independently. In this manner, the
international community is making all-out efforts to ensure safety, while
gathering information for the safety of navigation by diverse means.
In this context, Japan has decided to make government-wide efforts
and implement comprehensive measures in collaboration among relevant
ministries and agencies with regard to the following points as Japan’s
independent initiative to ensure peace and stability in the Middle East and the
safety of Japan-related vessels: (1) further diplomatic efforts to ease tensions
in the Middle East and stabilize the situation; (2) thorough implementation
of navigation safety measures, including close information sharing with
relevant industries; and (3) better utilization of the SDF’s ships and aircraft to
strengthen information gathering posture. In light of the significance of these
measures, Japan will take actions as follows based on the Cabinet decision.
- 
**1. Further diplomatic efforts**
Japan has built good relations with countries involved in the stability of
the Middle East, such as maintaining good relations with Iran for many
years while being an ally of the United States. Taking advantage of these
relations, Japan will make further diplomatic efforts, including reaching
out to the countries concerned at various levels, to ease tensions and


**Reference 15 Government’s Efforts to Ensure the Safety of Japan-Related**
**Vessels in the Middle East**

(Approved by the National Security Council and the Cabinet on
December 27, 2019)


Peace and stability in the Middle East are crucial to the peace and prosperity of
the international community, including Japan. In addition, it is very important
to ensure the safety of Japan-related vessels (meaning Japanese-flag ships and
foreign-flag ships that Japanese nationals are on board, as well as foreignflag ships operated by Japanese shipping business operators or foreign-flag
ships transporting Japanese cargoes that are important for stable economic
activities of Japanese people; hereinafter the same) in the Middle East, which
is the world’s major energy source.
In the Middle East, amidst rising tensions, there were incidents of attacks
on ships. In June 2019, Japan-related vessels suffered damage. Under these
circumstances, each country is reinforcing measures to ensure the safety of
navigation in the region by utilizing ships and aircraft. Under the International
Maritime Security Construct, the United States is carrying out activities
utilizing ships, etc. together with such countries as the United Kingdom

stabilize the situation in the Middle East. In addition, Japan will continue
to seek cooperation from the coastal countries that play an important role
in the safe navigation of vessels. As for SDF’s activities in the Middle East
region, Japan has made efforts to gain the understanding of related countries
in the region. Continued efforts will be made to gain the understanding
of the countries concerned in the region regarding the SDF’s information
gathering activities described in 3 below.
**2. Thorough implementation of navigation safety measures**
Japan will thoroughly implement its navigation safety measures, including
meticulous information sharing with related industries. Specifically, a
system of cooperation within the government and between the government
and related industries will be established, which will also cover the sharing
of information obtained through the SDF’s information gathering activities
described in 3 below by related ministries and agencies. In addition,
whenever information that suggests the existence of a risk to the safe
navigation of vessels is obtained, the government will promptly share such
information with related industries to call for vigilance in a timely manner,
encouraging them to thoroughly implement navigation safety measures at
their own initiative.
**3. Information gathering activities by the SDF**
Although there is no immediate need to implement protective measures
for Japan-related vessels in the Middle East, given the rising tensions in
the region, it is necessary to strengthen the information gathering system
to ensure the safety of Japan-related vessels. Therefore, Japan has decided
to have the SDF conduct information gathering activities, considering the
distance from Japan to the Middle East region, the SDF’s experience in
operating in the region, and the importance of cooperation with units and
organizations from other countries.
The SDF’s information gathering activities are part of the government’s
navigation safety measures and are aimed at collecting information
necessary to ensure the safety of Japan-related vessels. The activities are
to be conducted in accordance with the provisions of Article 4, paragraph
(1), item (xviii) of the Act for Establishment of the Ministry of Defense
(Act No. 164 of 1954), as they would need smooth decision making and
order issuance in relation to Maritime Security Operations as measures
for unforeseen circumstances or other changes in the situation, which are
provided in Article 82 of the Self-Defense Forces Law (Act No. 165 of
1954) described in (4) below.
Basic implementation policies are as follows. Details are to be provided
in the Defense Minister’s order.
(1) Information to Be Gathered
The SDF will gather information that directly affects or is necessary for
ensuring safe navigation in the waters described in (3) below.
(2) Equipment
After necessary adjustments, one destroyer will be newly dispatched.
In addition, the SDF will also use fixed-wing patrol aircraft P-3C of the
units currently engaged in the Counter-Piracy Operations (hereinafter
referred to as “counter-piracy units”) under Article 7, paragraph (1)
of the Acts of Punishment and Countermeasures against Piracy (Act
No. 55 of 2009, hereinafter referred to as the “Piracy Countermeasures
Act”). Information gathering activities by the counter-piracy units will
be carried out to an extent that does not interfere with the counter-piracy
operation.
(3) Geographical Scope of Activities
The geographical scope of the information gathering activities by
destroyers and fixed-wing patrol aircraft described in (2) consists of
three waters of high seas: the Gulf of Oman, the northern Arabian Sea,
and the Gulf of Aden to the east of the Bab el-Mandeb Strait (including
the exclusive economic zones of the coastal states). For resupply,
destroyers will call at a port facing the three seas.
(4) Responding to Unforeseen Circumstances or Other Changes in the
Situation
In the event of unforeseen circumstances or other changes in the
situation, the relevant ministries and agencies will work together to
understand the situation, share information closely and promptly with
each other, and strengthen the government’s response. Then, if further
measures by the SDF are deemed necessary in response to the situation
in question, Maritime Security Operations will be ordered in accordance
with Article 82 of the Self-Defense Forces Law. When issuing such an
order, the MOD will make best efforts for prompt decision making.
The measures that can be taken in the course of Maritime Security
Operations will be based on international laws, including the flag
state principle, and will vary depending on the circumstances, such as
whether the protected vessel is a Japanese or foreign-flagged vessel and
the type of infringement.
(5) Ensuring the Safety of the SDF Units
In conducting information gathering activities, the SDF units take all
possible measures to ensure their own safety, including the collection
of sufficient information on the situation in the areas of operation, the
installation of equipment necessary to ensure safety, and appropriate
prior education and training
(6) Cooperation among Relevant Ministries and Agencies
In order to ensure the effectiveness of information gathering activities


and responses to changes in the situation including the rise of unforeseen
circumstances, relevant ministries and agencies will work closely
together to share understanding regarding such responses, improve
response capabilities through training, and develop a system that allows
for a prompt response to the situation.
(7) Cooperation with Other Countries
Although Japan does not participate in any specific framework related
to the safety of navigation in the Middle East and the SDF’s information
gathering activities are to be conducted at its own initiative, Japan will
communicate and cooperate with other countries as necessary.
(8) Duration of the SDF’s Activities
The period during which the SDF should engage in the information
gathering activities (including preparation and training periods) under
the Cabinet decision is from December 27, 2019, to December 26,
2020. If it is deemed necessary to extend the SDF’s activities based on
the Cabinet decision, another Cabinet decision or any changes to it will
be made in that regard. If, prior to the expiration of the above period, the
SDF’s activities are no longer deemed necessary in light of the necessity
described in this paragraph, the SDF will terminate such activities at
that point. If there is a noticeable change in the situation, the National
Security Council will consider a response.
**4. Report to the Diet**
In view of the fact that matters pertaining to the SDF operations under the

**Reference 16 United States-Japan Roadmap for Realignment**
**Implementation (tentative translation)**


(Washington, DC, May 1, 2006)
**Overview**
On October 29, 2005, the U.S.–Japan Security Consultative Committee
(SCC) members approved recommendations for realignment of U.S. forces in
Japan and related Japan Self-Defense Forces (SDF) in their document, “U.S.–
Japan Alliance: Transformation and Realignment for the Future.” In that
document, the SCC members directed their respective staffs “to finalize these
specific and interrelated initiatives and develop plans, including concrete
implementation schedules no later than March 2006.” This work has been
completed and is reflected in this document.
**Finalization of Realignment Initiatives**
The individual realignment initiatives form a coherent package. When
implemented, these realignments will ensure a life-of-the-alliance presence
for U.S. forces in Japan.
The construction and other costs for facility development in the
implementation of these initiatives will be borne by the Government of Japan
(GOJ) unless otherwise specified. The U.S. Government (USG) will bear
the operational costs that arise from implementation of these initiatives. The
two Governments will finance their realignment associated costs consistent
with their commitments in the October 29, 2005 SCC document to maintain
deterrence and capabilities while reducing burdens on local communities.
**Key Implementation Details**
1. Realignment on Okinawa
(a) Futenma Replacement Facility (FRF)
 The United States and Japan will locate the FRF in a configuration
that combines the Henoko-saki and adjacent water areas of Oura
and Henoko Bays, including two runways aligned in a “V”-shape,
each runway having a length of 1,600 meters plus two 100-meter
overruns. The length of each runway portion of the facility is 1,800
meters, exclusive of seawalls (see attached concept plan dated April
28, 2006). This facility ensures agreed operational capabilities while
addressing issues of safety, noise, and environmental impacts.
 In order to locate the FRF, inclusive of agreed support facilities, in
the Camp Schwab area, necessary adjustments will be made, such
as reconfiguration of Camp Schwab facilities and adjacent water
surface areas.
 Construction of the FRF is targeted for completion by 2014.
 Relocation to the FRF will occur when the facility is fully
operationally capable.
 Facility improvements for contingency use at ASDF bases at
Nyutabaru and Tsuiki related to replacement of Marine Corps Air
Station (MCAS) Futenma capabilities will be made, as necessary,
after conducting site surveys and before MCAS Futenma is
returned.
 Requirements for improved contingency use of civilian facilities
will be examined in the context of bilateral contingency planning,
and appropriate arrangements will be made in order to realize the
return of MCAS Futenma.
 In principle the construction method for the FRF will be landfill


-----

 The USG does not intend to operate fighter aircraft from this
facility.
(b) Force Reductions and Relocation to Guam
 Approximately 8,000 III Marine Expeditionary Force (MEF)
personnel and their approximately 9,000 dependents will relocate
from Okinawa to Guam by 2014, in a manner that maintains unit
integrity. Units to relocate will include: III MEF Command Element,
3rd Marine Division Headquarters, 3rd Marine Logistics Group
(formerly known as Force Service Support Group) Headquarters,
1st Marine Air Wing Headquarters, and 12th Marine Regiment
Headquarters.
 The affected units will relocate from such facilities as Camp
Courtney, Camp Hansen, MCAS Futenma, Camp Zukeran, and
Makiminato Service Area.
 The U.S. Marine Corps (USMC) forces remaining on Okinawa
will consist of Marine Air-Ground Task Force elements, such as
command, ground, aviation, and combat service support, as well as
a base support capability.
 Of the estimated $10.27 billion cost of the facilities and
infrastructure development costs for the III MEF relocation to
Guam, Japan will provide $6.09 billion (in U.S. FY2008 dollars),
including $2.8 billion in direct cash contributions, to develop
facilities and infrastructure on Guam to enable the III MEF
relocation, recognizing the strong desire of Okinawa residents that
such force relocation be realized rapidly. The United States will
fund the remainder of the facilities and infrastructure development
costs for the relocation to Guam estimated in U.S. FY2008 dollars
at $3.18 billion in fiscal spending plus approximately $1 billion for
a road.
(c) Land Returns and Shared Use of Facilities
 Following the relocation to the FRF, the return of MCAS Futenma,
and the transfer of III MEF personnel to Guam, the remaining
facilities and areas on Okinawa will be consolidated, thereby
enabling the return of significant land areas south of Kadena Air
Base.
 Both sides will develop a detailed consolidation plan by March
2007. In this plan, total or partial return of the following six
candidate facilities will be examined:
 Camp Kuwae: Total return.
 Camp Zukeran: Partial return and consolidation of remaining
facilities and infrastructure to the extent possible.
 MCAS Futenma: Total return (see FRF section above).
 Makiminato Service Area: Total return.
 aha Port: Total return (relocated to the new facilities, including
additional staging constructed at Urasoe).
 Army POL Depot Kuwae Tank Farm No. 1: Total return.
 All functions and capabilities that are resident in facilities
designated for return, and that are required by forces remaining in
Okinawa, will be relocated within Okinawa. These relocations will
occur before the return of designated facilities.
 While emphasizing the importance of steady implementation of the
recommendations of the Special Action Committee on Okinawa
(SACO) Final Report, the SACO relocation and return initiatives
may need to be reevaluated.
 Camp Hansen will be used for GSDF training. Shared use that
requires no facility improvements will be possible from 2006.
 ASDF will use Kadena Air Base for bilateral training with U.S.
forces, taking into account noise impacts on local communities.
(d) Relationships among Initiatives
 Within the overall package, the Okinawa-related realignment
initiatives are interconnected.
 Specifically, consolidation and land returns south of Kadena depend
on completing the relocation of III MEF personnel and dependents
from Okinawa to Guam.
 The III MEF relocation from Okinawa to Guam is dependent on:
(1) tangible progress toward completion of the FRF, and (2) Japan’s
financial contributions to fund development of required facilities
and infrastructure on Guam.
2. Improvement of U.S. Army Command and Control Capability
 U.S. Army command and control structure at Camp Zama will be
transformed by U.S. FY2008. The headquarters of the GSDF Central
Readiness Force subsequently will arrive at Camp Zama by Japan
FY2012; SDF helicopters will have access to Kastner Heliport on Camp
Zama.
 Along with the transformation of Army headquarters in Japan, a battle
command training center and other support facilities will be constructed
within Sagami General Depot (SGD) using U.S. funding.
 In relation to this transformation, the following measures for efficient
and effective use of Camp Zama and SGD will be implemented.
 Some portions of land at SGD will be returned for local
redevelopment (approximately 15 hectares (ha)) and for road and
underground rail (approximately 2ha). Affected housing units will
be relocated to Sagamihara Housing Area.


 A specified area of open space in the northwest section of SGD
(approximately 35ha) will be provided for local use when not
required for contingency or training purposes.
 Portions of the Chapel Hill housing area of Camp Zama (1.1ha)
will be returned to the GOJ following relocation of affected housing
units within Camp Zama. Further discussions on possible additional
land returns at Chapel Hill will occur as appropriate.
3. Yokota Air Base and Airspace
 ASDF Air Defense Command (ADC) and relevant units will relocate
to Yokota Air Base in Japan FY2010. A bilateral master plan for base
use will be developed to accommodate facility and infrastructure
requirements.
 A bilateral, joint operations coordination center (BJOCC), established
at Yokota Air Base, will include a collocated air and missile defense
coordination function. The USG and GOJ will fund their own required
equipment and systems, respectively, while both sides will coordinate
appropriate funding of shared use equipment and systems.
 The following measures will be pursued to facilitate movement of
civilian aircraft through Yokota airspace while satisfying military
operational requirements.
 Establish a program in Japan FY2006 to inform commercial
aviation entities of existing procedures to transit Yokota airspace.
 Return portions of Yokota airspace to Japanese control by
September 2008; specific portions will be identified by October
2006.
 Develop procedures in Japan FY2006 for temporary transfers of air
traffic control responsibility to Japanese authorities for portions of
Yokota airspace, when not required for military purposes.
 Study the conditions required for the possible return of the entire
Yokota airspace as part of a comprehensive study of options for
related airspace reconfigurations and changes in air traffic control
procedures that would satisfy future patterns of civilian and military
(U.S. and Japanese) demand for use of Japanese airspace. The study
will take into account both the lessons learned from the Kadena
radar approach control (RAPCON) transfer experience and the
lessons learned from experiences with collocation of U.S. forces
and Japanese controllers in Japan. This study will be completed in
Japan FY2009.
 The USG and GOJ will conduct a study of the specific conditions and
modalities for possible civilian-military dual use of Yokota Air Base, to
be completed within 12 months from commencement.
 The study will be conducted on the shared understanding that dualuse must not compromise military operations and safety or the
military operational capabilities of Yokota Air Base.
 Based upon the outcome of this study, the two governments will
consult and then make appropriate decisions on civilian- military
dual-use.
4. Relocation of Carrier Air Wing from Atsugi Air Facility to Marine Corps
Air Station (MCAS) Iwakuni
 The relocation of Carrier Air Wing Five (CVW-5) squadrons from
Atsugi Air Facility to MCAS Iwakuni, consisting of F/A-18, EA-6B,
E-2C, and C-2 aircraft, will be completed by 2014, subsequent to the
following: (1) completion of necessary facilities, and (2) adjustment of
training airspace and the Iwakuni RAPCON airspace.
 Necessary facilities will be developed at Atsugi Air Facility to
accommodate MSDF E/O/UP-3 squadrons and other aircraft from
Iwakuni, taking into account the continued requirement for U.S.
operations from Atsugi.
 The KC-130 squadron will be based at MCAS Iwakuni with its
headquarters, maintenance support facilities, and family support
facilities. The aircraft will regularly deploy on a rotational basis
for training and operations to MSDF Kanoya Base and Guam. To
support the deployment of KC-l30 aircraft, necessary facilities will be
developed at Kanoya.
 U.S. Marine Corps CH-53D helicopters will be relocated from MCAS
Iwakuni to Guam when the III MEF personnel relocate from Okinawa
to Guam.
 Training airspace and Iwakuni RAPCON airspace will be adjusted to
fulfill safely the training and operational requirements of U.S. forces,
Japan SDF, and commercial aircraft (including those in neighboring
airspace) through coordination by the Joint Committee.
 A bilateral framework to conduct a study on a permanent fieldcarrier
landing practice facility will be established, with the goal of selecting a
permanent site by July 2009 or the earliest possible date thereafter.
 Portions of the future civilian air facility will be accommodated at
MCAS Iwakuni.
5. Missile Defense
 As both sides deploy additional capabilities and improve their respective
ballistic missile defense capabilities, close coordination will continue.
 The optimum site for deployment of a new U.S. X-Band radar system
has been designated as ASDF Shariki Base. Necessary arrangements
and facility modifications, funded by the USG, will be made before the
radar becomes operational in summer 2006.


-----

 The USG will share X-Band radar data with the GOJ.
 U.S. Patriot PAC-3 capabilities will be deployed to Japan within
existing U.S. facilities and areas, becoming operational at the earliest
possible time.
6. Training Relocation
 Both sides will develop annual bilateral training plans beginning in
Japan FY2007. As necessary, a supplemental plan for Japan FY2006
can be developed.
 Initially, aircraft from three U.S. facilities— Kadena, Misawa, and
Iwakuni — will participate in relocated training conducted from the
following SDF facilities: Chitose, Misawa, Hyakuri, Komatsu, Tsuiki,
and Nyutabaru. Both sides will work toward expanding use of SDF
facilities for bilateral training and exercises in the future.
 The GOJ will improve infrastructure for training relocation at SDF
facilities as necessary after conducting site surveys.
 Relocated training will not diminish the quality of training that is
currently available to U.S. forces in Japan, taking into account facilities
and training requirements.
 In general, bilateral training will commence with participation of
1–5 aircraft for the duration of 1–7 days, and develop over time to
participation of 6–12 aircraft for 8–14 days at a time.
 At those SDF facilities at which terms of joint use are stipulated by
Joint Committee agreements, limitations on the number of joint training
events will be removed. Limitations on the total days and period per
training event for joint use of each SDF facility will be maintained.
 The USG and GOJ will share costs for bilateral training as appropriate,
bearing in mind the priority of maintaining readiness.

**Reference 18 The Guidelines for Japan-U.S. Defense Cooperation**


(April 27, 2015)
**I. Defense Cooperation and the Aim of the Guidelines**
In order to ensure Japan’s peace and security under any circumstances,
from peacetime to contingencies, and to promote a stable, peaceful, and
prosperous Asia-Pacific region and beyond, bilateral security and defense
cooperation will emphasize:

-  seamless, robust, flexible, and effective bilateral responses;

-  synergy across the two governments’ national security policies;

-  a whole-of-government Alliance approach;

-  cooperation with regional and other partners, as well as international
organizations; and

-  the global nature of the Japan-U.S. Alliance.
The two governments will continuously enhance the Japan-U.S.
Alliance. Each government will maintain its individual defense posture
based on its national security policy. Japan will possess defense capability
on the basis of the “National Security Strategy” and the “National Defense
Program Guidelines.” The United States will continue to extend deterrence
to Japan through the full range of capabilities, including U.S. nuclear
forces. The United States also will continue to forward deploy combatready forces in the Asia-Pacific region and maintain the ability to reinforce
those forces rapidly.
The Guidelines for Japan-U.S. Defense Cooperation (“the Guidelines”)
provide the general framework and policy direction for the roles and
missions of Japan and the United States, as well as ways of cooperation
and coordination, with a view to improving the effectiveness of bilateral
security and defense cooperation. In this way, the Guidelines advance
peace and security, deter conflict, secure the basis for economic prosperity,
and promote domestic and international understanding of the significance
of the Japan-U.S. Alliance.
**II. Basic Premises and Principles**
The Guidelines, as well as actions and activities under the Guidelines, are
and will be consistent with the following basic premises and principles.
A. The rights and obligations under the Treaty of Mutual Cooperation
and Security between Japan and the United States of America (the
Japan-U.S. Security Treaty) and its related arrangements, as well as
the fundamental framework of the Japan-U.S. Alliance, will remain
unchanged.
B. All actions and activities undertaken by Japan and the United States
under the Guidelines will be consistent with international law, including
the Charter of the United Nations and its provisions regarding the
peaceful settlement of disputes and sovereign equality of States, as well
as other relevant international agreements.
C. All actions and activities undertaken by Japan and the United States
will be in accordance with their respective constitutions, laws, and
regulations then in effect, and basic positions on national security
policy. Japan will conduct actions and activities in accordance with
its basic positions, such as the maintenance of its exclusively national
defense-oriented policy and its three non-nuclear principles.
D. The Guidelines do not obligate either government to take legislative,
budgetary, administrative, or other measures, nor do the Guidelines
create legal rights or obligations for either government. Since the
objective of the Guidelines, however, is to establish an effective
framework for bilateral cooperation, the two governments are expected
to reflect in an appropriate way the results of these efforts, based on
their own judgment, in their specific policies and measures.
**III. Strengthened Alliance Coordination**
Effective bilateral cooperation under the Guidelines will require the two
governments to conduct close, consultative dialogue and sound policy and
operational coordination from peacetime to contingencies.
The two governments must be well informed and coordinate at multiple
levels to ensure successful bilateral security and defense cooperation. To

that end, the two governments will take advantage of all available channels
to enhance information sharing and to ensure seamless and effective wholeof-government Alliance coordination that includes all relevant agencies.
For this purpose, the two governments will establish a new, standing
Alliance Coordination Mechanism, enhance operational coordination, and
strengthen bilateral planning.
A. Alliance Coordination Mechanism
Persistent and emerging threats can have a serious and immediate
impact on the peace and security of Japan and the United States. In
order to address seamlessly and effectively any situation that affects
Japan’s peace and security or any other situation that may require
an Alliance response, the two governments will utilize the Alliance
Coordination Mechanism. This mechanism will strengthen policy and
operational coordination related to activities conducted by the SelfDefense Forces and the United States Armed Forces in all phases from
peacetime to contingencies. This mechanism also will contribute to
timely information sharing as well as the development and maintenance
of common situational awareness. To ensure effective coordination, the
two governments will establish necessary procedures and infrastructure
(including facilities as well as information and communication systems)
and conduct regular training and exercises.
The two governments will tailor to the situation the procedures for
coordination as well as the exact composition of participating agencies
within the Alliance Coordination Mechanism structure. As part of these
procedures, contact information will be shared and maintained from
peacetime.
B. Enhanced Operational Coordination
Enhanced bilateral operational coordination for flexible and responsive
command and control is a core capability of critical importance to Japan
and the United States. In this context, the two governments recognize
the continued importance of collocating operational coordination
functions to strengthen cooperation between the Self-Defense Forces
and the United States Armed Forces.
The Self-Defense Forces and the United States Armed Forces
will exchange personnel to ensure robust information sharing, to
facilitate coordination from peacetime to contingencies, and to support
international activities. The Self-Defense Forces and the United States
Armed Forces, in close cooperation and coordination, will take action
through their respective chains-of-command.
C. Bilateral Planning
The two governments will continue to develop and update bilateral plans
to ensure smooth and effective execution of coordinated operations by
the Self-Defense Forces and the United States Armed Forces. To ensure
the effectiveness of the plans and the ability to make flexible, timely,
and appropriate responses, the two governments will exchange relevant
information, including identifying operational and logistic support
requirements and sources in advance, as appropriate.
The two governments will conduct bilateral planning in peacetime
for contingencies relevant to Japan’s peace and security through an
upgraded Bilateral Planning Mechanism, which includes relevant
agencies of the respective governments. Bilateral plans will be
developed with input from relevant agencies, as appropriate. The
Security Consultative Committee (SCC) will continue to be responsible
for presenting directions, validating the progress of the planning under
the mechanism, and issuing directives as necessary. The SCC will be
assisted by an appropriate subordinate body.
Bilateral plans are to be reflected appropriately in the plans of both
governments.
**IV. Seamlessly Ensuring Japan’s Peace and Security**
Persistent and emerging threats can have a serious and immediate
impact on Japan’s peace and security. In this increasingly complex
security environment, the two governments will take measures to ensure
Japan’s peace and security in all phases, seamlessly, from peacetime to
contingencies, including situations when an armed attack against Japan
is not involved. In this context, the two governments also will promote
further cooperation with partners.
The two governments recognize that these measures need to be taken
based on flexible, timely, and effective bilateral coordination tailored to
each situation and that interagency coordination is essential for appropriate
Alliance responses. Therefore, the two governments will utilize the wholeof-government Alliance Coordination Mechanism, as appropriate, to:

-  assess the situation;

-  share information; and

-  develop ways to implement the appropriate Alliance response, including
flexible deterrent options, as well as actions aimed at de-escalation.
To support these bilateral efforts, the two governments also will
coordinate strategic messaging through appropriate channels on issues that
could potentially affect Japan’s peace and security.
A. Cooperative Measures from Peacetime
In order to ensure the maintenance of Japan’s peace and security,  the
two governments will promote cooperation across a wide range of
areas, including through diplomatic efforts, to strengthen the deterrence
and capabilities of the Japan-U.S. Alliance.


The Self-Defense Forces and the United States Armed Forces
will enhance interoperability, readiness, and vigilance to prepare for
all possible situations. To these ends, the two governments will take
measures, including, but not limited to, the following:
1. Intelligence, Surveillance, and Reconnaissance
In order to identify at the earliest possible stage any indications
of threats to Japan’s peace and security and to ensure a decisive
advantage in intelligence gathering and analysis, the two
governments will share and protect information and intelligence,
while developing and maintaining common situational awareness.
This will include enhancing coordination and cooperation among
relevant agencies.
The Self-Defense Forces and the United States Armed Forces
will conduct intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance (ISR)
activities based on the capabilities and availability of their respective
assets. This will include conducting bilateral ISR activities in
a mutually supportive manner to ensure persistent coverage of
developments that could affect Japan’s peace and security.
2. Air and Missile Defense
The Self-Defense Forces and the United States Armed Forces will
maintain and strengthen deterrence and their defense postures
against ballistic missile launches and aerial incursions. The two
governments will cooperate to expand early warning capabilities,
interoperability, network coverage, and real-time information
exchange and to pursue the comprehensive improvement of
capabilities to respond to the threat of ballistic missiles. Moreover,
the two governments will continue to coordinate closely in
responding to provocative missile launches and other aerial
activities.
3. Maritime Security
The two governments will cooperate closely with each other on
measures to maintain maritime order based upon international law,
including freedom of navigation. The Self-Defense Forces and
the United States Armed Forces will cooperate, as appropriate, on
various efforts such as maintaining and enhancing bilateral presence
in the maritime domain through ISR and training and exercises,
while further developing and enhancing shared maritime domain
awareness including by coordinating with relevant agencies, as
necessary.
4. Asset Protection
The Self-Defense Forces and the United States Armed Forces will
provide mutual protection of each other’s assets, as appropriate, if
engaged in activities that contribute to the defense of Japan in a
cooperative manner, including during training and exercises.
5. Training and Exercises
The Self-Defense Forces and the United States Armed Forces
will conduct effective bilateral and multilateral training and
exercises both inside and outside of Japan in order to strengthen
interoperability, sustainability, and readiness. Timely and realistic
training and exercises will enhance deterrence. To support these
activities, the two governments will cooperate to ensure that
training areas, facilities, and associated equipment are available,
accessible, and modern.
6. Logistic Support
Japan and the United States are primarily responsible for providing
logistic support for their respective forces in all phases. The SelfDefense Forces and the United States Armed Forces will provide
mutual logistic support where appropriate, including, but not
limited to, supply, maintenance, transportation, engineering, and
medical services, for such activities as set forth in the Agreement
between the Government of Japan and the Government of the
United States of America Concerning Reciprocal Provision of
Logistic Support, Supplies and Services between the Self-Defense
Forces of Japan and the Armed Forces of the United States of
America (the Acquisition and Cross-Servicing Agreement) and its
related arrangements.
7. Use of Facilities
In order to expand interoperability and improve flexibility and
resiliency of the Self-Defense Forces and the United States
Armed Forces, the two governments will enhance joint/shared
use and cooperate in ensuring the security of facilities and areas.
Recognizing the importance of being prepared for contingencies,
the two governments also will cooperate in conducting site surveys
on facilities including civilian airports and seaports, as appropriate.
B. Responses to Emerging Threats to Japan’s Peace and Security
The Alliance will respond to situations that will have an important
influence on Japan’s peace and security. Such situations cannot
be defined geographically. The measures described in this section
include those that may be taken, in accordance with the two countries’
respective laws and regulations, in circumstances that have not yet
amounted to such a situation. Early recognition and adaptable, resolute
decision-making on bilateral actions will contribute to deterrence and
de-escalation of such situations.


-----

In addition to continuing cooperative measures from peacetime,
the two governments will pursue all avenues, including diplomatic
efforts, to ensure the peace and security of Japan. Utilizing the Alliance
Coordination Mechanism, the two governments will take additional
measures, based on their own decisions, including, but not limited to,
those listed below.
1. Noncombatant Evacuation Operations
When Japanese and U.S. noncombatants need to be evacuated from
a third country to a safe haven, each government is responsible for
evacuating its own nationals, as well as dealing with the authorities
of the affected area. As appropriate, the two governments will
coordinate in planning and cooperate in carrying out evacuations
of Japanese or U.S. noncombatants. These evacuations will be
carried out using each country’s capabilities such as transportation
means and facilities in a mutually supplementary manner. The two
governments may each consider extending evacuation assistance to
third-country noncombatants.
The two governments will conduct early-stage coordination
through the Alliance Coordination Mechanism, as appropriate,
to carry out cooperation in fields such as the safety of evacuees,
transportation means and facilities, customs, immigration and
quarantine processing, safe havens, and medical services. The
two governments will enhance coordination in noncombatant
evacuation operations from peacetime, as appropriate, including by
conducting training and exercises.
2. Maritime Security
Taking into account their respective capabilities, the two governments
will cooperate closely to enhance maritime security. Cooperative
measures may include, but are not limited to, information sharing
and inspection of ships based on a United Nations Security Council
resolution or other basis under international law.
3. Measures to Deal with Refugees
If a situation develops such that a flow of refugees into Japan
becomes likely or actually begins, the two governments will
cooperate to maintain Japan’s peace and security while handling
refugees in a humane manner consistent with applicable obligations
under international law. Primary responsibility for such refugee
response lies with Japan. The United States will provide appropriate
support upon a request from Japan.
4. Search and Rescue
The two governments will cooperate and provide mutual support,
as appropriate, in search and rescue operations. The Self-Defense
Forces, in cooperation with relevant agencies, will provide support
to combat search and rescue operations by the United States, where
appropriate, subject to Japanese laws and regulations.
5. Protection of Facilities and Areas
The Self-Defense Forces and the United States Armed Forces
are responsible for protecting their own facilities and areas in
cooperation with relevant authorities. Upon request from the
United States, Japan will provide additional protection for facilities
and areas in Japan in close cooperation and coordination with the
United States Armed Forces.
6. Logistic Support
The two governments will enhance mutual logistic support (which

peace, security, and prosperity in the Indo-Pacific region and remains ironclad amid an increasingly complex security environment. The Alliance will
continue to play an indispensable role in upholding a rules-based international
order and promoting the shared values of the American and Japanese people.
The Ministers welcomed the alignment of the strategic policy documents
of both countries, namely the United States’ National Security Strategy
and National Defense Strategy, and Japan’s National Defense Program
Guidelines. These strategies show that the U.S.-Japan security partnership
continues to adapt to be stronger, more advanced, and more effective,
consistent with the objectives of the bilateral 2015 Guidelines for U.S.-Japan
Defense Cooperation.
The Ministers acknowledged their shared concern that geopolitical
competition and coercive attempts to undermine international rules, norms,
and institutions present challenges to the Alliance and to the shared vision
of a free and open Indo-Pacific. The Ministers highlighted the need for an
increasingly networked structure of alliances and partnerships, anchored
by the U.S.-Japan Alliance, to counter these challenges. The Ministers also
expressed concern about rapidly evolving technological advancement in new
domains, including space, cyberspace, and the electromagnetic spectrum. The
Ministers highlighted the need to address these challenges jointly to ensure
the Alliance’s superiority in a contingency and to safeguard our institutions
and rules-based order during peacetime.
The Ministers affirmed that their two nations’ strong bilateral security
relationship continues to be the foundation of the U.S.-Japan Alliance. As
such, the Ministers decided that cooperation in cross- domain operations,
enhancing the Alliance’s capabilities, and increasing operational readiness
and cooperation should be core objectives to advance our defense relationship.
The United States welcomed Japan’s proactive steps to strengthen its
defensive capabilities, with the Ministers confirming that both nations need to
constantly re-evaluate their roles, missions, and capabilities.
Acknowledging the changing dynamics of warfare, the Ministers
highlighted the importance of developing capabilities and increasing
operational cooperation in both conventional and non- conventional domains.
The Ministers highlighted space, cyberspace, and the electromagnetic
spectrum as priority areas to better prepare the Alliance for cross-domain
operations.
On cyberspace issues, the Ministers recognized that malicious cyber
activity presents an increasing threat to the security and prosperity of both
the United States and Japan. To address this threat, the Ministers committed
to enhance cooperation on cyber issues, including deterrence and response
capabilities, but as a matter of priority, emphasized that each nation is
responsible for developing the relevant capabilities to protect their national
networks and critical infrastructure. The Ministers affirmed that international
law applies in cyberspace and that a cyber attack could, in certain
circumstances, constitute an armed attack for the purposes of Article V of the
U.S.-Japan Security Treaty. The Ministers also affirmed that a decision as to
when a cyber attack would constitute an armed attack under Article V would
be made on a case-by-case basis, and through close consultations between
Japan and the United States, as would be the case for any other threat.
The Ministers recognized the critical role that U.S. extended deterrence
plays in ensuring the security of Japan, as well as the peace and stability of
the Indo-Pacific region. The United States reiterated its commitment to the
defense of Japan through the full range of U.S. military capabilities, including
conventional and nuclear.
The Ministers reiterated the importance of the international community’s
ongoing commitment to achieving North Korea’s abandonment of all of its
weapons of mass destruction, ballistic missiles, and related programs and
facilities in a complete, verifiable, and irreversible manner in accordance with
relevant UN Security Council resolutions. The Ministers welcomed the United
States’ diplomatic efforts to achieve the final, fully verified denuclearization of
the Korean Peninsula, including through the U.S.-North Korea Summits. The
Ministers affirmed their commitment to lead international efforts in UNSCR
implementation, particularly in combatting illicit ship-to-ship transfers, and
the Ministers committed to strengthen and enhance cooperation with other
partner countries participating in UNSCR implementation. The Ministers also
recognized the successful efforts to bring back U.S. nationals held in North
Korea, and called upon North Korea to resolve the Japanese abductions issue
immediately.

**Operational Readiness and Cooperation**
 The Ministers committed to deepen operational cooperation as a means
to improve Alliance readiness, interoperability, and deterrence, which
are critical components for both peacetime and contingency operations.
As a result, the Ministers welcomed the steady implementation of mutual
asset protection; bilateral presence and joint Intelligence, Surveillance
and Reconnaissance operations; increased scope of logistical support
under the Acquisition and Cross Servicing Agreement; and ongoing
exchange of liaison officers.
 The Ministers also reaffirmed that the two Governments would promote
joint/shared use of the facilities of the Self-Defense Forces of Japan
and U.S. Forces, in addition to operational training areas, to enhance
interoperability, deterrence, and response capability, and to build a
stronger relationship with local communities. The Ministers welcomed
steady progress in both bilateral planning and cooperation on noncombatant evacuation operations.
**II. U.S. Forces in Japan**
 The Ministers reaffirmed the two Governments’ commitment to steadily
implement the realignment of U.S. forces in order to improve operational
readiness and deterrent capabilities, while continuing efforts to mitigate
the impact on local communities. The Ministers welcomed initiatives to
build and strengthen U.S. forces’ community relations programs.
 The Ministers welcomed the progress on facility improvements of
Nyutabaru Air Base and Tsuiki Air Base of the Air Self-Defense Force
for contingency use of aircraft.
 The Ministers welcomed the relocation of the carrier air wing squadrons
from Atsugi Air Facility to MCAS Iwakuni last year. The United States
also expressed appreciation for the Government of Japan’s continued
efforts to acquire Mageshima for a new SDF facility. This facility will
support operations such as large-scale disaster response as well as
regular exercises and other activities, including as a permanent field
carrier landing practice (FCLP) site for use by U.S. forces. The United
States reiterated that a permanent FCLP facility will greatly contribute
to the safe operation and training of U.S. forces. The Ministers expressed
their intention to work closely in order to complete the development of
the permanent facility at the earliest possible date.
 The Ministers welcomed progress in the steady implementation of
the Guam International Agreement, and the planned relocation of
approximately 9,000 U.S. Marine Corps personnel from Okinawa to
locations outside of Japan. They reconfirmed the plan to begin the
relocation to Guam in the first half of the 2020s.
 The Ministers recognized the importance of aviation safety and
addressing public concerns related to this issue. The Ministers committed
to facilitate prompt exchanges of information, and to continue a regular
bilateral dialogue regarding aviation safety. Both sides recognized the
necessity of all training, including aviation training, to maintain the
highest levels of readiness and capabilities for the Alliance.


**III. Working with Partners for a Free and Open Indo-Pacific**
 The Ministers reiterated their support for ASEAN centrality and unity
and their commitment to multilateral cooperation in Southeast Asia,
including through joint training and exercises, capacity building,
defense equipment and technology cooperation, and support for
ASEAN-related architecture, including the East Asia Summit, the
ASEAN Regional Forum, and the ASEAN Defense Minister’s Meeting
Plus. To support the autonomous and sustainable development of
countries in the Mekong region, the Ministers committed to work
closely in support of regional countries to address shared transboundary
challenges, including transnational crime and trafficking, regional
connectivity, energy security, and enhanced energy system integration.
 The Ministers welcomed continued cooperation and high-level
consultation among the United States, Japan, and Australia, including
through the Trilateral Strategic Dialogue, and noted the importance of
trilateral joint exercises and capacity building in Southeast Asian and
Pacific island countries. The Ministers also noted with satisfaction the
first Japan-U.S.-India trilateral summit meeting in 2018 and highlighted
significant joint exercises, such as Malabar 2018 and Cope India 2018.
Building upon these various trilateral efforts, the Ministers welcomed
the regularization of quadrilateral engagement among Japan, the United
States, Australia, and India. The Ministers also welcomed the increasing
regional presence of the United Kingdom and France, and called for
further cooperation in areas including activities in support of freedom
of navigation, port calls, and countering illicit ship-to-ship transfers.
 The Ministers called for full respect for freedoms of navigation and
overflight and other lawful uses of the sea, and reiterated the importance
of activities that support those principles. The Ministers urged all parties
to pursue demilitarization of disputed features in the SCS, resolve all
maritime disputes peacefully without resorting to the threat or use of
force, clarify their maritime claims in accordance with the international
law of the sea as reflected in the 1982 Law of the Sea Convention, and
fully respect legal and diplomatic processes.
 The Ministers underscored the importance of the July 2016 PhilippinesChina Arbitral Tribunal’s Award for the two parties. The Ministers
also emphasized the importance of a Code of Conduct in the SCS that
is in full accordance with international law and upholds the right of
ASEAN member states to partner with countries and foreign entities of
their choosing, including with respect to hydrocarbon development and
military exercises.
**IV. Tokyo 2020 Olympic and Paralympic Games**
 The Ministers confirmed that the two Governments intend to continue
to work closely together through a whole-of-government effort toward
a successful Tokyo 2020 Olympic and Paralympic Games.

**Reference 24  The SACO Final Report (tentative translation)**

(December 2, 1996)
The Special Action Committee on Okinawa (SACO) was established in
November 1995 by the Governments of Japan and the United States. The
two Governments launched the SACO process to reduce the burden on
the people of Okinawa and thereby strengthen the Japan–U.S. alliance.
The mandate and guidelines for the SACO process were set forth by
the Governments of Japan and the United States at the outset of the
joint endeavor. Both sides decided that the SACO would develop
recommendations for the Security Consultative Committee (SCC) on ways
to realign, consolidate and reduce U.S. facilities and areas, and adjust
operational procedures of U.S. forces in Okinawa consistent with their
respective obligations under the Treaty of Mutual Cooperation and
Security and other related agreements. The work of the SACO was
scheduled to conclude after one year.
The SCC which was held on April 15, 1996, approved the SACO Interim
Report which included several significant initiatives, and instructed the
SACO to complete and recommend plans with concrete implementation
schedules by November 1996.
The SACO, together with the Joint Committee, has conducted a series
of intensive and detailed discussions and developed concrete plans and
measures to implement the recommendations set forth in the Interim
Report.
Today, at the SCC, Minister Ikeda, Minister Kyuma, Secretary Perry and
Ambassador Mondale approved this SACO Final Report. The plans and
measures included in this Final Report, when implemented, will reduce
the impact of the activities of U.S. forces on communities in Okinawa. At
the same time, these measures will fully maintain the capabilities and
readiness of U.S. forces in Japan while addressing security and force
protection requirements. Approximately 21 percent of the total acreage of
the U.S. facilities and areas in Okinawa excluding joint use facilities and
areas (approx. 5,002ha/12,361 acres) will be returned.
Upon approving the Final Report, the members of the SCC welcomed
the successful conclusion of the yearlong SACO process and underscored
their strong resolve to continue joint efforts to ensure steady and prompt
implementation of the plans and measures of the SACO Final Report. With
this understanding, the SCC designated the Joint Committee as the
primary forum for bilateral coordination in the implementation phase,
where specific conditions for the completion of each item will be
addressed. Coordination with local communities will take place as
necessary.
The SCC also reaffirmed the commitment of the two governments to
make every endeavor to deal with various issues related to the presence
and status of U.S. forces, and to enhance mutual understanding between
U.S. forces and local Japanese communities. In this respect, the SCC
agreed that efforts to these ends should continue, primarily through
coordination at the Joint Committee.
The members of the SCC agreed that the SCC itself and the Security
Sub-Committee (SSC) would monitor such coordination at the Joint
Committee described above and provide guidance as appropriate. The
SCC also instructed the SSC to seriously address the Okinawa-related
issues as one of the most important subjects and regularly report back to
the SCC on this subject.
In accordance with the April 1996 Japan–U.S. Joint Declaration on
Security, the SCC emphasized the importance of close consultation on the
international situation, defense policies and military postures, bilateral
policy coordination and efforts towards a more peaceful and stable
security environment in the Asia-Pacific region. The SCC instructed the
SSC to pursue these goals and to address the Okinawa related issues at
the same time.
**Return Land:**
— Futenma Air Station—See attached.
— Northern Training Area
Return major portion of the Northern Training Area (approx. 3,987ha/
9,852 acres) and release U.S. joint use of certain reservoirs (approx.
159ha/393 acres) with the intention to finish the process by the end of
March 2003 under the following conditions:
� Provide land area (approx. 38ha/93 acres) and water area (approx.
121ha/298 acres) with the intention to finish the process by the end
of March 1998 in order to ensure access from the remaining Northern
Training Area to the ocean.

Committee

**The SACO Final Report on Futenma Air Station**
**(an integral part of the SACO Final Report) (tentative translation)**
(Tokyo, Japan, December 2, 1996)
1. Introduction
a. At the Security Consultative Committee (SCC) held on December 2,
1996, Minister Ikeda, Minister Kyuma, Secretary Perry, and
Ambassador Mondale reaffirmed their commitment to the Special
Action Committee on Okinawa (SACO) Interim Report of April 15,
1996 and the Status Report of September 19, 1996. Based on the
SACO Interim Report, both Governments have been working to
determine a suitable option for the return of Futenma Air Station
and the relocation of its assets to other facilities and areas in
Okinawa, while maintaining the airfield’s critical military functions
and capabilities. The Status Report called for the Special Working
Group on Futenma to examine three specific alternatives: 1)
incorporate the heliport into Kadena Air Base; 2) construct a heliport
at Camp Schwab; and 3) develop and construct a sea-based facility
(SBF).
b. On December 2, 1996, the SCC approved the SACO recommendation
to pursue the SBF option. Compared to the other two options, the
SBF is judged to be the best option in terms of enhanced safety and
quality of life for the Okinawan people while maintaining
operational capabilities of U.S. forces. In addition, the SBF can
function as a fixed facility during its use as a military base and can
also be removed when no longer necessary.
c. The SCC will establish a bilateral U.S.–Japan working group under
the supervision of the Security Sub-Committee (SSC) entitled the
Futenma Implementation Group (FIG), to be supported by a team of
technical experts. The FIG, working with the Joint Committee, will
develop a plan for implementation no later than December 1997.
Upon SCC approval of this plan, the FIG, working with the Joint
Committee, will oversee design, construction, testing, and transfer
of assets. Throughout this process, the FIG will periodically report to
the SSC on the status of its work.
2. Decisions of the SCC
a. Pursue construction of an SBF to absorb most of the helicopter
operational functions of Futenma Air Station. This facility will be
approximately 1,500 meters long, and will support the majority of
Futenma Air Station’s flying operations, including an Instrument
Fli ht R l (IFR) bl ( i t l 1 300 t


long), direct air operations support, and indirect support
infrastructure such as headquarters, maintenance, logistics, qualityof-life functions, and base operating support. The SBF will be
designed to support basing of helicopter assets, and will also be
able to support short-field aircraft operations.
b. Transfer 12 KC-130 aircraft to Iwakuni Air Base. Construct facilities at
this base to ensure that associated infrastructure is available to
support these aircraft and their missions.
c. Develop additional facilities at Kadena Air Base to support aircraft,
maintenance, and logistics operations which are currently available
at Futenma Air Station but are not relocated to the SBF or Iwakuni
Air Base.
d. Study the emergency and contingency use of alternate facilities,
which may be needed in the event of a crisis. This is necessary
because the transfer of functions from Futenma Air Station to the
SBF will reduce operational flexibility currently available.
e. Return Futenma Air Station within the next five to seven years, after
adequate replacement facilities are completed and operational.
3. Guiding Principles
a. Futenma Air Station’s critical military functions and capabilities will
be maintained and will continue to operate at current readiness
levels throughout the transfer of personnel and equipment and the
relocation of facilities.
b. To the greatest extent possible, Futenma Air Station’s operations
and activities will be transferred to the SBF. Operational capabilities
and contingency planning flexibility which cannot be supported by
the shorter runway of the SBF (such as strategic airlift, logistics,
emergency alternate divert, and contingency throughput) must be
fully supported elsewhere. Those facilities unable to be located on
the SBF, due to operational cost, or quality-of-life considerations, will
be located on existing U.S. facilities and areas.
c. The SBF will be located off the east coast of the main island of
Okinawa, and is expected to be connected to land by a pier or
causeway. Selection of the location will take into account
operational requirements, airspace and sea-lane deconfliction,
fishing access, environmental compatibility, economic effects, noise
abatement, survivability, security, and convenient, acceptable
personnel access to other U.S. military facilities and housing.
d. The design of the SBF will incorporate adequate measures to ensure
platform, aircraft, equipment, and personnel survivability against
severe weather and ocean conditions; corrosion control treatment
and prevention for the SBF and all equipment located on the SBF;
safety; and platform security. Support will include reliable and
secure fuel supply, electrical power, fresh water, and other utilities
and consumables. Additionally, the facility will be fully selfsupporting for short-period contingency/emergency operations.
e. The Government of Japan will provide the SBF and other relocation
facilities for the use of U.S. forces, in accordance with the U.S.–Japan
Treaty of Mutual Cooperation and Security and the Status of Forces
Agreement. The two Governments will further consider all aspects
of life-cycle costs as part of the design/acquisition decision.
f. The Government of Japan will continue to keep the people of
Okinawa informed of the progress of this plan, including concept,
location, and schedules of implementation.
4. Possible Sea-Based Facility Construction Methods
Studies have been conducted by a “Technical Support Group”
comprised of Government engineers under the guidance of a
“Technical Advisory Group” comprised of university professors and
other experts outside the Government. These studies suggested that
all three construction methods mentioned below are technically
feasible.
a. Pile Supported Pier Type (using floating modules)—supported by a
number of steel columns fixed to the sea bed.
b. Pontoon Type—platform consisting of steel pontoon type units,
installed in a calm sea protected by a breakwater.
c. Semi-Submersible Type—platform at a wave free height, supported
by buoyancy of the lower structure submerged under the sea.
5. The Next Steps
a. The FIG will recommend a candidate SBF area to the SCC as soon as
possible and formulate a detailed implementation plan no later
than December 1997. This plan will include completion of the
following items: concept development and definitions of
operational requirements, technology performance specifications
and construction method, site survey, environmental analysis, and
final concept and site selection.
b. The FIG will establish phases and schedules to achieve operational
capabilities at each location, including facility design, construction,
installation of required components, validation tests and suitability
demonstrations, and transfer of operations to the new facility.
c. The FIG will conduct periodic reviews and make decisions at
significant milestones concerning SBF program feasibility.

**Reference 29  Outline of the Act on Special Measures on Smooth Implementation of the Realignment of United States Forces in Japan**

1. Purpose


It is critically important to realize the realignment of the United States Forces in Japan (USFJ), in order to contribute to the maintenance of peace and
security in Japan and to mitigate the impact of defense facilities on surrounding residents by all of Japan. In this light, the purpose of this Act is to
contribute to the smooth implementation of USFJ realignment by taking the following special measures, etc.


2. Special Measures, etc.

(1) Realignment grants for municipalities incurring greater impacts


 In connection with the realignment of USFJ, the national government designates defense facilities for which it is deemed that consideration must be paid to
their increasing impacts on the stability of the lives of the residents in the surrounding areas. Realignment grants are awarded to municipalities in the area
of such defense facilities, in order to cover the expenses of the projects that contribute to making the residents’ lives more convenient and to developing
industries, if the grants are considered necessary to help carry out the USFJ realignment smoothly and infallibly.

 The national government takes into consideration the extent that the stability of the lives of the residents is impacted, and awards the realignment grants

based on both the progress of the measures for achieving realignment and the length of time that has passed since the measures were first implemented.

(2) Public project special provisions for areas incurring particularly large impacts


 Designate areas that include municipalities incurring particularly large impacts as Special Area for Development concerning Realignment, and promote the

development of these areas by establishing special provisions for cost sharing by local governments when developing roads, ports, and other infrastructure.

 Set up at the MOD the Council for Local Development concerning Realignment of U.S. Forces in Japan and Related SDF Forces comprised of relevant

ministers, and at the Council’s meetings discuss matters such as the designation of the Special Area for Development concerning Realignment and the
establishment of the development plan for the area (Development Plan for Special Area for Development concerning Realignment).

(3) Measures for USFJ local employees


 Implement skills education and training that contribute to the continuous employment of USFJ local employees.


3. Expiration of the Law

This Act expires on March 31, 2027; provided, however, that the realignment grants will be awarded until March 31, 2032 at the latest based on
the situation of the realignment.


Notes: 1. At the time of its enactment this Act was set to expire on March 31, 2017. However, the term of validity has been extended by 10 years to March 31, 2027 pursuantto
the law for the partial revision of this Act which entered into force on March 31, 2017.
2. At the time of its enactment, this Act provided for the special measures, etc. under this Act in 2. (1) to (3) above, as well as for special provisions for the operations of
the Japan Bank for International Cooperation for the implementation of investments and loans for family housing and infrastructure development related to USFJ
relocation to the United States of America (Guam) for the promotion of said relocation.
However, the said provision was abolished pursuant to the law for the partial revision of this Act which entered into force on March 31, 2017, after the 2+2 Joint
Statement of April 2012 limited Japan’ s financial commitment for the relocation of the U.S. Marine Corps in Okinawa to Guam to direct cash contribution and it was
confirmed that other forms of financial assistance (investments and loans) would not be utilized.

**Reference 47  Vientiane Vision 2.0**


Key Elements

-  Reviewing our efforts over the past three years on defense cooperation with ASEAN under the Vientiane Vision announced in November 2016

-  Redefining the vision in line with the concept of the “Indo-Pacific”

-  Presenting three principles for our defense cooperation with ASEAN and including enhancement of resilience as one of the ends


Contents

1. Review of our efforts under the Vientiane Vision
(1) Multilateral efforts: Ship Rider Cooperation Program, HA/DR Invitation Program and Professional Airmanship Program

-  Heart-to-heart cooperation: Japan has contributed not only to enhancing participants’ abilities by offering various practical programs, but also to
creating a sense of unity among all ASEAN member state participants by offering opportunities to work together on common issues.
(2) Bilateral efforts: Defense cooperation programs (e.g. maritime security, HA/DR and engineering), defense equipment and technology cooperation, human
resource development and academic exchanges, etc.

-  Tailored and lasting cooperation: Aiming to establish a self-standing system in partner countries, Japan has implemented various projects based on
elaborate multi-year plans with special emphasis on the transparency of process.
(3) Having contributed to the enhancement of ASEAN’ s capabilities as a whole, especially in
(i) Ensuring the rule of law, (ii) Strengthening maritime security, and (iii) Assisting ASEAN’ s autonomous responses to regional challenges, such as
natural disasters and non-traditional threats.
In so doing, we have also reaffirmed the importance of continuing and developing our efforts to uphold ASEAN’ s resilience, which is a basis for
ASEAN centrality and unity.
⇒ Pursuing further practical cooperation to support ASEAN’ s resilience, and in turn, its centrality and unity

2. Redefining the Vientiane Vision in line with the concept of the “Indo-Pacific”
(1) As the hinge connecting the Indian and Pacific Oceans, ASEAN is the key to regional cooperation.
(2) ASEAN’ s principles outlined in the “ASEAN Outlook on the Indo-Pacific,” such as openness, transparency, inclusivity and a rules-based framework, share
the same bases with those of Japan’ s vision for a “Free and Open Indo-Pacific.”
(3) Under its vision for a “Free and Open Indo-Pacific,” and with full respect for the “ASEAN Outlook on the Indo-Pacific,” Japan will promote equal and open
cooperation through partnership with ASEAN member states and all other countries that share the principles outlined above.

3. Three Principles for Japan’ s Defense Cooperation with ASEAN
(1) Heart-to-heart Cooperation: Upholding ASEAN’ s principles, valuing people-to-people connections and listening sincerely to partners’ needs
(2) Tailored and Lasting Cooperation: Pursuing sustainable outcomes through well-planned, transparent and ongoing engagement
(3) Equal and Open Cooperation: Pursuing wide-ranging international collaboration that supports ASEAN centrality, unity and resilience

I. Ends: With a view to ensuring a free and open Indo-Pacific that holds Southeast Asia as its hinge, the Japan Ministry of Defense aims to
(i) enhance the Japan-ASEAN Strategic Partnership and (ii) contribute to ASEAN centrality and unity by supporting its resilience.

II. Ways: On the basis of the above three principles, Japan aims to support ASEAN centrality, unity and resilience by taking the following

approaches with special emphasis on the three key areas of cooperation.
(i) Approaches based on the principles of ASEAN centrality and unity

-  With a view to upholding ASEAN centrality, Japan promotes international collaboration between ASEAN member states and countries outside ASEAN,
with a central emphasis on ASEAN-led frameworks

-  With a view to upholding ASEAN unity, Japan promotes confidence-building and interoperability among ASEAN member states by enhancing
connectivity and promoting shared norms and practices among defense authorities
(ii) Key areas of cooperation with a view to upholding ASEAN’ s resilience

-  Ensuring the rule of law: Promoting the development and sharing of universal norms regarding the sea and air space

-  Strengthening maritime security: Promoting ASEAN’ s efforts to enhance maritime domain awareness capabilities, and supporting individual states’
efforts to enhance their national security, and in turn, regional peace and stability

-  Assisting ASEAN’ s organizational responses to regional challenges: Promoting ASEAN’ s efforts to enhance its capacity to deal with natural
disasters and non-traditional threats

III. Means: As part of a concerted whole of government effort, JMOD conducts practical cooperation by combining the following diverse mea-

sures.
(i) Promoting Shared Understanding of International Norms: Holding programs such as seminars with a view to share knowledge on international norms
and practices
(ii) Defense Cooperation Program: Assisting ASEAN’ s proactive efforts for enhancing its collective capabilities by sending JSDF personnel to Southeast

**1. Clarification of cases where transfers are prohibited**
Overseas transfer of defense equipment and technology will not be
permitted when:
1) the transfer violates obligations under treaties and other international
agreements that Japan has concluded,
2) the transfer violates obligations under United Nations Security Council
resolutions, or
3) the defense equipment and technology is destined for a country party to
a conflict (a country against which the United Nations Security Council
is taking measures to maintain or restore international peace and security
in the event of an armed attack).

**2. Limitation to cases where transfers may be permitted as well as strict**
**examination and information disclosure**
In cases not within 1. above, cases where transfers may be permitted will
be limited to the following cases. Those cases will be examined strictly
while ensuring transparency. More specifically, overseas transfer of defense
equipment and technology may be permitted in such cases as the transfer
contributes to active promotion of peace contribution and international
cooperation, or to Japan’s security from the viewpoint of—implementing
international joint development and production projects with countries
cooperating with Japan in security area including its ally, the U.S. (hereinafter
referred to as “the ally and partners”), —enhancing security and defense
cooperation with the ally and partners, as well as—supporting the activities
of the Self-Defense Forces including the maintenance of its equipment and
ensuring the safety of Japanese nationals. The Government will conduct
strict examination on the appropriateness of the destination and end user,
and the extent the overseas transfer of such equipment and technology
will raise concern for Japan’s security. Then the Government will make a
comprehensive judgment in light of the existing guidelines of the international
export control regime and based on the information available at the time of
export examinations.
Significant cases that require especially careful consideration from the
viewpoint of Japan’s security will be examined at the National Security
Council (NSC). As for the cases that were deliberated at the NSC, the
Government will disclose their information in accordance with the Act on
Access to Information Held by Administrative Organs (Law No. 42 of 1999)
.
**3. Ensuring appropriate control regarding extra-purpose use or transfer to**
**third parties**
In cases satisfying 2. above, overseas transfer of defense equipment and
technology will be permitted only in cases where appropriate control is
ensured. More concretely, the Government will in principle oblige the
Government of the recipient country to gain its prior consent regarding
extra-purpose use and transfer to third parties. However, appropriate control
may be ensured with the confirmation of control system at the destination in
such cases as those where the transfer is judged to be appropriate for active
promotion of peace contribution and international cooperation, when the
transfer involves participation in an international system for sharing parts etc.,
and when the transfer involves delivery of parts etc. to a licenser.
Implementation guidelines for the policy described above will be decided
by the NSC. The Minister of Economy, Trade and Industry will implement the
Foreign Exchange and Foreign Trade Act (Law No.228 of 1949) appropriately
in accordance with the decision.
For the purpose of this policy, “defense equipment and technology” refers
to “arms and military technologies”; “arms” refers to items listed in Section 1,
Annexed List 1 of the Export Trade Control Order (Cabinet Order No. 378 of
1949), and are to be used by military forces and directly employed in combat;
and “military technologies” refers to technologies for the design, production
or use of arms.
The Government will contribute actively to the peace and stability of
the international community as a “Proactive Contributor to Peace” based on
the principle of international cooperation. Under such policy, it will play a
proactive role in the area of controlling defense equipment and technology as
well as sensitive dual-use goods and technologies to achieve the early entry
into force of the Arms Trade Treaty and further strengthen the international
export control regimes.


**Reference 57  Three Principles on Transfer of Defense Equipment and**
**Technology**

(Approved by the National Security Council
and the Cabinet on April 1, 2014)
The Government has made it its basic policy to deal with overseas transfer
of defense equipment and technology in a careful manner in accordance
with Prime Minster Eisaku Sato’s remarks at the Diet in 1967 (hereinafter
referred to as “the Three Principles on Arms Exports”) and the collateral
policy guideline by the Miki administration in 1976. These policy guidelines
have played a certain role as Japan has been following the path of a peaceloving nation. On the other hand, these policy guidelines including the nonpermission of arms exports to communist bloc countries have increasingly
proved unsuitable for the current situation. Also, the Government has
repeatedly taken exemption measures depending on the individual necessity
of each case since arms exports to substantially all areas were not permitted,
as a result of not promoting arms exports regardless of the destinations.
Japan has consistently followed the path of a peace-loving nation since
the end of World War II. Japan has adhered to a basic policy of maintaining
an exclusively national defense-oriented policy, not becoming a military
power that poses a threat to other countries, and observing the Three NonNuclear Principles. At the same time, surrounded by an increasingly severe
security environment and confronted by complex and grave national security
challenges, it has become essential for Japan to make more proactive efforts
in line with the principle of international cooperation. Japan cannot secure its
own peace and security by itself, and the international community expects
Japan to play a more proactive role for peace and stability in the world
commensurate with its national capabilities. Against this backdrop, under the
evolving security environment, Japan will continue to adhere to the course
that it has taken to date as a peace-loving nation, and as a major player in
world politics and the world economy, contribute even more proactively
in securing peace, stability and prosperity of the international community,
while achieving its own security as well as peace and stability in the AsiaPacific region, as a “Proactive Contributor to Peace” based on the principle of
international cooperation.
From the view point of achieving the fundamental principle of national
security by implementing concrete policies, the Government, in accordance
with the National Security Strategy adopted on December 17, 2013, decided
to review the Government’s existing policy guidelines on overseas transfer
of defense equipment and technology, and set out clear principles which fit
the new security environment while giving due consideration to the roles that
the existing policy guidelines have played so far and by consolidating the
policy guidelines comprehensively with consideration on the past exemption
measures.
An appropriate overseas transfer of defense equipment and technology
contributes to further active promotion of the maintenance of international
peace and security through timely and effective implementation of
contribution to peace and international cooperation such as international peace
cooperation, international disaster relief, humanitarian assistance, responses
to international terrorism and piracy, and capacity building of developing
countries (hereinafter referred to as “peace contribution and international
cooperation”). Such transfer also contributes to strengthening security and
defense cooperation with Japan’s ally, the United States as well as other
countries. Furthermore, it contributes to maintaining and enhancing Japan’s
defense production and technological bases, thereby contributing to Japan’s
enhancement of defense capability, given that international joint development
and production projects have become the international mainstream in order to
improve the performance of defense equipment and to deal with their rising
costs.
On the other hand, since the distribution of defense equipment and
technology has significant security, social, economic and humanitarian impact
on the international community, the need for each government to control the
transfer of defense equipment and technology in a responsible manner while
taking various factors into account is recognized.
In light of the above, while maintaining its basic philosophy as a peaceloving nation that conforms to the Charter of the United Nations and the course
it has taken as a peace-loving nation, Japan will control the overseas transfer
of defense equipment and technology based on the following three principles.
The overseas transfer of facilities related to arms production will continue to
be treated in the same manner as defense equipment and technology.
