### Executive Summary

Defence remains of paramount importance to this State and, as a vital element of overall

security policy, provides the bedrock of stability and prosperity across political, social,

economic and environmental domains.

The White Paper on Defence was approved by Government in July 2015 and provides the

strategic and comprehensive defence policy framework for the period up to 2025. It was

developed following a lengthy consultation process that involved extensive stakeholder

consultation. While ultimately approved by Government, and reflective of the fact that a

range of government departments and state agencies have primary responsibilities when it

comes to the security of the State and its citizens, development of the White Paper was led

by the Minister for Defence, supported by a high-level civil-military Steering Group.

One of the most significant commitments made by Government in the White Paper is to

ensure that defence policy remains up to date and to bring certainty and regularity to the

process of defence planning and overall preparedness. This is being achieved through the

introduction of a new fixed cycle of defence reviews, to be carried out every three years. The

first such review is this White Paper Update, with the next iteration under the cycle being a

more comprehensive Strategic Defence Review. The White Paper specifies that these reviews

are to encompass a fully updated assessment of the security environment and a fresh

consideration of implications for overall policy requirements, associated tasks, capability

development and resourcing.  Into the future, the fixed cycle reviews will be integrated with

the security assessments undertaken by the newly established National Security Analysis

Centre.

The hallmarks of Defence policy will continue to be:

   - a policy of active military neutrality;

   - a highly engaged and participative approach internationally, particularly through the

United Nations (UN) and European Union (EU);

1


-----

   - a commitment to defence provision appropriate to present and contingent

requirements;

   - strong recognition of the individual and collective contribution of members of the

Defence Forces and the requirement to value these as vital elements of Ireland’s

statehood.

At the outset, the 2015 White Paper sets out a comprehensive and forward-looking

assessment of the dynamic security environment. This provides the context for the

Government’s defence policy response and the defence contribution to security, including

defence of the State from armed aggression and the defence contribution to domestic

security through provision of a wide range of day-to-day supports to An Garda Síochána.

Furthermore, in an effort to maximise value for money achieved from defence expenditure,

for the broader benefit of the State, the White Paper also makes provision for “non-security”

policy requirements with the associated provision of a range of services to other departments

and agencies. All of these requirements are reflected in the various roles that Government

assigned to the Defence Forces in the White Paper.

The updating of the security environment assessment from the 2015 White Paper is the

starting point in this Update. The review was completed by a high-level inter
departmental/inter-agency group led by the Department of Defence. This comprised senior

Defence Forces’ representation as well as various other departments and agencies with

security responsibilities, including the Department of Justice and Equality and An Garda

Síochána. The review concludes that while the essential aggregate level of threat facing this

State has not altered in a way to justify increasing the overall stated level of threat, the

position has developed and changed in the period since 2015. Events internationally now

impact on our political, social, economic and environmental well-being, in ever more complex

ways and patterns. The threats in the cyber domain, and from espionage, have been assessed

as increasing since 2015 while the wider political global environment is now more complex

and uncertain.

In light of the updated assessment of the increasingly dynamic security environment, the

Government do not propose any policy change in their overall approach to Defence including

2


-----

in relation to the roles of the Defence Forces as set out in the White Paper.  In essence, the

Update affirms the fundamentals of the White Paper’s approach while recognising that there

are challenges that will require a continued and unrelenting focus. Some of these are

significant, such as in the area of human resources and in certain specialist areas. It is notable

that since 2015 overseas operations have increased in tempo while critical supports provided

on a daily basis to An Garda Síochána have continued to be met to a very high standard.

Nevertheless, there is a recognised difference between meeting commitments within service

parameters, for example as laid down in Service Level Agreements, and the desired level of

output, and contingency, if operating at close to a full establishment of 9,500 Permanent

Defence Force (PDF) personnel. The Defence Forces are below their establishment,

significantly so in the case of the Air Corps and Naval Service and it remains a key priority to

turn this around.

This Update has reviewed key capability priorities, as set out in the White Paper. Human

Resources are a key component of capability and the White Paper sets out a comprehensive

agenda for HR development. This Update recognises that the current gap in PDF strength

below establishment is a capability deficiency. The current shortfall is especially marked in

specialist areas, where small numbers are more vulnerable to gaps. Without giving rise to

any compromise on safety, the impact of these shortfalls results in greater pressure on

individual members and units; there have also been impacts on the scope of Air and Naval

operations and the operational availability of some aircraft and the overall number of ships

that have to be managed carefully. Priority will remain on the measures underway to address

these challenges, although this Update also gives recognition to the possibility of the need for

additionality in certain areas including special forces, cyber, safety management,

headquarters (including capability development and joint operations) and other specialist

roles.

Finalisation of this Update has coincided with publication of the Third Report of the Public

Service Pay Commission (PSPC), which carried out a comprehensive examination of

recruitment and retention issues in the Defence Sector. The Government have put in place a

High Level Implementation Plan that includes a range of improvements in remuneration,

along with the building blocks for further important initiatives. A new joint civil-military

3


-----

Programme Management Office (PMO) has been established to facilitate full implementation

of the Plan. The new Plan, based on the PSPC’s recommendations, will result in

reprioritisation of some of the existing White Paper human resources related projects. The

new PMO, under the direction of the Minister, will ensure that existing projects are

assimilated into the new work programme in an effective way. The PMO will also provide

staff support to project sponsors and facilitate close coordination with the non-Defence

contributors, namely the Department of the Taoiseach and the Department of Public

Expenditure and Reform.

The review of White Paper projects, carried out as part of this Update, has resulted in a

number of important decisions being taken that will have a bearing on overall prioritisation

and sequencing of projects. This includes those currently underway and those now ear
marked for earliest possible commencement within the framework of the overall ten-year

implementation programme (2015 to 2025). In particular, the importance of the projects to

conduct a gap-analysis of skill-sets within the PDF and the advancement of the Capability

Development Function surfaced as key requirements. The gap analysis project, which is to

identify the extent of skill gaps and appropriate measures to address them, is key to

commencement of certain other projects, including a number that relate to the Reserve

Defence Force (RDF). Its importance has been further emphasised by the focus on workforce

planning in the High Level Plan to implement the Report of the PSPC. The sequencing of

certain projects with a view to their completion prior to finalisation of the approaching

Strategic Defence Review is also addressed. Moreover, the Secretary General and Chief of

Staff, who are joint sponsors of the review of high level command and control project, have

noted that this project is of major significance.

In terms of funding, this Update has noted that the multi-annual capital programme, launched

as _Project Ireland 2040, has increased the overall level of investment with a total of €541_

million for Defence up to 2022. Major investment priorities have been advanced including

the upgrade programme of the Army’s fleet of 80 Armoured Personnel Carriers, delivery of

four new Offshore Patrol Vessels to the Naval Service, while three new PC12 aircraft, with

considerably enhanced capabilities, are currently being built for the Air Corps.

4


-----

In support of this, comprehensive plans are being developed to guide the equipment and

infrastructure project priorities across the White Paper based on the available funding

envelope.

Planning is also underway for the acquisition of a Multi-Role Vessel to replace the Naval

Service flagship LÉ Eithne, and a Mid-Life Extension Programme of the Naval Service’s two

P50 class vessels has commenced. Following a tender competition, a preferred bidder has

recently been identified, and contract negotiations are ongoing, for the replacement of the

Air Corps’ two CASA Maritime Patrol Aircraft.

Meanwhile, over €30m has been invested on a range of infrastructure projects across all

formations since 2016. However, recognising that investment had been constrained, there is

continuing scope to enhance investment in military facilities. Currently, some €37m worth of

infrastructure development projects are at various stages of implementation. These projects

include the upgrade and modernisation of Army, Air Corps and Naval Service facilities. In

January 2020, a focussed five year infrastructure programme, utilising the investment

provided for in Project Ireland 2040, will be launched.

While these equipment and infrastructure projects are all positive developments in their own

right, and are reflective of ongoing collaboration between civil and military personnel within

the Department of Defence, and with the various military formations, this Update

nevertheless points to the continuing potential for additional investment in capital projects.

Present funding levels result in major equipment platforms being replaced only sequentially,

or over extended periods of acquisition. It remains the case that a range of equipment

requirements identified in the White Paper cannot be advanced for some time or will await

additional investment becoming available. Thus, for the present, these requirements fall

outside what can be prioritised within existing budgets. Meanwhile, demands on capability,

which continue to become more sophisticated and dynamic, along with the need to take

account of climate change objectives, all point to continuing enhanced investment

requirements.

5


-----

In the international sphere, this Update reinforces Ireland’s active approach to international

engagement as an absolute necessity in the present and likely future security environment.

It also underlines the fact that Ireland’s defence policy approach of military neutrality is not

isolationist and cannot provide a protective buffer against global events or developments in

the security environment which impact on this country. Ireland’s very active engagement in

the UN, the EU, North Atlantic Treaty Organisation’s (NATO) Partnership for Peace (PfP) and

the Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe (OSCE) remain central components

of our security policy as this participation is the primary means by which we can shape events

or policies taken individually or collectively by other States that may impact here.

In terms of the RDF, the White Paper is clear that there is a continued requirement to retain

and develop the RDF. This Update recognises that a key challenge is to recruit, train and

retain sufficient personnel to meet the Reserve establishment provided for in the White

Paper. However, it is also necessary to strike an appropriate balance in terms of the supports

needed to achieve PDF and RDF recruitment and the priority in recent years has necessarily

been on PDF recruitment.

As regards Civil Defence, this Update recognises the essential supports provided by volunteers

and progress made in relation to the Government’s commitment to the continued

development of Civil Defence around its central strategic objective of supporting the Principal

Response Agencies in a variety of emergency and non-emergency situations.

Finally, as regards Brexit, this Update was undertaken, and has been finalised, while Brexit

continues to evolve. The precise security implications of Brexit remain hard to predict, albeit

that the overall setting in which security resides may be adversely impacted. Nevertheless,

this Update notes that both the EU and the UK share the same security and defence interests

and both are committed to the establishment of the necessary mechanisms to work closely

together following the UK’s departure from the EU. Meanwhile, the Defence Organisation

remains fully engaged with planning for Brexit to address potential challenges arising and

continued implementation of the White Paper reinforces the State’s preparedness in the

defence domain.

### 1. Introduction 

##### 1.1 Background

The current White Paper on Defence, which was approved by Government in July 2015,

provides the strategic and comprehensive defence policy framework for the period up to

2025.

The previous White Paper on Defence, which was published in 2000, was the first such white

paper in the history of this State. In 2013, given the passage of time and significant changes

in the security environment which had seen the emergence of new and complex transnational

threats, the Government initiated the preparation of a new White Paper through the

publication of a first ever Green Paper on Defence. This set out a range of policy questions

and sought submissions on Ireland’s future defence policy requirements.

In addition to consideration of 122 written submissions received in response to the Green

Paper, a process of widespread consultation was undertaken in the development of the

current White Paper. Discussions were held with a range of government departments and

state agencies on cross-cutting policy issues. The views of international organisations were

also obtained, with a particular focus on likely future trends in international peace support

operations. The Minister for Defence also hosted a symposium on the White Paper in May

2015 and this, coupled with Dáil statements in June 2015, provided a final opportunity for

inputs from stakeholders, prior to the finalisation of the White Paper. The White Paper is

[published on the Department of Defence website at www.defence.ie .](http://www.defence.ie/)

##### 1.2 Approach to the structure of the White Paper

In acknowledgement that security is the bedrock on which a society’s achievements are built,

the White Paper, at the outset, sets out a comprehensive and forward-looking assessment of

the dynamic security environment. This provides the context for the Government’s defence

policy response and it situates the defence contribution to security.

While a range of government departments and state agencies are responsible for leading and

planning for the response to the threats identified in the security assessment, the White

7


-----

Paper provides the policy framework for defence of the state from armed aggression, the

defence contribution to domestic security, including a wide range of day-to-day supports to

An Garda Síochána, and the defence contribution to international peace and security.

Furthermore, the defence contribution to cyber security, in support of the Department of

Communications, Climate Action and Environment, as well as other defence contributions to

major emergencies and crises, including the work of the Office of Emergency Planning, are all

set out. The White Paper also makes provision for other “non-security” policy requirements,

which maximise the utility of available defence assets, and overall value for money achieved

from defence expenditure, for the broader benefit of the State. All of these requirements are

reflected in the roles that Government specifically assigned to the Defence Forces in the

White Paper.

The White Paper commits to maintaining Ireland’s support for the United Nations (UN) and

to working closely with European partners in the ongoing development of the European

Union’s (EU) Common Security and Defence Policy (CSDP). It also states that Ireland will

continue to participate in the North Atlantic Treaty Organisation’s (NATO) Partnership for

Peace (PfP), which is instrumental in developing the interoperability that is necessary to

operate seamlessly alongside partners on overseas peace support and crisis management

operations. The White Paper does not change Ireland’s traditional policy of military neutrality

or the legal requirements governing the deployment of members of the Defence Forces

overseas.

The White Paper also sets out key capability decisions. Future capability requirements and

associated priorities are considered, particularly having regard to the types of operations that

the Defence Forces may be required to undertake in the years ahead. The development of

flexible and adaptive military capabilities is a pragmatic approach to dealing with future

uncertainty and the roles assigned. The White Paper also addresses a range of capability

issues such as “jointness” and, from an equipment perspective, identifies key equipment

replacement priorities. Human Resources are recognised as a key component of capability

and the White Paper sets out a comprehensive agenda for HR development. The White Paper

contains separate chapters dealing with both the Reserve Defence Force (RDF) and Civil

Defence and contains specific commitments in relation to each. The White Paper also

8


-----

introduces a number of new proposals, such as the development of an employment support

scheme, and includes a section dealing with Veterans and the support that the Veterans

Organisations receive from the Department of Defence and the Defence Forces.

##### 1.3 White Paper Update

One of the key new initiatives contained in the White Paper is a commitment by Government

to put in place a new fixed cycle of defence reviews, to be carried out on a three yearly cycle.

These reviews, which are common internationally, are intended to ensure that defence policy

remains up to date and to bring certainty and regularity to the process of defence planning

and overall preparedness. The first of these reviews is this White Paper Update, which in

accordance with the White Paper is to be followed by a more comprehensive Strategic

Defence Review.

The White Paper provides that these reviews are to consider progress made and any revisions

required. Further, these reviews are to encompass a fully updated assessment of the security

environment with a fresh consideration of implications for overall policy requirements,

associated tasks, capability development and resourcing. The Government, through the

White Paper, also committed to these review processes having new standing in public

management terms and that all-party consultation would take place, along with consideration

being given to placing these reviews on a statutory footing.

##### 1.4 Overview of Update process

The Update was led by the Minister with responsibility for Defence while the process was

managed by a high-level joint civil-military Steering Group. Beneath this, a Working Group

comprising civil and military representatives worked in support of the Steering Group.

The process undertaken to carry out this Update looked at three broad strands:

1. Security Environment assessment

2. Review of White Paper implementation

3. Consultation with the Joint Oireachtas Committee on Foreign Affairs and Trade, and

Defence

9


-----

Each of these strands forms a separate Chapter in this Update report and are covered in more

detail in the following Chapter Outline.

##### 1.5 Chapter Outline

**Chapter 2 - Developments in key aspects of the Security Environment since the White Paper**

**on Defence**

The 2015 White Paper on Defence (Chapter 2) contains an assessment of the security

environment that considered the broad security threats facing the State. This was done in

order to situate appropriately the defence policy response in terms of the lead or supporting

roles that defence plays. The updated security environment assessment has been carried out

by a high-level inter-departmental/inter-agency group. The group was led, at Assistant

Secretary level, by the Department of Defence and comprised representatives of the

Department of the Taoiseach, the Department of Justice and Equality, the Department of

Foreign Affairs and Trade, the Defence Forces, An Garda Síochána and the Department of

Communications, Climate Action and Environment.

The Chapter breaks down the updated security environment assessment into developments

in the global and regional security environment, the geopolitical environment and the

domestic security environment. In conducting this work, the Department of Defence has had

regard to the work of the Cabinet Committee on Security and has noted developments arising

from the Report of the Commission on the Future of Policing in Ireland, published in 2018.

The steps taken to establish a National Security Analysis Centre are very relevant in this

context.

**Chapter 3 - Review of White Paper Implementation**

Since publication of the White Paper, a total of 95 separate projects have been identified for

completion over a ten-year period. The White Paper implementation process has involved a

concerted project management led approach.

This Update includes a review of overall progress on all 95 White Paper implementation

projects broken down by their chapter in the White Paper and categorised based on their life

10


-----

cycle, from ‘initiated’ through to ‘closed’. This review used a sequenced four-stage process

to review the projects, moving from meetings with project sponsors through to a report

capturing the outcomes of each stage.

**Chapter 4 - Consultation with the Oireachtas**

The Minister with responsibility for Defence met with members of the Joint Oireachtas

Committee on Foreign Affairs and Trade, and Defence, on 5[th] March 2019 in relation to both

the White Paper Update and the process of establishing the fixed cycle of defence reviews.

This Chapter outlines the main issues raised and there is a full transcript of the meeting in

Appendix A.

**Chapter 5 - Developments since the White Paper 2015**

This Chapter encompasses issues and events that have occurred since the publication of the

White Paper on Defence in 2015.

**Chapter 6 - Conclusions**

This Chapter contains conclusions that have been drawn in relation to the main issues

arising from this Update and also from the process itself.

### 2. Developments in key aspects of the Security Environment since
 the White Paper on Defence 

##### 2.1 Introduction

The White Paper on Defence 2015 contained an assessment of the Security Environment,

which provided the context for the policy approach set out. As part of this White Paper

Update, the Security Environment assessment has been updated in order to provide an

overview of key developments and, in particular, to note changes that have occurred since

the White Paper was published.

In 2015, the White Paper identified the increasingly blurred boundaries between internal and

external security and highlighted that events in other countries can have significant

reverberations in Ireland. As such, a broader view of national security was taken in the

assessment of the Security Environment and nothing has changed in the meantime to merit

any narrowing of this view. Accordingly, in this review, which is a key element of this White

Paper Update, the broad security threats facing the State have been re-considered in the

context of changes and developments since 2015, internationally and domestically, that may

influence or have a bearing on the defence policy response in the years ahead. As a whole of

government approach, this review provides a common perspective for all elements of

government involved in the security of the State.

This review of the 2015 assessment is supported by information, including operational

intelligence and situational awareness, shared by a range of a government departments and

agencies which have key responsibilities in areas of national and international security. A

comprehensive cross-sectoral analysis of factual, relevant and reliable information has been

a key part of drawing this review together into one overall updated assessment of the current

and future security environment. Based on available information, there has been a

requirement to identify those areas which require continuing attention and those which for

a variety of reasons may be either of greater significance or have reduced in importance.

Security assessment brings with it the risk of over or under estimating the significance of

particular factors. In addition, the connectivity over time of different threats or events is not

12


-----

always straightforward. Human behaviour at inter-state, state, agency and individual level

combine to shape the world in which we live. Perceptions, of real as well as possible or

assumed threats, combine to create the overall picture. Capturing this very complex picture

will always be challenging given that there will always be a degree of subjectivity involved.

Moreover, as noted in 2015, the future security environment cannot be predicted with

certainty and there will always be unknown future threats. What may seem remote today can

quickly emerge as an immediate threat to the security of the State and its security interests

and, as such, gaps in our knowledge can often emerge in the form of strategic shocks that

have system-wide or transnational impact. It is important therefore that this updated

assessment of the security environment is considered with the reality of that uncertainty in

mind.

##### 2.2 Developments in the Global and Regional Security Environment 

_2.2.1 Overarching Nature of Conflict_

It is clear that the nature of conflict is continuing to evolve, but also that it has become

increasingly complex. This is not to say that the overall magnitude of the threat level faced

here in Ireland is necessarily greater than it was in 2015 but it is clear that new challenges,

some unforeseen, are emerging globally with increasing evidence of non-conventional

approaches being taken, and particularly so at state level. The security environment,

therefore, must be assessed in the context of its level of stability and the varying way that

threats may manifest themselves. These continue to evolve and an element of the security

picture is to identify vulnerabilities within this evolving picture. For example, the increased

blurring of the lines between inter-state conflict, terrorism and criminal activity, particularly

in the cyber domain, is now commonly characterised as hybrid warfare whereby state and

non-state actors may use conventional and high-end asymmetric methods concurrently

across the land, sea, air, cyber and space domains.

In 2015, it was noted that conflict zones and fragile states are breeding grounds for terrorism,

extremism and cross-border organised crime. Instability caused by fragile states continues to

have the potential to provoke broader conflicts while the organised crime landscape in the

EU is fundamentally affected by the geopolitical situation in and around Europe. The impact

13


-----

of conflicts on the periphery of the EU in Libya, Syria and Ukraine on serious and organised

crime in the EU has already materialised.

Conflict continues to involve a range of transnational, state, group and individual participants

who operate at global, regional and local levels both collectively and individually. In some

conflicts, there is concurrent inter-communal violence, terrorism, insurgency and criminality.

In recent years, particularly in Syria and Yemen, conflicts have led to huge numbers of civilian

casualties and caused catastrophic humanitarian crises. Since 2015, the use, by both state

and non-state actors, of explosive weapons in populated areas has become a growing

challenge. The use of such weapons in populated areas of Syria and Yemen has clearly been

with a view to making certain urban locations uninhabitable. The devastating effect of this on

civilians is not only with regard to the immediate impact of a sustained bombardment from

explosive weapons, but also the longer term and secondary effects from the destruction of

critical infrastructure and vital services. Such levels of destruction impede the economic,

social and environmental development of countries affected, long after conflict has ended.

As such, this represents a further dimension to the growing threat of ongoing regional

instability in affected areas. This has an impact on international crisis management

operations, including Irish participation in UN missions operating in these regions, and the

ability of peacekeeping forces to undertake the mandate assigned to them. It also has an

adverse impact in the operation of non-governmental organisations (NGOs), development

agencies and humanitarian workers in these conflict zones.

_2.2.2 The Hybrid Sphere_

Of particular concern to Ireland is the fact that hybrid activities have now become a significant

feature of the European security environment. The fact that the threats faced are increasingly

taking non-conventional forms is now a major security challenge. These are frequently state

led attacks and can be physical, such as new forms of terrorism, digital, through complex

cyber-attacks, or more subtle and aimed at the coercive application of pressure seeking to

undermine core values, such as human dignity, freedom and democracy.

14


-----

While definitions of hybrid threats vary, and need to remain flexible to respond to their

evolving nature, the concept captures the mixture of coercive and subversive activity,

conventional and unconventional methods (i.e. diplomatic, military, economic,

technological), which can be used in a coordinated manner by state or non-state actors to

achieve specific objectives, while remaining below the threshold of formally declared warfare.

The range of hybrid methods and activities is wide, with growing concerns over elections

being interfered with, disinformation campaigns, media manipulation, malicious cyber

activities and perpetrators of hybrid acts trying to radicalise vulnerable members of society

as their proxy actors. Concerns also abound around state led attacks on critical infrastructure,

economic and trade-related blackmail, and the undermining of international institutions.

Where such activity occurs, there is usually an emphasis on exploiting the vulnerabilities of

the target and on generating ambiguity to hinder decision-making processes. Hybrid

strategies are integrated, synchronised, and tailored to achieving a specific effect according

to the target. They involve centralised implementation or an effective coordination between

different levels of decision making. Hybrid attacks can be deniable and use a combination of

covert and overt means. The tactics are intentionally designed to create confusion and blur

the distinction between peace and war, making it difficult for the targets to respond in a

timely and efficient manner.

The level of hybrid activity is certainly increasing, as is Ireland’s response to it. As such, it is

important to avoid any potential complacency about how Ireland, as an EU member state,

may be the target of activity in this area, and particularly so if it is aimed at de-stabilising the

EU.

_2.2.3 Cyber Security_

In 2015, the White Paper noted that advances in technology will continue to present both

opportunities and threats. Societies are increasingly reliant on technology which underpins

basic functioning of many aspects of states, including critical national infrastructure. Our

increased reliance on technology in all facets of our lives and business processes has created

a potential vulnerability that can be exploited by those who have the means and knowledge

15


-----

to do so. As such, cyber security has become an increasingly mainstream concern in the last

number of years due to some very public incidents. These incidents have provided a very

visible reminder of the extent to which modern societies and economies depend on network

and information systems, including remote management, and of the vulnerability of these to

attack from a wide range of threat actors, ranging from states to criminals of various scales.

These seek to infiltrate and manipulate these systems towards their own ends and to gather

sensitive data. Moreover, the diverse nature of the incidents have shown how threat actors

in this space can use and develop attacks in combination with other tools, including military

force, disinformation and economic means – described above as hybrid activity. As such, the

complex and dynamic nature of security threats, vulnerabilities and consequences in the

cyber sphere are becoming increasingly clear - risks arise without regard for geography, and

in ways that challenge the abilities of states to detect and respond appropriately.

Cyber security is now central to the global security environment, and has given rise to a

diverse set of responses from states and international organisations. Many of these stress the

need for greater resilience of critical systems, as well as secure and rapid threat and

vulnerability information exchange. Allied to this is the need for coordinated national incident

response capacity and enhanced international efforts to institute new norms for state

behaviour online, and to address cyber crime.

Aspects that should not be overlooked in this analysis are developments in the area of

artificial intelligence and the fact that technological advancements are becoming a significant

aid, at state level, to military organisations, in terms of effective command and control, and

to law enforcement authorities in the fight against serious and organised crime. This includes

the use of advanced digital forensics tools.

_2.2.4 Terrorism_

Terrorism is one of the most profound challenges of our time, but defining terrorism is not

straightforward as there is no single internationally accepted definition. The University of

Maryland based authors of the Global Terrorism Database, however, define terrorism as “the

16


-----

threatened or actual use of illegal force and violence by a non-state actor to attain a political,

economic, religious, or social goal through fear, coercion, or intimidation.”[1]

No country is immune from the threat of terrorism, and no country can address the challenge

alone. As a basic headline indicator of the trend in terms of recorded terrorist incidents

worldwide, the situation is that in 2017 there were a total of 10,900 separate incidents,

compared to 13,587 in 2016 and 14,965 in 2015. In European terms, the number of such

incidents fell to 401 in 2017, from 407 in 2016 and 1,017 in 2015.[2]

Despite this overall downward trend in the number of incidents, member states of the EU

have been the target of repeated terror attacks since 2015. In 2018, a total of 129 foiled,

failed and completed terrorist attacks were reported by nine EU member states and these

resulted in the deaths of 13 victims. The number of attacks represented a decrease compared

to 2017 (205 terrorist attacks causing 68 deaths) and, a sharp spike in 2017 excepted, is in line

with an overall downward trend that started in 2014. While “ethno-nationalists” and

“separatists” continue to account for the largest proportion of attacks, all 13 fatalities in 2018

were as a result of so-called “jihadist terrorist attacks”. In its most recent EU Terrorism

Situation and Trend Report (2019), EUROPOL observed that all such attacks in 2018 were

committed by individuals acting alone and targeted civilians and symbols of authority.

EUROPOL commented that often the motivation of the perpetrator and the links to other

radicalised individuals or terrorist groups remained unclear and, furthermore, mental health

issues contributed to the complexity of the phenomenon.[3]

According to the UN Secretary General’s April 2018 Report on Activities of the UN system in

implementing the UN Global Counter-Terrorism Strategy: “The global fight against terrorism

is currently entering a new phase in which the international community has to confront

several parallel and interlinked global terror networks.” Investigations into the terrorist

attacks in Paris and Brussels, carried out in November 2015 and March 2016 respectively,

uncovered the involvement of some of the perpetrators in different types of serious and

-----

organised crime including drugs and firearms trafficking. The profit-driven nature of organised

crime activities is in many cases incompatible with terrorist acts, given the subsequent media

and law enforcement attention given to the perpetrators. However, the evidence of a cross
over between terrorism and organised crime is a growing cause of concern given the fast pace

of radicalisation, access to logistics and infrastructure associated with organised crime, and

the use of organised crime methods as a means to finance future terrorism related activities.

Following the rise of Islamic State in Iraq and the Levant (ISIL) after 2014, the international

community has faced a continuously transforming global terrorism landscape. Challenges to

countering terrorism are compounded by rapid developments in closed communications

technologies as terrorist groups quickly adapt and make use of these developments to

facilitate their financing, recruitment and propaganda. Experience has also shown that the

actions of “lone actors” using rudimentary means can also cause significant deaths and

injuries. Perpetrators of such attacks are frequently unconnected to a centralised terrorist

network, but have been self-radicalised through internet and social media based propaganda

that is targeted at those vulnerable to influence as a result of racism, social exclusion, mental

health and economic difficulties.

_2.2.5 Proliferation of Weapons_

The illegal and unregulated distribution of conventional weapons, including small arms,

continues to exacerbate conflicts in many regions of the world, including Africa. Such

weapons empower insurgents, extremists, pirates and criminal gangs, which can in turn

undermine the governance structures of fragile states. This was identified as an issue in 2015

and remains a key security challenge.

Concern also continues to remain about the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction and

missile technology. Thousands of such weapons exist and the risks increase where the

possibility arises that state authorities may lose control of parts of their missile and munitions

arsenal.

This concern increases where there is potential for terrorist groups to obtain Chemical,

Biological, Radiological and Nuclear (CBRN) weapons. Controlling access to materials and

18


-----

technology, from which such weapons could be manufactured, is a key security issue. Recent

years have seen a marked increase in the number of incidents where chemical weapons have

been used, in particular, since 2012. Their use has seriously threatened to undermine the

universal prohibition on the use of chemical weapons.

Furthermore, the use of chemical weapons, in an entirely civilian context, in the UK last year,

has served to demonstrate their lethal nature as well as the need to bolster a strong rules

based system that serves as a deterrent to any state that may actively facilitate or

surreptitiously countenance the use of such a deadly form of military technology. The strong

and united response of the international community, including Ireland, was an important and

clear signal of the level of shared abhorrence at the use of such chemical weapons in those

and any other circumstances.

In recent years, there has been a rapid advancement of Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV)

technology and the use of armed or strike enabled UAVs has become increasingly widespread.

The development and use of Lethal Autonomous Weapons Systems by some states, which

are putting increasingly significant resources into this technology, has also grown. The

development of these systems brings a new dimension to the area of weapons proliferation

and potential usage.

_2.2.6 Espionage_

There is increasing evidence internationally of the threat that espionage presents to the

sovereignty, national security and economic well-being of states. Espionage can involve the

presence of agents and proxies operating in or against a target state, including citizens who

are unaware of the true purpose of the activity and their role in it. It is also increasingly

intertwined with activity in the hybrid and cyber domains. This can encompass attempts to

influence policy to the disadvantage of the target state, to obtain confidential industrial

secrets and intellectual property, and to source technology (with potential use for military

purposes) as well as obtain “dual-use goods”[4] outright. Efforts by states to acquire restricted

materials or knowledge are quite sophisticated, often with several layers of deception in

4 Materials with an innocent application but which could be put to possible military use.

order to camouflage the intended end user and purpose, and to circumvent controls such as

sanctions, treaties, and international protocols.

In October 2018, the Dutch Government made public details of an attempted cyber-attack, in

April 2018, by the Russian GRU[5] on the Organisation for the Prevention of Chemical Weapons

(OPCW) which is based in The Hague. The Dutch authorities provided specific details of the

operation carried out and identification of the four individuals involved as GRU officers was

confirmed with supporting information obtained from phones and a laptop seized. The four

entered the Netherlands on Russian diplomatic passports. At the time of the attempted

attack, the OPCW was investigating the poisoning of Sergei Skripal and his daughter in

Salisbury (UK). It was also examining an alleged chemical attack in Syria by Russian-backed

Syrian forces. The Russian authorities deny any knowledge or involvement.

_2.2.7 Transnational Organised Crime_

The UN Convention against Transnational Organised Crime provides an internationally shared

definition of an organised criminal group as “a group of three or more persons existing over

a period of time acting in concert with the aim of committing crimes for financial or material

benefit.” Increasingly, however, geography is no longer a limiting factor in today’s security

environment and organised crime networks are operating on a transnational basis exploiting

free movement, free trade zones and well-developed transport infrastructure in the EU. It is

understood that there are now more than 5,000 such groups operating internationally who

are under investigation in the EU. Most of these are active in more than three countries and

an increasing number are involved in more than one criminal activity. Such activities include

drug smuggling, smuggling of migrants, human trafficking, money laundering and cybercrime

as well as counterfeiting activities. As noted in 2015, while organised crime is a global threat,

its effects can be felt locally and are a cause of significant suffering throughout the world,

including Ireland.

5 Despite a name change in 2010, the Russian military intelligence service is still commonly known by the
Russian acronym GRU (which stands for Main Intelligence Directorate).

_2.2.8 Climate Change_

Warming of the climate system is unequivocal. The fifth assessment report of the UN

Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC, 2013) concluded that there is at least a

95% probability that the global warming of the last 50 years is a result of human activity. The

Paris Agreement of December 2015 committed 195 countries, including Ireland, to the goal

of limiting the increase in global temperature to well below 2°C above pre-industrial levels.

However, it is important to note that even if this goal is met, the impact of climate change

will continue over the coming decades because of the delayed impacts of past and current

emissions.

The IPCC predicts more frequent hot and less frequent cold temperature extremes over most

land areas. According to the IPCC, the impacts of climate change will include a higher risk of

flooding and changes to crop yields. Global mean sea level is expected to continue to rise

during the 21[st] century due to increased ocean warming and increased loss of mass from

glaciers and ice sheets which will contribute to upward trends in extreme coastal high water

levels in the future.

Climate change is likely to result in increasingly violent weather patterns, drought and natural

disasters. This could aggravate existing water and food shortages and increase the likelihood

of regional instability, with resultant humanitarian and economic crises. Population growth

and migration flows will also be influenced by the effects of climate change. Globally, climate

change will see increased competition for scarce resources and may have devastating

consequences for many states on Europe’s periphery. In Europe, according to the European

Environment Agency (EEA), climate change can be seen as a threat multiplier that may

exacerbate existing trends, tensions and instability both within Europe and across European

borders. The Agency also notes that recent research suggests that an unprecedented drought

in the southern Mediterranean has been one of many drivers shaping local conflicts that

triggered the Syrian civil war, which ultimately led to the substantial increase in refugee flows

to Europe. The impacts of climate change on the Arctic region illustrate the multiple

21


-----

interactions between human security and geopolitical risks, even though they are not

currently associated with direct geopolitical conflicts.[6]

_2.2.9 Migration_

While migration has long been a global issue, it has struggled to find a place on the UN agenda

until recently. The 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development was a landmark in

acknowledging the “positive contribution of migrants” and setting an express target for safe,

orderly and regular migration. Following Ireland’s successful stewardship of the process

leading to the adoption of the 2030 Agenda and the Sustainable Development Goals in 2015,

Ireland co-facilitated the negotiations leading to agreement on the outcome for the UN

Summit held in September 2016 to address large movements of refugees and migrants. At

this Summit, governments adopted the New York Declaration for Refugees and Migrants.

This Declaration contained a series of commitments to address issues specific to large

numbers of people on the move, including a Comprehensive Refugee Response Framework

and created parallel processes for two Global Compacts; one on Refugees and one on Safe,

Orderly and Regular Migration.

The 2015 White Paper noted that Irish people have a long history of migrating and have

contributed positively to the growth and development of many countries. Ireland also

continues to benefit from the positive contribution made by people who have come from

abroad and settled in this State. Free movement of people between member states under the

EU treaties has also contributed positively to economic development.

Inward migration to the EU arises for various reasons including as a response to political

conflict, environmental or economic pressures. Changes observed since 2015 include the fact

that fewer people are now migrating as a result of conflict and, as such, the context has

changed somewhat. Compared to 2015, there has been a substantial decrease in numbers of

migrants detected entering the EU but large scale migration, both regular and irregular, will

continue to raise significant challenges for host countries and for the EU more generally.

6 EEA Report No 1/2017 – Climate change, impacts and vulnerability in Europe 2016.

22


-----

These challenges include how to ensure a fairer and more equitable distribution of migrants

across the Union, how this may impact on existing policies and structures including the

Common European Asylum System and Schengen, concerns about economic impacts, and the

rise of far-right and anti-immigration movements in parts of the EU that seek to generate and

exploit disproportionate anxieties about the potential impact of inward migration on

domestic security.

As noted in 2015, according to the UN Office on Drugs and Crime, the smuggling of migrants

is a highly profitable business in which criminals enjoy low risk of detection and punishment.[7]

As a result, the crime is becoming increasingly attractive to criminals and organised crime

syndicates in particular. Furthermore, the distinction between the smuggling of migrants and

human trafficking is often very subtle and sometimes they overlap. The migration crisis has

resulted in an increase in the number of potential victims of human trafficking. In recent

years, the traditional human trafficking flow from Eastern Europe to Western Europe has

been replaced by multiple and diverse flows all over the EU. A growing number of vulnerable

adults and unaccompanied minors in the EU are likely to be targeted by traffickers who,

facilitated by weak governance, work closely with transnational organised criminal groups.

_2.2.10 Globalisation_

As noted in 2015, as a small open economy, Ireland benefits from globalisation and is more

closely linked and inter-dependent on others than ever before. At the same time, it was stated

that Ireland is exposed to all of the dangers, uncertainties and challenges in the wider defence

and security environment that accompany globalisation. Since then, the challenges and

uncertainties have increased and become more complex. To an extent not observed in 2015,

the UN led framework of multilateral cooperation and collective security, globally and in

Europe, is now at risk. This has implications across the spectrum but particularly for climate,

trade and prosperity, and for security. There are indications that developing trade disputes

could have damaging repercussions for global trade and investment flows overseen by the

World Trade Organisation; doing further harm to other states’ faith in global cooperation and

7 http://www.unodc.org/unodc/en/human-trafficking/migrant-smuggling-a-deadly-business.html

23


-----

multilateralism. Such a polarisation, were it to become widespread, would serve to raise

concerns about global and regional security.

Nevertheless, a more positive consequence of the shift on the part of some away from

multilateral cooperation and collective security has been a re-doubling of effort on the part

of Ireland and others to preserve and, where necessary, reform approaches to international

cooperation. Strong continuing commitments on the part of the EU and the bulk of the

international community to the Paris Agreement on climate change and the Iran nuclear deal

are examples of this.

Ireland is highly dependent on external trade links and is reliant on the unimpeded movement

of goods for our economic well-being. Any potential disruption or change to this pattern of

movement of goods or services is a concern for Irish businesses seeking to access new and

existing markets. In 2015, it was noted that as an island nation, Ireland is highly reliant on sea

transport routes, particularly via the United Kingdom, for the import and export of goods and

for essential supplies. The high reliance on these transport links presents a potential

vulnerability that has been amplified by the UK’s decision to leave the EU.

_2.2.11 EU Global Strategy on Foreign and Security Policy_

In 2015, the White Paper noted that a new European Foreign and Security Policy Strategy may

give rise to different focal points, requirements and responses, and that Ireland will

contribute to the development of these strategies and policies in order to ensure that our

values and interests are fully considered.

Subsequently, the EU’s Global Strategy on Foreign and Security Policy was adopted in June

2016. Its five priority themes are (i) security and defence, (ii) building resilience of states and

societies, (iii) an integrated approach to conflicts and crises, (iv) support for cooperative

regional orders and (v) supporting global governance. The Strategy has a positive focus on the

Middle East Peace Process, disarmament, gender, the UN and importance of multilateralism

more generally.

24


-----

Since its adoption, implementation has focused on security and defence, resilience and the

integrated approach. A priority in the time ahead will be the EU’s work in support of global

governance, multilateralism and the UN. Strengthening the EU's peace-keeping and crisis
management capacity in support of the UN will be an integral part of implementing the Global

Strategy and will be done through the further development of the CSDP, as defined in the EU

Treaties, including through greater cooperation and coordination between military and

civilian CSDP Missions and Operations.

_2.2.12 Economic Developments_

The 2015 White Paper observed that the balance of economic power is expected to shift over

the next half century with those countries with emerging growing economies accounting for

an ever-increasing share of economic output. The Organisation for Economic Co-operation

and Development (OECD) forecasts that a consequence of the rising importance of emerging

markets in the world economy, notably China and India, but also Indonesia, is that the centre

of gravity of world economic activity will continue to move from North America and Europe

toward Asia.[8] Running alongside this economic shift is the rise of Asian, and in particular

Chinese, influence in other regions. With a population of 1.3 billion, China is the world’s

second largest economy and is increasingly playing an important and influential role in

development and in the global economy. China has been the largest single contributor to

world growth since the global financial crisis of 2008.[9]

Growth in defence spending has continued in some Asian states, which have expanded their

military capabilities. As noted in 2015, the associated re-balancing of global military forces

can increase the risks associated with existing inter-state rivalries, including those relating to

contested territories. While the Paper noted that, in the period 2006 to 2012, defence

spending across EU member states had declined in real terms, the latest Eurostat figures

indicate that this trend stabilised in 2015, 2016 and 2017.[10] In noting this trend, security is

dependent on a variety of elements of which appropriate levels of defence are relevant. In

considering threats, the defence component sits within a broader international framework

-----

which should seek to reinforce security overall and avoid any suggestion of an approach which

goes beyond protection of the international order and relevant interests.

_2.2.13 Emergencies and Natural Disasters_

As was noted in 2015, not all emergencies constitute a national security concern and are well

provided for within emergency planning fora. However, emergencies can occur that have the

potential to cause serious and protracted disruption to the functioning of a state and

adversely affect its citizens. These could include severe weather events, pandemics or other

natural disasters.

The Sendai Framework for Disaster Risk Reduction 2015-2030, was adopted by 187 states,

including Ireland, at the conclusion of the Third UN World Conference on Disaster Risk

Reduction (DRR), held in Sendai, Japan in March 2015. The Sendai Framework is the global

blueprint for disaster risk reduction up to 2030.

_2.2.14 Energy Security_

EU countries’ dependency on energy imports increased from 40% of gross energy

consumption in the 1980s to reach 55.1% by 2017.[11] Projections indicate that the EU will

import 77% of its energy by 2030. Europe will therefore become increasingly dependent on

the rest of the world for its energy supplies – with much of its oil being sourced from Europe’s

surrounding arc of instability from North and West Africa to the Middle East and Eurasia. As

noted in 2015, uninterrupted energy supplies are a key factor in both EU and Irish security,

and require stable, well-functioning suppliers. Ensuring the stability of these states may

require long-term international assistance. Changing global energy dynamics, and threats to

the EU’s energy security, have given greater impetus to the development of the EU’s energy

diplomacy and to efforts to strengthen European energy security. The publication of the EU

Energy Security Strategy in May 2014 is an important development in this regard.

-----

_2.2.15 Resource Scarcity_

Insecurity in the global food chain will continue to impact on all states, and not just on those

that directly experience climate change. Feeding the Earth’s population in a context of rapid

urbanisation and changing consumption preferences will require an increase of up to 70% in

global food production by 2050, at a time of declining resource availability and severe climate

stress and volatility. Even now, when global food production is sufficient to feed the world’s

population, nearly one billion people suffer from hunger and under-nutrition due to several

factors including: inadequate incomes, vulnerable livelihoods, an estimated 30-50% in food

losses throughout the global food chain and geo-political challenges leading to poorly

distributed intensification of food production. Furthermore, 1.6 billion people live in countries

and regions with absolute water scarcity and this number is expected to rise to 2.8 billion

people by 2025. A particular cause for concern is that terrorists, international criminal

organisations, and militants may be in a position to use the scarcity of resources to promote

their own interests, and, by doing so, undermine affected governments.

##### 2.3 Developments in the Geopolitical Environment 

In 2015, the White Paper noted that following a period of apparent stability, new and serious

conflicts had erupted adjacent to the EU which challenged perceptions about the stability of

the broader European region. The suddenness at which these crises arose highlighted the

unpredictability of the security environment and reignited concerns not seen since the end of

the cold war. The instigation of actions that threaten and impact on security at global and

European level remain an on-going cause for concern. A more variable global setting in which

multilateral approaches are not always consistently pursued may contrive to generate

additional uncertainty and enhance a context that is more permissive to aggressive

behaviours in the security environment.

While conflict and tensions in Eastern Europe, the Middle East, Asia, Africa and elsewhere

continue to challenge international peace and security, it remains the case that the

probability of a conventional military attack on Ireland is low. However, as in 2015, conflicts

affecting member states of the EU present serious concerns for Ireland and the future outlook

remains unpredictable. Uncertainty over the future shape of the external environment, with

the continued evolution of non-conventional hybrid threats, remains a concern.

27


-----

The dynamic for the EU has changed. While continuing to present for the world a firm

commitment to democratic values based on multilateralism and treaty-bound commitments,

the political landscape has at times seemed to cast doubt on the resilience and benefits of

this approach for all. The rise of more extremist political forces along with some continuing

economic pressures has challenged the EU to maintain its full force in being a pole of

attraction for enhancement and promotion of peace and stability.

Tensions continue in this neighbourhood within and between some states that were formerly

part of the Soviet Union. Certain states have sought greater integration with the West and

others continue to remain oriented towards Russia. Russia encourages these ties through

various measures, including political, economic and security means. The ongoing conflict in

Eastern Ukraine and the illegal annexation of the Autonomous Republic of Crimea and the

City of Sevastopol by Russia have illustrated the potential for the escalation of military

confrontation in the region. As an indication of associated concerns, in 2016 NATO member

states agreed at the Warsaw summit to enhance its forward presence in Eastern Europe with

four multi-national battalion-size battlegroups in Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania and Poland.

Tensions between Russia and Georgia regarding the breakaway regions of Abkhazia and South

Ossetia and the dispute between Armenia and Azerbaijan over Nagorno-Karabakh continue

to threaten to undermine peace and stability in the region. In the Western Balkans, the efforts

of the international community have contributed to the ongoing stability. However, problems

and clear challenges remain, which need to be addressed, building on the security achieved

so far.

In terms of Brexit, both the EU and the UK share the same security and defence interests and

both are committed to the establishment of the necessary mechanisms to work closely

together following the UK’s signalled departure from the EU. Both the UK and the EU are

committed to the UK remaining firmly part of Europe and in a reciprocal way continuing to be

an important part of the EU’s security.

The situation in the Middle East is expected to remain volatile for the foreseeable future and

it is reasonable to conclude that current conflicts have little chance of reaching a quick

28


-----

resolution. The protracted Israeli-Palestinian conflict will continue to fuel resentment across

the broader region, and other internal and regional conflicts and diplomatic disputes will also

continue to impact on security in the region and beyond.

In spite of the territorial defeat of ISIS in Iraq and Syria, the security situation in Syria, Iraq,

Yemen and Libya and the strength of extremist groups in each country are also likely to play

a major part in the evolution of the transnational terrorist threat over the next ten years. The

number of foreign fighters from all parts of the world currently operating in that region makes

it likely that new terrorist groups and networks will be formed. These groups continue to have

a destabilising effect on the region and this trend is likely to continue. There are also concerns

that the EU nationals who have already engaged in conflict in Syria and Iraq may contribute

to the evolution of the transnational terrorist threat to EU nations. The security situation in

Afghanistan is also a concern. The Taliban remain the main threat, but attacks in recent years

have demonstrated the continued and increasing threat to Afghanistan posed by ISIS. The

chances of concrete peace negotiations, and a substantial improvement in the security

situation, remain slim in the short term. Renewed threats to the nuclear agreement with Iran

may also lessen regional stability.

The instability arising from the recent uprisings in North Africa and the Middle East is likely to

continue for some time due to the failure to satisfy the ‘Arab Spring generation’ and the

tightening or closing down on political space for civil society and advocates of democratic

change. This will also fuel migration, as recently seen in the Mediterranean, and the increasing

risk of marginalisation of ethnic or religious minorities. It may also contribute to a potential

growth in support for radical groups. A range of governance failures will also exacerbate

security issues in the coming years leading to increased risks associated with ungoverned

spaces. Indeed, this trend is already visible in the region.

Sub-Saharan Africa (SSA) will continue to suffer the impact of profound and chronic instability,

driven by state failure, poor governance and corruption in three main regions; the Horn of

Africa, across the Sahel and the Great Lakes region. In areas where the State is weak,

organised crime and terrorism networks are often interconnected. Further growth in

extremism is likely to be apparent over the next decade. Countries such as Mali, Sudan,

29


-----

Nigeria, Somalia and the Central Africa Republic already have significant issues with extremist

groups. Organised crime in human and drug trafficking, and wildlife poaching is likely to

continue to be a feature.

With high levels of youth unemployment at a time when 70% of the population is under 35 in

most SSA countries, political unrest and instability is a considerable risk in the coming

decades. Competition for resources is also likely to fuel regional conflict in the Great Lakes

and across the continent.

Weak governance structures and an increasing threat from non-state actors will continue to

threaten the stability in some areas of the Central and South Asian region. The development

by North Korea of nuclear weapons, increased military spending, along with territorial

disputes, are a cause of concern.

The Arctic has also become the focus of renewed geopolitical, economic, academic and

environmental interest due to the melting of the polar icecap, combined with progress in

offshore capabilities.

##### 2.4 Developments in the Domestic Security Environment 

_2.4.1 Domestic Terrorism_

The Good Friday and subsequent agreements continue to underpin a stable peace process

that commands overwhelming cross community support, although there are challenges in

securing agreement between the parties in Northern Ireland in order to form a new Executive.

However, there remains a real and persistent threat from paramilitary groups who are

prepared to use violence in order to oppose democracy and peace. The level of threat from

these groups is reviewed on an ongoing and active basis. While the threat of an attack in the

State is generally considered to be low, these groups carry out planning and preparatory

activities for attacks in Northern Ireland, where the threat is classified as severe. The State

has a strong commitment to counter any such activities aimed at undermining peace and

prosperity on this island.

30


-----

The authorities here and in Northern Ireland, working jointly and individually against these

paramilitary groups, have disrupted their activities and secured convictions in the courts. An

increased factionalisation among these groups is apparent in recent years. While this can

weaken their coherence, it can potentially lead to greater volatility in the small groupings.

Moreover, inextricable links have developed between the paramilitary groups and organised

crime. They are heavily involved with criminal gangs in the drugs trade; they engage in

extortion and smuggling; they are also known to provide expertise and firearms to criminal

gangs.

In the context of Brexit, the commitments made by the Irish and British Governments and the

EU, including in the area of rights, will be fundamental to ensuring an outcome that sustains

the achievements of the peace process and provides no advantage to the violent objectives

and actions of paramilitary groups on the island of Ireland.

_2.4.2 International Terrorism_

As outlined in 2015, the threat to Ireland as a target of international terrorism remains under

constant review, taking into account developing security threats including identified common

risks that arise for western democracies generally. The experience in other European

countries has shown that the threat level can escalate rapidly and the source and intensity of

that threat can differ. A threat can also emerge suddenly as a result of factors that lie outside

the control of Government. Events such as these are a continuing concern.

In 2015, concern was identified about self-radicalised individuals acting alone – often referred

to as “lone actors”. Since the White Paper was published in 2015, terrorist attacks in Paris,

Brussels, Nice, Munich, Berlin, London, Stockholm, Manchester and Barcelona have, amongst

others, provided stark examples of the lethal threat experienced and faced by European

states. The frequently unsophisticated nature of such attacks highlight the challenges that

face security authorities in seeking to prevent atrocities of this nature. Moreover, it is

apparent that these types of attacks can inspire subsequent plots by other “lone actors” or

very small groups of radicalised individuals who, because they may be “home-grown” and

have not travelled to, or returned from, conflict zones, may not be directly connected to any

terrorist network and be unknown to the intelligence services.

31


-----

In this context, there is continuing concern about the process of radicalisation and the range

of influences, including the internet, which can enable this process. Overall, while the

potential source of the threat to this State from international terrorism has evolved, the

threat level has remained unchanged since 2015 and Ireland also continues to have a

responsibility to seek to prevent transnational terrorist groups from using the State as a

refuge or as a base from which to direct their activities against targets in other countries.

As noted in 2015, Ireland has always engaged actively, through the EU, UN and other

international bodies, in crisis management and in tackling the root causes of instability. This

proactive approach mitigates security risks in the international environment, which is in

Ireland’s interest. UN and UN-mandated missions, including military missions, are among the

instruments used by the international community in the collective security response. Active

engagement by Ireland in this collective response can lead, on occasion, to an increase in the

threat to Ireland directly or by association, without, necessarily always, significantly altering

the general security environment that Ireland faces.

Ireland along with other democracies puts a premium on societal freedoms and seeks to

ensure that in its responses to threats that actions taken do not of themselves work counter

to the cherished rights of its citizens. Threats to a fully functioning democratic society are

therefore considered in this wider context and the aims of those behind such threats factored

into the relevant analysis and ultimately responses.

_2.4.3 Cyber Domain_

In 2015, the White Paper noted that Ireland, like most of Europe, has highly developed

infrastructure that is in many cases dependent on information and communication

technologies (ICT). Critical national infrastructure such as energy, water, social welfare,

telecommunications, banking and healthcare are dependent on ICT not just to operate

effectively, but to operate at all. Cyber security risks exist for government and public utilities

as well as for commercial entities and individuals.

The State has adapted to this, like many others, by both building capacity and systems to

respond to incidents as and when they occur, and by taking measures to improve the

32


-----

resilience of critical national infrastructure and services. The former is embodied in the

growth and development of the National Cyber Security Centre, the latter in the Network and

Information Regulations 2018, which compels Critical National Infrastructure Operators to

take a series of measures to protect their systems.

The centrality of network and information technology issues to the global security

environment notwithstanding, the unique concentration of major technology companies in

Ireland underscores the importance of coordinated systems of resilience to protect the

economic and social well-being of the State and its citizens.

_2.4.4 Organised Crime_

The cross-over between organised crime and subversive paramilitaries was noted in 2015,

particularly in the context of the use of improvised explosive devices by criminals within the

State. As noted above, the links between both have continued to increase in recent years and

have contributed to the factionalisation that has occurred within republican paramilitary

groups.

There continues to be a growing connectedness between domestic organised crime groups

and networks across Europe and further afield that are involved in a wide range of

transnational criminal activities including drug smuggling, money laundering, fraud and

human trafficking. Through these connections, there has been a noted increase in the volume

of firearms coming into the possession of organised crime groups in this State. Ireland

continues to play its role in international action to combat the activities of transnational

organised crime, including through operational co-operation by the Naval Service, An Garda

Síochána and Revenue in drugs interdiction in the maritime domain both bilaterally with

partner states and through MAOC-N.[12]

12 Maritime Analysis and Operations Centre - Narcotics (MAOC-N) is a Lisbon based agency established to combat
transatlantic drug trafficking, by air and sea, to Europe and the West African seaboard. Ireland and six other EU
member states participate in MAOC-N.

33


-----

_2.4.5 Espionage_

A developing factor in the domestic security environment is the threat to national security

and economic well-being from espionage in the form of the clandestine activities by hostile

states, including by their intelligence officers. Such activity is known to be multi-faceted and

may involve cultivating sources with a view to intelligence gathering and gaining protected,

sensitive information relating to this State, as well as to international institutions and external

organisations to which Ireland is affiliated. Furthermore, the potential repercussions of

espionage activities on the confidence of foreign direct investment in Ireland has potential to

affect our economic development. This State will continue to take preventative measures to

safeguard our sovereignty, national security and economic well-being from espionage

activities that are hostile to our interests.

_2.4.6 Energy Security_

The commencement of production from the Corrib gas field at end 2015, which is now

operating at full capacity, reduced Ireland’s overall energy import dependency in 2016 from

90% to 70%, a significant improvement in security of supply. Currently almost 60% of Ireland’s

natural gas needs are met by indigenous production. However, the Kinsale fields (Kinsale

Head, Ballycotton and Seven Heads) are expected to cease production by 2021, and by

2025/26 Corrib gas supplies will have declined to less than 40% of initial peak production

levels. The anticipated reduction in Corrib and Inch gas supplies will mean that connections

to international networks will remain key in terms of energy security. Post-Brexit, Ireland and

the EU will become increasingly reliant on non-EU sources of energy (UK, Norway, Russia,

Middle-East). Over the course of the next decade, it is likely that further electricity

interconnection to the UK and to France will be built. Ireland’s energy security is therefore

heavily reliant on a relatively small number of vital installations, both onshore and sub-sea.

As Ireland continues to decarbonise its electricity system, offshore wind installations will be

developed, initially in the shallower waters in the Irish Sea by mid-2020s with floating wind

technologies deployed off the west coast later in the decade.

34


-----

_2.4.7 Maritime Domain and the Illegal exploitation of natural resources and security of_

_offshore infrastructure_

As noted in 2015, being an island, many of the risks and threats listed in the EU Maritime

Security Strategy are relevant to Ireland’s maritime domain. This includes threats to Ireland’s

economic resources arising from illegal, unreported and unregulated fishing or other illegal

exploitation of Ireland’s maritime resources and has the potential to deplete fish stocks and

destroy marine habitats.

The development of off-shore renewable energy technology will lead to an increased focus

on maritime based energy systems in the coming years, and the future development of

infrastructure will need to be monitored. Whilst the current threat to existing infrastructure

is assessed as low, the security challenges that could be posed in the event of a change in the

threat assessment will also need to be continuously reviewed.

A continuing feature of the wider domestic security environment is the possible security

implications arising from foreign military air or maritime activity in the vicinity of Ireland. Such

activity, while not necessarily constituting a direct threat to this State, can raise tensions and

may have an undermining effect on security overall.

_2.4.8 Natural Disasters_

In 2015, the White Paper noted that Ireland’s geographic position does not pre-dispose us to

the same level of risk of natural disasters as many other countries. However, the effects of

climate change are continuing to lead to changes in weather patterns and an increased

probability that severe weather events such as flooding could become more common-place

in Ireland.

The possibility of a pandemic, caused by influenza and other diseases, remains an ongoing

concern with the potential to cause serious disruption to society. Animal infectious diseases

such as Foot and Mouth disease also have the potential to cause significant economic loss.

35


-----

##### 2.5 Policy Implications

The threats set out in this updated assessment of the security environment, as contained in

Chapter 2 of the White Paper on Defence 2015, will continue to require a broad policy

response with policy lead roles resting in a variety of government departments and agencies.

Defence policy is one aspect of this broader policy response and the implications of the

changes outlined in this review will be considered in the context of overall defence policy

requirements, and with regard to the other elements of work carried out as part of the White

Paper Update.

36

### 3. Review of White Paper Implementation

##### 3.1 Overview of approach to White Paper implementation 

The 2015 White Paper on Defence sets the defence policy agenda over a ten year planning

horizon and covers all aspects of defence within overall security policy. In this regard, it

encompasses all work carried out by the Department of Defence, the Defence Forces, Civil

Defence and other organisations with responsibilities in this area. It comprehends the

Government’s policy on defence of the State from armed aggression, the defence

contribution to domestic security, the defence contribution to international peace and

security and a broad range of other “non-security” roles which the Government require the

Defence Forces and Civil Defence to undertake. It considers the defence capabilities required

so that the Defence Forces can successfully deliver on the roles assigned by Government.

Finally, the White Paper also considers implementation and the actions required to ensure

that defence planning and provision processes are further developed through a new fixed

cycle of defence reviews process and a specific defence funding study.

During scoping of the White Paper implementation programme, a total of 88 actions or

projects were specifically identified along with seven sub-projects in the capability

development area. As the projects are implemented, projects may be sub-divided

augmenting the numbers so currently the number to be implemented stands at 95 and this

number will be subject to further change as the process evolves. Implementation of these

specific actions is being carried out on a phased basis over a ten-year period out to 2025.

Implementation on a phased basis is necessary in order to reflect Programme for a

Partnership Government and Strategy Statement commitments, the related nature of some

projects and resourcing implications. This process is being kept under review and will be

subject to change as issues arise and other business dictates. Appendix B contains a table

that provides summary statistics reflecting the current position in relation to White Paper

implementation.

A decision was made by the Secretary General and Chief of Staff in 2015 that in order to

ensure that these projects were implemented over the ten year horizon, a Project

Management approach would be adopted in this regard with joint civil-military teams being

37


-----

established for each project as it was initiated. In effect, a Change Management process was

initiated to enable and support the effective implementation to the White Paper. A Joint Civil

Military White Paper Implementation Facilitation Team (Joint Team) was set up to provide

support and monitor the progress of these White Paper projects.

The Joint Team is a civil-military team which operates in an oversight capacity and supports

the facilitation of learning and knowledge sharing across the Defence Organisation[13] through

the civil-military project teams. The Joint Team reports monthly on the progress of

implementation to the Organisation’s Strategic Management Committee (SMC) as part of the

governance framework put in place to oversee implementation and to embed a Project

Management approach to implementation. The Joint Team also worked closely with the SMC

and the Institute of Public Administration (IPA) in relation to the creation and roll out of

tailored Project Management documentation and training to the Defence Organisation. To

date over 150 people in the Organisation have undergone Project Management training

delivered by the IPA in conjunction with the Joint Team. This training programme continues

to be rolled out with relevant updates provided to project team members at regular intervals.

Arising from the Defence experience with the introduction of Project Management in a civil
military environment, the Organisation was asked to lead on Action 10 of Our Public Services

_2020[14] to Embed Programme and Project Management in the Public Service. A public service_

inter-agency Action Team, led by the Defence Organisation, has been active since mid-2018

and enables effective inter-departmental and agency collaboration and learning in the

Programme and Project Management space.

A total of 42 White Paper projects have been initiated since the beginning of the

implementation programme and of these 15 projects have been fully completed and closed,

with several others due to close shortly.

13 The term Defence Organisation refers to the Department of Defence and the Defence Forces.
14 _Our Public Service 2020 is a framework that establishes the overall strategy for development and innovation_
in the Public Service to 2020 and beyond.

##### 3.2 Overview of approach to the review of White Paper projects 

The purpose of this element of the Update was to consider the progress on all 95 White Paper

projects.

To facilitate a programme-led approach, the projects review process was carried out through

a categorisation of all projects, as either: Active; Paused; Tranche 2[15]; Merged; Not Initiated;

or Closed. Depending on the status of the project, different considerations arising were

factored into the review process.

It was agreed that this element of the Update would proceed through the following sequenced

four stages.

1. Joint meetings of Project Sponsors (relevant members of the Department’s Management

Board and General Staff)

2. Joint meetings of Project Sponsors with Project Leads

3. Specific Project appraisal exercises as agreed by the Project Sponsors

4. Report prepared capturing outcomes of these assessments

**Stage 1 – Joint meetings of Project Sponsors**

The purpose of these meetings was for the civil and military sponsors of all 95 projects to

jointly arrange for and mandate certain specific work to follow. It was essentially to ensure

clarity and common communications  to respective civil and military project team personnel.

Sponsors met according to the project categories and took a preliminary view of new

influences relevant to each project and, if necessary, held these for discussion with the

Project Leads in the next element of the sequence. Such influences involved specific wider

environmental factors unique to a particular project, new policy developments arising since

the project commenced, specific resource considerations arising for the project, particular

new linkages or connections that have emerged across projects and any other points

considered relevant by the sponsors.

15 Tranche 2 refers to the second wave of projects that were approved for commencement, from 2018, by the
Minister with responsibility for Defence.

39


-----

**Stage 2 - Joint meetings of Project Sponsors with Project Leads**

Stage 2 involved meetings between the Sponsors and Leads which, in the case of the 18

projects selected for further discussion following Stage 1, considered each relevant project

according to its present status and addressed the issues and any relevant influencing factors

determined as being relevant at the Stage 1 meetings.

**Stage 3 - Specific Project appraisal exercises as agreed by the Project Sponsors**

Prior to commencement of the projects review, it was agreed that arising from the previous

phase of consideration, Project Leads or Teams may be asked to undertake a particular

exercise or report back on specific aspects of their own project. Alternatively, at this stage,

P&O Branch and SPB may have been asked to consider particular issues in conjunction with

individual project teams in some cases in conjunction with the WP Joint Team. In the

circumstances, at Stage 2, the project sponsors considered whether there were any issues

that warranted such further consideration at Stage 3, but agreed in each of the 18 cases that

there was no requirement for a Stage 3 review.

**Stage 4 - Report prepared capturing outcomes of these assessments**

The final stage of the review process provided for preparation of a Report, in consultation

with the sponsors, capturing the outcomes of the work done under various headings. It was

agreed that, in form, this Report was to follow the White Paper chapter structure and the

project categorisation governing this overall project review phase. This Report is intended

to provide a context, and aggregated view of projects, with which other elements of the

White Paper Update (e.g. the outputs of the updated assessment of the security

environment) can be considered and conclusions developed. This Report will provide the

basis for its next phase of overall work which, inter alia, will consider the case for change in

the overall context provided by the updated security environment assessment and the views

of the Oireachtas Committee.

Appendix C contains a full list of all 95 White Paper projects while Appendix D contains a full

report, on a chapter by chapter basis, of the outcome of this review of implementation in

respect of each project. The following pages provide a summary of the outcome of this

element of the White Paper Update.

40


-----

##### 3.3 Review of Chapter 3 Projects: National Security - Defence Policy Response

Chapter 3 of the White Paper considers the defence policy requirements having regard to the

assessment of the Security Environment set out in its second chapter. That assessment

highlighted the importance of collective security responses and, as the domestic and

international security spheres have a broad range of policy actors, there is a significant cross

cutting policy dimension to this chapter of the White Paper.

The assessment of the Security Environment highlighted the importance of such collective

security responses to meet the complexities of new and emerging threats to international

peace and security. As such, the chapter contains specific commitments, that became White

Paper projects, to engage proactively with the UN, the EU, the Organization for Security and

Co-operation in Europe (OSCE) and NATO PfP and other states with a view to developing and

deepening relationships to this end. This includes a proposal to evaluate a new concept

involving the potential development of a new Institute for Peace Support and Leadership

Training in the Defence Forces Training Centre (project number 8).

The chapter also commits that the Defence Organisation will continue to provide inputs to

domestic security, including providing supports to An Garda Síochána and supports to other

government departments and agencies in areas such as fisheries protection and cyber

security. In relation to the latter, one of the commitments made in this chapter was the

development of a Service Level Agreement (SLA), which has since been completed, with the

Department of Communications, Climate Action and Environment (project number 12). This

SLA commits to providing support, as resources allow, to the National Cyber Security Centre.

In total, there were 12 projects from this chapter that were reviewed as part of this element

of the Update, including three that are now closed. More detail is contained in the report at

Appendix D but, in summary, there are no significant changes to the approach to

implementation arising from the review of commitments contained in this chapter. Notably,

however, developments arising from the Report of the Commission on the Future of Policing

in Ireland, published in 2018, and subsequent steps taken to establish a National Security

Analysis Centre, are very relevant to the requirement for ongoing monitoring of the security

environment and associated arrangements (project number 1). External engagement will

41


-----

continue in relation to the evolving approach to the assessment of security and associated

arrangements.

##### 3.4  Review of Chapter 4 Projects: Other Policy Requirements

While security roles underpin the raison d’être of the Defence Forces, the Government also

require the Defence Forces to undertake a broad range of non-security related roles. This

facilitates the elimination of duplication of service provision by the State and promotes

enduring savings to the exchequer. This chapter provides that the Defence Forces will

continue to provide support to other departments and agencies, across a broad range of non
security related roles. Where such supports are provided on an ongoing basis, or where as a

contingency it is envisaged that there will be a specific role for the Defence Forces in certain

types of emergency, the Department of Defence will continue to seek to agree SLAs with

relevant departments and agencies to ensure that there is clarity on all sides about the roles

of all parties and call-out protocols.

All projects arising from commitments made in this chapter were reviewed as part of this

element of the Update, including one that is now closed (number 22). This relates to a

proposal contained in the White Paper for the direct involvement of the Defence Forces in a

new employment support scheme to be developed between the Department of Defence, the

Defence Forces and the then Department of Social Protection. The review noted that the

outcome of a recent (separate) review of the scheme, which has been very successfully

implemented, was that it should be continued on the basis of one iteration annually.

More detail is contained in the report at Appendix D but, amongst the other key projects

reviewed as part of this element of the Update, was the project aimed at developing a policy

on intellectual property rights and endorsement (number 19), which has recently been

finalised and closed and which, it was noted, will enable commencement of two related

projects which are concerned with collaboration between the Defence Forces and Irish based

enterprise (number 17 (merged with 21)) and the Defence Enterprise Initiative (number 18),

which are both currently paused.

42


-----

##### 3.5  Review of Chapter 6 Projects: Capability Requirements

As the future security environment is uncertain, and the type of operations that the Defence

Forces may be required to undertake can change significantly as new threats emerge,

capabilities must therefore be developed and maintained to meet the challenges of a dynamic

security environment. This chapter of the White Paper addresses capability issues whilst

recognising that there is a requirement to adopt a flexible and responsive approach. It sets

out key principles in capability development, including jointness, and the major equipment

projects to be implemented for the Army, Air Corps and Naval Service, as well as priorities in

the event of additional funding becoming available. The chapter also considers infrastructure

and the provision of medical services.

All projects arising from commitments made in this chapter were reviewed as part of this

element of the Update and details are contained in Appendix D. In terms of the review of

progress with the ongoing high level Command and Control project (number 26), the

Secretary General and Chief of Staff emphasised the major significance of this project given

its potential implications for other projects and also wider policy developments, including

those arising from implementation of the Report of the Commission on the Future of Policing

in Ireland.

This element of the Update also identified the Capability Development Plan project (number

31) as being a key initiative and, while it was noted that work is underway on this project, and

that more time is required for it to be completed, the sponsors determined that it needs to

be prioritised as the outcome provides the framework for a number of other key projects that

need to be progressed. In this regard, good progress has been made on the development of

an Equipment Plan and a separate Infrastructure Development Plan (number 33). In relation

to the latter, it was noted that progress made has included an assessment of future needs of

all military installations against forecasted operational activities.

Separately, the Equipment Plan, while not a project in its own right, provides the over-arching

framework for, inter alia, many of the capability commitments contained in the White Paper,

including those broken down as individual projects from 29A to 29G in the White Paper

implementation programme. In this regard, the review as part of this element of the Update

43


-----

noted the good progress that has been made with a mid-life upgrade programme for the

Army’s fleet of 80 MOWAG Armoured Personnel Carriers (project number 29A) which will

extend the utility of the fleet and provide greater levels of protection, mobility and firepower.

Other recent enhancements that were noted as part of the review included the acquisition of

ten new Armoured Logistic Vehicles (project number 29D) which will provide essential force

protection overseas.

It was noted that significant work has also been advanced in relation to updating the Air Corps'

fleet of aircraft, with the imminent replacement in 2020 (arising from project number 29B) of

the existing Cessna fleet with three larger, more capable, fixed wing utility Pilatus PC 12

aircraft which are being equipped for ISTAR (Intelligence, Surveillance, Target Acquisition and

Reconnaissance). Good progress has also been made for the replacement of the CASA

Maritime Patrol aircraft (number 29C) and, following a tender competition, a preferred bidder

has now been identified and contract negotiations are ongoing.

The review also considered the substantial progress that has been made on the Naval Service

ship replacement programme which has now seen four new Offshore Patrol Vessels delivered

between 2014 and 2018 which is beyond the commitment, to complete a three ship

programme, made in the White Paper. In light of this progress, it was decided as part of this

element of the Update that project number 29F, which relates to the replacement of the two

Coastal Patrol Vessels and provision of counter-mine and counter-IED capabilities, will remain

paused pending other decisions which may dictate how best to proceed. Related to this, the

review also noted that planning is underway for the replacement of the current Naval Service

flagship LÉ Eithne with a new Multi-Role Vessel (project number 29E).

In relation to the various priorities that were identified in the White Paper should additional

funding become available (project number 29G), it was noted that 24 Armoured Utility

Vehicles (4x4s) have subsequently been funded, further enhancing force protection overseas.

However, in relation to the National Development Plan 2018 to 2027, which provides €541m.

in capital funding for Defence over the period to 2022, this does not make provision for any

of the other service led priorities. These would include radar surveillance capability for the

Air Corps, further ships for the Naval Service and additional armoured vehicles and air defence

44


-----

capabilities for the Army. Arising from this element of the Update, finalisation of the

Capability Development Plan and the Equipment Plan have been identified as being necessary

requirements to see how any of these specific priorities might proceed, in the event of

additional funding becoming available.

Another important project currently underway relates to the White Paper commitment to

take measures to further enhance the capabilities of the Army Ranger Wing (project number

28) and, as part of this element of the Update, it was noted that a draft report was due to be

submitted by the project team to the project sponsors.

##### 3.6 Review of Chapter 7 Projects: Defence Human Resources

The Defence workforce comprises civil and military personnel with a broad range of skills sets

and experience who must work together collaboratively in order to successfully deliver

defence outputs. The continued successful delivery of defence outputs requires well-trained,

motivated, experienced and capable personnel. The White Paper acknowledges that there is

an ongoing requirement to continually review and update human resource management

strategies for the Defence Forces, civil service staff of the Department and civilian employees

to align them with evolving organisational demands and Government initiatives. This chapter

of the White Paper commits to the maintenance of a Permanent Defence Force (PDF)

establishment of at least 9,500 personnel, considers future requirements and idenfies key

human resources developmental areas for the years ahead.

All projects arising from commitments made in this chapter were reviewed as part of this

element of the Update and further details are contained in Appendix D. Amongst these were

six projects that have been finalised and formally closed. These include four linked projects

(numbered 41, 42, 55 and 57) which were concerned with Defence Forces’ manpower

planning towards delivery of an effective and efficient workforce mix, the need for the

Defence Forces to attract recruits from all backgrounds and to increase female participation,

as well as development of a Diversity and Inclusion Strategy.

Other closed projects reviewed as part of this element of the Update were the development

of a scheme for commissioning officers from enlisted ranks (number 45), and the initation of

45


-----

a programme of targeted recruitment to address priority vacancies amongst Civilian

Employees (number 62). In relation to the latter, the review led to a decision being taken that

there is a continuing requirement to ensure that project outcomes continue to be built into

working practices.

A key conclusion drawn from this element of the Update is the importance of the project that

provides for the conduct of a gap-analysis of skill-sets within the PDF to identify the frequency

of gaps and appropriate measures to address them (number 39). The review identified that

this project is key to commencement of certain other projects, including a number of RDF

related commitments, such as those concerning the First Line Reserve and the proposed

Specialist Reserve. As a result, this project (number 39) has now been prioritised and work on

it is expected to get underway shortly.

In relation to the project that is to review contracts of service for all ranks of enlisted military

personnel in the context of capability requirements and associated appropriate age profiles

(number 40A), the review resulted in it being agreed that this project also needs to be

priorisised, that a tight timeframe is required and that further assistance from the IPA may be

sought, if required.

A key project in this area relates to the commitment to implement the Defence Forces’

competency framework. This will be used for recruitment, development, performance

management, and promotion in the Defence Forces and requires the design, development

and implementation of merit based promotion systems, at all ranks, to enable personnel to

realise their full potential across all ranks and services and for the organisation to succession

plan over the period of the White Paper. As part of this element of the Update, the sponsors

reviewed progress with this project (number 36) (which is merged with the review of the

Defence Forces’ performance management and annual appraisal systems (number 44)) and,

noting that the progress of a pilot scheme had been impeded by an injunction, it was agreed

that the project will now progress in two phases – the first of which is to deal with officers.

46


-----

##### 3.7 Review of Chapter 8 Projects: The Reserve Defence Force (RDF)

The service of members of the Reserve is valued by Government and the White Paper

provides for the future development of the RDF to ensure its continued viability. This chapter

of the White Paper considers the findings of the 2012 VFM review of the RDF and its

recommendations. The roles that Government have assigned to the RDF are also set out, as

are force structure and RDF human resources matters.

All projects arising from commitments made in this chapter were reviewed as part of this

element of the Update. Amongst the decisions taken were that a number of projects related

to the RDF should be merged in order to avoid duplication of effort. Details of the outcome

of the review in relation to all RDF projects are contained in Appendix D.

The White Paper recognises the value in harnessing the skills of former members of the PDF

for a period of Reserve service. As such, the Government decided to retain the First Line

Reserve but that the terms and conditions of membership are to be revised and the case for

the current gratuity is to be examined. While the project to implement this commitment

(number 65) has not yet commenced, the review recognised that the FLR is a potential

resource to address gaps in the Air Corps and Naval Service. It was agreed that this project

needs to be considered, however, in the broader context of the RDF generally and that it

should be merged with project number 66 which relates to a commitment to develop the

necessary regulatory changes and service criteria of the FLR. Also, it was noted that this

merger will offset work involved in the project arising from the commitment to review the

Defence Acts (number 67) in the context of potential crisis situations where activation of the

Reserve is appropriate. The need for awareness of priorities and sequencing of these projects

was noted.

In the White Paper, it is recognised that individual members of the RDF may, by virtue of their

professional civilian qualifications or in the case of members of the FLR, professional military

skills, have professional skills that, on occasion, may not be readily available in the PDF. In this

context, the Government decided that a panel of such professionally qualified members of

the Reserve, to be known as the Specialist Reserve, should be established and that

engagement of these personnel will be one of the options considered in addressing any skills

47


-----

gaps that emerge in the PDF. The relevant project (number 70) to implement this

commitment is currently paused and, following the review as part of this element of the

Update, it was decided that this should remain the case pending the outcome of the PDF gap

analysis project (number 39) which is expected to commence shortly. Similarly, in relation to

the projects, not yet initiated, dealing with the proposed increase of 100 in the establishment

of the Naval Service Reserve (number 68) and for proposals to be brought forward for a

scheme that would allow a small number of suitably qualified RDF personnel to undertake

operational duties at home and overseas (number 74), it was agreed that work should not

commence until the PDF gap analysis project has concluded.

##### 3.8 Review of Chapter 9 Projects: Civil Defence

Civil Defence volunteers provide essential supports in time of need and, in the White Paper,

the Government committed to the continued development of Civil Defence around its central

strategic objective of supporting the Principal Response Agencies in a variety of emergency

and non-emergency situations.

All three projects arising from commitments made in this chapter were reviewed as part of

this element of the Update and further details are outlined in Appendix D. A key commitment

made was to enhance liaison under the Framework for Major Emergency Management and

guide the continued development of Civil Defence in response to evolving requirements. In

this regard, a project (number 79) was initiated to provide for the establishment of a new

Inter-agency Guidance Team (IGT), under the leadership of the Department of Defence (Civil

Defence Branch) and otherwise comprising representation from the National Directorate for

Fire and Emergency Management, An Garda Síochána, the Defence Forces, the HSE and local

authorities through the participation of the County and City Management Association and the

Civil Defence Officers’ Association. The review noted that this project has been successfully

implemented and is now closed. Through the new IGT, the Department of Defence is able to

ensure that Civil Defence core services remain relevant to changing needs at national,

regional and local level and that Civil Defence remains an effective volunteer based

emergency support organisation.

48


-----

In relation to the two remaining Civil Defence projects, both of which have yet to be initiated,

the review noted that arising from work that is underway at Ministerial level, the project

providing for new governing legislation for Civil Defence (number 78) could be considered for

early commencement, while the project relating to Civil Defence SLAs (number 80) should not

commence until after number 78 has concluded.

##### 3.9 Review of Chapter 10 Projects: White Paper Implementation

This chapter sets out the approach to implementation of the White Paper. It provides that the

overall planning period for implementation is foreseen as ten years. This builds on the

successful approach adopted in respect of the first White Paper on Defence. It takes account

of the need to provide sufficient stability for policy and planning purposes given the particular

nature of defence. Accordingly, the arrangements for implementation involve some

significant innovations and these are reflected in the various projects which were reviewed

as part of this element of the Update, with further details outlined in Appendix D.

Notwithstanding the overall goal of maximising policy certainty and endurance over as long a

planning horizon as possible, the White Paper recognised that appropriate review

mechanisms are required to provide for policy revision or recalibration. As such, it provided

for establishment of a fixed cycle of three year defence reviews. The Government’s intention

is that these will assure foresight, flexibility, poise and overall preparedness in terms of

defence planning and provision. This White Paper Update, which commenced in 2018, is the

first iteration in this cycle, and will be followed by a more comprehensive Strategic Defence

Review. Concurrent with this Update, a specific White Paper project (number 86) is underway

in order to establish a framework for the conduct of these fixed cycle reviews. In preparation

for the Strategic Defence Review, it was ageed as part of the review of this project, that work

on it needs to conclude once this Update has been finalised, having regard to, _inter alia,_

lessons learned from the conduct of this Update.

The White Paper also provides that a specific defence funding study will be established to

capture, in a new way, the expected long-term costs of meeting Ireland’s defence

requirements. While this project (number 88) was initially to be completed by the end of

2015, the review noted that this commitment in the White Paper was overtaken by the

49


-----

further publication, later in 2015, of the Government’s Capital Investment Plan 2016 to 2021

and further iterations since then, including the National Development Plan 2018 to 2027

which provides €541m. in capital funding for Defence over the period to 2022. Nevertheless,

the review noted that this project has now commenced with a view to its completion before

the Strategic Defence Review gets underway.

Another project arising from a commitment made in the White Paper relates to successful

delivery of the defence component of the Financial Management Shared Services (FMSS)

project, which is being led by the National Shared Services Office in the Department of Public

Expenditure and Reform. While the review noted that the timelines for the roll-out of FMSS

have changed, progress with the project dealing with the defence component (number 84)

has been maintained throughout and will continue.

### 4. Consultation with the Joint Committee on Foreign Affairs and
 Trade, and Defence - Tuesday, 5th March 2019

Before commencement of work on this White Paper Update, the Minister with responsibility

for Defence decided that the process should include consultation with the Joint Committee

on Foreign Affairs and Trade, and Defence. Accordingly, the Minister wrote to the Chairman

of the Joint Committee on 28[th] August 2018 seeking to open a dialogue with members in

relation to both the White Paper Update and the White Paper implementation project to

establish, as a permanent feature of the future approach to defence policy, a process of fixed

cycle defence reviews.

The Minister met with the Joint Committee on 5[th] March 2019 in this regard. In advance of

the meeting, members of the Committee were provided with comprehensive briefing

material on the ongoing White Paper Update and the implementation project seeking to

establish a fixed cycle of defence reviews. [A full transcript of the Minister’s meeting with the

Joint Committee is contained at Appendix A.]

The following is an analysis of issues raised by members during the Minister’s meeting with

the Joint Committee.

##### 4.1 List of White Paper Projects

Following publication of the White Paper, a total of 95 separate projects were identified to

be completed over a ten-year period. As the delineation of projects was made as a White

Paper implementation measure, a list of such projects was not available to be appended to

the published White Paper. In addition, many of the actions referred to therein were already

fully embedded in the day-to-day business of the Defence Organisation.

However, a suggestion made at the Minister’s meeting with the Joint Committee was that it

would be useful to have an appendix or accessible list of all White Paper projects that could

assist the public in terms of understanding the range of such projects and in order to gauge

progress with implementation.

51


-----

The implementation projects identified following publication of the White Paper cover

aspects that were fresh initiatives and capability decisions arising out of the White Paper and,

therefore, it is important to contextualise such a list of projects. The White Paper covers all

aspects of defence policy and there is a large cross section of on-going work that would not

be captured by a list of White Paper projects. As such, there is a danger that a published list

of projects may be interpreted as covering all aspects of the White Paper and Defence

Organisation outputs and outcomes and may lead to an undue focus on these projects, which

have an overall ten year implementation span, and would not be reflective of the wider range

of work that must be carried out alongside White Paper implementation.

Nevertheless, there is certainly merit in the suggestion and in fact it is already the case that a

list of all White Paper projects has been publicised in a response to a Parliamentary Question

in 2017. In these circumstances, it has been decided to publish, in full, the current list of all

95 White Paper projects at Appendix C of this Report. This will help ensure that the

commentary on the review of implementation of the White Paper, contained in Chapter 3

(and Appendix D), should be clearer for readers to interpret. While the published list can

certainly be a useful reference tool, it must be emphasised, however, that this does not

encompass the broader workload and range of priorities within the Defence Organisation and

encompassed in the White Paper. The totality of work is reflected more broadly in the

Department of Defence and Defence Forces Strategy Statement 2017-2020 and in each

Annual Report of the Organisation.

##### 4.2 Consultation

In his Opening Statement to the Joint Committee, the Minister referred to the fact that the

comprehensive consultation process, which contributed to the development of the White

Paper, had commenced with a Green Paper on Defence which was published in 2013 and

which formed the basis of a public consultation and led to receipt of a total of 122 written

submissions.

It was noted that many of these submissions came from civil society and there was support

expressed at the Committee meeting for further engagement with civil society. The

importance of utilising the breadth of corporate knowledge available was also mentioned.

52


-----

Consultation with civil society is regarded as being an important part of engendering a wider

debate, than normally takes place, about defence issues across society and with stakeholders.

The Department of Defence will look at ways to enhance and shape such consultation as part

of the process of conducting future defence reviews. In light of their national importance,

the Government’s view is that defence matters should ideally attract all party support and

there is an acknowledgement in the White Paper of the strong tradition within the chambers

of the Oireachtas of support for national interest defence issues. In this spirit, the White

Paper committed to a process of all-party consultation to seek to put proposals for defence

reviews in place on a consensual basis, and subject to appropriate refinement through these

consultations, consideration is to be given in due course to putting the review process on a

statutory footing. The Minister’s meeting with the Joint Committee embraced the process of

all party consultation outlined in the White Paper and the Government is committed to

ensuring that any process of consultation in the context of future reviews will continue to

include engagement with members of the Oireachtas.

The extent of consultation that is to be carried out at each review cycle will be addressed as

part of the White Paper project (no. 86) that is focussed on the establishment of the new fixed

cycle defence reviews. The observations of the Committee on the importance of consultation

will feed into the work of the project team. The level of consultation that will be undertaken

for future reviews will depend on a number of factors, including decisions concerned with

other aspects of the review cycles, such as the time-periods covered and the focus of future

reviews. From international comparison carried out to date as part of the project, it is

apparent that many countries engage in wide-ranging consultation when conducting defence

reviews. In both New Zealand and Canada, this includes consultation with the general public

on a large scale, with town hall style meetings, as well as interaction with defence experts and

analysts. This level of consultation tends to be during the development of cornerstone policy

documents, in the same way that the 2013 Green Paper sought to engage the public during

the development of the 2015 White Paper. At the other end of the spectrum, some countries

do not engage in any form of express public consultation on defence policy development.

53


-----

##### 4.3 Fundamental policy changes and legislation

The White Paper represents Government policy on Defence and it is not intended that this

Update will re-open fundamentals of defence policy that were settled when the Government

approved the White Paper in 2015. These fundamentals include the fact that Ireland will

continue to maintain its policy of military neutrality. The White Paper also sets out key

principles on capability development that have led to associated progress on rolling multi
annual equipment and infrastructure plans. Developments at international level, including

Ireland’s decision to participate in the EU’s Permanent Structured Co-operation Agreement

(PESCO), remain consistent with the approach in the White Paper. As such, changes to

matters of fundamental policy were not considered as part of this Update.

In the context of the White Paper reference to legislative provision for the conduct of fixed

cycle reviews, a concern raised during the Minister’s meeting with the Joint Committee was

whether changes to the concept of Irish neutrality, amending the triple-lock system and

developing a defence industry might be envisaged. In this regard, the White Paper provides

that consideration is to be given to “putting the review process on a statutory footing” but

this commitment simply relates to the question of whether future defence reviews should be

mandated periodically in law, as happens elsewhere. White Paper project number 86 is

focussed on the establishment of the new fixed cycle of defence reviews, and the project

team will consider this issue, but there is no connection between this and issues such as

neutrality, the triple lock and developing our defence industry.

Clearly, however, the development of a regular fixed cycle of reviews presents an opportunity

to foster a wider debate about defence policy in general. Whether, and how, these future

reviews should be used to generate such a debate is an issue that will be considered as part

of the project. Any debate on defence arising from future reviews will, almost inevitably,

feature expressions of contrary views on Ireland’s current policy of military neutrality,

notwithstanding any desire by Government to seek to confine the debate to certain aspects

of defence policy only.

Regarding concern about seeking to develop an Irish defence industry, the position is that

there are no plans to change Ireland’s approach in this regard. Nevertheless, the White Paper

54


-----

points out that the Defence Forces have participated in a wide range of activities with Irish
based institutions in relation to the development of research, innovation, technology and

education/training initiatives which have the capacity to contribute to Defence Forces’

capability and capacity development. Importantly, the primary purpose of these activities will

continue to be consistent with the White Paper and, as such, will seek to support Defence

Forces’ capability development for crisis management while leveraging the opportunities

which may arise to support innovation, growth and jobs in Irish based industry and thus

contribute to economic development.

##### 4.4 Reserve Defence Force

In relation to the RDF, the Joint Committee has had frequent engagement with the Minister

in recent years and the Minister has undertaken to continue to further develop this

engagement. The Government recognises the important role that the RDF plays in

contributing to Ireland's defence capability. The White Paper is clear that there is a continued

requirement to retain and develop the RDF and it is currently on a developmental path arising

from commitments made, both in the White Paper and also in the Programme for a

Partnership Government.

A point made during the Minister’s engagement with the Committee was there is a need to

inject new life into the Reserve. Clearly, a key challenge is to recruit, train and retain sufficient

personnel to meet the Reserve establishment provided for in the White Paper. However, it is

also necessary to strike an appropriate balance in terms of both PDF and RDF recruitment to

deliver the desired effects in terms of maintaining the capacity of the Defence Forces to

undertake all roles assigned by Government and to advance the single-force structure. The

priority in recent years has necessarily been on recruitment to the PDF. While the Defence

Organisation remains committed to the development of the RDF, within the framework set

out in the White Paper, this must be in the context of other priorities and having regard to

the security environment and resource availability.

In July 2018, the Chief of Staff assigned responsibility for the role of Director of the RDF to the

Director of Combat Support Branch and ISTAR. In this context, immediate plans are to provide

guidance, across all units and formations with RDF assets, for the development of their

55


-----

capabilities in line with both the single force concept and the role of the RDF, as laid down by

Government in the White Paper.

Engagement will also continue with the Reserve Defence Force Representative Association

(RDFRA) on key issues of importance to them. RDFRA have been identified as a key

stakeholder in the relevant White Paper projects and their views will be sought on

appropriate matters as projects mature and progress.

##### 4.5 Department of Defence staff

The Committee raised issues in relation to defence management and staff skilling issues in

the Department of Defence. In the nature of the discussion with the Committee, it did not

seem to be clear to the members that the Department has civil and military branches. These

are provided for under the Defence Acts, 1954-2011. The Secretary General heads the civil

element while the Chief of Staff heads the military element, known as Defence Forces

Headquarters. Both civil and military elements provide supports to the Minister in the

management of defence. While the Secretary General is the Minister’s principal policy

adviser, the Chief of Staff is his principal military adviser. The discussion with the Committee

ranged over some strategic as well as more detailed defence issues and in this context did not

extend to capturing the role of the SMC which is a joint civil-military committee providing a

forum for high-level discussion of major defence policy issues. The SMC members are the

Secretary General, the Chief of Staff, the three Assistant Secretary Generals, the Director, the

two Deputy Chiefs of Staff and the Assistant Chief of Staff. The General Officer Commanding

the Air Corps and the Flag Officer Commanding the Naval Service attend in respect of matters

affecting their services. Close co-operation on all matters between civil and military elements

are a priority. The SMC meets on a monthly basis. Separately, and in accordance with the

White Paper, the Minister may convene as necessary, and no less than quarterly, meetings of

the civil-military leadership of the Department.

The Committee had questions in relation to skilling and expertise. It is relevant, in this regard

to note that below SMC, across the Department, there are numerous joint civil-military

working groups, and less formal joint working arrangements where civil and military

personnel, at all levels, collaborate closely while respecting the separate lines of authority

56


-----

within the Department’s civil and military branch structures. The White Paper contains a

commitment to consider new types of civil-military working and to build on the success of the

Office of Emergency Planning, within which, for more than a decade, civil and military

personnel have worked together successfully in a single branch.

There is a strong commitment to continuing professional development both on the civil side

of the Department and all across the Defence Forces including Defence Forces Headquarters.

In relation to the former, the Department’s recently published people strategy “Ag Obair Le

Chéile” has a strong emphasis on continuing personal and professional development, be it

through the Civil Service wide One-Learning programme or at departmental level through a

mix of formal and informal learning which is tailored to the needs of the individual and the

job. Similarly, the concept of "life-long learning" is also highly valued and promoted amongst

enlisted and officer personnel serving in military branches of the Department, principally

through the Leadership, Management and Defence Studies programme (see section 5.12 for

more details).

Recruitment for the Civil Service is predominantly carried out on behalf of departments by

the Public Appointments Service, and civil service staff are assigned to the Department of

Defence in order of merit as vacancies occur. Civil Service staff in the Department have a

wide range of relevant qualifications, up to and including PhD. level, across a variety of

disciplines including law, policy analysis, political science, finance, and conflict studies.

Department staff are supported with costs of fees through the Refund of Fees Scheme for

undertaking courses of study relevant to the work of the Department and this typically

includes courses in international relations, public administration, strategic studies, and policy

analysis.

Staff are also provided, on an ongoing basis, with job-specific training once assigned to posts

in the Department, as well as elements which are of general application, in order to ensure

they have the capabilities to fully discharge their duties. In addition, under the EU’s CSDP,

courses provided by the European Security and Defence College are offered to staff members

on an on-going-basis.

57


-----

The engagement with the Committee reinforces the importance of continued investment in

HR development and the drawing on relevant civil and military expertise in the management

of defence.

##### 4.6 Overview of consultation

Engagement at Ministerial level with the Joint Committee has re-enforced the importance of

a fixed cycle of review process.

Among other things, it has highlighted the importance, in the democratic parliamentary

setting, of a reflective approach which connects policy formulation and implementation in

ways that are relevant to the changing security context. It has re-enforced the importance of

connection with the citizen and the need for defence to serve society’s needs.

It has also re-enforced the necessity to develop our defence approach, as in other countries,

in a manner that reflects the preferences of our own people and fundamental policies such

as that of military neutrality, while ensuring that our Defence Forces can contribute to and

operate effectively in the international setting.

The meeting with the Committee also highlighted that the approach taken to this and future

updates and reviews must take account of the evolving international setting, not least the

recognition that our security is a product of a wide range of policy influences and factors.

These must be captured as effectively as possible.

The question of resourcing, like all other sectors, will necessarily always feature as a matter

to be resolved as part of national budgetary decision-making, but the fixed cycle review

process can provide pointers as to gaps and future pathways to address resourcing issues.

Finally, the consultation with the Committee affirms that, in defence, there is no end-point,

but rather the process of review seeks to ensure that, in developing an approach and ensuring

we have relevant defence policies and capabilities, these are geared to the future and not the

past.

### 5. Developments since publication of the White Paper

This Chapter encompasses issues and events that have occurred, since the publication of the

White Paper on Defence in 2015, which are outside the matters addressed in earlier chapters.

Important human resources issues, which have emerged in this period, are dealt with first.

This is followed by a description of developments in the wider context including those arising

from the Programme for a Partnership Government, national security, EU and overseas

domains.

##### 5.1 Defence Forces Climate Survey 

The Defence Forces Climate Survey, which was published in 2016, was commissioned on foot

of a recommendation contained in the third Independent Monitoring Group (IMG) Report. In

line with a similar survey carried out in 2008, approximately 11% of personnel were sampled.

Follow up work to the initial findings in the Survey was conducted by the University of Limerick

researchers via focus groups. The resulting report entitled Workplace Climate in the Defence

_Forces Phase 2: Results of the Focus Group Research was published in July 2017 and further_

explored the issues raised in the original survey. These include pay and conditions (particularly

pay for the lowest paid members of the Defence Forces), vacancies, recruitment and

retention, promotion systems, performance management, leadership, culture, morale, stress

and work-life balance.

Issues raised in the survey are being addressed in a number of ways, including

implementation of the White Paper, the Government’s recently published High Level Plan to

implement the Report of the Public Service Pay Commission (PSPC) and the Defence Forces’

work programme. Other actions arising from the Climate Survey will be progressed through

the Conciliation and Arbitration process.

##### 5.2 Public Service Stability Agreement 2018-2020

The Public Service Stability Agreement 2018-2020 provides for increases in pay ranging from

6.2% to 7.4% over the lifetime of the Agreement. The focus of these increases is weighted in

favour of those on lower pay. To date, under this Agreement, the increases due from 1

59


-----

January 2018, 1 October 2018, 1 January 2019 and 1 September 2019, have been paid to PDF

personnel. Further increases in pay are scheduled in 2020. By the end of the current

Agreement, the pay scales of all public servants (including members of the Defence Forces)

earning under €70,000 per annum will be restored to pre-Financial Emergency Measures in

the Public Interest (FEMPI) levels. The restoration of the 5% reduction to allowances cut

under FEMPI legislation is also scheduled in the Agreement.

##### 5.3 Recruitment and Retention

The Government is committed to maintaining a PDF establishment of 9,500 serving

personnel. At the end of October 2019, the whole time equivalent strength of the PDF stood

at 8,762 personnel, comprising 7,063 Army personnel, 738 Air Corps personnel and 961 Naval

Service personnel.

In order to return to an establishment strength of 9,500 personnel, a number of new

recruitment initiatives have been taken including the fact that the competition for General

Service Recruits now remains open throughout the year to maximise the Defence Forces

training capacity and give applicants more opportunities to apply.

Retention challenges within the Defence Forces are reflective of the current economic

circumstances and attractive job opportunities in the private and commercial semi-state

sectors. The level of training and experience gained by members of the PDF makes them very

attractive to private sector employers.

The Government tasked the PSPC with conducting a comprehensive examination

of recruitment and retention challenges in the Defence Sector. The PSPC submitted its Third

Report to the Minister for Finance and Public Expenditure and Reform in May 2019. The

PSPC’s Report was accepted by Government on 4[th] July 2019. The recommendations in the

Report include:

  - An increase of 10% in Military Service Allowance (which will boost the earnings of the

majority of Defence Forces personnel by between €602 and €675 per annum);

60


-----

  - Full restoration to pre-Haddington Road levels of certain Defence Forces allowances

cut in the Haddington Road Agreement, including the restoration of Premium rates

for certain weekend duties; and

  - Re-introduction of the retention/loyalty bonus for Air Corps’ pilots.

Implementation of these recommendations is now underway following acceptance of the

PSPC Report by the PDF representative associations (the Permanent Defence Force Other

Ranks Representative Association (PDFORRA) and the Representative Association of

Commissioned Officers (RACO)).

Following publication of the Report, Government released a High Level Plan entitled

“Strengthening our Defence Forces – Phase One”. The aim of the Plan is to implement the

Third Report of the PSPC, including a range of improvements in remuneration, and put the

building blocks in place for further initiatives. A new joint civil-military Programme

Management Office (PMO) has been established to facilitate full implementation of the Plan.

The new plan, based on the PSPC’s recommendations, will result in reprioritisation of some

of the existing White Paper human resources related projects. The new PMO, under the

direction of the Minister, will ensure that existing projects are assimilated into the new work

programme in an effective way. The PMO will also provide staff support to project sponsors

and facilitate close coordination with the non-Defence contributors, namely the Department

of the Taoiseach and the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform.

##### 5.4 Equality and Diversity

A Diversity and Inclusion Strategy for the Defence Forces was developed in 2017.

##### 5.5 Training and Education

The Defence Forces has continued to value and promote education and supports the concept

of "life-long learning" whereby personnel are encouraged to up-skill and re-skill so that they

can adapt to the complex and changing demands and deliver effective military capability. The

scale of education and training supports provided over the period 2016 to 2018 is illustrated

by the fact that some 3,800 courses were held encompassing over 47,000 Defence Forces’

attendees.

61


-----

The Leadership, Management and Defence Studies (LMDS) programme for enlisted personnel

has continued to develop and to be a source of success for the Defence Forces and its

members. At the end of 2018, the number of Defence Forces’ personnel who have joined the

programme since its inception in 2012 has risen to 2,826. The LMDS programme for officer

personnel has similarly continued to develop and to be a source of success for the Defence

Forces. Officers have completed level 7, level 8 and level 9 degree qualifications under the

LMDS programme, with 223 Officers completing Level 9 Masters Degrees since its inception

in 2007.

##### 5.6 Review of the Conciliation and Arbitration Scheme

A scheme of Conciliation and Arbitration (C&A) for members of the PDF provides a formal

mechanism for the Representative Associations to engage with the Official side on matters

which come within the scope of the scheme.

In light of the many changes in the industrial relations landscape since the inception of the

scheme in the early 1990s, the Minister with responsibility for Defence initiated a

fundamental review of the scheme in early 2018. The report of the review was published on

2[nd] October 2018 and is available at http://www.defence.ie/en/news/publications. The

parties to the scheme subsequently commenced a process to implement the report’s

recommendations and the assistance of the Workplace Relations Commission has been

sought in this regard.

##### 5.7 New Ombudsman for Defence Forces 

With effect from 6[th] July 2018, and following an open competition run by the Public

Appointments Service, Mr Justice Alan Mahon was appointed as the new Ombudsman for the

Defence Forces, for a three year period.

##### 5.8 Organisation of Working Time Act 1997 

The Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection, in conjunction with the

Department of Defence and the Department of Justice and Equality, is currently considering

the legislative manner by which the activities of both the Defence Forces and An Garda

Síochána can be encompassed within the Organisation of Working Time Act 1997. The

62


-----

Defence Forces have undertaken significant work in examining the nature of the duties of the

Defence Forces and how the Working Time Directive can be applied to its members.

Implementation of the Working Time Directive is a complex process and work remains

ongoing at the time of this Update.

##### 5.9 Veterans

The Government remains committed to supporting and providing funding to both the

Organisation of National Ex-Service Personnel (ONE) and the Irish United Nations Veterans

Association (IUNVA). In 2018, the annual grant to ONE increased from €44,000 to €100,000

while a grant of €11,000 is paid to IUNVA annually.

The Defence Organisation has also worked closely with ONE to bring to fruition their plans to

establish additional Veteran Support Centres around the country. In 2018, six new Centres

were opened while work is continuing with a view to opening additional Centres.

##### 5.10 Programme for a Partnership Government
The Programme for a Partnership Government (PfG) agreed in 2016 sets out 14 separate

commitments in the Defence area (see Appendix E). Achievements on implementation of the

PfG include:

  - A total of 42 separate White Paper implementation projects have been initiated and,

of these, 15 have been completed and closed, while a number of others are currently

close to completion.

  - In 2016 and 2018, a new Offshore Patrol Vessel was delivered under the Naval Service

ship replacement programme.

  - Three new fixed wing utility aircraft for the Air Corps were ordered in 2017 and the

first two aircraft are due for delivery in 2020.

  - The procurement process is close to finalisation for the purchase of two new Maritime

Patrol Aircraft to replace the Air Corps’ two CASA aircraft.

  - The mid-life upgrade and maintenance programme for the Army’s fleet of 80 MOWAG

Armoured Personnel Carriers commenced in 2016 and is ongoing.

  - Over €30m has been invested in building works in military installations and barracks

across the country since 2016.

63


-----

  - While the strength target for the PDF of 9,500 personnel has not been met, there has

been continuous recruitment (over 2,000 inductions between 2016 and 2018) and the

Government’s recently published High Level Plan to implement the Report of the PSPC

will further address recruitment and retention challenges.

  - The rate of female participation in the Defence Forces has risen to 6.7% in 2018, with

13.5% of cadet inductions in 2018 being female.

  - An inter-agency guidance team to support and develop Civil Defence was established

and has met on five occasions.

  - A 1916 Centenary Commemorative Medal was awarded, as a special

acknowledgement from Government, to all members of the PDF and the RDF who

served during 2016.

  - Under the Defence Enterprise Initiative, the recent approvals of the Defence

Enterprise Governance Arrangements, the Intellectual Property Policy and the

Defence Enterprise Strategy serve to encourage further engagement and to identify

collaborative opportunities that will develop Defence Forces capabilities while

contributing to Irish research, innovation and enterprise development.

  - Companies and research institutes continue to engage with the Defence Forces on a

regular basis and avail of the expertise offered while three projects involving the

Defence Forces have successfully secured funding under the Horizon 2020 Programme

which is the largest EU research and innovation programme on record, with almost

€80 billion of funding available over a seven year period.

  - Six iterations of the Defence Forces Employment Support Scheme have been held

since it was launched in 2016 and an interim review of the Scheme in 2018

recommended that it continue on the basis of one course being held per annum.

##### 5.11 Strategy Statement 2017-2020
In accordance with the provisions of the Public Service Management Act 1997, a new

Department of Defence and Defence Forces Strategy Statement, covering the period 2017–

2020, was approved by the Taoiseach, as Minister for Defence, in 2017. Development of the

Strategy Statement followed consultation with staff throughout the Defence Organisation,

the Oireachtas Committee on Foreign Affairs and Trade, and Defence, as well as with the

Defence Forces’ Representative Associations. The Strategy Statement provides the strategic

64


-----

framework for the Department and the Defence Forces for the period 2017-2020 and is

[available to view on the Department of Defence website http://www.defence.ie.](http://www.defence.ie/)

##### 5.12 Permanent Structured Cooperation (PESCO) 
PESCO is a capability development initiative aimed at supporting the EU’s capacity to respond

to international crises, including in support of the UN. Ireland’s participation in PESCO, since

its establishment in December 2017, affirms Ireland’s position as a fully committed EU

Member State and enhances our capacity to influence the future EU agenda on CSDP.

While not changing Ireland’s existing security and defence arrangements, participation in

PESCO will enhance our military capabilities for participation in UN mandated peace support

operations; enhance interoperability and, working with our EU partners, thereby ensuring

that our troops are equipped with the latest and best equipment and training. There are

currently 47 PESCO projects that are being developed and Ireland is currently a participant in

two - (1) The EU Training Mission Competence Centre and (2) Upgrade of Maritime

Surveillance - and is an observer on a further nine projects.

##### 5.13 European Defence Fund (EDF)
In June 2018, the European Commission proposed a new regulation establishing the EDF

under the 2021-2027 Multiannual Financial Framework (MFF). The EDF is intended as an

instrument to foster competition and innovation in the European Defence Technological and

Industrial Base (EDTIB). It aims to trigger cooperative programmes that would not happen

without EU financial support and, by supporting research and development activities, to

provide the necessary incentives to boost cooperation at each stage of the industrial cycle.

The Preparatory Action on Defence Research (PADR) and the European Defence Industrial

Development Programme (EDIDP) are the Pilot programmes of the EDF. The EDF Regulation

brings together the Research (PADR) and Capability Development (EDIDP) “Windows” of the

Fund into a single EDF Regulation to provide financial support during the 2021-2027 MFF. The

Commission proposal was that the Fund would have a budget of €13 billion, over seven years,

however the latest Presidency proposal in early December 2019 is for a budget of just over

€6 billion. Both the Pilot Programmes and the EDF are designed to improve the

65


-----

competitiveness, efficiency and innovation capacity of the EDTIB throughout the Union

particularly focussed on the innovation capacity of SMEs.

##### 5.14 Status of Forces Agreements 
Ireland’s commitment to provide professional peacekeepers to international peacekeeping

missions under UN mandates was reinforced when Government and Dáil approval was

granted for the EU and NATO PfP Status of Forces Agreements. A Status of Forces Agreement

(SOFA) is designed to regulate the legal and administrative arrangements as applied to

members of foreign forces operating within the State where they are deployed. The EU and

NATO PfP SOFAs are the standard agreements which apply in relation to EU and NATO led

overseas crisis management operations. They provide the Irish Defence Forces, serving on

such operations, with the same immunities and privileges as all other contributors without

the requirement for complex side agreements between Ireland and other contributors, which

had been the case until these SOFAs came into effect on the 1[st] April this year.

##### 5.15 Brexit 
Arising from the UK’s decision to leave the EU, the uncertainties around the form Brexit will

take have persisted, and indeed increased over recent months, bringing with it a stronger

focus on the potential implications of a no-deal Brexit. The Defence Organisation remains fully

engaged with planning for Brexit to address potential challenges arising. A senior official, with

responsibility for Brexit related matters, represents the Department of Defence on the inter
departmental Senior Officials Group and EU and Brexit Groups led by the Department of the

Taoiseach that are engaged with the identification of key strategic, operational and policy

issues arising. Department officials also attend the Brexit Co-ordinators Group and relevant

Sectoral Groups chaired by the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade. The Defence Forces

also continue to engage in prudent planning for a broad range of contingencies. There is

ongoing close liaison between An Garda Síochána and the Defence Forces regarding security

matters and regular coordination and liaison meetings take place.

##### 5.16 National Security Management
The Cabinet Committee on Security is a new cabinet committee covering issues relating to

justice, defence, Garda reform and national security. The existence of a cabinet level

66


-----

committee facilitates necessary Ministerial involvement in the broad dimensions of security

as well as a range of specific matters requiring Ministerial and Government consideration and

decision. Among these is the follow-up to the Report of the Commission on the Future of

Policing.  This Commission was established by the Government in May 2017 in order to carry

out a fundamental examination of all aspects of policing in this State and to bring forward

proposals to the Government for the future of policing. The Commission reported in

September 2018. Implementation of the Commission’s Report is now being overseen by a

High Level Steering Board and an Implementation Group on Policing Reform, with

Department of Defence input.

Arising from the Commission’s recommendations, a new National Security Analysis Centre

(NSAC) has been established under the aegis of the Department of the Taoiseach. A Director

has been appointed to NSAC. One of the key roles of the Director is to support the National

Security Committee chaired by the Secretary General to the Government. Among other

things, NSAC will have responsibility for the development of a National Security Strategy. The

associated work and operation of the new Centre will help refine and shape the national

security architecture and future approaches across government to assessing the security

environment, including in the context of future fixed cycle defence reviews. The Cabinet

Committee’s remit also includes oversight of implementation of the Government’s High Level

Plan to implement the Report of the PSPC on recruitment and retention issues in the PDF.

##### 5.17 Strategic Emergency Management - National Structures and Framework  
As part of the work of the Government Task Force on Emergency Planning, a review of the

existing national-level structures and processes was initiated in 2014 and culminated in the

approval by Government in July 2017 of the “Strategic Emergency Management (SEM):

_National Structures and Framework”. The aim of the SEM Framework and its associated_

annexes is to ensure that all state bodies can react quickly and efficiently to any large-scale

emergency.

##### 5.18 Capability Development – Equipment and Infrastructure
The National Development Plan provides for a total of €541 million for Defence over the

period 2018-2022. This level of capital funding will allow the Defence Organisation to

67


-----

undertake a programme of sustained equipment replacement and infrastructural

development across the Army, Air Corps and Naval Service as identified and prioritised in the

White Paper and builds on the significant investment programme over recent years.

Equipment plans and infrastructure plans have been developed in order to guide the

equipment and infrastructure project priorities across the White Paper based on the available

funding envelope. Major acquisitions and investment since the White Paper include:

  - A €68m maintenance and upgrade programme on the Army’s fleet of 80 Armoured

Personnel Carriers.

  - A new Offshore Patrol Vessel was delivered to the Naval Service in both 2016 and 2018

under the ship replacement programme. In total, four new vessels were delivered

under the programme which amounted to a total investment of €288m (since 2010).

  - Planning is now underway for the acquisition of a Multi-Role Vessel to replace the

Naval Service flagship LÉ Eithne.

  - The first phase of the Mid-Life Extension Programme of the Naval Service’s two P50

class vessels has commenced with the aim of ensuring the reliability of the vessels for

the next 15 years.

  - Three new PC12 aircraft are currently being built for the Air Corps. These are being

equipped for ISTAR tasks with delivery currently scheduled to commence in 2020.

  - A tender competition is also close to finalisation for the replacement of the Air Corps’

two CASA Maritime Patrol Aircraft.

  - Some €37m worth of infrastructure development projects are currently at various

stages of implementation. These projects include the upgrade and modernisation of

facilities used by Defence Forces personnel such as accommodation, dining and locker

facilities across the Army, Air Corps and Naval Service.

##### 5.19 Overseas Operations 

_5.19.1 United Nations Interim Force in Lebanon (UNIFIL)_

The Defence Forces are currently serving as part of UNIFIL based in Sector West of UNIFIL’s

area of operations. Due to other National commitments both Finland and Estonia withdrew

from the Irish-Finnish Battalion in UNIFIL in November 2018 and 106 additional Defence

68


-----

Forces personnel were deployed to the UNIFIL mission to cover the backfilling of the absent

Finnish contingent for a 12 month period from November 2018 to November 2019.

Subsequently, in November 2019 Polish and Hungarian elements have been integrated to

replace the Finnish contingent. The Government remains strongly committed to the

maintenance of peace and security in Lebanon through continued participation in UNIFIL.

_5.19.2 United Nations Disengagement Observer Force (UNDOF)_

The Irish contingent deployed with UNDOF in the Golan Heights is tasked primarily to serve

as the Force Mobile Reserve, providing a Quick Reaction Force, which is on standby to assist

with on-going operations within the UNDOF area of responsibility. Following significant

events in August 2014 in the area of separation that led to the mission relocating temporarily

from Camp Faouar on the Syrian side of the area of separation to Camp Ziouani on the Israeli

side, the process to return to the Syrian side commenced in 2016 with the enhancement

of force protection measures at Camp Faouar. The Irish contingent has now fully re-deployed

to Camp Faouar on the Syrian side.

The continued presence of the UNDOF mission remains an important element in ensuring

stability on the Golan Heights and the Middle East region.

_5.19.3 Naval Service deployment to the Mediterranean_

In October 2017, the Naval Service began participating in the EU Naval Mission, Operation

Sophia. In accordance with the mandate for the mission, the Naval Service role involved

surveillance and intelligence gathering operations, search and rescue operations and disposal

of migrant boats and Force Protection Operations. The deployment of Irish Naval vessels in

the Mediterranean over the period 2015-2018, initially as part of the humanitarian mission,

Operation Pontus and subsequently as part of Operation Sophia, has been an important

element in Ireland's response to the migration crisis in the Mediterranean and resulted in a

combined total of 18,228 people being rescued in the Mediterranean by Irish Naval vessels.

Tragically, 75 bodies were also recovered by the Naval Service during that period.

69


-----

A decision was adopted by the European Council on 29[th] March 2019 to extend the mandate

of Operation Sophia for 6 months with a temporary suspension of its naval assets while

Member States continue working on a solution related to disembarkation.

_5.19.4 European Union Training Mission – EUTM Mali_

A contingent of PDF personnel have been deployed to EUTM Mali since March 2013. Ireland’s

contribution to the mission increased from 18 to 20 personnel in June 2017. Irish personnel

are based in the mission headquarters in Bamako and in Koulikoro Training Centre. The

objective of this mission is to improve the capacity of the Malian Armed Forces to maintain

security in Mali and restore the authority of the Malian Government and the territorial

integrity of the Malian State. Alongside standard infantry training, training is being provided

in international humanitarian law, the protection of civilians and human rights.

Separate to the EU mission and following Government and Dáil approval, a small contingent

of Army Ranger Wing personnel deployed in September 2019 (as part of a larger Special

Operations Force led by Germany) to MINUSMA, which is the UN mission providing support

to the Malian Government.

_5.19.5 Other Overseas Mission Areas_

In addition to the four previously described overseas missions, the Defence Forces personnel

are currently serving in eight other mission areas. These are as follows:

  - United Nations Truce Supervision Organization (UNTSO)

  - United Nations Organization Stabilization Mission in the Democratic Republic of the

Congo (MONUSCO)

  - Kosovo Force (KFOR)

  - United Nations Mission for the Referendum in Western Sahara (MINURSO)

  - European Union in Bosnia and Herzegovina (EU BiH)

  - Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe (OSCE)

  - United Nations Headquarters New York (UNNY)

  - European Union Military Staff (EUMS)

70


-----

On average, the Defence Forces has 660 personnel deployed across the 12 mission areas on

a daily basis.

##### 5.20 Commemorations
Both the Department of Defence and the Defence Forces played very significant roles in the

success of the various 1916 centenary commemorations held in 2016. Related to this, in a

very significant undertaking between September 2015 and March 2016, the Defence Forces

formally delivered a National Flag and a copy of the Proclamation to some 3,200 primary

schools in the State.

### 6. White Paper Update 2019 - Conclusions

##### 6.1 Introduction

The conclusions from the White Paper Update relate, firstly, in respect of the substantive

issues considered in the Update and, secondly, any lessons drawn in relation to the process

of undertaking the Update.

In overall terms, Defence remains of paramount importance to this State and as a vital

element of overall security policy, provides the bedrock of stability and prosperity across

political, social, economic and environmental domains.

##### 6.2 Update – main conclusions

_6.2.1 Security Environment_

The Update has clarified that while the essential aggregate level of threat facing this State has

not altered in a way to justify increasing the overall stated level of threat, the position has

developed and changed in the period since 2015. Threats to security, involving attacks

leading to loss of life have occurred in, and threats to civil life remain as a feature of, our near

neighbourhood. Furthermore, events internationally impact increasingly on our political,

social, economic and environmental well-being, in ever more complex ways and patterns. The

threats in the cyber domain and from espionage have been assessed as increasing since 2015.

The wider political global environment presents as ever more complex and uncertain. The

presence and activities of groups within Ireland with real or aspirational terrorist intent will

continue as a security preoccupation of Government and relevant departments and agencies.

The implications of all matters considered in this Update are described later in this Chapter.

At this point, it is sufficient to state that the Update reconfirms the approaches in the White

Paper, including the roles of the Defence Forces, and continued development of defence

capabilities to meet a range of current and contingent requirements. In addition, it reinforces

Ireland’s active approach to international engagement as an absolute necessity in the present

and likely future security environment. The undertaking of the updated security environment

assessment, as a practical exercise and in terms of what it says, reconfirms the need for a

72


-----

more evolved approach to national security management in Ireland. The steps taken to

establish NSAC are very relevant in this context.

_6.2.2 National Security Management_

The Government have decided to establish NSAC, under the aegis of the Department of the

Taoiseach, and a Director has been appointed.  A priority for the new Director is to get NSAC

up and running as quickly as possible and to establish it as an important evolution of the

management of national security. The White Paper noted the need to keep such

arrangements under review. The Update reconfirms this necessity and the role in which an

elaborated National Security Strategy will play in this context.

The Update, as well as the commitment to the new NSAC, reinforces the contribution of

drawing from a wide range of information sources, and sharing the results of these, to

underpin high quality analysis. The Update also reinforces the discrete but complementary

roles of the various Departments and Agencies with responsibilities in the areas of national

security. Some of these roles are primarily policy in nature while, in other cases, the role is

primarily in the operational sphere. However, the net effect is to demand a mutually

supportive approach driven by a national set of requirements elevated above any single

sectoral perspective. The Update has also confirmed the contribution of international

engagement as contributing to analysis, preparedness and response to threats to security.

International engagement comprehends our stance through participation in international

bodies, our connectedness to these and being tapped into latest thinking, in terms of

formulation of strategies, as well as capability building opportunities.

The Update also reconfirms a feature noted from the White Paper, the need for greater

debate on security matters in the public domain, while retaining appropriate levels of

confidentiality, especially in the operational sphere. As in all aspects of public policy, a more

informed approach, on national security and defence matters, will contribute to better

decision-making on policy direction and resource allocation.

The experience of this Update also underlines the importance of a National Security Strategy.

The Strategy, which is to be developed under the auspices of NSAC, should identify and

73


-----

elaborate on inter-dependencies and serve to inform and enhance debate in the public

domain on security matters. In this context, for defence and wider security, the Update also

reconfirms the necessity of the connectedness between planning, strategy, delivery of

capability (current and contingent) and operations.

_6.2.3 International Setting_

Inter-dependency could be viewed as the strongest theme bearing on Ireland’s position on

security and defence matters in Europe and the World. It has been noted widely that Ireland’s

defence policy approach of military neutrality is not isolationist. It cannot provide a protective

buffer against global events or developments in the security environment which impact on

this country. The White Paper Update has served to underline the importance of Ireland’s

participation in this international sphere because such participation is the primary means by

which we can shape events or policies taken individually or collectively by other States that

may impact here.

The White Paper Update has tracked international security developments, some of which

Ireland has helped shape. Ireland’s interests in political, social, economic and environmental

areas involve a current or potential security dimension in which there can be a defence

component. The White Paper Update validates the active approach taken in the civil-military

defence arena in conjunction with, and often in support of, other Departmental leads.

The shaping of defence policy is guided by its evolving place in this broad security setting. In

this regard, our very active engagement in the UN, the EU, NATO PfP and the OSCE, remain

central components of our security policy. Ireland’s positive engagement in multilateral

defence and security arrangements, reinforced by Ireland’s contributions to international

crisis management operations, help shape policy and security outcomes with the goal of

advancing our values and interests and contributing to international peace and security and

global social and economic development, with a particular emphasis on developing states.

The White Paper Update also reconfirms, in terms of developing defence capabilities, the

importance of engagement in the worldwide defence and military sphere both to contribute

74


-----

to and to benefit from interaction with our partners in the UN, EU, NATO PfP, as well as a

range of bilateral State contacts.

Overseas peace support operations are a very tangible manifestation of Ireland’s foreign and

security policy. These are delivered through a strong policy-led approach, along with the

determination, building and retention of relevant military capabilities. The contribution of

capability development planning and execution is highlighted further on in this Chapter.

However, it is necessary to note the importance of this in the international sphere on its own

account. Furthermore, with the increasing complexity within most of the theatres in which

overseas peace support deployments arise, or are likely to arise, this Update notes an added

imperative for strong capability planning and execution. The complexity referred to

comprehends a range of influencing factors leading, in some circumstances, to the

expectation of higher intensity military operations to create the safe and secure environment

for political engagement essential to the achievement of the peaceful outcomes ultimately

sought.

In recording the evolution of security policy features, especially in the EU through PESCO and

other CSDP initiatives, the Update captures the increasing rigour which governs questions of

the level of military capacity and, at policy level, the associated guiding level of ambition.

Increasing transparency, as well as the practical aspects of security cooperation, generate a

requirement to underpin policy ambition or aspiration with practical defence capabilities

which can be independently observed to serve current security requirements.

The 2015 White Paper’s comprehensive approach captured the range of projects which will

contribute to stronger capabilities across a series of specified areas. The Update validates the

necessity of this work, and in addition, puts the spotlight, into the future, on the optimum

means to ensure that deployable and effective military capabilities are available in the

circumstances likely to be required in this evolving international setting to meet Government

priorities. The Update reinforces Ireland’s engagement with NATO PfP, through the Planning

and Review Process as an essential element in giving greater definition to what needs to be

done. In addition to this as a partner country we have access to, and have utilised, the

evaluation of capabilities as a part of the Operational Capabilities Concept (OCC) process.

75


-----

The Update was undertaken while Brexit has continued to evolve. The precise security

implications of Brexit remain hard to predict, albeit that the overall setting in which security

resides may be adversely impacted. It is not clear, at this point, that any particular

implications call for a defence response beyond what is committed in the White Paper,

through an active policy-led approach along with the on-going enhancement of a range of

capabilities to best deliver the roles of the Defence Forces as determined by Government. In

this context, the Defence Forces’ roles, in the domestic security domain, remain very

important. Prudent planning remains the essential relevant focus against the backdrop of the

UK’s stated position, the Withdrawal Agreement and the responsibility, in the first instance,

of the Department of Justice and Equality, along with An Garda Síochána, for internal security

matters and the Office of the Revenue Commissioners for customs issues.

_6.2.4 Human Resources_

The White Paper contains a chapter devoted to delivering an approach to human resources

in the Defence Forces taking account of the absolute importance of this element of capability.

Similar importance is attached to human resources management in the civil branches of the

Department of Defence and in Civil Defence. Human resources issues in the Defence Forces

have remained an area of very significant attention in recent times. This is not surprising as

the Defence Forces cannot do what Government requires unless it can recruit and retain the

necessary personnel with the appropriate skills. The challenges faced are not unique to

Ireland’s military and can also be observed internationally. Addressing these human resources

imperatives is an absolute requirement and one which has received very significant attention

by the Minister and civil and military management and has engaged the input of a range of

external parties including the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform. It is clear that

all dimensions of human resources management will require unrelenting attention into the

future. A High Level Plan has been developed to implement the Report of the PSPC on

recruitment and retention issues in the PDF and this will be the principal focus with the White

Paper in this regard.

_6.2.5 Defence Investment_

The multi-annual capital programme, launched as Project Ireland 2040, increased the overall

level of investment in Defence. Understandably, during the economic crisis, investment in

76


-----

Defence, as elsewhere, was significantly curtailed. However, the impact of this period of

reduced investment allied to the relatively low absolute levels of investment, tightly constrain

the building of capability as fast as would be desirable. Absolute levels of spend, even with

the increases under _Project Ireland 2040, remain low against comparable international_

benchmarks. In addition, assessed against the natural equipment life-cycles, some in the

areas of secure communications, transport, aircraft and ships have reached or are about to

reach their end of life. While new investment provides some additions to capability, much of

the planned investment falls into the category of retaining capability.

The demands on capability, at home but especially abroad, continue to become more

sophisticated and dynamic. Present funding levels result in major equipment platforms being

replaced only very sequentially, or over extended periods of acquisition. The new Equipment

Development Plan currently being finalised, provides an updated process to identify and

prioritise equipment investment over the medium term. However, given current allocations,

many of the equipment requirements identified cannot be advanced for some time. Others,

identified in the White Paper as being suitable for investment, should additional investment

become available, for the present, fall outside what can be prioritised within existing budgets.

The need to take account of climate change objectives will be a further consideration in

relation to future investment. The inclusion, in the White Paper, of a commitment to proceed

with a new Multi-Role Naval Vessel arises, in part, from the effects, including more difficult

sea conditions, observed in the maritime domain as a result of climate change.

An area in which investment has been particularly constrained is that of physical

infrastructure. As well as training lands and ranges, this chiefly covers military facilities in

barracks, comprising accommodation, support, training and all other aspects of running and

maintaining defence operations across land, air and sea. While there have been very

important modernisation projects completed in the last few years, there is continuing

potential for additional investment in such military facilities. In order to advance projects in

an effective and manageable way, a focussed five year infrastructure programme, utilising

the investment provided for in Project Ireland 2040, will be launched in January 2020. This

will provide the means to channel available funds to where these will have the strongest

impact, while acknowledging the potential for additional investment.

77


-----

In summary, given what was acknowledged already by Government in the 2015 White Paper,

it is not surprising that the present Update should identify continuing potential for additional

capital investment in equipment and infrastructure. The Defence Organisation continues to

pursue all strategies to increase absolute levels of investment and to get best value, and

maximum capability possible, in its approach to procurement.

Developments in relation to EU funding arrangements for defence related activity under the

next Multi Annual Framework will bear on future investment approaches. While these have

not taken detailed shape in the period of this Update, the position is evolving quickly,

including in relation to the potential for Irish enterprise to respond to business opportunities

that would support Defence Forces’ capabilities, while also benefitting from such funding

more broadly.

_6.2.6 Capability and Capability Planning_

One of the strongest conclusions coming through the White Paper projects review as a whole

was the need to build a stronger and more integrated approach to capability planning and

delivery. It is a reality that individual projects will necessarily focus, in the first instance, on

those elements of capability with which they are primarily concerned. However, to succeed

in delivering capability at Defence organisational level, no single area of capability can operate

in isolation. Thus, for example, measures to develop human resources through new training

initiatives may require an additional infrastructural measure. New and better equipment is

only as good as the availability of relevant personnel trained to utilise it and having access to

appropriate infrastructure to operate, store or maintain the equipment. Comprehensive

analysis and determination of cross-cutting capability requirements is the best means of

optimal prioritisation of effort.

There is a specific White Paper project dealing with capability development, including

developing a process to embed this into the strategic management function of the Defence

Organisation. This Update strongly reinforces the necessity for this project and the need for

it to be accelerated. The contribution of all projects to some or a number of elements of

capability, along with their associated inter-dependencies, would suggest that the Capability

78


-----

Development Function should, taking account of the work already in progress, be given

greater prioritisation in the immediate period ahead.

It would not have been possible within the scope of the Update to complete an end-to-end

review of all capabilities in order to confirm existing capabilities or re-order these. The

approach taken in the review of White Paper Projects did allow for some degree of

individualised analysis of progress and combined with the updated assessment of the security

environment, and review of changes generally in the Defence setting since 2015, allowed for

a high-level appraisal of areas of capability which would warrant particular attention. Those

identified as warranting specific attention include the importance of further development of

special forces capabilities, enhancing ISTAR, addressing deficiencies in radar capabilities

across all domains, building cyber capacity for the present and the future, as well as emerging

equipment requirements involved in providing enhanced levels of force protection for

deployment in future overseas missions. Capability planning must retain a balanced approach

across the roles of the Defence Forces, taking account of international and domestic security

domain requirements.

The gap in Defence Forces personnel strength below establishment is an undesired capability

deficiency in itself. Similarly, the lack of contingency due to personnel shortfalls, which a full

establishment would retain, is a capability gap worth noting on its own. This can be especially

marked in the case of specialist areas, which in their nature are smaller in scale and more

vulnerable to gaps in strength and/or experience.

_6.2.7 Defence Forces Organisation_

In the nature of a White Paper Update, it was not intended to conduct an organisational

review. A range of individual White Paper projects either bear directly on organisation or

have organisational implications. Some of these involve how the organisation is structured

and managed and some relate to the resources allocated to particular roles and functions. A

combination of factors have resulted in gaps between the establishment provided for in the

White Paper and actual Defence Forces strength. In large measure, operations have been

maintained. In this regard, without giving rise to any compromise on safety, necessary

mitigation measures have been taken. However, inevitably there is reduced contingency and

79


-----

operations conducted on an “as available” basis operate at a level below what they could be

at full strength. Particular pressures are coming to bear in relation to the scope of Air and

Naval operations and the operational availability of some aircraft and the overall number of

ships.

That said, overseas operations have continued at a high and indeed higher tempo, with

enlarged deployments to Lebanon and a naval deployment to the Mediterranean continued

in the period since 2015. In addition, significant urgent or critical requirements in the security

or aid to the civil power domains have been met to a very high standard.

HR policy is directed in large measure to assure that for the future, the Defence Forces have

the personnel in the roles required at the correct overall strength level. This is not the

position at present and there are difficult shortfalls in certain key areas, including pilots, air

traffic control, engineering, ordnance, communications as well as naval general and specialist

roles. In addition, this Update gives recognition to the possibility of the need for additionality

in certain areas including special forces, cyber, safety management, headquarters (including

capability development and joint operations) and other specialist areas. However, given the

gap between existing establishment and current strength, the immediate focus must remain

in filling these existing gaps to get to the White Paper strength of at least 9,500 personnel.

Taking account of this position, the Minister for Defence will prioritise specialist elements

where a robust case emerges while also working to bring overall numbers to the agreed

establishment strength.

_6.2.8 Review of specific White Paper projects_

The importance of prioritised advancement of the Capability Development Function has been

outlined earlier but the review of White Paper projects also drew specific attention to a

number of other key themes to be considered in the overall project prioritisation exercise

coming from the conclusion of the Update.

In particular, the project to conduct a gap-analysis of skill-sets within the PDF to identify the

frequency of gaps and appropriate measures to address them has been identified as a key to

commencement of certain other projects, including a number that relate to the RDF, the First

80


-----

Line Reserve and the proposed Specialist Reserve. The gap-analysis project is, however, one

that the Minister with responsibility for Defence included in his prioritised list of Tranche 2

projects earmarked for commencement. Project planning, as well as work to agree a

methodology to identify gaps, are now underway.

While the immediacy of the requirement to commence a specific defence funding study, as

identified in the White Paper in 2015, was overtaken by subsequent capital funding

commitments, now covering the period to 2022, there will be benefit in progressing this

project with a view to its completion prior to finalisation of the approaching Strategic Defence

Review.

Also of significance is the fact that the Secretary General and Chief of Staff, who are joint

sponsors of the review of high level command and control, noted that this project is of major

significance.

_6.2.9 Defence Management_

Chapter 10 of the White Paper deals very comprehensively with the management of defence

and a range of initiatives are underway in this important area. As outlined earlier, the progress

in implementing the White Paper, with 42 major projects initiated so far (of which 15 are

completed), underlines the contribution of civil and military personnel working effectively in

joint teams to achieve common goals. Beyond the achievement of the individual outcomes,

the transformational quality of the project management based approach is a significant wider

organisational benefit. The continued internal evolution and maturing of the approach to

project management, along with the Department (civil and military) leadership of Our Public

Service 2020 Action 10 (To embed programme and project management in the Public Service),

will continue to reinforce the contribution of this approach to beneficial public outcomes.

Strategic management of Defence continues to be led by the Minister with responsibility for

Defence and the enhanced arrangements, in terms of senior level meetings, has contributed

to the positive development of defence policy and capability in support of Government

priorities. It has also provided the means to provide the right focus on addressing challenges

even if these challenges, particularly in the human resources area, are not necessarily

81


-----

amenable to easy quick solutions. This Update confirms the need for a continued

concentration of effort by senior civil and military management working together to a joint

and agreed agenda. The development of a prioritised approach to issues (under the

framework of the White Paper, the Strategy Statement covering the Defence Organisation

and relevant business and annual plans) reinforce the approach of a joint vision and an

enabling set of actions.

The Update also confirms the benefit, in public policy terms, of the White Paper on Defence

in comprehending all aspects of defence. Compared to other sectors, which do not have a

single all-embracing policy framework, the White Paper, evolved further by means of the

commitment to a process of fixed-cycle reviews, provides for the management of Defence

through a common holistic and strategic framework with an integrated set of projects,

priorities and timelines.

##### 6.3 Conclusions in relation to the Update Process

The process of undertaking this Update has confirmed the value of taking stock of the position

in relation to Defence in the period since publication of the White Paper on Defence in 2015.

In assessing the Update process, the following conclusions have been reached:

  - The opportunity to conduct a structured update of the security environment, drawing

on the input of all relevant Departments and Agencies, is a critical element and an

essential foundation for all other aspects of the Update.

  - There is significant value to all of the Departments and Agencies in their engagement

on the updated assessment of the security environment for their own purposes and

to reconfirm the indivisible nature of security and its broad context embracing a range

of policy and operational areas, well beyond the singularity of defence provision alone.

  - The Update has provided an opportunity to maintain a forward looking stance at the

strategic level with the prospect of advancing further innovation.

  - While the White Paper implementation process has involved a concerted project

management led approach, the Update has provided the means and opportunity to

step above this to review overall progress and to assess more strategically the linkages

82


-----

between different projects. It has also given Project Sponsors and Leads the licence

to consider whether the original scope and relevance of projects remain valid.

- In addition, the adoption of a project management led approach has proved valuable

in facilitating and promoting civil-military leadership of projects. It is recognised that

it will be beneficial to incorporate the senior sponsorship component into project

management structures on other defence initiatives into the future.

- Viewed from the perspective of the totality of projects contained in the White Paper,

the Update process has been very useful in terms of management of relevant

workflows, not least in future prioritisation of projects and sequencing, while it has

also recognised work already underway across the Defence Organisation that is

addressing commitments made in the White Paper (outside of the formalised project

management process).

- The review of White Paper Projects, as part of the Update, also highlighted the

relevance of correct identification of project stakeholders and gave emphasis to the

different contributions of such stakeholders. This can be developed further having

regard to their distinct roles and determination of the optimal timing and modalities

of their input.

- The Update has taken longer than was originally envisaged. This is a combination of

it being the first time it has been done as well as other work pressures. Momentum,

however, was maintained throughout, even if individual phases of work took longer

than planned. It is concluded that a dedicated staff will be required to undertake the

future Strategic Defence Review.

- There is scope to develop a more evolved approach to the consultative process with

the Oireachtas to enhance the process of parliamentary engagement and provide

sufficient opportunities for parliamentary input to the process.

- The Update has underlined the absolute necessity for the process of fixed cycle

reviews established under the White Paper and, furthermore, gives emphasis to the

necessity for the intended comprehensive nature of the next review which will be a

Strategic Defence Review.

##### 6.4 The Future

The process of completing this Update, along with the issues that have been identified for

attention, provide comprehensive validation of the decision in the 2015 White Paper to

introduce a process of fixed cycle reviews. The implementation of a permanent approach to

this will now be advanced quickly.

The existing White Paper project to design the long-term approach to fixed cycle reviews will

now be accelerated so that the Strategic Defence Review can take shape and commence on

a timely basis.

**Joint Committee on Foreign Affairs and Trade, and Defence debate -**

**White Paper on Defence Update: Discussion**

**Brendan Smith, Chairman**
In the second part of today's meeting, we will meet the Minister of State, Deputy Paul Kehoe, to
discuss the White Paper update on fixed-term reviews. The Minister of State is very welcome. I also
welcome his officials and thank them for the briefing in advance of the meeting. Before we begin,
members, witnesses and persons in the Public Gallery are requested to ensure that for the duration
of the meeting mobile phones are turned off completely or switched to airplane, safe or flight mode,
depending on their device. It is not sufficient to put phones on silent mode, as this will maintain
interference with the broadcasting system.

I draw the attention of witnesses to the fact that by virtue of section 17(2)(l) of the Defamation Act
2009, they are protected by absolute privilege in respect of their evidence to the committee. However,
if they are directed by the committee to cease giving evidence on a particular matter and they
continue to so do, they are entitled thereafter only to a qualified privilege in respect of their evidence.
They are directed that only evidence connected with the subject matter of these proceedings is to be
given and they are asked to respect the parliamentary practice to the effect that, where possible, they
should not criticise or make charges against any person, persons or entity by name or in such a way
as to make him, her or it identifiable.

Members are reminded of the long-standing parliamentary practice to the effect that they should not
comment on, criticise or make charges against a person outside the House or an official either by name
or in such a way as to make him or her identifiable.

**Minister of State at the Department of Defence (Deputy Paul Kehoe)**
I thank the Chairman and members of the joint committee. I very much welcome this opportunity to
engage with the committee on two connected processes currently being undertaken within my
Department with civil and military involvement, namely, the ongoing White Paper update for 2018
and 2019 and the White Paper implementation project, which is focused on the establishment of a
fixed cycle of defence reviews as a permanent feature of defence policy.

I look forward to listening to and noting the comments and observations of committee members
present today. I particularly want to stress that these are new developments in our approach to
defence policy. I am very much in listening mode today and I appreciate that any new ways of doing
things, particularly when it comes to defence, should ideally attract broad support across the Houses.
This has been a long-standing tradition which I am keen to maintain.

As members will be aware, the White Paper on Defence, which was approved by the Government in
July 2015, provides the strategic and comprehensive defence policy framework for the ten-year period
up to 2025. As such, the White Paper is the Government’s medium-term policy on defence. It is the
second White Paper on Defence. Its predecessor, the first White Paper, dated back to 2000. The
comprehensive consultation process that led to the approval of the current White Paper commenced
with publication of a historic Green Paper on Defence in July 2013. This initiated a public consultation
on the White Paper and in doing so it broke new ground by actively encouraging open debate and

86


-----

critical thinking about Ireland’s future defence policy requirements. In response to the Green Paper
my Department received a total of 122 written submissions and follow-on meetings with a wide
variety of stakeholders and interested parties were subsequently held.

In addition to the public consultation process, officials from the Department of Defence liaised
extensively with a broad range of Government Departments and agencies with a common interest in
security or which avail of the services of the Department, the Defence Forces and Civil Defence. There
was also consultation with international organisations with a particular focus on international peace
and security-related peace support and crisis management operations. These included the United
Nations, the European External Action Service, the European Defence Agency and NATO’s Partnership
for Peace.

The consultation process concluded by bringing all stakeholders together for an open policy debate,
with an opportunity for those that made contributions to hear the views of a range of panellists and
to debate and express their opinions. This was held in Farmleigh House in May 2015. All who attended
found the event to be useful and thought provoking. In addition, a final opportunity to engage on and
contribute to the White Paper then under development was afforded to Members of the Dáil and
statements were taken in the House at the end of June 2015. The views of all those who contributed
throughout the process were carefully considered and there is no doubt that the White Paper has
benefited from having had these valuable inputs.

The policy framework set out in the White Paper is designed to be flexible and responsive. This is
important, given the dynamic nature of the current security environment. It is also designed to enable
the defence organisation, comprising the Department of Defence and the Defence Forces, to be
adaptive to these changing circumstances and to use our resources as efficiently as possible.

It is within this context that the White Paper sets out the Government's intention to establish a process
of fixed-cycle defence reviews. These are common internationally and give assurance that policy
remains up to date and relevant to changing future circumstances. The White Paper specifically
provides that these reviews are to have a three-year cycle, with every second review being more
comprehensive in nature and, as such, would be styled a "strategic defence review". As set out in the
White Paper, strategic defence reviews will commence in early 2021.

Before that happens, however, the White Paper also specifies that the first in the new cycle of reviews
will be a White Paper update, which my Department commenced last July. Members will recall that I
wrote to the committee last autumn to seek their views. In the interim, a considerable amount of
work has progressed, but it is still relevant to obtain members' views, particularly on the long-term
approach to the process of fixed-cycle reviews. I have not come to this meeting to advance any
particular approach, speak to any particular element of the White Paper or argue any point in our
discussion. We debate many issues at this committee and in the House and there are plenty of
occasions for me to respond to particular points. This is not such an occasion, however. My approach
today is simply to allow a space in which the White Paper update can take account of what committee
members have to say. In conjunction with this, and most importantly for the long term, it will benefit
all if we can put in place an effective, structured and systematic approach.

The White Paper represents Government policy on defence. It is not intended that the update will
reopen fundamentals of defence policy that were settled when the Government approved the White
Paper in 2015. These fundamentals include the fact that Ireland will continue to maintain its policy of
military neutrality. The White Paper also sets out key principles regarding capability development that
have resulted in the subsequent development of rolling multi-annual equipment and infrastructure
plans. Developments at international level, including Ireland's decision to participate in the EU's

87


-----

permanent structured co-operation, PESCO, agreement remain consistent with the approach in the
White Paper. The White Paper also places a strong emphasis on the development of the human
resources of the defence organisation and significant work in this area is under way.

In undertaking the update, we have focused primarily on an updated security assessment and an
analysis of the range of projects being undertaken by way of implementation of the White Paper. The
updated security assessment will be published as part of the update, reflecting a reconsideration of
chapter 2 of the White Paper. As such, it is the product of an interdepartmental and inter-agency
group comprising representatives of relevant Departments and agencies, including An Garda Síochána
and the Defence Forces. Such an assessment of the security environment will remain a key component
of fixed-cycle reviews, as it will be used to situate appropriately the defence policy response in terms
of the lead or supporting roles that defence plays.

In essence, it provides a fully considered and agreed common perspective for all elements involved in
protecting the security of the State. As members will appreciate, it would be inappropriate for me to
discuss the content of the assessment pending completion of all work being carried out as part of the
overall update and, ultimately, its approval by the Government. As with the White Paper, the outcome
will be published.

The second key strand of the update, which is well advanced at this stage, is a review of progress in
the White Paper's implementation. Following publication of the White Paper, a total of 88 projects
were identified to be completed over a ten-year period. From a programme management perspective,
these have become 95 discrete projects, with the implementation of each being supported and
monitored by a joint civil-military White Paper implementation facilitation team. As part of this strand,
the review of progress with implementation has been broken into a four-stage process, involving highlevel civil and military engagement. This process has involved a review of all 95 projects, with different
considerations arising and being factored into the review of each, depending on its current status, that
is, whether it has commenced or is now closed. Two of the four stages have now been completed
while work on the final stage - the report capturing the outcomes of the reviews of each project - is
under way.

Following completion of these two key strands of the update, and having regard to whatever views
members may have, the next important phase of the update will be consideration of the implications
of any change in the context of overall policy requirements, associated tasks, capability development
and resourcing. All of this work, including that carried out to date, is being overseen by a high-level
civil-military steering group that meets regularly to review progress and the overall approach. It is my
intention that, when all work is finalised, the White Paper update will be brought to the Government
for approval of the outcome and for a decision on any change in approach that may be required.

The second aspect of my engagement with the committee is to listen to the views of members on the
White Paper implementation project that is focused on the establishment of a fixed cycle of defence
reviews as a permanent feature of defence policy. In this regard, the White Paper sets out the
Government's intention that these defence review processes are to be given a new standing in public
management terms. The White Paper specifically provides for a new set of arrangements to ensure
that a strong strategic defence planning and decision making approach is taken. I have outlined the
process already under way in terms of the first White Paper update and the commitment on the part
of the Government to commence a strategic defence review in early 2021.

One of the White Paper implementation projects under way in the Department of Defence is focused
on developing a formalised structure, to be approved by the Government, for these fixed cycles of
defence reviews. This ongoing project, which is being undertaken by a civil-military team, is principally

88


-----

considering the structure and processes for the future conduct of defence reviews and, in doing so,
will draw from the experience gained in carrying out the current update. The project team has
undertaken a broad-ranging study, including academic review and international comparisons, in order
to identify the key elements that could shape the conduct of future defence reviews. When finalised,
proposals in this regard will be brought to the Government for approval. Before that happens,
however, it is the Government's stated intention in the White Paper to engage in a process of all-party
consultation on the overall approach. This committee is an ideal forum to address that commitment.

There are a number of key elements being considered as part of the ongoing project and, subject to
the committee's perspective, it is on the following questions, in particular, that I would appreciate
views: whether legislative provision should be made for the conduct of fixed-cycle reviews; the extent
to which the reviews should differ – for example, what should distinguish an update from a strategic
defence review; the level and breadth of consultation for each; the frequency and timing of reviews;
and whether, regardless of these reviews, there is a case for a continuing approach that includes
provision for further White Papers and, if so, when, within the new cycle of reviews.

Having outlined the purpose of my seeking this engagement with the joint committee, and once again
emphasising that my approach today is simply to take account of what committee members have to
say, I look forward to listening to and considering their views on these important matters related to
the White Paper on Defence.

**Brendan Smith, Chairman**
I thank the Minister of State for his detailed presentation on the work that is ongoing and for the
update on the White Paper.

**Deputy Maureen O'Sullivan**
I acknowledge the engagement with the committee. It is positive that we are meeting rather often on
these matters.

The Minister of State mentioned a high-level civil-military steering group. Who exactly are the
members of that group?

The Minister of State also referred to whether legislative provision should be made for the conduct of
fixed-cycle reviews. What kinds of changes does he envisage that would require such provision? I am
putting this in the context of a report I have been quoting recently and on which the Minister of State's
MEP colleagues engaged at EU level, namely, Ireland and the EU: Defending our Common European
Home. It contains some alarming comments - for example, on redefining the concept of Irish
neutrality, amending our triple-lock system and developing our defence industry. It does not sit easily
that such comments are coming from some MEPs when we are committed to Ireland's neutrality here.

It was great that the Minister of State received so many submissions. Many came from civil society. I
am wondering about further engagement because, with defence, it is civil society that is most effective
when anything goes wrong.

There is an increase in military expenditure. Does the Minister of State envisage further increases?
There are concerns in this regard. I asked the Minister of State before about the multi-role vessel that
was possibly being purchased.

I thank the Minister of State for the letter he sent me following up on my question on training. He
outlined in it some of the training that takes place. I acknowledge the great work our peacekeeping
forces do when on UN-mandated missions. My question was on interrogation training. The Minister

89


-----

of State reverted to me on some of the other types of training. It is important to emphasise the
importance of training on gender and refugee issues. We saw the so-called training for the Libyan
coast guard was far from what it should have been. Our troops are much better trained. Given Irish
troops' training on human rights and gender and refugee issues, could we more proactive in this
regard? What happened in Libya and the Mediterranean was most unsatisfactory.

The Minister of State mentioned his role in planning for Brexit. I was in Belfield last week for the launch
of our international development policy, A Better World. Was there engagement with the Minister of
State's Department? How does he complement priorities in the new policy document with what we
are seeing in the White Paper? Our role has been human rights based and humanitarian. Was there
any engagement with the Department of Defence?

**Deputy Paul Kehoe**
I am not familiar with A Better World. I am not aware of any engagement. I may revert to the Deputy
on that.

The White Paper update steering group has met at least monthly since the updating commenced last
July. Meetings are chaired by a relevant assistant secretary and are attended by the assistant chief of
staff and the heads of the Department's planning and organisation branch and the Defence Forces
strategic planning branch. There is also a White Paper working group, which will consider any
implications for overall defence policy requirements, associated tasks, capability development and
resourcing. This group comprises the heads of the planning and organisation branch and Defence
Forces strategic planning branch and the White Paper project team.

The fundamentals of the White Paper are not going to change but I am looking for members' views on
it today. What changes would they like to see? What would they like to be added or subtracted? I am
looking for the committee's views rather giving mine. Everyone should know my views on the White
Paper because it was approved by the Government in 2015. We are now on the review stage. I sent
briefing notes to all committee members. I wish to hear members' thoughts on the White Paper.

Deputy Maureen O'Sullivan referred to the Fine Gael MEP group publishing its own paper on the future
of Ireland's policy of neutrality. It is totally separate from Government policy. I always encourage
political parties and individuals, be they Independents or otherwise, to engage in an open and honest
debate on issues that affect everybody daily. These are issues that affect us. We would be doing no
justice to society if we did not have open and honest discussions on them. The discussion paper
reflects the MEP group's own thoughts and it was not endorsed by my political party. A group of MEPs
came together and published the paper. It is not reflective of Government policy by any manner or
means. I welcome everybody's comments, however.

We are increasing military expenditure year on year. The multi-role vessel about which the Deputy
spoke is referred to in the White Paper. This is at the planning stage. It will be some time before we
make a decision on it.

The Deputy talked about the Libyan coast guard. Through Operation Sophia, we are training it. I am
not sure about the extent of training on gender issues, etc., but I can revert to the Deputy on that.

Regarding Brexit, defence organisations are currently engaged in prudent planning in response to
Brexit. This includes active participation in the whole-of-Government framework developing a
response to Brexit. Primary responsibility for the internal security of the State rests with the Minister
for Justice and Equality, Deputy Flanagan, An Garda Síochána and the Customs and Excise. Prevention
of trafficking is in the first instance a matter for the Revenue Commissioners and the Garda. There is

90


-----

a Government Brexit team. An assistant secretary from my Department is on that team. We meet
quite regularly. Responsibility for the security of the State rests solely with the Department of Justice
and Equality. If it acquires aid to the civil power, it calls for the assistance of members of the Defence
Forces or the Department of Defence.

**Deputy Maureen O'Sullivan**
The four MEPs were not just testing the water to see what sort of reaction there would be because it
was completely undermining our neutrality. I am alarmed by the fact that they made their comments
in an open debate in the European Parliament. It is the Minister of State's party that is in government
here. Therefore, there is no doubt about what occurred. Ireland has a very proud tradition of being
involved in UN-mandated peacekeeping missions. That is what we should continue doing rather than
getting diverted into other areas. Regardless of the assurances the Minister of State is giving, there is
concern that we are moving away from our neutrality. I am very definitely of the view that we must
be assured that our neutrality is sacred, as is fitting for an independent, sovereign state, and that we
should not be brought further into the growing security agenda of the European Union. We should
return to saving lives in the Mediterranean as opposed to being part of an agenda bringing people
from the Mediterranean into the Libyan detention camps.

**Deputy Jack Chambers**
I thank the Minister of State for attending. The White Paper update indicates that 42 projects have
been initiated, which is less than half the total number of 95. To date, only 11 of those 95 projects
have been completed. It is clear, therefore, that there has been an under-delivery in terms of the
White Paper. As I just stated to Senator Ned O'Sullivan, there is very little detailed information in the
Minister of State's statement. It was just an exercise in grammar and language. He explained very little
in terms of what he is actually doing with regard to many key issues. I have a number of questions
about some of the key issues that are fundamental to the White Paper.

The Chief of Staff was before the Public Service Pay Commission recently. I was very surprised to hear
that the Chief of Staff was joined by two officials from the Department of Defence and two from the
Department of Public Expenditure and Reform. I would see that as a muzzling of military management
regarding its plea to the Public Service Pay Commission. Why did the Minister of State and his
Department seek to attend that meeting with the Chief of Staff? Why did they not allow him to
exercise his discretion with the commission?

My second question relates to my shock at seeing the effective strength as of March 2019. We have
45% strength in the First Brigade, 45% strength in the Second Brigade, 34% strength at the Defence
Forces training centre, 22% strength in the Air Corps and 23% strength in the Naval Service. This is a
complete destruction of effective strength in our Defence Forces. Why did the Minister of State not
address that in his White Paper update? Why did he not address the serious issues of retention and
recruitment? There was not a word or syllable from the Minister of State about the significant exodus
we are seeing and the failure to deal with it. We are seeing a significant spillover on an ongoing basis.

Could the Minister of State provide an update on the current recruitment campaign for the Naval
Service and the Reserve? There are concerns that it has been either suspended or delayed because of
a difficulty between the Department and others involved in the process. Can the Minister of State
clarify whether the campaign is continuing as normal? What is the position regarding the recruitment
campaign, which was well publicised by the Minister of State and others in recent months?

I also want to get the Minister's view on cyber capability and cybersecurity. Can he outline how many
staff are in the cybersecurity unit? What have the Defence Forces provided for around cyber-capability
in terms of personnel, resources and responsibilities? I understand that there are four positions. Is the

91


-----

Minister of State satisfied that this is sufficient to protect us against the threats we face? Today,
President Macron outlined the serious destabilising effect on democracies across Europe if we do not
address significant cyber issues. How prepared is the Department for that? Can the Minister of State
brief the committee on the capability development plan to achieve this capability?

Can the Minister update the committee on the ongoing EU Partnership for Peace in-depth evaluation
of Ireland's military capability? In the interests of transparency, will he commit to publishing its
contents when it has been concluded? Can he update the committee regarding where the Department
is in the context of the implementation of the two PESCO projects to which it has signed up?

My next question concerns something that might not, but should be, mentioned in the White Paper.
We saw the Departmental change that occurred in the Department of Finance during the recession
and across a number of Departments. What is the Department of Defence doing to ensure it possesses
staff with appropriate academic qualifications - such as degrees, masters degrees or PhDs - in
international relations and security and defence? This is something that has been mirrored across
other Departments. Could the Minister of State clarify how many members of staff are qualified in
those areas? What are the Minister of State's plans to bring forward any legislation to allow the
Reserve to provide time in terms of training, as is the norm in other countries?

Brexit was mentioned by a previous speaker. What bilateral discussions have taken place with the UK
regarding a hard Brexit?

Has there been any contingency planning? Obviously, Ireland has an informal agreement on air
defence cover and the Minister of State needs to clarify the position in respect of it. He needs to clarify
what discussions his Department has had regarding those matters.

**Deputy Paul Kehoe**
Every detail sought by the Deputy can be found in the document. I am not sure if he has read the
document cover to cover but it contains all of the information he is seeking.

**Deputy Jack Chambers**
Could the Minister of State provide an update?

**Deputy Paul Kehoe**
I came here looking for the views of the committee on the White Paper. The issue of pay has nothing
to do with the White Paper. I am just seeking members' views. It would be totally remiss of me if I did
not come before the committee in the context of reviewing the White Paper. I wrote to the committee
in the autumn and stated that I would like the opportunity to come before it to ask members their
views on the White Paper. I will appear before the select committee later today in connection with
the Estimates and have no problem answering any of the questions the Deputy has just posed at that
point. However, most of his questions do not relate to the White Paper. I say this genuinely. The White
Paper is a ten-year project that we will review. If I was an Opposition spokesperson and the Minister
of State did not come before the committee asking for members' thoughts and views on the specifics
in the White Paper----
**Deputy Jack Chambers**
I am not criticising the Minister of State in the context of his appearance before the committee.

**Deputy Paul Kehoe**
I will go through the questions asked by the Deputy. Pay is not an issue for the White Paper but the
Secretary General, the Chief of Staff and officials from the Department of Public Expenditure and

92


-----

Reform met the Pay Service Pay Commission this morning. I do not determine who appears before the
commission. As I have pointed out to the Deputy on numerous occasions, the commission is
independent. I do not say "Send this one in" or "Do not send that one in". That is nothing to do with
me. That is a matter for the commission. Nor is it anything to do with the Minister for Public
Expenditure and Reform. That is why we have an independent pay commission to look at the overall
issue of pay. Nobody muzzled anybody. It is up to the commission.

The overall strength of the organisation is 94%. There is no delay in recruitment regarding the Reserve
or enlisted members. A process relating to a competition will get under way shortly. For security
reasons, I will not give the Deputy details regarding how many members of the Defence Forces are
with the cyber unit in the Department of Communications, Climate Action and Environment.

**Deputy Jack Chambers**
As far as I am aware, there are none.

**Deputy Paul Kehoe**
I have been reassured by the Chief of Staff that it is very well resourced and that we do our best to
facilitate any requests put to us. Cyber issues are security matters for the Department of
Communications, Climate Action and Environment----
**Deputy Jack Chambers**
Cyber capability.

**Deputy Paul Kehoe**
The capability development plan is an ongoing project but it is a priority. A significant amount of work
has been carried out in respect of it. The Deputy asked about qualifications in the Defence Forces. I
will come back to him on that.

**Deputy Jack Chambers**
In the Department.

**Deputy Paul Kehoe**
In the context of amendments required for the DFR R5, structure of the Reserve Defence Force, RDF,
and DFR S7, establishment of the Reserve Defence Force Representative Association, RDFRA, the
regulations encompass a broad range of matters from finance to human resources to training matters
to effectiveness criteria. Amendments of DFR S7 are linked to DFR R5. The former cannot be finalised
with the latter being completed. Amendments are very complex and time-consuming and require
extensive consultation. It is anticipated that the initial draft of the revised DFR R5 will be available
within the coming months. The Office of the Attorney General has been snowed under due to Brexit,
which has delayed all legislation. I am not stating that it has delayed this specifically but we depend
totally on the staff of the Office of the Attorney General to assist us in drawing up legislation. This is
very complex legislation. We have one opportunity to get it right and we want to ensure that we do
so. I expect the revised DFR R5 will be available in the coming months.

**Deputy Jack Chambers**
A couple of my questions were not answered. I asked about----
**Deputy Paul Kehoe**
Sorry, the Deputy asked about Brexit and the memorandum of understanding. Any consultation I have
had with my ministerial colleagues in the UK relates to a memorandum of understanding. Brexit has
no impact on that whatsoever. That was signed in 2015 and it is working extremely well. There is

93


-----

significant communication between my Department, the British Ministry of Defence, our Defence
Forces and the British Armed Forces. The memorandum of understanding that was signed between
their Minister, Michael Fallon, and our then Minister, Deputy Simon Coveney, will stand. Brexit has no
impact on that.

**Deputy Jack Chambers**
The last question I asked was about the EU Partnership for Peace in-depth evaluation of Ireland's
military capability, which is ongoing. Will the Minister of State publish it?

**Deputy Paul Kehoe**
I will come back to the Deputy on that.

**Deputy Aengus Ó Snodaigh**
Since the White Paper was published, I have engaged through a number of parliamentary questions. I
find the way the White Paper is laid out strange. There is no harm in it. If one reads through it, one
will just about find what the tasks and targets are. The Minister of State mentioned 95. We were
originally told it was 88. There is no list within the White Paper itself so sometimes it is very difficult
to judge. Most other documents of that scale have the target, purpose and timeframe in which it is
hoped that goals will be achieved at the end. I know the Minister of State has supplied some of that
material to me since. It makes it difficult for people looking in to gauge whether the Minister of State,
Department or military authorities are successful in achieving what has been set out. It is quite obvious
that we are not achieving some goals.

There is a chapter on retention of soldiers. Recruitment is being achieved. We have seen people being
recruited and cadets being sworn in recently. I congratulate them. There is a dilemma that we have
discussed in the committee, of recruitment and retention and the problems that creates for military
authorities while trying to plan for the future. If one has a cohort of older, more experienced soldiers
leaving and newer recruits, it makes it difficult to plan major events, overseas operations, fisheries
protection operations or for whatever skills are then missing. In recent years, air ambulances have not
been able to provide the full cover that is expected of the Defence Forces by the public. It is conditional
on their availability but the public has, or at least had, a view that the Defence Forces are available as
an aid to the civil power. The military authorities can only do that if they have the personnel and
equipment required. We have seen a number of occasions where they have been constrained or
where it has created difficulties relating to a lack of soldiers or equipment.

An issue I have with regard to the role of the Defence Forces is that there should be greater
concentration on preparing the Defence Forces for more operations abroad, such as disaster relief
and infrastructural works. They have shown in Ireland that they can do that. They have been quite
good if a bridge goes down, for example.

The change to a two brigade system meant the loss of one of the engineering units and a lack of
equipment for disaster and humanitarian relief. I have a different view to most recent Governments,
which seem to have embraced the EU battlegroup role for the Irish Defence Forces rather than
peacekeeping and helping in disaster zones around the country.

My criticism of the review is that the White Paper should be made more accessible. The Minister of
State set out the 95 targets or tasks so that when the cyclical reviews come up, it is easier for people
on the outside to comment and say that they want there to be more focus on certain matters. Brexit
has really changed much of what was set out in the White Paper. The Minister of State is here this
week and it is maybe a pity that it is not next month, since we might have some surety about it then.
That will impact on the call on the Defence Forces relating to Border duties. There are stories about

94


-----

gardaí being trained. There is a plan already in place to put some of the new recruits in the Border
region in preparation for a possible hard border. We saw the issue of fisheries last week. That will
become a greater problem or duty for the Defence Forces in the near future if we do not have the
agreement that we intend. The Defence Forces and the Department, when preparing the White Paper,
would not have been aware of Brexit coming down the track. They would not have been focusing as
much on that aspect of security. While I know it has been done, that suggests a need to continually
review the security situation as the Brexit issue develops.

I have raised this issue before so it is more of a comment than a question. The first duty of the military
authorities and the Department is to respect and protect the members of the Defence Forces and to
enhance morale. There are a number of issues and events that have happened in recent years which
are contributing to lowering that morale. I have not heard any problem with regard to protection of
soldiers. I think they are happy with the protection. Respect of soldiers has been brought into question
by the lack of proper wages and proper health and safety standards in the past.

**Brendan Smith, Chairman**
I will take Senator O'Sullivan. We are running into time constraints again and have the select
committee soon.

**Senator Ned O'Sullivan**
I will keep it very tight. I welcome the Minister of State and his officials. It is good that the Minister of
State wanted to engage with us. Having said that, maybe I was ill-prepared for the meeting or my
expectations were different, but I am disappointed and underwhelmed by what the Minister of State
has to say to us. He says he wants to listen to our views but at the same time, for anyone looking in
from outside, White Papers and Green Papers are like dancing on the head of a pin. People want to
know where the beef is and what the Minister of State's vision is for the Defence Forces. We cannot
treat White Papers and Green Papers as an ongoing circle of bureaucracy.

The Defence Forces are highly respected and held in high regard by the public, and rightly so. As
Deputy Maureen O'Sullivan said, their work as peacekeepers in the UN is exemplary and something of
which we are all very proud. We are also proud of the profile the Army has in many State functions. I
particularly welcomed its activities in schools during the 1916 centenary. It is also lovely to see the
Army band in communities. When there are weather and climate crises, the Army plays a role and this
is also appreciated. These are the upsides as far as I can see but there are some serious downsides.
The Minister of State said the White Paper is not the place to speak about Army pay or all of the
resignations and buy-outs from the Army. Perhaps we will have another day for that. Is the Minister
of State concerned about morale in the Defence Forces? The morale of any force, be it the Garda,
Army or Naval Service, is important. It is important for us as committee members to know whether
the Minister of State is happy with the state of morale in our Defence Forces.

Insofar as the White Paper deals with it, will the Minister give us an update on where we are with
Army property? There has been a lot of speculation that some of our big barracks, such as Cathal
Brugha Barracks, will be used for housing. I am not saying it is good or bad; I would just like to know
the future of Army property in rural towns, such as Listowel, where we used to have slua halls and
FCA property. What is the future for this type of property, as the Minister of State sees it?

Does the Minister of State have plans to inject new life into the RDF? Recently in the Seanad I
mentioned to him that I thought the FCA was an exemplary force that gave a lot of young people in
Ireland training in life skills, a sense of patriotism and something useful. The Army has a very low
profile in the country. This is not necessarily a bad thing. I am not looking for militarisation. The Army

95


-----

has a very low profile, particularly outside of Dublin. This is something the Minister of State could look
at by reviving and putting more funding into voluntary reserve forces, such as the FCA used to be.

The Army has done very well so far in the centenary of commemorations. We are halfway through the
commemoration the War of Independence. Shortly, we will move on to commemorating the Civil War.
There were no angels on either side of that terrible sad divide and republicans, no more than anyone
else, committed atrocities. Nonetheless, some major atrocities were committed by the State and the
army of the Free State in the name of the people. Statements were made in the Dáil by the Minister
for Defence at the time that need to be corrected. Has the Minister of State taken an advanced view
on how this will be handled? It is a very sensitive area and nobody is looking for triumph in this regard,
particularly not me. It would be as well for the Minister of State to have a plan to deal with these
issues as they will undoubtedly arise.

**Deputy Paul Kehoe**
I will respond to Deputy Ó Snodaigh first. There are 88 projects in the White Paper but a number of
them have subprojects and rather than trying to hide the figure of 88, I said 95. I hope that explains
it.

Recruitment and retention are challenges for the Defence Forces but it is a challenge for defence
forces throughout Europe and armed forces throughout the world. When I speak to my European
counterparts, they face the same issues I do. We have funding for a full strength of 9,500. The
Government has provided this. Recruitment will be open in the next short while. I do not have the
exact date but it will be shortly. This is with regard to Reserve personnel, enlisted personnel and
cadets.

With regard to the ambulance service out of Athlone, I am not sure there have been constraints. It has
been fully operational and is very successful. No one has stated to me it has been unable to fly. If it
has been unable to operate, it must have been for a specific reason.

When the helicopter is being serviced it tries to provide----
**Deputy Aengus Ó Snodaigh**
Last year, for instance, flights at night were restricted----
**Deputy Paul Kehoe**
It is because of the type of helicopter we have that we do not fly at night time.

**Deputy Aengus Ó Snodaigh**
Sometimes it was because personnel were not available on certain nights.

**Deputy Paul Kehoe**
We have a memorandum of understanding with the HSE that we will provide the service when
available.

**Deputy Aengus Ó Snodaigh**
It was not a criticism----
**Deputy Paul Kehoe**
I know.

96


-----

**Deputy Aengus Ó Snodaigh**
It is provided when it is available but if it is not available, that suggests there is a shortage that needs
to be addressed.

**Deputy Paul Kehoe**
To date, the Defence Forces have been able to honour all asks by the Government, at home or
overseas. The Deputy referred to operations abroad and perhaps assisting abroad where there is a
catastrophe. At present, where we are on peacekeeping duties we reach out into the communities.

The Deputy also referred to the reorganisation and the number of engineers. We reduced from three
brigades to two brigades but there was no reduction in the number of engineers. The key aspects of
the reorganisation included consolidating understrength units into a smaller number of full strength
units and a reduction in the number of headquarters and the associated redeployment of personnel
from administrative and support functions to operational units.

With regard to Brexit, when the White Paper on Defence was published, it was not even born. There
have been a large number of changes since then. I will not pre-empt what will happen next week. The
defence organisations are engaged in prudent planning in response to Brexit. This includes active
participation in the whole-of-Government framework developed in response to Brexit. Primary
responsibility for the internal security of the State rests with the Department of Justice and Equality,
my colleague, the Minister, Deputy Flanagan, An Garda Síochána and the Revenue Commissioners.
There is ongoing close liaison between An Garda Síochána and the Defence Forces regarding security
matters, with regular co-ordination and liaison meetings.

The Deputy raised fisheries protection. There are implications for increased monitoring, patrolling and
inspecting of Irish controlled waters. This will depend on the outcome when the UK departs. It will be
a matter for the Sea-Fisheries Protection Authority in association with the Department of Agriculture,
Food and the Marine. As I stated earlier, a senior official at assistant secretary level in the Department
is leading the input into the deliberations of the framework established throughout the Government.
The management board also maintains oversight of all Brexit-related matters in the Department.

Avoiding a hard border on the island is fundamental to the draft Brexit agreement reached between
the EU and UK Government. There are no plans to introduce a new Army barracks or Defence Forces
base in the greater Border region. However, the Defence Forces keep operational plans under
constant review. I am satisfied the operational readiness and deployability of the Defence Forces is
such that they can respond effectively to whatever is required by the State or the Government. The
White Paper was originally put together in 2015 and the security situation is a fundamental part of the
White Paper review. In my opening statement I referred to reviewing the security situation of the
State. If Senator Ned O'Sullivan reads what I said about the objectives of the White Paper, that is the
meat. That is my vision. It is the Government's vision of where we see the Defence Forces over the
next ten years. That is why, as I stated earlier, it is important that we review the White Paper. The
strategy statement sets that out very clearly.

Morale is very important within any organisation, be it a political party, the Defence Forces, An Garda
Síochána, a Department or the HSE. However, leadership is as important as morale. That is my
leadership and that of military management and civil management. I have an excellent team around
me, military and civil. It is very important that we show leadership. Of course we have our challenges
but every organisation has its challenges.

On the role of the Reserve, I have stated on numerous occasions that it is an important platform for
the organisation as a whole and that it plays a very important role within the organisation. Numbers

97


-----

have been dwindling because younger people have more opportunities now than they did 20 or 30
years ago. The Government has provided the funding for full training days for the reserves. There is
no lack of funding for their training days. They are well funded.

Over the past 25 years, my Department has disposed of a range of properties deemed surplus to
military requirements. Since 1998, under the barracks consolidation programme, the sale has been
completed of 12 of the 14 barracks closed under this programme. They were Fermoy, Castleblayney,
Naas, Ballincollig, Clancy Barracks in Dublin, Monaghan, Longford, Cavan - they were new barracks Letterkenny, Kildare, Clonmel and Lifford. The sale of Castlebar barracks to Mayo County Council will
be completed in the near future.

The newly established Land Development Agency, LDA, has identified Columb barracks in Mullingar,
which closed in 2012, as a viable solution to the provision of residential units, and it will form a
significant contribution to the 3,000 units to be targeted by the agency in this first tranche of the
provision. Project management branch has, on my instruction, continued to liaise with the relevant
officials in the LDA and the transfer of the site to the agency is a priority, subject to terms and
conditions that are yet to be agreed.

Currently, €37 million worth of capital projects are at various stages, from design to tender to
construction. These include the replacement of the major secure storage facility, phases 2 and 3, in
the Defence Forces training centre, €10.2 million; the construction of new gymnasiums in Sarsfield
barracks in Limerick and Stephen's barracks in Kilkenny, €6 million; locker block refurbishment in
Cathal Brugha barracks, Dublin, €3.8 million; upgrade and refurbishment works at the cook house and
dining hall in Custume barracks, Athlone, €4.1 million, which is under construction at the moment; the
upgrade of accommodation blocks in Pearse barracks in the Curragh, €3.1 million; upgrade and
refurbishing works in the apprentice hostel in Casement Aerodrome, Baldonnel, €3.3 million; the
upgrade of the oil wharf and installation of fire protection and detection and a fire-fighting system in
the naval base on Haulbowline, €2.4 million; the upgrade of one and two block accommodation
facilities in Cathal Brugha barracks, €2.4 million; and the upgrade of seven block accommodation
facilities in Connolly barracks at the Defence Forces training centre, €2.1 million.

The White Paper project is also under way to put in place a five-year plan for the programme. The list
of works identified as part of the project will be prioritised for delivery based on military needs and
will be updated annually to form the basis of the selection of capital projects under the programme
into the near future, and new start projects to be commenced in 2020 will be informed by the projects.

**Senator Ned O'Sullivan**
The Minister of State liked that question.

**Deputy Paul Kehoe**
Absolutely. I also want to make it clear that there are no plans for the sale of Cathal Brugha barracks.

The decade of commemorations is the responsibility of the Minister for Culture, Heritage and the
Gaeltacht, Deputy Madigan. Following on from the work done on the 1916 commemorations, which
were really successful, there is an all-party commemorations committee. We must be very careful in
the context of the decade of commemorations. If an all-party committee worked for the 1916
commemorations, there is no reason it should not work for the decade of commemorations.

**Brendan Smith, Chairman**
I thank the Minister of State. There is a vote in the Dáil. I will make just one quick comment to the
Minister of State. Departments and statutory agencies often have a habit of having the usual

98


-----

consultees on the development of Green Papers or White Papers. We do not respect corporate
knowledge enough. I would love to see people who may have left the Department and the Defence
Forces and those who have served overseas get the opportunity to contribute. One thing we are very
bad at is recognising corporate knowledge and its importance. Deputy Ó Snodaigh referred to this
matter as well.

We have a select committee meeting on Estimates immediately----
**Deputy Aengus Ó Snodaigh**
Chairman----
**Brendan Smith, Chairman**
Is it one quick comment?

**Deputy Aengus Ó Snodaigh**
A point I made was not addressed. When one reads the White Paper, the 88 or 95 projects do not
jump out immediately. One must read the whole document, which is fine, but for members of the
general public to try to gauge whether we are being successful and whether we are achieving those
projects, it would be a useful exercise if they were available with the White Paper or as an appendix
or something in the future.

**Brendan Smith, Chairman**
I thank Deputy Ó Snodaigh. May I just----
**Deputy Paul Kehoe**
Chairman----
**Brendan Smith, Chairman**
Very quickly.

**Deputy Paul Kehoe**
The Deputy has a point. We might be able to do that. To address the Chairman's point, my assistant
secretary to my left has worked on the White Paper since 2000 so he has almost 20 years of corporate
knowledge in this area. He is very well versed in----
**Brendan Smith, Chairman**
I am not suggesting otherwise. However, the good knowledge that exists is often written out of the
script in all respects and not just in the Department.

I thank the Minister of State and the members for their engagement this afternoon. The joint
committee stands adjourned until Thursday, 4 April 2019, when we will meet the former Tánaiste, Mr.
Eamon Gilmore, to discuss conflict resolution and the Colombian peace process. I remind members
that the select committee will meet immediately after the vote in the Dáil.

The joint committee adjourned at 2.55 p.m. until 10 a.m. on Thursday, 4 April 2019.

#### D. Report of the review of White Paper implementation[18]

##### Review of Chapter 3 Projects: National Security - Defence Policy Response

Tranche 1/Active Projects

Three projects were reviewed under this category and the sponsors agreed that there was no

requirement for projects numbered 7, 8 and 10 to be discussed further at Stage 2. Specifically

in relation to project 7, the sponsors noted that this project is progressing towards closure.

Paused Projects

One relevant project, number 13, was reviewed under this category and the sponsors agreed

that as a Project Plan had been finalised in August 2018, there was no requirement for this

project to be discussed further at Stage 2. Subsequently, work has been completed and this

project has formally closed.

Tranche 2 Projects

One project, number 3, was reviewed under this category and the sponsors agreed that in

light of developments, including the fact that the United Nations Standby Arrangements

System (UNSAS) had been replaced by the Peacekeeping Capability Readiness System (PCRS),

this project should be deferred for a period of 12 months and, as such, that there was no

requirement for a Stage 2 meeting.

Closed Projects

Three projects fell for review under this category and the sponsors agreed that there was no

requirement for a Stage 2 meeting in respect of projects numbered 5, 11 and 12.

Merged Projects

There were no projects falling for review under this category.

18 This review of White Paper implementation, as presented in this Appendix, took place over a number of
months and, as such, reflects each project’s status at the time. The “Current Status” of each project is reflected
in Appendix C.

109


-----

Projects not yet initiated

Four projects were reviewed under this category and the sponsors agreed that there was no

requirement for projects numbered 2 and 4 to be discussed further at Stage 2 as work is

already progressing in these areas in any event. The sponsors also agreed that there was no

requirement for a Stage 2 meeting for projects numbered 6 and 9 but, in relation to number

6, they agreed that commencement should be considered only in the context of the outcome

of project number 31 (see Review of Chapter 6 Projects), and in light of the EU’s Coordinated

Annual Review on Defence (CARD) and Permanent Structured Co-operation (PESCO).

##### Review of Chapter 4 Projects: Other Policy Requirements

Tranche 1/Active Projects

Two projects were reviewed under this category. The sponsors agreed that there was no

requirement to give further consideration to project number 19 at Stage 2 but they noted

that projects numbered 17 and 18 are awaiting the closure of number 19 before they can re
commence (both have been paused). The sponsors also agreed the basis upon which project

number 19 can proceed to closure _vis. that the Closure Report would address the issue of_

incentivising innovation. Shortly afterwards, this project was formally closed.

Similarly, the sponsors noted that project number 23 was close to being finalised and, as such,

agreed that there was no requirement to give further consideration to this project at Stage 2.

Subsequently, work has been completed and this project has formally closed.

Paused Projects

Three projects, numbered 17, 18 and 24, were reviewed under this category. The sponsors

agreed that there was no requirement to discuss these projects at Stage 2 but they agreed

that the following sequencing should be applied: Project number 19 (currently an Active

project – see above) needs to be completed first and, following this, number 18 can re
commence with a revision of the project plan and, at that stage, consideration should then

be given to a merger with number 17. However, if number 17 (already merged with number

110


-----

21) is not being merged with number 18, then it should remain paused, pending completion

of number 18.

The sponsors also noted that project number 24 is currently paused in light of the need to

consider options arising from legal advice received.

Tranche 2 Projects

Two projects were reviewed under this category and the sponsors agreed that there was no

requirement for projects numbered 15 and 16 to be discussed further at Stage 2. The

sponsors also noted that project work on number 15 had recently commenced while work on

number 16 is due to begin shortly.

Closed Projects

One project, number 22, was reviewed under this category. The sponsors agreed that this

project should be further discussed at Stage 2 with the two project leads. At the subsequent

Stage 2 meeting, the outcome of the recent review of the Employment Support Scheme was

discussed whereby it is now to continue on the basis of one iteration annually. The Scheme

arising from this project has been very successfully implemented, has been systemised and is

ongoing and, as such, it was agreed that there was no requirement for a Stage 3 meeting.

Merged Projects

The sponsors noted that projects numbered 17 and 21 have been merged and agreed the

proposed sequencing outlined above (under paused projects in respect of number 17).

Projects not yet initiated

Two projects were reviewed under this category and the sponsors agreed that there was no

requirement for projects numbered 14 and 20 to be discussed further at Stage 2. In relation

to number 14, although not yet initiated, it was noted that work in this regard continues in

the background while, similarly, in relation to number 20, measures taken by the Office of

Government Procurement mean that companies are now better placed to compete for

defence contracts.

111


-----

##### Review of Chapter 6 Projects: Capability Requirements

Tranche 1/Active Projects

Seven projects were reviewed under this category. The Secretary General and Chief of Staff

have jointly taken the sponsor role in relation to project number 26. While they agreed that

there was no requirement for a Stage 2 meeting, they also emphasised that this project is of

major significance, and that the implications for other projects, and policy developments such

as implementation of the Report of the Commission on the Future of Policing in Ireland, will

all need to be considered in due course.

In relation to the other six projects, the relevant project sponsors agreed that given the

progress made to date that there was no requirement to give further consideration to

projects numbered 28, 29A, 29B, 29D, 31 and 33 at Stage 2. In relation to number 28, the

sponsors noted that a draft report was due to be submitted, while the capital projects

numbered 29A, 29B and 29D were all progressing well and, as such, further consideration was

not required. Subsequently, work has been completed on project number 29D and this

project has formally closed.

In relation to project number 31, the sponsors noted that the project team’s work in this

regard is well underway but clearly more time is required for this to be completed. This was

identified by the sponsors as a key project that needs to be prioritised, notwithstanding the

need for an extension of time. When completed, the outcome of this project will provide the

framework for a number of other key projects.

Meanwhile, the sponsors noted that work on a related project, number 33, was progressing,

and that this had previously been merged with number 32 (which is linked to number 34).

While a meeting of the project leads was identified as a requirement to progress project

number 33, it was agreed by the sponsors that the issues are within the framework of the

project plan, and as such there was no requirement for a Stage 2 meeting. The sponsors

noted progress made to date towards the development of a five-year plan, including an

assessment of future needs of all military installations against forecasted operational

activities.

112


-----

Paused Projects

One project was reviewed under this category. The sponsors agreed that project number 29F

should remain paused, pending other decisions which may dictate how it is to proceed, and,

therefore, there was no requirement to give further consideration to it at Stage 2.

Tranche 2 Projects

Three projects were reviewed under this category and the sponsors agreed that, given the

progress made to date, there was no requirement to give further consideration to projects

numbered 25, 29C and 29E at Stage 2. Specifically in relation to number 25, the sponsors

noted that whilst the project has not yet been initiated, work on a joint Common Operational

Picture has nevertheless been on-going and is close to completion. Good progress was also

noted in relation to capital project number 29C while work is underway on project number

29E.

Closed Projects

There were no projects for review under this category.

Merged Projects

One project was reviewed under this category. As mentioned above under Tranche 1/Active

Projects, project number 32 was previously merged with number 33 and is currently active as

part of that project. As such, the sponsors agreed there was no requirement to discuss this

project any further at Stage 2.

Projects not yet initiated

A total of five projects were reviewed under this category and the sponsors agreed that there

was no requirement to give further consideration to projects numbered 27, 29G, 30, 34 and

35 at Stage 2. However, they agreed that early initiation of number 27 should be considered

and that one of the initial outputs should be to examine the actual requirement. In relation

to number 29G, it was noted that while additional armoured vehicles have been funded, the

National Development Plan 2018 to 2027, which provides €541m. in capital funding for

Defence over the period to 2022, does not make provision for these service led priorities.

Finalisation of the Capability Development Plan and the Equipment Development Plan was

113


-----

identified as being a requirement to see how any of these might proceed, in the event of

additional funding becoming available. Furthermore, it was agreed by the sponsors that

project number 30 cannot be considered for commencement unless and until the radar

capability aspect of number 29G has progressed.

The sponsors noted that, as mentioned above under Tranche 1/Active Projects, project

number 34 is linked to project number 32 which was previously merged with number 33 –

which is expected to close shortly. They also noted that number 35 will require a large scoping

exercise which itself will be a significant undertaking. However, the sponsors agreed that

there is no pressing need to consider commencement of this project as issues that require

legislative change are currently being dealt with on an on-going basis.

##### Review of Chapter 7 Projects: Defence Human Resources

Tranche 1/Active Projects

Five projects fell for review under this category and the sponsors agreed that four of them,

projects numbered 41, 42, 55 and 57 (which it was noted is linked to number 58), are all linked

and each scheduled for early closure. As such, the sponsors agreed that there was no

requirement for these projects to be discussed further at Stage 2. Since then, all four of these

projects have been finalised and formally closed.

It was noted that the above projects are all linked to project number 45 which, at the time

was close to completion and has subsequently closed. As such, it did not need to be

addressed at Stage 2.

Paused Projects

There were no projects for review under this category.

Tranche 2 Projects

Three projects were reviewed under this category and the sponsors agreed that that there is

no requirement for project number 56 to be discussed further at Stage 2 as work was just

about to commence.

114


-----

The sponsors also agreed that project number 39 (which is linked with number 70) needed to

be discussed further, with the project leads, at Stage 2 as they felt that there was a need for

clarity about the nature and scope of this project. At the Stage 2 meeting, it was noted that

a project team has been identified, that Capability (People) Development and Support Branch

is to liaise with military colleagues and that it will be necessary to re-work the Project Initiation

Document (PID) before a Project Plan is finalised. The sponsors noted that there is a need to

agree a methodology to identify gaps, that work is on-going in this regard and, in these

circumstances, they decided that there was no requirement for this project to progress to

Stage 3.

In relation to project number 40A, the sponsors agreed that this project also needed to be

discussed with the project leads, at Stage 2, and they noted that a PID and Project Plan were

required. At the Stage 2 meeting, the sponsors agreed that there was no requirement for

Stage 3. They noted that a revised PID drafted by the Department, with the assistance of the

Institute of Public Administration, had been sent to Human Resources Branch (J1) who will

carry out the coordinating role for all of the Defence Forces in relation to this project. The

sponsors agreed that a tight timeframe is required as this project needs to be progressed as

it is a Ministerial priority. They also agreed that, if necessary, further assistance from the IPA

may be sought.

Closed Projects

One project was reviewed under this category and the sponsors agreed that there was no

requirement for project number 62 to be discussed any further at Stage 2. However, as this

project is focussed on priority vacancies, the sponsors also agreed that there is a continuing

requirement to ensure that the desired outcomes from the project are being met and built

into current working practices.

Merged Projects

One project was reviewed under this category and the sponsors agreed that project number

36, which is merged with number 44, needed to be discussed further with the project leads.

At Stage 2, the sponsors noted that, due to an injunction, the progress of a pilot scheme had

been impeded but the project is now progressing again with a Defence Forces working group

115


-----

having been re-convened and, with revised timelines and modifications to the Project Plan,

the work will progress in two phases – the first of which deals with officers. The sponsors

agreed that as the project is now progressing, it should be left as a stand-alone project and

that no further action is required. They also agreed that there was no requirement to initiate

Stage 3.

Projects not yet initiated

A total of 19 projects were reviewed under this category and the sponsors agreed that there

was no requirement for 13 of these projects, numbered 37, 38, 40, 43, 49, 50, 54, 58 (linked

with 57), 59, 60, 61, 63 and 64, to be brought forward for further discussion at Stage 2.

However, in relation to project number 37, it was agreed that commencement must await

completion of projects numbered 36 (merged with 44 - see above) and 56 which are both

currently underway. Similarly, in relation to project number 38, it was noted that there are a

number of linkages to other projects and the sponsors agreed that it would be desirable not

to commence this project until number 39 (see Tranche 2 Projects above) has been

completed.

In relation to project number 43, the sponsors noted that some aspects of this are progressing

in any event through IT Carlow and Maynooth University. This progress wouldn’t include,

however, the requirement to consider whether an appropriate balance is being achieved,

including in the context of the need to ensure an appropriate range of training and education

provision.

The sponsors agreed that linked projects, numbered 46, 47 and 48, should be brought forward

to Stage 2, for consideration of possible merger of all three. At Stage 2, following discussion,

it was agreed to leave all three as stand-alone projects for now as, currently, there is no

pressing need for any of the three to be prioritised and, as such, the possibility of a merger

can be considered in the normal course of the White Paper implementation process. The

sponsors also agreed that there was no requirement to initiate Stage 3 in respect of any of

these projects.

116


-----

It was also agreed by the sponsors that, as the current Public Service Stability Agreement will

expire at the end of 2020, consideration should be given to commencement of project

number 49 before then, and perhaps as part of what may become Tranche 3.

Regarding projects numbered 51, 52 and 53, the sponsors agreed that these should be

discussed further with the project leads at Stage 2. In relation to number 51, it was noted at

the Stage 2 meeting that although the project has yet to commence, work on aspects of it are

already happening in the ordinary course of events. As such, it was felt that the requirement

for the project may become moot over time. The meeting also discussed the possibility of a

merger of all three projects. However, it was felt that, as none of these projects are likely to

be earmarked for early commencement, this does not need to be addressed at this time and

can instead be considered in the normal course of the White Paper Implementation process.

It also agreed that there was no requirement to initiate Stage 3 of the process in respect of

any of these projects.

##### Review of Chapter 8 Projects: The Reserve Defence Force (RDF)

Tranche 1/Active Projects

There were no projects for review under this category.

Paused Projects

There was one project, number 70 which is merged with number 71 (and linked to projects

numbered 39 and 72), that fell for review under this category. The sponsors agreed that there

was no requirement to discuss number 70 at Stage 2. They also agreed that this project should

remain paused, at least until project number 39 has closed, as the gaps in the PDF need to be

understood before project work should commence.

Tranche 2 Projects

There were no projects for review under this category.

Closed Projects

There were no projects for review under this category.

117


-----

Merged Projects

One project fell for review under this category. Project number 71 is merged with number 70

which is to remain a paused project (see above).

Projects not yet initiated

A total of 11 projects were reviewed under this category.

The sponsors agreed that there was no requirement to progress projects numbered 69 and

73 to Stage 2 but noted that consideration could be given, in due course, to merging number

69 with other merged RDF projects. The sponsors also agreed that there is no requirement

to discuss project number 72 (linked with number 70) at Stage 2 but decided that projects

numbered 39 and 67 will both need to be concluded before this project can commence.

In relation to projects numbered 65, 66, 67, 68, 74, 75, 76 and 77, the sponsors agreed that

all of these should be discussed at Stage 2 with the project leads in the context of possibly

merging a large number of RDF projects. At the Stage 2 meeting, following discussion in

relation to number 65, the sponsors noted that although this project has not yet commenced

the First Line Reserve is a potential resource identified to address gaps in the Air Corps and

Naval Service and, as such, good progress has been made with certain aspects of this project.

However, the sponsors also noted that this project needs to be considered in the broader

context of the RDF generally and, therefore, the sequencing of work needs to be managed to

avoid duplication or unnecessary overlap. Accordingly, in the first instance, it was agreed that

the project should be merged with number 66.

In relation to number 67, it was noted that an element of this project also relates to the FLR

and that it is, therefore, linked to the newly merged projects numbered 65 and 66. However,

because this project (number 67) is in respect of the entire RDF, it was agreed that it would

not be appropriate to merge all three. The result, however, of merging numbers 65 and 66

will be to offset work involved in number 67 and, as such, the sponsors noted that there will

need to be an awareness of priorities and sequencing of these projects. The sponsors also

agreed that number 75 should merge with number 67 and, as such, this would be the “catch
all” project for the associated legislative requirements of number 65 (which is to be merged

118


-----

with number 66). The question of merging project number 68 with number 67 was also

discussed at Stage 2 but it was agreed to leave these as stand-alone projects, notwithstanding

the civil sponsor’s concerns about resource constraints. There was also discussion about the

continued relevance of number 68 in the context of the current Naval Service Reserve

strength. As regards when this project should commence, it was agreed by the sponsors that

it should be linked with number 39 as the PDF gap analysis project will need to be completed

before work starts on this project. They also agreed that the same applies to project number

74 which will remain as a stand-alone project but will not commence until after number 39

has concluded. The sponsors also agreed, following discussion at Stage 2, to leave projects

numbered 76 and 77 as stand-alone projects.

Finally, they also agreed that there was no requirement to initiate Stage 3 for any of these

projects.

##### Review of Chapter 9 Projects: Civil Defence

Tranche 1/Active Projects

There were no projects for review under this category.

Paused Projects

There were no projects for review under this category.

Tranche 2 Projects

There were no projects for review under this category.

Closed Projects

One project, number 79, fell for review under this category and it was decided that there was

no requirement for this to be discussed further at Stage 2.

Merged Projects

There were no projects for review under this category.

119


-----

Projects not yet initiated

Two projects fell for review under this category and, although project number 78 has not

commenced, it was noted that the Minister is consulting with Civil Defence management and

members. In this context, while it was decided that there was no requirement for this to be

discussed further at Stage 2, it was agreed that this project could be considered for early

commencement.

Similarly, it was also decided that there was no requirement for a Stage 2 meeting for project

number 80 but it was agreed that it should not commence until project number 78 has

concluded, pending decisions on legislative change and subsequent policy direction.

##### Review of Chapter 10 Projects: White Paper Implementation

Tranche 1/Active Projects

Two projects were reviewed under this category. The sponsors agreed that there was no

requirement to give further consideration at Stage 2 to project numbers 84 and 86. However,

as was agreed previously, and subsequently noted by Government in 2018, project number

86 should be finalised after the current White Paper Update has concluded.

Paused Projects

There were no projects for review under this category.

Tranche 2 Projects

One project, number 88, fell for review under this category and the sponsors agreed that

there was no requirement for it to be discussed further at Stage 2. The sponsors noted that

the immediacy of the requirement to commence this project, as identified in the White Paper,

had been overtaken by the subsequent publication, later in 2015, of the Government’s Capital

Investment Plan 2016 to 2021 and further iterations since then, including the National

Development Plan 2018 to 2027 which provides €541m. in capital funding for Defence over

the period to 2022.

120


-----

Closed Projects

There were no projects for review under this category.

Merged Projects

There were no projects for review under this category.

Projects not yet initiated

Five projects were reviewed under this category and the sponsors agreed that there was no

requirement for projects numbered 81, 82, 83, 85 and 87 to be discussed further at Stage 2.

In relation to number 82, the sponsors agreed that a Project Initiation Document needs to be

finalised while, in relation to number 83, they noted a number of positive initiatives and, in

this context, encouraged both Defence Forces Training Branch (J7) and the civil Human

Resources Branch to continue ongoing arrangements and dialogue which should lead to

further initiatives. The sponsors agreed that continued progress in these areas may bring

sufficient momentum to consider commencing this project. The sponsors also agreed that,

in respect of number 87, this Update should note that this project retains its importance

notwithstanding various, and continuing, developments that have occurred, in any event,

meaning that there is now a greater push in this direction at EU level.

121
