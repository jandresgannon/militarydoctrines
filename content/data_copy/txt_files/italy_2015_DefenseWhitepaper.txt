**White Paper: Objectives, Criteria, Lines of Action**

**_Armed Forces: from a joint vision to a joint reality_**

_In entering the new millennium Italy_
_lagged behind on many fronts. Three_
_main areas of concern characterized_
_the sector of international security_
_and defence: political and institutional_
_participation in the defence debate, the_
_structure and functioning of the admi-_
_nistration and the relationship between_
_Italian citizens and Defence. A country_
_that pays no attention to Defence the-_
_mes makes it difficult to intervene on_
_its military to improve it. A political_
_system that steers clear from these pro-_
_blems hampers the establishment of a_
_strong relationship between the people_
_and the Armed Forces, a relationship_
_able to strengthen their sense of be-_
_longing to the national community and their trust in the institutions. So far, these_
_weaknesses have prevented our country from timely and effectively tackling both the_
_modernization of the Defence system and the many challenges we have been con-_
_fronting for a long time. The requirement for a State more capable of protecting our_
_national interests stems from the changes we are witnessing in an ever more complex_
_world. The new millennium, in fact, is especially characterized by two historical_
_changes: globalization and the digital revolution, which nurture an ever stronger_
_interconnection and interdependence between geographical areas, countries, econo-_
_mic sectors, markets and cultures. A farsighted, pragmatic international security and_
_defence policy is of fundamental importance to provide our country with a military_
_able to safeguard our most important achievement, accomplished at the cost of great_


-----

_sacrifices: our freedom. It can, moreover, protect us from risks and possible threats_
_and allow us to tackle our responsibilities within the international community. In the_
_last few years the relevance of those responsibilities has increased in the face of an_
_international scenario where crisis areas have widened, have become more complex_
_and are approaching the European borders._
_New threats - terrorism in the first place, with attacks being now carried out also in_
_our continent- cast their shadow over our freedoms. The Mediterranean area - where_
_our country is historically, politically and economically located- is again attracting_
_international attention because of its many crises and conflicts, to which there seems_
_to be no easy or quick solution. The world has deeply changed and so have many_
_aspects of security that we had taken for granted. Within the framework of the interna-_
_tional institutions that Italy regards as its points of reference -the UN, NATO, the EU-_
_those challenges require a coordinated response from all our national capabilities_
_as well as the availability of effective tools, not least a modern and capable defence_
_system. We must all be aware that the Ministry of Defence and the Armed Forces are_
_important parts of the country and of its public service, especially for the role they_
_play as guarantors of our freedom and strongholds of our national independence._
_Upgrading our capabilities to meet current requirements, improving effectiveness in_
_actions and operations and ensuring overall cost-efficiency are the priority goals to_
_be met by the Ministry of Defence and by the Armed Forces within the framework of_
_the reform process of the State bodies, i.e. the objective identified by this Government_
_since its inception._
_In this perspective, the White Paper submitted by the Government to the other Institu-_
_tions and to the national and international public opinion intends to set short-to-me-_
_dium term objectives, criteria and actions, thus providing our country with an updated_
_defence capacity able to safeguard our interests in cooperation with all the other na-_
_tional instruments. Nevertheless, in Western democratic countries the growing level_
_of insecurity has gone side by side with a decrease in defence investments - due to the_
_financial and economic crisis- and a reduced sensitivity toward defence themes com-_
_pared with other economic and social issues. This trend, which requires a reflection_
_and an adjustment of our Armed Forces, has become evident also in Italy._
_The Armed Forces are a very valuable asset and a capable and effective reality that_


-----

_must be preserved over time and prepared in time. From the very beginning of my_
_mandate, in order to safeguard this valuable asset, I saw the necessity of a White_
_Paper for International Security and Defence that could serve as a guide to adapt the_
_Armed Forces to the new requirements, and to foster greater awareness in our country_
_about security and defence being common assets and indispensable conditions for the_
_development of our society. This was also the reason why I decided that the drafting of_
_the White Paper should be open to the contributions of all the parties interested in our_
_defence system and to the public opinion._
_Many innovations have been introduced over the last fifteen years. As a consequence,_
_the Armed Forces have changed by adopting a professional model that is more agile,_
_fully gender-equal and increasingly integrated at the international level, evolving to-_
_ward the joint organizational structure provided for in the Defence reform started by_
_former Defence Minister Andreatta._
_The Government intends to finalize the Defence reform process while removing un-_
_necessary bureaucratic structures and unproductive duplications, and changing all_
_organizational or managerial solutions that do not appropriately justify their cost. On_
_the other hand, it’s worth underscoring that in the last few years the Defence has alrea-_
_dy done a great deal in terms of expenditure cuts and rationalization. It suffices to note_
_that the Ministry has been the “first contributor” in reducing current expenditures, has_
_already introduced various organizational simplifications and finally, based on Law_
_n° 244/2012, has, of its own initiative, cut its personnel by about 25%, lowering the_
_number of the military from 190,000 to 150,000 and that of civilian employees from_
_30,000 to 20,000._
_The transformation process, however, is not over, since our future defence requires_
_the Armed Forces to think and operate as a single instrument, where their individual_
_traditions, specificities and different capabilities become the strongpoint of their unity,_
_rather than a weakness resulting in their separation. In brief, we must move from a_
_“joint vision” to a fully joint “reality”. Thus, we will be able to employ and integrate_
_new technologies and make our decisional processes, so effective and efficient in our_
_out-of -area operations, as effective and efficient across the whole spectrum of our_
_activities and sectors of intervention, from procurement to infrastructures, doctrine,_
_recruitment, logistics and training._


-----

_This new, more effective military must be employed carefully, on the basis of our stra-_
_tegic priorities. Italy is a country with an exceptionally rich experience and great_
_abilities that have allowed it to work hard and well at international level. Moreover,_
_our geopolitical position, at the centre of the Mediterranean basin, offers many op-_
_portunities, but also unavoidable obligations. Italy is able and willing to cover a_
_recognized position of responsibility in its area of interest and, according to its me-_
_ans and resources and in harmony with the International Community, to contribute to_
_peace-establishment and regional development._
_In this perspective, the Defence will put its multiple abilities at the service of the Count-_
_ry, in order to understand, prevent, tackle and solve crises, and to develop a network of_
_relationships able to foster the stabilization process in the Mediterranean area._
_As an asset of the country, the Armed Forces are and will always be at the service of_
_the community, when performing both their institutional and support tasks, tackling_
_all kinds of emergency situations._
_Together with the priority lines of action illustrated above, we must also provide new_
_policies aimed at supporting innovation and scientific and technological research. An_
_effective security and defence policy, in fact, must maintain appropriate technological_
_and industrial capabilities, able to meet at least part of our requirements. To achieve_
_this objective, close cooperation between the Defence and industry, as well as univer-_
_sities and research centres, will be the keystone of future action, hopefully also in view_
_of the European integration process._
_The establishment of a virtuous relationship between the conversion of military requi-_
_rements into specific technologies and products and the final users will strengthen the_
_competitiveness of the “national system” ensuring jobs, technological innovation and_
_industrial development that will benefit the whole community. Our future Armed Forces_
_will therefore have to be young, well trained, motivated and appropriately remunerated._
_Our military, our defence professionals, will ensure the country the best possible defen-_
_ce framework, implementing their tasks by using modern tools within a functional and_
_essential operational structure, working effectively, with a spirit of sacrifice._
_As citizens who, to comply with the oath they took when they joined the Armed Forces,_
_cope with a difficult life, sacrificing their affections and their rights, our men and_
_women in uniform, as well as their families, will never lack respect, support and a fair_


-----

_social treatment._
_This perspective and this spirit are the basis of the White Paper’s strategic analysis_
_and design synthesis._
_The strategic guidelines illustrated in this foreword are therefore the political gui-_
_dance needed to develop implementation solutions. In particular, since strategies are_
_worth nothing without the tools needed to implement them, this White Paper is to be_
_followed by concrete legislative and regulatory proposals and a Defence strategic_
_review which will outline how the future Armed Forces will be shaped and equipped_
_to effectively tackle possible risks and current and medium-term threats._
_Finally, let me thank all the military and civilian experts who have worked with me_
_for more than a year: their commitment has been crucial to drafting and publishing_
_this White Paper._
_I hope that this paper will now foster renewed attention toward the Defence, and the_
_necessary support for the ambitious review project outlined in it._

Capitolo

**Why a white paper?**

# 1

**1. Today we are all living in a**
global environment that has become extraordinarily complex,
difficult to understand and uncertain in its development. The
80’s of the last century ended
with the conclusion of the historic period known as “bipolar
confrontation” and with a new
hope in the beginning of a global process toward peaceful coexistence, in which the
international crises would have been resolved through the masterly use of diplomacy,
economy and international organizations.

**2. However, the following twenty years demonstrated that this was an optimistic fore-**
cast. In a very short space of time, stable areas of the world became the scene of horrendous atrocities and crimes against humanity, we believed had been buried forever.
At the same time, crisis situations existing before the “Cold War” were rekindled and
intensified, generating effects in neighbouring areas. The start of the process of globalization has brought wealth and development in many areas, but it has also created
strong social disparities, transfers of wealth and productive tools. Aspirations towards
democratic and participatory social models haves shaped a new generation of people,
who have thus become aware of their traditions, rights and values, but it has started
at the same time the resurgence of nationalism and conflicts based on intolerance, religion and competition for primary resources. The revolution started with IT and new
technologies seemed to offer mankind the chance to obtain more from the planet, but
it also has had to face a growing awareness of the difficulties involved in sustaining


-----

such models requiring the intensive exploitation of resources, the control of which
provokes new situations of crisis and conflict.

**3. It is not possible to predict what effects will result from these premises in the future,**
but a tendency towards widespread instability certainly looks set to remain at least in
the near future. The dynamics of this instability, on the contrary, seem to be more and
more violent and less confined to the places where they were generated. Phenomena
such as the Caliphate and the destabilization of important neighbouring regions for
social, economic, health or religious reasons, as well as the more traditional politics
of power, require us to look at these events with concern. Concern that arises from
the knowledge that we must ensure in the long term, with our allies, a condition of
sufficient deterrence, functional in preventing future conflicts in the Euro-Atlantic
and Euro-Mediterranean regions. We must take the responsibility for forecasting,
preventing and, if necessary, managing events generated by situations of instability
in terms of threats and attacks on our
national integrity, our sovereignty and
our vital interests, without excluding
the risks generated by mass migration,
pandemics, terrorism and crime.

**4.** In this perspective, the “defence
function” and its operational component represented by the military, is
an essential element of the national
system which protects and guarantees
our freedom. Freedom obtained from
the sacrifice of past generations, which is an essential and necessary condition to safeguard free institutions and citizens’ rights.

**5. Therefore faced with a situation of increasing international instability and insecu-**
rity, there is now a great need for Italy to deal rationally and methodically with the
problem of national security and defence, as well as with foresight, not just by mana

-----

ging sudden events appropriately, but by developing a broader comprehensive strategy
involving all the capabilities of our society. The defence of the State, in fact, cannot
and should not be limited exclusively to the indispensable action of the Armed Forces.
It must be a unicum in which every segment of society, according to aptitude and
ability, contributes to the creation of the broad and coordinated security framework
that is a real guarantee of freedom for our nation.

**6. This challenge requires the Government and Parliament to examine major national**
security and defence issues, in order to define a structured National Security Strategy
that is able to cope with and manage the security problems Italy will have to face in
the future, in a coordinated and synergistic way.

**7. In addition, the intense activity carried out by the Defence in theatres of interven-**
tion means that renewed attention needs to be given to the “command of the armed
forces”, in particular during military operations and especially in the light of the many
tasks undertaken in support of the international stability in recent decades. Leaving
aside the functions of the constitutional authorities, it seems useful to reflect on the
adequacy of the governing bodies and their related support structures, developed over
the years to deal with situations of crisis or emergency. Their functioning, in fact,
is strongly influenced by both the limited scope given to them at the time of their
foundation, and the absence of specific primary legislation outlining their powers and
configuration. It is, therefore, appropriate to study new solutions in order to ensure
the rightful position of the delicate decision-making process relating to the exercise
of military force, in compliance with the mandatory constitutional principles and the
inescapable demands of timeliness and effectiveness.

**8. The strategic analysis and design of this White Paper within this context and from**
this perspective has the threefold purpose of:

-  indicating, in the medium-term, which military component can best address the
challenges and opportunities that are relevant to the Ministry of Defence in terms of
international security and defence;

-  identifying which model of governance and consequent organization can best gua

-----

rantee the Ministry its compliance with modern criteria of effectiveness, efficiency
and economy, to allow the Defence to successfully face the challenges of today and
tomorrow;

-  developing cultural and organizational elements that enable the Defence to contribute systematically to the Nation’s effort to develop the necessary framework of security
previously referred to.

**9. The elements contained in this White Paper are the basis for the development of**
solutions to be implemented and which will have to be refined and developed quickly,
according to the indications outlined in the final chapter.

The military, security and defence

**10. The Italians of our generation have experienced a long period in which it was**
possible to take advantage of a wide security framework and during which the participation in international efforts for peace and stability was a question of “choice”.
Under In the current situation it is important not to underestimate the fact that direct
involvement in some of the current or potential crises could become an unavoidable
commitment. It is therefore necessary to prevent the occurrence of such situations and
take appropriate action in the event of failure, in order to contain them - before they
become too big to be faced with only limited sacrifice.

**11. The financial and economic crisis and the need to contain the public debt, however,**
do not allow the country to provide in the short term, all the resources that would
be needed to address these challenges with all the right tools and in all situations.
Through a wise choice and use of the tools that are available, we need to identify the
correct priorities for action and the most appropriate ways of intervening to ensure the
achievement of the strategic objectives that are being pursued.

**12.** Secondly, it is necessary to summarize two requirements: the preparations necessary to deal with an immediate crisis involving the nation and the preservation,


-----

in a broader perspective and in the longterm, of the ability to deal with situations
of traditional conflict. The latter case, is
perceived as less likely today, but cannot
be neglected because it can affect vital
national interests, including the very survival of the State, more than any other
circumstance.

**13. Finally, we need to understand in what way and to what extent the different inter-**
national organizations of which Italy is a member, contribute to international security
and the defence of the nation. Membership of the Atlantic Alliance is vital for the organisation’s strategic function and is also useful in reducing the overall impact of the
defence function on the national budget. From this viewpoint it is necessary to assess
the way in which this participation deals with the fair division of responsibilities, in
proportion to the overall potentiality of the country. Participation in the process of European integration in the field of defence, on the other hand, means that it is necessary
to think about the question of what legal and political instruments must be developed
in order to produce more security. The need to contribute to the peace initiatives of the
United Nations, makes it necessary to provide all those activities which can render the
role of the nation credible within the organisation.

Internal reform in the Ministry of Defence

**14. The ministry of Defence is facing an historic moment characterized by complex**
and pressing needs, which require fast, effective action in order to preserve, and in
the longer term to strengthen, the fundamental function that it expresses. At the same
time, the government is aiming at a broad reform of the public administration, in order
to provide the State with modern tools for the development of the activities. In order to
respect the specific features associated with the functions to be performed, it is therefore in the interest of the country that the Defence is included in this period of reform.


-----

**15. Furthermore, it should be noted how the military has undergone various changes in**
the last twenty years in order to respond to multiple contingent needs. The recent law
No. 244, 2015, however, has significantly decreased the numbers of the armed forces
to about 25 % of the original size, and introduced new organisational changes. It is therefore evident that a more systematic and comprehensive review of the governance of
the Defence is needed, which, in the spirit and full implementation of 1997 Andreatta
reform, can lead to a truly integrated structure distinguished by greater efficiency and
effectiveness and especially by economy of operation.

**16. Personnel is one of the most important issues for Defence. Over the last two de-**
cades important reforms have been carried out, such as the suspension of compulsory military service and the introduction of a “professional model”, as well as the
introduction of military service for women. Today, on the basis of this experience
and partial legislative adaptations, it has become clear that systematic revision is necessary in order to renew, balance and simplify, both the legislation which regulates
the enlistment process and career progression, as well as the measures that define the
general legal framework of reference for staff.

**17. Finally, the need for a more coordinated and transparent leadership requires some**
changes in decision-making and internal operations, to ensure a more effective political management of the ministry and better interconnection with other ministries,
as part of a united action by the government and conducted by the presidency of the
council of ministers. With regards to cooperation between the institutions, it also appears necessary to investigate how to improve communication with regional and local
authorities. Using Defence not only for military action and intervention, but also in
the case of major catastrophes, for example, means that it is necessary to think about
the need for integration and coordination with local authorities and public functions
located in the autonomous system that will be developed.


-----

Defence and the State

**18. The function performed by the Defence is part of the constitution and it is funda-**
mental to the State for its preservation and creates the security framework that is indispensable for the development of the nation. During periods of crisis and transition,
like the one we are experiencing, it is nevertheless necessary to further strengthen the
vital links that should always exist between the ministry of Defence and the other
ministries, between the armed forces and other State capabilities and between the military and the rest of the citizens, to achieve that interdependency between the different
parts of the same organism which is essential to the life of our community.

**19. It is essential for our nation to better understand the duties, functions and features**
of the Defence and of the “citizens in uniform” who serve their country, in order
to ensure full knowledge of the facts, the requirements, advantages and the possible
correlated risks. On this basis the citizens and their elected representatives will be able
to make rational and well-informed decisions and fully accept responsibility in the
critical sector of Defence. Communication between the government and parliament is
essential to this process and new ways of providing information and communicating
will need to be developed in accordance with their constitutional powers.

**20. Addressing the problem of national security and defence from a modern perspec-**
tive requires a comprehensive and multi-disciplinary approach. It is necessary to think
about how the various capabilities which make the country safer can be developed
and if the concept of “defence” can evolve, become broader, including all the different
perspectives and skills involved in it. This concept, moreover, integrates well with the
innovations launched by the government for the reforming the so-called “third sector”,
in particular with regards to the role and functions of National Civil Service. In this
effort, the underlying connecting element of the evolution is represented by the shared
values which permeate the very existence of our nation.

**21. A real sharing of the same framework of values between citizens and their armed**
forces requires constant communication and assiduous interaction between the parties,


-----

who make transparency, public interest and constructive criticism the basis of the trusting relationship which should always exist between institutions and citizens.

**22. With the intention of contributing to the effort made by the entire national commu-**
nity, this paper intends to give a precise and decisive impetus to the transformation of
the military in terms of greater efficiency, effectiveness and economy of management.
This is both the starting point for a complex reform and adaptation of our armed forces, and the basis for initiating a broad and mature reflection on the issues of international security and defence. The historical period in which we are living demands all
that. Also the citizens who daily observe serious international events are requesting it.
As a government it is our duty as a government to make every effort to address these
problems with determination and give the best possible answers in the interest of the
nation.

**Strategic Framework**
# 2

The evolution of the strategic
scenario

**23.** International relations are highly
complex due to the interconnection of
a number of factors and actors. This
means that the system as a whole is both dynamic and strong, but it is also vulnerable
because disruption and crisis spread easily and quickly. Italy is deeply rooted in the
international system from every point of view with advantages and benefits gained
from this strong interconnection. Italy also provides a lot of support, in fact nation
could be considered as a substantial actor in terms of technology and commerce as
well as in terms of knowledge and culture.

**24.** Moreover, Italy has developed awareness due to the increasing interaction and
interdependence with the rest of the world, considering also its geographical position
and the dependence on foreign countries for the supply of resources. As a consequence, the effects on Italy are almost social, cultural, and economic or it may give the rise
to political phenomena altering the existing global and regional balance.

**25. Italy’s general policy and particularly its defence policy, cannot therefore be sepa-**
rated from a broad and diverse vision of ongoing problems and global dynamics,  with
multiple dimensions.. The option represented by a defence policy focused entirely
on some specific geographic areas or on some defined risk factors does not appear
consistent with the strategic needs of a nation so deeply integrated in global dynamics.
On the other hand, given the actual size of the nation and its overall interests, strict


-----

realism in setting priorities and in choosing intervention tools is required. Choices
reflecting a “non- realistic” approach to the problems of international security would
result in a significant waste of resources with the consequence of less protecting
national interests.

**26. Therefore, this White Paper had to evolve from a preliminary identification of**
the most significant factors characterizing the current international environment with
major trends influencing its evolution. This effort was necessary not only to propose a
predictive and deterministic model of future threats or risks to national security, but rather to reduce the level of unpredictability and uncertainty of the analysis, identifying
a more precise reference environment within which different choices can be made.

**27. The guidelines to this document stated that the current period is distinguished by**
two and concomitant geopolitical phenomena: a progressive globalization of phenomena and problems, which tends to turn the world into a highly interconnected and
interdependent “global village” at least for that part of the world with a high level
of interdependence, and a parallel process of fragmentation, which causes structural
weakening and destabilisation especially in weaker or newly constituted states.

**28. The current international situation is characterized by frequently widespread in-**
stability overshadowed by conflicts not always restrained, which are triggered by political, social, economic, environmental or religious factors. This is more likely in areas
suffering from socio-economic problems or areas deprived of traditional references,
leadership and stability due to the post-Cold War process of global transformation.
Several factors influence the future international security scenario and to encourage
new situations of instability in addition to those ones still unresolved from the last
century. Some of the most relevant are the following.

**29.** **Variation of the global balance of power. The gradual formation of a new world**
equilibrium on a poly-centric basis, or according to some, on an a-centric and regional
basis, resulting from the affirmation of new emerging powers, could lead, even in the
medium term, to new political, economic or military challenges. Hence the possible


-----

rising of new conflicts, maybe localized carrying a potential significant impact for our
nation, Europe and the Atlantic Alliance. In a global context, traditional wars between
states over control of resources or due to the resurgence of unresolved situations could
cause a domino effect of widening the crisis. At the regional level, changes in the
balance of power, such as those produced by conflict in the Euro-Atlantic region, the
weakening or ineffectiveness of the Atlantic Alliance and the imbalance between the
defence resources and the security challenges, may mean that new conflict are more
probable.

**30.** **Changes in political structures. These changes seem to slow down the process**
which has characterised last decade that is the gradual transition from autocratic or illiberal regimes to forms of government with greater democracy. However, even though
many populations are now aware that they can aspire to democracy, the real possibility
of attaining a democratic system is not always guaranteed in a growing number of
cases. This situation, exacerbated by economic and social crises, can lead to internal
instability and civil wars in countries apparently stable today.

**31. Increased influence and widespread technologies. The current speed of research**
and use of technologies, together with the innovation process resulting from the integrated use of existing and emerging technologies, will lead to a faster rate of change.
Likewise, the traditional margin of technological superiority held by the military has
been eroded in favour of technologies for civilian use. The latter are often available at
a lower cost resulting in wider access to even the most sophisticated technology. This
will increase the possibility of technology being used by non-state actors to offend
enemies or opponents, thus significantly decreasing state control and prevention.

**32. The centrality of computer networks. The world is becoming increasingly con-**
nected and integrated making possible a universal access to knowledge and information. The West is particularly dependent on information network systems, so that it
is essential that these systems are functional, secure and resilient and this results in
the emergence of a new operational domain, the cybernetic domain, which must be
protected and defended. The effects of cyber-attacks on networks or computer services


-----

are particularly destructive for Western countries producing the same impact as those
resulting from the war fought with conventional weapons.

**33. Demographic changes. Demographic evolution will produce a variety of effects**
on our society regarding the economy, the social environment and security. With regard
to international security and defence issues, widespread poverty, high unemployment
rates and a relatively low level of education in many countries produce social tension
and migratory pressure, which may cause difficulties even in the countries objective
of such exoduses. In Europe reduced birth rates and ageing populations could lead to
tensions between generations as well as having an impact on the availability of young,
qualified personnel for building security and defence structures.

**34. Urbanization. It is estimated that in 2040, 65% of the world population will live in**
large built up areas and that 95 % of the increase in urban population will occur in the
mega-cities of the developing countries. This process will have a significant impact
on the dynamics of security management in those states. Because of the inability to
ensure the basic needs of the population in these areas, the possibility of conflicts will
be increased. It will also be more difficult for military or police distinguish between
combatants and armless citizens.

**35. Scarcity of natural resources. Nations in the developing world need ever increa-**
sing levels of energy and raw materials to sustain their growth. Competition for these
resources could produce a higher level of international tension leading to possible
conflicts. However, the increasing scarcity of vital resources such as water and food
due to population growth, climate change and an irrational use of territories is a much
more serious problem. It is the cause of the migration phenomena and could pave the
way to strong competition, even armed, for the possession of such resources.

**36. Climate change.** Changes in the global climate have a growing impact on our
increasingly urbanized societies dependent on territories where human intervention
has profoundly altered the existing natural balance. In this situation, the results of natural phenomena such as disasters will have devastating effects. In addition, disasters

of a large magnitude could allow opportunistic actors to gain political, financial and
economic advantages in the international arena, resulting in weakening our societies.

**37. The globalisation of financial resources.** Financial systems, which handle the
most important resources of the planet, tend to be increasingly interconnected and not
related to specific states, sometimes resulting in a decrease of sovereignty in many
countries when having some difficulties managing a home crisis through traditional
means and in the increase number of actors involved in each specific crisis situation.

**38. Local Identities. The progressive birth of local different groups or organisations**
causes an increasing weakening and fragmentation of existing states, which are unable
to centrally manage the twenty-first century complex phenomenon. In some cases, this
weakness opens the way to non-state transnational religious or criminal organisations.
The violence and diffusion rate of such organisations have a significant impact on
the condition of regional or global security. The effects of such conflicts could lead
to attacks on critical infrastructures, to forced changes in the political equilibrium
and could jeopardise the flow of trade and energy. The consequences arising from the
possession of chemical, bacteriological, radiological or nuclear offensive tools are
particularly serious in these territories. Even the threat of using these kinds of weapons
could have serious political, social and economic consequences.

**39. Decrease in defence investment.** This phenomenon is common in the western
world while the opposite is true in the rest of the world, particularly in relation to
regional powers. For Western countries, the reduction in military spending is the result
of a widespread diminished awareness regarding the importance of the defence issues
compared to other economic and social problems. If this trend continues, the capacity
to prevent and deter will diminish in western countries, while the level of possible
risks and threats to security will increase, and the overall ability to defend both vital
and strategic interests and the values on which our democratic structures are based,
will be compromised.


-----

Security of the Euro-Atlantic region

**40. The Euro-Atlantic region is defined by the common values and democratic beliefs**
of the states of the community and not by geographical boundaries. Since the end of
World War II the relationship between European nations and North American nations
has been one of the most solid and enduring pillars of the global equilibrium. It has
also taken the shape of a military alliance - the Atlantic Pact - but since the beginning
it has in fact been, a much broader and deeper relationship.

**41. The relationship is based on shared values on both sides of the Atlantic, irrespec-**
tive of language. It is the result of the mingling the respective economies that has no
equal in any other sphere of relations between nations. It was one of the driving factors
behind European integration unifying a group of nations while leaving behind the divisions of the past and seeking together the realization of fundamental western values:
freedom, peace, prosperity and development. From an economic point of view the
Euro-Atlantic area is vital for Italy: 68% of imports and 75% of national trade exports
are in this area that is without mentioning the high level of industrial interdependence
that already exists and the strategic network of joint technological research activities
and professional training.

**42. It is therefore clear that the Euro-Atlantic region security, being the focus of national**
interests, is top priority for the nation. According with our Constitution, the defence of
the nation is a fundamental duty of every citizen, and it is therefore also obtained through
the defence of peace and stability in the Euro-Atlantic region. Within this framework,
full national commitment to the Atlantic Alliance for the development of a gradual integration process of the European Union nations defences are the cornerstones for the
protection, even in the future, of security and national defence and involve not only
benefits but also specific obligations and expenses.


-----

Security of the Euro-Mediterranean region

**43. The geographical location, economic-trade flows and also the interconnection of**
cultural history, place our nation at the centre of a large and complex geopolitical area,
with its own clearly defined characteristics known as the Euro-Mediterranean
area. It is made up of very different
political, social, economic, cultural and
religious systems. The area is unified
through the sharing of the Mediterranean basin.

**44. The Mediterranean basin joins five areas each bearing different characteristics: the**
European Union countries, the Balkans, the Black Sea, the Mediterranean area of the
Middle East and the Maghreb. In some of these areas, fundamental economic, political and social unrest gave rise to new and violent criminality as well as bloody civil
wars. Terrorism and transnational uprisings have taken root: illegal immigration and
militant proselytizing are seen as a potential means of expansion into Europe. These
issues and the dependence on some of these countries for energy, make the stability of
the Euro-Mediterranean region of vital national interest.

**45.** It is precisely in the Euro-Mediterranean region that traditional state structures
are weakening and social and cultural models in alternative to democracy are being
pursued. In recent times, this phenomenon has been exacerbated by the birth of some
groups, taking control over entire areas exercising civil, military, economic and judicial power. Moreover, the use of globalized information allows these groups to successfully export their own model, with consequent spreading rapidly of their belief,
easily replicated even at great geographical distance.

**46. The evolution of terrorism aiming only at undermining the solidity of existing**
institutions to  fully and officially replace them is particularly alarming. Terrorism
which can rely on state-type support, albeit unrecognised by the international com

-----

munity, has then evolved from a condition in which concealment is necessary, to
one which openly challenges the institutions as well as the local, regional and global
equilibrium.

**47. The threat posed by actors capable of successfully combining transnational ter-**
rorist, criminal, military and media actions, means that the traditional concepts of
“security” and “defence” are outdated and leads to a progressive development of the
tools necessary to address the problems of internal security and external defence. This
transformation creates a need for broader integrated intergovernmental response capabilities, of which the military is still an essential element.

**48. The complexity of the situations and the diversity of the actors in this area mean**
that a stable and effective regional security system is not feasible at the moment. At the
same time, the geographical proximity and the direct influence on Italy of the events
developing in this area, make it impossible to ignore the way various situations of
crisis and conflict are evolving. These situations, if not properly addressed and settled,
could further jeopardize the regional and already fragile security.

**49. In this context, it is therefore vital for our national interest to work towards en-**
suring the Euro-Mediterranean region development of greater stability, economic
progress and respect for fundamental human rights, within which the process of democratic competition can replace that of confrontational opposition. However, the
current situation demonstrates how these conditions are still well out of reach. It is
therefore necessary for the nation to assume more responsibility and a role of active
participation in the efforts of the international community to resolve these crises.

**50.** In short, it is not possible for Italy to separate the safety of the Euro-Mediterranean region from that of the Euro-Atlantic, as they are both essential
and complementary elements in the framework of national security and defence.
Whilst in the Euro-Atlantic context the participation in established mechanisms
of prevention, deterrence and collective defence (Atlantic Alliance and the European Union) ensures that the Nation’s security conditions are adequate, it is


-----

only possible to create similar conditions in the Euro-Mediterranean region if an
intervention in this area is given national priority.

**51. The Euro-Mediterranean region, however, is not a closed system and it is influen-**
ced by the dynamics occurring particularly in adjacent areas. . It is not possible to deal
with crisis situations developing in areas of direct interest without a broader understanding of their causes. It is fundamental the involvement in initiatives aimed at their
resolution. In order to protect national interests and to strengthen the framework of
security and defence, areas of particular interest are the Mashriq, the Sahel, the Horn
of Africa and the countries of the Persian Gulf:
**a. The Mashreq**
The term Mashreq, is understood to be synonymous
with “non-Maghreb”, it generally identifies all the
Arab countries that lie east of Cairo. It is therefore the
eastern macro-region of the Arab Muslim world. Its
instability has been increased over the past two decades due to widespread conflict both internally in some countries, and transnationally,
due to economic, political, social and religious factors. The possibility that significant
phenomena of a terrorist nature could destabilize the regions closest to us, if not even
hit national territory, clearly indicates that it is necessary to participate in the international community efforts for better conditions of peace and regional stability in
this area, through the wise use of all the tools available and in accordance with the
legitimate governments wishes of the nations involved.
**b. The Sahel**
The Sahel is a strip of land in sub-Saharan Africa that stretches from the Sahara desert
to the north and the savannah of the Sudan to the south, and between the Atlantic
Ocean to the west and the Red Sea to the east. It is
an area of limited economic development with areas
of extreme poverty continuously affected by religious
and tribal conflicts. In these countries, the lack of state
structures able to guarantee internal security leads to
the possible causes of instability in the Mediterranean


-----

area, such as mass migration, illegal trafficking and international terrorism. There
is also concern about the development and spread of pandemics, even if the current
national system of prevention and control has proven to be effective. In this case the
active involvement of Italy in international humanitarian missions or missions which
contribute to stabilising the area could also be necessary.
**c. The Horn of Africa**
The Horn of Africa is traditionally an area of national
presence, being facilitated and stimulated by the cultural proximity of local populations with our country.
Also the strategic position of the area is a crossroads
for maritime trade flows to and from the Mediterranean region. The political and social stability of the
area and the creation of better living conditions for the
population are of significant relevance, albeit indirectly, for the security of the Mediterranean region, preventing the resurgence of phenomena such as piracy, reducing
emigration to Europe and preventing the area from becoming fertile ground for the
expansion of extremist religious terrorist groups. In the same way as the Sahel, this
is an area in which Italy could be actively involved for humanitarian missions or
missions contributing to the stabilization of the area.
**d. The Persian Gulf region**
The region of the countries on the Persian Gulf is of
particular strategic importance, since a significant part
of world production and trade of oil products still occurs in this area. Furthermore, some countries are also
active and important actors in the dynamics that could
affect the stability of the Mediterranean region and are
important partners for our country. For these reasons there is national and international
interest in the stability of the area and in maintaining the trade flows that are developed within it.


-----

Global security

**52. As an important member of the international community, Italy with its global economic**
perspective and global political interests is both capable and eager to play internationally
a role of responsibility, acting to help ensure peace and development, according to its resources. In this endeavour, Italy attaches fundamental importance to the role of the wider
international community, with the United Nations as the global organization of reference
providing the possibility of developing joint actions with existing multinational organizations. Italy is fully aware that only joint action with other nations can realistically lead to
the desired goals. As a result, over the years, Italy has developed a deep interconnection
and, in some cases, interdependence with many countries, maintaining an extensive network of economic, political, cultural and military relations, even outside our regional area.
**53. The wider security of national interests therefore requires Italy to actively share the**
responsibility of the process initiated by the international community aiming to create
better living conditions, peace and development for all the populations of the world. Therefore, as part of a multidimensional approach and in accordance with the opportunities
and priorities, the nation will operate, not only for the protection of national interests, but
also for the protection and defence of populations in crisis areas and for the development
and promotion of higher levels of security and global stability.

Capitolo

**International Security and Defence Policy**

# 3

National interests and objectives

**54. The ultimate goal of the national policy of international security and defence is the**
protection of Italy’s vital and strategic interests. To reach this objective the defence of
the State and its sovereignty must be ensured, the construction of a stable framework
of regional security must be pursued and efforts must be made to facilitate the creation
of a favourable international environment. Although a multitude of Intergovernmental
Action can be implemented by the government to achieve these objectives, the ability
of the armed forces to defend Italy and its interests remains central.

**55. In the last twenty years, in fact, the participation of the Defence in multinational mi-**
litary operations has reinforced Italy’s international role. This allowed us to strengthen
our relations within the alliances and develop new ones, also with emerging actors.
Italy has provided considerable commitment in terms of human and material resources


-----

and such commitment has also been paid for with a high tribute in blood. The armed
forces have demonstrated that they can work effectively even in harsh environments.
In line with the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and International Cooperation, the action
of the armed forces has thus helped to strengthen, the role of Defence as the primary
actor in the context of international security to the benefit of the “national system”.

**56.** As set out in the Guidelines to this document, Italy’s role in the world is determined
by our vital and strategic interests as a nation
and as a prominent member of the international community. In fact, these two factors are
closely linked, because national interests also
have an international dimension. These roles
and interests must also be seen in relation to the
fact that the country is an integral part of the
global system both in terms of contributing to
and being on the receiving end of the limits and
constraints of the system itself.

**57.** Italy is one of the largest, leading European countries and one of the founding
members of the European Union. Our social, political and economic future is certainly
anchored to Europe and its future. Our security interests largely coincide with those
of other European partners and it is therefore vital for Italy to preserve the security
and stability of the European continent and the transatlantic spaces. This goal can be
pursued by ensuring the effectiveness of the European Union and Atlantic Alliance as
collective political and military tools, able to protect that interest.

**58. Italy values the strengthening of EU Common Security and Defence Policy stra-**
tegic and for this reason actively promotes the development of the role of Europe in
a way that requires more integration of resources and capabilities among member
countries. For example government action for further development of incentives and
innovative approaches to defence cooperation, which also involves studying tax me

-----

asures that do not distort the market and includes consideration of the idea that some
of Defence investments could be excluded from the thresholds of the Stability and
Growth Pact. Transatlantic relations will be infused with new energy due to a closer
understanding between European defence and NATO, overcoming the influences that
still lead to a preference for bilateral relations over multilateral ones.

**59. National interests, however, are not confined to Europe, which has mainly a tran-**
sformation economy. Much of the possibility for a national development depends on
the ability to attract foreign investment and international trade. We are reliant on international trade for many primary natural resources without which the possibility of
sustaining national and economic development would be severely compromised.

**60. Our economic interests, our particularly rich and complex history and our geopo-**
litical position provide other responsibilities and opportunities. Italy is a member of
several international organizations and has developed multiple and important bonds
of friendship and cooperation with many countries. Lastly, Italy, as an open society,
influences and is also influenced by global events and trends.

**61. Ensuring the defence of the homeland, maritime and air space, our freedom, the**
safety of our citizens and the future well-being of our country are not neglected. But
this is dependent on widespread global stability, on the existence of an international
system that safeguards respect for the freedom and fundamental rights of people and
on global economic development. These conditions cannot be separated from the willingness and the national capacity to know how to fit into this system with credibility
and authority, and from actively participating in the preservation and strengthening
of the system. This network of international, political, economic, technological and
cultural relations is part of the Nation’s heritage and it cannot be taken for granted,
but rather must be constantly reinforced with long-term choices, which are consistent
over time.

**62. Our ability and willingness to invest in international security, however, must take**
into account the real overall possibilities of the nation, the economic and financial


-----

circumstances and the need to have a military component which is able to meet the
priority needs of national defence. Clear priorities must therefore guide our choices
in terms of allocation of resources for the acquisition, preparation, readiness and deployment of forces.

**63. The nation has traditionally managed this situation of geopolitical uncertainty by**
providing a balanced military component, with multiple and valuable capabilities. It is
obvious that financial resources are now an unavoidable constraint and that Italy will
no longer be able to respond autonomously to all future security and defence needs.

**64. This White Paper outlines new and realistic objectives for international security**
and defence which guide the action of the Ministry in an innovative way and facilitate
the integration of the resources potentially provided by all the institutional actors. As
was mentioned in Guidelines to this document, the new structure for national security
and defence will be based on three points:
**European integration. National defence will be combined in primis with other EU**
partners. Although this involves a progressive and marked interdependence as well as
a sharing of sovereignty, these nations are a rational choice and a political priority both
for greater integration in the field of security and defence, and for the development of
more structured and stronger but not exclusive cooperation with countries closer to us
in terms of interests, historical and cultural ties and reference values.
**Transatlantic cohesion. The transatlantic community is the second and biggest gua-**
rantee for the defence of the nation. NATO, which has guaranteed peace in the EuroAtlantic area for nearly sixty years, remains the reference organization for this community. NATO has evolved over time, taking on a different, larger role, but it remains
central to the context of collective defence. To date, only the Alliance between North
America and Europe is able to dissuade, deter and provide military defence against
any kind of threat.
**Global relations. Italy is an active member of the international community and parti-**
cipates in the inter-relational dynamics that are developed in this area both bilaterally
and multilaterally. It recognizes the UN as the main and unavoidable reference for
legitimacy, in particular with regards to issues of international security.


-----

**65. The following paragraphs contain precise guidelines to define roles and operating**
modes, as well as the quantity and quality the country intends to provide in order
to implement international security and defence policies in the defined domains of
action. As illustrated throughout the document, this definition will be part of a “Strategic Review” in preparation for the start of a new cycle of planning by technical and
operational bodies that will lead to a new 15 year programme.

A more secure nation

**66. The priority objective for the protection of Italy’s vital interests is defence against**
an armed attack directed at national territory, its people and its assets. This includes
potential hybrid attacks by non-state actors who possess substantial offensive capabilities, including weapons of mass destruction.

**67. This will be prevented by two lines of action. The first, at an intergovernmental**
level, consists of developing the ability to use all the available tools to create an international situation to prevent this risk. The second consists of preserving multi-faceted
capabilities of conventional deterrence, proportionate to the size of the real threat, and
capable of deterring potential hostile entities. This last capability will be developed
within the framework of NATO’s integrated defence policy and in the context of the
Common European Security and Defence Policy. Deficiencies in collective defence
capabilities, identified by the European Union and NATO, will therefore be national
priorities, as will the availability of a capacity for independent first response intervention and for the defence of national territory, areas of maritime access to the territory
and air defence.

**68. In addition to these more traditional capabilities, the Defence in accordance with**
the national policy on information security will develop defence against cyber-attacks
that may exceed the capabilities prepared by civilian agencies. Similarly, it will contribute more effectively to safeguarding freedom of access to space and the depths of
the sea.


-----

A more secure Euro-Atlantic region

**69. The size of the Euro-Atlantic security system is vital to the defence of Italy and**
the protection of its national interests. Only the Atlantic Alliance has the capabilities
to deter and defend the Euro-Atlantic territory from conventional military threats. Although this type of threat is not currently considered likely, it is not to be excluded.
The only strategy that can maximize the security framework and mitigate the risks is
that of active participation in NATO.

**70. In this context, Italy will have to be a net contributor to security, maximizing the**
operational capacity that it offers and focusing on making a high-quality professional
contribution with appropriate means and materials. In this way Italy’s participation in
the Alliance’s response reaction forces will be more efficient, within the framework of
the current review of NATO forces.

A more secure Euro-Mediterranean region

**71. The Euro-Mediterranean area is the main area of national intervention. The achie-**
vement of a high degree of stability and democratic development in the countries
that affect the Mediterranean is therefore a priority for our country. The Defence will
contribute to the development of government policies designed to ensure this objective by ensuring targeted military cooperation with all nations in the area, by striving
for better and deeper cooperation in order to build a broader context of security and
stability over time. If specific circumstances make it necessary, the Defence must be
prepared to take direct responsibility, in response to crisis situations and be prepared to
intervene for peace and stability in accordance with the decisions of the international
community. In some cases, Italy may also have to take on the responsibility of leading
these operations, especially in those areas where Italy’s direct knowledge of the situations is greater due to historical, social or cultural proximity.


-----

**72. As part of the European Union Common Security and Defence Policy and NATO**
activities related to the “Mediterranean Dialogue” the Defence will develop policies
that are more attentive to the size of the Euro-Mediterranean security capabilities. In
accordance with the Ministry of Foreign Affairs it will also offers as a reference actor
for initiatives to be undertaken and continuing those already in progress in central
Europe and the Balkans.

A more secure and stable global system

**73. As previously stated, Italy has a sizeable economy with global perspectives and**
interests; it has multiple interests in all the continents and is an important partner in the
“international system”. Being a member of this system is of fundamental importance
for Italy it necessary be an “active member”.

**74. Outside the regions of priority action, the contribution of the Defence to building**
a more stable and secure international system will be guaranteed by two concurrent
lines of action coordinated with the other ministries. The first is to develop all the
existing military consultation and cooperation skills, in order to increase them and
encourage the processes of interrelation with shared interest nations. The second is the
selection and use of capabilities for use in military intervention within a limited time
frame and with a limited purpose in order to contribute - with the other countries of the
world community - to the protection of international security.

International security and defence strategy and the necessary capabilities

**75. The objectives and priorities outlined below summarise the main elements needed**
to define the medium-term strategy for international security and the defence of Italy:
**Sharing the security and defence. The multidisciplinary nature and complexity of**
the challenges of today’s world, as well as the size of the challenges, which is too
much for a single nation to handle alone, require Italy to find the best conditions of


-----

security and defence as part of a shared multinational framework. This framework will
be developed both within the nation, through a strengthened global intergovernmental
approach to issues, and in the international arena, through military cooperation and
integration with the collective defence structures.
**Active participation in security and defence. The strategy of sharing security and**
defence requires the nation to be, within its means, an active net contributor. This
requires the nation to be involved both in the definition and implementation of capabilities (military and otherwise) for the prevention, deterrence and elimination of
potential threats to stability and security, as well as in the international effort to ensure
the best conditions for peace and development.
**Multiple fields of action.** The creation of a solid and lasting framework of international security and defence requires a diversified multidisciplinary approach, with
different degrees of effort depending on the severity of the national interests at risk and
the use of all the tools at the State’s tools disposal, including the military.

**76. In accordance with this objective, the Defence will aim to create an integrated and**
modern military component, able to acquire, develop and sustain over time the skills
best suited for:

**- understanding the causes of modern conflict and the needs arising from the evolu-**
tion of the international situation;

**- preventing the emergence and consolidation of situations of risk or threats to the**
country;

**- intervene quickly, precisely and effectively to handle crisis situations and to elimi-**
nate any threats to the security and interests of the country.
The three main aspects of the military component to consider are: quantity, quality and
capability.

**77. The quantitative aspect of the military component will remain substantially un-**
changed with respect to the levels required by current legislation. The Ministry of
Defence has already started reducing personnel, with Law No. 244, 2012, going from
190,000 military and 30,000 civilians to 150,000 military and 20,000 civilians. The
Ministry of Defence, however, aims to create a younger, more streamlined and flexi

-----

ble personnel structure, with more modern recruitment criteria and career progression
and supported by legislation closer to the needs of a professional model of defence.
Moreover, to mitigate the possible risks associated with a reduced force structure, it
will study the creation of a reserve force that is able to contribute to the overall needs
of national security and defence.

**78. Quality will be given priority, in particular with regards to training and instruction,**
with specific attention paid to the forces with the highest level of operational readiness.
A better balance between quality and cost will be created to ensure that quantitative
requirements are not excessively penalised.

**79.** Capability will be enhanced by a better balance of quantity and quality and a
new governance structure that will lead to more effective political management of the
important choices. It will allow the armed forces to work together as single synergistic
unit. The goal is to achieve a more streamlined and efficient overall structure, with
fewer management levels, to make it less expensive and to give priority to operational
effectiveness.

Tasks and missions of the armed forces

**80. The tasks assigned to the armed forces are written in our constitution, which states**
that the defence of the homeland is the sacred duty of every citizen (Art. 52). These tasks
are explained and updated in article 89 of Legislative Decree no. 66, 2010 (“Military
Code - COM”). This decree states that the defence of the state is priority, as is the task of
working towards the realisation of peace and security, in accordance with international
law and the decisions of the international organizations of which Italy is a member (article
11 of the Constitution). The armed forces are also involved in safeguarding institutions
and have specific tasks in the event of a public calamity, as well as in other extraordinary
situations of great urgency. Finally, under Article 92 of the Military Code, the Armed
Forces, in addition to their institutional responsibilities, contribute on request, to situations which are in the interests of the general public and to environmental protection.


-----

**81. In keeping with the overall tasks dictated by law, this White Paper identifies speci-**
fic missions for the Armed Forces. These are guidelines for the subsequent review of
the military component and for military development and planning in general. They are:

**FIRST MISSION:** _Defence of the State. Consists of defending the State against all_
types of aggression in order to safeguard:
national territory;
the vital interests of the Nation;
the security of areas of national sovereignty and of Italian citizens abroad;
the security of lines of access to the nation.

**SECOND MISSION:** _Defence of the Euro-Atlantic and Euro-Mediterranean area. It_
consists of contributing to NATO’s collective defence and to maintaining stability in
areas on the Mediterranean Sea, in order to protect the vital and strategic interests of
the Nation.

**THIRD MISSION: Contributing to the development of peace and international se-**
_curity. In the context of international crisis management, consists of participating in_
operations to prevent and manage crises outside priority intervention areas, in order to
ensure peace, security, stability and international law, as well as fundamental human
rights according to the UN Charter.

**FOURTH MISSION:** _Specific tasks and joint operations. It consists of contributing_
to the protection of the institutions and of carrying out specific tasks in the event of
public calamities and other cases of extraordinary need and urgency.

Lessons learned from operations

**82. The analysis of general trends and operations conducted over the last twenty ye-**
ars has validated many principles and guidelines for the development of the armed
forces, already established in technical publications such as the Long-term Planning
Document and the Strategic Concept of the Defence Staff in 2005. In general terms,
the positive results achieved by the military in operations over the last twenty years,
demonstrate both the validity of the transformation process undertaken in the past by
the military component and the need to build and rapidly optimize the military, in line
with the economic reality of the country and with the changes, which are taking place
or are foreseeable in security scenarios in the interest of the nation. In particular:
**a. Conflict prevention and post-conflict stabilization and reconstruction, such as the**
operations in Bosnia and the Lebanon, have been successful not only thanks to the
quality of the work done by the armed forces and their military professionalism, but


-----

also thanks to the ability of the military component to pool resources and perform joint
force and joint ministry operations.
**b. The contribution of the armed forces to the management and resolution of interna-**
tional crises and conflicts, such as the operations in Kosovo, was decisive and strengthened the image and position of the nation the international arena.
**c. Military operations conducted to protect defenceless populations and to establish fun-**
damental human rights, such as those under way in Iraq, have demonstrated the ability of
the military to conduct specific tasks within limited time-frame, efficiently and effectively.
**d.** In the fight against international terrorism, the Defence has made an important
contribution not only working outside national territory, but also supporting the action
of the police force within the nation both with specialist contributions and by overseeing important metropolitan areas. In their contribution to humanitarian and rescue
operations in the case of catastrophic events, the armed forces have demonstrated a
versatile capability, fast action and intervention capability even in the critical early
stages, allowing the nation to prove its willingness and ability to act globally.

**83.** The need to put in place rapid and unplanned conventional operations in the
Balkans to implement the UN resolutions regarding Kosovo, or more recently, the
need to reassure Allies in Eastern Europe by demonstrating the ability to act jointly
and quickly, have confirmed the need to maintain a capability able to provide a conventional response and deterrence.

**84. The transformation of the military in order to improve its capability to send and**
support forces outside national territory has proved to be a valid concept, and it has
been the key to achieving significant operational success. The ability to provide this
capability quickly has been successful not only in managing typical military operations, but also in support operations in the event of severe natural disasters, such as the
earthquakes in Pakistan and Haiti.

**85. Joint operations have become standard procedure. The progressive development of**
the national capability to integrate ground, sea, air and space activities, as well as logistics and communications, has produced more effective and efficient operational results.


-----

**86. The progressive network-centred integration of command and control sensors**
and weapon systems has “multiplied the forces” which can increase the overall operational effectiveness of the capabilities and raise the level of knowledge and skill in
developing operational situations.

**87.** The Special Forces have shown their growing operational value, taking part in
multiple, complex operations in support of conventional forces or high profile operations in a broad spectrum of situations that include, but are not limited to, the release
of hostages, anti-terrorism and uprisings.

**88. The operational activities of the last two decades have increased the importance of**
some operational capabilities, particularly deployment logistics, in the C4ISTAR sector and in precision engagement, which have become increasingly useful in ensuring
that intervention is carried out effectively.

**89. The constant, careful and pragmatic use of Military Diplomacy has consolidated or**
created new and lasting relationships with many nations, thus facilitating the process
of international stabilization and the development of profitable, economic, cultural and
social relations.

**90. The ability to operate successfully in an integrated international system has been**
essential, but at the same time complex and difficult. In particular, it was critical to
develop better staff training, communication, “strategic enabling” and operational coordination skills, as well as being able to arrange and organise the forces.

**91. A global approach to crisis management and to achieving objectives has required**
more active non-military participation. This has highlighted the increasing need for
better coordination and integration at the “national system” level. In this context, the
armed forces have shown that they are able to provide the human and organizational
capability to develop this integration, thus increasing the credibility of the “national
system” in the international arena.


-----

**92. The identification of lessons learned and the preparation of suitable doctrinal and**
operational responses, as well as the subsequent adaptation of means and systems, has
not been as rapid, effective and precise as expected. Improvement of these activities is
essential to make operations even more successful.

Constants and changes in the characteristics of conflicts

**93. The experience gained from operations over the last two decades and academic**
research has highlighted a substantial
change in the type and characteristics of
both asymmetric and conventional conflicts.
In the case of asymmetric conflict, access
to modern technology to strategic communication techniques and to extensive
financial resources has allowed terrorist
organisations to expand their methods
and the scope of possible actions and damage.
In the case of conventional conflict, changes in the modes and tools being used are
emerging, with particular regard to the extension of operations into the domain of
cybernetics and into space. Less time elapses between making a decision and acting
on it. This aims to change the actual situation on the ground making it more dynamic
by alternating diplomacy and rapid military operations carried out by perfectly integrated limited forces.

**94. The results of the studies conducted in cooperation with friendly countries and**
allies, all highlight that in the future risks and threats will develop in extended and
fragmented areas, often characterized by situations of institutional anarchy. Subsequent operations will be characterized by a variety of operational difficulties due to
the need to ensure:
**a. access to the areas of operations and freedom of movement inside them. This requi-**


-----

res the ability to acquire and retain control of the territory and guarantee the freedom
of maritime navigation, the full availability of airspace and the ability to access and
use space and the cybernetic domain;
**b. suitable support of the population through involvement, legality and transparency**
according to needs arising from the effectiveness and safety of the operations;
**c. the ability to operate in congested areas, such as urban areas, coastal waters and**
lower airspace.
**d. the security of tangible and intangible communication lines which will be increasin-**
gly vulnerable in the future, especially the latter.
**e. the identification and understanding of all the actors involved in the area of ope-**
rations, discriminating between enemies and passive population, between friendly
military forces and civilian organizations.

**95. There is a high risk that in the future, even in conventional conflicts, enemy forces**
will use unconventional or asymmetric forms of fighting more frequently (hybrid threats). The exploitation of our vulnerability, unpredictable actions which may be carried
out in non-operational areas, the direct involvement - often passive, but sometimes
active - of civilian populations are all forms of conflict in which maximum security
for our forces and our territories must be guaranteed whilst, at the same time, ensuring
consolidation of local realities for which we are providing support.

**96. Therefore our armed forces will be asked to work towards increasingly complex**
and sophisticated goals, and the defeat or the deterrence of possible enemies will only
be part of the tasks required. Adopting a global intergovernmental approach to security
and defence issues, the armed forces will act to protect and safeguard populations, to
develop and support the authorities and local security forces and increase security and
stability levels, working closely both with diplomatic personnel and other ministries
personnel as well as from international governmental and non-governmental organizations.

**97. Although the possibility of a traditional military threat on the national territory**
appears to have decreased in the short term, a balanced and integrated deterrent force,


-----

consisting of conventional land, sea and aerospace capabilities, will ensure the defence of the nation in the future and contribute to the joint defence of NATO territories, in
accordance with on-going agreements.

**98. The support of Italian citizens for the armed forces and the awareness of interna-**
tional commitments will be increasingly decisive for the success of the delicate tasks
that Italy will be required to carry out in the future. Much has already been done with
regards to this issue, and there is a growing awareness in the nation of the role of the
armed forces and the professionalism of the Italian soldiers. However, it is still necessary to improve communication with the general public by sharing the aims, the scope
and the actions of the armed forces, thus ensuring transparency and control.

Implications for the armed forces

**99. Some of the lessons learned and observed trends are definitely of value and should**
be used as a starting point for improvement. The armed forces must take the following
concepts into consideration, regardless of whether or not they are able to perform their
assigned duties.

**100. The need to respond more quickly to changing needs means that activities have**
to be adapted in order to identify and purchase new equipment, to define how capabilities will be used, and to develop doctrine and operating procedures. The process
of transformation and adaptation of the armed forces requires more effort in order to
speed up analytical and procedural changes, as well as changes in attitude and predisposition, at all levels and in all sectors.

**101. Actions to prevent crisis and conflict must be anchored to a better information**
collection and analysis capability, to the study of phenomena and to knowledge of the
situations in which the armed forces will have to play an active role along with the
other organisms of the State. In situations of crisis or conflict, the action of the military
component will be effective only if it has superior command and control, surveillance,


-----

reconnaissance and information analysis capabilities, as well as an excellent understanding of the situation, which will therefore be strengthened.

**102. Integration and interoperability with the Allied Forces are the main factors which**
will ensure a significant and effective national contribution. In times of peace to achieve this objective, forces should be organised, prepared, educated and trained to operate
in multinational environments and as part of a larger deployment.

**103.** The extension of the domains of action into the cybernetic domain and space
means that specific defensive operational capabilities must be dedicated to these areas,
in order to preserve the safety of the “national system” and increase the solidity of the
political, economic and social structures.

**104. The rapid and intense development of technology requires the military compo-**
nent to promote the knowledge of the possibilities and effects of the availability of new
military and dual equipment and invest accordingly. Innovative concepts, such as “soft
air defence”, will require intense inter-ministerial cooperation for the management of
large quantities of data and the preparation of the capabilities necessary to manage it.

**105. The human element will remain central to the action of the military component,**
and it is essential to maintain this high level of professionalism over time. The ability to
interact in multicultural and complex environments, the ability to understand situations
as well as a spirit of invention and adaptability to different environments, will be the
main human characteristics in which to invest. The ability to use to modern equipment
to its full potential and the ability to train and motivate soldiers, as well as the staff of
friendly nations and allies, are the main objectives of the training and education process.

**106. Equipment for the armed forces will have to be cost-effective and consistent in**
terms of quality and technological level. The main objective is to achieve the “expressible capability”, this should be achieved as the result of several balanced factors, and
not only by purchasing systems of excellence, which are not adequately supported by
the other factors within the capability, and by the structure of the force that uses them.


-----

**107. The balance of the capabilities in the various domains of action will guarantee**
flexibility and efficient employment. The idea of having a comprehensive capability in
every sector, however, will have to be rethought in favour of the strengthening those
areas where deployment is more likely and effective. Enhancing capabilities will also
lead to excellence while necessary operational capabilities, and not only at national
level, will be pursued through international cooperation.

**108. The expressed capability of the “special forces” and “special operation forces”**
will be reinforced and further integrated in order to work synergistically with conventional forces. The support systems for these forces must be strengthened in terms of
efficiency, effectiveness and size. The process of “institution building” and “stabilisation” by Defence must be robust, especially in regards to equipping and training the
security forces in the country where they operate.

**Preparation & readiness of the armed forces**

# 5

**109. The “posture” of the armed forces is the provision and deployment of forces and**
the level of preparation and readiness at which they are maintained. This is one of the
most important strategic management tools available to balance the capabilities that
are available to counter any presumed threat. Operational capabilities are essential to
performance, therefore, must be considered in a developmental context and not merely
as costs.

**110. As previously stated, the geopolitical scenario is characterized by a high level**
of strategic uncertainty and situation volatility. In the short-term financial perspective, and taking into account international instability, only a fully integrated capability
specific for the armed forces that is carefully planned, can provide the nation with the
assets it needs to respond appropriately to risks and threats. This will allow the armed
forces to play an active role in redefining the security conditions and stability in key
geographic areas of interest.


-----

**111. Adjustments in the level of preparation of the armed forces and, consequently,**
the parameters of usability, sustainability and projectability, may be obtained more
quickly than changes in the structure and unit composition. The preparation and the
readiness of the forces are, therefore, the most effective tools to respond rapidly to
changes in the current security environment.

What does Defence have to be ready for?

**112. In addition of its primary task i.e. to ensure adequate defence of the State and**
in a NATO context, collective defence, the defence forces will have to be ready to
contribute to the European Union to carry out a series of activities and operations that
include:

-  rapid operations aimed to protect vital national interests, either independently or as
part of a broader coalition;

-  peace operations and stabilization in response to international crises;

-  specialist support activities and a training, both nationally and abroad;

-  the safeguarding of free institutions in case of necessity or urgency;

-  humanitarian assistance and support in case of disasters, both nationally and abroad;

-  evacuation of overseas compatriots in case of emergency.

**113. Defence will continue to regularly check how best to adapt their levels of prepara-**
tion and readiness that will allow it to better manage the challenges and opportunities
presented by strategic changes in the regional area. This will also allow for efficient
political decision-making, resource allocation and outcome monitoring. The Defence
will implement a new management system focused on the levels of readiness and
preparation of the forces. The progressive reduction of the national effort in many
large operations that has characterized the past decade, and offers the opportunity to
find a new balance in the forces, allowing it to better support the security policies of
the Euro - Mediterranean region.


-----

Required levels of readiness and preparation

**114. Adequate levels of preparation and readiness of the forces ensure that they have**
the military capabilities to carry out any intervention if approved by the government.
These parameters are important indicators for assessing the actual output of operational potential of the military and the effectiveness of the investments made in it. Over
the last twenty years, the Italian Defence Force has made a substantial contribution to
international military action abroad. Functional to this objective, was the possibility of
using the forces in a variety of military missions and multinational operations, which
was possible thanks to adequate preparation levels and readiness.

**115. Planning the correct levels of readiness and operational preparation is a sophisti-**
cated and complex exercise. It requires the right balance between available resources
and the level of risk that the nation is willing to take. Keeping a large part of the forces
in a high state of readiness and preparation reduces the level of strategic risk for the
nation. However, it also involves high costs and pressure on military staff, resources,
systems and operational infrastructure. In contrast, low levels of readiness and preparedness are unacceptable, because it will result in the inability of the military forces to
perform the tasks and missions it is assigned, while putting military personnel at high
risk, therefore, a pointless exercise.

**116. As part of NATO, Italy helped develop three benchmarks by which it is possi-**
ble to objectively evaluate the level of
“employability” of the armed forces
and their performance to operate in
today’s scenarios and the foreseeable
future. They consist of:
_the_ _usability of forces, or the percenta-_
ge of forces readily employable in the
terms of required certificates and professional qualifications, availability of
systems, and training levels;


-----

_deployment of the forces, or the percentages of forces able to be used effectively off_
station and the capabilities necessary for mobility and logistical support;
_sustainability of the forces, or the percentage of forces able to be used for long opera-_
ting cycles off station, prepared therefore with technical resources, logistical support
and the need for unit rotation time.

**117. The values for these benchmarks, collectively identified by NATO countries, are**
an essential minimum target for the military forces, which need to be achieved and
maintained over time. The allocation of adequate resources to achieve these results
is, therefore, a key priority. Compatibly, the financial framework that is now available
has seen a reversal in the trend of spending in the area of maintenance operations, in
adherence to what was agreed by NATO.

**118.** When identifying and implementing the correct levels of force readiness and
preparation for the medium and long term, it should be pointed out that there is time
delay between immediate intervention and an optimal military response. Defence is
well aware that this involves handling new and unpredictable circumstances with existing assets. To mitigate these risks, strategy identified plans, act along three lines:

-  to provide an adequate flow of information and an effective capability for analysis
and strategic assessment, to better appreciate the evolution of the situation and needs
to facilitate any preparation for what is necessary;

-  identify, preserve and enhance the traditional operational capabilities, the level of capability reached and quality of adopted systems, in the areas of excellence that concerns
the “National System.” These capabilities form the backbone of the national contribution to any international coalition of operations outside the priority areas of intervention,
but also the priority areas aimed towards the gradual process of European integration;

-  when managing less likely high intensity operational scenarios, focus is put on maintaining a significant deterrent capability that is constituted by an integrated modern,
combat force, perfectly integrated with multinational forces, and for a limited period.
In the same spirit, Defence looks to maintain, wherever possible, a sufficiently broad
base of embryonic operational capabilities, which are operationally employable, and
can eventually be expanded to address changing scenarios.


-----

Military installations, live ranges and military property

**119. To carry out assigned tasks, the armed forces need military installations whe-**
re they can work and be accommodated in. This includes training areas, munition
deposits, storage of materials and areas devoted to the defence of the territory. The
national arrangement of the armed
forces is planned as a result of specific military requirements and with it
come economic advantages. Although
sometimes these installations can result
in different levels of costs there are benefits for the local population. Despite
this, military installations are unavoidable and essential in guaranteeing the
safety of all citizens.

**120.** The State’s military property includes installations that are engaged in
national defence. These installations
include ports, airports, fortifications,
barracks, administrative and logistic
facilities of various types and deposits.
State property provides a logistical element critical to the proper functioning
of the armed forces, which must be effective and beneficial when in use. For these
reasons, the Defence has started a process of assessing the actual needs of those
areas that are no longer considered necessary, returning them to the community
for their full use. In addition to this activity, the Defence will start a census of the
limitations, established by Legislative Decree n.66 / 2010, which are subject to areas
adjacent to military property and examine every possibility to keep restrictions to a
minimum.


-----

**121. The integration process of logistic and territorial bodies, together with the reor-**
ganization of forces and high commands, will reduce the needs of state property and
embark on the modernization of the remaining infrastructure. This concept includes
relatively few large multifunctional infrastructures. This process will make it more
convenient and synergistic, for economies of scale, with the establishment and use of
staff support services and general operations of the forces.

**122. Of particular importance is the need to develop a new and modern housing policy**
to ensure the availability of onsite service staff in a high mobility context that is inherent to military life. The current demand for housing is much greater than availability
and is geographically unbalanced due to the changed operating conditions linked to the
reorganization of the defence forces. The difficulty in finding the necessary financial
resources for housing, require that the issue be addressed by a number of innovative
solutions.

**123.** The land, sea and air training areas, are an essential element to maintain the
operational effectiveness of the armed forces. Italy is a densely populated country,
with complex terrain and has an extensive tourist industry, therefore, there needs to be
a sensitive approach when using public areas for military training activities. Defence
recognizes this need and over the past twenty years has worked to reduce the impact of
its activities in terms of time dedicated to exercises. As a result, Italy today, is among
the first European countries, which has the lowest percentage of its territory set aside
for military exercises. However, Defence efforts to minimize this impact are incomplete, and provide temporary use of alternate areas for the military and civilians, with
particular attention to areas of natural beauty and landscape. Bearing in mind these
objectives, there is a need to use training areas outside the national territory. In the
light of these experiences, the use of these external areas is a major factor when fully
preparing, effective and realistic units.

**124. Notwithstanding the need to maintain a minimum but adequate number of trai-**
ning areas for real assets in the coming years, the Defence will strive to increase the
portion of its activities carried out in simulated mode or through the use of information


-----

systems and simulators. Priority will be given to minimize the environmental impact
of activities and to make the training areas risk free to the public and technologically
developed for dual use, i.e. for purposes related to civil protection and security. Finally, the use of these areas will promote the economic development and growth of
industrial communities.

Reserve Forces

**125.** Reserve Forces are an integral
part of a professional military organisation and the Atlantic Alliance requires
smaller armed forces to be maintained
at lower costs. Typically, the Reserve
Forces provide operational capabilities
with less expertise which require more
time to be reactivated or specialised capabilities from civilian professions not
included in the armed forces, as well as
capabilities which require training that is not cost effective for the armed forces.

**126. The uncertainty of international situations and the possibility that some opera-**
tional situations might not be adequately addressed in the future, require different
forms of capability integration by the military. The goal is to create an “operational
reserve” readily usable and effective, that is a force composed of trained officers,
non-commissioned officers and troops to be used for military purposes and as a civil
emergency response force.

**127. In terms of operational capabilities, the reserve force component should include**
the following:

-  Specialist Capability that are not normally part of the permanent forces or are insufficient. For example, professional medical or nursing personnel, engineering or


-----

communications experts and contract workers. These forces may be required from the
outset of crisis and therefore should be readily available.

-  Complementary Capability is generally used in lower risk scenarios and conflicts and
does not require the entire range of operational capabilities and training. They allow
for an increase in the number of available forces that remain in a high state of readiness for the most demanding tasks. This also avoids the situation where they might be
used in less demanding roles.

-  Additional Capability, which aims to support and strengthen the regular forces and normally require more preparation time, so their role during long term operations is preferable.

-  Mobility Capability, where the reserve forces offer a basis for expanding the regular
force in case of mobilization when dealing with emergencies.

**128. In terms of organisational solutions, Defence will present operational proposals for**
the creation of a new voluntary reserve force structure that:

-  is consistent with the new conceptual framework of enlistment and career progression;

-  takes advantage of training activities but also organisational ones, support structures and existing armed associations, especially in relation to the fact that the reserve
forces could be recruited into state institutions in the event of extraordinary events ;

-  is regional or macro-regional, to minimize costs and link the reserve force structure
to the region that it is based in;
-be financed in the context of specific regulatory measures decreed by government when
necessary to implement specific national needs, such as situations of crisis or emergency;
-provides for different forms of reserve force, such as the youngest and operational,
to be used on frequent cycles, or for part-time and specially trained personnel which
would be used in less frequent cycles;

-  is open to civilians with the suitable skills and degrees.

**129. The key to success for the establishment of an effective Reserve is to fully in-**
tegrate it into the capability structure of the armed forces and to use it in regularly
in tasks and training cycles. All of this in a system which is able to routinely use,
according to requirements, Regular Forces and Reservists to cover a broader spectrum
of national security and defence needs.

**The transformation of the armed forces**

# 6

Future operational model of the armed forces and development of capabilities

**130. The challenge that the nation has to face and solve, concerns the creation of a**
military force that is able to meet the needs of international security and defence. In
the short term, this means mitigating any risks that could result from limited resources,
and in the medium and long term, developing a synergistic capability to prevent and
manage situations of instability and international uncertainty.

**131.** Obtaining the correct balance between quantity, quality and capability is the
main task of Defence in the immediate future, and will be implemented through the
publication of the “strategic review of defence”, which will end with the definition
of a new fifteen year plan. It seems clear that this task will not be a mere exercise in


-----

analysis and technical assessment, but rather a work of ongoing political orientation
and supervision. The points stated below show the general concepts and principles
that will underpin the revision of the operational structure of the armed forces, so
that they can continue to serve and guarantee the defence of the State and of free
institutions.

General concepts and principles for the review of the force structure

**132. In order to ensure the fulfilment of tasks, there is a need to define the set of policy**
tools that the nation is able and willing to achieve and maintain effective. This means
providing the necessary level of resources, but also being able to organise them according to key priorities. These two factors are both essential and strongly interconnected.
The development strategy of military capabilities would be incomplete in the absence
of a clear definition of priorities to be activated.

**133. The complexity of the global system in which we live, requires the adoption of**
multiple instruments that can operate at any moment and in different contexts. For
some of these, the Ministry of Defence assists and supports the government:

-  the current intelligence system so that it can effectively collect, analyse and report
information, anticipate any national threats, work to reduce the risk of uncertainty, and
provide better risk management;

-  effective and persuasive diplomacy, that has the authority to encourage the development of cooperation, thus reducing the potential of conflict. Effective diplomacy
can contribute to crisis management and facilitate the return to social and political
stability after conflicts;

-  effective instruments able to properly orientate national and international companies,
that result in more favourable investment conditions and allow for the strengthening
of political relations;

-  strategic communication tools to create and share knowledge with the target audience and designed for institutional purposes to protect national interests.


-----

**134. It is the direct responsibility of Defence and fundamental to the framework of**
national security, to ensure a military that has a complete range of capabilities which
can be activated by the nation to protect its interests, and can operate effectively at
all stages of crises and conflicts. The military must therefore be sufficient to allow a
proper balance between the various operational components, flexible enough to meet
changing needs over time, and able to deploy at short notice.

**135.** Such flexibility and expansion, do not however, need the availability of the
entire range of capabilities, but rather a combination of what it is possible to generate and sustain, focusing on areas of consolidated experience, above all on areas
of investment and areas in which the real prospects of greater operational focus will
allow development in areas of excellence. In fact, the real guarantee of the Nation’s
defence lies in participation in a system of collective defence, where a significant and
effective contribution to the whole force, resides not so much in the generation of a
large residual capability, but rather in ensuring a significant contribution in advanced
capabilities. This necessitates the need to develop a complex force that is truly integrated in terms of military assets that can be used in different theatres and provide a
real increase in the operational effectiveness. As a consequence, there is a need for
conceptually unified instruments of action which are fully operational and sustainable
over time, based on a careful balance between theoretical requirements, acquired systems and the areas of capability in which to invest resources.

**136. Therefore, the current general planning system will be transformed into a system**
based on “expressed capability”. When preparing for the future, the system will place
emphasis not so much on the centrality of specific weapons systems or levels of forces
necessary to counter a defined threat, but rather on the tasks that the armed forces will
have to perform and the skills that they will require to be able to carry out their tasks.
This will mean accepting a number of operating risks, which include the less likely,
but more dangerous threat to national security. These risks must be clearly defined for
the political and institutional authorities and exposed to public opinion.


-----

**137. The second factor to be considered in the conceptual development and the subse-**
quent general planning of the armed forces, relates to the probability and way in which
the military component is used, based on the proper distribution of available resources
to obtain the desired results. In principle, planning and preparation of the military based on the potential expressible operating capabilities will allow politicians
wider discretion when electing to use
the military. This will depend on the
situation, which is conditioned only by
structural and dimensional limits of an
unavoidable nature. In the presence of
limited resources, however, the definition of an area of geopolitical interest
will allow for the optimization in the
number and quality of available assets that offer more options in certain areas rather
than others. In this context, and in addition to homeland defence, the government
believes that the Mediterranean region remains a priority area when protecting national interests. This will allow the military to verify threats and then project its power
quickly and clearly abroad and throughout the Nation.

**138. To operate in this geostrategic situation, the military must be calibrated so as to**
offer the best capability during intervention and to ensure that Italy is also capable of
leading any multinational operations which may include crisis management, restoring
peace and international security. This means the availability of adequate resources
for the military command of multinational forces, operating in a coalition, as well
as a significant intervention capability in the entire theatre of operations, in order to
contribute significantly to the success of the operations.

**139. Outside of this priority area, Italy will be able to generate its military intervention**
capabilities, limited in time and purpose to compete with other countries in the international community; to preserve peace and international stability. In such cases, the
armed forces will be required to prepare packages of capabilities with a high level of


-----

specialization that can be fully integrated with multinational forces. This also means
ensuring a suitable command and control system.

**140. The choice of capabilities to be used for intervention in support of operations**
outside priority areas of action will be made in a context of increasing cooperation
amongst EU nations on the topic of defence. Italy will have to help strengthen this
cooperation, when the process of integration makes it possible, in order to ensure that
the national military capability is specialised and efficient enough, thanks to experience gained from numerous international missions, to be deployed in the context of the
Common Policy on Security and Defence.

The Review of governance

**141. The transformation of Defence into a system that combines operational effecti-**
veness and process efficiency and in the light of economic restraints requires suitable
operating procedures to be successful. An in-depth survey has shown that over the last
twenty years, the quantitative reduction and creation of a professional military, has not
always been accompanied by modernization and adequate administration inside the
organisation.

**142. With regards to the political management of Defence, the incomplete implemen-**
tation of the principles underpinning Act No. 25 of 1997 has not made it possible to
fully complete the effective policy tools available to the political authority for the
management of the department. At the same time, the actions of government bodies
request an adjustment of direct support to the political authority as part of a process aimed at increasing the efficiency of public administration and reducing costs. Therefore, a thorough and essential review of the conceptual structure to support the political
management of the ministry for better economic management, more effective action
and full compliance with the Act, is necessary.


-----

**143.** The technical-operational and technical-administrative areas, and the existing
organizational structures have been subject to revision in recent years to adapt to the
new requirements. However, they are still characterized by an excessive number of
hierarchical levels, due to a high fragmentation of skills and unnecessary duplication.
This situation is the result of the solutions adopted in the past to manage a larger armed
force, whose units were scattered throughout the nation and consisted primarily of
enlisted personnel. The identified needs, the professional requirements of a reduced
armed force and the need to contain costs now require a different model of governance, a model which is lighter, more linear, and resilient, characterized by lower levels
of hierarchical and organizational complexity.

**144. Awareness of the fact that in the future the military component will be increasin-**
gly integrated with those of other European countries and NATO, leads to the pursuit
of more multinational integration. This includes functions like command and control,
training and logistical support and mainly those less critical than protecting national
sovereignty.

General concepts & principles

**145. The review of Defence governance is a priority for the government in terms of**
policies related to international security and defence. In the short term, it is necessary
to manage the risks that arise from the erosion of the armed force capability, which
affects national security, and to act in order to maximize results with what is available.
Also, it is essential to ensure that resources which have been allocated to Defence, however limited, are used in the most effective and efficient way, after the reorganization
of the military.

**146. Defence, therefore, will act in accordance to two guidelines:**

-  the first is aimed at restoring the minimum level of resources needed to ensure that
the operation of the military component is solid and better managed, in line with economic trends related to the situation and European standards. This makes it easier


-----

to renew the operational model and improves the transparency and effectiveness of
choices. It also centralizes the role of the government and parliament when making
decisions related to defence, optimizing the use of available resources and finally,
facilitating the efficiency of policy towards the national defence industry.

-  the second guideline is aimed at the revision of governance, with the goal of reducing
the level of human and financial resources necessary for management and support,
whilst maintaining the same operational capabilities. In this context, the organization
and function of Defence will be reviewed to allow for more effective management
policies. This includes an action plan designed to synergise all of the different components of the military, completing the reform initiated in 1997 by Defence Minister
Andreatta. The objective is to ensure that strategic choices are made in unison, controlling management costs, and strengthening effective action at every level.

**147. The first guiding principle of this review relates to the organization of strategic**
functions. Those that have been identified are: “political management”, “strategic
_and military management”, “generation and preparation of forces”, the ‘”use of for-_
_ce” and “support to forces.” Central and local institutions, as well as command units,_
will be reorganized by eliminating any unnecessary duplication i.e. by combining
units that perform the same roles, while avoiding fragmentation of resources and eliminating economic inefficiencies.

**148. The second guiding principle is “unified command”, in conjunction with “centra-**
lized management but decentralized execution.” The goal is to achieve more effective
political, military and strategic-military Defence management and unified planning,
management, acquisition, use of capabilities and integrated support. Organizational
choices and improved working methods will also help to identify inefficiency and
resolve issues at the lowest possible level in each operating environment. At the apex
of this reorganisation there will be institutionalized “decision-making committees” to
ensure, (in accordance with roles and hierarchies), the widest range of choices, and
the identification of various issues creating an effective link between policy guidelines
and technical requirements.


-----

**149.** The third guiding principle relates to the efficiency and economic viability of
operations, which are the main reasons for government reform. There is a need to
develop and measure the quality of the operation processes with precise criteria, in
particular those areas that oversee the management of allocated resources over time.
This will make it possible to inform parliament and the public about the choices and
actions of the government and Defence, allowing for more transparency that is essential in creating awareness and broader involvement.

**150. These guidelines will therefore strengthen the operational instruments and me-**
thods of action in order to make the processes of choice more transparent while at the
same time identifying solutions to problems. This also involves setting up effective
internal evaluation instruments that regard the process of reaching objectives. In addition, new systems will be introduced to strengthen planning procedures, management
and reporting of resources, and services provided in order to correctly correlate them
to the tasks assigned to the armed forces.

Political management

**151. “Political management” is the**
first identified function that will be
subject to change and strengthening. The powers of the Minister
of Defence are defined by law. The
Military Code, art. 10, paragraph 1,
states that the Minister of Defence,
who is in charge of military administration, civil defence and heads
the highest hierarchical and disciplinary body:

-  implements the resolutions related to defence and security adopted by the government,
that are submitted to the Supreme Defence Council and approved by Parliament;


-----

-  issues directives on military policy, for information activities, security and technical
and administrative activities;

-  participates directly or through a delegate in all international and European organizations in the field of defence and security or whose decisions directly impact national
defence;

-  approves overall planning and joint-operation programs, at a technical and financial
level, as well as planning for public and private industry, that is of interest to Defence.

**152. In addition to implementing government decisions and approving planning acti-**
vities, the Minister of Defence, has a range of responsibilities that are precisely defined. These constitute the “function of political orientation”. They include (but are not
limited to) military policy, development policy, employment policies for personnel,
industrial policies and international relations.

**153.** The existing instruments for direct cooperation with the political authority, as
well as those that oversee management and control, have not yet met the new requirements. Firstly, it is essential to overcome the difference of information that inevitably
penalizes political institutions when compared to the permanent joint administration
activities. Secondly, in order to strengthen political management and control, the Defence Minister must have full autonomy, with an adequate means of action, for both
political and administrative functions, and be able to assess administration and management activities.

**154. Therefore, the offices that directly cooperate with the Ministry will be strengthe-**
ned in areas that are connected to high level politics, giving them tasks and functions
normally delegated to other branches of administration. In contrast, administrative
bodies or structures supporting these activities, which are not strictly associated with
political management and control will be rationalized. This reorganization will lead to
a reduction in staff of these offices.

**155. In order to protect department autonomy in the execution of its functions, the**
Minister and Under Secretaries of Defence will be guaranteed in their right to choose


-----

the staff for these offices, according to the general rules that regard the organization of
employment by the public authorities. It will therefore be possible to draw on specific
skills outside of the Ministry of Defence, according to strict professional requirements
and experience. Maximum autonomy and the best working conditions for military
and civilian personnel must be guaranteed, even by adopting specific institutions and
changing existing regulations for personnel who are temporarily employed in a role
outside of Administration.

The Defence administration

**156. The Defence administration differs in many respects from that of other ministries**
due to the task of defending the country. Within the Defence structure, in fact, there is
a need to find an appropriate balance between the routine functions of public administration, and the need to prepare, support and employ commands and military units in
Italy and abroad. The current organization is the result of progressive and significant
adaptation due to the continuous downsizing of the military. In just thirty years, personnel have been halved including the number of operational Army Brigades and the
number of squadrons in the Air Force.

**157. The fundamental Defence reform initiated by former Defence Minister Andreatta**
and incorporated in the provisions of Law No. 25 of 1997, outlined the evolution of
the joint force structure towards a more streamlined and efficient integrated solution,
anticipating the changes that were subsequently made by many European countries.
While acknowledging that much has already been done, there are still many areas
where reform is necessary to overcome the traditional organizational constraints of
the armed force.

**158.** Moving quickly and effectively towards a new integrated military is the best
solution to ensure savings in the areas of human resources, infrastructure and finance
that are now necessary to operate effectively. Therefore, the elimination of all organizational duplication that is not strictly necessary, the consolidation, reduction and


-----

simplification of hierarchical organizational levels, and reduction of any bureaucratic
superstructure to a minimum, are the qualitative elements that must inspire future
restructuring in the military.

**159. The main reference for the governance review and the consequent organisatio-**
nal structure will be function-based, and the review will be developed around those
functions previously identified. The management model also has to be made more
effective by the introduction in some sectors of modern working methods, similar to
those of private companies, especially in the field of acquisition, logistics and general
support. Finally regulations will be introduced to improve the transparency and stability of resource investment and for major maintenance programs and upgrades.

**160.** Acquiring specific assets and then not guaranteeing their “operational capability” through the appropriate training of staff and proper logistical support, puts the
investment at risk and clearly damages the nation. Since the stability of resources over
time is essential to ensure the correct planning for their use, this has led to legislation
(every six years), which is updated every three years for Defence investment, to provide stability and political supervision (government and parliament) of the most important choices. The duration of six years will allow alignment with the stability laws.

**161. The governance review must also include a reform related to recruitment methods,**
career progression and tasks of the military and civilian management, and finally, it
must ensure that military leaders are younger and better prepared. The new rules for
the appointment and removal of the top military leaders, ensures an adequate mechanism for continuing the activities of planning, programming and use of the armed forces.

**162. At the same time there will be improved involvement and institutional commu-**
nication between parliament and citizens. The current form of information, resulting
from progressive layering of laws and regulations, will be simplified and made clearer,
allowing for a unified vision and perspective, eliminating unnecessary duplication,
and producing documents that are better understood.


-----

Productivity of resources and expenditure control

**163. In order to ensure a new governance structure with appropriate governing me-**
chanisms, new administration tools and methods will be introduced to make activities
transparent, participatory and provide effective processes of choice. In parallel, tools
will be developed to ensure effective internal evaluation when achieving objectives.
In particular, the Defence will have to move towards the following priority areas of
action, which constitute new regulations that will be prepared as a result of this White
Paper.

**164. Outdated distribution of costs: for personnel, for operations and for investments,**
there is in fact, the need to adopt a
more modern and better allocation of
resources, in accordance with criteria
adopted by other European countries,
but above all, with the real role that
these costs play in the Defence budget.
At an initial level and on the understanding that major investment programs
will be included in a specific law, the
three points of reference should be:
_“personnel”, “operability of the mili-_
_tary component” (administration, training, rapid response, technology development)_
and “operations” (cooperation and military missions at a national and international
level).

**165.** _Modernization of procedures for planning, management and accountability of_
_resources and services provided is required in order to synchronize with available_
resources. This is also linked to the range of assigned tasks, established by political
objectives and destined to relevant military branches including the instruments needed
to attain them.


-----

**166. Development of a culture of effectiveness and efficiency, will be established not**
only in the operating area, but also in the use of resources and by all those responsible,
with particular reference to skills of technical planners, planning and control at all
levels, and ethical aspects. These capabilities, in fact, cannot be improvised or delegated, but require continuous updating, with verification and assimilation of the concept
“for the good of the State”.

**167. Development of accurate assessment tools will be devised to measure costs in**
_relation to results, while taking into account the systemic interdisciplinary nature of_
the Defence sector, with the primary task of reducing the level of bureaucratic processes that cannot be converted into simple formal procedures. Existing rules will change, along with procedures and methods of using resources, which will be simplified.
Objectives must be realistic, measurable and correlated to available resources.

Enlistment and personnel structures

**168.** It has emerged in studies relating to the law n. 244 of 2012 that the current
staffing structure is not totally adapted to the demands placed on the military, leading
to criticism about the ability to address the present and future challenges that relate to
international security and national defence. The military in fact:
**a. tend to be characterized by a high average age due to: a high percentage of staff**
in permanent service, and the need to standardize military personnel to the applicable
rules of civilian service, which are not always appropriate in a military context.
**b. have currently significant imbalances in the distribution of ranks and categories of**
_staff, due to a sharp decrease in the overall numbers of personnel in the military over_
the past twenty years. This, over time has not been effectively mitigated, for example,
forms of early retirement have departed from the normal dynamics of retirement for
personnel. The introduction of the professional model has also not followed a consistent revision in the terms of recruitment and career progression, which has further
exacerbated the imbalance mentioned. In this sense, the revision of the terms of recruitment, career progression and permanent service introduced with the professional


-----

model has highlighted problems associated with the use of staff in fixed positions. As
a result, the introduction of new reference models has led to an imbalance accounting
for higher ranked senior staff at the expense of lower ranked junior staff.
**c. suffer from excessive system rigidity, due to the rules governing recruitment, care-**
er progression and retirement, which are also influenced by underlying government
regulations. The final outcome is a decreased ability to adapt to changing needs, an
imbalance of staff resources with respect to operational functions and lower overall
operational effectiveness.
**d. do not have an effective professional “operational reserve”. The Atlantic Alliance,**
however, has repeatedly asked for the creation of a reserve force structure, able to
complement active regular forces in case of need.

General concepts and principles

**169. With regards to the recruitment of staff, new methods of recruitment and types of**
service will be introduced to achieve the objectives in terms of overall cost, effectiveness, operational efficiency and level of professionalism that the public administration
and especially Defence must reach. In particular, the new system is asked to:
**a.** _become a single integrated force, where the civilian and military personnel operate in a_
unified, synergistic and joint way, to achieve the objectives assigned to the Defence ministry.
**b. be more cost effective, whilst maintaining a strength of 150,000 units. In order to**
improve the level of expenditure in favour of operations and efficiency and whenever
possible improve remuneration in line with military specifications.
**c.** _be on average younger than at present, and facilitate the change of management._
When fully operational, the military will have to ensure the average age of staff in
various categories (officers, NCOs, and Troops) making sure it is in line with that of
other European armed forces and that this situation will remain unchanged over time to
avoid any cyclical re-occurrence of the ageing problem and in order to give the model
greater operational effectiveness and efficiency. The younger and “operational” part of
the force will be basically equal to about two-thirds of the entire military component.
**d.** _Be flexible and adaptable, in order to rapidly adjust the overall size of the armed_


-----

forces as needs change. This objective should be achieved through administrative
measures that may use maximum decisional powers over the next few years by correlating any increase of expense in personnel to situations that actually require them.
**e.** _To be strongly oriented towards education and training._ The relatively frequent
turnover of staff requires extensive training capabilities in order to quickly bring new
recruits to high levels of competency and technical knowledge. In addition, these
aspects will contribute to more effective action that regards international stabilization,
through better cooperation in the field of education and training.
**f.** _Pursue internationalisation of military capabilities, which should be integrated and_
potentially usable by allied countries and friends. This is aimed at facilitating the process of European unification and our armed forces.
**g.** _Represent added value for the nation, resulting from the benefits of training and_
education that is guaranteed by the professionalism of the Defence staff.
**h.** _Facilitating the integration of Defence with civilian society. Today, the armed for-_
ces are characterized by approximately 88% of staff in permanent service and only
12% of staff on temporary contracts. The target is to bring the Italian armed forces
to percentages similar to those of the armed forces of other European countries. This
means reaching, a fully operational, balance between permanent and temporary staff
basically equal to about 50%. This will be achieved by identifying mechanisms that
facilitate:

-  the temporary use of necessary personnel in permanent service in the areas of
public administration and/or the civilian working world, in order to put their
acquired professional knowledge at the service of the nation. However, at the
end of active service, general managers will not be able to work for companies
in the defence sector for a certain number of years in order to avoid any conflict
of interest;

-  the reintegration into the civilian working world at the end of service, for temporary staff, will also facilitate the transfer of skills and values gained during their
service to the state.
When fully operational, the armed forces will be kept young and motivated thanks
to a continuous cycle that is constantly representative of Italian society and fully
integrated with it.

Capitolo

**Organization, structure and capabilities**
**of the armed forces**

# 7

The new organizational structure of the armed forces

**170. The need of the armed forces to fulfil their duties effectively and efficiently in**
complex, multinational, and high risk situations requires the ability to work in unison towards a common goal. That is with complete unity of purpose in an integrated
manner and using the available resources in all domains of action. This approach must
involve stages of education, training, support, and development towards necessary
capabilities. This constitutes a stronger outlook for a joint military that shares a common culture which is key to the future of the armed forces. It is a point of reference in
organizational decisions, doctrine and task execution. However, the culture and professionalism of the armed force must be preserved, because only perfect knowledge
and immersion in the domains of action will create the required efficacy to deal with
complex scenarios in the future.

**171. The objective is to summarise and address these two seemingly conflicting re-**
quirements, through effective and efficient solutions that do require the establishment
of new structures. Therefore a review of management and command structures in the
armed forces is necessary. Following is a basic outline, pending a more thorough detailed check for compliance with the expected effectiveness and efficiency criteria.

The review and management of command structures

**172. As part of the function of “strategic and military management”, the Chief of De-**
fence Staff (CASMD) will remain the head of the military-technical office in Defence


-----

Administration. He will be solely responsible to the political authority for all aspects
related to recruitment, preparation, tasking, general support, and logistics of the armed
forces. The organization he is responsible for will ensure the execution of the basic
functions fundamental to the military.

**173. The first function is “the employment of forces.” The Chief of Defence Staff, as**
“Commander in Chief”, is responsible for the armed forces and for their use. There
will be a Vice Commander for Operations (OPS - VCOM), who will be delegated
the responsibility for operational planning and for tasking forces in theatre. He will
be the head of a Joint Operational Command, and of existing operational commands,
that will carry out component command functions while maintaining their specific
competence in their respective fields of employment and a functional link with the
staff responsible for force generation. They will work under the OPS - VCOM and
the Joint Special Operations Command who will make use of existing commands and
existing capabilities and the Cybernetic Operations Command. Any type of military
operation, therefore, comes under the responsibility of the Joint Command, including
cases where the single component is sufficient for their execution.

**174. The second function, referred to as “support to the forces”, is a logistical one.**
The National Armaments and Logistics Director (DNAL) will centralize the acquisition of weapon systems, infrastructures and logistics, with the exception of direct
support to operational units. This will result in an organization based on two major
conceptual pillars:
**a. The first will perform the functions now assigned to some departments and techni-**
cal management offices in the General Defence Secretariat. It will be responsible for
technical and administrative activities to ensure the acquisition of weapons systems
and the disposal of weapons at the end of their life cycle. To assure the compliance of
the activities with the needs of operational units, the head of this structure will make
use of key employment offices, which will maintain a working relationship with those
responsible for force generation.
**b. The second, structured as Logistic Command of Defence (CLD), will ensure the**
professional management of funds and the “logistics of consumption” that can be


-----

jointly managed in supply activities, efficient maintenance, transport, infrastructure,
health, police and technical services.

**175. In virtue of the strategic role based on economic and technological planning, both**
at an industrial and international level, policies regarding the area of: the aerospace
industry, defence and security, and the public and private interests of Defence, are
strictly the competence of the political head of the ministry. For the implementation of
political directives the DNAL depends directly on the Ministry of Defence.

**176. The third function regards the generation and preparation of forces. The Chiefs**
of Staff of the armed forces respond to the CASMD. They will, on the basis of the
directives received, take responsibility for the generation and preparation of the land,
air and naval forces. The Commanding General of the Carabinieri will continue to
depend on the Chief of the Defence Staff of the armed forces, while the structure
of the General Command will be simplified and some department functions will be
integrated into joint forces.

**177.** In order to exercise its functions, the CASMD will employ staff that will be
commanded by the Deputy Chief of the Defence Staff. The Ministry of Defence will
therefore have a strong new organization, while each General Staff organisation will
be made more streamlined, consistent with the duties to be performed. In general,
support departments that also provide certain complementary functions, and which are
now fragmented, will be reduced to what is essential at all levels. They will be centralized to a single command level on the basis of common competencies. Similarly, no
staff organisation will have command functions, or if they do, they will be transferred
to the appropriate executive bodies.

**178.** The technical-administrative functions, with the exception of those associated
with activities under CASMD, will be reordered within the General Defence Secretariat, whose management will be entrusted to a civilian Secretary General who ultimately responds to the Ministry of Defence.


-----

The development of unitary capabilities and joint force integration

**179. In order to achieve effective results, efficiency and better cost management, the**
reorganization of the armed forces will develop a new working model that is participatory, goal-oriented and fully integrated. Hence, the need to complete the regulations
and general guidelines based on decision-making and management at both the political
level, and at Defence Staff level. They should ensure rules and shared methods of building choices by decision-making and control bodies that can ensure the representation
of a number of perspectives and needs.

**180. Staff is an essential element for the success for this transformation. Therefore, it**
is essential that they are adequately educated and trained to work in an integrated environment. This demands the revision of professional career development, employment
and the criteria for evaluating results. This reform will be initiated and completed
within one year after the presentation of this document.

**181. Regarding Military Management, the reference points of the review process include:**
**a. the adjustment and modification of the so-called “Normalised Progress” principle,**
established by the law n ° 1137, 12 November 1955, to introduce a system in which
the allocation of general management ranks is derived solely from the need to hold
specific national or international posts. These posts will be proposed by CASMD and
approved by the Minister of Defence;
**b. the establishment of a Joint Force Evaluation Commission, chaired by CASMD, for**
the career advancement of military managers;
**c. the unsuitability for general management positions without a sufficient minimum**
amount of experience in staff organizations or joint command;
**d. the “contractualisation” of the management role, whilst maintaining similar condi-**
tions both in defence and security, includes specific goals, as well as objective means
of assessing them;
**e. the establishment of an organizing body for the management and coordination of all**
human resources destined for joint, international, inter-ministerial assignments, to be
placed under the responsibility of the CASMD.


-----

Defence training structure

**182. The objectives underlying the transformation require a training structure that is**
more homogeneous, without redundancies, and characterized by a unified management
for development and guidance. The restructured training system will be characterized
by three areas for action and guided towards the identification of practical solutions
that are effective, efficient and economical.
**a. Continuous training. The armed forces are constantly evolving and rely more and**
more on the ability to react rapidly and adapt quickly to changing scenarios and needs.
This requires that all military and civilian personnel in defence have a career path with
regular training opportunities alongside their professional activities. Training must
be adequate for each professional career path, and comparable to that of the other
advanced countries with which Italy cooperates. Aspects like the motivation to learn,
the ability to view things long-term and the ability to solve problems, are essential
qualities to be pursued by the Defence education system.
**b. Maximum organisational synergy. The education system will have to be rethought**
in order to provide strong organizational integration of all the activities that are common to the armed forces and civilian personnel. This will leave the armed forces the
sole responsibility of finalizing the training of staff that needs the necessary skills in
their operating environment.
**c.** _Standardization and international training courses. The aim of developing armed_
forces that have a high level of integration and can be perfectly inserted into multinational forces, requires training courses that are not only standardized at national level,
but are also able to meet specific international needs. Therefore, activities and learning
experiences abroad, with full appreciation and recognition of national training, will
also mean an increase in training opportunities for foreign personnel in Italy, with a
view towards progressive European defence integration.

**183. The organization of training with a unified command will be directly responsible**
to the CSMD. The training facility will be a synchronized and synergistic body, which
will acquire, over time, its own legal status. It will have the ability to issue loans and
legal securities for studies and training that is undertaken. In this context, the Military


-----

Academies will maintain their appearance of initial training to operating theatres” and will have the responsibility for technical and vocational training while
shaping the character of all officers. Schools and existing training centres that deal
with educational activities and technical-specialist training missions of a similar
type will be merged and streamlined on the basis of available capabilities and
subject expertise.

**184.** The common management structure must safeguard the unique professional
training of  the individual components. Since education activities also involve the
generation and preparation of the forces, it is necessary that each armed forces retains
the responsibility of defining the specific training needs and the necessary career paths
for technical and professional growth.

**185. Defence schools are the heritage of the whole State and they can increase their**
value by if used for the benefit of the community. Therefore, they will be open to
civilian Defence staff to be trained in specific skills. Access will also be given to
university students and employees of other administrations, depending on interest and
skills. The teaching staff can be civilian also working part-time. Likewise, military
personnel with the requested qualifications may also be used in training activities outside of Defence, with particular regard to activities where their professional skills may
be of interest to the community.

**186.** The military training system will therefore ensure ongoing education to staff
throughout their career, but also facilitate the reintegration of personnel into civilian
life for those who are not destined for permanent service. Its vocation will be international taking shape as a system open to staff of allied countries and friends and
prepared to integrate into the wider context of military training in Europe. Teaching
activities will be open to professionals from other countries, in order to gain the maximum benefit from their experience and knowledge.


-----

Regional organisation and organisms

**187. The modern requirements of simplicity and economy require the evolution pro-**
cess of local bodies and governments to move towards a more integrated status. This
process started over ten years ago and must be rapidly completed. The connection
with the territory will be preserved, along with local communities to ensure support to
citizens in case of need, and to implement the territorial reserve force structure.

**188. The new organization of territorial logistical support will be unified under the**
command of the Logistics Commander of Defence. This will be done to ensure the
fulfilment of management policy requirements that favour organizational simplicity
and reduce infrastructure to a minimum, along with the full integration of the armed
forces.

**189. The local authorities, through specific offices, will also be responsible for divul-**
ging information about Defence, staff recruitment and facilitating the reintegration of
staff into the civilian working world.

Enhancement of values peculiar to each military component

**190.** As part of their activities, the armed forces constantly refer to the moral and
ethical values of the nation they represent. Loyalty, a sense of duty, tradition, the
awareness that a mission might pose a threat and to protect the best interests of the
nation, are part of a culture that should be emphasized, strengthened and passed on to
future generations. These values must permeate all of the Defence staff activities in
the belief that preparation, i.e., respect of human life and a sense of justice, remain the
pillars of public service.

**191. The custodians of these traditions and values are the different components of the**
armed forces. The Army, Navy, Air Force and Carabinieri, in fact, do not only represent their specialized capabilities in their respective theatres of operations, but they


-----

also provide a wealth of traditions, such
as the work ethic, a way of life, values
and a passion for their profession. New
emphasis must be placed on the discovery and sharing of traditions and specialisations with all citizens, both in their
specialised operating areas and through
targeted intervention programs in education and training by military institutions
and training centres.

**192.** In this context, particular attention should be paid to preserving the link that
exists between those “who are” (active personnel) with those “who were” (staff who
have left active service or even belonging to retired personnel associations) and those
“who will be” (personnel in education and training). The memories of the past, remind
us about the efforts to secure freedom and democracy, and the core values of our
society that must guide the actions and form the spirit, of those who will continue to
defend these achievements on a daily basis.

**193.** The choice to serve in a particular force or specialisation, acts to consolidate
the spirit and strengthen the union between professional life and passion. This is decisive when it comes to the performance of an individual who is assigned missions
in conditions of extreme difficulty and high risk. For this reason, the nature and the
characteristics of each Armed Force will be retained and enhanced.

Capabilities to be generated for an integrated national force

**194. According to what was mentioned in Chapter 5, i.e. regarding the lessons lear-**
ned and implications for the armed forces with the need to operate effectively during
assigned tasks, the military will have to prepare a number of forces and capabilities.
The range of these capabilities must be sufficient enough to allow the right balance


-----

between the various operational needs and flexible enough to cope with the changing
requirements and to act on short notice.

**195. The armed forces will have to have adequate joint operational capability:**

-  integrated into all the NATO forces to counter any military aggression against Italy
and its vital interests, operating in the three physical dimensions, the human factor and
cybernetics;

-  interoperable with allied forces, to conduct military operations aimed at defending
the alliance system of which Italy is a part, as well as safeguarding peace and international security.

**196. In terms of priorities for action, the military must be calibrated in order to offer**
a range of capabilities to intervene primarily in the Euro-Mediterranean region and,
in accordance with NATO commitments, in the Euro-Atlantic area. Italy must also
eventually be able to lead, a multinational operation in crisis management and the
restoration of peace and security. Outside of priority actions, existing capabilities will
have to be improved so there are more resources available for deliberate short term military intervention. This is in order to compete with other countries in the international
community for the protection of international security.

**197.** Italy therefore, will have to have balanced and diversified ground forces. The
nation and the priority areas of intervention include, in fact, different types of terrain. In possible crisis situations, it may also be required to carry out rapid troop deployments to deal with high-conflict situations. For these reasons, the ground forces
will maintain a proper balance of light, medium and heavy forces, deployable and
up-to-date equipped. Units will be appropriately structured in line with their different
skills with the criteria of modular training, ensuring adequate capacity for logistic and
tactical support. Some forces will be available for stabilization measures and longerterm reconstruction, for which they will have to be supported by additional forces and
the reserves. They will be equipped appropriately to operate effectively in complex
theatres of operation.


-----

**198. As part of the possible actions that involve conflict prevention and post-conflict**
stabilization, specialized Carabinieri units are very useful and effective alongside units
of civilian and military police. Their availability must be guaranteed as a possible
choice.

**199. With regards to naval forces in the areas of priority interest and where potential**
threats to the freedom of maritime trade and access to resources exist, Italy will have
to have a naval force able to operate in environments that are characterized by high
risks and carry out prolonged surveillance and patrols in areas of lesser risk.

**200. A modern navy will be preserved albeit consistent with the available resources,**
and national capabilities, for force deployment from the sea and able to intervene at
short notice in areas also with limited availability of infrastructure.

**201. With regards to the air force, it should be equipped with adequate defence capa-**
bilities and air superiority, which includes ground support and precision engagement
capability. In expected areas of priority action, the air force will be called upon to
conduct high-risk missions from the early stages of a crisis situation and will be up
against modern defences, for example when enforcing “no-fly zone” areas. For these
reasons it will be essential to have equipment and systems designed for high survival
and provide effective protection for personnel, as well as the capability to neutralize
hostile anti-access defences and communication links in command and control centres.

**202. The ability to move people, equipment and materials quickly in areas of crisis**
will remain an essential factor to contain any crisis before it can develop into prolonged conflict. Sufficient capability with multiple means of transport i.e. by land, air
or sea, must be achieved through the development of national military capabilities,
through agreements with civilian carriers, and through multinational participation and
resource sharing initiatives.

**203. As noted before, the availability of substantial special force capability will re-**
main essential for special force operations and their support units. This capability will


-----

be strengthened and enhanced. It will be necessary to acquire and maintain state-ofthe-art equipment and effectively manage information with command and control, in
order to conduct joint or combined complex military campaigns, including traditional
combat operations and new forms of asymmetric and hybrid conflict.

Major development programmes

**204. One of the Defence’s priorities will be the development of a “Strategic Defence**
Review” (SDR), which includes a new edition of the Long-term Planning. This work,
developed under the supervision and management of the political authority, remains
in line with this document, and aimed at the correct identification of technical and
operational solutions for the future evolution of the military. This will be in terms of
transport, weapon systems and force structure.

**205. This comprehensive review appreciates what has been completed to date, in order**
not to waste investments and acquired capabilities. The Strategic Defence Review
may lead to a reduction or rethinking of certain capabilities, as ongoing choices, but
will represent progressive change, that also acknowledges those already made in the
armed forces.

**206. Finally, the contents of the Strategic Review will act as reference for formula-**
ting long term legislation that regards Defence investment which the Government will
submit to Parliament for consideration and approval.

Personnel as a strategic resource

**207. Human resources play a key role in all complex organizations, and are all the**
more vital to Defence which places huge demands on individuals in terms of sense
of duty, self-sacrifice, and professionalism. Therefore, personnel are central in guaranteeing the nation an armed force capable of ensuring the defence of the State, and
contributing effectively to the achievement of international security.

**208. The characteristics of personnel, their technical and specialist skills, and the lea-**
dership skills of commanders, training, and professionalism have made it possible to
ensure in the long term the defence capabilities of the nation guaranteeing a leading
role in the international arena. In the future, the quality and effectiveness of the military and civilian personnel of the Ministry of Defence will be decisive factors in
ensuring the capabilities required of our armed forces.


-----

**209.** The significant quota of the Defence budget allocated to personnel and their
training reflects the desire to provide the Defence with a professional, flexible, and
highly-qualified workforce. This investment is particularly important in times like
these when technical equipment is increasingly complex and continuously changing
scenarios require diverse professional qualities, different operational capabilities, and
absolute dedication.

**210. Our society is rich in human qualities, diversity, initiative and adaptability, and**
our armed forces reflect these general qualities. The human skills and professional
expertise asked of our Defence, however, must be made sufficiently attractive, and
motivate personnel adequately, to encourage them to serve with undiminished energy
and dedication over long periods of time. In this context, the government recognizes
that the Defence’s approach to personnel must be flexible and attentive if promoting
the idea that serving your country in arms is a worthy profession and life choice. Only
by attracting and retaining personnel who are motivated, and who possess the qualities
and skills required, will the Defence accomplish its assigned tasks.

Recruitment and personnel structure

**211. A professional model will characterize the armed forces of the next two deca-**
des by a more contained size and by the need to operate often far from home or in
deployment military bases in areas of conflict or complexity. The requirement is for
a youthful force that is numerically flexible, professionally prepared and with a streamlined, well-proportioned staff structure based on rank, role, and specialisation. This
force structure should also have a high degree of “operational usability”, that is, it
should be able to operate in complex environments, far from fixed bases for long
periods and therefore personnel should be able to accept minor constraints on their
personal life, be physically fit, and prepared for self-sacrifice.

**212.** It thereby follows that personnel to be recruited must be carefully selected,
educated and trained, and must represent an image of our country in the multipli

city of professional qualities, origins,
and social status. The armed forces
should not, in fact, be perceived as a
“separate body” apart from society but,
on the contrary, as the highest form of
public service capable of guaranteeing
the defence and security of the nation,
like all the security sector forces. Every
effort will be made to ensure that there
is integration between military personnel and citizens, in order to maintain the balance and vital bonds between the armed
forces, institutions, and citizens.

**213. In order to satisfy the key structural requirement for personnel to have a relati-**
vely low average age, being a member of the “military profession” cannot constitute
the entire working life for every member of the force. For remaining personnel, serving one’s country shall represent only a part, albeit a highly-qualified part, of one’s
curriculum vitae.

**214. Personnel must be adequately supported by a range of provisions conducive to the**
exercise of his or her profession and must be facilitated in his or her reintegration into
the civilian work environment. Personnel must be motivated by work environments
that are characterized by professional competence and respect for role and position;
and must receive a fair salary in proportion not only to rank and responsibility, but also
to risk, professionalism, and length of service.

**215. With regard to personnel recruitment, the suspension of conscription will conti-**
nue. On the other hand, we shall see the introduction of new methods of recruitment
and voluntary service, and professionals in permanent service, necessary to achieve
desired goals of efficiency, effectiveness and operation in line with resources available.
In such a scenario, it is appropriate to place special emphasis on the complete success
of women’s voluntary military service. Today, fifteen years after its introduction into


-----

our organisation, the practice must be considered fully positive: female personnel not
only provide a significant contribution in many fields, but also, like in other advanced
nations, enjoy broad access to all the employment opportunities that the Defence can
offer. Achieving complete equality, however, will necessitate continuing attention to
developing the participation of female Defence personnel with particular reference to
the issue of career advancement.

**216.** It will therefore be necessary to study, test and introduce a new “Professional
Model” that combines different needs. In particular:

-  increase the percentage of relatively young personnel in the armed forces to maintain
the efficiency of the operational component which will grow in proportion to the overall size of the structure;

-  recruit the required number of young, highly-qualified men and women offering adequate pay, incentives, attractive and dynamic work proposals, and a credible system
of reintegration into the civilian workforce, ensuring full equal employment opportunities and career advancement;

-  place more value on the professionalism and experience gained during periods of
operational activity;

-  programme the coordinated insertion of the recruitment model, status and progress
into the Defence and Security Sector;

-  introduce specific regulations on the reintegration into civilian employment of personnel who serve only for a limited number of years.

**217.** New recruitment, enlistment, advancement and career development methods
should aim to achieve the indicated goals, bearing in mind, however, the following:

-  the career path and system of recruitment for troops, graduates and NCOs will be
broadly similar, therefore it will be possible to reach the rank and the functions programmed for graduates, sergeants and warrant officers after an initial period of service
in the troops;

-  warrant officers will be allocated the tasks and responsibilities of top positions among
the non-commissioned officers in line with Security Sector provisions;

-  in the case of officers, with some exceptions, there will be two forms of entry into the


-----

armed forces: one for normal roles and one for complementary and supportive roles.
At the end of the latter’s enlistment period, personnel destined to continue their career
shall be selected via competitive exam;

-  in order to achieve the objectives and the anticipated savings within credible time
limits, an assessment of the possibility of complementary measures and retirement
schemes for permanent staff will need to be made.

**218. New regulations on recruitment and career development are to be implemented**
soon, in line with adjustments to the selection, education and training processes of
the armed forces. Special regulations will outline the period of transition to the new
regime.

Education and training

**219. One of the requirements identified as a priority for the armed forces of the future,**
is the need for higher quality in terms of education and training. The evolution of future geopolitical scenarios, in fact, requires that the technological-cognitive dimension
becomes more prominent and more prevalent than other dimensions. Only personnel
with superior knowledge and skills, and perfect knowledge and mastery of equipment
supplied will, in fact, guarantee full operability. Furthermore, the expected relatively
high turnover of personnel will require a significant ever-growing ability to educate
and train new recruits quickly and to high standards, to bring them quickly to suitable
levels of efficiency and effectiveness.

**220. It is also necessary to expand national capabilities dedicated to the education and**
training of the armed forces of allies and partners who need to rebuild and strengthen
their capability for autonomous self-defence. These modes of support in crisis situations have now become particularly important to future scenarios. They are functional
in the process of stabilization and essential for security and stability without having to
employ large contingents abroad.


-----

**221. As representatives of Defence and the nation abroad, personnel in the internatio-**
nal arena must exemplify the highest possible moral and professional qualities. For
these reasons, and especially for positions of greater prominence, personnel shall be
carefully selected and trained. Finally, with a view to greater integration, a project to
ensure the placement of military and diplomatic representatives shall be launched.

**222. We should not forget the additional role the Defence can play for younger citizens**
in terms of increasing their level of technical and specialised knowledge useful for the
world of work. In the past when still based on the conscription model, the armed forces had not only the role of consolidating moral values thereby strengthening national
unity - establishing for everyone that the highest form of duty was that of defending
the nation - but also played a very important social function. The armed forces have, in
fact, given millions of young people the opportunity to get to know their own country
and the citizens of other countries, to improve their command of the spoken and written language, and to learn useful skills to increase their employment prospects.

**223. Today, in a profoundly different reality, the armed forces can still play a similar**
role: to serve one’s own country, therefore, can be not only a source of pride and a
lifestyle choice, but also a useful opportunity to train for a job, to improve skills in or
learn a profession by developing, at the same time, foreign language, leadership, and
teamwork skills.

**224. The characteristics of educational and training excellence which shall be streng-**
thened by the armed forces will ultimately result in an added value for the nation. The
latter can take advantage of the unique capabilities possessed by the Defence in many
specialist fields, their training facilities, and training missions resulting in a close correlation between the “Social System” and the “Defence System”.

**225. Both reaching and maintaining high-quality personnel training levels is a con-**
dition that multiplies capabilities and allows full interoperability with allied nations.
Achievement of the agreed minimum training standards within NATO and the EU is
therefore a non-negotiable objective that will ensure the armed forces has the ability to


-----

operate safely and effectively in the spectrum of assigned tasks. Reaching this objective demands that existing training paths be integrated, optimized and maintained over
time to ensure full exploitation of existing national capabilities but also looking for
the best solution in international cooperation should the national response fail to be
cost-effective due to economies of scale or high unit costs. Similarly, national training
areas and related structures shall be preserved to permit required activities.

**226.** In order to achieve the objectives required in terms of operational readiness,
adaptability and efficiency of use, the future Training Model should possess the following characteristics:
**a.** _Realism and training intensity._ Every training period must place a high level of
importance on creating realistic situations, that is, allow personnel to experience practical operational situations, not limited to those which occur most commonly, but also
hypothetical or less frequent ones. The use of technologies for virtual experiences
should be extended to as much equipment as possible, as well as to procedures for
command and control. The use of such systems should allow an increase in situational training for personnel, minimize the risk of operational surprises and increase the
safety of staff, also reducing the impact of training activities on the community to a
minimum;
**b. Joint Training Structure. The use of the armed forces as a synergetic unit requires the**
development of operating procedures that are as standardized as possible in terms of
work concepts and operating procedures. Although it is necessary for each component
to train individually in order to operate safely and effectively in specific operational
contexts, the armed forces must achieve a high level of integration in terms of facilities
and participate in joint training exercises with common goals. The rationalization
of organization and infrastructures will be achieved with an approach that exploits
operational expertise possessed in the operating environment, and takes into account
an objective evaluation of the excellent infrastructures and training systems possessed
by each component;
**c.** _Multi-nationalization of training._ The objectives of wider integration at European level and a high degree of operational interoperability with allied nations require
that staff work jointly, effectively, and safely. Such requirements necessarily require


-----

that most training activities, in particular more complex ones, are conducted at an
international level and according to procedures and protocols uniformly shared. For
these reasons, the Defence will support the execution of training activities at complex
multinational level, seeking all possible forms of international integration for those
that traditionally were held nationwide;
**d. Evaluation of training. Careful evaluation of training activities is essential for lear-**
ning and for the improvement of the military organisation in times of peace.

Personnel structure and careers

**227.** As in any complex structure, in the armed forces career progression is based
on the correct execution of managerial activities and execution of tasks. Over time,
the structure and composition of the socalled hierarchical pyramid has changed,
and is influenced by four main factors.
The first is technological development of
the equipment whose full and correct use
requires not only higher technical, but
also analytical and leadership, capabilities. The second consists of the progressive multi-nationalization of operations
and command structures: the participation of the European Union, NATO and the UN
requires the presence in common structures of permanent, highly-qualified military
and civilian personnel. The third factor is the increasing complexity of operational
scenarios, which require levels of professionalism, responsibility and leadership skills
of the highest nature. The last factor, finally, is related to the transformation of society
itself towards one that is strongly characterized by the value of “knowledge”. The
combination of these factors leads to growth in personnel’s role and functions providing the highest levels of professionalism and responsibility, leading to the need for a
ranking structure different from what seemed necessary in the past.


-----

**228.** However, parallel to this development, greater operational levels remain fundamental. Although the requirement for more extensive and sophisticated technical
knowledge is, also in this case, clear, the need remains unchanged to have professionally trained and motivated personnel of an appropriate age for intense operational
tasks. They must also possess unique physical qualities and moral character, and be
aware that the period of employment will be marked by a very dynamic life experience. To meet this need, the armed forces must provide a personnel structure with a broad operational base, a well-balanced, diversified middle management, and a relatively
small leadership, especially those occupying senior positions.

**229. For each category, the career paths of personnel will develop from the lower ranks**
according to career progression that will necessarily involve a significant portion of
time spent performing operational tasks. Within each category and according to the
number of permanent staff, the ability to reach top ranks must be guaranteed, in theory,
to all personnel. Even more than today, career progression will be selective on the
basis of indisputable and proven ability, professionalism, qualifications held including
degrees, and experience. Furthermore, it will develop according to transparent evaluation criteria that are as objective as possible based on the measurable achievement
of objectives. In order to promote this objective, the Defence will introduce a new
uniform evaluation system covering these requisites.

**230. The overall number of top ranks of troops, sergeants and warrant officers will**
be limited and related to the number of positions provided. The achievement of these
ranks, therefore, does not represent the normal culmination of career advancement,
but the recognition of the achievement of excellence and special merits acquired on
the career path. Similarly, higher managerial ranks will be attributed only when precise positions need to be filled, providing a progression system that allows continual
exchange. No promotions will be granted on the basis of length of service or current
rank: all progress will require a specific classification based on an assessment of moral qualities, professional aptitude and achievements. Finally, no promotions shall be
made on discharge from service.


-----

Civilian Defence personnel

**231.** With the aim of creating a synergistic
system, the Defence will pay particular attention to integration processes, development
and full use of the expertise possessed by nonmilitary personnel. The civilian component of
the Defence will be an increasingly valuable
pool of technical, administrative and managerial skills that will assume a role of greater
responsibility in many activities for which the specific condition of the military and its
professionalism are an essential added value.

**232.** The configuration and mode of recruitment of civilian personnel shall be reviewed in the reform policies of the Public service carried out by the government
to solve problems of reduced mobility, lesser flexibility and higher average age, as
well as homogeneous remuneration. If indispensable for obvious reasons of parity,
provision will be included with regard to civilians, in the case of the same operational
employment abroad, for salaries equivalent to those paid to military personnel.

**233. As is the case in many European countries and along with reform policies of the**
Public service carried out by the Government, research will be carried out on forms of
employment for the civilian personnel of the Defence that shall allow, for the future
and over time, a rebalancing of the numbers of temporary and permanent staff providing forms of support for the delicate time of transition to other business sectors.

**234. Measures will be implemented to finally overcome those “barriers” that have tra-**
ditionally limited civilians working for the Defence to prescribed duties and functions,
excluding them from others which are appropriate to their skills but which have traditionally been carried out by military personnel. In order to fulfil specific requirements,
flexible career paths and part-time forms of work, both for temporary and permanent
employment, will ultimately be designed.


-----

**235. In addition, in order to promote job placements and the creation of experience**
and professionalism, research shall also be made into the possibility of offering shortterm work placements in favour of:

_- university students (working with university departments for agreement on the pro-_
per evaluation of periods of service in the context of training);

_- specialized technicians, involving private companies and research centres to ensure_
that training translates into real possibilities of future employment that will prove
stable over time.

**236. This transformation will be supported ensuring civilian access to Defence trai-**
ning and instruction, to provide steady and progressive training throughout careers, to
develop professional skills, and to define career paths that are in line with the new and
more complex responsibilities to be taken on.

Health and safety at work

**237.** For the organization of Defence,
which normally operates with risk margins higher than those of other professional activities, health and safety at work
are issues of great importance and priority, and are subject to the specific nature
of the conditions of military training
and operations. Ensuring employment
conditions that prevent potential risks to
personnel, reducing as far as possible, the consequences of ill health that could arise
from operating in harsh and complex environments, is a moral duty towards those who
perform public service for the community, even before due respect is paid to existing
regulations. Equally essential is to ensure that citizens have full knowledge of the
rules with which the Defence works and the possible impact on the territory of such
activities.


-----

**238. In this context, risk prevention activities, training, and information for citizens**
and personnel will be reinforced, acting along main lines of action, in full agreement
with both local and national prevention and control agencies.
**a. First, the Ministry will continue working on the collection, analysis, evaluation and**
dissemination of all statistical data on infirmity and mortality of civilian and military
Defence personnel, by cooperating actively in the search for causes of the onset of
certain diseases, in accordance with scientific and methodological rigour.
**b.** The detection and monitoring of chemical and radiological elements potentially
generated by the activities of Defence in some specific sites will be enhanced, and
centralized database also accessible to supervisory bodies will be created.
**c. Training courses, retraining and information courses will be gradually increased and**
made widely available to staff and managers, for the protection of health, safety in the
workplace, food hygiene, environmental protection, and technical-specialist courses
for the safety of facilities and equipment.
**d. Employers will be asked to put in place a number of positive actions aimed at ensu-**
ring that the value of health and safety in the workplace is assimilated by the workers
themselves so that it becomes, in practice, ordinary working practice.

Financial remuneration

**239. The philosophy that will underlie the evolution of salaries in the future armed for-**
ces will be based both on professional development and rank. The personnel structure
of the armed forces, in fact, will be characterised by a hierarchical pyramid that will
offer progression of rank related to performance and commitment, to merit and diverse
opportunities for professional growth and specialization.

**240. The structure of recruitment and career progression outlined also highlights how**
the military profession will represent, for some of the personnel, only a part, albeit
significant, of their overall work experience.


-----

**241.** Finally, as in every professional system, personnel will be encouraged to join
the organization, motivated to remain and stimulated to operate over time with undiminished enthusiasm. This requires that the salary structure be competitive and that
it rewards not only professionalism and experience, but also the complexities of the
activity and the specific role, on a competitive basis as in other sectors of society.

**242. All these requirements, however, require research into salary dynamics different**
from the current ones, but still compatible with the public service. Fair remuneration
should be made for the increased responsibility that accompanies higher ranks, the
risk, professionalism and seniority, as well as the specific condition imposed by being
a military employee, all subject to remaining part of the Defence-Security Sector regarding legal and economic order.

**243. The success of the future military, therefore, requires that also from the point of**
view of salary, provisions are implemented so that the choice of serving one’s country
does not penalise staff, thereby discouraging enlistment or decreasing motivation. In
full compatibility with available resources three reforms to overcome these problems
will be progressively implemented:

-  the first aims to modify the current structure of remuneration, in order to come to a
salary settlement in which the base parameter has more value than accessory parameters;

-  the second regards the need for greater recognition of responsibilities, professionalism, and length of service;

-  the third concerns the introduction, at the end of temporary active service in the
armed forces without demerit;

-  of an allowance that is meaningful and proportionate to the period of service performed. This allowance will act, together with other provisions that will be implemented,
as a further instrument of remuneration for service and support in the process of reintegration into the civilian world.


-----

Reintegration into the civilian work environment and the value of professionalism

**244.** All the elements presented depict a military component in which the human
element plays a central role with professionalism being essential for its success.
The possibility that such a model can be
developed fully correlates to the level
of professional enhancement obtainable
for military and civilian personnel and
that, in turn, will serve to determine not
only the operational effectiveness of the
armed forces, but also the attractiveness
of the profession, the motivation and the
real possibility of reintegration into employment of excess personnel.

**245. Defence staff act in many professional fields, manage equipment with a high level**
of technological sophistication and operate in national and international environments
characterized by considerable levels of complexity. These factors have always involved the development of different professionals at all levels, which, however, have
not always found the correct recognition in the context of the civilian working world
except in very limited cases.

**246.** The success of the work of modernization, the possibility for temporary staff
to more easily find a position in the job market, and the need to render public sector
personnel more flexible, resides not only in the ability to properly recognise their qualifications and skills, but also in the ability to match the supply of skills with the needs
of the national production system. In order to facilitate this process, the Defence will
introduce two specific initiatives: the “Youth Project” and the “Future Work Project”.


-----

**247. The** _Youth Project will enhance the ability of the armed forces to create strong_
values and a sense of solidarity, as well as promoting social, cultural and professional
growth. The existing training structures and training missions of the armed forces are
able to offer professional training suitable for institutional positions, particularly for
younger staff doing fixed-term military service and civilian and military personnel
who need to retrain and find another job. However, it also facilitates the reintegration
into the civilian world at the end of the period of service. Therefore the Defence has
“dual” training and education capabilities.

**248. There are many areas where this initiative will find real application: from basic**
training to professional practice, where direct experience of working in the military
world is considered solid experience and is also valuable in the civilian world. The
project also provides for the recognition of qualifications obtained during service,
making them equivalent to corresponding civilian qualifications, and endorsing the
experience gained working with the military with the creation of a military “professio_nal curriculum vitae” certified by the administration. The latter will be used to attest to_
specific work experience at the time of placement in the job market. The new Training
structure will be responsible for the implementation and updating of the project, as
well as for the certification of professional qualifications and curricula.

**249. The “Future Work Project” represents the effort that the government will make**
in order to support the reintegration of personnel into the civilian world - by matching
supply and demand. The Ministry of Defence interacts with other government departments, with international organizations and with many economic and social bodies, which are useful to facilitate the reintegration of staff into the civilian world.

**250. The project involves the creation of a database of skills possessed by personnel,**
the signing of agreements by employers who value the skills, discipline and work
ethics that the experience of military service can offer and the creation of a structure
dedicated to supporting personnel who need assistance.


-----

Citizens and the armed forces

**251. For the Defence and Security Sector, Article 19 of Law 4, November 2010, no.**
183 introduced the concept of “specificity” because of the specific tasks assigned to
military personnel, and the obligations imposed by their fulfilment. It is recognition of
a “special status” and must be taken into account in the regulations of key aspects of
the working relationship with the Public Administration. In this context, for example,
we have the complex theme of Military Representation, which will not be addressed
here as it is the prerogative parliament.

**252.** With regard to the administration of the military criminal justice system, the
government intends to continue its efforts to improve the efficiency of the system,
streamlining it and also studying the possibility of a legally evolved system based
on the principle of the uniqueness of criminal jurisdiction, proposing the adoption in
peacetime, of bodies specialised in military criminal matters, incorporated within the
ordinary justice system.

**253. Regarding general aspects of the care of personnel, the government intends to ful-**
fil an obligation, first of all moral, towards members of the Defence, securing respect,
support and fair treatment for those who, sacrificed themselves and their personal
rights, and faced danger in order to be faithful to their oath. The most natural way
to progress in this new perspective is to recognise a real “pact” between the entire
nation, the government and the armed forces that recognizes the support, the concrete
expression of gratitude towards those belonging to the armed forces and their families.
Among the issues to consider there are the conditions of service, fair salary, health
care, education, mobility at home and abroad, retraining for the civilian job market,
and pension schemes.

**254.** Obviously, it is a non-exhaustive list of areas of life, typical of armed forces
personnel, devolved mostly to non-Military organisations, but also to the state whose
involvement is indispensable. Hence the need for a government commitment to facilitate, in practical terms, the bridge between the military sphere and civilian life. From


-----

this pact it is necessary to identify those institutions whose competences are in specific
policy areas: in addition local authorities must be the ministries of reference for all that
concerns health matters, education and vocational training in preparation for re-entry
into the job market.

**255. Regions, provinces and municipalities will be able to become privileged partners**
of their ex-Military citizens even in the search for synergy in areas like housing and
local taxation. The military community, often highly cohesive, will be available to
participate in joint initiatives of direct interest in the area. The services involved can be
calibrated on the basis of the objective to be achieved and would go from sharing legislative initiatives, to signing the simplest and most flexible agreements or contracts,
to manifestations of the most basic social life. In this framework, initiatives of “friendship”, exchanges between the military community and local communities may reveal
themselves of fundamental importance. The contribution of military personnel in the
projects concerning the redevelopment of public spaces, or in volunteer initiatives
undertaken in support of the most vulnerable sections of the population (the elderly,
disabled, etc.) would, in fact, be further tangible example of the real partnership of exMilitary citizens in the social life of the nation and a new opportunity for appreciation
and gratitude towards them.

**Industrial policies for science and innovation**

# 9

General scenario

**256. In addition to a Military component capable of expressing the correct and necessary**
capabilities, our defence system cannot exist without a certain level of industrial and
technological independence so that it can meet at least part of our needs at the national
level or through participation in multinational initiatives for development and acquisition.
Also putting ourselves in a perspective of strong international cooperation, the need to
develop and maintain a strong technological and industrial base is a security factor for the
protection of national interests. It enables the mastery of certain technologies, the use of
full potential, and the tailoring of applications to specific national needs, keeping them up
to date in a situation characterized by their rapid obsolescence.


-----

**257. Advanced technologies and adequate industrial capabilities are also necessary for de-**
veloping new products on an equal footing collaboratively, for strengthening integration
with our European partners, and for forging links with other friendly countries. Finally,
contributing to the overall growth of the nation, considering that security and defence
represent one of the few areas of advanced national technology still presided over by our
nation. This requires attention to be paid to the activities of acquisition and modernization
of the equipment of the armed forces, but also to those designed to ensure the maintenance
of adequate national technological and manufacturing capability to support, at least in part
and bearing in mind potential interdependence with our main partners, and national needs.

**258.** In the last twenty years, the
market for Defence equipment
has been profoundly transformed
by the emergence of new trends.
While, for example, “platforms”
tend to extend their life cycle,
technological innovation, and in
particular the pervasive spread of
electronics in terms of products
and industrial processes, leads to
premature ageing of “equipment”. This implies, in principle, the need for a continuous
system adjustment and/or the need to shorten the development time of the programmes.
Technological innovation in civilian markets also makes technologies, spare parts and
equipment used for military needs available lowering the entrance barriers for new suppliers. It is more difficult, therefore, but also more important, to monitor overall technological development even beyond that which is strictly military and to consider “civil”
needs to become potentially associated with military ones. The Armed Forces must therefore maintain adequate technological skills to identify and define their needs.

**259. The reduction in demand of Western countries and the search for new markets in a**
global international market, have led to a process of concentration and globalisation of
large industrial groups destined to grow. Parallel to this, the size of large industrial groups


-----

destabilise, especially in Europe, the relationship between domestic demand and global
supply weakening the traditional control capabilities of States and their defences. Although the European and international dimension prevails now in all European countries over
the national and despite increases in bilateral or multilateral programmes of European
collaboration, military acquisitions are still set on the national dimension. Hence, the need
for greater impetus towards European co-operation in the development, acquisition and
logistic support of a military nature.

The security and defence industry

**260. The industry of Defence and Security is a pillar of technology, manufacturing, em-**
ployment, and economic growth and is unmatched in the “national system”, which contributes mainly through three elements:

-  it provides the development of platforms and systems for the armed forces, both for
defence and national security, and for missions abroad. The capability of the armed forces allows Italy to be a respected member of the international community and to play a
leading role in the scenarios of national interest. The pairing “military industry- national
industry “ increases the “level of ambition” of the “National System” to the level of
international relations;

-  it contributes to technological development through programmes and investments in
research and development and, more generally, to economic growth through the direct,
indirect and induced effects on GDP and the creation of skilled jobs;

-  t contributes, through exports, to the balancing of trade balances and the promotion
of products of domestic industry in sectors with high remuneration, fostering our relationships with other countries.

Technological competence

**261.** A comprehensive system of Defence and Security also requires a wealth of
scientific-technological and industrial knowledge which allows the development of


-----

products and systems based on distinct technological competence that is as
autonomous as it is collaborative, so as
to create a strategic competitive advantage for the nation. The gradual development of such distinctive technological skills in a competitive industrial
base internationally, is essential to have
autonomous powers that can meet the
specific needs of the armed forces. In
addition, the identification of distinctive technological competencies enables participation in programmes of collaboration
with international partners in any given role and with qualified personnel and supports
international relations through projects transferring technology or cooperation with
other countries.

**262. By sovereign competence is meant critical technological capabilities, those key**
enablers, including dual-use technologies, which the country is in possession of or
needs to acquire. Of these competencies it is necessary to maintain a degree of national sovereignty, irrespective of international cooperation, since they are essential and
indispensable in order to meet the needs of:
-national defence, through the supply of military equipment to the armed forces to
ensure basic operational capability and safety of supply;

-  national interest, through the international influence, including economic, that the
features of these technologies provide globally.

**263.** To ensure the security of the supply chain and to sustain growth in the “national
system”, the design, development and production of technologies important to sovereign
skills will be maintained on national territory, regardless of ownership. The identification
of sovereign competencies, in which the country must be autonomous and associated and
constantly changing technologies will be defined identifying the needs of medium and
long term capability, and the actual technological and industrial capabilities in the Nation.


-----

**264. Necessary autonomy, however, must be matched by economic sustainability, and**
must be pursued by combining, to supply national demand, the ability to cooperate internationally with selected partners, and through export opportunities in international
markets.

**265. Collaborative skills are necessary in order to work together with partners in the**
division of labour at the European level, deriving from the desired specialization
and technological interdependence. The Defence shall identify which technologies
and systems need to be pursued through partnerships, especially European, in order
to maintain and strengthen national capabilities. In those areas where excellence in
technological knowledge is present, but is not the immediate needs of the national armed forces, possible export markets of interest should be identified in order to ensure
the maintenance of technological and industrial capabilities.

**266.** Exports represent important resources useful in intergovernmental relations
important to military cooperation. With these, partnership policies and technology
transfer can be developed, focusing on “inter-governmental” agreements. In this perspective, the Defence will continue to provide its support to domestic industry, also in
coordination with other competent administrations.

**267. In this context, it is necessary to provide for the identification of strategic indu-**
strial and technological activities in the field of Defence and Security through a specific
“plan” to be kept regularly updated. On the one hand, this evaluation must consider the
needs of the armed forces, and, on the other, the effective technological and industrial
capabilities. The latter should be selected taking into account the judgement of the
armed forces, capability of export, and participation in international collaboration,
duality, and impact on technological innovation also with reference to the market. To
this end, the “Plan” will be also be defined by comparison with industry.

**268. By defining the technological solutions to address the capability gap, the “Plan”**
will also contribute to the definition of priorities to be supported by the government
and the authorities involved, with a process that will involve all the ministries and


-----

bodies of the State, which will contribute to both the definition of requirements, and
financial support programs. That prospect may find even greater force in the field of
dual use technologies, where interests and the involvement of other public entities are
stronger.

Science and technology

**269. The world of science, knowled-**
ge and technological innovation is
the future of our country and the
cornerstone of our autonomy. It
is, therefore, fundamental to the
international security and defence
strategy of the nation. The Defence,
therefore, will adopt policies that
promote growth paths with projects
of the highest scientific and technological content and openness towards the civilian world of the capabilities possessed
in research, applied knowledge and operational testing. Likewise, on an international
scale, the skills and technical-scientific knowledge possessed by the armed forces are
both a “business card” of the nation and of its quality and professionalism, both real
tools to create opportunities for international cooperation, also in the fields of technological research and transport systems.

**270.** Science, technology, and research and development are therefore crucial elements of reference for the development of a national strategy for growth, to which
the Defence will contribute actively. In order to improve and strengthen dual research
and to allow the nation to benefit from initiatives of collaboration, the Defence will
advocate a substantial adjustment of financial resources for research and development
in relation to specific projects and initiatives to strengthen capability in the field of
Defence and Security where priority projects are identified at European level.


-----

**271. The National Plan of Military Research (PNRM) is to enjoy increasing harmony**
and integration with National Research (PNR), in order to concentrate research activities on issues identified as priorities. Thanks to the cooperation between Defence,
industry and the scientific world, aimed at future development programmes, great
benefit can be obtained from the know-how, resulting in reduced risk, costs, and the
timing of programmes.

**272. Another aid for the harmony and coherence of technological research at national**
level is the development of the “matrix of enabling technologies”, of achieved or desirable excellence, prioritising to the most strategic. The matrix will be shared among
all ministries and State bodies concerned, and with national industry. It will bring
together all public needs at a national level, offering support, and at ministerial level,
by developing a coordinated policy of investment and action.

Global dimension of the defence sector

**273. The global dimension of the Defence Industry is closely related to positive deve-**
lopment in a more integrated and shared security policy and defence of the European
Union as well as NATO. In Europe, both NATO, through the initiative of “Smart
Defence”, and the PSDC, with that of “Pooling & Sharing”, have long since begun a
process aimed at enhancing the efficiency of military capabilities and enabling closer
international cooperation.

**274. To that end, the programs of European and international cooperation contribute**
to increasing the shared features of equipment and to reducing development and acquisition costs, and retention. In this framework, the lessons of experience shall be
valued, to further reduce time and costs through new solutions that ensure nevertheless
an “inclusive” approach able to involve those nations with the skills and willingness
to participate. When fully implemented, these initiatives could gradually lead to greater interdependence among European countries of NATO and the EU Member States
to force technological-industrial specialization, a symptom of real division of labour


-----

through industrial policies of European Defence, covering all sectors of the AS&D
industry. This evolution requires, however, a closer level of political and military cooperation without which the integration process could be weakened.

**275.** The military capabilities developed in international cooperation with NATO
allies and EU Member States will therefore require a more extensive and effective
consultation and coordination capability, to avoid redundancy and to ensure that gaps
are not created nor damage caused to the security of supply schemes or control of
technological and industrial structures. The security of supply in EU Member States,
in fact, is necessary to strengthen the single market for Defence. These nations, in fact,
will not be favourable to outlined changes if they do not have the security to meet their
military needs in a fast, safe and unhindered fashion. This requires that the European
Union focuses on greater liberalization of intra-EU transfers of military products for
the armed forces in Europe.

**276. This development reinforces the need to identify and support areas of national**
technological excellence. This poses difficult choices for the nation about the skills
and technologies to be held, to be protected by encouraging recognition and use in the
European context.

The relationship between Defence and industry

**277. The cornerstone of the national strategy for Security and Defence, even within**
the perspective of a process of European integration in the Defence Sector, is the
close collaboration between industry and the Ministry of Defence. The term “extended” operational needs and the resulting technical requirements are key elements in
a policy of security and integrated defence. Operational needs and technical-military
requirements for creating priority capability, in fact, are derived from the tasks and
missions assigned to the Military. They must also keep in mind the possibility that
the same technical requirements and associated technologies have a wide utility also
for other national needs. This can only be guaranteed by a strong interrelationship


-----

between Defence, industry and other ministries responsible for the various sectors. In
particular:

-  at the national level, it is necessary to adapt existing technical and administrative
regulations, both to allow acquisitions over long periods, and in terms of contractual
conditions and, more generally, arrangements governing the acquisition process and
acceptance of the supplies for the Ministry of Defence. The goal is simplification and
speeding up of procedures.

-  at the European level, considering development, the acquisition process will be able
to become more and more joint and multinational, allowing financial savings in terms
of economies of scale, better interoperability, and operational integration. This objective can be achieved by stimulating the strengthening of the skills and capabilities
of existing European agencies, such as EDA and OCCAR, with the contribution of
nationally qualified staff.

**278. It is also necessary to review acquisitions models, taking inspiration from best**
practices at the European level, inserting long term logistic support into the purchase
contract and, if needed, periods of initial training. This will ensure that the Ministry of Defence benefits from efficiency, certainty of costs and reasonable stability to
medium-term planning in national industry.

**279. In the past, most maintenance activities and technical management of the armed**
forces were run mainly by military authorities. Today, many of these activities are still
managed by the Defence, with some others being managed by manufacturers, or those
firms that are specialized in certain services. In future, the number of systems and the
growing complexity of the technologies used, will require a balance between the new
skills to be maintained in the armed forces and those to be managed by the relevant
industries.

**280. To this end, the solutions to be analysed regard: the management of some tech-**
nical activities of by the Defence to be relayed to companies or private companies,
the creation of public-private partnerships, and the use and development of new or
existing administration bodies. In this process, research will be done on the possibility


-----

of industry absorbing some of the technical-industrial structures of Defence and its
personnel, according to specific regulations. Such a change would be subject to the
need of maintaining an efficient and competitive industrial sector and not to compromise the priority needs of national security, all with the objective of strengthening
the logistics of adherence and support to the armed forces front lines. This framework
shall require better definition of the status of personnel of those companies used in
theatre for better logistic support of the equipment used, and to promote the use by
businesses operating in the area of Security and Defence of military personnel who
have left active duty.

**281. Specific priorities for the development of future capabilities and, consequently,**
indications to industry of areas of priority interest, can only be provided as part of
the Strategic Defence Review, and an accurate survey of the areas of excellence held.
Here, however, it is appropriate to provide some principles of reference and general
guidelines to what has already emerged.

**282. Firstly, for the development of future projects, it is appropriate that platforms and**
open and possibly modular architectural systems are used to allow long term autonomous and cost-effective management, ensuring maintenance over time and necessary
updating, according to technological advancement, in simpler and more economical
ways.

**283. The promotion and acquisition of systems and platforms with dual-use techno-**
logies will also be important. The adoption of common requirements and “hybrid
regulations” for products, equipment and components with both civilian and military
applications, allowing advantages to be taken of “economies of scale” in development,
production and in-service platform support will be necessary whenever possible. Given the difference in the life cycles of military platforms (usually very long) compared
to civilian ones, planning during the design and programming stages for the constant
updating of service platforms in order to achieve optimal cost-effectiveness and operability will be necessary. For these reasons, it is important to take the opportunity to
include, as part of the drafting of purchase contracts (besides logistical support and


-----

initial training), also provision for regular updates thereby transforming the nature and
content of the relationship between industry and administration from mere supply to
that of strategic partnership.

**284. For long-term acquisitions of new equipment, a “spiral development acquisition**
process” shall be preferred, that is, a mode of development of systems that provides
for subsequent cycles of: the study of solutions, testing, implementation, deployment,
operational use and evaluation of results, and subsequent progressive adaptation. This
setting will allow for better adjustment of technical solutions to operational problems,
and better control of costs and updating needs in order to meet technological growth
of the sector, as well as operational needs.

Management of development and acquisition programmes

**285. The possibility that the “national system” can be characterized even in the field**
of Defence and Security as a competitive system able to facilitate the development of
knowledge and skills with international success requires the development of different
interaction modes between its many parts. In the definition of requirements, the “Anticipation capability” is to continue to be exercised in line with scenarios and commitments arising from NATO Integrated Defence policies, by CSDP initiatives, and
within the framework of the United Nations. Whenever possible and consistent with
the needs and timing of the Italian Defence, the reconciliation of NATO, CSDP and
national requirements, and interoperability in areas of military cooperation between
allies, collaboration and access to foreign markets will be favoured.

**286. With regard to aspects of inter-ministerial coordination, the possibility of a wider**
use of the technologies to be developed, the need to reduce costs, the objectives of
greater international collaboration and the acquisition of a share of the international
market, creates the need to avoid requirements tailored for the specific needs of the
national Military. In Europe, the adoption of common regulations will simplify the
certification of products and facilitate their transfer within EU Member States. In or

-----

der for Italian industry to compete on an equal footing with major European nations,
the current legal delays when dealing with other countries in the area of regulations
and procedures for the development, acquisition, support, and updating of military
equipment and, in particular, of the main systems will need adjustment.

**287. In the area of equipment acquisition, along with indispensable long-term strategic**
planning, the priority task of the Defence is to ensure the definition of precise requirements, to ensure that the knowledge and operational experience gained are exploited
in the process of definition and development of the means and systems required, and
that innovation and experimentation capability may be involved in the definition of
solutions from initial stages of projects.

**288. As a direct consequence, and in order to raise the level of expertise and compe-**
tence in areas of priority interest, civilian and military personnel employed by Sectors
devoted to acquisition processes must be characterized by high professionalism and
unique specification, developed along precise training paths and through longer terms
spent in key positions.

Defence, industry and university

**289. The Security and Defence Sector favours growth and technological development**
for the nation. Preserving and strengthening the sector not only provides the capability
to improve frames of Security and National Defence, but also allows the creation of new
job opportunities and development in many fields of public utility. The basic technologies required, in fact, benefit a wider audience and represent an enabler in many fields
far from the Security and Defence dimension. The possibility for this industry to find its
proper development dimension lies in the national capability to favour continuation of
close cooperation between Defence, industry, academia, and research. It is in this context that innovation finds its most fertile soil and it is here that future policies should be
implemented for the structural strengthening of the sector, support for the development,
and the creation of vital links between design, implementation and use.


-----

**290. The creation of a continuous cycle between the translation of the idea in specific**
technologies and products and the end user will produce a “national system” capability
to be internationally competitive, to ensure employment and industrial development,
and to renew processes and products for the benefit of the entire community. Therefore, the hoped-for better interaction between Defence and industry will be extended
also to the way that the university system will have to be put in a position to interact
directly and closely with the centres of experimentation and research, both military
and industry. Innovative ideas and research proposals will have to find a quick and
direct channel for their evaluation and promotion and those considered most useful
will have to find funding and support for implementation. The focus of Defence on
research will be towards the ideas and projects aimed at the implementation of innovative technological solutions rather than evolutionary.

**291. The Centres of excellence (CoE), especially in NATO and European circles, are**
initiatives that the nation should consider as priorities, preserving and enhancing the
present and the future to strengthen the operational and/or the technological excellence of the nation. Better links between Centres of Excellence, universities and industry
will promote not only their growth in terms of relevance and ability, but the extension
of opportunities for researchers and new areas of study, favouring the launch of innovative entrepreneurship and the strengthening of industrial structures.

**292. Continuity and visibility in terms of the availability of resources and better in-**
teraction at the national level between all relevant spheres shall allow benefits to be
obtained in terms of planning and programming. A new approach is required in order
to attract resources and capital from the financial market, to be used for the competitive growth of the sector and in particular to strengthen Small and Medium Enterprises
(SMEs) financially, which make up the national chain of subcontractors. The increase
of public and private funds and their better governance will facilitate the strengthening of SMEs, through university spin-offs. In general an important contribution could
come from the identification of a share of R & D to be reserved for SMEs in order to
allow competition among companies of similar size.

**Strategic planning and implementation of the**
**White Paper**


**293. With this White Paper, the Government has started a major transformation of the**
Defence to enable it, in the present climate of limited economic resources, to guarantee
the nation sufficient capabilities to defend national interests, contributing responsibly
to international security.

**294. The first and most urgent measures have already been adopted. This White Paper**
now provides an overall picture of the reforms to be implemented in the near future
presenting them in a single form, as a measure of transparency for parliament and
the general public. The White Paper is a “ministerial directive” for all bodies of the
Administration of Defence, and therefore, the objectives stated therein, when decreed
in keeping with current legislation, should be pursued immediately. As will be fully
explained further on, in several areas in which the White Paper introduces and adopts
concepts, measures and innovative procedures, it should be completed through rese

-----

arch conducted first by the Defence and then by a committee of high-level technical
and legal emissaries, composed of high profile experts. This structure, comparing current military regulations gathered in the Code referred to in Legislative Decree no. 66
of 2010, including amendments, can decide and formulate the legal regulations for
amendment and/or supplement or completely rewrite (according to indications formulated by parliament). It will formalize also for the more complex and more articulated
issues, the criteria to place (by appropriate legislative powers) before the government.

**295. Renewed commitment to the achievement of high levels of effectiveness in the**
protection of national interests and the efficient use of resources available in each
area of the Ministry of Defence, military and civilian, will be required. The lines of
action through which the process of transformation of the Defence and the Military
is developed are four, namely: a review of governance; an adjustment of the “operative model”, understood as quantitative, qualitative and capability forces; personnel
policy; science, industrial and technological innovation policies of the Defence. For
each of these areas, specific areas of Defence will have the primary responsibility to
implement reform measures.

**296. Regarding Review of governance:**

-  within three months, a committee will prepare solutions to implement fully the provisions of the law regarding the powers of the Minister of Defence, also by sending
back to the offices of directly involved, the tasks and functions that had been delegated
to other areas of the administration, and reallocating towards support structures or
administrative bodies all activities not directly involved;

-  within six months, based on the guidelines contained in the White Paper and under
the supervision of the Minister of Defence, the Chief of Defence Staff will prepare, for
the evaluation of the Minister, a new organizational structure of the Military, inclusive
of regulatory measures necessary for its implementation;

-  in analogy with what has been done in the past for the introduction of the “Code of the
Military” (COM) and the “Consolidation Act regulations concerning Military Order”
(TUOM), a committee of experts will prepare within one year and for the approval of
the Minister of Defence, and other Ministers concerned and for the subsequent exami

-----

nation of parliament, a comprehensive review of the existing laws and regulations, in
order to renew, simplify, and adapt them to the new requirements;

-  the government will prepare new regulations aimed at overcoming the existing tripartite division between personnel costs, operation and investment;

**297. Regarding Adjustment of the Operational Model:**

-  within six months, based on the areas contained in the White Paper and under the
supervision of the Minister of Defence, the Chief of Defence Staff will prepare, for
the approval of the Minister, a Strategic Defence Review, which will set out the Force
structure, including future Reserves, the levels of skill, preparation and readiness of
the Armed Forces, with an indication of the necessary human, material and financial
needs. Resulting from the Strategic Defence Review, there will be developed a new
planning cycle, consistent with that worked out in Europe and the Atlantic Alliance,
for the construction, by technical-operational bodies, of a fifteen-year document of
general planning;

-  the government will then prepare the armed forces’ long-term investment laws for
the consideration of parliament.

**298. Regarding Personnel Policy, within six months, on the basis of the issues con-**
tained in the White Paper and under the supervision of the Ministry of Defence, the
Chief of Defence Staff and the General Secretary of the Defence, regarding respective
salary entitlements, will provide new guidelines for new regulations on:

_- selection, promotion and duties of military and civilian leadership;_

_- adjustment and modification of the principle of so-called “standardised promotion_
_processes”;_

_- recruitment and active duty service requirement of civilian and military personnel;_

_- setting up of Reserve Force;_

_- management of so-called “transitory regime”._

**299. Regarding science, industrial and technological innovation policies of the Defence:**

-  within six months, based on the issues contained in the White Paper and under the
supervision of the Minister of Defence, the Secretary General of Defence/the Natio

-----

nal Armaments Director will prepare, for the approval of the Defence Minister and
other Ministers concerned, an Industry and Technology (SIT) Strategy with which to
implement a new strategy of wide-ranging cooperation between the Defence, industry
and academia and research units. Under SIT there will be defined long-term goals,
specific skills, modes of interaction and development of initiatives, both in order to
ensure greater compliance of the “national system” to the needs of future Security and
Defence, and to facilitate international competitiveness, scientific and technological
development and employment prospects.

**300. In parallel with the four areas of Defence transformation described above, and in**
compliance with the objectives of this White Paper, specific ministerial directives will
outline government policies for the redefinition of tasks, the priorities for action and
the general operation of the Ministry of Defence.


-----

**Afterword**

_The drafting of the White Paper for International Security and Defence was decided_
_by the Supreme Defence Council during its 19 March 2014 meeting. The definition of_
_the White Paper’s Guidelines, to be completed by June 2014, was identified as the_
_first step of the process, and entrusted to a group of experts that would work under the_
_guidance of the Ministry of Defence, with the cooperation of the Ministry of Foreign_
_Affairs and International Cooperation._
_In order to broaden the reflection on defence themes the Ministry of Defence promoted_
_a Meeting on National Security and Defence that took place on 5-6 June, attended_
_by top Italian international studies experts. The Guidelines were submitted to the_
_Supreme Defence Council on 18 June, and later published on the Defence internet_
_site, thus opening a public debate on their content._
_Over the months of September and October 2014 the Ministry of Defence organized_
_various meetings with experts from the different sectors involved in the Defence Sy-_
_stem (universities and the scientific and technological community, companies, pacifist_
_movements and NGOs). In the meantime consultations were held also with experts_
_from major European countries and the U.S.._
_Subsequently, after various meetings with top officials of the Ministry of Defence, the_
_experts from the Cabinet of the Minister started the actual drafting of the document,_
_under the direct responsibility of the Defence Minister. Finally, the Paper was discus-_
_sed with the Chief od Defence Staff and submitted to the Prime Minister._
_At the end of the process, the White Book for International Security and Defence was_
_illustrated to the Supreme Defence Council on 21 April 2015, and later submitted to_
_the Parliament and published on the Defence internet site. The House of Represen-_
_tatives and Senate Foreign Affairs and Defence Committees held a discussion on its_
_content on 14 May and 4 June 2015._
