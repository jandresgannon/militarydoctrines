## Organisation of the management of the Danish defence and addition
 to Defence Agreement 2013-2017

A reorganisation of the senior management will contribute to the further efficiency improvement

of the Danish defence according to the political Defence Agreement 2013-2017.

At the same time, this will provide an opportunity for simplifying the current organisation and

reducing the number of levels and authorities within the Danish defence.

An organisational change will also provide an opportunity for adjusting the organisation of the

management of the Danish defence to meet future requirements in relation to a co-ordinated

and efficient use of resources and handling of tasks.

In connection with the amendment of the Danish Defence Act, the government indicated its

willingness to discuss a specific proposal for an organisational change of the management of the

Danish defence with the parties of the ‘Folketing’ (Danish parliament), as the current defence

agreement states that the area of the joint forces within the Danish defence is to be

strengthened.

In relation to the authority contained within the Danish Defence Act, stating that the minister of

defence may administratively determine the more detailed organisation of the management of

the Danish defence, the parties to the agreement note that it is the government’s responsibility

to determine the more detailed organisation and limitation of the department of the Ministry of

Defence. Also, the parties to the agreement note that the overall structural organisation of the

Danish defence is bound by conditions stipulated in the agreement.

On the basis of this, and after discussions between the government (the Social Democrats and

the Social-Liberal Party), the Liberal Party (‘Venstre’), The Socialist People’s Party, the Danish

People’s Party, the Liberal Alliance and the Conservatives, in addition to the political Defence

Agreement 2013-2017, the following has been agreed on:

There is a consensus to change the organisation of the management of the Danish defence in

order to significantly simplify the structure, and to achieve a further efficiency improvement.

The operational parts of Defence Command Denmark will be merged with the three operational

commands into a new joint services military command (The Joint Defence Command) under the


-----

management of the chief of defence. The chief of defence remains the senior military advisor to

the minister of defence.

The chief of defence will be placed together with part of his staff (expected up to abt. 125 full
time employees) at the department of the Ministry of Defence. The majority of the remaining

part of the Joint Defence Command will be placed in Karup.

The Joint Defence Command is to be organised in such a manner that the joint services area will

be strengthened without weakening the professional environments and identities of the special

services.

The Arctic Command and the Special Operations Command will enter as authorities into the Joint

Defence Command, referring directly to the chief of defence, but with the necessary

independent profile and structure defined by the nature of the assignments and the

geographical locations of the commands. This is done with a view to the chief of defence

ensuring an increased focus on the Arctic and the special operations forces with regard to

planning and force production, thus also ensuring the necessary support. In accordance with the

political Defence Agreement 2013-2017, the parties to the agreement find it of vital importance

that these areas should be prioritized. The Arctic Command will remain in Nuuk. The Special

Operations Command will be placed in Aalborg.

Overall planning, resource allocation, and fiscal management will be integrated and joined at the

department of the Ministry of Defence. Personnel strategy will also be placed at the department.

The chief of defence will be in charge of the military consultancy, which will form the basis of

the overall planning and resource management, including of the support services. The chief of

defence will thus be able to influence decisions regarding investments in and maintenance of

equipment. The chief of defence will be in charge of the maintenance of the equipment of the

defence, cf. below. The chief of defence will be responsible for the budget pertaining to the

operational area.

In connection with the establishment of the Joint Defence Command as a new independent

authority, which in part will be placed together with the department of the Ministry of Defence,

the ‘Folketing’ and the public are ensured the same access to the military recommendations and

assessments of the chief of defence, as has been the case so far.


-----

The role and responsibility of the chief of defence with regard to the equipment area and in

relation to fiscal management, etc., are described in more detail in appendix 1 and 2,

respectively.

Appendix 3 shows the new overall structure for the organisation of the Ministry of Defence.

Appendix 4 is a tentative rendition of the Joint Defence Command, as the chief of defence will

determine its organisation in more detail within the framework of this agreement.

An annual yield of DKK 170 million is to be achieved by the full implementation of the

reorganised management of the Danish defence, which will contribute to securing the fiscal

aspect of the political Defence Agreement 2013-2017.

The Defence Health Service will be assigned to the Joint Defence Command and will be moved

from Skalstrup to Aarhus. The Aviation Medical Clinic is expected to be moved to Skrydstrup.

Skalstrup will be sold.

The maritime surveillance centres will be joined in Frederikshavn.

The parties to the agreement concur that the number of defence workplaces in Bornholm should

be maintained despite the closing of the Maritime Surveillance Centre in Bornholm. The defence

is tasked with drafting a model for this. The model will be presented to the parties to the

agreement in the middle of 2014, at the latest.

The military units, staffs, and schools, incl. the Defence Academy, of the defence are to be

assigned to the Joint Defence Command.

The equipment area will be reorganised with a view to strengthening the strategic control, and

supporting the operational and military responsibility of the chief of defence.

The Danish Defence Acquisition and Logistics Organization (DALO) will thus become an

independent agency under the Ministry of Defence (the Ministry of Defence Equipment and

Procurement Agency).

With the general purpose of strengthening the overall management of the equipment area and

ensuring a strong supervision with this new agency, the department will be allocated further

resources.

In this connection, the department will also handle the overall management of the project

organisations being set up in connection with major and/or strategic defence equipment


-----

projects/procurements, cf. appendix 5, with a view to in this manner establish the best possible

foundation for the inclusion of the relevant parties to the agreement.

The management of Danish Defence Supply will be moved from Ballerup to Aarhus. A timetable

for this will be presented to the parties to the agreement in the middle of 2014.

The Danish Maintenance Agencies, which at present form part of the Danish Defence

Acquisition and Logistics Organization, will be merged with the maintenance structure of the

services in a new maintenance organisation under the Joint Defence Command. The

management of the new maintenance organisation will be placed in Aarhus.

An analysis will be carried out of the implementation of the merger. The ongoing work on

further optimization and efficiency improvements of the overall maintenance area will be

continued. It will be the guiding force behind the proposal for a more detailed organisation

which is to result from the analysis. The analysis will be presented to the parties to the

agreement in the middle of 2014, at the latest.

The other functional services will be joined and thus reduced in number, as stipulated in the

political Defence Agreement 2013-2017. In the future, they will be independent agencies under

the department of the Ministry of Defence.

This entails the merger of the Danish Defence Informatics Service and the future Equipment and

Procurement Agency under the department of the Ministry of Defence.

The Danish Defence Personnel Service, the Danish Defence Centre for Working Environment,

and the Veteran Centre will be joined with the Ministry of Defence Personnel Agency, though the

Veteran Centre will remain in Ringsted.

With respect to the development of the task performance of the Danish Defence Building and

Establishment Service relating to the operation of establishments, the largest possible part of the

management will be joined in Hjørring.

The parties to the agreement note that it is a prerequisite for this that a further annual yield of

DKK 30 million can be obtained by making driving schools, the Navy's technical courses, and

guard services subject to competition. In addition to this, the marine environment surveillance

will also be made subject to competition. The parties to the agreement agree to set up an

objective for a further annual yield of DKK 46 million by the complete phase-in of the following

areas being made subject to competition:

-  The workshop area, as the realization of assets should form part of the considerations


-----

-  The informatics area, as the sale of this enterprise should be considered, too

-  Further parts of the building and establishment area

-  Certain tasks within the personnel area

-  Certain tasks within the accounting area.

The Home Guard Command will be placed in Vordingborg.

DKK 25 million is allocated annually with the purpose of strengthening the effort with regard to

the veterans.

Furthermore, the parties to the agreement concur to accede to the plan drafted by the Danish

defence for covering the identified remaining requirement for financing in connection with the

implementation of the agreement. See appendix 6.

The expected effects on the number of senior military positions within the management of the

Danish defence can be seen in appendix 7.

An analysis concerning the Danish Defence Judge Advocate Corps is being conducted. See

appendix 8.

**Appendix 1**

**The role and responsibilities of the chief of defence in relation to equipment**
**planning**

The chief of defence is responsible for and approves the so-called priority directive in the
equipment area, prioritizing replacement procurement and procurement of new capacities.
The directive is drafted on the basis of the political defence agreements and – for subsequent
years – the development activities of the defence.

The chief of defence also approves the more detailed planning of procurement and operation
of equipment on the basis of the priority directive.

The chief of defence is responsible for the military requirements for new equipment and,
therefore, influences decisions concerning equipment procurement.

The chief of defence is responsible for the performance of equipment maintenance in the
Danish defence.


-----

**Appendix 2**

**The role and responsibilities of the chief of defence in relation to financial**
**management, etc.**

The chief of defence is responsible for the budget for the Joint Defence Command with
assigned authorities, units, staffs, schools, etc. (including production and troop deployment).

The staff support of the joint services and the special services, needed to formulate military
advice, must be available to the chief of defence. This advice will be the basis of the overall
planning and fiscal management, including the support production, among other things. In
addition to this is the staff support in the fiscal area, necessary to the handling of the budget
responsibility.

Due to his function as senior military advisor, the chief of defence will be included and thus
have a direct influence on the part of the support function, on which the operational area
relies. The military advice of the chief of defence will, therefore, be an important factor in the
planning and resource allocation for the support function of, among other things, the deployed
forces of the Danish defence, as well as the coordination of plans and their subsequent
implementation in the operational area and the support function.

The overall planning and resource allocation will be carried out at the department within the
framework of the political defence agreements and their implementation in the finance act,
etc. On the basis of this, the department will work out a draft for the more detailed planning
in the form of a multi-annual budget and plan/yearly programme, as well as the annual result
contracts, negotiated and entered into with the heads of the agencies of the organisation,
including the chief of defence.

Aided by his staff, the chief of defence will convert his fiscal framework into action
programmes which will be indicative for the assigned units, staffs, and schools.

Consequently, the chief of defence will be responsible for the overall budget of the Joint
Defence Command and its task solution. In this connection, he will need to ensure that the
pertaining authorities, units, staffs, schools, etc., will solve the tasks assigned to them within
the resource framework, and that they will contribute continuously to streamlining the task
performance and the use of resources.

**Appendix 5**

**Strategic equipment projects**

Strategic equipment projects can be both replacement procurement and new procurement.

This will typically be projects whose scope (in relation to the overall capacities and/or finances
of the Danish defence), risk, or other significance is of such a nature that there is reason to
ensure close management and connection to the political level, including to ensure the
relevant involvement of the parties to the agreement.

Among other things, the department of the Ministry of Defence will ensure its control by
handling the chairmanship of the steering committees for the project organisations in
question. A separate organisation may also be established, as is currently the case with the
programme “Nyt Kampfly” (‘New Fighter Jet’) which is a part of the department. This will be
based on a specific assessment in each case.

The parties to the agreement will be continuously informed about which project organisations
are being established in connection with strategic equipment projects.

**Appendix 7**

**Expected effects on the number of military senior positions in the management of**
**the Danish defence**

It is expected that the senior management will include abt. 9 general’s positions compared to
14 in the current structure (including the chief of the future Special Operations Command).

This is the equivalent of a reduction in the number of positions at general’s level of abt. 35
p.c.

The number of other military positions in the management of the Danish defence will also be
reduced, as it is expected that the reduction of military senior positions will be higher
percentage-wise than the reduction of other military positions. The objective, therefore, is to
reduce the military senior positions by abt. 30 p.c., while the reduction of other military
positions is expected to be between 15 and 20 p.c.

The final determination of the number will depend on the final organisation, just as the
grading of the wage level of each position will need to be settled with the organisation entitled
to negotiate this matter.

**Appendix 8**

**The Danish Defence Judge Advocate Corps**

The military’s prosecuting authority, the Danish Defence Judge Advocate Corps, consists of
two authorities where the judge advocates are the equivalent of the public prosecutors and
the police commissioners, and the judge advocate general is the equivalent of the public
prosecutor. In co-operation with the Ministry of Justice, the Ministry of Defence will carry out
an analysis of the options for strengthening independence regarding the processing of military
criminal cases, including through a transfer of tasks to the civil prosecution. The analysis is to
describe the derived consequences of this, including, among other things, organisational,
employment-related, legislative, and financial consequences. Furthermore, the analysis is to
assess the future geographical location of the Danish Defence Judge Advocate Corps.

The analysis will be presented to the parties to the agreement in June 2014 for a political
decision.
