## INTRODUCTION

The international environment is characterised by constant change. Change in
the position and relative influence of various states, the role and influence of
international institutions and non-state actors, and change in what constitutes
internationally acceptable behaviour. It is an environment that is shaped by
action and reaction, dialogue and dispute, coercion and cooperation.

It is therefore important that all elements of national strategy are examined
regularly and systematically.

In order to effectively set a nation’s defence policy priorities, the contemporary
strategic environment and the shape it may take in the future must be well
understood. This in turn underpins decisions on the appropriate mix of military
capabilities and relationships needed to advance national security interests.

This document provides an assessment of the strategic environment out to
2040 and will inform the development of a new Defence White Paper 2015.

## 1. TRENDS AND FACTORS INFLUENCING CONFLICT AND COOPERATION

In order to effectively set a nation’s defence policy priorities, the contemporary
strategic environment and the shape it may take in the future must be well
understood. This in turn underpins decisions on the appropriate mix of military
capabilities and relationships needed to advance national security interests.

This Chapter is divided into three sections. Section one details major trends in
the characteristics of contemporary conflict. Section two assesses the key
themes that are broadly encouraging or deterring future conflict. Section three
then assesses a number of evolving, thematic areas that are likely to affect
future conflicts. The following Chapter rounds out this analysis, expanding on
the observations made in the previous three sections through a geographic
lens. All sections seek to place identified trends within short, medium or long term contexts.

### 1.1. CONFLICT TRENDS 

**CHARACTER OF CONFLICT**

1. Conflict is traditionally divided into two types: between states (inter-state) and within
states (intra-state) and is understood to exist across a spectrum of intensity.[1] Generally,
inter-state conflict has tended to be characterised by high intensity combat between
conventional military forces operating according to the Laws of Armed Conflict.[2] Intra-state
conflict has generally been distinguished by lower intensities, and non-conventional
military tactics (such as the use of improvised explosive devices) used by non-state groups
which seek out new, innovative and asymmetric ways of fighting larger, more powerful
armed forces. These groups make use of civilian populations and may disregard the
restrictions and norms of international law.

1 Intensity of conflict (high, medium, low) refers to the overall tempo, degree of violence and technological
sophistication of the violence employed and/or encountered. The rate of consumption of resources can also
be a measure of intensity. The intensity of a conflict is high when the violence is continuous or when the
encounters between combatants are particularly violent; medium when violence is frequent; and low when
violence is occasional.
2 The Law of Armed Conflict comprises a set of rules, established by treaty or custom, that seek to protect
persons and property/objects that are (or may be) affected by armed conflict and limits the rights of parties to
a conflict to use methods and means of warfare of their choice.

DEFENCE ASSESSMENT 2014 3


-----

**Figure 1-1: Types and Numbers of Conflict**

2. The distinction between inter-state and intra-state warfare is important when
considering the likelihood of conflict at the very high end of the spectrum (i.e. major interstate war). Outside of this low likelihood scenario however the distinction between inter
and intra-state conflict has less relevance than it once did in terms of the potential threat
environment that armed forces are operating in. Some intra-state conflicts exhibit high
threat, high intensity environments with well-armed and organised adversary forces.

**NUMBERS OF CONFLICTS HOLDING STEADY**

3. The number of active conflicts over the past decade has remained relatively static,
between 31 and 38 (see Figure 1-1 above). In 2012, 31 of 32 active conflicts were within
states. They ranged from reasonably isolated conflicts with low numbers of fatalities (e.g.
the Baloch insurgency in Pakistan) to mid intensity conflict between multiple state and nonstate actors with substantial military capabilities such as in South Sudan or Libya. Although
the risk of inter-state conflict remains low, it is rising primarily due to tensions between
major actors in the Asia-Pacific (discussed further on page 40).

**RISING EXTERNAL INVOLVEMENT**

4. Perhaps more important than the number of armed conflicts is the nature of the active
participants. In the last five years there has been a significant increase in the number of
active intra-state conflicts with external troop involvement. The current conflicts in Syria
and Iraq are good examples. These conflicts are more likely to be sustained because of
external support, and the wider region is also more likely to be negatively affected. Such
conflicts are also associated with much higher death rates. The number of deaths resulting
from intra-state conflicts with external involvement has been rising steadily since 2005.

5. As a trend, the involvement of external actors in intra-state conflicts is projected to
continue, although without a high confidence level given the myriad factors in play. It will

DEFENCE ASSESSMENT 2014 4


-----

be determined in part by how aggressively certain countries seek to re-establish traditional
spheres of influence, and the continuing inability of many states to retain control of all of
their territory.

6. The number and diversity of participating non-state or semi-state (such as
government-backed militias) actors is increasing. The conflicts in Syria, Iraq and Ukraine
appear to involve state-backed militia either as reinforcement to conventional forces, or as
a method of employing force with deniability. Their success in doing so is likely to
encourage other states to utilise this tactic in the future. Should this trend continue it will
have negative implications for international security as conflicts are sustained and it
becomes more difficult to attribute military actions to specific national forces including in
the event of human rights abuses.

7. Should New Zealand choose to involve itself in such conflicts in the future, an
increasingly congested operating environment – with state, semi-state and non-state actor
involvement – will complicate Defence Force actions from intelligence, planning, legal and
operating perspectives. Threat levels in peace support operations, such as the deployment
of our Provincial Reconstruction Team to Bamyan in Afghanistan, could be similar to more
traditional, higher threat combat operations.

**UNITED NATIONS PEACE SUPPORT OPERATIONS: INCREASING THREATS AND**
**COMPLICATIONS**

8. The number of United Nations peace support operations and personnel fielded has
remained reasonably stable over the past five years. As at 30 September 2014, there were
17 missions in operation with approximately 120,000 personnel (see Figure 1-2 for names
and whereabouts of each mission).[3] Approximately 80% of all currently deployed
United Nations personnel are in Sub-Saharan Africa and 60% of all current United Nations
missions are located there. With conflict levels overall remaining relatively constant, it is
likely that there will continue to be at least one new mission established each year, as well
as one disestablished.

9. Although numbers have remained stable, the nature of United Nations operations has
continued to evolve. The majority of new missions[4] since 2010 have been deployed into
intra-state conflicts, with on-going violence between actors, significant external
involvement in the conflict, and with more robust United Nations mandates relating to the
use of force and the protection of civilians. United Nations troops and United Nations
civilians are increasingly becoming targets themselves, raising the risk of the
United Nations troop contributing countries taking casualties.

10. United Nations missions are at times being preceded by operations conducted under
United Nations mandate by “coalitions of the willing” often made up of advanced
developed country forces, such as the United Nations mission in Mali. There are also more
“hybrid” missions being conducted where a regional body, such as the African Union,
conducts the mission jointly with the United Nations as in Darfur, Sudan. The majority of
personnel on “hybrid” and United Nations missions continue to be sourced from
developing nations in South Asia and Africa.

11. Undertaking more robust, multidimensional mandates in higher threat environments is
driving a shift towards incorporating the kind of advanced military capabilities and
equipment normally fielded in traditional combat operations, such as armoured vehicles,
remotely piloted systems and helicopter gunships. There is also an on-going shortage of
military “enablers” in many missions, such as aerial intelligence, planning, reconnaissance
and surveillance, and air transport capabilities. The United Nations is conducting a “once
in 15 year” review of all aspects of United Nations peace support over 2015. Any
recommendations that flow from the United Nations’ report will be carefully assessed for
their implications for New Zealand’s national interests and the Defence Force’s ability to
conduct its roles and tasks.

4 New missions since the last defence assessment include a larger, more robust UN mission in the
Democratic Republic of Congo, a UN mission in Abyei (the province disputed between Sudan and South
Sudan), and United Nations missions in South Sudan, Mali and the Central African Republic.

### 1.2. CONFLICT TRENDS CONCLUSIONS 


**Character of conflict**

The distinction between inter and intra-state
conflict has less relevance than it once did. Some
intra-state conflicts exhibit high threat, high
intensity environments with well-armed and
organised adversary forces.

Although the risk of inter-state conflict remains
low, it is rising primarily due to tensions between
major actors in the Asia-Pacific.


**Conflict numbers holding steady**

The number of active conflicts has remained
relatively steady over the past decade, between
31 and 38.

In 2012, 31 of 32 active conflicts were within
states.


**Rising external involvement**

In the last five years there has been a significant
increase in the number of active intra-state
conflicts with external troop involvement.

These conflicts are more likely to be sustained
because of external support, and the wider region
is also more likely to be negatively affected. Such
conflicts are also associated with much higher
death rates. The number of deaths resulting from
intra-state conflicts with external involvement has
been rising steadily since 2005.


**Rising external involvement cont**

The number and diversity of participating nonstate or semi-state actors is increasing. In all
likelihood the conflicts in Syria, Iraq and Ukraine
involve state-backed militia either as

reinforcement to conventional forces, or as a
method of employing force with deniability.
Should this trend continue it will have negative
implications for international security as it
becomes more difficult to attribute military actions
to specific national forces.


**Nature of new operations**


The majority of new United Nations missions
since 2010 have been deployed into intra-state
conflicts, with ongoing violence between actors
and more robust United Nations mandates
relating to the use of force and the protection of
civilians. United Nations troops and

United Nations civilians are increasingly

becoming targets themselves, raising the risk of
the troop contributing countries taking casualties.

Should New Zealand choose to involve itself in
such conflicts in the future, threat levels in peace
support operations, such as the deployment of
our Provincial Reconstruction Team to Bamyan in
Afghanistan, could be similar to more traditional
combat operations.

### 1.3. DRIVERS OF CONFLICT AND COOPERATION

12. In any potential conflict there is a unique set of both internal and external drivers at
play that may cause it to erupt, escalate, be sustained, conclude, or be prevented from
occurring in the first place. These drivers can be strongly or weakly inter-related and are
likely to change over time. It is therefore challenging to accurately predict where and when
the next conflict will occur, its duration, and its consequences.

13. Nevertheless, the presence of such drivers can provide an indication of a state or
region’s susceptibility to tension or conflict. They can be broadly grouped into
environmental, demographic, economic, political, military, and technological categories.
More generally, the state of the global political system itself can play a role in increasing or
reducing the likelihood of conflict.

**1.3.1. EASTWARD SHIFT IN GLOBAL POWER**

14. Over the past five years the trend of global power shifting from West to East has
continued apace, helped in part by the Global Financial Crisis disproportionately affecting
developed nations.[5] By 2030 Asia is expected to have surpassed North America and
Europe combined in terms of global power based on gross domestic product, population
size, military spending and technological investment (see Figures 1-3, 1-4, and 1-5 over
page). The Goldman Sachs “next eleven”, which includes South Korea, Philippines,
Vietnam, and Indonesia, is expected to overtake the European Union in global power by
2030.[6] Although these countries are not expected to act as a bloc, it demonstrates that the
continued shift of global power away from the West is not restricted to India and China.

5 National Power describes the aggregate of all elements that is available to a nation in pursuit of national
objectives. While difficult to separate into discrete groups, it is useful to apply some form of classification to
aid understanding. They include geography; population; natural resources; economic, political and military
power; and psychological and informational factors (commonly referred to as soft power).
6 The “next eleven” was coined by Goldman Sachs in 2007 and refers to the eleven emerging economies in
additional to the so-called “BRICS” which consist of Brazil, Russia, India, China and South Africa. The full list
is Bangladesh, Egypt, Indonesia, Iran, Pakistan, Mexico, Nigeria, the Philippines, South Korea, Turkey and
Vietnam.

**1.3.2. RISING RISK OF MAJOR CONFLICT**

15. Although the risk of conflict is heightened during the shift of economic, military, political
and soft power, it is not inevitable. Multiple powers – including China, India, Brazil, and
Indonesia – are rising at the same time, though at different speeds.

16. There are a number of factors moderating the risk of major conflict that have not been
present during previous shifts in the global balance of power. The world is more
interconnected economically than it has ever been before, encouraging a shared interest
in a prosperous and stable economic environment; there is a strong, documented memory
of past conflicts and their catastrophic impacts; public opinion to varying degrees in both
democratic and non-democratic states, and their ubiquitous access to immediate
information from across the globe, places limits on decision-makers’ ability to use force;
and global norms and international diplomatic mechanisms encouraging the prevention or
de-escalation of conflict have strengthened since the end of the Cold War.

**1.3.3. INCREASING CHALLENGES TO STATE BORDERS**

17. Since the end of World War Two and the establishment of the United Nations, state
borders have been largely frozen across much of the world (a notable exception being the
decolonisation process across Africa and Asia and the break up of Yugoslavia). Many of
the borders drawn up by former colonial powers did not necessarily reflect traditional
cultural, ethnic or sectarian boundaries and in the past five years they have come under
increasing challenge across a number of regions, most especially in the Middle East.

18. When a group seeks to forge a new state out of two or more other states, this presents
a particular challenge to international peace and security. Recent examples include
Basque separatists in Spain and France, and Kurdish guerrillas in south eastern Turkey
and northern Iraq. Groups seeking to leave one country and join another, such as in the
current conflict in Ukraine, also present significant challenges which the international

DEFENCE ASSESSMENT 2014 10


-----

system is not well placed to address. Should these trends continue it will have a
substantial negative impact on world security.

**1.3.4. DIFFUSION OF POWER AND INCREASING INFLUENCE OF INFORMAL**
**NETWORKS**

19. Non-state entities, from multinational corporations like Google and British Petroleum to
non-governmental organisations like Greenpeace and Transparency International, are
likely to continue to increase in influence over the coming decades. Communications
technologies are increasing the power of companies that have control over the rich data
sets generated by social media networks and the ubiquitous use of search engines across
the globe.

20. Information technology is also enabling diverse, sometimes geographically distant
groups of state and non-state actors to form in support of a particular issue and then
disperse once the issue is addressed (or interest wanes). Although formal state-based
alliances like the North Atlantic Treaty Organisation will endure, it is likely that these
informal networks will increasingly come together in pursuit of shared goals or policy
objectives. The most prominent example of this is international advocacy in support of
reducing the impacts of human-induced climate change, which has brought together
businesses, non-government organisations, states and international organisations in
pursuit of a common objective.

21. The increasing number of actors involved may at times complicate or slow down the
ability to take collective action. Conversely many states, particularly the less powerful, may
seek to establish or join such groups in order to leverage off the group’s collective power.

**1.3.5. ECONOMIC INTERDEPENDENCE: CONFLICT MODERATOR**

22. The global economy is more interconnected now than at any other time in history.
Technological advances are reducing the costs of communication and transportation, and
trade policies around the world have undergone significant liberalisation over the past 30
years.

23. The performance of major developed states is no longer as important to the health of
the global economy, as Figure 1-6 on the previous page illustrates. The relative
contribution of advanced economies to global growth declined from 70% between 1973
and 1985, to 57% between 1986 and 2007, and then to 6% from 2008-2009 during the
Global Financial Crisis. Although the United States economic recovery and slowdowns in
China and India is likely to reverse this trend, it is unlikely that the West will again
dominate global growth to the degree seen
previously. The West’s economic prosperity

exports to other emerging economies from
46% to 65%. The rest of Asia, excluding India and China, increased from 44% to 60%.

25. The implications for international security are both positive and negative. Historically, a
state had to conquer territory to access its resources. Globalised trade and investment
encourages the purchase of land, resources or products instead. Where this may not apply
is in situations where a resource is particularly scarce or lucrative, such as oil and gas.
Global economic interdependence provides states with an incentive to cooperate, as their
economic wellbeing is tied to the health of the economies with which they trade. Similarly,
it encourages the de-escalation of emergent conflicts before they significantly affect trade
and domestic economies.

26. Interdependence, particularly where there is an imbalance in power or trade, however,
also gives countries the ability to use that imbalance as leverage in a dispute. Most
obviously, this includes the use of United Nations-mandated or unilateral trade sanctions.
Perhaps less obviously, and certainly less openly, it includes a state’s slowing or cutting of
a crucial export. One recent example of this is Russia’s use of “gas diplomacy” during its
conflict with Ukraine. As a tool short of war during times of tension, it is likely that we will
continue to see this occurring in the future.

**1.3.6. RISING RESOURCE SCARCITY EXACERBATED BY CLIMATE CHANGE**

27. Resource scarcity is strongly linked to rising populations, increasing affluence, and
static, low or falling rates of agricultural productivity. The global population is expected to
increase from 7.1 billion today to 8.3 billion by 2030. At the same time the size of the
global middle class, which consumes greater amounts of protein-rich food, water and
energy per capita, is expected to increase from one to two or even three billion.

DEFENCE ASSESSMENT 2014 12


-----

28. The trend towards increasing scarcity is likely to worsen over the next 15 years,
although its effects will be felt unevenly. The demand for energy, food and water is
expected to increase by 50%, 35% and 40% respectively by 2030. The impact of climate
change, although uneven across the globe, is already negatively affecting overall global
food production and water distribution, an effect that will only increase over time given the
continued increase in global greenhouse gas emissions.[7] Such scarcity has the potential
to fuel tension in areas where there are significant untapped natural resources and
improving access, such as the Arctic and Antarctic.


The Himalayan glaciers are the sources of major river systems of the Tibetan Plateau
and supply water to almost 1.5 billion people in Asia. Increased glacier melt could cause
significant disruption to the region’s water security. With regional population expected to
increase to 2.2 billion by 2050, access to safe water will be challenging, particularly
noting the potential decreased supply due to climate changes.

International


**Figure 1-7: Glacial Melt and Future Water Security in the Tibetan Plateau Region**


29. A number of factors may slow or reverse this trend over the longer term, although it is
difficult to assess their likelihood with any confidence. This could include increased
technological transfer of advanced irrigation and agricultural techniques; an agreement to
limit global greenhouse gas emissions to the point that warming does not increase beyond
two degrees centigrade; and the widespread adoption and public acceptance of droughtresistant genetically modified crops.

7 Although some regions at high latitudes, such as Canada, Russia, may see increased agricultural
productivity as temperatures rise, this is expected to be offset by areas that will receive less rainfall, such as
the Middle East and North Africa.

DEFENCE ASSESSMENT 2014 13


-----

30. Resource scarcity and climate change are not likely to cause conflict in and of
themselves but they can aggravate existing tensions within and between fragile states or
regions with existing or historical tensions, such as Egypt and Sudan over the Nile River.
There has also been widespread resentment across Africa, for instance, directed towards
states purchasing land or long-term leases for food security purposes. Limiting access to a
scarce resource could also be used as a tool of war.

31. Conversely, resource scarcity may at times also encourage greater cooperation
between countries with an interest in conserving a shared resource. Historically, waterrelated tensions have led to more water-sharing agreements than violent conflicts.[8]

**1.3.7. DEMOGRAPHY: UNEVEN EFFECTS**

32. Since the 1970s roughly 80% of all conflicts have originated in countries with relatively
young (average age under 25) populations. This is due in part to countries with young
populations having difficulty generating sufficient employment opportunities for the
increasing number of people entering the workforce.

33. Overall, the world’s population is ageing (see Figure 1-8 over page for demographic
projections out to 2040). Between 2010 and 2030 the number and geographic spread of
youthful countries is expected to decline from 80 to 50 countries. This indicates that
youthful demographics will over time become less of a factor influencing where conflict
emerges, as well as potentially the overall number of conflicts. Despite the positive overall
trend, however, Sub-Saharan Africa, and parts of the Middle East, South Asia and the
Pacific, are expected to continue to have growing, youthful populations which will strain
states’ ability to provide sufficient employment to the extent that tension or unrest
continues in these regions.

34. Conversely, many developed and developing countries will soon face, if they do not
already, the effects of declining proportions of working age people relative to the overall
population. Most drastically, in Russia the population has already begun to decline, and is
expected to decline a further 16% by 2050. Japan, along with Germany and other
developed states, is also expected to have a declining population out beyond 2040. Such
countries may face lower or stagnating economic growth rates unless they accept
significant inward migration.

35. The implications of an ageing population on security are less clear. Slower or stagnant
economic growth could contribute to social unrest when combined with other factors, while
a greater proportion of spending on health, aged care and pensions may reduce some
states’ spending on military capabilities. It may also make them more risk averse (due to
their cost) when it comes to discretionary deployments such as peace support operations.

Organisation International Plan of Action.

**1.3.8. RISING ECONOMIC INEQUALITY**

36. The present era of globalisation has produced vast increases in wealth and
productivity. In China alone it is estimated that 500 million people have been lifted out of
poverty since it began liberalising its economy in the late 1970s. The benefits of
globalisation, however, have not been evenly spread within and between countries.
Overall, the difference between the richest and poorest nations in gross domestic product
per capita terms has increased, even while many developing countries have increased
their share of world gross domestic product and grown wealthier in an absolute sense.

37. Perhaps more importantly, inequality within both developed and developing countries
has generally been on an upward trend since the 1980s. In developed, democratic
countries dissatisfaction has manifested in the various anti-capitalist movements and rises
in the popularity of far left and right political parties which reject current economic and
political orthodoxies. The effects of the Global Financial Crisis, such as unemployment and
government bail-outs of financial institutions, have exacerbated this dissatisfaction.

38. In countries with lower levels of economic development, and where certain ethnic, age,
cultural or religious groups are disproportionally affected, or where the state is already
fragile, inequality can lead to a greater probability of conflict. The rapid growth that
globalisation can deliver has the potential to, equally rapidly, intensify or create significant
inequalities if the benefits are not broadly shared. Inequality will continue to be a driver of
conflict in the decades to come unless the benefits of globalisation are more evenly
distributed across societies. It will also encourage higher levels of both legal and illegal
migration, as people seek economic opportunities.

**1.3.9. INCREASING EXTREMISM**

39. Extremism – be it religious, nationalist or ideological – tends to increase during times
of economic dislocation, and can be exacerbated by poor governance, repression or
discrimination against a particular cultural, ethnic or religious group.

40. Extremism helps adherents to unite against an outside enemy and can encourage
them to take collective action in the name of their group against a real or notional “other”.
The strength of group identity – which can transcend loyalty to the state – can be a
deciding factor in whether groups can be mobilised to violence. So long as large segments
of a population remain marginalised, extremist groups will continue to present challenges
to the dominant political order, including though the use of violence.

**1.3.10. WEAPONS OF MASS DESTRUCTION PROLIFERATION: INCREASING RISKS**

41. As diplomatic action over the Syrian regime’s use of chemical weapons demonstrated,
the international norm against the use of chemical, biological radiological or nuclear
weapons of mass destruction remains strong, reducing the likelihood of countries with
existing stockpiles using them. Despite this, the acquisition of weapons of mass
destruction (as opposed to their use) continues to be attractive to certain states with
perceptions of vulnerability, acting as a disincentive to external intervention.

42. The acquisition of weapons of mass destruction by one state has the potential to
generate a cascading effect. Although an outline agreement over Iran’s nuclear capability
was made in April 2015, it remains a possibility that a final, comprehensive agreement will
not be concluded. If Iran declares that it has a nuclear weapons capability (or the ability to

do so at short notice) other countries in the region could seek nuclear weapons of their
own, though their success in doing so would be by no means certain.

43. The proliferation of weapons of mass destruction to a greater number of states, and
potentially terrorist groups (which continue to seek their acquisition), will remain an
important challenge to national and international security given their potential catastrophic
impact. For this reason, it is critical that any use of such weapons results in international
action against the user, alongside continued multilateral efforts to prevent their
proliferation.

**1.3.11. QUICKENING TECHNOLOGY ADOPTION: POSITIVES AND NEGATIVES**

44. Although the speed of technological change is difficult to assess with any certainty, it is
clear that the time in which a new technology is adopted en-masse is accelerating (see
Figure 1-9 below). It took more than 50 years for 50% of the United States households to
have a telephone following its commercial release, approximately 20 years for mobile
phone adoption and roughly 10 years for 50% smart phone adoption.

Source: New York Times

**Figure 1-9: Accelerating Adoption of Technology**

45. The accelerating adoption of technology within and between states is due in part to
globalised supply chains and the internet. This is likely to be affected by the increasing use
and lowering price of distributed manufacturing, including 3D printing. As a trend it has
both positive and negative implications for international peace and security as greater
number of state and non-state actors are able to obtain access to information or
technology, including those with military applications.

46. Better access to information and technology has obvious benefits in terms of
improving people’s livelihoods. The spread of banking via mobile phone in parts of Africa
enabling farmers to access credit and improve their productivity is a good example of this
trend. The development of cheaper fuel cell or solar power units offering electricity off

traditional, capital-intensive transmission grids could have a similarly positive impact
should it occur.

**1.3.12. DRIVERS OF CONFLICT AND COOPERATION CONCLUSIONS**


**Eastward shift in global power**

Over the past five years the trend of global power
shifting from West to East has continued apace.
By 2030 Asia is expected to have surpassed
North America and Europe combined in terms of
global power based on gross domestic product,
population size, military spending and

technological investment.


**Increasing interconnection**

Although the risk of conflict is heightened during
the shift of economic, military, political and soft
power eastwards, conflict is not inevitable. There
are a number of factors moderating the risk of
major conflict. Primarily, the world is more
interconnected economically than it has ever
been before, encouraging a shared interest in a
prosperous and stable economic environment.
Global norms and international diplomatic

mechanisms encouraging the prevention or deescalation of conflict have also strengthened
since the end of the Cold War.


**Increasing challenges to state borders**

Many of the borders drawn up by former colonial
powers did not necessarily reflect traditional
cultural, ethnic or sectarian boundaries. In the
past five years they have come under increasing
challenge across a number of regions, most
especially in the Middle East. This presents a
challenge to international peace and security that
the international system is not well placed to
address.


**Resource scarcity**

The demand for energy, food and water is
expected to increase by 50%, 35% and 40%
respectively by 2030. Resource scarcity and
climate change are not likely to cause conflict in
and of themselves, but they can aggravate
existing tensions within and between fragile
states or regions with existing or historical
tensions. Tension can also be fuelled in areas
where there are significant untapped natural
resources, such as the South China Sea, or
improving access, such as the Arctic and
Antarctic.


**Demography: uneven effects**

Since the 1970s roughly 80% of all conflicts have
originated in countries with relatively young
(average age under 25) populations. Countries
with young populations have difficulty generating
sufficient employment opportunities for the
increasing number of people entering the
workforce.

Conversely, many developed and developing
countries will soon face, if they do not already,
the effects of declining proportions of working
age people relative to the overall population.
Slower or stagnant economic growth could
contribute to social unrest when combined with
other factors, while a greater proportion of
spending on health, aged care and pensions may
reduce some states’ spending on military
capabilities.


**Rising economic inequality**

In countries with lower levels of economic
development, and where certain ethnic, age,
cultural or religious groups are disproportionally
affected, or where the state is already fragile,
inequality can lead to a greater probability of
conflict. Inequality will continue to be a driver of
conflict in the decades to come unless the
benefits of globalisation are more evenly

distributed across societies. It will also encourage
higher levels of both legal and illegal migration, as
people seek economic opportunities.


DEFENCE ASSESSMENT 2014 18


-----

**Increasing extremism**

Extremism – be it religious, nationalist or
ideological – tends to increase during times of
economic dislocation, and can be exacerbated by
poor governance, repression or discrimination
against a particular cultural, ethic or religious
group. So long as large segments of a population
remain marginalised, extremist groups will

continue to present challenges to the dominant
political order, including through the use of
violence.


**Quickening technology adoption:**
**positives and negatives**

The time in which a new technology is adopted
en-masse in accelerating. This has benefits in
terms of improving people’s livelihoods.

Increasing speeds of adoption also means that in
the future operations the Defence Force may face
increasing threats from groups that would not
have previously been able to field high-end
capabilities.

### 1.4. EVOLVING AREAS OF INTEREST 

**1.4.1. TERRORISM: A CONTINUING THREAT**


47. A terrorist attack has the potential to
cause loss of life, have negative economic
impacts and can cause psychological trauma
on a societal scale. Unless backed by a state
sponsor (such as Al Qa’eda in Afghanistan
under the Taliban), terrorist groups tend to
base themselves in areas where central
state control is weak or non-existent and
recruitment conditions are favourable, such
as areas of high unemployment or political,
cultural or religious discrimination.


**What is the Islamic State of Iraq and the**
**Levant?**

The Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant’s origins
lie in the Al Qaeda in Iraq movement that
sparked the 2006 Iraqi civil war and formed a
shadow government in Sunni areas until a
number of tribes turned against it. It re-emerged
as a faction in the Syrian civil war, before splitting
with the central leadership of Al Qaeda over the
utility of beheading Iraqi Shia captives.

countries, it declared the establishment of an

Hezbollah (based in Lebanon) also pose a Levant’s current strength is estimated to be

threat to Western interests. The success of
the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant in
controlling a large amount of territory across both Iraq and Syria has rapidly increased its
influence within the extremist community, drawing in further funding and fighters (both
foreign and local).


49. In the face of the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant’s rise, Al Qaeda’s senior
leadership in Pakistan is struggling for relevance. It continues to seek to play an
ideological guidance function, with its regional affiliates[9] across the Middle East and North
Africa providing operational expertise, though the latter have conspicuously hedged their
bets by publicly calling for reconciliation between the two organisations (see text box for
further information).

50. The Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant is encouraging its supporters to conduct
terrorist attacks in the West independent of their control. The threat of home-grown, “lonewolf” attacks such as the 2013 Boston Marathon bombing – which are extremely difficult to
detect – therefore remains. Al Qaeda’s senior leadership and its regional affiliates also
continue to seek to conduct attacks in the West and against Western interests

51. Terrorism will remain an enduring threat to the West beyond 2020. The risk of
New Zealanders being caught up in a terrorist attack outside of the West is also an ever
present danger. The countries where Al Qaeda affiliates and the Islamic State of Iraq and
the Levant operates (such as Yemen, Somalia, Libya, Syria and Iraq) are expected to
remain in a fragile or failed state for some time (see Middle East section on page 57 for
further details).

9 This includes Al Qa’eda in the Arabian Peninsula, Al Qa’eda in the Islamic Maghreb, and Al-Nusra in Syria
and Al-Shabaab in Somalia.

**1.4.2. USE OF REMOTELY PILOTED AND AUTONOMOUS VEHICLES**

militaries will acquire these systems, as well
as hostile non-state actors, and they will increasingly be used by civilian government
agencies and businesses.

54. The deployment of fully autonomous systems in a military environment that are
capable of operating independently while making complex decisions is unlikely to occur
until further advances are made in the software needed to enable the system to act in a
safe manner (such as differentiating between friend and foe and civilian and military
targets). Although some experts believe this could occur in the next decade, it is more
likely that such systems will not be fielded until 2040.

55. One potential implication is that the increased use of remotely piloted systems, using
more precise munitions, could reduce barriers to the use of force due to the reduced risk of
human casualties (both pilot and civilians near a target). If the use of force is viewed as a
more acceptable option for resolving disputes this could have negative implications for
global security, and the number of conflicts occurring around the world may rise from its
currently static overall figure.

56. More generally the increasing sophistication of weaponry will continue to raise ethical
issues as new and novel technologies emerge. Such weapons may be used with little
regard for existing legal norms, with specific international norms around new weapons
often lagging far behind their use. Trends in this subject area will need to be closely
monitored.

**1.4.3. GROWING THREATS TO SPACE-BASED INFRASTRUCTURE**

57. The number of satellites continues to increase, along with the range of tasks they
undertake or support, from communications to providing precise global positioning
information. Reliance on space-based systems is increasing correspondingly. A vast range
of everyday activities, from financial transactions that rely on time signals, through to
weather forecasting and military command and control, now rely on space-based systems.

58. Space-based technologies are at risk from a growing range of manmade threats and
natural hazards, such as solar flares. The primary changes in space since the last
assessment are an increasing amount of space debris from defunct satellites, and an
upward trend in earth-based systems being reliant on space-based infrastructure.

DEFENCE ASSESSMENT 2014 21


-----

59. Some countries are also developing anti-satellite weapons that can physically destroy
a satellite in orbit. Physical destruction of satellites is particularly concerning as it
increases the amount of space debris, which has significant collateral damage impacts for
all space users and activities.

**1.4.4. CYBER THREATS: EVOLVING RAPIDLY**

60. Information technology is evolving rapidly, making accurate predictions around the
development of cyber threats beyond the short term extremely difficult. The amount of data
stored digitally, and the number of devices connected to each other and the internet, is
rising rapidly. This increase in the volume of data and the number of connected devices
represents an exponential expansion in importance and scope of what is referred to as
cyberspace.

61. Cyberspace is not like the traditional maritime, land and air domains. It is a human
construct and comprises both physical (computer and information networks) and intangible
elements (information and data). Much of the physical infrastructure is privately owned,
ranging from an individual’s computers through to a telecommunication company’s
international networks. This has important implications for the use of cyberspace by the
Government, and also for the military.

62. The cyber threat to all nations, including New Zealand, is growing markedly. Observed
malicious cyber activity in New Zealand is increasing. This increasing threat has
implications for the Defence Force.

**1.4.5. INCREASING INFORMATION CHALLENGES**

63. Increasing speeds of technology adoption mean that maintaining an information
advantage in future operations will become a more difficult task. The proliferation of
information technologies means that actors which would not have previously been able to
field high-end capabilities may have sophisticated and effective influencing,

communications, intelligence, surveillance, reconnaissance and command and control
capabilities. Conversely, when undertaking operations, advanced militaries will also be
faced with effectively managing and using increased volumes and diverse information
sources.

64. To maintain a comparative advantage, armed forces will need to become proficient at
utilising the information resources and the tools available to them. They will also need to
develop doctrine and systems for responding to the information activities of adversaries.
The increasing adoption of information technology has implications for the pace at which
the Defence Force chooses to adopt new technologies or capabilities. These implications
will need to be explored further.

DEFENCE ASSESSMENT 2014 22


-----

**1.4.6. EVOLVING AREAS OF INTEREST CONCLUSIONS**


**Terrorism: a continuing threat**

Terrorism will remain an enduring threat to the
West beyond 2020. The Syrian civil war has
proven to be a catalyst for the resurgence of
Sunni Islamist extremism, though Shia groups
such as Hezbollah also pose a threat to Western
interests. The return of radicalised fighters from
the conflict in Syria and Iraq is a growing global
concern.


**Use of remotely piloted systems**

The use of remotely piloted systems has
continued to proliferate over the past five years.
More militaries will acquire these systems, and
they will increasingly be used by civilian
organisations.


**Growing threats to space-based**
**infrastructure**

All advanced economies are highly reliant on
space-based systems for their economic

prosperity and defence and security. Spacebased technologies are at risk from a growing
range of manmade threats and natural hazards
like solar flares. Satellites are also increasingly
vulnerable with some countries developing antisatellite weapons that can physically destroy a
satellite in orbit.


**Cyber threat**

A number of high profile cyber attacks have
highlighted how cyber is now a business as usual
element of a nation’s defence and security. The
number of states with such capabilities is
increasing over time.

The cyber threat to all nations, including New
Zealand, is growing markedly.

Information technology is evolving rapidly, making
accurate predictions around the development of
cyber threats beyond the short term extremely
difficult.


**Increasing information challenges**


Increasing speeds of technology adoption mean
that maintaining an information advantage in
future operations will become a more difficult
task. Actors which would not have previously
been able to field high-end capabilities may have
sophisticated and effective influencing,

communications, and command and control
capabilities.

This has implications, which will need to be
explored further, for the pace at which the
Defence Force chooses to adopt new

technologies and capabilities.

## 2. GEOGRAPHIC STRATEGIC ASSESSMENT

Chapter Two assesses the trends identified in the previous chapter through a
geographic lens. Beginning with New Zealand, it moves onto Antarctica,
Australia, the South Pacific, the Asia-Pacific and then the rest of the world. All
sections seek to place identified trends within short, medium or long-term
contexts.

### 2.1 NEW ZEALAND

Multiple challenges

65. New Zealand’s vulnerability to risks and threats is heavily influenced by our small size,
isolated location, unique geology, and exposure to natural hazards. But we also have a
particular combination of other factors – including the
structure of our economy, export dependence, and a
vast maritime domain – which influence our national
security in a fundamental way. Our understanding of
threats to New Zealand is based on an “all hazards /
all risks” approach in which government agencies
work in concert on their mitigation. This includes
geological threats (earthquakes, tsunamis and

volcanic eruptions); meteorological threats (strong
wind, heavy rain and snow); biological threats
(pandemics, and animal and plant pests affecting
primary production); and all forms of transnational and
organised crime (discussed further in the managing
maritime threats section below).

**2.1.1. NO DIRECT THREAT TO NEW ZEALAND’S TERRITORIAL INTEGRITY**

66. New Zealand does not presently face a direct threat of physical invasion and
occupation of New Zealand territory. The likelihood of such a threat to the Cook Islands,
Niue, Tokelau and territory over which we have a sovereign claim, emerging before 2040
is judged to be very low, and would be preceded by significant change to the international
security environment. New Zealand could therefore expect to have a reasonable amount
of time to re-orientate its defence priorities should this be necessary.

DEFENCE ASSESSMENT 2014 25


-----

**2.1.2. EVOLVING THREATS**

67. Although there is no direct threat to our territorial integrity, New Zealand faces a range
of other threats from state and non-state actors, including cyber threats and terrorism.

68. New Zealand’s relative geographical isolation offers little or no protection from cyber
threats. This threat is likely to continue to increase as the number of state, and to a lesser
extent non-state, actors with offensive cyber capabilities increases. This is a significant
change for New Zealand as our geography has provided a considerable defensive
advantage against physical threats.

69. As more systems, including those of the Defence Force, come to depend on
interconnected networks this will increase opportunities for remote disruption, increasing
its vulnerability. The diffusion of offensive cyber capabilities means that all future Defence
Force operations will need to be cognisant of this threat and take appropriate protective
and defensive measures.

70. New Zealand is a potential terrorist target. The risk of a terrorist attack in New Zealand
increased from very low to low in October 2014. This was due primarily to the small
number of New Zealand citizens that are engaged in terrorism-related activities in conflict
zones, such as Syria and Iraq. The threat to New Zealand relates largely to how such
individuals behave should they return to New Zealand.

**2.1.3. RELIANCE ON SPACE-BASED SYSTEMS**

71. Like all nations, New Zealand relies on space-based systems for basic services such
as time-keeping, navigation and meteorology. Significant disruption would have a severe
impact on the New Zealand’s economic prosperity and potentially public safety. With only
one undersea fibre optic cable, the resilience offered by space-based systems may make
it comparatively more important to New Zealand than for some other nations. The Defence
Force’s critical infrastructure also relies on space-based technologies. Imagery and
navigation services are also of vital importance to military and civilian activities.

**2.1.4. INCREASING CHALLENGES TO MANAGING MARITIME THREATS**

72. The size of New Zealand’s maritime domain, its intrinsic value, and challenges around
its management underlines the significance of maritime threats to New Zealand. The
Defence Force is the only agency that maintains disciplined forces available at short notice
with large-scale, integrated fleets of vehicles, ships, and aircraft. It is therefore able to
undertake or support a range of tasks as part of an all-of-government effort directed by
civil authorities. This includes maritime resource protection, humanitarian assistance and
disaster relief, search and rescue, constabulary tasks such as preventing transnational
crime, including people smuggling, responding to maritime pollution incidents and
providing support to the Department of Conservation’s efforts to protect endangered
species on our offshore islands.

DEFENCE ASSESSMENT 2014 26


-----

73. The requirement to undertake such tasks within our Exclusive Economic Zone – as
well as our wider maritime search and rescue area of responsibility which stretches from
Antarctica to the equator – is expected to increase over time. (see Figure 2-1 below). Such
a large area to monitor tests the Defence Force’s ability to understand what is occurring
within our maritime domain. Further work in this area is required.

**Figure 2-1: Maritime Boundaries**


**Figure 2-1: Maritime Boundaries**


74. Nevertheless, there are a number of indicators which point to how the Defence Force’s
future tasking requirements might change. One area that bears close scrutiny in the future
given its importance to our economy is the risk of illegal, unregulated and unreported
fishing within our Exclusive Economic Zone. The New Zealand fisheries management
system currently uses a mix of controls on both the total amount of fish that can be taken
and on fishing methods, seasons, and size limits. Although illegal, unregulated and
unreported fishing within our Exclusive Economic Zone is not thought to be a major
problem presently, predicted scarcity in other regions may make New Zealand’s Exclusive
Economic Zone a far more attractive target in the future.

75. The National Maritime Coordination Centre is starting to receive requests for
monitoring of oil pollution from foreign fishing vessels using the Defence Force’s maritime
patrol and aerial surveillance capabilities. Such requests are likely to increase in the future.

76. Although the number of pleasure craft / recreational vessels arriving in New Zealand
has plateaued in recent years, the number of cruise ships is expected to continue to
increase. While the increase does not mean an incident requiring a search and rescue

DEFENCE ASSESSMENT 2014 27


-----

response is inevitable, the likelihood of one occurring is elevated as the market grows in
size.

77. The requirement for the protection of offshore oil and gas drilling platforms from those
seeking to interfere with companies’ lawful activities may increase in the future depending
on the extent of future drilling. In the medium term, such protection may also be necessary
to protect sea-bed mining activities.

78. There are indications that people smugglers are showing an increasing interest in New
Zealand and / or New Zealand Realm countries in the South Pacific.

**2.1.5. MORE DOMESTIC DISASTER RESPONSE AND RECOVERY**

79. New Zealand faces significant geological hazards (earthquakes, tsunami and volcanic
activity), associated with its location on the boundary of the Australian and Pacific plates. It
also faces meteorological hazards including flooding, severe winds, extreme cold and
droughts. Climate change is exacerbating many of these hazards through long-term trends
towards higher temperatures, more hot extremes, fewer cold extremes, and shifting rainfall
patterns in some regions. More change is expected including sea level rise, shifts in wind
speed and direction and increased risk of wildfire. The Defence Force can therefore expect
a steadily increasing requirement for domestic disaster response and recovery out to
2040.

**2.1.6. CHALLENGING DEMOGRAPHICS**

80. New Zealand’s population is projected to continue its slow growth from 4.4 million in
2012 to 5.4 million in 2036. Also increasing is the percentage of people aged 65 and over.
The number of people aged 20-24, however, is expected to remain roughly static over this
period. As this is the prime demographic group for recruitment into the Defence Force, a
static population size could present difficulties should the size of the Defence Force need
to be increased substantially in the future.

DEFENCE ASSESSMENT 2014 28


-----

**2.1.7. NEW ZEALAND ASSESSMENT CONCLUSIONS**


**No direct military threat to**
**New Zealand’s territorial integrity**

New Zealand does not presently face a direct
military threat of physical invasion and

occupation of New Zealand territory. The
likelihood of such a threat to the Cook Islands,
Niue, Tokelau and territory over which we have a
sovereign claim, emerging before 2040 is judged
to be very low, and would be preceded by
significant change to the international security
environment.


**Evolving threats**

New Zealand’s relative geographical isolation
offers little or no protection from cyber threats.
This threat is likely to continue to increase as the
number of actors with cyber capabilities

increases.

The probability of a terrorist attack in

New Zealand was increased from very low to low
in October 2014. This is due primarily to the small
number of New Zealand citizens that are engaged
in terrorism-related activities in conflict zones,
such as Syria and Iraq.


**High reliance on space-based**
**systems**

Like all nations, New Zealand relies on spacebased systems for basic services such as timekeeping, navigation and meteorology. Significant
disruption would have a severe impact on the
New Zealand’s economic prosperity and

potentially public safety. With only one undersea
fibre optic cable, the resilience offered by spacebased systems may make it comparatively more
important to New Zealand than for some other
nations. The Defence Force’s critical

infrastructure is also highly reliant on spacebased technologies.


**Increasing challenges to managing**
**maritime threats**

The size of New Zealand’s maritime domain, its
intrinsic value, and challenges around its

management underlines the significance of
maritime threats to New Zealand. The

requirement to undertake tasks within our
Exclusive Economic Zone – as well as our wider
maritime search and rescue area of responsibility
which stretches from Antarctica to the equator –
is expected to increase over time.


**More domestic disaster response and**
**recovery**

The Defence Force can expect a steadily
increasing requirement for domestic disaster
response and recovery out to 2040 due to the
effects of climate change: higher temperatures,
more hot extremes, fewer cold extremes, and
shifting rainfall patterns in some regions.


**Challenging demographics**

New Zealand’s population is projected to continue
its slow growth from 4.4 million in 2012 to 5.4
million in 2036. The number of people aged 2024, however, is expected to remain roughly static.
As this is the prime demographic group for
recruitment into the Defence Force, a static
population size could present difficulties should
the size of the Defence Force need to be
increased substantially in the future.

2007-2008 peak of 34,000. Even with the recent dip in numbers, tourism in Antarctica is
growing at an unprecedented rate. Numbers are conservatively estimated to reach 60,000
annually by 2020 as reductions in sea ice ease passage.

83. New Zealand has an international legal search and rescue obligation in the Ross Sea
region of Antarctica. We conduct maritime aerial surveillance patrols each Antarctic
summer to deter illegal, unregulated and unreported fishing. As traffic and activity

### 2.3. AUSTRALIA

New Zealand’s most important bilateral relationship

84. Our most significant security partnership is with
our treaty ally Australia. Through its size, location
and strategic reach Australia contributes significantly
to New Zealand’s security. New Zealand therefore
has an abiding interest in contributing to a safe and
secure Australia. A direct armed attack on Australia
is unlikely and Australia remains vigilant in the face of
continued non-traditional threats such as terrorism
and cyber security.

**2.3.1. SHARED SECURITY INTERESTS AND**

**PERSPECTIVES**

85. New Zealand and Australia share similar

perspectives on, and an enduring interest in, the
security and prosperity of the South Pacific. Our
militaries have operated together in Timor-Leste and Solomon Islands over the past 15
years and although these deployments have come to an end, we will continue to work
together in support of building the capability and resilience of Pacific Island countries’
security sectors. New Zealand and Australia also share a common interest in the peaceful
accommodation of China’s rise within the existing rules-based international order. Both
countries advocate for the peaceful resolution of maritime boundary disputes in the East
and South China Seas.

86. Comprehensive government efforts to combat sea-borne people smuggling have
successfully reduced the number of illegal migrants seeking to enter Australian territory by
sea over the past few years.

**2.3.2. COMPLEMENTARY CAPABILITIES**

87. Increasing the interoperability of our forces will continue to be a strong focus for the
future. Current levels of interoperability are high, with good commonality across doctrine,
tactics, standards and procedures and strong people-to-people links through training,
exercising and exchanges. It is now a matter of course that interoperability is considered
as an important factor during our capability development process, including the possibility
of joint purchases of military equipment where appropriate.

88. Although our capabilities will differ in their sophistication, interoperability will be
maintained by ensuring that our communications, command and control, and data transfer
systems can talk to each other. Personnel exchanges and regular exercises are also
important in this regard.

**2.3.3. AUSTRALIA ASSESSMENT CONCLUSIONS**


**New Zealand’s most important**
**bilateral relationship**

Our most significant security partnership is with
our treaty ally Australia. Australia contributes
significantly to New Zealand’s security through
its size, location and strategic reach.

New Zealand therefore has an abiding interest in
contributing to a safe and secure Australia.


**Complementary capabilities**


Due to the highly advanced nature of many of
Australia’s planned acquisitions, the gap in
capability between our forces is expected to
increase. This will not affect our level of
interoperability (which remains high) or our ability
to operate together in the South Pacific, where it
matters most.


**Shared security interests and**
**perspectives**

New Zealand and Australia share similar
perspectives on, and an enduring interest in, the
security and prosperity of the South Pacific.

New Zealand and Australia also share a common
interest in the peaceful accommodation of

### 2.4. SOUTH PACIFIC 

Enduring New Zealand interests

89. New Zealand has a direct and
enduring interest in the security,
stability and prosperity of the South
Pacific. The region constitutes our
immediate neighbourhood, with

strong people links underpinned by
historical, cultural and economic
connections. We have legal

obligations towards the Cook

Islands, Niue and Tokelau, a special
relationship with Samoa, and Pacific
leaders generally turn to us in times
of need, particularly in response to
natural disasters.

90. What happens in the Pacific
region, and how we respond, affects
migration, development assistance and
security. New Zealand and Australia
look to work closely with Pacific Island
governments on security and other
issues in the region. Our engagement in
the Pacific will continue to be important
to our domestic and international

interests in the future.


**Importance of fisheries to Pacific well-being**

The Pacific tuna stock is valued at about US$2.4 billion
annually and is the main source of income in the
Pacific, contributing US$260 million to combined gross
domestic product and providing over 13,000 jobs to
Pacific Island people.


91. The South Pacific region is defined by differences, even within its sub-regions of
Polynesia and Melanesia. Generalised region-wide assessment is therefore difficult. That
said, overall the region continues to face difficulties stemming from narrow economic
bases (Papua New Guinea being the exception), low resilience to frequent natural
disasters, rising transnational organised crime and in some cases poor governance and
corruption. Of the two sub regions Melanesia faces the most chronic social, economic, and
environmental stresses.

92. It is likely that over the next ten years, New Zealand will deploy military and other
assets in support of a Pacific Islands Forum member in crisis beyond standard disaster
response support.

**2.4.1. NO DIRECT MILITARY THREAT BUT INCREASING CHALLENGES**

93. Like New Zealand, the South Pacific is not expected to face a direct military threat
from outside the region over the assessment period. Threats in the South Pacific stem
largely from the stability and sustainability of each nation, related to both internal and
external economic, political, demographic, military, and environmental factors.

94. A significant vulnerability for Pacific countries, given their wide geographic dispersion
is effectively controlling their borders. Although there is no direct military threat,
transnational organised crime is an increasing challenge to Pacific states. Illegal,

DEFENCE ASSESSMENT 2014 34


-----

unregulated and unreported fishing in particular is a rising transnational threat with losses
estimated to be up to NZ$400 million per year.

95. Pacific Island nations lose not only valuable income, but the viability of their own
fishing ventures as it becomes uneconomic for them to fish legally in competition with
illegal, unregulated and unreported fishing vessels. This has flow-on effects for economic
and social stability. Global demand for fish is expected to continue to increase and
inevitably this will place more pressure on Pacific pelagic fisheries, including from distant
water fishing nations. With most Pacific states relying heavily on fisheries to support their
economies, their depletion will increase dependence on foreign developmental assistance.

96. Transnational organised crime groups are increasing in number and becoming further
entrenched in the Pacific, carrying with it high economic and social costs. The impact of
transnational organised crime can be disproportionately large given their generally small
populations. Activities include trafficking in illicit commodities such as drugs, wildlife and
firearms; people smuggling; and financial and cyber-crime. Transnational organised crime
groups’ activities also present an indirect threat to New Zealand, as well as Pacific states,
as a destination for illicit goods.

**2.4.2. SECURITY SECTOR**

97. Three Pacific nations have formal defence forces: Papua New Guinea, Fiji and Tonga.
In countries without defence forces, such as Vanuatu and Samoa, the police seek to fulfil
tasks performed by militaries elsewhere, such as surveillance of Exclusive Economic
Zones. New Zealand (and Australia) can expect continued requests for support in this
area.

98. The region shares generally similar views on the importance of disaster response
capabilities. Fiji also makes substantial contributions to international peace support
operations.


**Pacific Island Military Forces**

Papua New Guinea Defence Force: Approximately 2500 personnel. It consists of a land element with two
light infantry and one engineer battalion, an air element with limited light fixed wing transport and
helicopters, and a maritime element with two landing craft and four Pacific-class patrol boats.

His Majesty’s Armed Forces (Tonga): Consists of a small 600-strong force with operational land
experience. The naval element is equipped with three Pacific-class patrol boats.

Republic of Fiji Military Forces: Approximately 3,600 personnel. The land element has one regular light
infantry battalion based in Fiji and another two permanently deployed overseas on multinational
peacekeeping operations, as well as an engineer regiment and a territorial force. The naval element
operates three Pacific-class patrol boats and two coastal patrol craft.


**2.4.3. ECONOMIC PROSPECTS**

99. With the exception of Papua New Guinea and its vast natural gas resources, most
Pacific economies are relatively small, narrowly based, and vulnerable to external financial
shocks and the impacts of natural disasters. Given these factors, improving economic and
trade prospects is a challenging undertaking. A mixture of remittances, tourism, income
from fisheries, low income inequality, and other resources, such as labour mobility, are
expected to largely prevent economic factors from driving instability in the region.

DEFENCE ASSESSMENT 2014 35


-----

**2.4.4. DEMOGRAPHIC CHANGE: MIXED TRENDS ACROSS THE REGION**

100. The Pacific’s population is expected to grow significantly over the coming decades
– from 10 million in 2010 to an estimated 18 million in 2050. The distribution of the
population will be highly uneven, with sustained population growth in Melanesia and
Micronesia (Papua New Guinea’s growth rate is estimated to be 3.1%) contrasting with
declining rates in some parts of Polynesia. Strong population growth where it is occurring
is generating very young societies (over 50% of the Pacific population is under the age of
25). With surging working age populations, the majority of urbanised youth lack education
and employment opportunities, which increases the likelihood of social and political unrest.
In Polynesia a lack of population growth, combined with skills shortages generated by
migration to New Zealand, Australia and further afield, presents its own set of problems.

101. At the same time, increasing numbers of expatriates and foreign workers,
particularly from Asia, are migrating to many Pacific states. Tensions between the different
ethnicities are likely to be an on-going issue.

**2.4.5. INCREASING ENVIRONMENTAL CHALLENGES**

102. Population growth, urbanisation, poor governance, and lack of planning are to
varying degrees contributing to water pollution, coastal degradation, loss of indigenous
forestry resources and unsustainable pressure on fisheries and other natural resources.
These challenges are already being exacerbated by the effects of human-induced climate
change, which are expected to continue to increase over time.

103. Sea levels in the Pacific will rise, perhaps by 1.2 meters by 2100, and temperatures
anywhere between 1 and 4 degrees. Rainfall will be less predictable, and cyclones and
storm surges are likely to be more intense and frequent. This will result in immediate
damage to infrastructure, power and water supplies, as well has having longer term effects
on agricultural productivity and migratory fisheries. There is limited capacity in the Pacific
to build preparedness for, and resilience to, climate-related disasters.

104. Climate-induced migration is not likely to become a pressing issue in the short-term
but could become more prominent in the coming decades as low-lying atoll states are
increasingly affected by sea level rise. If mass migration is necessary there will be
significant questions to be addressed with regards to where environmental migrants will
resettle, as well as the status of a country’s Exclusive Economic Zone if it is no longer
above the water line.

**2.4.6. RISING INFLUENCE OF NON-TRADITIONAL ACTORS**

105. Access to natural resources, the region’s 14 United Nations General Assembly
votes, and general competition for global influence is driving an increasing number of
states towards engagement with Pacific states. Pacific states themselves are also seeking
to develop stronger international linkages.

106. A greater range of countries are developing relationships with Pacific states,
including defence relationships in some cases. New Zealand will continue to maintain our
enduring people-to-people links and significant development assistance programmes. We
will continue to be among the first responders in the event of a humanitarian disaster. New
donors in the region also provide expanded partnership opportunities, such as New
Zealand’s solar power project with the United Arab Emirates in Tonga. The partnership
between France, Australia and New Zealand (known as FRANZ) remains in good stead,

DEFENCE ASSESSMENT 2014 36

with France expected to retain a strong presence in the Pacific, the United States and
European Union also retain significant development programmes and interests in the
region.

**2.4.7. SOUTH PACIFIC ASSESSMENT CONCLUSIONS**


**Enduring New Zealand interests**

New Zealand has a direct and enduring interest
in the security, stability and prosperity of the
South Pacific. We have legal obligations towards
the Cook Islands, Niue and Tokelau, a special
relationship with Samoa, and Pacific leaders
generally turn to us in times of need, particularly
in response to natural disasters.

The international community expects

New Zealand and Australia to take the lead on
security and other issues in the region. Our
engagement in the Pacific will therefore continue
to be important to our domestic and international
interests in the future.


**Pacific challenges**

The region continues to face substantial

difficulties stemming from narrow and difficult to
grow economic bases (Papua New Guinea being
the exception), low resilience to frequent natural
disasters, and rising trans-national organised
crime. Of the two sub regions Melanesia faces
the most chronic social, economic, and

environmental stresses.

It is likely that over the next ten years, New
Zealand will deploy military and other assets in
support of a Pacific Islands Forum member in
crisis beyond standard disaster response support.


**Rising influence of non-traditional**
**actors**

A greater range of are developing relationships

### 2.5. NORTH ASIA 

Vital to our national interests

107. As home to two of the world’s four largest
economies (China and Japan), the security and
prosperity of North Asia is vital to our national
interests. Any major conflict in North Asia would
have the potential to draw in actors from outside
the region, including New Zealand and Australia.
The Defence Force remains an important element
of New Zealand’s overall approach to promoting
regional peace and security.

**2.5.1. RAPIDLY INCREASING CHINESE**

**POWER**

108. Nowhere is the shift in global influence
eastwards more striking than in North Asia, driven primarily by three decades of sustained
economic growth in China. The latest projections suggest that China will become the
world’s largest economy over the next decade.


109. Like other states in Asia,
China’s rapid economic growth has
enabled an increase in its defence
spending. China’s publicly reported
defence expenditure increased from
US$38 billion in 2004 to

US$115 billion in 2013, representing
double digit year-on-year increases
but a static spend in terms of gross
domestic product, at 1.3%.


**The United States rebalancing to the**
**Asia-Pacific**

The United States Government is increasing its

US$38 billion in 2004 to investment in the Asia-Pacific. Part of the rebalancing

absolute terms. Much of its spending
is focused on developing capabilities that expand China’s ability to conduct military
operations in areas outside of its own territory, including a larger more capable submarine
fleet, advanced combat aircraft, aircraft carriers, ballistic and cruise missile programmes,
and cyber capabilities.


**2.5.2. MULTIPLE FACTORS DRIVING TENSION IN THE REGION**

111. As noted on page 10, changes in the balance of power tend to increase the
likelihood of conflict as states acclimatise and adapt to new political dynamics. A period of
natural tension in Asia is being exacerbated, however, by a number of aggravating factors.

112. Competition for control of hydro-carbon rich territory is adding to tension across the
region. Attempts to lay claim to contested territory via regular patrolling, occupation of
islands, and over-flights, increases the risks of minor clashes escalating into more serious
conflict.

**Figure 2-3: Average Increase in Percentage Point Share of Global Gross Domestic Product**

113. China’s rise is also occurring at an unprecedented pace. Between 2000 and 2020
China’s share of global gross domestic product will increase by just over 5% per decade.
In comparison, in the 50 years leading up to the peak of United States global gross
domestic product in 1950, its increase was just over 2% per decade (see Figure 2-3
above). China’s rapid rise is decreasing the amount of time other countries have in which
to adapt to changing power dynamics.

114. In addition to its regular provocations, North Korea’s nuclear missile programme is a
further factor exacerbating tension in the region.

**2.5.3. RESPONDING TO RISING TENSIONS AND THE CHANGING BALANCE OF**

**POWER**

115. Countries in the region are responding to the changing balance of power with a
variety of strategies. Defence spending across the region has risen by 23% since 2010,
including the purchase of submarines, anti-ship missiles, warships and maritime
surveillance assets.

116. In 2013, Japan announced the first percentage increase in its nominal defence
budget in 11 years, to US$51 billion, including the purchase of helicopter-carriers and Joint
Strike Fighters. 2014 has also seen the Japanese government reinterpret Article 9 of its
constitution to allow for military action in conjunction with its allies in pursuit of collective
self defence, as well as relaxing restrictions on Japanese involvement in United Nations
peace support operations.

117. Reflecting its enduring interests in the region, the United States has been seeking
to “rebalance” its political and military focus away from the Middle East and South Asia

DEFENCE ASSESSMENT 2014 39


-----

towards the Asia-Pacific.[10] The “rebalance”, as it has become known, is driven by the
increasing economic importance of the region. It includes strengthening its traditional
alliance relationships with South Korea, Japan, Philippines and Thailand, as well as
bolstering relations with Malaysia, Indonesia, Singapore and Vietnam.

118. In a practical military sense this includes the rotational deployment of 2500
United States Marines in Darwin; the positioning of two additional missile defence
destroyers in Japan, and up to four littoral combat ships in Singapore; naval deployments
to the Philippines for the first time since 1992; and a commitment to increase the number
of carrier strike groups in the Asia-Pacific from five to six (out of ten total).

119. Like the United States, Russia is increasing its focus on North Asia. It is seeking
new markets for its primary exports (weapons, oil and gas and other natural resources)
and is attempting to reduce its reliance on Europe. This includes the construction of a
$420 billion, 4,000km long natural gas pipeline from Eastern Siberia to China. Russia has
also increased maritime and aerial patrolling, improved the capability of its military forces
in the region and increased the readiness of its forces through major military exercises. Its
influence and importance in the region could increase in the future should the Northern
Passage across Russia’s northern coastline become a feasible alternative shipping route
between Europe and Asia.

**2.5.4. OUTLOOK: RISING TENSIONS BUT GROUNDS FOR CAUTIOUS OPTIMISM**

120. Historically, the rise of a newly powerful state was often characterised by conflict
with the existing power. Germany challenged the United Kingdom and United States in the
early 20[th] century, Japan and Germany likewise in the 1930s and 1940s, and the Soviet
Union challenged the West during the Cold War, though primarily through proxy conflicts
and espionage activities.

121. Overall, the risk of major inter-state conflict in the region is rising. Clashes in the
maritime domain, combined with the more sophisticated military capabilities being fielded
by many actors, are increasing the risk of escalation or miscalculation leading to major
conflict. Hot spots abound, from maritime disputes in the East and South China Seas;
cross-strait relations; and on-going tension on the Korean Peninsula.

122. Despite the rising tensions outlined above the likelihood of major conflict remains
low. Unlike the Cold War, all states in Asia (with the exception of North Korea) are fully
integrated into the global economy. This provides a powerful incentive for all regional
actors to maintain a stable environment, conducive to economic growth and trade.

10 Although there is no clear cut definition of what constitutes the Asia-Pacific, it commonly includes South
Asia, South East Asia, North Asia, and all states within and bordering the Pacific.

**2.5.5. NORTH ASIA ASSESSMENT CONCLUSIONS**


**Fundamental New Zealand interests**

Home to two of the world’s four largest
economies (China and Japan), the security and
prosperity of North Asia is of intense interest to
New Zealand. As New Zealand’s largest trading
partner the bilateral relationship with China is one
of our most important. Japan is a valuable
strategic partner to New Zealand, our fourth
largest trading partner, and is a major source of
tourists, international students, and foreign
investment. New Zealand also maintains a solid
relationship with South Korea.


**Rapidly increasing Chinese power**

China’s rapid economic growth has enabled an
increase in its defence spending, much of which
is focused on developing force projection
capabilities Chinese military power will continue
to increase in relative and absolute terms.


**Multiple factors driving tension in the**
**region**

Competition for control of hydro-carbon rich
territory, the unprecedented pace of China’s rise
in influence and North Korea’s nuclear missile
programme is adding to tension across the
region. Attempts to lay claim to contested
increases the risks of minor clashes escalating
into more serious conflict.


**Responding to rising tensions and the**
**changing balance of power**

Defence spending across the region has risen by
23% since 2010. Force posture is also changing,
demonstrated by the Japanese Government’s
reinterpretation of its constitution to allow for
military action in conjunction with its allies in
pursuit of collective self defence. The United
States has also been seeking to “rebalance” its
political and military focus away from the Middle
East and South Asia towards the Asia-Pacific.


**Outlook: rising tensions but grounds**
**for cautious optimism**

Overall the risk of major inter-state conflict in the
region is rising. Despite this the likelihood of
major conflict remains low. Unlike the Cold War,
all states (with the exception of North Korea) are
fully integrated into the global economy. This
provides a powerful incentive for all regional
actors to maintain a stable environment,

conducive to economic growth and trade.

### 2.6. SOUTH EAST ASIA

Growing New Zealand interests

123. The ten nations that comprise the

Association of South East Asian Nations[11] are
becoming increasingly important to

New Zealand’s future. Already our 4[th] largest
trading partner, the South East Asian region
represents one of the world’s strongest centres of
economic growth and is therefore an attractive
destination for New Zealand exports.


124. The region is also important geopolitically
to New Zealand and the wider world. The world’s
busiest shipping lane passes through the region
from the Indian Ocean on its way to North Asia,
which includes passing through the choke point of
the Malacca Strait. The region is likely to remain a
focus for great power competition for influence. In these respects South East Asia will
have a pivotal influence over New Zealand’s immediate and long-term future.

125. Our security relationships with Malaysia and Singapore continue to be our most
enduring in the region, based in part on the longstanding Five Power Defence
Arrangements, which also includes Australia and the United Kingdom. Although the Five
Power Defence Arrangements has diminished in importance as a strategic defence
arrangement, it retains its value diplomatically. It provides us with an entry point into the
region, demonstrates our enduring commitment to regional security and is a useful
instrument through which to strengthen our wider bilateral relationships with Malaysia and
Singapore.

**2.6.1. STEADY LEVELS OF INTER AND INTRA-STATE TENSION**

126. The region is expected to remain relatively free of internal tension in the short to
medium term. Where tension exists, outside of the areas outlined above, it is primarily a
result of overlapping maritime claims in the South China Sea (see section 2.5.2 on
page 38 for further details).

127. Low-level separatist activities are expected to continue in Southern Thailand, the
Papua region of Indonesia, and may reduce in the Southern Philippines. An agreement
between the Philippines government and the Moro Islamic Liberation Front ending their
insurgency in return for greater autonomy and economic development, should it be
comprehensively implemented, would have a positive impact on the security of the region
as the space for transnational terrorist groups such as Abu Sayaf to train and operate
would be significantly reduced.

128. Myanmar has made progress towards democratic governance, though it continues
to face significant challenges. Fledging democracies are especially vulnerable to
instability, particularly if improvements in economic well being are not immediately felt.

11 The ten nations that comprise Association of South East Asian Nations are Brunei, Cambodia, Indonesia,
Laos, Malaysia, Myanmar, Philippines, Singapore, Thailand, and Viet Nam.

DEFENCE ASSESSMENT 2014 42


-----

How the Myanmar government manages its relations with its ethnic minorities in a newly
democratic environment, especially those with standing armies, will be a key challenge.

129. The security situation in Timor-Leste has remained calm following the departure of
the International Stabilisation Force and United Nations Mission in Timor-Leste at the end
of 2012.There is a low likelihood of armed conflict in the short to medium term akin to the
violence that erupted in 2006.

**2.6.2. INCREASING MILITARY CAPABILITY**

130. Many nations of South East Asia have increased the capability of their armed forces
since the last defence assessment, and are expected to continue to do so over the coming
decades. There have been substantial increases in defence spending in absolute terms
(see Figure 2-4 on page 44). As a proportion of gross domestic product, however, defence
spending has either reduced, or remained relatively static in line with their increasing
wealth.

131. Drivers for the increase in spending and capability include many nations’ growing
ability to allocate resources to externally-focussed capabilities in line with their rising
wealth; support for domestic industry; and perceived threats from other nations, primarily
in relation to territorial claims in the South China Sea.

132. Overall, South East Asian nations’ military capability is expected to continue to
increase. Capability acquisition is likely to focus on modern submarines, expanded surface
fleets with advanced armaments, and ships and aircraft that enable the deployment and
sustainment of military forces overseas. The growing military capability amongst South
East Asian nations increases the possibility of confrontation or escalation between them or
with external actors.

**2.6.3. REGIONAL SECURITY ARCHITECTURE: MEASURED EVOLUTION**

133. The region’s main multilateral security forums have emerged from the Association

of South East Asian Nations and remain central to this grouping (see Figure 2-5 over
page).[12] Their pace and direction are largely determined by the organisation’s guiding
principles of consensus and non-interference in one another’s affairs.

134. Cooperation is therefore likely to continue to be aimed at management, rather than
the resolution, of regional tensions in order to maintain consensus among its members.
Given the differences in national interests among members, it is unlikely that the existing
regional architecture will develop into a more integrated community along the lines of the
North Atlantic Treaty Organisation in the short to medium term, although work towards the
establishment of an integrated political-security community in 2015 continues.

135. Nevertheless, the past five years has seen a collective effort to invigorate the
regional security architecture in order to build habits of dialogue on difficult issues, such as
regional maritime disputes. Willingness to work on less divisive issues, such as disaster
relief and counter-terrorism, is also promoting cooperation and dialogue. The
establishment of the Association of South East Asian Nations Defence Ministers’ Meeting
Plus in 2010, which includes the United States, India, Russia, China, Japan, South Korea,
Australia and New Zealand, was a welcome development. Before its inception there was
no mechanism to bring the region’s defence Ministers together, or to support the kinds of
practical military-to-military cooperation between the United States, China, Russia, Japan
and India that the Ministers’ meeting now sponsors.

12 This includes the Association of South East Asian Nations Regional Forum, the East Asia Summit, and the
Association of South East Asian Nations Defence Ministers’ Meeting Plus.

**Growing New Zealand interests**


**Increasing military capability**


The ten nations that comprise the Association of
South East Asian Nations are becoming

increasingly important to New Zealand’s future.
The region represents one of the world’s
strongest centres of economic growth.

The region is important geopolitically to

New Zealand and the wider world. The world’s
busiest shipping lane passes through the region
from the Indian Ocean on its way to North Asia,
which includes passing through the choke point
of the Malacca Strait. The region is likely to
remain a focus for great power competition for
influence.


Many of the South East Asia nations have
increased the capability of their armed forces
since the last defence assessment, and are
expected to continue to do so over the coming
decades. Drivers for the increase in spending and
capability include many nations’ growing ability to
allocate resources to externally-focussed

capabilities in line with their rising wealth; support
for domestic industry; and territorial claims in the
South China Sea.


**Steady levels of inter and intra-state**
**tension**

The region is expected to remain relatively free of
internal tension in the short to medium term.
Where tension exists it is primarily a result of
overlapping maritime claims in the South China
Sea.


**Regional security architecture:**
**measured evolution**

The region’s main multilateral security fora have
emerged from the Association of South East
Asian Nations. They will continue to be aimed at
management, rather than the resolution, of
regional tensions in order to maintain consensus

Given the differences in national interests among
members, it is unlikely that the existing regional
architecture will develop into a more integrated
community along the lines of North Atlantic Treaty
Organisation in the short to medium term.

### 2.7. SOUTH ASIA

Increasing strategic importance

136. South Asia is dominated by India, one of
the world’s rising economic powers. By 2025
India is expected to have supplanted Japan as
the third largest economy and will have
overtaken China to be the most world’s populous
state. Its continued economic growth and
associated military modernisation means that it
will play an increasingly important role in the
Indian Ocean and, potentially, further afield in
South East Asia.

137. With the world’s busiest trade route now
running through the Middle East, the Indian
Ocean and into South East Asia, maritime
security in the region is taking on increasing
importance to a number of major actors, including India, the United States, Australia,
China, and Indonesia. New Zealand too has an interest in the maintenance of a stable
trade route through the region.

138. In keeping with India’s rapidly increasing regional and global influence – and
growing two-way trade – New Zealand is seeking to strengthen its bilateral relationship
with India. This includes growing our defence links.

**2.7.1. SLOW BUT STEADY MILITARY MODERNISATION**

139. India is in the process of improving its military projection capabilities through the
acquisition of advanced submarines, new and second hand aircraft carriers, and maritime
surveillance and stealth aircraft platforms. Along with its traditional security concerns
around Pakistan, these acquisitions are being driven by the increasing military capability of
its neighbours and other major powers in the wider Asian region.

**2.7.2. SIGNIFICANT MEDIUM TERM SECURITY RISKS**

140. Pakistan’s security remains a serious concern. Ageing infrastructure, high
population growth and unemployment, a resilient anti-government insurgency, and
ungoverned territory allowing the residence of Al-Qaeda senior leaders, all point to
Pakistan as a medium to long-term risk to regional security. Afghanistan’s security is also
expected to degrade over the next decade as Western military support and international
aid declines.

141. Bangladesh has many of the same structural problems as Pakistan. As a densely
populated, very low-lying country, it is at particular risk over the longer term of suffering the
negative effects of sea level rise. If only a small percentage of its 157 million population
seeks to migrate it could have a significant impact on regional relations.

**2.7.3. SOUTH ASIA ASSESSMENT CONCLUSIONS**


**Increasing strategic importance**


South Asia is dominated by India, one of the
world’s rising powers. Its continued economic
growth and military modernisation means that it
will play an increasingly important role in the
Indian Ocean and, potentially, further afield in
South East Asia. New Zealand is currently
seeking to strengthen its bilateral relationship
with India. This includes growing our defence
links.

With the world’s busiest trade route now running
through the Middle East, the Indian Ocean and
into South East Asia, maritime security in the
region is taking on increasing importance.


**Slow but steady military**
**modernisation**

India is in the process of improving its military
projection capabilities. These acquisitions are
being driven by security concerns around
Pakistan and the increasing military capability of
its neighbours and other major powers in the
wider Asian region.


**Significant medium term security**
**risks**

Pakistan’s security and economic prospects
remains a serious concern. Afghanistan’s

security is also expected to degrade over the
next decade as Western military support and
international aid declines. Bangladesh has many
of the same structural problems as Pakistan. As
a densely populated, very low-lying country it is
at particular risk over the longer term of suffering
the negative effects of sea level rise.

### 2.8. NORTH AMERICA AND THE ARCTIC

Strengthening bilateral relations

142. The New Zealand – United States
relationship has steadily improved over the
past decade or more. It has also enabled a
deepening of New Zealand’s engagement in
the “Five-Eyes” network with the United States,
Australia, the United Kingdom and Canada.

**2.8.1. UNITED STATES GLOBAL**
**INFLUENCE: DECLINING YET STILL**
**PEERLESS OUT TO 2040**

143. The global influence of the United States
will continue to diminish in relative terms over
time, but from a high starting position. The
United States is likely to remain unparalleled in
its ability and willingness to use force, including the deployment of ground forces, if
required to directly protect national security.

144. The collapse of the Soviet Union in the early 1990s ushered in a period where
United States power was unrivalled, including the capacity to act militarily across the
globe. Out to 2040 it will remain the most powerful global actor due to its continued,
though steadily diminishing, military superiority; robust political institutions; an innovative
economy; extensive alliance relationships; vast energy reserves; and highly influential
cultural soft power.

145. The United States has shifted its counter-terrorism strategy towards the increasing
use of air strikes (primarily by remotely piloted aircraft); intelligence and military support to
local governments; and special forces operations, as demonstrated by the operation
against Osama Bin Laden in 2011.

146. There are no contenders in the next 25 years to replace the United States as the
world’s “indispensable nation” when it comes to international peace and security, including
ensuring freedom of navigation.

**2.8.2. THE ARCTIC THAW: OPENING UP NEW POSSIBILITIES**

147. United States interest in the Arctic region may increase in the future. Climate
change is causing polar sea ice to retreat, opening up previously inaccessible areas to oil
and gas exploration. Regular ice-free summers by 2045 may allow a new shipping route to
open up along the northern coast of Russia, reducing the cost and transit time of goods
travelling between North Asia and Europe, and decreasing the strategic importance of the
Suez Canal – Indian Ocean route. It would also increase the geo-strategic importance of
Russia to global trade.

148. Alongside the United States and Russia, Canada, Denmark, Norway, Iceland and
Greenland all have direct interests in the Arctic region. With some jockeying for position
already evident,[13] it is probable that the delineation of Exclusive Economic Zone and
continental shelf boundaries under United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea will
enable the peaceful settling of ownership of economic rights across the vast majority of
Arctic region. Nevertheless, the United States, Canada, Russia, Denmark and Norway are
increasing their respective military capabilities to operate in the Arctic region as a hedge
against potential conflict. Should relations between Russia and North Atlantic Treaty
Organisation states remain difficult due to the current conflict in the Ukraine, there is a
possibility it could spill over into other regions (see Europe section on page 53 for further
details).

North Pole.

**2.8.3. NORTH AMERICA AND THE ARCTIC ASSESSMENT CONCLUSIONS**


**Strengthening bilateral relations**

The New Zealand – United States relationship
has steadily improved over the past decade or
more, enabling a deepening of New Zealand’s
engagement in the “Five-Eyes” network with the
United States, Australia, the United Kingdom and
Canada.


**The Arctic thaw: opening up new**
**possibilities**

Climate change is causing polar sea ice to
retreat, opening up previously inaccessible areas
to oil and gas exploration. By 2045 this may allow
a new shipping route to open up along the
northern coast of Russia, decreasing the strategic
importance of the Suez Canal – Indian Ocean
route. It would also increase the geo-strategic
importance of Russia to global trade.


**United States willingness to use**
**military force**

The United States has shifted its counterterrorism strategy towards the increasing use of
air, military support to local governments, and
special forces operations.

The United States is likely to remain unparalleled
in its ability and willingness to use force, including
the deployment of ground forces, if required to
directly protect national security. It will retain the
ability to project military force across the globe.


**Increasing strategic importance of the**
**Arctic**

Alongside the United States and Russia, Canada,
Denmark, Norway, Iceland and Greenland all
have direct interests in the Arctic region. While it
is probable that the delineation of Exclusive
Economic Zone and continental shelf boundaries
will be settled peacefully, countries are increasing
their respective military capabilities to operate in
the Arctic region as a hedge against potential
conflict.

Should relations between Russia and North
Atlantic Treaty Organisation states continue to
decline due to conflict in the Ukraine, there is a
possibility that tension could spill over into the
Arctic region.


**United States global influence:**
**declining yet still peerless out to 2040**

Out to 2040 the United States will remain the
most powerful global actor due to its continued,
though steadily diminishing, military superiority;
robust political institutions; an innovative

economy; extensive alliance relationships; vast
energy reserves; and highly influential cultural
soft power.

### 2.9. EUROPE AND THE NORTH ATLANTIC TREATY
 ORGANISATION

New Zealand-European Union relations: holding steady

149. Although New Zealand, and much of the
rest of the world, is increasingly looking to expand
relations with growing Asian nations, our

relationship with many European states,

particularly the United Kingdom, remains

important. As a bloc, the European Union is our
second-largest regional trading partner, and we
retain shared historical links and a common
outlook on the importance of democracy, human
rights and the rule of law.

150. New Zealand’s defence engagement with
Europe is driven principally through our

engagement with the North Atlantic Treaty
Organisation, as well as the acquisition of military
equipment from European manufacturers.

**2.9.1. EUROPEAN UNION: DOWN BUT NOT OUT**

151. The Global Financial Crisis hit much of Europe particularly hard. Inequality,
unemployment and dissatisfaction with the existing political order has risen, with far right
and left wing political movements increasing in popularity. Economic underperformance is
also driving rising calls for independence or increased autonomy within European Union
states such as Spain, the United Kingdom, Greece and Belgium. There will be continued
pressure on many European Union member states to return certain responsibilities back to
state capitals but it is unlikely that the European Union will fracture or collapse.

**2.9.2. DEFENCE CUTS CRIMPING CAPABILITY**

152. Outside of Eastern Europe, defence budgets across the European Union are largely
static or falling. Since 2010 real defence spending has declined at a compound annual
growth rate of 1.9%, with reductions of 3.0% in 2011, 2.2% in 2012 and 2.4% in 2013.
Overall, real defence spending levels in 2013 were 7.4% lower than in 2010 (see Figure 26 over page).

153. Static or declining defence expenditure, accompanied in some cases by significant
cuts in capability is reducing European states’ ability to deploy its forces outside of Europe.
Despite these reductions, however, European Union nations retain some of the most
advanced military capabilities outside of the United States and Japan and will continue to
provide support to United Nations or United Nations-mandated peace support operations,
especially in countries close to Europe or former colonial possessions, such as Libya and
Mali.

**2.9.3. NORTH ATLANTIC TREATY ORGANISATION**


_Source: Europe,The Military Balance._


154. Since the collapse of the Soviet Union, the North Atlantic Treaty Organisation has
evolved from a traditional military alliance for collective defence into a politico-military
organisation for security cooperation with a large and complex bureaucracy. The
organisation has been able to remain relevant beyond the end of the Cold War due to its
ability to re-orient its strategic direction and the historically consistent commonality of
values and interests between North America and European states.

DEFENCE ASSESSMENT 2014 54


-----

155. There is debate over the North Atlantic Treaty Organisation’s core role given the
differing military requirements of defending its members’ territory compared with
contributing to peace support operations, tensions in relation to financial burden-sharing,
and the current drift of some of its member nations toward geopolitical introversion. Only
four of the organisation’s 28 members currently maintain the collectively agreed upon
defence-to-gross domestic product ratio of 2% or more (Turkey, the United States, France
and the United Kingdom).

156. Most of these challenges aren’t new: internal divisions, an over-reliance on
American resources and military funding discrepancies, have been problems since the
organisation’s creation. The 2011 air campaign in Libya exposed the dependence of
European alliance members’ on United States military support.

157. The North Atlantic Treaty Organisation will continue to forge partnerships with
external countries, both in order to augment and add greater legitimacy to its operations,
and to help distribute the financial burden of operations.

158. The North Atlantic Treaty Organisation–New Zealand relationship reinforces
bilateral relationships with many European nations while offering valuable defence training
opportunities. The relationship has been strengthened over the course of more than a
decade of joint operations in Afghanistan as well as counter-piracy activities around the
Horn of Africa. To maintain the bilateral relationship post Afghanistan, we signed an
Individual Partnership and Cooperation Programme arrangement in 2012.

**2.9.4. RUSSIA RESURGENT**

159. Russian actions in Ukraine are challenging the rules-based international order,
particularly the inviolability of a country’s national borders. It is demonstrating an
increasing willingness to use all levers of state power in the pursuit of its national interests.

160. United States–Russian tensions in relation to Syria, and United States–European
Union criticism of Russia’s actions in the Ukraine, are fuelling speculation of a new Cold
War between Russia and the West. This may represent a fundamental and long-lasting
degradation of relations between Russia and Western nations. Relations could further
deteriorate should the North Atlantic Treaty Organisation expand its membership to
include more of Russia’s neighbours, or Russia seeks to reclaim further territory (beyond
the Crimean peninsula) lost following the dissolution of the Soviet Union.

**2.9.5. EUROPE AND THE NORTH ATLANTIC TREATY ORGANISATION**

**ASSESSMENT CONCLUSIONS**


**New Zealand-European Union**
**relations: holding steady**

Our relationship with many European states,
particularly the United Kingdom, remains

important. As a bloc, the European Union is our
second-largest regional trading partner, and we
retain shared historical links and a common
outlook on the importance of democracy, human

that the European Union will fracture or collapse,
but economic underperformance is driving calls
for independence or increased autonomy within
European Union states such as Spain, the
United Kingdom and Belgium.


**Defence cuts crimping capability**

Static or declining defence expenditure, and in
some cases accompanied by significant cuts in
capability, is reducing European states’ ability to
deploy its forces outside of Europe. European
Union nations will, however, continue to provide
some support to United Nations or

United Nations-mandated peace support

operations, especially in countries close to
Europe or former colonial possessions, such as
Libya and Mali.


**North Atlantic Treaty Organisation**

There is internal debate over the North Atlantic
Treaty Organisation’s core role given the differing
military requirements of defending its members’
territory compared with contributing to peace
support operations and other security challenges.
The North Atlantic Treaty Organisation will
continue to forge partnerships with external
countries, both in order to augment and add

distribute the financial burden of operations.


**Russia resurgent**

Russian actions in Ukraine are challenging the

inviolability of a country’s national borders. This
may represent a fundamental and long-lasting
degradation of relations between Russia and
Western nations. Relations could further

deteriorate should the North Atlantic Treaty
Organisation expand its membership to include
more of Russia’s neighbours, or Russia seeks to

### 2.10. THE MIDDLE EAST AND NORTH AFRICA 

New Zealand interests steady

161. Outside of the Gulf Cooperation Council
countries – with whom relations are expanding on
the back of rapid economic growth – New Zealand’s
economic interests in the region are slim.

Nevertheless New Zealand has a strong strategic
interest given the disproportionate effect events in
the region have on international security and the
global economy.

**2.10.1** **CONTINUED CONFLICT**

162. The Middle East and North Africa has
undergone significant political change in the last five
years, with limited political reform in Morocco;
changes in regime in Tunisia, Libya, Yemen, and
Egypt (twice); and civil war in Syria, Iraq and Yemen. The region’s stability matters to the
rest of the world because of its oil and gas production, the strategic importance of the
Suez Canal to world trade, and the impact of terrorism.

163. There are a number of common, underlying factors driving political change in the
region although they vary in their extent in each country: high population growth and
unemployment; falling real incomes; corruption; scarcity of food, water and energy;
cultural, ethnic and religious discrimination; and state borders that ignore traditional tribal
boundaries.

164. With the underlying causes of instability and conflict in the region remaining largely
unaddressed, it is highly likely that the region will face further conflict and turmoil over the
assessment period.

**2.10.2. CHALLENGES TO STATE BOUNDARIES**

165. Two related developments in 2014 are significant for their potential future impact on
the region. The declaration of an Islamic Caliphate by the Islamic State of Iraq and the
Levant across territory in Syria and Iraq is the first time any group in the region has at least
temporarily been able to re-draw the political boundaries established by the allied powers
at the end of WWI and following the break up of the Ottoman Empire.

166. The Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant’s takeover of north-western Iraq has
enabled long held ambitions in Iraqi Kurdistan to take control of Kurdish-majority territory,
including the oil-rich region around Kirkuk. The Kurds in Syria are also building a basis for
autonomy.

DEFENCE ASSESSMENT 2014 57


-----

**2.10.3. MORE TERRITORY FOR TERRORIST GROUPS**

167. The conflict in Syria and Iraq is accelerating the shift, already underway, in the
centre of gravity of Sunni Islamist terrorism from Pakistan to the Middle East and North
Africa. There is now more freedom for the training and planning of terrorist attacks on
Western targets, and in an area much closer geographically to Europe.

168. The conflict has attracted large numbers of Western volunteers seeking to fight on
the side of their choice. Their potential radicalisation, combined with any military training or
experience received there, could increase the risk of extremism and terrorism in their
countries of origin should they return.

**2.10.4. RECEDING PROSPECTS FOR THE MIDDLE EAST PEACE PROCESS**

169. Regime change and conflict across the region has increased Israel’s threat
perceptions, lessening the likelihood of any progress between Israel and the Palestinian
Authority on moving towards a permanent two-state solution. Continued settlement
building in East Jerusalem and the West Bank is making an economically sustainable,
contiguous Palestinian state even less likely over time.

**2.10.5. ONGOING IRANIAN NUCLEAR NEGOTIATIONS**

170. An outline agreement relating to Iran’s nuclear capability was made in April 2015,
although it remains a possibility that a final, comprehensive agreement will not be
concluded. If negotiations fail and Iran were to declare a nuclear weapons capability, other
states in the region could seek to develop or acquire such a capability themselves. If this
were to occur it would have severely negative repercussions for global security.

**2.10.6. MIDDLE EAST AND NORTH AFRICA ASSESSMENT CONCLUSIONS**


**New Zealand interests**


**Continued conflict**


Outside of the Gulf Cooperation Council

countries, New Zealand’s economic interests in
the region are slim. Nevertheless New Zealand
has a strong strategic interest given the
disproportionate effect events in the region have
on international security and the global economy.


The region has undergone significant political
change in the last five years, with limited political
reform in Morocco; changes in regime in Tunisia,
Libya, Yemen, and Egypt (twice); and civil war in
Syria and Iraq.

There are a number of factors driving political
change in the region, including high population
growth and unemployment, falling real incomes,
corruption, scarcity of food, water and energy,
cultural, ethnic and religious discrimination, and
state borders that ignore traditional tribal

boundaries. With the underlying causes of
instability and conflict in the region remaining
largely unaddressed, it is highly likely that the
region will face further conflict and turmoil over
the assessment period.


**More territory for terrorist groups**


There is now more freedom for the training and
planning of terrorist attacks on Western targets.
The radicalisation of foreign fighters, is increasing
the risk of extremism and terrorism in their
countries of origin upon their return, including
New Zealand.


**Receding prospects for the Middle**
**East Peace Process**

Regime change and conflict across the region
has increased Israel’s threat perceptions,

lessening the chance of any progress between
Israel and the Palestinian Authority on moving
towards a permanent two-state solution.


**Implications for New Zealand peace**
**support operations**

The risk to Defence Force personnel in both the
United Nations Truce Supervision Organisation
and the Multinational Force and Observers
mission has increased over the past five years. It
is likely that the security situation will remain
highly unstable over the assessment period.

### 2.12. SUB-SAHARAN AFRICA

Small but rising New Zealand interest

171. Sub-Saharan Africa spans desert,

savannah, jungle and temperate climates, with a
total population of 936 million people spread
across 49 countries. New Zealand’s relations with
most African nations are sparse, based on
Commonwealth and sporting ties and our

longstanding development, humanitarian and

peace support assistance. Although our trade with
the region remains modest, exports have

increased steadily over the past 15 years and are
expected to continue to do so. This is likely to
increase the importance to New Zealand of the
Indian Ocean trade routes. New Zealand can
expect continued requests for niche contributions
to existing and new peace support operations in the region.

**2.12.1. DECREASING INTER-STATE CONFLICT, CONTINUED INTRA-STATE**

**CONFLICT**

172. Approximately 80% of all currently deployed United Nations personnel operate in
Sub-Saharan Africa and 60% of all current United Nations missions are located there.

There has been a steady decline in inter-state conflict in the region over the last few
decades. This is expected to continue out to 2040, although some areas are likely to
remain contested, such as between Sudan and South Sudan and between Ethiopia and
Eritrea.

173. Despite this, intra-state conflict, complicated by the involvement of external actors,
is expected to continue to be the primary type of conflict generating instability across the
region. The majority of new United Nations operations over the assessment period are
expected to be in Sub-Saharan Africa.

**2.12.2. POSITIVE AND NEGATIVE INDICATORS**

174. The Sub-Saharan region is undergoing rapid change. With some of the highest
population growth rates in the world, its population is likely to double between now and
2045, exceeding China’s working age population in 2030 and India’s in 2035. Much of this
population growth will occur in urban areas, with most cities struggling to provide basic
services. Economic growth has been uneven; strong in some countries (such as Angola)
but weak or non-existent in others.

175. Overall the region presents a mixed picture. Governance is improving in many
countries, with an overall shift towards representative government, while others backslide.
Corruption and poor governance remain serious problems, though the number of coup
d’état per decade decreased from 20 between 1960 and 2000 to six between 2000 and
2010. The region is expected to continue to make progress due to improved health and
education, higher incomes, stronger civil societies, better access to information via growth
in information and communication access, and the growing empowerment of women.

DEFENCE ASSESSMENT 2014 60


-----

Regional organisations, particularly the African Union, have also increased their capacity
to address security challenges.

176. The region remains highly vulnerable. It includes 14 of the world’s most fragile
states (out of the top 20).[14] Many countries already face energy, water and food shortages.
These are likely to become more pronounced in some areas due to high population
growth, lowering water tables, higher temperatures, increasingly intense droughts and
floods, declining agricultural productivity, and changing rainfall patterns. Friction over
resources, for example, accounted for 35% of all conflict in the region during 2010-2011.
Instability and conflict may increase in some areas for these reasons as well as
unemployment, unfulfilled expectations, rising inequality and the influence radicalising
ideologies and groups. The risk of terrorism may also increase for these reasons.

**2.12.3. PIRACY OFF THE AFRICAN COASTLINE**

177. Since their peak in 2011, attacks by Somali-based pirates have declined markedly.
This downward trend is attributable to the combined deterrent effect of the presence of
multilateral counter-piracy operations – such as the United States-led Combined Maritime
Force and the North Atlantic Treaty Organisation’s Operation Ocean Shield, which the
Defence Force has contributed to – and the increasing prevalence of armed security
teams aboard seagoing vessels. As a result, the overall cost of Somali piracy is down by
almost 50% (from US$5.7 billion in 2012 to $3 billion in 2013).

178. If efforts to combat piracy decline, or the capability of Somali pirates significantly
increases, this trend could reverse. The underlying causes of piracy – fisheries depletion,
poverty, weak governance and the absence of rule of law – are not expected to be
addressed substantively over the assessment period, despite the gradual emergence of
capacity building efforts ashore.

179. Piracy off the Western coast of Africa, primarily around the Gulf of Guinea, is
increasing. For the past two years there have been more attacks in this region than in East
Africa, including 42 hostage-taking attacks and 58 attempts at robbery. Although the
region does not have the same strategic importance as East Africa (with its crucial trade
route through the Suez Canal and on to Asia) 30% of oil destined for the United States and
40% for Europe passes through the region.

180. If the piracy problem escalates and supplies are substantially disrupted, it is
possible that international attention could intensify and multilateral counter-piracy
operations be considered.

14 These are, in descending order: South Sudan, Somalia, Central African Republic, Democratic Republic of
Congo, Sudan, Chad, Zimbabwe, Guinea, Cote D’Ivoire, Guinea Bissau, Nigeria, Kenya, Ethiopia, and Niger.

**2.12.4** **SUB-SAHARAN AFRICA ASSESSMENT CONCLUSIONS**


**Small but rising New Zealand interest**

New Zealand’s relations with most African
nations are sparse, based on Commonwealth
and sporting ties and our longstanding

development, humanitarian and peace support
assistance. New Zealand can expect continued
requests for niche contributions to existing and
new peace support operations.


**Decreasing inter-state conflict,**
**continued intra-state conflict**

There has been a steady decline in inter-state
conflict in the region over the last few decades.
This is expected to continue out to 2040. Intrastate conflict, complicated by the involvement of
external actors, is expected to continue to be the
primary type of conflict generating instability
across the region. The majority of new

United Nations operations are expected to be in
Sub-Saharan Africa over the assessment period.


**Positive and negative indicators**

Overall the region presents a mixed picture.
Governance is improving in many countries, with
an overall shift towards representative

government, while others backslide. Corruption
and poor governance remain serious problems.
Much of the region remains highly vulnerable,
particularly in areas facing energy, water and
food shortages.


**Piracy off the African coastline**

Attacks by Somali-based pirates are declining
due to presence of multilateral counter-piracy
operations and the increasing prevalence of
armed security teams aboard seagoing vessels. If
efforts to combat piracy decline, or the capability
of Somali pirates significantly increases, the
downward trend could reverse as the underlying
causes of piracy are not being substantively
addressed.

Piracy off the Western coast of Africa, primarily
around the Gulf of Guinea, is increasing.
