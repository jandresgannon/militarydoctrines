###### PRESIDENT OF UKRAINE, SUPREME COMMANDER- IN-CHIEF OF THE ARMED FORCES OF UKRAINE: DEFENCE POLICY OF THE STATE

A State can be strong, stable and secure only when it has a strong Armed Forces. This
idea is vital for any epoch, country or people. The Armed Forces always was and is
a basic, fundamental element of national security.
Our goal is to create modern highly-professional Armed Forces able effectively and
adequately to respond to any threat to the sovereignty and territorial integrity of Ukraine.
Training, equipping and provision of all necessary resources to the Armed Forces and
the legal framework should meet the standards of the Euro-Atlantic community. Our
State is an important participant of this Euro-Atlantic space.
It is sad to realize that due to minimal resources provided in 2009 it was not the
year of further development and improvement. The Armed Forces never had such a low
Defence Budget – 1.0% of GDP – during the last 18 years.
Despite the financial challenges the Armed Forces managed to maintain an adequate
level of combat readiness. We conducted large-scale exercises that proved the high
professionalism of Ukrainian Service personnel. The total number of Armed Forces that
participated in exercises reached 14,000 personnel at one time.
The Special Operations Forces – a new Armed Service - was founded and continues
to develop.
The Joint Operational Command proved its ability and readiness to successfully
direct joint forces. This is a very important step on the way to establishing new, in
principal, national Armed Forces. I am convinced that we have chosen the right way to
reform the Armed Forces. I highly appreciate the results.
The strategic course of our State aimed at full integration with the North Atlantic
Treaty Organization remains unchanged.
We realize that in modern conditions any state can have guarantees of its sovereignty
only in the frame of effective collective security systems. We continue to work to
expand our cooperation with the Alliance.


-----

Last year Ukraine started to get ready for membership in the North Atlantic Treaty
Organization in accordance with the new Annual National Programme which is very
close to the NATO Membership Action Plan in its structure and essence. Cooperation
with the military structures of the European Union has gained an enhanced qualitative
nature.
As of today our Armed Forces take an active part in strengthening international
security. Our State is among the 20 most active peace-keeping nations. Since
Independence some 34,000 Armed Forces’ personnel participated in 18 international
peace-keeping missions and operations.
The Armed Forces has become a reliable pillar of the Ukrainian State in defending
its citizens. Service personnel were among the first to help the population to overcome
the results of man-made disasters and large-scale emergencies on Ukrainian territory.
I am sure that our Armed Forces are strong today and I am confident they will
become stronger tomorrow!
I express gratitude to the Armed Forces, each soldier and officer. I wish happiness,
health, inspiration and new successes in the service of Ukraine and Ukrainian people.

The President of Ukraine –
The Supreme Commander-in-Chief
of the Armed Forces of Ukraine
Viktor YUSHCHENKO

###### OPENING ADDRESS OF THE ACTING MINISTER OF DEFENCE OF UKRAINE

The Ministry Defence publishes The White Book 2009 in accordance with the legally
recognized functions of civil control of the Armed Forces.
This is the 5th annual publication that has been recognized as an effective mechanism
to provide openness and accountability of the Armed Forces to Ukrainian society.
2009 was one of the most difficult years in the whole history of the Armed Forces
based on the tasks assigned and resources provided. The reduced Budget slowed the
process of implementing the “State Programme of Development of the Armed Forces
of Ukraine 2006-2011”. It also significantly influenced personnel training, unit combat
training, and coordination of military command and control agencies. At the same time
adopting a number of State decisions in the sphere of defence, focusing on separate
priority directions as well as the dedicated work of the entire Armed Forces personnel
made it possible to cope this arduous period.
The Armed Forces ensured the defence of air space and the most important State
infrastructure installations; technical readiness of equipment of Joint Rapid Reaction
Forces’ units; and, an adequate level of personnel knowledge and skills to accomplish
tasks.
We continue to work on upgrading the Armed Forces’ command and control
system, introducing new items of communication equipment, computerization and data
protection.
Despite all the problems the process of professionalization in the Armed Forces
continued. The military education system has been improved to create a number of
military educational institutions which meet the requirements of the Armed Forces’
structure and tasks. The transition to a three-level personnel management system
has been completed. Generally accepted, transparent and understandable personnel
decisions on all categories of Service personnel are now being taken.
The Sergeants’ training system is being fundamentally changed in military training
units (centres) and military education institutions of all Arms of the Armed Forces.
The newly-created military colleges provide professional education at 3 levels:
Basic, Intermediate and Advanced. During the last year 1,400 professional sergeants
were educated, 97 of whom passed the Intermediate and Advanced levels.


-----

We realize the priority of providing resources to renew equipment of the highlytechnological Arms of the Armed Forces. Last year additional mechanisms were created
to modernize, repair and maintain aviation equipment. Work on development of new
items of military equipment has been intensified. Such items include a multi-functional
missile system, a new corvette class ship and the military transport aircraft AN-70. The
Ministry of Defence has been updating legal, financial, technical and organizational
procedures to deliver these projects.
Our Peace-keepers show courage and determination, a high level of humanity far
away from the Motherland, thus contributing to Ukraine’s international reputation.
During last year 4 rotations of peace-keeping contingents and 50 rotations of peacekeeping Service personnel were conducted. In total 1,096 Service personnel participated
in peace-keeping operations and missions in 8 countries.
Last year during the global financial crisis, the Ukrainian Armed Forces witnessed
strong support from social organizations that contribute to the defence process and
patriotic education of young people. A number of events in the Armed Forces aimed
at strengthening the State’s defence capabilities have been carried out with the help of
sponsorship and charitable support from people and organizations.
Summarizing the Armed Forces’ activity in 2009 we can firmly state that the Armed
Forces is able to fulfil its main constitutional task to defend the State sovereignty,
territorial integrity and inviolability of the state borders of Ukraine.
We expect challenging and intense work in the future. We have to restore last year’s
“Crisis” losses to the Armed Forces’ combat readiness, improving the command and
control system, all functional structures of the Forces, military equipment, the system
of material and technical support, and social protection of Service personnel and their
families.

The acting Minister
of Defence of Ukraine

###### OPENING ADDRESS OF THE CHIEF OF THE GENERAL STAFF [–] COMMANDER IN CHIEF OF THE ARMED FORCES OF UKRAINE

The White Book 2009 is an annual publication that traditionally highlights
achievements and systemic changes in the Armed Forces and their perspective future
directions. These are tied with the balance between the requirements of combat
capability and combat readiness and daily requirements of their overall support,
improving the systems of command and control, training, manning and social
protection of personnel.
It is obvious that resolution of these important issues goes on openly and
transparently in the framework of democratic and civilian control of the State. The main
aim of Armed Forces’ development is the creation of small-in-strength, well-equipped,
well-trained, professional military. However, the ongoing financial and economic crisis
significantly influenced achieving this goal. Taking this into consideration the last year
was not an easy for the Armed Forces.
Significant limits in the Defence Budget negatively effected the modern equipment
procurement programme, Forces’ training and comprehensive support. In such
conditions, the General Staff and Service Commands introduced major adjustments to
activities.
The main efforts were focused on retaining the combat potential of the Armed Forces,
preventing the development of damaging processes, maintaining technical functioning
of equipment, ensuring safety and sustainability of armaments and ammunition arsenals,
bases and depots, avoiding reduction of professional level of military personnel and
manning levels. Additional attention was paid to development of realistic plans of using
the Forces.
Taking into consideration significant limits in the Defence Budget the primary
directions of the General staff and the Services’ activity were defined as follows:
improving command and control, as well as overall support systems, creating a
single automatic command and control system; changing the military communication
system to a digital one, upgrading capabilities of the Air Force and the Navy, fulfilling
international commitments of Ukraine in the military sphere, enhancing the level of
cooperation with neighbouring States, including the Russian Federation.


-----

In the difficult financial conditions the leadership of the Armed Forces focused
on retaining high moral among Service personnel, retaining the number of officers
and encouraging social optimism. The effectiveness of this work was facilitated by
implementing the Personnel Policy Concept, introducing a new personnel management
system, separating Officers and Contract Service Personnel as a single direction, and
increasing humanitarian and social protection.
Improving the system of Officers multi-level training continued. Service military
institutes were transformed into military academies. A new system of Non-Commissioned
Officers’ training at training centres and Services’ military education institutions was
introduced. The Military Sergeants’ Training College is the highest level in the new
system. Today, we have already witnessed the right choice for the strategy for sergeants’
training.
Transformation of the combat training system has been initiated. This work should
result in the introduction of new approaches to combat training that combines Land, Air
and Sea training with a wide use of simulators.
International peace-keeping continues to be an important activity for the Armed
Forces. In 2009 the number of Armed Forces’ units and personnel participating in
peace-keeping operations was sustained. Providing evidence that Ukraine is and will
be a reliable contributor to international security - a predicable and consistent partner.
On the whole, the Armed Forces due to the actions taken retained combat capability,
the integrity of air and territorial defence, and the ability to respond adequately to
the most important threats to national security of the State in the military field. This
is due to the diligent work of commanders at different levels and all Armed Forces’
personnel.
Our State continues to create modern Armed Forces of a European model.
Undoubtedly, the dynamic process of improving and developing the State’s Armed
Forces requires the involvement of political-military, economic, social and moral
potential of the State. This is complex and responsible work for State Power agencies,
local government institutions, non-governmental organizations, each General and
Admiral, Officer, Non-Commissioned Officer, Soldier and Seaman. The guaranteed level
of our State’s defence capability and the effectiveness and efficiency of accomplishing
its constitutional tasks by the Armed Forces depends on that mentioned above.

Commander-in-Chief of the Armed Forces of Ukraine,

General of the Army of Ukraine

 SUMMARY OF DEVELOPMENT OF THE ARMED FORCES OF UKRAINE IN 2009

he main task of the Ministry of Defence (MOD) and the General Staff (GS) in 2009 was to ensure
defence of the State, the protection of its sovereignty and territorial integrity. Special attention was
## T
given to retaining the combat potential of the Armed Forces, maintaining combat capability to the
operational readiness of air defence, and ensuring the daily support of the Armed Forces.


FULFILMENT
OF THE STATE
PROGRAMME FOR
THE DEVELOPMENT
OF THE ARMED
FORCES


Resource limitations had significant impact on the fulfillment of the State Programme
for the Development of the Armed Forces 2006 - 2011 (hereinafter – the State
Programme). Due to objective reasons fulfilling key activities under the State
Programme slowed throughout the year. However, the expansion of destructive processes in the Forces was avoided and the potential for continuation of reform in the
future has been retained.

Development of the Command
and Control System of the Armed Forces

The initiation of the development of the system of information security of the
State in the defence field has become the most important achievement of the year.
The Doctrine of the information security support of Ukraine[1] was approved by the
President in July starting the work in the Armed Forces on establishing the chain of
command in the system of information security support.
The coordinating authorities between the Cabinet of Ministers and the MOD were
intensified. The coordination of the structure of MOD Head Office with the First VicePrime Minister has become obligatory.[2]

The operational capabilities of the Joint Operational Command were increased
throughout the year. It is presently capable of carrying out command and control over
the force formations.
**The work on the establishment of the automated command and control system**
**of the Armed Forces continued. Its perspective structure, stages and development**
sequence were defined. The separate elements of this system were implemented within
the financial support provided. At the same time, the overall rate of transition to the
modern data telecommunication means remains low (3.2% per year).
This factor has slowed down the fulfillment of several planned activities under
the State Programme, restraining the rearrangement of the Service Commands into
Service HQs, the formation of the Air Force military command, control, and notification
structures, and improvement of the command and control system over logistics
support.

SUMMARY OF DEVELOPMENT OF THE ARMED FORCES OF UKRAINE IN 2009

Improving Personnel Policy

The main efforts were targeted on implementing the personnel policy principles,
supporting the current level of personnel support and prevention of the outflow of
professionally-prepared Service personnel from military service.

The Armed Forces’ Personnel Policy Concept in 2009 enabled the implementation
of the centralized personnel management system from 1[st] January 2010, directed
to the personnel support of Forces assistance in personal development, and to
realize potential, and a clear understanding of the career perspective by each Service
individual.

The work of 25 **Territorial Contract Manning**
**Centres was intensified throughout the year defining**
officials’ personal responsibility for ensuring the proper
quality of candidates for active service on the contract
basis.

The new system of manning on the contract basis
was introduced according to the following Diagram:
the Territorial Manning Centres – Training Military
Unit (Centre) – Military Unit. This allowed a certain
level of control over the enlistment process, saving 1.63.5 thousand UAH for each military individual spent
on training (depending on the duration of training –
1.5-3 months) that was achieved by simplifying the
enlistment process.

**The list of individuals eligible for Contact service**
**was expanded in 2009.** [3] At present the following
individuals who have passed professional, psychological selection and meet the
requirements of military service are enlisted for active service as an Enlisted or NCOs:
servicemen conscripted – after three months of service (earlier – after six months);
conscription age individuals with higher, professional or complete senior secondary
education (earlier – not provided) without active service experience; commandeered
individuals and women aged 18 to 40 years without officer rank with the corresponding
education and special training.
Special attention was given to the establishing a strong Non-Commissioned
**Officer Corps because its structure is one of the basic features of modern, professional**
Armed Forces. The multi-level training system of NCOs was introduced. The military
educational institutions network includes 3 Military Colleges and 14 Service and Branch
Training Centres.


**Diagram 1.1 The level of support of the servicemen with the service**
housing, places


Measures were taken to increase the motivation and
**attractiveness of military service through providing**
contract Service personnel with Service housing.
218 “Block Sections” for the accommodation of over
700 Service personnel of this category (diagram 1.1)
became operational during the year. The total number
of Service housing provided from 2006 to 2009
was 2,262.

At the same time the insufficient level of military
remuneration, failure to provide the publicly declared
benefits and guarantees for Service personnel and their
families have made military service uncompetitive in
the 2009 labour market.

chapter 1


**Table 1.1. The comparison of the upkeep cost of army conscript and**
servicemen serving on the contract basis serving on the position of
the marksman per year, UAH


The present upkeep cost of a conscript serving in the
position of marksman is practically equal to the cost of
a Contract Service individual in the first year of service
in the same position (Table 1.1).

At the same time it was possible to keep military
service attractive to youth who consider the Armed
Forces as the school of courage, the chance to reveal
one’s best leadership qualities and become a real
professional.

The results of sociological researches show that
the positive attitude to military service prevails over
negative perceptions to it. The overwhelming majority
of respondents consider service in the Armed Forces
as the “school-of-life” (44.6%), possibility to become
physically and morally fit (43.9 %), and possibility for
self-realization (13.7%).

|Category|Marksman, army conscript|Marksman, servicemen serving on the contract basis|
|---|---|---|


The negative answers included a waste of time (6.1 %), threat to life and health
(2.4 %) and separation from family (2.5 %).[4]

**The system of military education and science was improved. Strong**
Service scientific-education centres with education (Faculties and Departments in
Academies, and NCOs Colleges) and scientific sub-sections (scientific centres)
were established. This allowed the concentration of training, re-training and
career development of military experts at all levels of the military command and
control structure in single training bases, providing the integration of military education
and science and reducing the required budgetary allocation. In 2009 a total of 1,300
Service personnel at Operation-Strategic, Operation-Tactical and Tactical levels was
trained.

**The level of training of the Joint Rapid Reaction Forces in previous years was**
**maintained in 2009. The allocated financial resources were concentrated on the major**
directions to support the level of training of aircrews involved in providing air cover to
key national installations and Immediate Reaction Forces.

This allowed flying experience of the Air Force of 18.2 hours per crew, Land Force
12 hours and Naval Aviation 28.3 hours, battle ship’s crew experience 9.4 days, to fulfill
the air-borne training programme with a total of 15.4 thousand jumps, and to conduct
the minimum number of tactical level exercises (Table 1.2).

chapter 1


SUMMARY OF DEVELOPMENT OF THE ARMED FORCES OF UKRAINE IN 2009

In spite of the sixfold reduction in the level of financial support to combat training
compared to 2008, the training efficiency of units has decreased by a quarter only.
Thus the relative share of high-quality and expensive forms of training represents a
half of those conducted in the previous year.
**Financial and material support allocations defined by the State for contact**
**Service personnel does not stimulate the transition to contract and did not allow**
**the increase in the level of Armed Forces manning of this category. At the same**
**time the number of contract Service personnel retained was maintained at 51 %**
**throughout the year.**
**The transition of the Armed Forces to contract manning was deferred to 2015**
**keeping in mind these objective reasons.[6]**

Humanitarian and social activity

The main efforts of humanitarian and social support were concentrated to improve
**military-patriotic education, by increasing the level of moral, psychological supp-**
ort of Armed Forces’ personnel, and improving the personnel recognition system to
achieve high results in official activities, reduction of accidents, crimes, traumatism
and death.
The efficiency of military-patriotic education was supported by:

              - the high level of trust of society to the Armed Forces despite problems of
objective and subjective nature;

               - the commitment of the State and local government representatives, education and
scientific institutions, and public organizations in cooperation with the Armed
Forces.
The **cooperation of military command and control agencies with non-**
**governmental organizations** **has improved throughout the year. The total number of**
non-governmental organizations, trade-union organizations, and mass-media comprises
84. Over 10,000 military-patriotic and cultural activities marking State and professional
holidays, memorable and significant dates, and events were conducted in cooperation
with State and local government bodies and non-governmental organizations.
The activities directed to eliminate religious contradictions in the Armed Forces
have become systematic. The mechanisms for the support of religious requirements of
Service personnel were defined. The Pastoral Support Council was established in the
MOD. The Council is represented by seven religions: the Ukrainian Orthodox Church,
the Ukrainian Orthodox Church of Kyiv Patriarchy, the Ukrainian Greco-Catholic
Church, Roman-Catholic Church in Ukraine, Ukrainian
Autocephalous Orthodox Church, the All-Ukrainian
union of the evangelic Christians-Baptists and Spiritual
leadership of Moslems in Ukraine.
**The Council of the families of Service personnel**
was established for the purpose of rendering assistance
in carrying out effective State policy regarding family,
gender equality, and subsequent rallying of military
groups of the Armed Forces.[7]

Purposeful educational work has enabled improvement
**in military discipline, to reduce the number of offences**
by 9 % in comparison to 2008, and to decrease the number
of fatalities among Service personnel by 1.3 times
(Diagram 1.2, 1.3).

The objectives set for social and professional adaptation of Service personnel to
civilian life were not reached because of insufficient resources provided in 2009. At the
same time, successful cooperation with the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO),
the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE), and Norway proceeds
within the framework of international projects and programmes that fund the re-training
of Service personnel to civil specialisms in Ukraine.
The professional training of 2,526 Service personnel in civil specialisms (116
training groups, 44 specialtisms in 32 education institutions) (Appendix 1) was carried
out within the framework of these international programmes and projects throughout
the year.

Disposal of rockets and ammunition


Low disposal rates of rockets and ammunition not suitable for further use and storage
are constraining the fulfillment of activities to optimize combat and numerical
strength of the Armed Forces and increase the combat potential of units, through
additional expenses on the maintenance of surplus military structures.
Only 6 rocket and ammunition storage centres out of 16 arsenals, bases, and
warehouses not listed in the future structure of the Armed Forces (Diagram 1.4) were
disbanded between 2006 and 2009.

by the MOD from military units for the purpose of
further disposal was 23.1 thousand tons, with 14.2 thousand tons being transferred to
the Ministry of Industrial Policy and 0.5 thousand tons to the National Space Agency.
The ammunition disposal indicators for 2006-2009 are provided in Table 1.3.

Disposal of propellants

The disposal process of liquid propellants is closely connected to the disposal of rockets though these substances are stored separately and a separate set of organizational activities is involved ns their disposal. About 15.5 thousand tons of excessive
and sub-standard mélange type oxidizers for propellant fuel are stored in six rocket
fuel storage Armed Forces’ bases. Five of these bases are to be disbanded by the end
of 2015.
The work on attracting international assistance for the disposal of propellants
was initiated by the Armed Forces in 2005 and continued in 2009.
On 16 September 2009 an international contract was concluded between the MOD,
the Secretary of the OSCE and enterprises of the Russian Federation on granting
services connected with the disposal of 3.2 thousand tons of mélange on fulfillment of
the Memorandum of Mutual Understanding between the Cabinet of Ministers and the
OSCE concerning the OSCE-Ukraine project on mélange disposal (liquid rocket fuel
component).[9]

The donor countries of the OSCE-Ukraine project on mélange disposal were Sweden,
Denmark, Finland, Germany, Norway, Poland, Spain and the Czech Republic.
Only 1.27 million UAH (50%) out of 2.5 million UAH provided in the Special Fund
of the 2009 State Budget was received as the financial support of the activities directed
to dispose of propellants and spent on repair of mélange transport shipping material
and payment for its transportation through the territory of Ukraine on fulfillment of
the international obligations of Ukraine within the framework of the abovementioned
project.
**470 tons of mélange were disposed of throughout the year by enterprises of the**
Russian Federation within the framework of the contract concluded with the winners
of international tender (Table 1.5).

Land Force form the basis of the combat power of the Ukrainian Armed Forces considering their number of tasks and manpower. They play the decisive role in fulfilling
the majority of Armed Forces’ tasks. Taking into account the role of the land component in current armed conflicts and the urgent need to preserve the level of personnel

SUMMARY OF DEVELOPMENT OF THE ARMED FORCES OF UKRAINE IN 2009


chapter 1


The key priorities in the development of Land Force in 2009 were:

                - preparing Ukrainian peace-keepers for tasks outside of Ukraine;

                 - maintaining combat efficiency of the materiel and gradual re-equipping of troops,
beginning with the Joint Rapid Reaction Forces, with the new items compatible
with NATO standards;

                - modernizing the command and control system and establishing preconditions for
the transition to the digital integrated communications network;

               - training the troops using computer-based forms and methods with the maximum
use of possibilities of the specialized training centres;

                 - increasing the theoretical level of personnel training.
By the end of 2009 the structure and effective combat strength of the Land Force
were balanced with regards to the functionality of military structure and command and

**Appendix 1.1. Effective combat strength of the Land Force** control system (Appendix 1.1).

The number of Land Force’s combat arms

4% peace-keeping operations throughout the year providing

fulfillment of tasks of the 56[th] Separate Helicopter
Detachment of the United Nations Mission in Liberia and the Ukrainian component of
the UKRPOLBAT in Kosovo.
The transformation of the training system has been initiated. It is based on deep
analysis of principles and methods for the organization of training of troops in Armed
Forces of the World’s leading countries, lessons learned from peace-keeping operations,
and national peculiarities. Taking into consideration the objective and subjective factors
associated with the transformation processes in the Ukrainian Armed Forces as a whole
any immediate result is not expected. In 2009 a long-term plan of transformation of
personnel training was introduced providing in particular: familiarization with the
training experience of different Armed Forces, increase in the share of highly-effective
activities, and gradual transition to the specialization of training activities.
The adoption of new items of equipment from 2006 to 2009 has enabled an increase
in combat potential, field training, and personnel skills.
The 350 pieces of equipment within Land Force were updated (Table 1.6) through
procurement and modernization.

FULFILMENT RESULTS
OF THE TASKS
PROVIDED IN THE
STRATEGIC DEFENCE
REVIEW


In order to develop planning assumptions regarding for long-term and medium-term
planning of the development process of the Armed Forces and other military formations the Strategic Defence Review (SDR) involving 16 Ministries and Departments
of the security and defence sector was continued.
The overall oversight of the SDR process is conducted by the Cabinet of Ministers
and in particular by the SDR Inter-Agency Commission headed by the First Vice-Prime
Minister.
The Inter-Agency Commission has a working body - the Analytical Group – that
monitors, studies, analyzes and evaluates information, prepares the sessions of the InterAgency Commission, and reports on its activity. It is headed by the Director of the
Institute of National Security Problems under the National Security Defence Council.
The Commission of Experts comprising the Organization Analytical Group and five
working groups deals with SDR on behalf of the MOD (Diagram 1.7).
The working groups have prepared information and analytical material, in
particular:

  - estimation of the security environment, definition of challenges and threats to
Ukraine;

  - purposes and tasks of the Armed Forces and other non-Armed Forces military
formations;

  - scenarios to use the Armed Forces, necessary capability requirements under all
scenarios and planning of the necessary resource support;

  - estimation of available capabilities of the Armed Forces, other non-Armed
Forces military formations, definition of the capability requirements and resource
support to fulfil defence tasks.
National and foreign experts as well as representatives of non-governmental public
organizations were involved in SDR activities. The course of the SDR was highlighted
in the media.

The most complicated issue of the SDR was to define the capability of the State to
support the fulfillment of tasks in the defence sphere with necessary resources, financial
support and so forth. The financial and economic crisis has considerably complicated
this process providing no indicators of future financial support to the Armed Forces and
other non-Armed Forces military formations. Under such circumstances the MOD has
requested to the Cabinet of Ministers and the Secretary of the National Security and
Defence Council to extend the time to complete the tasks stipulated in the SDR.
**The work on developing rational ways to transition to the prospective structures**

**Strategic Defence Review continues. The results will be provided in the Strategic**
**Defence Bulletin to 2025, serving as a long-term development strategy of the**
**Armed Forces.**

FUNDING The main problems of financial support to the Armed Forces in 2009 were
THE ARMED FORCES connected with the availability of discrepancies in the allocated amounts and
current requirements in the support and development of the Armed Forces, irregular
funding, and the drastic increase of the Special Fund in total amount of MOD

Forces in 2006-2009, billion UAH The amount of financial support of the Armed Forces in 2009, as well as in previous

Considering the financial crisis and economic situation of the country, the MOD has
defined the minimum required level as 17.5 billion UAH that would enable support of
the vital functions and fulfillment of the combat training activities.

The 2009 State Budget stipulated an allocation to MOD of 12.806 million UAH
(1.2% of GDP) to include from the General Fund **7,428.5 million UAH (58%),**
Special Fund – **4,221.6 million** UAH (33%), and Stabilization Fund –

Plan Actual


Actual financial support was 8,340.9 million UAH (0.79 % of GDP) – from the
General Fund 7,338.5 million UAH (88%), Special Fund – 588.4 million UAH (7%),
and Stabilization Fund – 414.0 million UAH (5%) (Appendix 2).
The total shortfall in funding was nearly 4.46 billion UAH (34.9 %), thus in 2009
financial support decreased by 1.19 billion UAH compared with the previous year.
Allocating less than 1% of GDP to defence is dangerous to the defence system of
the State especially with regards to such technology-intensive armed services as Air
Force and Navy that require considerable periods of time for the renewal of fighting
capability, even under conditions of further appropriate financial support.
The practice of planning a considerable part of uncertain funding from the Special
Fund, which as a planned share has increased five times in comparison with 2008,
continued in 2009. At the same time the actual funding from the Special Fund remained
as it was in the previous year (Diagram 1.9).
The principal causes for the low income from the Special Fund were:

  - inconsistency of the sales procedure with the regulations of the Land Code of
Ukraine[10];

  - stagnation of the real estate market as a result of the world financial crisis.
Besides, the percentage of financial support spent on running costs of the Armed
Forces has increased from 77% to 84% (64 % – in 2007) compared to 2008. Thus,
financing of Ukrainian AF has the nature of transiting from a “development” budget to
a “running cost” budget.
The amount of financial support to the Armed Forces in 2009 did not allow:

  - reaching the planned level of training and modernization of equipment;

  - continuing the work to introduce gradually the single automated command and
control system of the Armed Forces on the basis of modern means of processing
and transmitting information;

  - providing favourable conditions of service for contract Service personnel;

  - training of a certain number of military-trained mobilization resources and
reservists;

  - transferring arsenals, bases, and units not planned for the Armed Forces’ future
structure and continuing to release the Armed Forces from non-core functions;

  - carrying out the planned activities on the disposal of surplus and unsuitable
materiel, rockets, and ammunition;

  - providing the appropriate level of social support defined by the current legislation
for Service personnel, reserve, and retired.
The general underfunding of the State Programme for the Development of Armed
Forces of Ukraine 2006 - 2011 is 11.5 billion UAH which is 15.6% of the 73.4 billion
UAH provided by the Programme.

**In 2009 implementing the State Programme for the Development of the Armed**
**Forces of Ukraine 2006 - 2011 was conducted under the influence of the financial**
**and economic crisis which did not enable certain objectives to be achieved,**
**especially taking into account the underfunding of previous years.**
**At the same time, the Armed Forces have continued the work directed on**
**improving all aspects of their activity. They are a combat-effective military formation**
**capable of providing adequate reaction to possible threats in the military sphere.**
**The purposeful work took place to estimate the state and readiness level of the**
**Armed Forces to fulfil tasks as intended within the framework of the Strategic**
**Defence Review serving as the basis for the definition of material, financial and**
**human resources required for the guaranteed support of the State’s defence**
**and specification of the long-term prospects for the development of the Armed**
**Forces.**

In 2009 the main attention was to establishing SACS for the Air and Naval Forces
Commands. Piloting and preparation for State testing of “Dnipro” Automated Command
and Control System of the Armed Forces that provides communications between Armed
Forces command echelons continued.
High priority measures for creating of a single combined arms transport
communication network include:

                - laying fibre lines to “Ukrtelecom” Open Joint Stock Company enterprise;

                - establishing of digital automatic communications for the Armed Forces;

                - creating of information security systems based on domestic technologies;

posts;

                - linking communication points of the Armed Forces command posts to the general
transport communication network.
In 2009 fibre optic communication lines were laid for the first time in units and
authorities of Odesa, Chernihiv and Donetsk regions.

Strategic Level of Command

Throughout the year the work continued to improve the MOD and GS echelons to
increase cohesiveness exclude overlapping functions and tasks, and determine the
efficient ratio of military to civilian personnel[11].
The tasks of MOD concerning implementing national policies in the Armed Forces,

COMMAND A N D C O N T R O L SY ST E M OF T H E A R M E D F OR C E S OF UKR A I N E

Throughout the year two Air Force command posts have been equipped with new
automation equipment.
The formation of the Command and Warning Centres continued on the basis of
Air Force command centre of the Air Operations Centre and command posts of Air
Commands.
The command and control system of the Air Force provided stable, permanent and
on-going control of Stand-by Duty Force and air defence means.
The main focus has been put by the Naval Force Command on improving military
command and control echelons, enhancing operational flexibility and effectiveness
of their functions, and restoring station-keeping and mobile control facilities combat
power.
Throughout the year the Joint Operational Command has assumed control and
planning functions from the combined arms formations:

              - establishing control procedure of the land, air and naval components is
defined;

              - mutual support of other military formations and law-enforcement agencies in
case of legal emergency and military posture and interdictory effort against
terrorist acts at State facilities is organized;

             - participation of troops in anti-terrorist operations, assistance to
government bodies and population in natural and man-made disaster recovery
are planned.


ORGANIZATION
OF THE ARMED
FORCES


In 2009 the organization of the Armed Forces was changed slightly (Appendix 3).
In 2009 the operational tasks and strength of the Armed Forces were specified
considering:

  - Scenarios of using the Armed Forces based on the detailed national security
threats’ register in the military sphere;

             - augmentation of Immediate Reaction, Rapid
Reaction Forces and Special Operations Force role
to fulfil Armed Forces tasks in peace and war-time;

                - necessity of providing stable protection of important
State facilities, formations of the Armed Forces, air
defence combat duty, participation in interdictory
effort against terrorist acts with protection of
important State installations.
The overall strength of the Armed Forces was 200,000
personnel, of which 150,000 were Service personnel at
the end of 2009 (Appendix 3).
The functions and tasks of the operational line
command echelons were defined more precisely in Land
_Force. The piloting of multi-functional mobile formations_
and units as part of the Joint Rapid Reaction Forces
continued.
Throughout the year the selection of rational
organization and establishment of Air Force’s aviation,
capable of enhancing aircrew skill, improving airfield
technical, radio-technical support of flights and achieving
assigned missions with maximum effectiveness continued.

The relevant pilot[13] of separating functions of combat use of aviation units’ (laid
on aviation brigade) and all-round support of aviation units’ employment and combat
training (laid on aviation base) has been implemented.
The measures were put into effect in Naval Force, directed to improve the command
facilities organizational structures and augmentation of coast guard troops strength and
organization.
The Armed Services’ Structure, Combat Strength and Manpower of the Armed
Forces at the end of 2009 are shown at Appendix 3.

All priority directions of weapon and equipment renewal by the State Programme of
Development of Weapons and Equipment to 2015 were continued within the State
financial allocation for Defence Request 2009. The Armed Forces were equipped
with up-to-date and future-focused weapons and equipment developed on the basis
of advanced technologies. Though this renewal is behind the world standards [14]
(Appendix 3). In 2009 the actual funding of development, procurement and modernization of weapons and equipment according to Budget programmes was 483.3 million UAH, (21% of the budget). In total, throughout the year 19 weapons and equipment items were adopted for service by the Armed Forces – almost one-third fewer
than in the previous year. In the circumstances the MOD and GS have taken the initiatives supported at State level, among them:

      - improvements of conceptual foundations of national system of weapons, military
and special materiel[15] development and production that enhance the control of
such activity, achievement of coherence of all participants’ actions, adoption
of optimum technical decisions, minimization of state budget expenses and
reduction of weapons and equipment development terms and introduction;

                     - provision of settlements with repair bases for executed
works, the excess aviation material, assemblies and
aircraft that are unnecessary and preserved by the
Armed Forces[16]. In the limit of finance the MOD has
found additional opportunities to modernize, repair
and maintain aviation materiel;

                - procurement and modernization of weapons
and equipment according to the State Defence
Request from the Stabilized Fund from national
manufacturers[17].
Throughout the year we have managed to complete
State testing, adopt in service the “Oplot” battle tank,
information analytical planning system of the Armed
Forces mobilization deployment, manufacture the pilot
item of automated mobile command post of radio-technical troops.

The scientific and research on radars, anti-aircraft missiles systems modernization
including mobile ones and other weapons and equipment of the Air Force continued,
inter alia the AN-70 military transport aircraft and MIG-29, SU-25, L-39 aircraft. In
2009 the first items of modernized aircraft were produced. The modernized aircraft
enable the fulfilment of combat tasks more effectively due to improvements in engine
characteristics, new navigation, sighting systems and flight information recording
equipment.
Restoring the technical state of Land Force’s air defence troops materiel, works
to extend the anti-aircraft guided missiles technical availability, and modernizing
helicopter engines have been launched. The operational-technical requirements of

###### CHAPTER 3

 FORCE’S TRAINING

raining of the Armed Forces of Ukraine is the basis of their combat effectiveness (operational
##### Tcapability) and implemented by the range of activities, planned in advanced in the common and
continuous process of professional skills acquisition. The peculiarity of 2009 training year was the fact
that successive theoretical education of the servicemen and reinforcement of knowledge and skills during
the practical training with practicing qualification on the materiel were accepted as a basis for the force
(troops) training.


FORCES’ TRAINING
SUPPORT


The content and performance of Forces’ training in 2009 were mainly defined by
resources provided. Thus, 312.8 Million UAH were apprehended to allocate to
Forces’ training (20.6% of the baseline requirement). In fact, the funding allocated
was 6 times less than the previous year.
MOD expectations from the Special Fund was not met: about 0.1 % was received
of the planned amount (267.9 Million UAH).

That is why the main efforts in Forces’ training in 2009 were focused on aviation
units’ training, that are doing combat duty for air defence of State vital installions,
support of instructor pilot baseline flying time of aviation units, and high-level training
of a limited number of specialists in training centres.
Under such conditions, there were implemented:

  - a limited number of high-cost tactical and Command-Post Exercises, scales and
format of combat training practical activities in military units and formations;

  - high priority financing of Service personnel training in the training centres and
air personnel involved in combat duty in the State air defence system;
Staff training was implemented in the bases with the conduct of command-post and
map exercises. The most effective ways of staff training became joint Command-Post
Exercises with command and control of airmobile (mechanized) brigades and army
aviation regiments, and computer-assisted exercises.
Training facility, available simulators and modulation systems were used more
actively.
Improvement and implementation in new forms and methods of military training
were introduced during the year. The Land Force’s section for combat simulation
modeling was established and started functioning.
The Command-Post Exercises of the 8[th] Army Corps using combat simulation and
modeling systems proved the importance of these activities.

RESULTS OF FORCES’
TRAINING PLANS


The theoretical component of Forces’ training was
increased by 30% to prevent the decrease of the training
level attained in 2008. Additional training was offer in
NATO standard operating procedures during the year.
Personnel language training was also improved.
In particular, the high-level training of Service
personnel was directed to:

               - provide maintenance of the necessary training level
of General and Officers;

                - prevent the decrease in the level of contract Personnel
training;

               - provide formation and development of the necessary
level of training for conscripted personnel.
The principles of relations between society and the Armed Forces that had been
formed in previous years facilitated the extension of their activities and impacted on the
Forces’ combat practical training in 2009. In consequence of patronage and charitable
sponsorship from certain citizens, organizations and societies, a series of high-cost
units’ training activities were held.[18]

During 2009, the JRRF training level attained in previous years was sustained, however, the planned indexes of Land, Air and Maritime high-level training of personnel
were not achieved as a result of objective reasons.
In comparison to previous year, the number of Command-Post Exercises decreased
by 1.5 times. At the same time, the number of brigades’ staff training increased almost
two-fold. It provided sustainability of the proper level of cohesiveness and command
and control agencies’ general training.
At the end of the year comprehensive operational readiness inspection was
conducted in military units of all Services. Having been alerted, they conducted longrange marches and successfully executed combat training missions at training ranges.
_In the Armed Forces, the amount of armoured vehicle armament live-firing and_
driving training time reduced almost by 3 to 4 times in comparison to the previous year
(Appendix 4).
The average Forces’ combat training indicators decreased almost 3 times compared
to previous years and under 10-15 % of those stated in the Armed Forces’ State
Development Programme 2006-2011. At the same time, taking into consideration the
changed format of Forces’ training, its effectiveness reduced by 25% to 30 % only, and
the share of high-quality and high-cost training was one-half compared to 2008.
Aviation crews’ average flying time decreased by 55% to 60 % compared to the
previous year.
In the Land Force, training plans and curricula on key subjects were fulfilled: in JRRF
military units and detachments by 72%, in MDF military units and formations by 61%.


18 In consequence of public organizations assistance there were implemented in the Armed Forces of Ukraine:

   - parachuting by air-assault training program (separate airmobile brigade of the 8[th] Army Corps of the Land Forces, deployed in Zhytomyr
Region – supported by public organization “Nobody, except us”; separate special operations regiment of the Land Forces, deployed in Khmel’nytskiy
Region, – supported by LTD Western aviation partnership association “Sky Group”; separate airborne brigade of the 6[th] Army Corps of the Land Forces,
deployed in Dnipropetrovsk Region, – supported by Partnership association of assistance to Ukraine defence);

   - encampment and tactical testing exercise in fire control and coordination of separate artillery brigade howitzer battalion of the 6[th] Army Corps of the Land
Forces, deployed in Zaporizhia Region, under the auspices of charity fund “Patriot of Zaporizhia” and under the aegis of Head of Zaporozhia regional
state administration.

In comparison to 2008, the part of high-cost and high-quality forms of combat training
decreased by 65 %. Generally, Service personnel individual training was improved by
means of increasing the amount of theoretical training, but units’ cohesiveness training
was to the extent of about 15% to 20% only.
Implementation of Command-Post Exercises was continued at brigade-level.
Exercises of this kind were conducted with 2 detached mechanized brigades
(Diagram 3.1) and a detached airborne brigade.
Individual pilot training programme of certain crews, involved in airborne alert
in the air defence system, was carried out in the Air Force. The amount of practical
training: namely tactical bombing by 6 times, airborne drops by 2 times, significantly
decreased compared to 2008.

INTERNATIONAL
EXERCISES IN THE
GENERAL FORCE
TRAINING SYSTEM


Research training of tactical aviation brigades’ units took place as part of the pilot.
The practicability of tactical aviation brigade reforming into an air base was proved
and military unit optimum organization and establishment was defined by its results.
Proposed air base organization and establishment provides for possibility of stationing
any type of aviation materiel in the airfield.
_In the Naval Force the percentage of sea component in the combat training of ship-_
board personnel decreased by 10% - 15% compared to the previous year. The average
time at sea of ships and boats decreased almost 3 times.
The significant contribution to increasing land and sea component training level was
the Command-Post Exercise of all-Arms Forces Grouping in Lake Donuzlav region. The
units’ practical activities, implemented during this Exercise, provided the possibility
to train their cohesiveness, and in fact, substituted the range of unplanned high-cost
combat training activities.

Multi-national military exercises remain one of the most effective forms of Forces’
training. Its importance for the Armed Forces increases annually. From 2008 units
scheduled for national peace-keeping rotation are involved in multi-national military exercises.

There were intended to be 23 multi-national exercises (11 in Ukraine and 12 abroad)
conducted as required by defence capabilities in 2009. During the year, Ukrainian units
participated in 15 large-scale international military exercises[19]: 5 of which were in
Ukraine and 10 were abroad. (Diagram 3.2.)
Ukrainian Service personnel were not able to participate in several international
exercises due to the absence of legal reasons.[20] This negatively affected Ukrainian
prestige in the international arena, poorly reflected on Forces’ training results due to
the inability to additional resources and capabilities.
Moreover, despite the actual decrease in the number of multi-national military
exercises, their share in the combat training system of the Armed Forces increased
almost 2.5 times in 2009. (Diagram 3.3.).

A broad range of tasks was practised during international military exercises
(Appendix 5). This enabled improving interoperability of national and foreign military
units.
Ukraine’s participation in the PfP Programme in the framework of which units of the
Armed Forces are actively involved in PARP was continued. The JRRF interoperability
process with NATO nations’ armed forces is continuing. In particular, the cycle of
NATO 1[st] Level Evaluation of the main units offered to the Joint Pool of Forces of the
Operational Capabilities Concept was completed.
During the year in the framework of the Evaluation and Feedback Programme of the
Operational Capabilities Concept 3 Self-Evaluations and 6 NATO 1[st] Level Evaluations
were conducted (Table 3.2.). All Ukrainian units successfully implemented the activities
planned and were evaluated as either “interoperable” or “partially interoperable”.

 PROFESSIONALIZATION OF THE ARMED FORCES

he modern stage of the Armed Forces’ development requires an integrated solution to the process of
##### Ttransition to professional Armed Forces, providing manned units that are capable of effective execution
of tasks and maintaining the appropriate level of combat readiness.
The implementation of a new Centralized Personnel Management System along with the improvement
of the system of military education and science according to the Service principle, and search for new
forms and ways of rational distribution and effective usage of the personnel continued.


RESULTS OF
IMPLEMENTATION
OF THE MAIN
PRINCIPLES
OF PERSONNEL
POLICY


During the year the activity of the MOD was directed towards the practical implementation of the principles of the Armed Forces’ Personnel Policy Concept. The main
focus was implementing the following priorities[21]:

  - transiting to the Centralized Personnel Management System;

  - improving the system of military education, introducing of multi-level training
system for the NCOs;

  - improving the Military-Patriotic education system, moral and psychological
support of the Armed Forces’ personnel;

  - improving the professional adaptation system of the Service personnel;

  - improving the system of citizens acceptance to military service.

Improvement of the Personnel Management System


The normative rearrangement of activity of personnel agencies of the Armed Forces
continued in 2009. In particular the mechanism for implementation of the Regulation
“On Procedures of Ukrainian Citizens Serving in the Armed Forces”[22] was established and the corresponding instruction was developed[23].

**Table 4.1. The main activities of the personnel bodies of the Armed** The main activities, objectives, functions, authorities

Career management of Service personnel

According to the results of the pilot Centralized Personnel Management System during the year:

               - typical Service personnel’s career management algorithm and its application
procedure have been developed and approved[25]. A typical algorithm comprises
the position records depending on the position categories, stages of Service
personnel’s career development and level of his/her education and professional
training;

                - Officers’ Position Profile have been proposed[26]. Position Profile includes: the
basic requirements that define the criteria for the appropriate performance of
duties, and additional requirements which determine
desirable experience from previous service.

                           - advisory boards were established and launched.
These are Personnel Centres’ Boards designed

In order to achieve interoperability between Ukrainian Armed Forces and NATO
countries’ Armed Forces a new Concept of personnel language training was developed[36].
The time for learning foreign language by students in higher military education
establishments and military training units of higher education establishments has been
increased from 504 to 648 hours, requirements for standard language levels (from Level
1 to Level 5) according to NATO “STANAG-6001” were determined.
In 2009 training was conducted in 25 classes including 2 classes for Contract
personnel for intensive learning of English language for 4 months’ training and 5
classes for higher level of English language for 3 months’ training and classes for
German, French and Turkish. During the year 590 Service personnel and 64 civilians
received language training courses.

The main focus of the MOD in 2009 was aimed at the practical implementation of
the manning system in the daily routine of the Armed Forces, based on the Territorial
Centres’ network, exclusion of the reduction of Service personnel manning on contract-basis and activization of the enlistment system.


35 Common Order of the Ministry of Defence and the Ministry of Education and Science “On the Approval of the amendments to the List of directions, specialties
and specialization of training of military experts in higher military educational establishments and military training units of higher educational establishments
at respective qualification and education levels” #185/348 as of April, 17, 2009
36 Concept has been approved by the Order of the Minister of Defence #267 as of June, 1, 2009

Development of Non-Commissioned Officers’ Corps

Non-Commissioned Officers play a leading role in the professional Armed Forces
that foresees a continuous acquisition of theoretical and practical skills necessary for
military service in a command positions.
During the year the system of professional NCO’s preparation was improved, in
particular:

                - the state licensing of Armed Forces’ training military centres where Contract
Service personnel will receive an education-qualification “qualified worker” has
been conducted;

               - the Sergeant Training Centre was reformed into the Military NCOs College of
National Technical University “Kharkiv Polytechnical Institute”[37] that started
NCOs’ training from 1 September 2009;

                           - The Army NCOs College named after Hetman Petro
Sahaydachnyi (Lviv) and the Navy NCOs college
of the Nakhimov Navy Academy (Sevastopol) was
established.

                           - This enabled the introduction of a multi-level
training system[38] in 2009 that foresees successive
preparation of NCOs before assignment to higher
positions:

                            - Basic level – in 14 training centers of the Armed
Forces Services and Branches on the basis of
the previously received education-qualification
“qualified worker” according to the defined
specialisms;

                         - Medium level – in the Military NCOs College
of the National Technical University “Kharkiv
Polytechnical Institute”, military colleges of the
Armed Forces’ Services, Branches, special forces for

Remuneration

The existing level of allowance (it was last increased
in early 2008) makes it difficult for military service to
compete in the labour market and does not motivate
citizens to join the Armed Forces.
As a rule, the allowance of the head of family that
comprises 70% – 100% of total income predominates in
the family budget of Service personnel.
The minimum allowance for Service personnel in the
first year of Contract service is 821 UAH, that is twice
less than the average wage in Ukraine (1,955 UAH
in November 2009) and considerably lower than the
average wage in other areas (the lowest average wage in
the “agricultural sector” was 1,240 UAH in November
2009) (Diagram 4.8).

The improvement of the medical support system continued. Thus, in order to
implement common approaches of medical support in the Armed Forces the management
agency, Military-Medical Department, was created. On the basis of military-medical
clinical centres, clinics were created, in particular:

               - in the Main military-medical clinical centre (Kyiv) – centres of cardiac and
vessels’ surgery, endoscopic diagnostics and surgery and detoxication centre;

Specialized medical units according to the defined
clinical profiles and climate and nature medical factors
were established in the Centres of Medical Rehabilitation
and Sanatorium Therapy.

The work completed provided the opportunity even
under conditions of limited resources not to reduce last
year’s indexes and to give highly-qualified medical
treatment to more than 155,000 people.

Social State of Patients is given in Diagram 4.9.

However, Service personnel, war and veterans,
and their families and Armed Forces’ employees have
received treatment in the Armed Forces’ Sanatoriums
1.6 times less than in 2008 (that is 16,400 - 2% fewer
than the general number of people provided with the
Armed Forces medical support) (Diagram 4.10.).

Indexes of Housing of Service personnel and persons subject to retirement and
discharged are not implemented from year to year and that is the most problematic
question for the MOD.

The situation concerning Service housing became catastrophic for the Armed Forces
in 2009. Thus the State Budget has allocated 755.7 million UAH from the Special Fund,
but only 98.6 million UAH (11 %) was received (Diagram 4.11.).

During the year on the initiative of the MOD actions to improve the situation
concerning Service housing have been conducted, in particular:

  - the development of mechanism to build (procure) affordable housing for Service
personnel, their family and personnel subject to retirement and discharged
persons at the expense of the State Budget[46] begun;

  - Service personnel with more than 20 years’ service were given the right to receive
compensation housing allowance[47];

  - the acquisition of part-build housing constructions[48] by the State mortgage
institution was adjusted.

However, the work done does not improve Service
personnel housing. Only 85 apartments were built
(acquired) from the State Budget. This is the lowest
number of houses constructed in the past decade. Thereby
the number of Service personnel without housing has
**increased by 2,800 at the end of 2009 (Diagram 4.12.).**
In general, 45,100 Service personnel are on the
Housing Waiting List at the end of 2009, including 30,400
for permanent housing and 14,700 for Service housing, of
which 11,100 Service personnel subject to retirement and

 INTERNATIONAL COOPERATION, PEACE-KEEPING ACTIVITY, ARMS CONTROL

n 2009 international cooperation aimed at ensuring the Armed Forces development and creating
##### Ifavourable conditions to support Ukraine’s course towards acquiring membership in NATO and the
European Union. In addition, considerable attention was paid to ensuring Ukraine’s participation in
regional cooperation, promoting peace and stability in Eastern Europe and in the world.
The effective employment of the whole range of international cooperation activities in the defence
sphere is a key instrument to increase the Armed Forces’ capabilities, enhance their interoperability with
NATO nations’ Armed Forces, and strengthen Ukraine’s international reputation.
The participation of Ukrainian Armed Forces personnel in multi-national exercises and peace-keeping
activities enables experience to be acquired that is necessary to fulfil the tasks in the State Programme of
the Armed Forces’ Development 2006-2011.


INTERNATIONAL
COOPERATION


In 2009 the main tasks of international cooperation were as follows:

  - Sustaining effective political-military, military-military and military and
technical dialogue with strategic partners of Ukraine, neighbouring countries
and other leading nations in order to ensure the further promotion of Ukraine’s
European and Euro-Atlantic ambitions and to promote its national interests in
the region and in the world,

  - Sustaining appropriate level of mutual trust, as well as acquiring international
advisory and materiel support for further development and comprehensive
modernization of the Armed Forces.
Out of 1,041 international events 603 events were conducted during 2009.
Due to objective reasons 438 events were cancelled or postponed (Diagram 5.1). To
improve the regulatory legislation for international cooperation, 11 international treaties
(3 inter-governmental treaties and 8 inter-departmental treaties) were signed during

DEVELOPMENT OF
RELATIONS WITH
NATO


Ukraine considers development of cooperation with the Alliance to be one of the key
mechanisms of Armed Forces reform and the wider defence sector to comply with the
Alliance’s membership requirements, which means:

  - ensuring the capability of the Armed Forces to fulfil its tasks to defend the
country;

  - ensuring the appropriate interoperability between Armed Force’s units and NATO
nations’ military structures;

  - ensuring national contribution to Alliance activities, including NATO-led
operations.
These activities are of a systemic nature. In 2009, for the first time, they were
performed within the 1[st] Annual National Programme aimed at preparing Ukraine to
join NATO[1], implementation of which is aimed at the promotion of internal reforms
concerning the whole range of State activities. The ANP structure and content closely
correspond to the Membership Action Plan. According to the 2009 ANP, the MOD was
assigned as executor of 234 events and co-executor of a further 22 events. During the
year the following aims were achieved:

  - sustaining political and military dialogue between leaders of the Armed Forces
and the Alliance;

  - sustaining Armed Forces’ participation in international peace-keeping, in
particular concerning NATO-led operations;

  - fulfilling further transition to professional Armed Forces, namely creating a
professional Sergeant Corps;

  - providing training for civilian personnel in the defence and security sector[2].
The ANP execution was assessed positively at the meeting Ukraine-NATO Political
Steering Committee.
Other formats of NATO-Ukraine cooperation are the NATO-Ukraine Military
Committee Work Plan, the NATO-Ukraine Individual Partnership Programme, NATOUkraine High-Level Joint Working Group on Defence Reform Work Plan and the
Planning and Review Process (PARP), as well as other
common projects both with NATO and on a bilateral
basis with NATO countries.
Within the PARP framework Ukraine improved the
national defence planning system, achieved transparency
in defence budget planning, improved capabilities of
Ukraine’s Armed Forces and other structures in terms
of participation in international counter-terrorism
measures, and support of civilian authorities concerning
natural and man-made disaster management.[3]

At the same time the main focus of the MOD and
GS were aimed at developing compatibility of the above
mentioned forces and the means engage in the whole
range of peace-keeping activities and providing training
for military authorities, military units and sub-units
assigned to participate in PARP and in common actions with NATO nations’ armed
forces.[4]


1 ANP2009 approved by the Decree of the President of Ukraine #600/2009 issued on the 7th of August 2009
2 During the year 275 representatives of the Ministry of Defence and the Armed Forces were trained at language courses and professional courses.
3 At present the Ministry of Defence and the Armed Forces have implemented 70 Partnership Goals according to PARP (36 general goals, 19 – for the Army,
8 – for the Navy, 7 – for the Air Force).
4 During 2009 three units conducted self- evaluation of the 1st level and six more units passed the NATO evaluation of the 1st level.

As a result of the Operational Capabilities Concept Evaluation and Feedback
Programme implementing operational capabilities and combat readiness of assigned
military units were reinforced according to NATO standards, by achieving the
interoperability level necessary to fulfil a wide range of tasks in cooperation with NATO
nations’ units, including a contribution to NATO’s Response Forces.[5]
For effective implementation of the NATO Air Situation Data Exchange (ASDE)
programme a NATO-certified data exchange centre was created in the Air Force,
operational procedures were adopted, and constant communication and data exchange
with the NATO Command and Warning Centre were enabled.
In 2009 the NAC approved the decision to open the second line of data exchange
between Ukraine and NATO within the ASDE programme.
Ukraine is the only Partner nation participating in four out of five NATO-led
operations. Taking into account limited resources sustaining the format of the Armed
Forces participation in NATO operations is an important achievement in 2009.
Ukraine’s National Security and Defence Council approved the decision to increase
the Ukrainian peace-keeping contingent in the International Security Assistance Force
(ISAF).
Ukraine continues to provide a peace-keeping contingent and personnel for Kosovo
Force (KFOR) and the NATO Training Mission in Iraq (NTM-I).
During October and November 2009 the corvette
“Ternopil” successfully completed tasks in the NATO
anti-terrorist Operation “Active Endeavour” in the
Mediterranean.
**In 2009 Ukraine continued to pursue the course**
**aimed at meeting the defence criteria of Alliance**
**membership. The events in the Annual National**
**Programme aimed at preparing the country to join**
**NATO were conducted, the format of Ukraine’s**
**Armed Forces participation in NATO-led operations**
**was sustained, the level of interoperability between**
**Armed Forces’ units and corresponding units of**
**NATO-countries was enhanced. The preparation**
**of assigned forces and means to participation in**
**NATO’s Response Forces was performed which will**
**enable further development of Ukraine’s Armed**
**Forces’ capabilities.**


COOPERATION WITH
THE EUROPEAN
UNION


In order to fulfil the strategic statements of national legislative acts concerning European integration practical measures of defence cooperation between the
European Union and the Ukrainian Armed Forces were conducted according to the
EU – Ukraine Action Plan and the new document “EU-Ukraine Association Agenda”
concerning MOD, as well as the 2009 Cooperation Work Plan for the Armed Forces
and the European Union Council Secretariat (in the sphere of European Security and
Defence Policy).


5 During 2009, in terms of providing Armed Forces resources for NATO’s Response Forces, propositions of the Federal Republic of Germany were considered
concerning possible participation of NCB-platoon with dosimetric and chemical control section of the Armed Forces of Ukraine in the 15[th] rotation of NATO’s
Response Forces led by Germany. In addition to it, in order to ensure systemacy of means and forces participation in NATO’s Response Forces one aircraft
IL-76 MD of the Air Force is supposed to participate in the 16[th] rotation of NATO’s Response Forces.

In the military sphere the main directions of cooperation between the EU and
Ukraine were as follows:

                            - enforcing strategic dialogue between the leaders of
the MOD, GS and political leaders of EU countries;

                         - participating in EU-led operations as well as
providing Armed Forces resources for EU Battle
Groups;

                            - training Ukraine’s representatives in courses in EU
education institutions;

                              - deploying Ukraine military transport aviation for airlift tasks for EU-countries.
Within the political and military dialogue between
Ukraine and the EU, issues of cooperation between
the Ukrainian Armed Forces and EU-countries’ armed
forces, the creation of EU Battle Groups as well as
Ukraine’s possible participation in the European Security
and Defence Policy were discussed.[6]

In 2009 Ukraine was officially invited to participate in the EU military operation
EUFOR ALTHEA in Bosnia and Herzegovina that created the formal basis to develop
this issue.
The Armed Forces contribution to EU Battle Groups was one of the prospective
and essential tasks to be considered. The following was done within this framework in
2009:

              - engagement of the aero-medical aircraft AN-26 “Vita” into the Baltic Battle
Group (Poland, Germany, Latvia, Lithuania, Slovakia);

             - the mechanism of engagement in the EU Battle Group HELBROC (Greece,
Bulgaria, Romania and Cyprus), and the Italian-Hungarian-Slovakian Battle
Group due to start active duty in the first and second half of 2012 respectively,
and in the prospective group to be formed by the Vyshegrad Group (Poland,
Slovakia, Hungary, Czech Republic).
The agreement between the Ukrainian MOD and the Czech Republic MOD
concerning strategic airlift came into force.[7] During the year bilateral consultations with
Italy, Latvia, Lithuania, Slovakia, Romania and Hungary were conducted concerning
further involvement of Ukraine’s aviation transport capabilities.
**During 2009 cooperation between EU military structures and Ukraine to**
**support Ukrainian Armed Forces’ capabilities development, especially concerning**
**EU-led operations, defining and preparing to participate in EU Battle Groups, as**
**well as involving Ukraine’s aviation transport capabilities.**
**Another important evidence of EU and Ukraine cooperation effectiveness in**
**2009 was the orientation of bilateral cooperation events to acquire EU-membership**
**by Ukraine.**


6 In April 2009 the Chief of General Staff – Commander-in-Chief of the Armed Forces of Ukraine participated in the meeting of chiefs of general staffs of armed
forces of Vyshegrad group countries, Ukraine and Baltic countries. The Head of EU Military Committee and the Chief of General Staff – Commander-in-Chief
of the Armed Forces of Ukraine meet as scheduled.

BILATERAL
COOPERATION


In 2009 the Armed Forces cooperated with defence agencies of 48 countries. Of the
total planned bilateral events 58% are with NATO- and EU-countries.
Most bilateral events were conducted with the US, Germany, Turkey, Poland, the
Russian Federation, France, and Belarus (Diagram 5.2).
A considerable part of bilateral events was cooperation with strategic partners - US,
Poland and the Russian Federation.
In the defence sphere cooperation between Ukraine and the US is the most, intense,
active and large-scale. Its legal basis includes 20 inter-government and inter-department
treaties and legal acts. During the year, 98 events were conducted which is the highest
number and continues the practice of previous years.
The U.S.-Ukraine Strategic Partnership Commission meeting took place and issues

To develop the legal basis, the President approved Ukraine’s Strategy for international
peace-keeping[15] which sets the main tasks, mechanisms to pursue national interests and
priority aims of our country’s participation in peacekeeping. (Appendix 5.2)

**Appendix 5.2. Ukraine’s priority aims of participation in international** As a part of the multinational forces in Kosovo

Polish Battalion of the multinational Battle Group

  - maintaining Ukraine’s active participation in international “East” completed such tasks as support of the rule of
military formations and expansion format of actions aimed at

peace and security maintenance;

rights.

  - strengthening of Ukraine’s international authority and

detachment in Liberia was highly appraised by the

European and Euro-Atlantic security space;

UN Mission and local population after completing air

  - realization of national interests

medical transport tasks.
At the end of the year approximately 530 Armed
Forces’ personnel were participating in 8 missions in 7 countries.
**During 2009 the priority direction of the activities of the MOD was to sustain**
**the format of the Armed Forces participation in international peacekeeping and**
**to implement practical aspects to increase Ukraine’s participation in safeguarding**
**security in critical areas.**
**Experience gained in international peacekeeping by the Armed Forces is used**
**for training peace-keeping personnel and contingents to further contribute to**
**safeguarding peace, security and stability in the world.**

ARMS CONTROL Implementing the whole range of arms control measures fosters mutual trust between
participating countries and enables effective monitoring of international commitments in this sphere.
Such events in Ukraine were characterized by active involvement of participating
nations, by full use of allocations (passive quota) to conduct inspections, by the most
challenging financial situation, to conduct events in Ukraine without the right to
refuse.
According to the 1999 Vienna document which
regulates international cooperation in the sphere of
building confidence and security 7 events were held
in Ukraine. Ukraine conducted 1 event abroad. In
addition, Armed Forces’ personnel participated in the
demonstration of aviation bases, new armament systems
and military equipment in Turkey and Hungary.
According to the Treaty on Conventional Armed
Forces in Europe 30 control events were held in Ukraine
whereas Ukraine conducted only 18 inspections due to
the lack of funding.
At present the future of the Treaty is connected
with US- Russia negotiations and Joint Consultative
Group meetings according to the Treaty on
Conventional Forces in Europe (CFE). In addition to

the analysis of the new situation is actively conducted during Berlin seminars initiated
by Germany.
To fulfill bilateral inter-state agreements to build confidence and security
supplementary trust and security events an additional 6 control events were held in
Ukraine. Ukraine conducted 3 inspections abroad in 2009.
According to the Open Skies Agreement Ukraine hosted 12 observation flights. Due
to the lack of funding Ukraine conducted only 4 observation missions abroad.
In addition, Ukraine actively collaborated with participating countries in terms of
contracting out a Ukrainian survey aircraft, AN-30B, for observation missions. During
2009 our aircraft was used for inspectors’ control events by Poland (twice), Slovakia
and the UK.
**Ukraine’s active participation in arms control and non-proliferation measures**
**strengthens its image of a reliable and open country.**


**Ukraine’s participation in international military cooperation is an effective tool**
**of foreign policy aimed at European and Euro-Atlantic integration, development**
**of the Armed Forces’ capabilities and improvement of Ukraine’s and the Armed**
**Forces’ international reputation.**
**Through fulfillment of international military commitments Ukraine reasserts**
**its role as a substantial and reliable contributor to international and regional**
**security, peace and stability.**


-----

###### CONCLUSION

According to this year’s results the Ukrainian Armed Forces, in general, are ready
to fulfill their appropriate tasks. Although 2009 was proclaimed the “Year of Land
Force”, due to the permanent lack of funding considerable increase of combat and
mobilization readiness of Land Force’s and other Armed Force’s unit was not achieved.
At the same time, Force’s operational capabilities and integrity of the State Air
Defence System were retained.
**2010 is declared the “Year of management system development and resumption**
**of combat readiness enhancement of the Armed Forces”.**
The main priorities of Armed Force’s development are defined as follows:

  - improve Armed Force’s management system and logistic support, transit to
digital communication system, develop unified automated command and control
system;

  - maintain readiness of selected Joint Rapid Reaction Forces (JRRF) military units
to accomplish appropriate tasks, ensure readiness of Air Defence Duty units to
cover key installations, enhance combat readiness of Special Operations Forces
and restore battle capabilities of advance technology branches of the Armed
Forces – Air Force and Naval Force;

  - complete the Strategic Defence Review and improve strategic planning of use of
Armed Force;

  - improve further the manning system, create appropriate conditions for transition
to professional Armed Force, and introduce Reserve Service;

  - dispose of excess armament and equipment, ammunition and propellant
components from arsenals, bases and warehouses due to be closed in 20102011;

  - fulfil unconditionally Ukraine’s international military commitments, and
strengthen cooperation with all partners and neighbours.

#### 50 YEARS ON RADAR ENGENEERING MARKET

###### Zaporozhian state enterprise the «Scientific-Production Complex «Iskra» begins its history in August 1959, when Zaporozhian factory of movable power- stations was founded. Nowadays SE «SPC «Iskra», headed by director Igor Presnyak, is the unique enterprise of Ukraine which has a complete cycle of  modern RS designing – from developing, manufacturing, testing and delivering to their firm accompaniment, which includes services, maintaince, modernization and personnel training.

 Success of enterprise is defined by high scientific potential of developers and great 50-year experience in production, application of high technologies together with the worked out system of quality and reliability of products, complete complex of guarantees and services of products made.

 With a brand «Iskra» almost seven thousand highly effective, reliable and simple in exploitation of the radar stations have been produced and which are exploited more than in 50 countries of the world and got the deserved confession of specialists in CIS. So on the armament of Ukraine and Russian Federation 30% RLS, all those produced on SE «SPC «Iskra».


###### In 2007 new development RLS 79K6 – a three coordinate station is accepted on arming by Ministry of Defence of Ukraine.

### «Kharkiv Mechanical Maintaince Plant»

###### ARMOR INNOVATIONS OF KHARKIV MECHANICAL MAINTAINCE PLANT

Kharkiv mechanical maintaince plant apart from actually tanks developed considerable amount of innovative
projects which allow to offer the customer ‘weapon of the XXI century’. The developed models of vehicles and
armament meet the latest requirements both on the level of protectability and fire power. Taking into account
experience of the use of aromor vehicles in the modern armed conflicts, KhMMP specialists on the systems and
assemblies tank T-64 basis created a wheeled and tracked IFV with the «tank» protection level. On tank T-80 basis
APC is being designed with the protection level which considerably exceeds the protection level of a modern
tank.

The program of T-72 tank modernization as for replacing its engine by more powerful engine of the Ukrainian
production to get a strap-on thruster engine and a conditioner has been worked out. Moreover, KhMMP specialists
developed the program of Armed Forces tank park complex modernization where T-55 tanks are in use. Unlike
projects of considerable cost which need engine replacement, transmission and tank running gear strengthening,
an offered project, where tank T-55 chassis is completely replaced by tank T-64 chassis. Thus the created fighting
machine has a tank T-55 turret with a 100-mm tank gun for which the considerable arsenals of sabot armory
are created, and it does not need crew’s retraining. The use of tank T-64 chassis allows reducing a project cost
considerably to improve mobility, armour protection and ammunition. Tank T-55 body that freed after a «exchange»
due to the worked out technology, reconfigured into IFV with the protection level that does not yield to tank
protection. In its turn a 125 mm tank gun and a mechanism of loading gear remained from T-64 can be transformed
into the fortificated remote controlled combat module which is lead by an operator from safe distance.

One of the latest tendencies in development of modern aarmoured vehicles is the use of remote controlled
combat modules that allow promoting to increase the fire power of machine with max strength protection level
for an operator. KhMMP specialists do not lack behind – in the last few years they have designed a family of
bullet-pump and main-gun and grenade launcher remote controlled combat modules which do not yield to the
latest western samples. A number of samples of special vehicles has been designed: a tacked fire machine, family
of industrial tractors, a bridge tank. All the mentioned above samples of vehicles already exist in «metal». It worth
mentioning, that due to the use of the tested tank assemblies, developments of KhMMP are characterized by high
operational reliability, and hereby, cost of these samples of armament and vehicles one step lower than the western
analogues.
