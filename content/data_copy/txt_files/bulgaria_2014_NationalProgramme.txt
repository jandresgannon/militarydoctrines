**_Vision: Bulgaria in NATO and in European Defence 2020_**

І. INTRODUCTION

The present **"Vision: Bulgaria in NATO and in European Defence 2020"** is
approved by the Security Council of the Council of Ministers in relation to the
upcoming NATO Summit in Wales (4-5 September 2014). This document is
developed on the basis of the **White Paper on Defence and the Armed Forces**
adopted by the Parliament of the Republic of Bulgaria on 28 October, 2010, taking
into account changes in the security environment, implementation of the Plan for
the Development of the Armed Forces, and its expiration at the end of 2014.

Notwithstanding the short time until the Summit, the development of this Vision
began within the framework of the interagency working group under the
leadership of the Minister of Foreign Affairs and the Minister of Defence, chaired by
the Deputy Minister of Defence for defence policy as organisational secretary,
passed through the Defence Council of the Ministry of Defence, an expert public
discussion and was finalised following a discussion within the Security Council of
the Council of Ministers, which approved it on 1 September, 2014.

The Vision updates the assessment of the external security environment,
substantiates the benefits from defence investments, defines the way of reaching
higher defence expenditures in accordance with the discussion within NATO, and
defines the key capabilities necessary for a contemporary national defence within
the framework of the allocated resources.

On the basis of this Vision and the decisions made at the NATO Summit in
September 2014, the Council of Ministers will adopt a National Program: Bulgaria
**in NATO and in European Defence 2020, in accordance with the priorities and**
tasks of the caretaker government.

All state structures with competences within the sphere of security and defence,
including financial and economic aspects, will be included in the development and
execution of the National Program.

The Program will include specific projects for the development of the Armed
Forces, and in compliance with the Law on Defence and the Armed Forces, all
projects with value over BGN 100 million will be put forward for adoption by the
National Assembly.

All projects will seek to make maximal use of the mechanisms for common, joint
and multinational funding in addition to national financing as well as cooperation
with NATO and EU agencies in order to achieve interoperability at a minimal price,
offering an opportunity for integration of our defence industry and research sector
in the Euro-Atlantic community.

**II. EXTERNAL SECURITY ENVIRONMENT – RISKS AND THREATS TO BULGARIA’S SECURITY**

Contemporary strategic environment is characterised by dynamism, a wide
spectrum of challenges and changes, risks and threats hard to predict, including
asymmetric ones.

Today the Republic of Bulgaria is in one of the areas with the highest concentration
of risks and threats within the Euro-Atlantic community. **The trend in their**
**development is negative in the medium term and often in the long term.** A
source of considerable risks for our national security remains the instability of
neighbouring regions.

Heterogeneous regional and geostrategic interests suggest a continuation of the
trend of conflict and confrontation in the **Black Sea and Caucasus regions. The**
illegal annexation of Crimea by the Russian Federation and the conflict in Eastern
Ukraine has become one of the most serious threats to peace and security in Europe
since The Second World War. This has led to a serious change in the balance of
**power in the Black Sea region and has direct implications for Bulgaria’s**
**security.**

Increased investments in conventional capabilities in the above-mentioned region
and the “hybrid warfare model” highlight the necessity for adequate investments in
Bulgaria’s defence. This “hybrid warfare” blends conventional methods with
guerrilla warfare, secret support to separatist groups, cyber attacks and
propaganda, economic pressure and other activities contrary to international law.

Additional risks stem from the activation of existing **“frozen” conflicts near our**
**borders. Entering a spiral of sanctions already has a direct effect on our**
**national economic interests. Meanwhile Bulgaria is exceptionally dependent**
**on one source of energy. Therefore, diversification** of energy sources and
intensified cooperation within the EU is a key necessity for Bulgaria in order to
mitigate the negative economic consequences of the crisis to the east of our
country.

The dynamic development of crises in the **Middle East and North Africa have a**
destabilising effect both regionally and on a wider scale, thus seriously affecting
Bulgaria’s security and interests. Conflicts in Syria, Iraq (with the participation of
Al-Qaeda-affiliated and other radical groups such as “Islamic State”, al-Nusra Front,
and others), the Palestinian Territories, Libya, and the political and security


-----

**_Vision: Bulgaria in NATO and in European Defence 2020_**

instability in Egypt (particularly in the Sinai peninsula) and Lebanon are a source of
potential and genuine risks and threats for Bulgaria and other NATO and EU
Member States. Iran’s ambitions to develop a nuclear and missile program will
continue to be a risk for stability in both regional and global perspective.

One part of the risks to the Republic of Bulgaria is related to the situation in
**Afghanistan. Stabilisation of the security situation there is unlikely in the medium**
term, which means it will probably continue to generate risks for our country.

Existing potential risks related to the countries in the **Western Balkans** are
political and economic instability, tendencies towards separatism, a delay in their
integration in NATO and EU, challenges to what has already been achieved in their
democratic development, and the danger of losing a clear Euro-Atlantic perspective.
The region continues to generate risks to stability, including for Bulgaria, stemming
from ethnic and religious intolerance, as well as from deeply entrenched
nationalistic ideologies.

Additional interrelated risks for Bulgaria are:

**International terrorism** as a consequence of the activities conducted by Islamist
structures in countries in crisis regions. The return of jihadists who participated in
the conflicts in Syria and Iraq to their country of origin in Europe and the Western
Balkans creates risks not only for the security of these countries, but also for
Bulgaria and the region as a whole.

**The migration flow** is a challenge to national border protection systems and
capabilities related to integrating compact masses of people with a different
cultural background. It also necessitates a readjustment of national income in order
to assist persons looking for protection, and it also poses health risks. There is a
possibility that people of other risk categories, such as terrorism and various other
criminal activities, could take advantage of the refugee flow and could enter
Bulgaria. Increased immigration also presents a challenge the current legal
framework concerning such crises.

**Failed states and the lack of capacity of central authorities some MENA countries**
to carry out their functions create the conditions for the broadening of the positions
and activities of the various terrorist groups in the region, for the development of


-----

**_Vision: Bulgaria in NATO and in European Defence 2020_**

new extremist formations, the illicit traffic of arms, goods, and drugs, human
trafficking, as well as the destabilisation of communication, transport and energy
networks.

The constantly growing number and complexity of **cyber-attacks,** their complex
nature and highly destructive potential highlight the need for new approaches and
formats for intrainstitutional coordination and international cooperation in order
to achieve a much higher degree of interoperability and interaction with respect to
foreseeing and successfully dealing with this new threat.

The risks and threats identified above are a challenge to national security. Bulgaria
is not able to deal with them alone, and the only real way to effectively meet them is
to use the opportunities provided by our membership in NATO and the EU.
However, Allied solidarity does not mean that we can stop investing in our national
security. On the contrary, solidarity requires long-term political, economic and
financial commitment on the part of Bulgaria. We have to work on increasing the
interoperability of our armed forces and the flexibility and readiness of our whole
national security and defence system, in order to act adequately in a coalition
environment.

The adaptation and the need for **increased coordination between individual**
**institutions in the security sector and outside it require reforms, which can lead**
to a decisive change in current organisational culture. Of particular importance in
this respect is the ability of all competent ministries, agencies and state structures
to work in a coordinated manner under unified leadership in the respective fields,
with the aim to guarantee our national security within NATO and the EU.

**NATO and individual Member States are already conducting a review of the**
**definitively changed strategic security environment and are developing**
**specific measures, including adequate investments in the defence sector and**
**a Readiness Action Plan. It is imperative for Bulgaria to do the same. This**
**Vision reflects the position of the caretaker government on this issue. It is**
**developed in the context of the preparation for the forthcoming NATO**
**Summit.**

**ІІІ. DEFENCE INVESTMENTS IN SUPPORT OF ECONOMIC GROWTH AND**
**EMPLOYMENT THROUGH INNOVATIONS AND TECHNOLOGIES**


-----

**_Vision: Bulgaria in NATO and in European Defence 2020_**

Effective defence provides the security upon which favourable investment
environment is built. In parallel, the defence sector has direct positive effects on the
economy: annual production of the defence industry exceeds 0.5% of the relative
share of industrial output in the national GDP, with revenues exceeding BGN 600
million, of which approximately BGN 500 million worth of exports. A workforce of
more than 15 000 is employed by the defence industry and more than 90% of it is
highly qualified scientific and technical personnel. Additionally, the defence
industry also forms the basis of regional economies in many district centres,
especially in Central and Northern Bulgaria.

Investments in the defence sector have macroeconomic effects, which often exceed
those of other branches of the industry. According to a recent study conducted by
the European Defence Agency[1], at European level a reduction of EUR 100 million in
defence expenditure leads to EUR 150 million decrease in GDP, EUR 40 million drop
in revenues from taxes, and the loss of 3000 jobs, 800 of which highly qualified.

In the medium term, when properly allocated, investments in defence present a
considerable support to research and development. The three main vectors of
technologies of the future, with both military and civilian use, are Biotechnologies
(including nanotechnologies); Information and communication technologies, big
data, 3D printing; Provision of food, water, and energy resources.

In order to successfully develop these technologies, it is necessary to strengthen the
relationships between the economy, especially the private innovation ecosystem,
and the defence industry. Of particular interest are military projects that are also
applicable for civilian purposes. Thus, investments in defence will further promote
the development of already established clusters in the country, fostering their
national and international competitiveness. Technology specialisation in crisis
management and recovery, as well as in major technology areas like cyber security
and cyber defence, are examples of the role defence investments play in creating
innovation clusters. In order to maximise the value added, it is necessary to focus
on a limited number of major areas, to achieve a high technological level by
building on the existing experience.

**_Vision: Bulgaria in NATO and in European Defence 2020_**

**ІV. REINVESTING IN MODERN SECURITY AND DEFENCE: PRINCIPLES, POLICIES**
**AND CAPABILITIES**

Given the identified risks for our national security, and based on the underlying
economic logic calling for investment in sustainable growth and employment, it is
necessary to reinvest in defence capabilities, following certain principles, policies
and measures. Rapid development of modern and mission-capable Armed Forces
requires raising **the level of political ambition, backed by adequate funds that**
**the nation can dedicate to defence. These funds must be distributed in a way**
**allowing for modern equipment and highly motivated and trained units,**
**effectively integrated in both NATO and EU force structure. This will not only**
allow for the development and sustenance of operational capabilities that
effectively guarantee security, but will also bring positive economic impact to
society as a whole.

In today’s globalised world no nation can achieve effective defence independently
or in isolation. This is why Bulgaria considers its security solely and exclusively in
the context of NATO and the EU, with all the ensuing benefits and commitments to
shared security. A key element of this is the development of modern Armed Forces
under the **“NATO and EU First” policy approach, which is to be applied to all**
modernisation and training activities, and implies implementation of solutions
found within NATO and the EU through common, joint, and other multinational
funding.

Currently, and **given the rapidly evolving challenges of modern strategic**
**environment, without NATO Bulgaria does not have the necessary military**
**resources to effectively guarantee its security. This problem was clearly defined**
in the “White Paper on Defence and the Armed Forces” adopted by the National
Assembly in 2010. According to this document, the annual budget of the Ministry of
Defence in the 2010 – 2014 period should not have dropped below 1.5% of the
GDP. In this same period of financial austerity, however, the defence budget did not
reach even this minimum level required, and has fallen to a dangerously low
plateau (Fig. 1).


-----

**_Vision: Bulgaria in NATO and in European Defence 2020_**

-  Data from the White Paper 2010 and MoD Official Budgets 2011-2014

More than BGN 2 billion was spent on defence over the last ten years since joining
NATO and seven years of EU membership. This expenditure has only yielded
minimal new combat capabilities due to poor planning, management, and control,
lack of a National Defence Investment Programme, and a denial to make use in
practice of the mechanisms available through NATO and EU membership.

Taking into account the new strategic challenges identified above, the national
ambition of Bulgaria is to maintain a level of defence spending that is both
financially bearable to society and sufficient to ensure the effective security of
Bulgarian citizens. In order to achieve this, it is necessary that, **as early as 2015,**
**defence spending should reach the level of 1.5% of GDP, as set forth in the**
**document adopted by the National Assembly, and should increase each**
**subsequent year by 0.1 % of GDP, in order to reach 2.0% of GDP in 2020 (Fig.**
2).

This will have a significant positive twofold effect: on the one hand, it will allow the


-----

**_Vision: Bulgaria in NATO and in European Defence 2020_**

Armed Forces to develop into a modern, dynamic and viable organism that is
constantly adequate to the current dynamics of its environment. At the same time,
it will serve as a robust impetus to development of the defence industry and will
promote innovations, investment and economic development as a whole.

To lead however to the desired change, the increase of the defence budget should be
directed towards a tangible improvement of defence capabilities, while retaining
the basic force structure during this period. Given the broad spectrum of new
threats, this requires investment in modern technologies in order to develop a
**modern army, adequate to the challenges of today and tomorrow. Presently,**
capital expenditures account for a minor part of the defence budget, between 4%
and 5%, which is utterly insufficient to achieve this goal. Therefore, as part of the
overall increase in defence spending, the share of investments must rise to 15-20%
of the overall defence budget, building on the goals set out in the White Paper on
Defence 2010 (Fig. 3).

** Nominal GDP growth according to IMF forecasts (WEO, 2014)


** Nominal GDP growth according to IMF forecasts (WEO, 2014)

In order to keep our Armed Forces technologically adequate and to enhance the
positive economic impact, it will be necessary that until 2020 at least 1.5% of the
defence budget will be spent research and development.

Reinvestment in defence and its modernisation will result in strategic, economic
and political benefits for Bulgaria. Strategically and politically, it will enable us to
achieve the defence planning goals agreed upon in NATO, as well as to reduce our
dependence on countries outside NATO and the EU. Economically, it will invigorate


-----

**_Vision: Bulgaria in NATO and in European Defence 2020_**

our defence industry’s cooperation with companies from NATO and EU Member
States, as well as the development of innovation capacity in areas of specialisation
and the creation of highly qualified jobs. All this will maintain the favourable
security environment necessary for the prosperity of every citizen and the nation
as a whole.

**V. KEY PRINCIPLES FOR DEFENCE INVESTMENT**

The new strategic challenges require not only more resources, but also
reorganising the way in which these resources are utilised. The **new defence**
**management laid out in the White Paper and founded on the principles of good**
governance and capability based planning, needs to be further applied. In order to
**concentrate resources, it is of fundamental importance to integrate national**
defence planning with NATO’s, making use of initiatives such as Smart Defence and
the Connected Forces Initiative, while implementing a programme-driven and
results-oriented budget.

Capability development needs to be implemented in compliance with NATO’s
transformation, the NATO Defence Planning Process, NATO Education Training
Exercise and Evaluation, and the Concept Development & Experimentation, under
the leadership of the Ministry of Defence.

In this framework, the key elements of the vision for the Armed Forces are:

**Speed: Modern armed forces need to be capable of rapid and adequate deployment**
during crises at home, on the territory of an ally, or in another international
context. In addition to operational requirements, this entails that defence
management structure should become much more flexible and further
decentralised, and that more authority should be delegated within the
administration.

**Interoperability: Being a NATO and EU member, our capabilities can guarantee**
our security only combined with the capabilities of our allies. If we are to sustain
effective capabilities at Alliance level, we must ensure that the Bulgarian Armed
Forces have the same high technological level and professional skills as their peers
from the Allied forces.

**Communication and Transparency: In a world overwhelmed by traditional and**
new media, the security and normal functioning of society depends increasingly on
open and timely communication, both during crises and on a daily basis, with


-----

**_Vision: Bulgaria in NATO and in European Defence 2020_**

regard to continuously informing the public of the status of defence. This is why in
managing our defence projects we will apply maximum transparency and
oversight, together with close cooperation with NATO and the EU, applying these
organisations’ regulations, relevant to defence procurement.

**VI. KEY POLICIES FOR IMPLEMENTING THE VISION**

**Achieve as soon as possible and maintain the target of at least 15% of the**
**budget for capital investment. To this end, all the additional resources allocated**
for defence in 2015 must be directed towards raising capital investment to this
level. With a favourable economic growth, each subsequent year additional funds
are to be allocated for raising the level of capital investment by one percentage
point, thus reaching 20% for defence spending in 2020.

**Applying the “NATO and EU First” approach to defence policy. Being part of**
NATO and of the EU, Bulgaria must make full use of the collective defence industry
capabilities of these two organisations. To this end, we shall seek the maximum
degree of implementation of projects through the EU and NATO Agencies and by
existing solutions coming under NATO common funding arrangements.

**Linking and ensuring strict compliance of training and exercises with NATO**
**requirements.** To this end, as many exercises as possible must be conducted
within the framework of NATO and every Bulgarian soldier, sailor and airman must
fully meet the qualifying requirements for the respective field training, days at sea
or flying hours.

**Adapting personnel and maintenance costs in accordance with the increase in**
**the budget and its investment share. The force structure laid out in the White**
Paper on Defence 2010 will be preserved, striking the necessary balance between
the active personnel and the reserve. This is the only way for making possible the
allocation of sufficient funds for investment in modern equipment without
compromising on the training of our forces.

**Rationalising the processes and the organisational structure of the Ministry**
**of Defence in accordance with the successful modern models for defence**
**management and culture: the Ministry of Defence needs to be structured on the**
basis of processes promoting initiative, guaranteeing responsibility and
accountability, and maintaining transparency, which is of key importance for the
timely and effective response to quickly emerging modern threats.


-----

**_Vision: Bulgaria in NATO and in European Defence 2020_**

**Divesting from activities outside the core competences of the Ministry of**
**Defence in the area of resource management. All the activities of the Ministry of**
Defence in the field of commerce, procurement and property management will be
reviewed. The core activities pertaining to logistics and support will be part of a
uniform systemic approach to be developed by the competent authorities outside
the Ministry of Defence (for example, the Ministry of Economy and Energy).

**Developing a strategy for the national defence cluster, based on, and with the**
**support of the existing Industrial Forum. To this end, priority strands need to be**
identified (e.g. biotechnologies, cyber security, and energy). There is a need for a
specific plan, focusing on Bulgarian Defence Industry shift to areas of higher added
value and in closer cooperation with NATO and the EU and for an improved
competitiveness.

**VІІ. REQUIRED CAPABILITIES FOR MODERN DEFENCE**

Given the present and the projected future **strategic security environment**
described in this document and a clear understanding of the **importance of**
**defence for the economy and prosperity of our country, revealed in the national**
**ambition for adequate defence investments, the armed forces will work for the**
improvement of their capabilities through specific, critically necessary projects that
cover the areas of NATO’s hierarchical capabilities framework (prepare, project,
engage, sustain, C3, protect, inform) and the established NATO defence planning
framework (NDPP). This will be achieved by applying clear principles and directed
change management, while also seeking to maximise the positive effect for the
economy.

The choice of projects and the approach to their implementation is related to
Bulgaria’s active participation in the work of NATO and EU structures. In the first
place, the suggested capabilities are interoperable and correspond to the
technological level of our allies, which establishes the prerequisites for **effective**
collective defence. This will guarantee the provision of much of the Bulgarian
Armed Forces with modern equipment, alongside high morale and degree of
readiness. As equipping and supporting, a full spectrum of capabilities to these high
standards would require resources beyond those at our disposal, it is key to have
**clear priorities throughout the process of improving the Armed Forces in**
**accordance with the vision presented here.**


-----

**_Vision: Bulgaria in NATO and in European Defence 2020_**

The integration in NATO and EU structures, including through conforming to Allied
standards of project management and making optimal use of their agencies for joint
procurement and delivery, allows for active participation in projects by attracting
additional financial resources through NATO and EU mechanisms, and regional and
bilateral initiatives. Within this framework, Bulgaria will broaden its participation
in initiatives such as Smart Defence and Pooling and Sharing.

Priority capability areas include: Allied interoperability of key fighting equipment;
Command and control of deployed armed forces participating in

missions/operations abroad; mobility of land forces formations; anti-sea mines
operations; self-defence of fighter jets; intelligence, surveillance, and targeting;
nuclear, chemical, and biological protection.

In order to adequately and effectively meet the requirements of the strategic
environment, experts and servicemen have identified the need to invest in new
capabilities in all basic structures of the Bulgarian Army:

**AIR SOVEREIGNTY, OPERATIONS AND USE OF SPACE ENVIRONMENT**

An urgent necessity for the Bulgarian Air Force is the acquisition of a new type of
**_core multirole fighter aircraft and the required integrated logistic support._**
This acquisition will diminish the technological gap with our allies and
neighbouring NATO-member countries, as well as our dependence on Russia. The
new fighter jet will have the necessary capabilities for highly precise strikes and the
neutralisation of air, land, and maritime threats from military and field airports in
the country in the most complicated meteorological, operational, and cyber
environment. We will considerably improve the protection of military aircraft in
accordance with key allied standards, as well as our projection capabilities and the
level of interoperability with our allies in order to actively increase our
contribution to collective defence.

These goals can be achieved through national capabilities for more significant
investment, alongside a reduction in expenditures for out-of-date equipment and
its realisation in order to raise additional funds for modernisation. For the
modernisation of the surveillance systems (4-6 radars), we will seek funds through
the NATO Security Investment Program. Land-based air-defence structures will be
replaced within multinational NATO and EU projects and in accordance to available
funds.


-----

**_Vision: Bulgaria in NATO and in European Defence 2020_**

**MARITIME SECURITY AND OPERATIONS**

In this area, the main resources will be directed towards the modernisation of the
available class E-71frigates, including their equipment. This will improve the
capabilities of the Navy to participate in sea traffic surveillance and control
operations, detention of violators, detection and identification of nuclear, chemical
and biological agents and interchange of information in real time.

**_Modernisation of weapon systems of class E-71 frigates includes anti-ship_**
**_complex, anti-aircraft system and torpedo weapon system, 3-D radar,_**
**_unmanned helicopter and a combat information system._**

Anti-mine capabilities will be considerably improved including through the
establishment of a database centre, which will enhance the effectiveness and
exchange of information with analogous centres of other Allied nations.
Cooperation with the maritime forces of the Ministry of the Interior will
significantly improve our maritime security.

In case of successful financing through NATO, the EU and allied countries’
instruments, and provided favourable economic growth, we will initiate joint
projects for rapid development of the surveillance and reconnaissance capabilities
of our maritime forces while seeking close cooperation with the Ministry of the
Interior and the Ministry of Transport, IT and Communications for the integration
of surveillance systems and development of further patrolling capabilities. As outof-date battleships are decommissioned, we will begin to acquire a modular patrol
ship.

**LAND OPERATIONS**

Main priority for the Land Forces is the acquisition of new armoured fighting
vehicle with the associated assets, equipment and training for the build-up of the
declared Battalion Battle Groups. This will allow for missions in the full spectrum of
operations including night time operations and operations under extreme weather
conditions. At the same time, both mission readiness of the individual soldier and
the manoeuvrability, firepower and mobility of units in the operation zone must be
improved.

**Establishment of Battalion Battle Groups within mechanised brigades.**
**Equipment with 100-120 new combat vehicles and initial support for three**
**Battalion Battle Groups.**


-----

**_Vision: Bulgaria in NATO and in European Defence 2020_**

At the same time, these forces will acquire capabilities for communication,
reconnaissance, surveillance, targeting, coordination of movement and air support
through battlefield data and picture exchange. The acquisition of a terminal under
NATO’s Allied Ground Surveillance programme within a collaborative project with
fourteen other NATO Member States will be sped up and will be in initial
operational readiness in 2017.

**COMMAND AND CONTROL OF ARMED FORCES AND CYBER SECURITY**

The earlier acquisition of capabilities guaranteeing information security and
reliable cyber defence will allow for effective protection of the troops’ command
and control systems and of key infrastructure facilities in modern operations.

**Development of a centre for surveillance, analysis, reaction and recovery of**
**communication and information systems. Acquisition of a module for**
**communication and information support as part of a common project with**
**NATO.**

We will rapidly finalise a national cyber security strategy, which will serve as a
basis for a national organisational framework, the distribution of responsibilities,
and the coordination of interaction between operational, expert, and technical
functions. Within this, a key priority for the defence system is the development of a
centre for surveillance, analysis, reaction and recovery of communication and
information systems within the project “Cyber Defence”, along with the
development of an automated information system and the adaptation of field
control systems within the framework of NATO federated mission networking
(FMN).

**SPECIAL OPERATIONS, JOINT OPERATIONS, AND COMPREHENSIVE APPROACH**
**FOR CRISIS MANAGEMENT**

The Special Forces must be capable to act rapidly under the full spectrum of critical
conditions, which we are seeing ever more often in contemporary crises. They need
to be fully trained and equipped and, as is the case in most of our NATO Allies, to be
organised as an independent structure with its own headquarters and with a
mobile capability for command and control. In this area, we will prioritise
intelligence, early warning, and monitoring systems, including the acquisition of a
land terminal under NATO’s program for Allied Ground Surveillance (AGS).


-----

**_Vision: Bulgaria in NATO and in European Defence 2020_**

**Completion of the transformation of the Special Operations Forces in**
**accordance to strict NATO criteria and standards; Modernisation of the Joint**
**Operations Centre as a contemporary operations management centre;**
**Acquisition of reconnaissance, early warning, and monitoring systems.**

**Completion and establishment of the Centre of Excellence on crisis**
**management and recovery as a valuable part of the network of centres of**
**excellence within NATO and the first Alliance infrastructure of this kind on**
**Bulgarian territory.**

At the level of joint operations, there is need for capabilities for neutralising IEDs,
which will significantly improve force protection in modern operations. Protection
from nuclear, chemical, and biological weapons is of vital importance for successful
operations of the armed forces in the contemporary security environment.

It is necessary to continue the development and harmonisation of comprehensive
approach capabilities in operations and joint actions with other state institutions
and agencies, particularly in providing support to the authorities and the civilian
population following natural and man-made disasters.

Developing these capabilities will enable the force structure of the Bulgarian Armed
Forces to be affiliated to the elements of NATO’s force structure and EU’s
Battlegroups based on our experience in the NATO Rapid Deployment Corps in
Thessaloniki and the EU HELBROC Battlegroup. A priority in this area is joining the
group of countries with framework nation Germany for the development of
capabilities, as well as the Szczecin command (Poland) as the main command in
Eastern Europe.
