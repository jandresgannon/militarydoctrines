On the Publication of Defense of Japan 2019

Minister of Defense
**KONO Taro**

My name is Taro Kono. I took office as the Minister of Defense on September 11, 2019.
In order to ensure that the new Reiwa era will be a peaceful period, I will do my utmost to defend
Japanese national’s life and property by maintaining Japan’s peace and security and by contributing to
the effort to secure the peace and stability of the international community.
During the period covered by the 2019 version of the Defense White Paper, the Ministry of Defense
(MOD)/the Self-Defense Forces (SDF) made new developments related to defense policy, including
the formulation of the National Defense Program Guidelines for FY2019 and beyond (NDPG) and the
Mid-Term Defense Program (FY2019-FY2023; MTDP), and dealt with various incidents under the
leadership of former Minister of Defense Takeshi Iwaya. Therefore, he was also invited to offer his
words on the publication of this white paper.
We hope that Japanese nationals will take a look at the Defense White Paper and feel more familiar
with the MOD/SDF.

Former Minister of Defense
**IWAYA Takeshi**

On May 1 this year, the Reiwa era began. This year not only marks the beginning of a new era; it is
important for the MOD/SDF, as we will start to develop defense capabilities for a new age based on
the National Defense Program Guidelines for FY2019 and beyond (NDPG) and the Mid-Term Defense
Program (FY2019-FY2023; MTDP) that were formulated in December last year. The MOD/SDF will
continue to make every possible effort to perform tasks in order to preserve the peace and independence
of Japan in this new era.
The security environment surrounding Japan is becoming more testing and uncertain at a remarkably
faster speed than we expected. One particularly prominent change is the rapid expansion of the military

use of domains such as space, cyberspace and electromagnetic spectrum. As a result of technological
innovation in recent years, these domains are gaining as much importance as the conventional domains
of land, sea and air. As for the regional situation, China is expanding and stepping up its activities in
the seas and airspace neighboring Japan, with more and more fighters and bombers advancing to the
Sea of Japan and the Pacific Ocean. North Korea still maintains hundreds of ballistic missiles which
cover the whole of Japan within their range in combat deployment. The series of short-range ballistic
missile launches into the Sea of Japan since May indicates North Korea’s intent to advance relevant
technologies even after the US-NK leaders met three times, which we cannot overlook.
The most important point in preserving the peace and independence of Japan in this severe security
environment is our own effort. Under the NDPG and the MTDP, we will fundamentally strengthen our
own defense structure. In doing so, we intend to develop a “multi-domain defense force” that fusesthe
new domains of space, cyberspace and electromagnetic spectrum with the traditional domains of land,
sea and air.
The Japan-U.S. Alliance, along with Japan’s own defense system, forms the cornerstone of Japan’s
security. The range of fields where Japan and the United States should cooperate with each other is
expanding in accordance with the changing security environment. Since becoming Minister of Defense,
I have had five Japan-U.S. defense ministerial meetings, where we had candid discussions. By deepening
cooperation at all levels, from the summit level to the working level, we must strive to further strengthen
the deterrence and response capabilities of the Japan-U.S. Alliance. At the same time, we will make
efforts to mitigate the impact of bases on Okinawa and other host communities while maintaining the
deterrence capability of the U.S. Forces in Japan.
In addition, in order to realize the “Free and Open Indo-Pacific” vision, it is important to further
strengthen security cooperation with other countries while working together with the United States. We
intend to promote multi-faceted, multi-layered security cooperation among Australia, India, ASEAN
countries and others in a strategic manner.
At the beginning of the Defense White Paper for this year, a feature article titled “National Defense
Program Guidelines for FY2019 and beyond (NDPG)” provides explanations, using pictures and charts,
concerning the security environment and the strengthening of the defense system described in the
NDPG. In order to help readers deepen their understanding, the main body of the white paper includes
column articles providing clear explanations, in addition to a detailed description of the overview of the
NDPG and the MTDP.
At the beginning of the Reiwa era, looking back at the Heisei era, it was a period when the security
environment surrounding Japan changed dramatically. For example, Japan experienced the end of the
Cold War at the beginning of the era, followed by a series of natural disasters, the increased tension over
North Korea’s situation, the simultaneous terrorist attacks in the United States and the rise of China. In
this situation, we evolved the defense policy through such measures as participating in peacekeeping
operations in Cambodia and elsewhere, developing the Contingency Legislation, dispatching SDF
personnel to Iraq, and developing the Legislation for Peace and Security. For this year’s Defense White
Paper, we have prepared an opening feature titled “MOD/SDF in the Heisei Era: A Look Back on
Activities over the Past 30 Years” which helps readers to look back at the activities conducted by the
MOD/SDF during the Heisei era. I hope you will enjoy it.

**National Defense Program Guidelines**

**Feature1**

The most consequential responsibility of the Government of Japan is to maintain Japan’s peace and security, to ensure its survival
and to defend to the end Japanese nationals’ life, person and property and territorial land, waters and airspace. This is the foremost
responsibility that Japan must fulfi ll as a sovereign nation. Carrying out this responsibility by exerting efforts on its own accord and
initiative is at the very heart of Japan’s national security. Japan’s defense capability is the ultimate guarantor of its security and the
clear representation of the unwavering will and ability of Japan as a peace-loving nation. And maintaining Japan’s peace and security
is an essential premise for its prosperity.

**Security Environment Surrounding Japan**

At present, security environment surrounding Japan is changing at extremely high speeds. Changes in the balance of power in the international arena

are accelerating and becoming more complex, and uncertainty over the existing order is increasing.

Rapid expansion in the use of new domains, which are space, cyberspace and electromagnetic spectrum is poised to fundamentally change the existing

paradigm of national security, which has prioritized responses in traditional, physical domains, which are land, sea and air.

Japan, amid the dramatically changing security environment, needs to fundamentally strengthen its national defense architecture with which to protect,

by exerting efforts on its own accord and initiative, life, person and property of its nationals, territorial land, waters and airspace, and its sovereignty and

independence, thereby expanding roles Japan can fulfi ll.

Strengthening the Japan-U.S. Alliance as well as security cooperation with other countries are critical to Japan’s national security, and this cannot be

achieved without Japan's own efforts The international community also expects Japan to play roles that are commensurate with its national power

**National Defense Program Guidelines**

**Special**
**Feature1**

**Strengthening Japan’s Defense Capability**

Japan must squarely face the realities of national security and ensure necessary and sufficient quality and quantity so as to build a new defense

capability by a truly effective defense capability that does not lie on a linear extension of the past.

In particular, it has become essential that Japan achieve superiority in new domains, which are space, cyberspace and electromagnetic spectrum. To

build a new defense capability that combines strengths across all domains (Multi-Domain Defense Force), Japan needs to engage in a transformation at

a pace that is fundamentally different from the past, completely shedding the thinking that relies on traditional division among land, sea, and air.

**Strengthening Capabilities in the New domains of Space, Cyberspace and Electromagnetic Spectrum**

In order to realize cross-domain operations, the Self-Defense Forces (SDF) will acquire and strengthen capabilities in new domains, which are space, cyberspace
and electromagnetic spectrum.

**Electromagnetic domain**

**Space domain**

**Cyber domain**

in the new domains.

**Strengthening Sustainability and Resiliency**

To be able to sustain a range of requisite activities at all stages from peacetime to armed contingencies, the Ministry of Defense (MOD)/SDF will promote measures
necessary for enhancing sustainability and resiliency of defense capability including logistics support.

Equipment maintenance Equipment for restoring damaged runways

On the other hand, given the rapidly aging population with declining birthrates and severe fiscal situation, Japan cannot strengthen its defense

capability without thorough rationalization that does not dwell on the past.


**Reinforcing Human Resource Base**

The MOD/SDF will make efforts to secure human resources for and improve
the ability and morale of SDF personnel, which constitutes the core element
of defense capability.


**Reviewing Equipment Structure**

The MOD/SDF will examine the existing equipment structure from a joint
operation perspective and build an optimized equipment structure.


First Female Fighter Pilot Type-12 surface-to-ship guided missiles

In strengthening defense capability, Japan will enhance priority capability areas as early as possible, allocating resources flexibly and intensively

without adhering to existing budget and human resource allocation.

**Japan-U.S. Alliance and Security Cooperation**

The Japan-U.S. Alliance, together with Japan's own defense architecture, continues to be the cornerstone of Japan’s national security. Japan's

fulfi llment of its foremost responsibility as a sovereign nation is the very way to fulfi ll its roles under the Japan-U.S. Alliance and further enhance the

Alliance’s ability to deter and counter threats, and is a foundation upon which to strategically promote security cooperation in line with the vision of free

and open Indo-Pacifi c.

-  China has continued to reinforce its military capabilities both in quality and quantity. It has also continued its attempts to change the status quo in
the East and South China Seas, including the Senkaku Islands, which are inherent parts of the territory of Japan, and has intensifi ed its activities in
the Pacifi c Ocean and the Sea of Japan.

-  The second U.S.-North Korea summit was held, but there has been no change in the situation that North Korea possesses and deploys several
hundred ballistic missiles capable of reaching every part of Japan. North Korea also continues illegal transfers of goods at sea (so-called “ship-toship transfer”) through increasingly sophisticated methods in such areas as the East China Sea.

-  Russia carried out “Vostok 2018” in the Eastern Military District. The United States and Russia remained far apart regarding the Intermediate-Range
Nuclear Forces (INF) Treaty; following the United States’ announcement of withdrawal, the treaty lost effect in August 2019.

**MOD/SDF in the Heisei Era:**

**A Look Back on Activities over the Past 30 Years**

**Feature3**

April of this year marked the end of the Heisei era (the imperial era that lasted from 1989 through 2019). The Defense
White Paper for the fi rst year of the new Reiwa era introduces the history of the MOD/SDF during the Heisei era.

**A diver attaching an explosive to dispose of a sea mine**

After the Gulf War, a large number of mines laid by Iraqi troops remained in the Persian
Gulf. In order to secure the safe navigation of Japanese vessels, a minesweeper unit of
the Maritime Self-Defense Force (MSDF) was dispatched. This was the SDF’s fi rst
international cooperation since its establishment.

**Relief operation for Rwandan refugees (1994)**

**Security environment and the SDF’s initiatives**

**Great Hanshin-Awaji Earthquake (1995)**

**GSDF personnel engaged in search operations**

Up to about 19,000 SDF personnel per day engaged in disaster relief operations over a period of
approximately 100 days from the occurrence of the earthquake. Based on the lessons learned
through this activity, the disaster relief readiness was enhanced through measures including
amendment of various laws and strengthening of coordination with local governments.

With the fall of the Berlin Wall in 1989, the Cold War, which lasted
for more than 40 years, ended. The conventional structure of the
East-West military confrontation centering on the United States and
the Soviet Union was dissolved and the international situation took a
signifi cant turn. Under such circumstances, the SDF responded to
large-scale disasters, such as the Great Hanshin-Awaji Earthquake,
and also engaged in international peace cooperation activities, such
as PKO activities in Cambodia. The SDF increased its reputation in
and outside Japan and the roles of its defense capabilities
expanded.

**Tokyo subway sarin gas attack (1995)**

**GSDF personnel conducting decontamination work in a subway train**


An indiscriminate murder case using sarin gas in Tokyo subway stations and subway trains
occurred. Chemical protection units of the GSDF were dispatched to detect and
decontaminate the toxic gas at Kasumigaseki and Hibiya stations.

**Establishment of Special Action Committee on Okinawa (SACO) (1995)**

**The total return of MCAS Futenma stipulated in the SACO Final Report.**


The Japanese and U.S. governments agreed to establish the SACO in order to discuss various
issues concerning the facilities and areas of the United States Forces in Japan (USFJ) located
in Okinawa Prefecture.
SACO compiled the fi nal report in 1996, and agreed to return approximately 21% of the
facilities and areas of the USFJ located in Okinawa Prefecture at the time.

**Security environment and the SDF’s initiatives**

In the mid-Heisei era, dramatic changes occurred to Japan’s security environment. In particular, activities of international terrorist organizations became

serious, as represented by the 9/11 terrorist attacks. In addition, weapons of mass destruction and ballistic missiles became proliferated more widely,

and response to new threats and diverse situations posed challenges.

The SDF conducted replenishment activities on the Indian Ocean in order to deal with international terrorism as a member of the international

community. The SDF also engaged in activities for humanitarian and reconstruction assistance in Iraq, and international peace cooperation activities

came to be positioned as one of the SDF’s inherent duties along with the defense of Japan and the sustaining of public order.

In response to the threat of ballistic missiles, the SDF launched development of the Ballistic Missile Defense (BMD) system.

Piracy incidents were frequent and surging in waters off the coast of Somalia and in the Gulf
of Aden. In order to protect Japan-affi liated vessels from piracy, an order for Maritime
Security Operations was issued, and MSDF destroyers and aircraft were dispatched. After
that, the Anti-Piracy Measures Act was established, and not only Japanese vessels, but also
foreign vessels became subject to protection.

**Security environment and the SDF’s initiatives**


**Ⅰ**


In the late Heisei era, Japan’s security environment became increasingly severe due to changes in the balance of power associated with the growth of

China and India, and other reasons. Subsequently, various security issues and destabilizing factors became more visible and aggravated. As China’s

military activities became active, and North Korea’s development of nuclear weapons and ballistic missiles progressed, the SDF came to prepare against

unexpected contingencies by conducting persistent warning and surveillance activities in the waters and airspace around Japan, and deploying ballistic

missile defense units.

In addition, in order to respond to global issues that are diffi cult to address by a single country alone, the SDF also began to carry out international

activities, such as dispatching counter-piracy units and providing capacity building assistance to other countries’ military. On the other hand, inside

Japan, large-scale disasters, including the Great East Japan Earthquake, occurred in succession, and the SDF engaged in rescue operations and

livelihood support for victims.


**Announcement of new Guidelines (2015)**


**Establishment of the Legislation for Peace and Security (2015)**

**Training for the so-called “kaketsuke-keigo” operations**


At the Japan-U.S. “2+2” meeting held in the year marking 70 years after World War II, new
“Guidelines for Japan-US Defense Cooperation” (new Guidelines) refl ecting the changes in
the security environment and reinforcement of Japan-U.S. coordination in the fi eld of security
and defense was announced.

**Progress of North Korea’s nuclear and missile development (2016–2017)**

**Image publicly released by North Korea when it launched three Scud ERs (presumed)**

**(September 2016) [Jiji]**


North Korea conducted three nuclear tests and launched as many as 40 ballistic missiles
from 2016 to 2017.


With the establishment of the Legislation for Peace and Security, “survival-threatening
situation” was newly added to the situations to which Japan is to respond, and provisions
were introduced to enable “rescue of Japanese nationals overseas,” “protection of weapons
and other equipment of the units of the U.S. Forces and the armed forces of other foreign
countries,” and the so-called “kaketsuke-keigo.”

**Events indicating expansion and intensifi cation of the Chinese**

A submerged submarine of the Chinese Navy entered the contiguous zone around the
Senkaku Islands. The Chinese Navy’s vessels and air force are expanding and intensifying
their military activities in the Pacifi c Ocean and the Sea of Japan.


In December 2018, in order to respond to the new era, the “National Defense Program Guidelines for FY2019
and beyond (2018 NDPG)” was formulated as new guidelines defi ning how Japan’s national defense ought to be
to form the foundation of Japan’s future.

**more compact and higher-quality defense**

**NDPG :** **capabilities, and adding new roles**

- Japan formulated its fi rst NDPG in 1976. The 1976 NDPG adopted the concept of the Basic Defense Force, which aimed to maintain a
minimum-necessary defense force as an independent nation, preventing a power vacuum that would destabilize the region surrounding
Japan, under the Cold War structure.

- Although the Cold War ended in the beginning of the Heisei era, the international situation was still fraught with factors of instability and
uncertainty, and public expectations for international cooperation and disaster relief also grew. Based on such background, the 1995
NDPG were formulated.

- While basically following the concept of the Basic Defense Force, the 1995 NDPG aimed to promote more rational, effi cient, and compact
defense capabilities, and to achieve enhancement of necessary functions and qualitative improvement of defense capabilities. In addition,
“dealing with various contingencies such as major disasters” and “contributing to building a more stable security environment” were
added to the roles of defense capabilities alongside the “defense of Japan.”

the United States and North Korea’s ballistic missile development.

-  The 2004 NDPG shifted from the conventional policy attaching importance to the deterrence effect to a policy emphasizing response
capabilities. The Guidelines set forth that a “multifunctional, flexible, effective defense force” would be built in order to be able to
effectively respond to new threats and diverse situations and engage in international peace cooperation activities independently and
proactively. Meanwhile, the Guidelines maintained effective aspects of the concept of Basic Defense Capability.

including the military movements of North Korea and China, were becoming ever more complicated.

- Rather than the conventional concept of the Basic Defense Force, which emphasized deterrence based on the existence of the defense
force, the 2010 NDPG aimed to develop a Dynamic Defense Force focusing on “dynamic deterrence” whereby the State’s will and high
defense capabilities are indicated by conducting various activities in an appropriate and timely manner in peacetime. In that process,
drastic efficiency improvement and rationalization were to be achieved through fundamental review of equipment, personnel,
organization, deployment, etc.

**Chapter 1**

**P.41** **Overview**


**Characteristics of Current Security Environment** **P.41**


As uncertainty over the existing order is increasing, inter-state competition is becoming prominent across the political, economic and military
realms.
Gray zone situations are becoming persistent over a long period of time. “Hybrid warfare,” a method of altering the status quo that intentionally
blurs the boundaries between the military and non-military realms, is sometimes adopted.

Technological progress is about to fundamentally change how security should be managed.
Importance of domains of space, cyberspace, and electromagnetic spectrum; and game-changing technologies that could drastically change the
conduct of future warfare

Security challenges, which cannot be dealt with by a single country alone, are prominently emerging.
Security of maritime traffi c; securing stable use of new domains: space and cyberspace, response to proliferation of weapons of mass destruction
(WMDs); and response to regional confl ict and international terrorism

**Military Trends in the Neighboring Countries of Japan** **P.43**


The United States possesses the world’s largest comprehensive national power. The United States engages in rebuilding of its military power,
strengthens alliances and partnerships, and frames the Indo-Pacifi c as a priority region.

China is strengthening capabilities in the domains of space, cyberspace and electromagnetic spectrum in addition to nuclear, missile, naval and air
forces. China engages in unilateral, coercive attempts to alter the status quo based on its own assertions that are incompatible with existing
international order. In the East China Sea and other waters, China is expanding and intensifying its military activities at sea and in the air. Such
Chinese military developments represent a serious security concern.

North Korea has not carried out the dismantlement of all WMDs and ballistic missiles in a complete, verifi able and irreversible manner: there has
been no essential change in the country’s nuclear and missile capabilities. Such military trends in North Korea pose a serious and imminent threat
to the security of Japan.

Russia’s military activities are trending upward in the Far East. Continued attention needs to be paid to Russian military development.

**Chapter 2**

**P.47** **United States**


**Overview** **P.47**


The United States recognizes that the primary concern in U.S. security is strategic competition with China and Russia, which are revisionist
powers. Especially, the United States is sharpening its deterrence stance against China.

-  As an initial response to China’s continued militarization of areas in the South China Sea, the United States disinvited the Chinese navy to the
multilateral Rim of the Pacifi c Exercise (RIMPAC).

-  The U.S. forces carried out repeated Freedom of Navigation Operations in the South China Sea, transit through the Taiwan Strait, and bomber
fl ights over the South China Sea.

-  The United States imposed sanctions on a Chinese military organ and a leader.

-  The Unites States imposed tariffs on Chinese hi-tech products, heightened scrutiny of Chinese investment in the United States, and charged
espionage agents.

In a speech about the United States’ policy towards China, Vice President Mike Pence
mentioned an incident in which a Chinese naval vessel approached abnormally close to a
U.S. Navy vessel conducting Freedom of Navigation Operations. He went on to say that the
U.S. Navy will continue to fl y, sail, and operate wherever international law allows and U.S.
national interests demand.

The Trump administration’s stance on China has bipartisan support in Congress, which
appears likely to be maintained going forward.

Under the recognition that North Korea’s nuclear capabilities constitute a threat to the
United States, it has maintained sanctions and continues its efforts to pursue the **[Photo: courtesy of White House]**
denuclearization of North Korea, maintaining fi rm military readiness including through U.S.

**[Photo: courtesy of White House]**

**Trends in Security and Defense Policies** **P.47**


The United States has positioned the Indo-Pacifi c region as a priority region, and maintains a forward military presence in the region.In June 2019,
the United States released the Indo-Pacifi c Strategy Report (IPSR), indicating its policy to ensure combat-credible forces to be forward–postured in
the region, and reinforce and expand its alliances and partnerships, and evolve them to be networked.

The United States has been making efforts to maintain military advantages to deter and defeat aggression by great powers, requesting the largest
research and development budget in 70 years, and a 15% and 10 % year-on-year increase in the space-related budget and in the cyber-related
budget, respectively.

Regarding nuclear power, the United States released the Nuclear Posture Review (NPR) in February 2018. It indicates the policy that, in order to
deter across a spectrum of adversaries, threats and contexts, in addition to sustaining and replacing the nuclear triad (submarine-launched
ballistic missiles (SLBMs), intercontinental ballistic missiles (ICBMs) and strategic bombers), the United States will modify a small number of
existing SLBM warheads to provide a low-yield option.
In addition, the United States withdrew from the Intermediate-Range Nuclear Forces (INF) Treaty in
August 2019, claiming Russia’s material breach. President Trump also mentioned the need for arms
control involving China, which has beefed up medium-range missile capabilities outside the scope of
the INF Treaty.

Regarding missile defense, the Missile Defense Review (MDR) was published in January 2019. It notes
that North Korea has the ability to threaten the U.S. homeland with its nuclear missiles. It also pointed
out that Russia and China are developing advanced cruise missiles and hypersonic missiles that
challenge existing missile defense systems. Under this recognition, the MDR sets out a policy of
expanding and modernizing existing systems, and promoting development of new technologies taking
advantage of space.

President Trump instructed the Department of Defense (DoD) to start the necessary processes to
establish the Space Force. The DoD forwarded to Congress a legislative proposal to create the Space
Force within the Department of the Air Force.

**1** The Chinese Navy and Air Force have expanded and intensifi ed their activities in the surrounding sea areas and airspace of Japan, including the

area surrounding the Senkaku Islands. They are also conducting activities based on a unilateral claim on the Senkaku Islands, and cases involving
the one-sided escalation of activities have been seen, creating a situation of great concern to Japan.

**3** In the South China Sea, China is moving forward with militarization, as well as expanding and intensifying its activities in the maritime and aerial

domains by deploying aircraft. China continues unilateral efforts to change the status quo by coercion to create a fait accompli.

**Activities in Distant Seas** **P.77**


China is steadily increasing its capabilities to conduct operations in more distant seas such as the Indian Ocean in recent years.

While it is thought that the “Belt and Road” Initiative includes a strategic intention to expand its infl uence in the region, it is possible that the
construction of infrastructure based on the initiative will further promote the activities of the PLA in the Indian Ocean, Pacifi c Ocean and elsewhere.
Furthermore, the Chinese military is possibly taking on the role of the shield behind the initiative by such means as the stabilization of areas via
counter-piracy activities and joint exercises.

**Relations with Countries and Regions** **P.81**


While the United States has been toughening its stance on China, China has
maintained an uncompromising stance on its “core interests.” Concerning trade
and military issues, developments feeding mutual antagonism emerged between
the United States and China.

-  Raising of import tariffs by China as countermeasures against the same
measures by the United States

-  Abnormally close approach by a Chinese naval vessel to a U.S. Navy vessel
conducting Freedom of Navigation Operations in the South China Sea, etc.

It has been confirmed that regarding military exchange, which has remained
stable in recent years, there are activities indicating a possible change. [Jane’s by IHS Markit]

the “Belt and Road” Initiative, due to such factors as their deteriorating fi nancial Abnormal approach by a Chinese naval vessel to a U.S. Navy vessel, reportedly

Regarding Taiwan, since the inauguration of the Tsai administration, fi ve countries severed diplomatic relations with Taiwan, while they established
relations with China. While the United States has continued and reinforced its engagement in Taiwan, China has repeatedly expressed its strong
protest against Taiwan’s independence.

The overall military balance between China and Taiwan is shifting in favor of China, and the gap appears to be growing year by year.

**P.92** **North Korea**


**Overview** **P.92**


North Korea has repeatedly expressed the intention to work towards denuclearization at
the U.S.-North Korea summit meeting in June 2018 and other occasions.
North Korea has announced the suspension of nuclear tests and test-fi ring of ICBMs, and
publicly destroyed the Punggye-ri nuclear test site. Moreover, North Korea announced
that it will dismantle the missile engine test site and launch platform in the Tongch’ang-ri
district in the future, and that it will close the nuclear facilities in Yongbyon if the United
States lifts sanctions.

On the other hand:

-  It is assessed that North Korea has already miniaturized nuclear weapons to fi t ballistic
missile warheads;

-  North Korea possesses and deploys several hundred ballistic missiles capable of
reaching, every part of Japan and

-  North Korea continues to possess capabilities for conducting surprise attacks against
Japan utilizing a Transporter-Erector-Launchers (TEL) and submarines.

In light of the above, there has been no essential change in North Korea’s nuclear and
missile capabilities. Military trends in North Korea continue to pose a serious and
imminent threat to the security of Japan.

It is now necessary to keep close watch on what kind of concrete actions North Korea
will take towards the dismantlement of nuclear weapons and missiles.




**[AFP/Jiji]**



**[Korean News Service/Jiji]**


**Current Status of the Nuclear and Missile Development** **P.94**


The possibility cannot be discounted that the sixth nuclear weapons test in September 2017 was of a hydrogen bomb.

Given the technological maturity obtained through the past six nuclear tests, it is assessed that North Korea has already miniaturized nuclear
weapons to fit ballistic missile warheads. In May, July and August 2019, North Korea launched a new type of short-range ballistic missiles
(presumed) and others nine times toward the Sea of Japan.

Regarding ballistic missiles, North Korea aims to:

1. increase the fi ring range of ballistic missiles; 2. enhance the accuracy and operation capabilities necessary for saturation attacks;

3. improve its ability to conduct surprise attacks; and 4. diversify the forms of launches.

**Ship-to-Ship Transfer** **P.108**


North Korea is presumed to be evading the United Nations (UN) Security Council
sanctions by conducting ship-to-ship transfers in the high seas, which are forbidden
under the terms of the UN Security Council resolutions. It is pointed out that illegal
ship-to-ship transfers of oil products and coal by North Korea were increasing
rapidly.

**Trends in the Vicinity of Japan** **P.125**


Russia appears to be stepping up military activities not only in the Arctic, Europe, areas near the United States, and the Middle East, but also in the
Far East, so close scrutiny of developments in this regard will be required.

The number of scrambles against Russian aircraft in the Far East has remained high. In addition, Russian aircraft intruded into Japan’s territorial
airspace in June and July 2019.

Regarding the Northern Territories, Russia announced that it deployed surface-to-ship missiles to Etorofu and Kunashiri Islands in 2016. It is
reported that three Su-35 fi ghter aircraft were deployed in Etorofu Island in 2018, showing a military build-up by Russia.

In the large-scale Vostok 2018 exercise, in addition to units of the Eastern Military District, units of the Central Military District and the Northern
Fleet participated. Notable features of this year’s exercise were that the size was considered the largest since the time of the Soviet Union, and
that China and Mongolia participated for the fi rst time.

**Modernization of Nuclear Forces and Development of New Weapons** **P.120**


In order to supplement its inferiority in conventional forces and to
strike a balance with the nuclear forces of the United States,
Russia has prioritized the modernization of nuclear forces. Under
the recognition that the United States’ installation of missile
defense systems both at home and abroad undermines the balance
of nuclear forces, Russia is moving forward with the development
of new weapons such as the Avangard hypersonic glide vehicle
(HGV) that are said to be capable of reliably penetrating the
systems.

The United States provided notice of its intention to withdraw from
the INF Treaty, and announced its intention to develop surfacelaunched intermediate-range missiles capable of carrying
conventional warheads. In response, Russia announced plans to

as an asymmetrical means to impede the military activities of adversaries
at low cost. Many foreign military forces are developing offensive
capabilities in cyberspace.

**2** It has been pointed out that China and Russia are bolstering the offensive

cyber capabilities of their militaries for the purpose of obstructing the
network of military forces and destroying infrastructure.

**3** Cyber attacks have frequently been carried out against information and

communications networks of government organizations and military
forces of various countries. Government agencies such as those in
Russia, China, and North Korea are suspected of engaging in some cyber

-  Changes in the balance of power are accelerating and becoming more complex, thereby increasing uncertainty over the existing order.

-  Rapid expansion in the use of the new domains of space, cyberspace and electromagnetic spectrum is poised to fundamentally change the existing
paradigm of national security, which has prioritized responses in the domains of land, sea and air. In addition, qualitatively and quantitatively superior
military powers concentrate in Japan’s surroundings where clear trends are observed in increase in military activities.

**Japan’s Basic Defense Policy** **P.214**


The following are set forth as national defense objectives:

-  to create, on a steady-state basis, a security environment desirable for Japan by integrating and drawing on the strengths at the nation’s
disposal;

-  to deter threats from reaching Japan by making opponents realize that doing harm to Japan would be diffi cult and consequential; and

-  should a threat reach Japan, to squarely counter the threat and minimize damage.
Under the basic precept of maintaining an exclusively defense-oriented policy, Japan will strengthen each
of the means by which to successfully achieve these national defense objectives: Japan’s own architecture
for national defense; the Japan-U.S. Alliance; and international security cooperation.

**1** **Strengthening Japan’s Own Architecture for National Defense**

-  Under the recognition that defense capability is the most important strength for Japan in retaining
self-sustained existence as a sovereign nation amid a security environment that it has never faced

**Defense of Japan’s Remote Islands**

**1** In response to attack on Japan including its remote islands, the SDF will quickly maneuver and

deploy requisite units to block access and landing of invading forces while ensuring maritime and
air superiority. Even when maintaining maritime and air superiority becomes untenable, the SDF will
block invading forces’ access and landing from outside their threat envelopes. Should any part of
the territory be occupied, the SDF will retake it by employing all necessary measures.

**2** For defense posture buildup in the southwestern region, the Ground Self-Defense Force (GSDF)

deployed some units, including an area security unit in Amami Oshima, and an area security unit in
Miyakojima Island, in March 2019. The GSDF will deploy an area security unit and other units also in
Ishigakijima Island. Amphibious vehicle training landings in Iron Fist 19 (from

January to February 2019)

**3** The SDF started research and development on technologies required for new anti-ship missiles and

Hyper Velocity Gliding Projectiles (HVGPs) for the defense of remote islands to take all initiatives necessary to defend the islands since FY2018.

**4** In order to secure capabilities for swift and large-scale transportation and deployment of units, initiatives are underway to enhance rapid

deployment capabilities through: the improvement of Landing Ship, Tank; and the introduction of V-22 Ospreys and C-2 transport aircraft.

**Response to Missile Attacks**

**1** Currently, Japan’s Ballistic Missile Defense (BMD) is an effective multi-layered defense system with the upper tier interception by Aegis equipped

destroyers and the lower tier by Patriot PAC-3, both interconnected and coordinated by the Japan Aerospace Defense Ground Environment
(JADGE).

**2** The upcoming introduction of the land-based Aegis system, Aegis Ashore, will enable our forces to intercept missiles in the upper tier not just from

Aegis destroyers but from land.

**3** In order to counter increasingly complex and diverse airborne threats and minimize damage, the SDF will establish a structure with which to

conduct integrated operation of various equipment pieces, including those for missile defense as well as air defense equipment, and thereby
provide persistent nation-wide protection from peacetime. It will also enhance its comprehensive air and missile defense capability so that it can
simultaneously deal with multiple, complex airborne threats.


**Responses in the Domains of Space, Cyberspace and Electromagnetic Spectrum** **P.289**


**Responses in Space Domain**

**Chapter**


**Section**
**1** **Characteristics of Current Security Environment**


What is notable about the current security environment is
fi rst of all that interdependency among countries is further
expanding and deepening. On the other hand, thanks to
further growth of the national power of such countries as
China, changes in the balance of power are accelerating
and becoming more complex. In addition, uncertainty over
the existing order is increasing. Against such a backdrop,
prominently emerging is inter-state competition across the
political, economic and military realms, in which states seek
to shape global and regional order to their advantage as well
as to increase their infl uence.
Such inter-state competition occurs on a continuous
basis. In conducting inter-state competition, states leverage
various means such as undermining another country’s
sovereignty using military and law-enforcement entities, and
manipulating a foreign country’s public opinion by exploiting
social media. In the competition, methods employed to alter
the status quo, such as “hybrid warfare,” that intentionally
blur the boundaries between the military and non-military
realms is sometimes adopted. These methods combine
operations using anonymous units concealing their
nationality, cyber attacks against communications and critical
infrastructure, and information manipulation campaigns
through distribution of false information via the internet and
other media. The methods are forcing affected actors to take
complex measures not limited to military ones.
Also, as a result of the use of various methods, including
hybrid warfare, so-called gray-zone situations, which are
neither purely peacetime nor contingency situations, are
becoming persistent over a long period of time, playing out
as part of inter-state competition. They may possibly further
increase and expand. Such gray-zone situations harbor the
risk of rapidly developing into graver situations without
showing clear indications.
Secondly, technological progress is about to fundamentally
change how security should be managed. Against the
backdrop of the advance of military technology due to rapid
technological innovation in information & communications
and other fi elds, contemporary warfare increasingly features
capabilities combined across all domains: not only land sea


and air but also new domains, which are space, cyberspace
and electromagnetic spectrum. Aiming to improve overall
military capability and acquire asymmetric military
capability that effectively prevents opponents with superior
overall military capability from exercising their strengths,
states are seeking to gain superiority in technologies that
undergird capabilities in new domains.
States endeavor to develop weapons that leverage cuttingedge, potentially game-changing technologies that could
drastically change the conduct of future warfare. Specifi cally,
major powers such as the United States, China and Russia
are believed to be focusing on the research and development
of unmanned technologies, artifi cial intelligence (AI)
technologies, hypersonic technologies that are necessary for
the development of Hypersonic Glide Vehicles (HGV) and
Hypersonic Cruise Missiles (HCM), and high-power laser
technologies, among other technologies. Meanwhile, nonstate actors and countries without advanced technologies
may be attempting to develop and acquire means for
asymmetrical attack, such as weapons of mass destruction
(WMDs) and cyber capabilities, and obtain the technologies
of developed countries through illicit means in order to make
up for their disadvantages.
Progress in military technology relies heavily on
the development of civilian technologies as well as
technological development in the military fi eld. It is believed
that the development and international transfer of civilian
technologies will have a major impact on improvements in the
military capabilities of each country. Further technological
innovations hereafter are expected to make it diffi cult still to
foresee future warfare.
Thirdly, expanded and deepened interdependency among
countries are raising the risk that a confl ict or other security
issue in a country or region will soon grow into a destabilizing
factor that could affect the entire international community.
The following security challenges, which cannot be dealt
with by a single country alone, are prominently emerging.

**(1) Security of Maritime Traffi c**

In the maritime domain which has been regarded as a


-----

foundation for supporting international trade, there have
been cases where a country unilaterally claims its entitlement
and takes actions based on its own assertions that are
incompatible with the existing international order, thereby
unduly infringing upon the freedom of navigation in high
seas and of overflight. In addition, piracy acts have taken
place in various parts of the world.
In response to these situations, the international community
has been taking various measures, such as collaborating to
protect the existing international order based on law including
a free and open maritime order, and implementing initiatives
designed to avoid and prevent unexpected situations in the
maritime domain and airspace. In addition, the international
community is continuing to conduct anti-piracy operations
in Asia and Africa.

**(2) Securing Stable Use of New Domains: Space and**
**Cyberspace**

Recently, securing the stable use of new domains such as
space and cyberspace, in addition to the conventional domains
of the land, sea, and air, has become an important challenge
for the security of the international community. The further
development of military technology along with significant
advancements in Information and Communications
Technology (ICT) has increased the dependence of social
infrastructure and military activities on space and cyberspace.
On the other hand, the development of anti-satellite weapons
by countries and the great occurrence of cyber attacks with
suspected government involvement have exacerbated the
risks to the stable use of space and cyberspace. In recent
years, countries are moving ahead with specific efforts
aimed at acquiring the capabilities to monitor threats to space
assets such as satellites and a reinforcement of their ability
to combat cyber attacks, including private sector companies.
There are also moves seen in the international community to
promote the rule of law in space and cyberspace, including
an establishment of certain norms of behavior.


a Russian-made military-grade nerve agent, was used, and
that it was highly likely that Russia was responsible for the
attack on a former Russian intelligence agent that occurred
in the United Kingdom in March 2018. Concerning the
situation in Syria, in April 2017, the United States determined
that the Assad regime used chemical weapons in an attack
on a region in the south of Idlib Governorate in northwest
Syria controlled by anti-government forces, and in response
launched a missile strike on Shayrat Airbase, the base of the
planes used in the Assad regime’s attack which is believed to
be housing chemical weapons. Furthermore, in April 2018,
the United States, United Kingdom and France determined
that the Assad regime used chemical weapons against
civilians once again in Eastern Ghouta on the outskirts of
Damascus, the capital of Syria, and in response they launched
a missile strike on three chemical weapons-related facilities,
demonstrating resolve to stop the use and proliferation of
chemical weapons.
In addition, there are continuing concerns about the
acquisition and use of WMDs by non-state actors, such
as international terrorist organizations. In this regard, the
international community continues to pursue efforts to
counter terrorism activities that utilize nuclear materials and
other radioactive substances.

**(4) Response to Regional Conflict and International Terrorism**

There are underlying differences in the nature of conflicts
occurring around the world. In the case of prolonged
conflicts, it is believed there is a rising possibility that human
rights violations, refugees, starvation, and poverty occurring
as a result of conflict will affect a much broader area than the
countries involved.
Meanwhile, mainly in the Middle East and Africa, there are
prominent examples where geographic blind spots without
government control in vulnerable nations with unstable
political situations and weak governance capabilities have
become a hotbed for the activities of international terrorist
organizations.
Terrorist organizations are carrying out activities across
national borders while obtaining personnel, weapons and
financial resources by taking advantage of vulnerable border
controls. Also, in European and North American countries,
there is growing concern over the threat of terrorism posed
by persons who sympathize with violent extremist thoughts
propagated by international terrorist organizations or by
persons returning to their home country after fighting
in conflict zones. Taking into account that the extremist
organization Islamic State in Iraq and the Levant (ISIL)
has repeatedly cited that Japanese nationals are a target of
its terrorist attacks, and that Japanese nationals died in the


**Chapter**


**(3) Response to Proliferation of WMDs**

The proliferation of WMDs, such as nuclear, biological,
and chemical (NBC) weapons, and of ballistic missiles that
serve as the means of delivery of WMDs is still viewed as a
significant threat to the international community, including
East Asia. As for chemical weapons, the Malaysian police
announced that VX, a chemical whose production and use
is banned under the Chemical Weapons Convention (CWC),
was detected from the body of Kim Jong-Nam following his
assassination that occurred in Malaysia in February 2017.
Additionally, the then U.K. Prime Minister Theresa May
made a statement which said that it was clear that Novichok,


-----

terrorist attack on a restaurant in Dhaka, Bangladesh, that
occurred in July 2016 as well as the large-scale bombings
in Sri Lanka that occurred in April 2019, the threat of
international terrorism must be considered a problem facing
Japan, too.
In this manner, there is a growing risk that the impact
of regional conflict and threat of terrorism will spread
as a factor of instability affecting the entire international
community, not just a single country or single region. It is
important for members of the international community to
review approaches to international frameworks and their
involvement based on their respective characteristics and to
seek out appropriate responses. As for regional conflicts, the
mission of United Nations (UN) peacekeeping operations
has expanded to a wide range of fields including civilian
and policing activities: supervision of disarmament, security

**Section**
**2** **Military Trends in the Neighboring Countries of Japan**


Qualitatively and quantitatively superior military powers
concentrate in Japan’s surroundings where clear trends are
observed in further military build-up and increase in military
activities.
The Indo-Pacific region, including Japan, abounds in
political, economic, ethnic, and religious diversity. Also,
views on security and perceptions of threats are different
by country. Therefore, a regional cooperation framework in
the security realm has not been sufficiently institutionalized,
and longstanding issues of territorial rights and reunification
continue to remain in the region.

In the Korean Peninsula, the Korean people have
been divided for more than half a century, and the faceoff
continues between the military forces of the Republic of
Korea (ROK) and North Korea. There are issues concerning
Taiwan and the South China Sea. Furthermore, with regard
to Japan, territorial disputes over the Northern Territories and
Takeshima, both of which are inherent parts of the territory
of Japan, remain unresolved.
On top of this, recent years have seen a continued tendency
towards the prolongation of “gray-zone” situations—which
are neither purely peacetime nor contingency situations—
as part of state-to-state competition, and it is possible that
those situations may increase and expand. The gray-zone
situations harbor the risk of rapidly developing into graver
situations without showing clear indications.


force reforms, election and government monitoring, and
humanitarian assistance such as refugee repatriation. In
particular, there is growing importance placed on missions
for protecting civilians and women and for peace building.
Additionally, there are examples in which multinational
forces and regional institutions authorized by the UN Security
Council are working for conflict prevention, peacekeeping
and peacebuilding.
In terms of international counterterrorism, there is growing
importance for international cooperation due to the spread
of activities by terrorist organizations across international
borders. At present, in addition to the use of military means,
the entire international community is taking initiatives to
block sources of financing for terrorist organizations and to
prevent the international transfer of terrorists.

state competition in a range of areas prominently emerging,
has acknowledged that a particularly important challenge is
strategic competition with China and Russia, who attempt to
alter global and regional order.
To rebuild its military power, the United States is engaged in
such efforts as maintaining military advantage in all domains
through technological innovations, enhancing nuclear
deterrence, and advancing missile defense capabilities. The
United States upholds defense commitments to allies and
partners, and maintains forward force presence, while calling
on them to share greater responsibility. The United States

frames the Indo-Pacific as a priority region where it adopts a
policy of strengthening alliances and partnerships.
Member states of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization
(NATO), including the United States, are reviewing their
strategies to deal with coercive attempts to alter the statusquo as well as “hybrid warfare.” In view of changes in the
security environment, NATO member states have been
increasing their defense expenditures.


**Chapter**


**(2) China**

With an aim to build “world-class forces” by the mid21st century, China has sustained high-level growth of
defense expenditures with continued lack of transparency.
China has engaged in broad, rapid improvement of its
military power in qualitative and quantitative terms with
focus on nuclear, missile, naval and air forces. China
is also strengthening capabilities in new domains that
are essential for modern military operations, including
space, cyber and electromagnetic domains. China is also


**(1) The United States**

While remaining to possess the world’s largest
comprehensive national power, the United States, with inter

-----

improving missile defense penetration capabilities and
amphibious landing capabilities. China is also improving
missile defense penetration capabilities and amphibious
landing capabilities. Such capability enhancement serves
to improve the so-called Anti-Access/Area Denial (“A2/AD”)
capabilities—capabilities to deny access and deployment
of foreign militaries to one’s surrounding areas and to
disrupt their military operations therein—as well as to build
capabilities with which to conduct military operations over
greater distances. In addition, China is promoting CivilMilitary Fusion policy in areas of national defense, science
& technology and industry, and actively developing and
acquiring cutting-edge technologies of potential military
utility.
China engages in unilateral, coercive attempts to alter the
status quo based on its own assertions that are incompatible
with existing international order. In the East China Sea
and other waters, China is expanding and intensifying its
military activities at sea and in the air. Around the Senkaku
Islands, an inherent part of Japanese territory, despite Japan’s
strong protests, Chinese government vessels continually
violate Japanese territorial waters, and Chinese naval ships
continuously operate in waters around the Islands. China
has already been indicating its policy of strengthening
cooperation between the navy and the maritime lawenforcement division in order to protect its maritime interests.
As an example of the strengthening of the cooperation, in July
2018, the China Coast Guard to which Chinese government
vessels repeatedly intruding into Japanese territorial waters
belonged were integrated into the People’s Armed Police,
which are under the unified command of the Central Military
Commission.
China is also expanding its military activities in the
Pacific Ocean and the Sea of Japan. In particular, the
Chinese military in recent years has frequently advanced to
the Pacific, with its navigation routes and unit composition
becoming more diverse. In the South China Sea, China
has forcibly conducted large-scale, rapid reclamation of
maritime features, which are being converted into military
footholds. China in the South China Sea is also expanding
and intensifying its maritime and air activities.
Such Chinese military and other developments, coupled
with the lack of transparency surrounding its defense policy
and military power, represent a serious security concern
for the region including Japan and for the international
community. Japan needs to continue to pay utmost attention
to these developments. China is eagerly expected to play


active roles in a more cooperative manner in the region and
the international community.

**(3) North Korea**

North Korea in recent years has launched ballistic missiles at
unprecedented frequency, rapidly improving its operational
capabilities, such as simultaneous launch and surprise
attack. Given technological maturity obtained through a
series of nuclear tests, North Korea is assessed as having
already successfully miniaturized nuclear weapons to fit
ballistic missile warheads. Although North Korea expressed
its intention for complete denuclearization of the Korean
Peninsula and blew up its nuclear test site in public, it has
not carried out the dismantlement of all weapons of mass
destruction and ballistic missiles of all ranges in a complete,
verifiable and irreversible manner: there has been no essential
change in North Korea’s nuclear and missile capabilities.
North Korea is assessed as possessing large-scale cyber
units as part of its asymmetric military capabilities, engaging
in theft of military secrets and developing capabilities to
attack critical infrastructure of foreign countries. North
Korea also retains large-scale special operation forces.
Such military developments of North Korea pose serious
and imminent threats to Japan’s security and significantly
undermine the peace and security of the region and the
international community. Also, through UN Security Council
resolutions, the international community made it clear that
North Korea’s nuclear- and ballistic missile-related activities
constitute a clear threat to international peace and security.
As for North Korea’s abduction of Japanese nationals,
the utmost efforts continue to be made to realize the return
of all abductees to Japan as quickly as possible by close
cooperation with related countries including the US.


**Chapter**


**(3) Russia**

It is deemed that Russia has promoted the strengthening
of the readiness of its Armed Forces and the development
and acquisition of new equipment, while giving priority to
modernizing its nuclear force from the viewpoint of making
up for its disadvantage in terms of conventional weapons in

**KEY WORD**


“Anti-Access/Area-Denial” [“A2/AD”] capabilities

Anti-Access (A2) is a concept introduced by the United States. It refers to
capabilities, usually long-range, designed to prevent an opposing force from
entering an operational area. Area-Denial (AD) refers to capabilities, usually
of shorter range, designed to limit an opposing force’s freedom of action
within the operational area. Weapons used for A2/AD include ballistic
missiles, cruise missiles, anti-satellite weapons, air-defense systems,
submarines, and mines.

addition to securing its international position and maintaining
the nuclear power balance with the United States.
Russia’s military activities are trending upward in the
Arctic Circle, Europe, areas around the United States and the
Middle East, as well as in the Far East, including Japan’s
Northern Territories. Specifically, Russia changed the status
quo using force by engaging in so-called “hybrid warfare”[1]
in Ukraine, which Russia regards as a part of its sphere of
influence. Therefore, this is recognized as not only a strong
concern for European countries, but also a global issue that
could potentially engulf the entire international community,
including Asia. Russia is also appearing to be expanding its
influence internationally, including through its involvement
in the Syria Civil War as a supporter of the Assad regime.
In the Far East, the number of scrambles by Air SelfDefense Force (ASDF) aircraft against aircraft of the
Russian Armed Forces has remained at a high level, and
in this region, the Russian Armed Forces have conducted
large-scale exercises. Russia has unveiled the deployment of
coastal (surface-to-ship) missiles in the Northern Territories,
and there have been media reports about the start of the
deployment of fighter aircraft on Etorofu Island, indicating
Russia’s efforts to enhance armaments in the region.
Therefore, continued attention needs to be paid to Russian
military development in the Far East, including the Northern
Territories.
As seen above, in the Asia-Pacific region, where the
security environment has increasingly grown severe, the


presence of the U.S. Forces remains extremely important
in order to achieve regional stability. Accordingly, Japan
and other countries, such as Australia and the ROK, have
established bilateral alliances and partnerships with the
United States, and allow the stationing and rotational
deployment of the U.S. Forces in their territories. In regard
to the responses to the unilateral changes in the status quo by
force or coercion based on unique assertions, it is important
for the international community centered around countries in
the region to make concerted efforts to protect the existing
international order based on law.
Meanwhile, countries in the region have made efforts
to enhance and strengthen specific and practical intraregional coordination and collaboration with a particular
focus on non-traditional security fields such as humanitarian
assistance and disaster relief. Opportunities for bilateral
defense exchanges between countries in the region have
increased in recent years. Multilateral security dialogues,
including the ASEAN Defense Ministers’ Meeting-Plus
(ADMM-Plus), the ASEAN Regional Forum (ARF),
conferences hosted by nongovernmental institutions with the
participation of relevant defense ministers, and bilateral and
multilateral exercises are held. Promoting and developing
such multilayered approaches among countries is also
important to ensure stability in the region.

**Defense Policies of Countries**

**Section**
**1** **The United States**


**1** **Security and Defense Policies**


**Chapter**


It has been pointed out that the Trump administration,
which was inaugurated in January 2017, has signifi cantly
changed the patterns of U.S. involvement in the world under
the “America First” policy. On the other hand, it can be
considered that while the United States is focusing on global
competition, the United States has been continuing to play
a role for world peace and stability with its comprehensive
national power, the largest in the world, based on its belief
that the values and infl uence of the United States, bolstered
by its power, would make the world freer, safer, and more
prosperous.
In fact, the United States has clarifi ed its stance that it
will emphasize the security of the Indo-Pacifi c region and
has clearly indicated its willingness both to build new and
stronger bonds with nations that share its values across the
region and to maintain a forward military presence in the
region, in order to advance the U.S. vision of a free and
open Indo-Pacifi c. After positioning China as a revisionist
power and strategic competitor in a strategy document
outlining the administration’s national security and national
defense policy, the United States disinvited China to the Rim
of the Pacifi c (RIMPAC) exercise. It is reported that U.S.
naval vessels carried out repeated “Freedom of Navigation
Operations” in the South China Sea and transit through the
Taiwan Strait, and that the United States imposed sanctions
on a Chinese military organ and a leader. The United States is
also sharpening its deterrence stance against China through
such moves as imposing tariffs on Chinese hi-tech products,
heightening scrutiny of Chinese investment in the United
States, restricting exports of U.S. technologies to Huawei,
which is a major Chinese communication equipment maker,
charging espionage agents, and tightening measures aimed
at preventing technology theft and ensuring competitiveness
in fi elds where there is a risk of technology being diverted
to military uses. As can be seen from the fact that the
provisions of the National Defense Authorization Act for
Fiscal Year 2019 include a prohibition on participation by


China in RIMPAC unless China ceased all land reclamation
activities and removed all weapons from land reclamation
sites, in the South China Sea, and a prohibition on executive
agencies from using or procuring telecommunications
equipment produced by Huawei Technologies company or
other major Chinese telecommunication manufacturers,
the Trump administration’s stance on China has bipartisan
support in Congress, which appears likely to be maintained
going forward. Under the recognition that North Korea’s
actions and policies to pursue nuclear and missile programs
constitutes an extraordinary threat to the United States, it has
maintained sanctions and continues its efforts to pursue the
complete denuclearization of North Korea (see 1-3 of this
Section).
While the United States has also been dealing with
security issues outside of the Indo-Pacifi c region, moves to
withdraw or reduce troops have been seen in some regions
since December 2018. In response to the offensive from
the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant (ISIL) and other
organizations in Iraq and Syria since 2014, the United States,
since August 2014, has led Operation Inherent Resolve (OIR),
a military operation against ISIL that includes airstrikes. In
December 2018, President Trump expressed his intention to
carry out a slow and highly coordinated withdrawal of U.S.
Forces deployed in Syria, but, after the voicing of fear and
opposition both at home and abroad, subsequently hinted
in February 2019 at the possibility that a small force might
remain stationed there.
In August 2017, the United States announced its strategy
on Afghanistan and South Asia which made clear its
continuous involvement with Afghanistan, and in September
2017, it disclosed that reinforcements of over 3,000 U.S.
military personnel would be sent to Afghanistan. However, it
is believed to have shifted to a policy of seeking a direct talk
with the Taliban sometime before July 2018 and in January
2019, it was reported that the United States had reached an
agreement in principle with the Taliban on a draft peace pact


-----

that includes the withdrawal of U.S. Forces.[1]

Furthermore, the United States has been increasing
pressure on Iran from many aspects, stating it is to bring Iran
to the negotiation table to conclude a comprehensive deal that
addresses activities that destabilize the Middle East region,
including the nuclear program.[2] In these circumstances, in
June 2019, the United States revealed that Iran shot down
a U.S. drone, which drove the United States to the brink of
retaliatory strikes in response. In this way, tensions between
the United States and Iran are increasing.[3] The United States
says that, although it does not want a war with Iran, the
United States has been ready to defend its forces and interests
in the region, warning Iran not to mistake U.S. restraint for
weakness. In addition, when commercial vessels, including
one related to Japan, were attacked near the Straits of
Hormuz in May and June 2019, the United States pointed
out that Iran or its proxies conducted the attacks. The United
States proposed efforts by like-minded countries to secure
international waterways in the region, indicating its intension
to develop them.[4]

The United States has positioned anti-Russian deterrence
alongside anti-Chinese deterrence as a priority in its national
defense strategy. In December 2018, immediately after
Russia’s capture of Ukrainian naval vessels in the Kerch
Strait and the detention of their crew members, the United
States conducted Freedom of Navigation Operations in the
vicinity of Peter the Great Gulf, which was the first time
of the operation in those waters since 1987. In light of
Russian actions concerning Ukraine, in order to strengthen
involvement in North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO)
security and deterrence, the investment for the European
Deterrence Initiative[5] has been set at US$5.9 billion in the
FY2020 Department of Defense (DoD) budget request.
On the other hand, in its security policies, the United
States considers that certain allies which are pointed out as
bearing only a small burden of cost and enjoying security


guaranteed by the United States should shoulder their fair
share of responsibility. Under such a perception, the United
States has requested NATO member states to swiftly
meet their commitments to increase their national defense
spending to 2% of Gross Domestic Product (GDP).
Two years have passed since the inauguration of the Trump
administration and attention will focus on how the divided
Congress resulting from the mid-term election—which left
the Republicans holding a majority in the Senate and the
Democrats a majority in the House of Representatives—will
affect U.S. security and defense policies.

1 Perception about Security Environment


The National Security Strategy (NSS)[6] released in December
2017 indicates that changes in a regional balance of power
can have global consequences and threaten U.S. interests. It
mentions the three main sets of challengers against the United
States and its allies and partners, which are the “revisionist
powers” of China and Russia, the “rogue states” of Iran and
North Korea, and transnational threat organizations, including
jihadist terrorist groups. Of these, China and Russia are said
to challenge American power, influence, and interests and
attempt to erode American safety and prosperity, while North
Korea and Iran destabilize regions and threaten the United
States and its allies.
In addition, the National Defense Strategy (NDS)[7]

published in January 2018 points out that the primary
concern in U.S. security is not terrorism but rather long-term
strategic competition with China and Russia. It also mentions
that China and Russia are undermining the free and open

international order constructed by the United States and its
allies, and it is increasingly clear that China and Russia want
to shape a world consistent with their authoritarian model.
Furthermore, regarding the military actions[8] carried out
with the United Kingdom and France after determining


**Chapter**


It has been reported that, after reaching a fresh agreement on a withdrawal on condition that the Taliban does not allow Al Qaeda or ISIL to use Afghanistan’s territory, the United States and
the Taliban broadly agreed that foreign troops, including U.S. Forces, would withdraw from Afghanistan within 18 months. Special Representative for Afghanistan Reconciliation Zalmay
Khalilzad stated in December 2018 that there had been significant progress on vital issues in this regard, while Secretary of State Mike Pompeo tweeted that the United States was serious
about pursuing peace and bringing troops home.

In May 2019, the United States announced that, in order to respond to threats from Iran to the U.S. forces and interests, the United States was additionally deploying an aircraft carrier
strike group, a bomber task force, an amphibious transport dock ship and a Patriot battery to the U.S. Central Command, as well as approximately 1,500 troops comprised of additional
intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance aircraft including unmanned drones, and a fighter aircraft squadron. In addition, in June 2019, the United States announced that it was
sending approximately 1,000 additional troops to the Middle East in response to a request from U.S. Central Command.

President Trump revealed that the United States had been prepared to retaliate against three different sites in Iran in response to Iran’s shooting down of a U.S. drone over international
waters. However, on hearing a report by a General estimating that the number of Iranian deaths would be about 150, the president thought it disproportionate to the shooting down of an
unmanned drone, so 10 minutes before the strike, he stopped it. However, the United States reportedly carried out cyber attacks on Iran, instead.

Remarks by then Acting Defense Secretary Esper at NATO Headquarters (June 2019)

This initiative reassures allies and partners of NATO that the United States is committed to their security and territorial integrity by increasing the presence of the U.S. Forces in Europe,
conducting further bilateral and multilateral training and exercises with NATO allies and other countries, and strengthening the prepositioning of U.S. equipment in Europe. Until recently it
was called the European Reassurance Initiative, but the name was changed to the European Deterrence Initiative in the FY2019 Budget Blueprint.

The NSS comprehensively indicates political, economic, military and diplomatic policies aimed at protecting U.S. for national security interests and achieving goals.

The NDS affords the president and secretary of defense the utmost strategic flexibility, decides the force structure to meet needs, and supports the latest national security strategy.

On April 13 Eastern Standard Time (on April 14 Japan time), the United States together with France and the United Kingdom conducted strikes against three chemical weapons-related
facilities of the Syrian administration. The U.S. DoD announced that it believed that all 105 cruise missiles used hit their targets. Of these, the U.S. Forces fired 30 tomahawk missiles from

that Syria s Assad regime had used chemical weapons in
April 2018, President Trump stated that establishing strong
deterrence against the production, proliferation, and use of
chemical weapons is an important interest for the national
security of the United States.
In consideration of this recognition, the United States
deems as security threats nations and organizations that
attempt to undermine the interests of itself and its allies and
threaten the international order. The Trump administration is
addressing threats posed by China and Russia with particular
emphasis as priority issues and appears to be continuing a
policy of dealing with threats posed by North Korea, Iran,
radical terrorist groups, and production, proliferation, and
use of weapons of mass destruction.

2 Security and National Defense Strategy


The NSS developed by President Trump is rooted in the
America First policy and realism in which power plays a
central role in international politics, and stresses the need
to rethink the policies of the past 20 years that were based
on the assumption that engagement with rivals and their
inclusion in the international community would turn them
into benign actors and trustworthy partners. Moreover, the
NSS sets up a strategic policy to protect four vital interests
in this competitive world: (1) Protect the American people,
the homeland, and the American way of life; (2) Promote
American prosperity; (3) Preserve peace through strength;
and (4) Advance American influence.
Furthermore, in addition to rebuilding the U.S. military
to the strongest armed forces and strengthening capabilities
in many areas including space and cyberspace, the United
States is also striving to leverage the balance of power in the
Indo-Pacific, Europe, and the Middle East. Moreover, while
recognizing that allies and partners are a great strength of the
United States and close cooperation is necessary, the United
States has demanded that its allies and partners demonstrate
the will to confront shared threats and contribute the
capabilities. It is also pointed out that although the United
States is responding to the growing political, economic,
and military competition throughout the world, by ensuring
American military power is second to none and fully
integrating with its allies all instruments of power, the United
States will seek areas of cooperation with competitors from
a position of strength.
The NDS drawn up by Secretary of Defense Mattis (then)
based on the NSS considers the long-term competitions
with China and Russia as the principal priorities of the DoD
because of the magnitude of the threats they pose to U.S.
security and prosperity and the potential for the threats to


increase. Moreover, to expand the competitive space, the
following three lines of effort are raised: (1) Building a more
lethal Joint Force; (2) Strengthening alliances and attracting
new partners; and (3) Reforming the DoD for greater
performance and affordability.
Among these, (1) Building military power prioritizes
preparedness for war and in order to defeat aggression
by a major power and deter opportunistic aggression
elsewhere, it advances building flexible theater postures
and force deployment that have mobility, resilience, and
modernize key capabilities such as nuclear forces, space
and cyberspace, C4ISR (command, control, communication,
computer, intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance),
missile defense, advanced autonomous systems, etc. Further,
although indicating its commitment to deter aggression,
it also demonstrates the stance that dynamic military
force employment, military posture, and operations must
introduce unpredictability to adversary decision-makers.
For 2. Strengthening alliances, the following three matters
are emphasized: i. Uphold a foundation of mutual respect,
responsibility, priorities, and accountability, ii. Expand
regional consultative mechanisms and collaborative
planning, and iii. Deepen interoperability. On the other hand,
there are expectations that allies and partners contribute an
equitable share to mutually beneficial collective security,
including effective investment in modernizing their defense
capabilities.

3 Involvement in the Indo-Pacific Region


The Trump administration has positioned the Indo-Pacific
region as a priority region for the United States and has shown
a stance of placing importance on the region through the
United States’ commitment to the region and strengthening
its presence.
During his November 2017 trip to Asia, in consonance
with Japan’s vision for a free and open Indo-Pacific, President
Trump expressed his intention to emphasize compliance with
principles such as respecting the rule of law and freedom of
navigation, and that he would promote a free and open IndoPacific region, as well as strengthen alliances in the region.
In relation to this, the NSS emphasizes that China seeks
to displace the United States in the Indo-Pacific region and
reorder the region in its favor, as well as having mounted a
rapid military modernization campaign to limit U.S. access to
the region and to provide itself a freer hand there. Moreover,
as part of its Indo-Pacific region strategy, while reinforcing
its commitment to freedom of the seas and the peaceful
resolution of territorial and maritime disputes in accordance
with international law, the United States will seek to increase

partners is a force multiplier to achieve peace, deterrence and
interoperable warfighting capability, the IPSR states that the
United States will reinforce its commitment to established
alliances and partnerships while also expanding and
deepening relationships with new partners. The IPSR also
indicates that the United States will evolve U.S. alliances and
partnerships into a networked security architecture to uphold
the international rules-based order.
In May 2018, regarding China’s maritime expansion, the
U.S. DoD stated that China had deployed anti-ship missiles
and surface-to-air missiles to the features in the Spratly
Islands, and pointed out that the placement of these weapon
system was only military use. As an initial response to China’s
continued militarization of areas in the South China Sea, the
United States disinvited the Chinese navy to the multilateral
Rim of the Pacific Exercise (RIMPAC) in 2018. In a speech
about the United States’ policy towards China in October
2018, Vice President Mike Pence remarked that China’s
aggression had been exposed when a Chinese naval vessel
came within 45 yards of the USS Decatur as it conducted
Freedom of Navigation Operations in the South China Sea,
forcing the U.S. Destroyer to take action to avoid a collision.[9]

He went on to say that, despite such reckless harassment, the
U.S. Navy will continue to fly, sail, and operate wherever
international law allows and U.S. national interests demand,
and that the United States will not be intimidated and will
not stand down.
It is reported that, under the Trump administration,
the U.S. Forces have conducted Freedom of Navigation
Operations[10] within 12 nautical miles of the islands and reefs
in the South China Sea claimed by China on 13 occasions

up to May 2019, and have made ten bomber flights over the
South China Sea.
Based on such a perception of China and regional strategy,
it can be considered that the United States is advancing efforts
rooted in the concept of free and open Indo-Pacific region.
In addition, as part of its activities around strengthening its
presence in the Indo-Pacific region, in January 2017, the U.S.
Forces deployed Marine Corps specification F-35B fighters
to MCAS Iwakuni. In October 2017, 12 Air Force specified
F-35A fighters were deployed at Kadena Air Force Base for
the first time ever in the Asia-Pacific region. Also, in January
2018, nuclear-capable B-2 bombers and B-52 bombers were

a research institute on October 4, 2018 [courtesy of the White House]

quadrilateral cooperation with Japan, Australia, and India
and develop a strong defense networks with its allies and
partners. In the same way, the NDS points out that China
is leveraging military modernization, influence operations,
and predatory economics to coerce neighboring countries
to reorder the Indo-Pacific region to their advantage and
is seeking regional hegemony. It emphasizes that a free
and open Indo-Pacific provides prosperity and security,
and that the United States will strengthen its alliances and
partnerships in the Indo-Pacific to a networked security
architecture capable of deterring aggression, maintaining
stability, and ensuring free access to common domains.
Under this strategic policy, Secretary of State Mike Pompeo
announced at the August 2018 Association of Southeast
Asian Nations (ASEAN) Regional Forum (ARF) that the
United States intends to provide nearly US$300 million in
security assistance to improve security relationships across
the Indo-Pacific region.
Meanwhile, the Indo-Pacific Strategy Report (IPSR) of
the U.S. DoD, which was released in June 2019, fleshes out
this policy in accordance with the characteristics of the IndoPacific region while retaining the strategic directions of the
NSS and the NDS. Noting first of all that it is necessary to
establish a force that is prepared to win any conflict from its
onset in order to achieve peace through strength, the IPSR
states that the United States will ensure that combat-credible
forces are forward-postured in the Indo-Pacific region and
will prioritize investments that ensure lethality against highend adversaries. Next, arguing that the network of allies and


**Chapter**


9 Noting China’s military expansion, attempts to push the United States from the western Pacific Ocean, routine patrol around the Senkaku Islands, and militarization in the South China Sea,
Vice President Mike Pence stated that China was engaged in forced technology transfer and intellectual property theft, and that its security agencies have masterminded the wholesale
theft of technology including military technology. Citing examples of China’s use of debt diplomacy to expand its influence, he mentioned the possibility that a port in Sri Lanka for which
China provided investment might become a Chinese forward naval military base as Sri Lanka’s could not afford its payment. Vice President Pence also highlighted the fact that China had
convinced three Latin American nations to sever ties with Taiwan and recognize the Chinese government, and stated that the United States condemns these actions, which he said threaten
the stability of the Taiwan Strait. He made clear that, even as it hopes for improved relations with China, the United States will continue to stand strong for its security and economy, and
will continue to assert U.S. interests across the Indo-Pacific.

10 It is regarded that the Trump administration implemented the Freedom of Navigation Operations in May, July, August, and October 2017; January, March, May, September, and November
2018; January, February and May (twice) 2019.

deployed to Guam, and in place of the amphibious assault
ship USS Bonhomme Richard, the amphibious assault ship
USS Wasp that is capable of carrying F-35B fighters arrived
in Sasebo.[11] Furthermore, in March 2018 the aircraft carrier
USS Carl Vinson made the first port call by a U.S. aircraft
carrier in over 40 years in Vietnam. In addition, the United
States reportedly deployed two naval vessels on passages
through the Taiwan Strait in July, October, and November
2018, and January, February, March, April and May 2019.
At the same time, under the policy to continue sustaining
maximum pressure on North Korea, which was continuing
its nuclear and ballistic missile development, the Trump
administration was exhibiting its recognition that a military
option plays an important role in backing up diplomatic
efforts, and also was clearly showing its readiness to respond
with overwhelming power in retaliation to any attack by
North Korea.
In an historic first, a U.S.-North Korea Summit Meeting
took place in June 2018. Both leaders clearly indicated
willingness for jointly making efforts to build a lasting and
stable peace regime on the Korean Peninsula, and based on
the reaffirmed commitment expressed by Chairman Kim
toward complete denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula,
both leaders confirmed that follow-on negotiations would
continue. Responding to this discussion, the U.S. DoD
suspended the U.S.-Republic of Korea (ROK) command
and control exercise Ulchi-Freedom Guardian scheduled
for August and two Korean Marine Exchange Program[12]

training exercises. It subsequently suspended the scheduled
Vigilant Ace U.S.-ROK bilateral annual flying exercise, and
then decided in March 2019 to conclude the Key Resolve

and Foal Eagle series of exercises usually held by the United
States and South Korea every spring. Then Acting Secretary
of Defense Patrick Shanahan expressed a willingness to
maintain U.S. Forces in South Korea, stating that close
coordination between the military activities of the United
States and South Korea will continue to support diplomatic
efforts and that the two countries were committed to ensuring
the continued combined defense posture of U.S.-ROK
combined forces and maintaining firm military readiness.
The second U.S.-North Korea Summit Meeting was held
in February 2019, and an agreement between the U.S. and
North Korea could not be reached. Amid a gap between the


two sides over denuclearization, North Korea sought the
lifting of all sanctions, but President Trump said he could
not give up all of the sanctions, and indicated his intention to
maintain them.
In addition, when President Trump visited the ROK in June
2019, he met the leader of North Korea at Panmunjom, and
they agreed to proceed with dialogue at the working level.
(See Section 3-1-5 (1) Relations with the United States)

4 Innovation Initiatives in the National Defense Field


Although the Trump administration has stopped using the
name Third Offset Strategy,[13] which was touted by the Obama
administration, DoD innovation initiatives are positioned as
one of the top priorities. In fact, the NSS outlines a policy
that the United States must harness innovative technologies
that are being developed outside of the traditional defense
industrial base. The NDS also states that the DoD needs
innovation to surpass revisionist powers, and calls for
extensive investment in military application of autonomy,
artificial intelligence, and machine learning, including rapid
application of commercial breakthroughs, to gain competitive
military advantages.
In February 2018, the DoD established the new post of
Under Secretary of Defense for Research and Engineering,
in charge of furthering the nation’s military superiority
through advanced technology and innovation, and decisionmaking on game-changing investment. Giving testimony
before Congress about innovation in April 2018 after being
appointed to this post, Under Secretary of Defense Michael
Griffin demonstrated the recognition that, while U.S. Forces
are still the most technologically advanced in the world,
they are losing their supremacy and need to re-establish
and maintain that technological advantage. The DoD, he
said, continues to push the envelope with research into new
technologies such as autonomous and unmanned systems,
artificial intelligence, machine learning, biotechnology,
space technology, microelectronics and cyber, both offense
and defense. In June 2018, the department established the
Joint Artificial Intelligence Center to accelerate the delivery
of AI-enabled capabilities and the DoD Artificial Intelligence
(AI) Strategy published in February 2019 positions JAIC at
the focal point of the department’s AI strategy.

11 In April 2019, the U.S. Navy announced the deployment in Sasebo of USS America, an amphibious assault ship which can operate F-35B as a ship-borne aircraft, and USS New Orleans, an
amphibious transport dock ship. It was also announced that USS Wasp, an amphibious assault ship deployed in Sasebo, and USS Stethem, a destroyer deployed in Yokosuka, would return
to the U.S. mainland for maintenance and refurbishment, respectively.

12 The Korean Marine Exchange Program (KMEP) is an annually-held joint exercise between the U.S. Marine Corps stationed in Okinawa and the ROK Marine Corps. 19 exercises were
planned under the KMEP in 2018, and 11 exercises had been carried out as of June 22, 2018.

13 The United States’ Third Offset Strategy is based on the concept of offsetting the capacity of the adversary by acquiring asymmetrical means that differ from the capacity of the adversary.
There were two previous offset strategies as follows: (1) the nuclear deterrent of the 1950s; and (2) precision-guided missiles and stealth aircraft technologies of the 1970s. In November
2014, Secretary of Defense Hagel (then) announced the Defense Innovation Initiative (DII) that aimed to achieve military superiority through innovation, and stated the expectation that this

5 Nuclear and Missile Defense Policy


The Nuclear Posture Review (NPR) released in February
2018 stated that, although the United States had reduced
the role and number of nuclear weapons based on the
aspiration that if the United States took the lead in reducing
nuclear arms, other states would follow, the global threat
conditions have worsened markedly since the most recent
NPR[14] released in 2010 and there now exist unprecedented
threats and uncertainty, as China and Russia have expanded
their nuclear forces and North Korea continues its pursuit
of nuclear weapons and missile capabilities. Given these
circumstances, the following were raised as the roles of U.S.
nuclear forces: (1) Deterrence of nuclear and nonnuclear
attacks; (2) Assurance of allies and partners; (3) Achievement
of U.S. objectives if deterrence fails; and (4) Capacity to
hedge against an uncertain future.
Also, while the United States would only consider the
employment of nuclear weapons in extreme circumstances to
defend the vital interests of the United States, its allies, and
partners, the NPR clearly states that extreme circumstances
could include significant non-nuclear strategic attacks
against the United States and its allies, and a “no first use”
policy is not justified today. It also indicates that the United
States remains the policy to retain some ambiguity regarding
the precise circumstances that might lead to a U.S. nuclear
response. Furthermore, it also revealed that the United
States would apply a tailored approach to deter across a
spectrum of adversaries, threats and contexts, and in addition
to that, it would ensure effective deterrence by enhancing
the flexibility and range of its nuclear capabilities through
nuclear modernization and the development and deployment
of new capabilities. Specifically, in addition to sustaining
and replacing the nuclear triad,[15] as new capabilities, in the
near-term, the United States would modify a small number
of existing SLBM warheads to provide a low-yield option,[16]
and in the longer term, pursue a modern nuclear-armed
sea-launched cruise missile (SLCM), leveraging existing
technologies, as well as incorporate nuclear capability onto the

forward-deployable, nuclear-capable F-35 as a replacement
for the current aging dual-capable aircraft (DCA). Also,
the United States has shown its commitment to extended
deterrence for its allies and, if necessary, maintaining the
forward-deployed capability with DCA and nuclear weapons
in regions outside Europe, including Northeast Asia.
In October 2018, President Trump expressed his intention
to withdraw from the Intermediate-Range Nuclear Forces
(INF) Treaty with Russia, due to Russia’s material breach,
and in February 2019, the United States provided Russia with
formal notice that the United States would withdraw from
the treaty. The United States also expressed that if Russia
does not return to full and verifiable compliance with the
treaty in six months, the treaty would terminate.[17] On August
2, 2019, Secretary of State Pompeo announced that the U.S.
withdrawal pursuant to Article XV of the treaty took effect
that day because Russia failed to return to full and verified
compliance. On the same day, Secretary of Defense Esper
announced that the DoD will fully pursue the development

of intermediate-range, conventional, ground-launched cruise
and ballistic missile systems whose test launches, production
and possession have been restricted by the treaty. On August
18, 2019, The United States conducted a flight test of a
conventionally-configured ground-launched cruise missile
with a range of more than 500 km (See Section 4-3-1).[18]
President Trump has mentioned the need for arms control
involving China, which has beefed up medium-range missile


**Chapter**


14 The NPR released in 2010 called for a world without nuclear weapons, with goals that included reducing the role of the U.S.’s nuclear weapons and maintaining strategic deterrence and
stability at reduced nuclear force levels.

15 The nuclear triad consists of Minuteman III ICBM, Ballistic Missile Submarines (SSBN) armed with Trident II D5 SLBM, and strategic bombers B-52 and B-2.
16 The Department of Energy’s National Nuclear Security Administration announced in February 2019 that it had completed production of the first W76-2 low-yield nuclear warheads to be
carried by SLBMs. The initial operational capability of the warheads is due to be achieved and delivered to the Navy by the end of fiscal 2019.

17 In June 2019, then Acting U.S. Secretary of Defense Mark Esper remarked that should Russia refuse to return to compliance with the INF Treaty by August 2, 2019, the Treaty will cease to
exist. Since the collapse of the Soviet Union in 1991, the countries covered by the treaty have increased: the countries covered at present are the United States, Russia, Belarus,
Kazakhstan, Turkmenistan, Ukraine and Uzbekistan. Under Article 15 of the INF Treaty, notification of withdrawal must be made to all signatory countries of the treaty.

18 On August 2, 2019, Secretary of Defense Esper stated that the United States commenced Treaty-compliant research and development efforts focused on mobile, conventional, groundlaunched cruise and ballistic missile systems beginning in 2017, and that those programs were in the early stages. Meanwhile, it was reported in March 2019 that the DoD had announced
that it would commence fabrication activities on components to support developmental testing of conventional, ground-launched missiles, and test launches of conventional cruise missiles
with a range of about 1,000 km and conventional ballistic missiles with a range of 3,000 to 4,000 km—both of which were restricted under the INF Treaty— are reportedly planned for
August and November 2019, respectively. In addition, in August, Secretary of Defense Esper remarked that it was going to take a few years to actually have newly developed groundl h d i d b lli ti i il t b bl t d l

capabilities outside the scope of the INF Treaty.
At the same time, the Missile Defense Review (MDR)[19]
published in January 2019 noted that North Korea continues
to pose an extraordinary threat to the United States and,
with its nuclear missiles, has the ability to threaten the
U.S. homeland, as well as U.S. territories, U.S. Forces, and
allies in the Pacific Ocean. It also pointed out that Russia
and China are developing advanced cruise missiles and
hypersonic missiles that challenge existing missile defense
systems. The MDR sets out three principles governing U.S.
missile defense: (1) homeland missile defense will stay
ahead of rogue states’ missile threats; (2) missile defense
will defend U.S. Forces deployed abroad and support the
security of allies and partners; and (3) the United States will
pursue new concepts and technologies. It cited the elements
of missile defense strategy as (1) comprehensive missile
defense capabilities; (2) flexibility and adaptability; (3)
tighter offense-defense integration and interoperability; and
(4) importance of space. The MDR then presented a policy
of adopting a balanced and integrated approach based on a
combination of (1) deterrence; (2) active and passive missile
defenses; and (3) attack operations.
Under this policy, the United States plans to expand
investment in expanding and modernizing U.S. homeland
missile defense capabilities by such means as deploying an
additional 20 ground-based interceptors by 2023, improving
and deploying radar systems, and pursuing efforts to counter
intercontinental ballistic missiles (ICBM) using SM-3 Block
IIA. For regional defense, on the other hand, the United States
will procure additional interceptor missiles for the Terminal
High Altitude Area Defense (THAAD), Aegis, and Patriot
systems, as well as increasing the number of Aegis BMDcapable ships[20], and equipping Aegis Ashore sites with the
SM-3 Block IIA. Regarding the pursuit of new technologies,
the MDR sets out a policy of developing the Multi-Object Kill
Vehicle[21] (MOKV) to improve the ability to engage ICBM
warheads and decoys, as well as undertaking research and
development focused on (1) directed-energy weapons; (2)
space-based interceptor systems; and (3) interceptor missiles


with which F-35 fighters can be equipped, to enable spacebased sensors to be deployed and interception to be carried
out in the boost phase, with a view to countering advanced
threats, including hypersonic glide vehicles (HGVs) and
hypersonic cruise missiles. As far as collaboration with allies
and partners is concerned, the MDR indicates a willingness
to focus on deepening interoperability, expanding burden
sharing, and encouraging investment by allies in missile
defense capabilities that are interoperable with those of the
United States.

6 FY2020 Budget


As the budget deficit of the U.S. Government is deepening
in recent years, the Budget Control Act enacted in August
2011 stipulated a significant cut in government spending
by FY2021.[22] Also, in March 2013, the sequestration of
government spending including defense expenditure was
started based on the provisions of the Budget Control Act.
However, after this, sequestration was eased for the budgets
from FY2014-FY2017 due to the bipartisan acts passed
twice.[23] Furthermore, amid the Trump administration’s
policy to end the sequestration of defense spending in order
to rebuild the U.S. military, the Bipartisan Budget Act was
passed in February 2018, and a defense budget framework
was approved that drastically raised the limit set by the
sequestration for FY2018 and 2019.[24]

In these circumstances, the defense budget request in the
FY2020 Budget Blueprint submitted to Congress in March
2019 allocated US$718.3 billion for the base budget,[25]
representing about a 4.9% increase over the previous year.[26]

In this, the DoD has positioned the purpose of its main budget
as deterring or defeating great power aggression through (1)
investment in the space and cyber warfighting domains; (2)
modernization of capabilities in the aerial, marine, and land
warfighting domains; (3) more rapid innovation; and (4)
building on readiness gains. In addition, as well as requesting
the largest research and development budget in 70 years and
the largest ship building budget in 20 years, the department


**Chapter**


19 The Ballistic Missile Defense Review (BMDR) that President Trump had directed to be formulated alongside the NPR was drawn up as the Missile Defense Review (MDR), in light of the
growing threat from not only ballistic missiles, but also advanced cruise missiles and hypersonic glide vehicles, among others.

20 The MDR states that the number of BMD-capable Aegis ships will be increased from 38 to 60 by 2023.
21 Together with increasing object identification capability, the MOKV development program improves interceptor missile performance by developing the capability to destroy multiple objects
through enabling one interceptor missile to load multiple kill vehicles.

22 In January 2012, the DoD announced that the specific national defense annual expenditure reduction based on the enacted act would amount to roughly US$487 billion over the 10 year
period between FY2012 and FY2021 (roughly US$259 billion during the five year period between FY2013 and FY2017).

23 Through the passing of the 2013 Non-Partisan Budget Act, the national defense budget limit was raised by US$22 billion and US$9 billion in FY2014 and FY2015 respectively. Through the
passing of the 2015 Non-Partisan Budget Act, the national defense budget limit was raised to US$25 billion and US$15 billion in FY2016 and FY2017 respectively.

24 Through the passing of the 2018 Non-Partisan Budget Act, the national defense budget limit was raised to US$80 billion and US$85 billion in FY2018 and FY2019 respectively.
25 The breakdown is as follows: a base budget of approximately US$544.5 billion, approximately US$97.9 billion for overseas contingency operations for the base budget, approximately
US$66.7 billion for overseas contingency operations, and approximately US$9.2 billion for emergencies. This represents an increase of about US$33.3 billion from the FY2019 enacted
budget level.

26 The total sum of the FY2020 national defense budget request was roughly US$750 billion, including defense-related budget requests from other departments of roughly US$31.7 billion (such

was reestablished in August 2018 to take responsibility for
the U.S. East Coast and North Atlantic Ocean.
The U.S. air forces have roughly 3,520 combat aircraft

carrier-based aircraft deployed at sea, part of the tactical air
force is forward-deployed in Germany, the United Kingdom,
Japan, and the ROK.
In regard to strategic offensive weapons including
nuclear force, the United States under the former Obama
administration proceeded with its reduction based on a new
Strategic Arms Reduction Treaty that came into force in
February 2011. In March 2019, it announced that its deployed
strategic warheads[27] stood at 1,365, while its deployed
delivery platforms stood at 656.[28] The United States is

The operation of the U.S. Forces is not controlled by the
individual branches of the broader armed forces, rather it
is operated under the command of the Unified Combatant
Commands, composed of forces from multiple branches of
the armed forces. The Unified Combatant Commands consist
of four commands with functional responsibilities and six
commands with regional responsibilities.
The U.S. ground forces have about 460,000 Army soldiers
and about 190,000 Marines, which are forward-deployed
in Germany, the ROK, and Japan, among other countries.
Along with a shift from the Obama administration’s policy
reducing soldiers to a policy of increasing them, in order to
deter enemies and achieve battle victories when necessary,
the Army has been making efforts to maintain the world’s
leading ground force capability through necessary investment
in ensuring readiness. The Marine Corps aims to acquire
forces capable of responding to any threat as a “middleweight
force,” bridging the seam between smaller special operations
forces and larger heavy conventional forces.
The U.S. maritime forces have about 970 vessels


27 Warheads that have been equipped in deployed ICBMs and Submarine-Launched Ballistic Missiles (SLBMs) and nuclear warheads equipped in heavy bombers (a deployed heavy bomber is
counted as one nuclear warhead).

to reduce reliance on nuclear weapons.[29]

Moreover, in addressing the increasing threats in
cyberspace, the U.S. Cyber Command was founded in order to
oversee operations in cyberspace. The U.S. Cyber Command
achieved Initial Operational Capability (IOC) in May 2010
and commended full capability in November in the same
year. Furthermore, in May 2018, the Cyber Command, which
was previously a subunified command under U.S. Strategic
Command, was elevated to a unified combatant command.
Furthermore, in June 2018, President Trump instructed
the DoD to immediately start the necessary processes to
establish the Space Force as the sixth branch of the Armed
Forces, and subsequently directed the department to establish
a U.S. Space Command as a unified combatant command
that December (See Chapter 3, Section 2-2). In February
2019, in response to a directive signed by President Trump
that month, the DoD forwarded to Congress a legislative
proposal to create the Space Force within the Department of
the Air Force.

The U.S. Pacific Fleet consists of the 7th Fleet, which is
responsible for the Western Pacific and the Indian Ocean, and
the 3rd Fleet, responsible for the East Pacific and Bering Sea.
The U.S. Pacific Fleet in total controls about 200 vessels. The
7th Fleet mainly consists of a carrier strike group with main
stationing locations in Japan and Guam. Their mission is to
defend territorial lands, people, sea lines of communication,
and the critical national interests of the United States and
its allies. An aircraft carrier, amphibious ships, and Aegis
cruisers and destroyers among others are assigned to the 7th
Fleet.
The U.S. Marine Corps Forces Pacific deploys one
Marine Expeditionary Force each in the U.S. mainland and
Japan. Of this force, about 21,000 personnel are in the 3rd
Marine Division and the 1st Marine Aircraft Wing, which are
equipped with F/A-18 fighters and other aircraft, in Japan. In
addition, maritime pre-positioning ships loaded with heavy
equipment and others are deployed in the Western Pacific.[31]

The U.S. Pacific Air Force has three air forces, of which
three air wings (equipped with F-16 fighters and C-130
transport aircraft) are deployed to the 5th Air Force stationed
in Japan and two air wings (equipped with F-16 fighters) to
the 7th Air Force stationed in the ROK.

2 Current Military Posture in the Asia-Pacific Region


The United States, a Pacific nation, continues to play an
important role in ensuring the peace and stability of the
Asia-Pacific region by placing the Indo-Pacific Command, a
combatant command integrating the Army, Navy, Air Force
and Marine Corps in the region. The Indo-Pacific Command
is a geographic combatant command which is responsible
for the largest geographical area, and its subordinate unified
commands include U.S. Forces Japan and U.S. Forces Korea.
The Indo-Pacific Command consists of the U.S. Army
Pacific, U.S. Pacific Fleet, U.S. Marine Corps Forces Pacific,
and U.S. Pacific Air Forces, which are all headquartered in
Hawaii.
The Army Pacific’s subordinate commands include the
25th Infantry Division in Hawaii, the 8th U.S. Army in the
ROK, which is the Army component of the U.S. Forces in
the ROK, and the U.S. Army Alaska. Additionally, the Army
Pacific assigns approximately 2,700 personnel to commands

high accuracy.

**Section**
**2** **China**


**1** **General Situation**


China, the world’s most populous country, has a vast landmass
surrounded by a long borderline shared with 14 countries as
well as a long coastline. China is also a nation with various
races, religions, and languages. China, with a long history,
has been shaping and maintaining a distinct culture and
civilization. China’s pride in its unique history and semicolonial experience in and after the 19th century are driving
its desire for a strong nation and fueling its nationalism.
In recent years, China has increased its presence in
the international community. For example, China takes a
proactive stance towards efforts in nontraditional security
areas, making personnel and financial contributions to
United Nations (UN) Peacekeeping Operations (PKO) and
continuously sending its ships for counter-piracy activities
off the coast of Somalia and in the Gulf of Aden. Furthermore,
China has participated proactively in humanitarian assistance
and disaster relief activities. These activities have been
highly appreciated by the international community. There
continues to be high expectations for China to recognize its
responsibility in the international community, accept and
comply with international norms, and play an active role in a
more cooperative manner on regional and global issues.
China faces various problems domestically including
human rights issues. Among the problems emerging are
the spread of bribery and corruption among the central and
local leadership of the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) and
issues triggered by China’s rapid economic growth, such
as regional disparities between urban and rural areas, and
between coastal and inland regions, as well as disparities
within cities and environmental pollution. More recently,
the pace of China’s economic growth has slowed[1] and the
country is also expected to face issues associated with the
rapid aging of the population, including problems related
to pensions and other aspects of the social security system.
The range of factors potentially destabilizing to government
administration has thus been expanding and becoming
increasingly diverse. Amid these circumstances, the Chinese
Government has been tightening its control over society, but
it has been suggested that controlling activities of the masses
is becoming increasingly difficult with advances in the
Internet and other areas of information and communications
technology (ICT). However, others have noted that China is


leveraging the recent rapid developments in ICT as a means of
social control. Additionally, ethnic minorities in China have
been staging protests and carrying out campaigns in pursuit
of separation and independence in the Tibet Autonomous
Region, the Xinjiang Uyghur Autonomous Region, and
elsewhere. Since 2014, China enacted laws that covers not
only security from external threats, but also includes culture
and society as a part of security. Those laws include the
Anti-Spy Law in November 2014, a new National Security
Law in July 2015, an Anti-Terrorism Law in January 2016 to
strengthen state control, a strengthened Law on Management
of Domestic Activities of Overseas Non-governmental
Organizations in January 2017, and the National Intelligence
Law in June 2017 to strengthen domestic espionage
prevention mechanisms under its “holistic view of national
security.”
The “anti-corruption” movement following the launch of
the Xi Jinping leadership has made inroads under the policy
of cracking down on both “tigers” and “flies,” the purpose
of which is considered as prosecuting both dominant figures
and junior officials, with severe charges of “corruption”
on people including current and past prominent leaders of
the Party and military. In his remarks at the 19th National
Congress of the CCP in October 2017, General Secretary
Xi spoke about “strict governance over the Party,” stating
that “corruption is the greatest threat our Party faces,” which
suggests that he will continue to crack down on corruption
within the Party and the military.

of China’s “Message to Compatriots in Taiwan” (January 2019) [EPA/Jiji]

According to an announcement by the National Bureau of Statistics of China, the growth rate of the GDP for the full year of 2018 was 6.6% compared to the previous year. The figure

Through these developments, the Party has demonstrated
a growing willingness in recent years to further bolster the
power base of General Secretary Xi in the CCP. For example,
it was decided at the 19th National Congress to incorporate the
“thoughts,” namely the political philosophy, under the name
of General Secretary Xi Jinping into the Party constitution
as a guideline. This was the first time since President Mao
Zedong that a leader had their name in a guideline before

**2** **Military Affairs**

1 General Situation


For more than 30 years, China has sustained high-level growth
of its defense budget without transparency, engaging in
broad, rapid improvement of its military power in qualitative
and quantitative terms with focus on nuclear, missile, naval
and air forces. In doing so, it has attached importance to
strengthening its operational capabilities in order to steadily
acquire information superiority as a means of both enhancing
operational capabilities throughout the Chinese military and
gaining asymmetrical capabilities to effectively impede
enemies with overall military superiority from exerting
their strength. Specifically, China has been increasingly
emphasizing endeavors to achieve dominance in new
domains. It has been rapidly expanding its capabilities in the
cyber domain, enabling it to disrupt enemy communications
networks, and in the field of electromagnetic spectrum,
which offers the potential to render enemy radar and other
equipment ineffective, thereby hampering their ability to
exercise their military might. In addition, it continues to
build capacity in the space field, which will make it possible
to restrict enemies’ use of space. Bolstering these capabilities
will reinforce China’s “Anti-Access/Area-Denial (A2/AD)”
capabilities and lead to the establishment of operational
capabilities further afield. China is also prioritizing efforts
to increase joint operational capabilities through military
reforms. Additionally, while implementing a policy of civilmilitary fusion across the board, with the aim of promoting
two-way links between military and civilian resources in
technology development and various other fields, China is
striving to develop and acquire cutting-edge technologies
that can be used for military purposes.
Along with these efforts to reinforce its operational
capabilities, China is engaging in unilateral and coercive


retirement. Moreover, at the first plenary session of the 13th
National People’s Congress held in March 2018, a resolution
was adopted to revise the constitution and abolish term
limits for China’s presidents, which indicates that Xi Jinping
is further consolidating power as president. Impacts on the
military of these actions and future relevant developments
are to be watched for.

attempts to change the status quo based on its own assertions
incompatible with the existing international order,[2] and
has been expanding and intensifying its military activities
in maritime and aerial domains, notably in the East China
Sea. China, particularly regarding maritime issues where its
interests conflict with others’, continues to act in an assertive
manner, which includes dangerous acts that could cause
unintended consequences. Additionally, China continues to
demonstrate its willingness to realize its unilateral assertions
without making any compromises, steadily moving forward
with efforts to change the status quo by coercion and to
create a fait accompli.
The Chinese military leadership has emphasized to
continue to improve the Chinese military’s operational
capabilities, exhibiting the results of its activities such as the
“struggle” against the Senkaku Islands, which is an inherent
territory of Japan, the establishment of the “East China Sea
Air Defense Identification Zone (ADIZ),” and its Navy and
Air Force’s “regular patrols.”[3] Although it is not necessarily
clear what activities these examples indicate specifically,
there is a high probability that it is not only planning to make
such activities routine, but also further expand and intensify
them both qualitatively and quantitatively, given that the
Chinese military is rapidly expanding and intensifying
activities including in the areas surrounding Japan, such
as the East China Sea, Pacific Ocean and Sea of Japan.
Meanwhile, in recent years, China has shown interest in
taking steps to avoid and prevent unexpected situations at
sea areas and airspace.
China has been observed to be making steady, rapid
progress with the military reforms in which it has been
engaged since late December 2015 as part of its military
modernization efforts to strengthen practical operational
capabilities. In conjunction with this, it has been working
to accomplish law-based governance over the military and


**Chapter**


For example, regarding the so-called “nine-dash line” asserted by China in the South China Sea, “historic rights” claimed by China were rejected by the Philippines-China arbitration (July
2016). Also, in recent years, some point out that China is drawing a basal line in the South China Sea that does not go in accordance with the United Nations Convention on the Law of the
Sea (UNCLOS) by using its own interpretations of the treaty and other laws.

improve joint operational capabilities through practical
training and human resource development. The policy stated
at the 19th National Congress in October 2017 to speed up
by 15 years the achievement of the third stage of the “threestage development strategy” declared in the past, can be
considered a decision based on development exceeding
China’s own assumptions on the pace of the modernization
of the military. It is possible that military modernization
efforts to strengthen the practical operational capabilities of
the military will be further accelerated, considering General
Secretary Xi Jinping’s strengthening of his power foundation
within the and further strengthening of his authority as the
head of the Central Military Commission of the CCP.
The regional and international communities, including
Japan, therefore have strong security concerns about the
trends including aforementioned rapid strengthening of
operational capabilities by China and its expansion and
intensification of activities in areas surrounding Japan,
coupled with its defense policy and lack of transparency in
its military affairs. Accordingly, it is necessary to pay close
attention to the issues.

2 Defense Policies


China regards that the buildup of strong defense capabilities
and powerful military forces constitutes a strategic mission
to modernize the state, and that it ensures the security of
the state under “peaceful development.” China considers
the main goal and mission of national defense policies as:
to adapt to the new changes in security environment; to
accomplish the strategic guideline of active defense[4] to realize

the CCP’s goal of building a strong military; to accelerate the
modernization of national defense and the military forces; to
firmly protect its national sovereignty, security, and interests
as a result of development; and to provide strong assurances
for realizing the “Chinese dream” of the great revival of
the peoples of China. China contends that these defense
policies are defensive in nature.[5] Furthermore, China seems


to emphasize not only physical means but also non-physical
means in military affairs and warfare. It regards the concept
of “Three Warfares” — “Media Warfare,” “Psychological
Warfare,” and “Legal Warfare” — as part of the political
work of the military. In addition, China has set forth a policy
of close coordination of military struggle with political,
diplomatic, economic, cultural, and legal endeavors.
China has employed a policy to ensure to establish
the “system of modern military power with Chinese
characteristics,” aiming at informatizing the military based
on its military strategy to follow the development trend of
the military all over the world observed in the Gulf War, the
Kosovo War, the Iraq War and so on, and to win informatized
local wars. Dealing with a Taiwan contingency is believed to
be a top priority in China’s efforts to strengthen the military
forces; more specifically, improving its capabilities to deter
the independence of Taiwan and foreign military support
for it. Furthermore, in recent years, China has been steadily
enhancing operational capabilities in more distant waters to
protect its expanding overseas interests.
As for future indicators of the modernization of the
military, in his remarks to the 19th National Congress in
October 2017, General Secretary Xi Jinping proclaimed the
goals of seeing that mechanization is basically achieved, IT
application has come a long way and strategic capabilities
have seen a big improvement by the year 2020, that by 2035
the modernization of its national defense and its forces is
basically completed, and that by the mid-21st century the
people’s armed forces have been fully transformed into
world-class forces. These goals are said to be ahead of the
target of the third stage of the “Three Stage Development

**KEY WORD**


Three Warfares

China amended the Regulations of the PLA on the Political Work in December
2003 to add Media, Psychological, and Legal Warfares to the PLA’s mission.
They are collectively referred to as the “Three Warfares.” U.S. DoD explains
these warfares as follows: (1) Media Warfare is aiming at influencing
domestic and international public opinion to build public and international
support for China’s military actions and to dissuade an adversary from
pursuing policies perceived to be adverse to China’s interests; (2)
Psychological Warfare seeks to undermine an enemy’s ability to conduct
combat operations through psychological operations aimed at deterring,
shocking, and demoralizing enemy military and supporting civilian personnel;
and (3) Legal Warfare uses international and domestic laws to gain
international support and manage possible repercussions of China’s military
actions.


**Chapter**


**KEY WORD**


Central Military Commission (CMC)

The guidance and command institution of the PLA. Formally, there are two
CMCs—one for the CCP and another for the state. However, both
commissions basically consist of the same membership, and both are
essentially regarded as institutions for the CCP to command the military
forces.


The strategic concept of active defense is seen as the essence of the CCP’s military strategic concept. It upholds the principles of defense, self-defense, and “post-emptive strike” (suppress
the adversary after it attacks), and maintains that “We will not attack unless we are attacked, but we will surely counterattack if attacked.”

Strategy, namely the basic modernization of the national
defense and the forces by the middle of the 21st century, and
it is expected that further acceleration of development of
operational capabilities will be seen as China’s power grows.

3 Transparency Concerning Defense Policy and Military
Capability


China has neither set out a clear and specific future vision of
its military strengthening, nor ensured adequate transparency
of its decision-making process in relation to military and
security affairs. Moreover, China has not disclosed specific
information such as possession of weapons, procurement
goals and past procurements, organization and locations
of major units, records of main military operations and
exercises, and a detailed breakdown of its national defense
budget.[6]

China had released defense white papers including
“China’s National Defense” nearly every two years since
1998. China released white paper titled “China’s Military
Strategy” in May 2015, but no more until July 2019, when
it released a defense white paper titled “China’s National
Defense in the New Era,” for the first time in approximately
4 years. In China’s defense white papers released in 2013
and 2015, the contents included limited topics and made no
reference to national defense spending that was described
in previous white papers. The overall description also
decreased. Although the paper published in 2019 resumed
referring to national defense spending, China has not yet
achieved the levels of transparency expected of a responsible
nation in the international community.
Incidents have been occurring that incite concerns over
China’s military decision-making and actions.[7] For example,
details have yet to be disclosed regarding the causes of the
Chinese nuclear-powered submarine’s submerged navigation
in Japan’s territorial waters in November 2004 although it
constitutes a breach of international law. The submerged
transit of a Chinese Navy submarine through Japan’s
contiguous zone around the Senkaku Islands was confirmed
in January 2018, but China did not acknowledge this.[8] In
recent years, amid the significant changes in the environment
surrounding the military, including advances in specialization


of the military and diversification of missions associated
with strengthening of operational capabilities, some see
that relations between the CCP leadership and the People’s
Liberation Army (PLA) have become increasingly complex.
Others opine that the military’s influential power on foreign
policy decisions has been changing. Attention is to be paid to
such situations also in terms of crisis management.
Explanations that stoke concerns about Chinese military
decision-making and actions are also evident in comments
about the South China Sea,[9] where China is seeking to
unilaterally change the status quo and to create a fait accompli.
At the press conference after the U.S.-China Summit Meeting
in September 2015, President Xi Jinping stated, “China does
not have any intention to pursue militarization” in the South
China Sea, but in February the following year, Foreign
Minister Wang Yi described the facilities in the South China
Sea as “necessary self-defense facilities” that China was
developing in accordance with international law. In 2017,
reports in official media asserted that China had rationally
expanded the area of its islands and reefs in the South China
Sea, to “strengthen the necessary military defense.”
At the same time, China engages in a number of
dialogues with the defense authorities of foreign countries.

**10 Furthermore, a spokesperson for the Chinese Ministry of**
National Defense has held a press conference every month
since April 2011 and spokesperson posts were established at
such departments as the PLA Navy, PLA Air Force (PLAAF),
and then-PLA Second Artillery Corps in November 2013.
While China’s release of defense white papers and dialogue
with the defense authorities of other countries help to
increase transparency about defense policy and military

capability, such actions are also regarded as moves to bolster
the country’s media warfare.
China’s influence in the international community has risen
politically, economically, and militarily. In order to allay
their concerns over China, it is becoming more important for
China to explain its military activities according to the facts
and improve the transparency of its national defense policy
and military capabilities. It is strongly hoped that China will
increase transparency concerning its military affairs by such
efforts as disclosing specific and accurate information.


**Chapter**


6 The defense white papers “China’s National Defense in 2008,” “China’s National Defense in 2010” and “China’s National Defense in the New Era” (2019) provided a breakdown of
personnel expenses, training and maintenance costs, and equipment costs for the limited FY2007, FY2009 and FY2010-2017 defense budget expenditures respectively (furthermore, those
for FY2007 and FY2009 were divided into costs for active force, reserve force and militia).

7 For example, with respect to the incident of a Chinese naval vessel directing its firecontrol radar at a Maritime Self-Defense Force (MSDF) destroyer in January 2013, both the Chinese
Ministry of National Defense and Ministry of Foreign Affairs gave explanations which were inconsistent with the facts; in this case they have denied the use of the radar itself. With regard
to the incident in which Chinese fighters flew abnormally close to MSDF and Air Self-Defense Force (ASDF) aircraft (May and June 2014), the Chinese Ministry of National Defense gave
explanations that were contrary to the truth; it claimed that Japanese aircraft “entered the airspace for the Chinese drills without reporting to China and conducted dangerous acts.”
Furthermore, in 2016, China repeatedly made claims that are contrary to the fact. In the case where Self-Defense Forces (SDF) aircraft scrambled against Chinese aircraft, China claimed
that the SDF aircraft “conducted interference at close distance and shot IR flares, endangering the safety of the Chinese aircraft and its crew.”

8 When asked about the submerged navigation of a submarine at a regular press conference held by China’s Ministry of Foreign Affairs on January 16, 2018, the spokesperson replied, “I do
not have information about the circumstances of submarines.”

Note: This basically shows the defense budget within “the central government’s general public budget,” which had been named as “the central fiscal
expenditures” prior to FY 2014. Year-on-year growth rate compares the budget of a given year against the initial budget of the previous year. Note that
FY2002 defense budget was calculated based on the increased amount from the defense budget in the previous FY because only the amount and rate of
growth were released. For FY 2016, FY 2018 and FY 2019, the amount of “the central government expenditures,” which are part of the central government’s
general public budget, are used because only the central government expenditures were announced.


**Chapter**


In addition, it is noted that the amount of the announced
defense budget is considered to be only a part of its actual
military expenditures.[14] For example, it is believed that
the announced defense budget does not include foreign
equipment procurement costs and research and development
(R&D) expenses.

See Fig. I-2-2-1 (Changes in China’s Announced Defense Budget)


4 National Defense Budget


China announced that its national defense budget for
FY2019 was approximately 1,189.9 billion yuan.[11] This
initial budget amount represented a growth of approximately
7.5% (approximately 82.9 billion yuan)[12] compared to the
initial budget amount for the previous fiscal year. China’s
announced national defense budget has increased at a rapid
pace every year since FY1989.[13] The nominal size of China’s
announced national defense budget has grown approximately
48-fold in the 30 years since FY1989 and approximately 2.5fold in the 10 years since FY2009. China positions the buildup
of defense capabilities as important a task as economic
development. It is believed that China continues to invest
resources in the improvement of its defense capabilities in
tandem with its economic development. Attention is to be
paid to how the slowdown in China’s economic growth
affects China’s national defense budget.


5 Military Posture


China’s armed forces are composed of the PLA, the People’s
Armed Police Force (PAP),[15] and the militia.[16] It is provided
that these bodies be instructed and commanded by the
Central Military Commission (CMC). The PLA is defined as
a people’s force created and led by the CCP, comprising the
Army, the Navy, the Air Force, and the Rocket Force, etc.


11 China’s national defense budget for FY2019 is equivalent to approximately 20,227.9 billion yen when it is mechanically converted using a rate of 17 yen per yuan (FY2019 rate that the
Japanese Government uses for official purposes).

12 As in FY2018 figures for the FY2019 national defense budget were published only as part of the basic expenditures of the central government (which show the sum remaining after local
transfer expenditures and other expenses have been deducted from central government expenditure).

13 China’s announced national defense budget within central fiscal expenditures achieved double-digit growth on the initial-budget basis every year from FY1989 to FY2015 except in FY2010.
14 The U.S. DoD’s “Annual Report to Congress: Military and Security Developments Involving the People’s Republic of China” (May 2019) estimates China’s military-related spending as having
been at least US$200 billion in FY2018.

15 According to the defense white paper “China’s National Defense in 2002,” “(PAP) is to maintain state security and social stability, and assist the PLA in wartime in defense operations.”
Missions of the PAP include security of party and government, border security, social projects, and firefighting activities. The CCP Party and State Institutional Reform Plan released in March
2018 stated it would aim to reorganize the PAP by the end of the year based on the principle that “the military is the military, police are the police, and civil is civil” and that the postreorganization PAP will “mainly carry out patrols, respond to sudden emergencies, engage in counter-terrorism, protect China’s interests and undertake law enforcement at sea, and
implement emergency relief and defense operations.”

16 The militia engages in economic development in peacetime and other activities but has a duty to provide logistics support for combat operations in wartime. The defense white paper “China’s
National Defense in 2002” explains, “[u]nder the command of military organs, the militia in wartime helps the standing army in its military operations, conducts independent operations and
provides combat support and manpower replenishment for the standing army. In peacetime, it undertakes the tasks of performing combat readiness support, taking part in disaster relief

**(1) Military Reform**

China is currently carrying out reforms of the PLA which are
seen as the largest in the country’s history.
In November 2015, President Xi unveiled China’s official
position on a specific direction of the military reforms for
the first time, announcing that the military reforms would be
carried out by 2020, which would include: establishment of
“theaters” and a command structure for joint operations as
well as reduction of troops by 300,000 personnel.
Military reforms have rapidly taken shape. By the
end of 2016 from what are called the “neck up” reforms,
namely the center of the military level up, are reported to
be basically complete. Specifically, they abolished the PLA’s
seven Military Regions[17] and created five new theaters with
primary responsibility for command of operations, namely,
the Eastern Theater, Southern Theater, Western Theater,
Northern Theater, and Central Theater. In addition, they
also formed the PLA Army (PLAA) Headquarters,[18] Rocket
Force (PLARF),[19] Strategic Support Force (PLASSF),[20] and
Joint Logistics Support Force.[21] Moreover, the four general
departments that were the headquarters for the entire PLA
were replaced by 15 functional sections under the CMC,
including the Joint Staff Department, Political Work
Department, Logistic Support Department, and Equipment
Development Department. Since 2017, military reforms
have been making steady progress with the start of what are
called full-scale “neck down” military reforms, namely the
field level. For example, the expansion of the organization of
the Navy Marine Corps, whose mission include amphibious
landing operations, the unification of PAP leadership and
command system under the CMC, and the reorganization
from 18 Group Armies to 13. In March 2018, the Chinese
Ministry of National Defense announced that a reduction of
300,000 personnel had been basically completed.
It is considered that these series of reforms are designed to
build military forces that can fight and win wars by improving
their joint operational capabilities and strengthening the
military’s readiness, including the development of military


capabilities and organizational management from peacetime.[22]
In addition, it has been noted that the reorganization of the
headquarters is a means of tackling corruption at the center
of the military by strengthening the direct leadership of the
CMC and its Chairman and decentralizing the leading organs.
The total number of members of the CMC was reduced from
the number sustained until recently,[23] with seven newly
elected members including Chairman Xi at the 19th National
Congress in October 2017. Since it has been noted that many
people who have deep connections to Chairman Xi were
appointed, it is thought that Chairman Xi’s command of the
CMC, and thus the PLA, is to be further strengthened.
While China is expected to continue these reforms, there
are views that dissatisfaction is growing within the military
because of the rapid military reforms.[24] Attention will focus
on the outcomes of these military reforms, as the reforms
will be completed by 2020.

**(2) Nuclear and Missile Forces**

China has made efforts to independently develop nuclear and
ballistic missile capabilities since the mid-1950s, seemingly
with a view to ensure deterrence, supplementing its
conventional forces, and maintain its voice in the international
community. It is regarded that China’s nuclear strategy is to
deter a nuclear attack on its territory by maintaining a nuclear
force structure able to conduct retaliatory nuclear attacks on
a limited number of targets such as cities in the adversary’s
country, should China be subject to nuclear attack.[25] The
PLARF was newly established with equal status as the Army,
Navy, and Air Force as part of the ongoing military reforms,
suggesting that China will continue to attach importance to

its nuclear and missile forces.
China possesses various types and ranges of ballistic
missiles: ICBM; SLBM; Intermediate-Range Ballistic
Missile (IRBM)/Medium-Range Ballistic Missile (MRBM);
and Short-Range Ballistic Missile (SRBM). The update of
China’s ballistic missile forces from a liquid propellant system
to a solid propellant system is improving their survivability


**Chapter**


17 Shenyang Military Region, Beijing Military Region, Jinan Military Region, Nanjing Military Region, Guangzhou Military Region, Chengdu Military Region, and Lanzhou Military Region.
18 The PLA was considered a large organization of the Army, and therefore, a headquarters of the Army as a service did not exist. The ongoing reforms have given the Navy, Air Force, and
Rocket Force the same status as the Army.

19 The new establishment of PLARF is seen as a de facto elevation of the Second Artillery Force.
20 PLASSF is identified as a new force for maintaining national security. Reportedly it is in charge of cyber, outer space, and electronic warfare capabilities.
21 The Joint Logistics Support Force is considered to be the first Chinese command dedicated to joint logistics support for the armed forces.
22 The report “China’s Incomplete Military Transformation” (February 2015) by the U.S.-China Economic and Security Review Commission and the RAND Corporation identifies the weaknesses
of the PLA as the following: (1) organizational structure (e.g., party-military relations); (2) organizational culture (e.g., corruption); (3) force structure (size of the PLA, recruitment system,
veteran’s benefits); (4) command structure (e.g., military regions); and (5) human capital (e.g., decline in the quality and mindset of new soldiers stemming from the one-child policy, etc.).

23 There were 11 members in both the 17th (2007-2012) and 18th (2012-2017) CMC.
24 Veterans and others held demonstrations in front of the Chinese Ministry of National Defense in October 2016 and near the building that houses the CCP Central Commission for Discipline
Inspection in February 2017. Further demonstrations by them have taken place in several cities since June 2018. While a Ministry of Veterans Affairs was established under the auspices of
the State Council in April that year to improve the treatment of veterans, some view these demonstrations and dissatisfaction with the military reforms as being interrelated.

25 In February 2018, in response to the announcement of the Nuclear Posture Review by the United States, the Chinese Defense Ministry stated that “China adheres to the policy of no-firstuse of nuclear weapons at any time and under any circumstance. Under no circumstances will China use or threaten to use nuclear weapons against non-nuclear-weapon states or
nuclear-weapon-free zones.” On the other hand, the U.S. DoD’s “Annual Report to Congress: Military and Security Developments Involving the People’s Republic of China” (May 2019)

and readiness. Moreover, it is believed that China is working
to increase performance by such means as extending ranges,
improving accuracy, employing Maneuverable Reentry
Vehicle (MaRV) and Multiple Independently targetable
Reentry Vehicle (MIRV).
China’s main ICBM, strategic nuclear asset, had been the
fi xed-site liquid-propellant DF-5 missile. However, China
has in recent years deployed the DF-31, which is a mobiletype ICBM with a solid propellant system mounted onto a
transporter-erectorlauncher (TEL), as well as the DF-31A,
a model of the DF-31 with extended range, and it has been
suggested that China will increase the number of DF-31A in
particular. China is also viewed as developing a new ICBM
known as DF-41. With regard to SLBM, it is considered that
Jin-class SSBNs to carry the JL-2, whose range is expected
to be approximately 8,000 km, are operational. It is believed
that China’s strategic nuclear capabilities will improve
signifi cantly by nuclear deterrence patrols using the Jin-class
SSBNs.[26] Furthermore, it has been pointed out that China is
also developing an extended-range SLBM, called JL-3, and
a new SSBN to carry the SLBM.
As for the IRBM/MRBM covering the Asia-Pacifi c region
including Japan, China has the mobile solid propellant DF21 and DF-26, which can be transported and operated on a
TEL. These are capable of carrying both conventional and
nuclear warheads. China possesses ballistic missiles carrying
conventional warheads with high targeting accuracy based
on the DF-21, deploying the DF-21D anti-ship ballistic
missile (ASBM) carrying conventional warheads, which
could be used to attack overwater ships including aircraft
carrier.[27] The DF-26,[28] which has a range including Guam, is

considered a “second-generation ASBM” developed on the
basis of the DF-21D, and it was announced in April 2018
that it had “formally joined the order of battle.” In addition
to IRBM/MRBM, China possesses the CJ-20 (CJ-10), a
long-range land-attack cruise missile with a range of at least
1,500 km, as well as the H-6, a bomber that is capable of
carrying this cruise missile. It is deemed that these missiles
complement ballistic missile forces, covering the AsiaPacifi c region including Japan. China is likely operating
these ASBMs and long-range cruise missiles to strengthen its
“A2/AD” capabilities. Concerning SRBM, China possesses
a large number of solid-propellant DF-16, DF-15, and DF11, and they are deployed facing Taiwan. It is believed that


their ranges also cover a part of the Southwestern Islands
including the area surrounding the Senkaku Islands, which
are inherent territories of Japan.
Furthermore, China is believed to be rapidly developing
several hypersonic glide vehicles in order to acquire strike
capability that will be able to penetrate missile defenses;
these include a model called the WU-14 on a ballistic missile
for launch.[29] In August 2018, China is believed to have tested
a hypersonic glide vehicle featuring the “waverider” design.
Moreover, it has also been pointed out that progress is being
made on the development of the DF-17 missile capable of
carrying hypersonic glide vehicles.[30] These are said to be
more diffi cult for missiles to intercept, because they fl y low
at very high speeds and are highly maneuverable.
China is also thought to be devoting energies to the
development of missile defense technology. It is believed
to have conducted several tests on midcourse missile
interception technology since 2010.[31] Given that ballistic
missile defense technology has the potential to be applied to
missiles capable of destroying satellites, attention will focus
on future Chinese ballistic missile defense trends.

China has the third largest ground forces in the world,
following India and North Korea, with approximately

sought to modernize its military by curtailing the number of
personnel and streamlining organizations and systems through
reforms, including those currently being implemented, in

order to improve operational capabilities while pursuing

26 The U.S. DoD’s “Annual Report to Congress: Military and Security Developments Involving the People’s Republic of China” (May 2019) indicates that “China continues to produce the JINclass SSBN, with four commissioned and two under rig” and that the SSBNs, which are equipped with JL-2 SLBMs, “are the country’s fi rst viable sea-based nuclear deterrent.”

27 DF-21D is called the “carrier killer” (Annual Report of the U.S.-China Economic and Security Review Commission [November 2015]).

28 DF-26 is called the “Guam killer” (Annual Report of the U.S.-China Economic and Security Review Commission [November 2015]).

29 China reportedly conducted total seven fl ight tests of its WU-14 from January 2014 to April 2016. Some reports refer to it as DF-ZF.

30 DF-17 fl ight tests were reported to have been conducted on November 1 and 15, 2017.

31 China claims that these tests were missile interception technology tests. However, it is pointed out that this was actually an anti-satellite weapon (ASAT) test. (See Chapter 3, Section 2-22 )

**Chinese Modernization of Missile Forces**

China has rapidly modernized its missile forces in recent years. Apparently symbolizing the modernization is the upgrading
of the Second Artillery Corps as the core component of China’s missile forces to the Rocket Force at the end of 2015.
In the modernization of nuclear forces, it is said that China has implemented initiatives to ensure nuclear counterattack
capability to maintain nuclear deterrence, on the premise of strict political control over the capability. For example, China
has been switching from liquid-fuel missiles to solid-fuel ones and from fi xed launching sites to road-mobile launchers
to enhance the survivability and readiness of its nuclear forces. China has also been modernizing its naval and air nuclear
weaponry. Since 2007, China has commissioned four Jin-class SSBN to carry the JL-2 submarine-launched ballistic
missiles (SLBM) with an estimated range of about 8,000 km. It is pointed out that China has been planning and developing
the longer-range JL-3 SLBM and a new SSBN. It is also pointed out that China has been developing nuclear-capable air-
launched ballistic missiles.
In the modernization of conventional missile forces, China has been enhancing its so-called anti-access/area denial (A2/
AD) capabilities to win a limited local war by developing the capability to conduct precision attacks while forestalling
enemy attacks. China has also been improving precision guidance capabilities for ballistic and cruise missiles and extending
cruise missile range. For example, the DF-21D anti-ship ballistic missile, “the aircraft carrier killer,” is viewed as capable of
attacking overwater moving targets with competent terminal guidance technology. It is estimated that the CJ-20 long-range
land-attack cruise missile with an estimated range of about 1,500 km can be mounted on the H-6K bomber to attack Guam
and other targets within the Second Island Chain.
China’s missile forces are put outside the framework of the U.S.-Russia Intermediate-range Nuclear Forces (INF) Treaty.
China has deployed numerous ground launched missiles with a range between 500 and 5,500 km that would be subject to
dismantlement under the INF Treaty, prompting the United States to assert that another framework is required to control
missile forces, including those of China.
It is also believed that China gives priority to capabilities to break through enemy missile defense systems. China is
thought to continue efforts to improve its capability of maneuverable reentry vehicles (MaRVs) and multiple independently-
targeted reentry vehicles (MIRVs) and, in addition, to develop hypersonic glide vehicles (HGVs) and other so-called game-
changing technologies. Relevant future efforts are attracting attention.

military units. Specifically, it is believed to be improving
mobility using measures such as switching from the past
regional-defense model to a full mobile model, and working
to motorize and mechanize its infantry. China is also
believed to be strengthening its airborne troops (belonging
to the Air Force), amphibious forces,[32] special operations

forces, and helicopter units. China is undertaking efforts to
build a command system for improving its joint operational
capabilities and operational efficiency, as well as carrying
out reforms to improve its logistical support capabilities.
China has annually conducted maneuver-exercises that
cut across multiple regions such as Stride, Firepower, and
Sharp Sword. They are aiming at verifying and improving
the capabilities necessary to deploy army troops to remote
areas, such as long-distance maneuvering capabilities of
the army, and logistical support capabilities that include
mobilizing militias and public transportation. Furthermore,
China has conducted combined military branch and service
exercises under Joint Action since 2014, while a Central
Theater Command Army brigade and the PLA Strategic
Support Force reportedly have carried out joint training in

**(4) Naval Forces**

The naval forces consist of three fleets: North Sea Fleet;

East Sea Fleet; and South Sea Fleet. The Chinese Navy
has approximately 760 ships (including approximately 60
submarines), with a total displacement of approximately 1.9
million tons. China’s naval forces are rapidly modernizing,
and the Chinese Navy promotes the mass production of its
indigenous Yuan-class submarines with superior quietness, as
well as surface combatant ships with improved air defense
and anti-ship attack capabilities. The Navy is also developing
Renhai-class destroyers, the largest in the Navy, which are said
to be equipped with a vertical launch system (VLS) capable
of launching long-range land-attack cruise missiles and YJ18 anti-ship cruise missiles with a supersonic terminal attack
capability.[33] It has also been noted that China is developing
submarines capable of carrying land-attack cruise missiles. In
addition, the Navy is increasing the number of large landing


32 The Navy Marine Corps, whose duties are thought to include amphibious assault and the defense of bases in the South China Sea, is also being enhanced. In its annual report “Military and
Security Developments Involving the People's Republic of China” (May 2019), the U.S. DoD states that China’s Navy Marine Corps will be increased in strength to 30,000 personnel by 2020
and sees it likely that this force will also undertake expeditionary operations overseas.

33 It was reported in June 2017 that China launched the first Renhai-class destroyer, and had launched a total of four vessels by July 2018. The first one, “Nanchang,” appeared at the

2016, the Liaoning participated in its fi rst comprehensive
live action, live fi re exercise in the Bohai Sea with other
vessels, including live fi ring by carrier-based fi ghters.
Furthermore, later in the same month, it was confi rmed that
the carrier advanced, together with multiple vessels, to the
Pacifi c Ocean and the South China Sea. It was announced
that the “Liaoning” advanced to the Pacifi c Ocean and
conducted force-on-force training including carrier-based
fi ghters from March to April 2018 after its participation
in a naval review in the South China Sea. These activities
are believed to indicate a further expansion of the distant
deployment capability of the Chinese Navy. An indigenous
aircraft carrier thought to be an improved version of the
“Liaoning” with a ski-jump fl ight deck was launched in April
2017 and has been engaged in pre-commissioning sea trials
since May 2018. Furthermore, China is reportedly building
its second indigenous aircraft carrier, and it is suggested that
this carrier is possibly equipped with an electromagnetic
catapult system.[35]

In view of these developments concerning the naval
forces, China appears to be steadily building up capabilities

to near sea defense.[36]

maritime militia is playing the role of the front guard for
supporting China’s maritime interests.[37] The maritime militia
is said to operate in the South China Sea, etc.[38] and consist
of fi shermen and residents of isolated islands. However, the
details of the maritime militia have not been revealed. Given
the China’s emphasis on the necessity of “fully exerting the
overall power of the military, police and militia” on the seas,[39]
attention is to be paid to these asymmetrical forces, too.[40]

**(5) Air Forces**

The Chinese Navy and Air force have approximately 2,890
combat capable aircraft in total. As for the fourth generation


35 It is suggested that China is conducting research on the electromagnetic aircraft launch system in order to overcome the limitations of the ski-jump confi guration, namely, few weapons
and little fuel can be carried on the carrier-based fi ghter and fi xed-wing early warning aircraft cannot be operated. Additionally, in February 2018, major Chinese conglomerate China
Shipbuilding Industry Corporation announced for the fi rst time the construction of a nuclear-powered aircraft carrier in its development strategy outline on its website, but later deleted the
text.

36 China’s defense white paper “China’s National Defense in the New Era” (July 2019) identifi es that the PLA Navy “has a very important standing in the overall confi guration of China’s
national security and development,” as well as “is speeding up the transition of its tasks from defense on the near seas to protection missions on the far seas” “so as to build a strong and
modernized naval force.”

37 In April 2013, when Chairman Xi Jinping visited the maritime militia of Hainan Province to give encouragement, he reportedly gave instructions to the maritime militia to collect information
on distant seas and actively conduct island construction activities and stated, “you are playing the role of the vanguard in protecting our maritime interests.”

38 For example, when Chinese naval and other vessels obstructed the U.S. Navy surveillance ship Impeccable on the high seas on the South China Sea in March 2009, maritime militia were
said to be aboard the fi shing boat that tried to take away a sonar from Impeccable. It is also pointed out that when the deep-water drilling rig Haiyang Shiyou 981 conducted prospective
drilling to the south of the Paracel Islands from May to July 2014, steel-hull fi shing boats maned by maritime militia also arrived as an escort fl eet.

39 Instructions by Defense Minister Chang Wanquan (then) when he made an observation tour of the maritime militia equipment in Zhejiang Province in August 2016.

fi ghters, China has imported from Russia the Su-27 fi ghter
and the Su-30 fi ghter having anti-surface and anti-ship attack
capabilities. In November 2015, China reportedly signed
an agreement with a Russian state-run military company to
purchase 24 Su-35 fi ghters, considered the newest fourth
generation fi ghter, and is believed to have already taken
delivery of all 24 fi ghters. China is also developing its own
domestic modern fi ghters. China also has started the mass
production of the J-11B fi ghter, which is allegedly a copy
of the Su-27 fi ghter, and the domestic J-10 fi ghter. China’s
domestic J-16 fi ghter, thought to be a copy of Russia’s Su30 fi ghter, has been put into deployment as combat-ready.
China’s domestic J-15 carrier-based fi ghter thought to be
modeled on Russia’s Su-33 carrier-based fi ghter is carried
on the aircraft carrier “Liaoning.” Additionally, China is
considered to have started deploying the J-20 fi ghter, said
to be the fi fth-generation fi ghter, to operational units, and is
also developing the J-31 fi ghter.[41]

China is also continuing the modernization of its bombers
with ground attack capabilities, and the Chinese Air Force
has increased the number of H-6K bombers, which are
believed to be capable of carrying land-attack cruise missiles
with nuclear capability. The Chinese Air Force is believed to
be developing new stealth bombers including a long-range
one called the H-20.
China is also making continuous efforts to improve
capabilities which are essential for operations of modern
air forces by introducing the H-6U and the IL-78M tanker
and KJ-500 and KJ-2000 early warning and control aircraft.[42]

Furthermore, in July 2016, China started the deployment
of the indigenously developed Y-20 large cargo aircraft in

order to enhance its transportation capability. China is also
rapidly developing a variety of domestic unmanned aerial
vehicles (UAVs),[43] including those capable of long-duration
fl ights at high altitude for reconnaissance and other purposes
(high-altitude long endurance [HALE]) and those capable
of carrying weapons including missiles. Some of these are
deployed and are actively exported. In fact, it is suggested
that the Chinese Air Force has created an unmanned aerial
vehicle unit with an attack role. In addition to the frequent
use of UAVs for reconnaissance and other purposes in its
surrounding sea areas and airspace, domestically, it is noted
that China is improving “Swarm” technology[44] to operate a
large number of low-cost UAVs.

Judging from the modernization of the Navy Aviation
and the Air Force, it is believed that China is not only
improving its defense capabilities for its national airspace,


41 It is suggested that in the future, the J-31 fi ghter could be turned into a carrier-based fi ghter or be exported.

42 The AG-600—the largest amphibious aircraft in the world, which China is developing indigenously—made its fi rst fl ight in January 2018 and is believed to have carried out its fi rst take-off
and landing on water that October. Although it is claimed that it will be used for civilian purposes such as natural resource research, the possibility of its conversion to military use has been
pointed out and some take the view that it will facilitate swift transport of personnel and supplies to the South China Sea. It has also been reported that China and Ukraine signed an
agreement for consultations concerning the large transport aircraft An-225 for export to and production in China.

43 UAVs being developed by China include the HALE UAV “Xianglong” (Soar Dragon), considered the “Chinese Global Hawk;” the BZK-005, a UAV that can be used for multiple purposes, such
as reconnaissance, communications relay, and signals intelligence; the GJ-1 “Wingloong” attack UAV; the CH-4 “Caihong;” and the CH-7 “Caihong.”

**(6) Space, Cyber, and Electromagnetic Spectrum Capabilities**

Information gathering and command and communication
in the military sector, which are vital for swift and efficient
exercise of military strength, increasingly rely on satellites
and computer networks. As such, China stated that “outer
space and cyberspace have become new commanding
heights (capture point) in strategic competition among all
parties,” and seems to recognize the importance of taking
an information mastery in wartime, when it must protect its
own information systems and networks while neutralizing
those of its adversaries at the same time. China is considered
to be emphasizing operational capabilities for information
operations.[46] In fact, China established the PLASSF at the
end of 2015 with a mission pointed out to be responsible for
outer space, cyberspace, and electronic warfare.
China is said to have developed its space program in


Chinese small UAV drones using “swarm” technology [Jane’s by IHS Markit]

but also making steady efforts to build up capabilities for air
superiority and anti-surface and anti-ship attacks in further
distant areas and for long-range transportation.[45]


See Fig. I-2-2-4 (Major Chinese Navy and Air Forces)


45 The defense white paper “China’s National Defense in the New Era” (July 2019) identifies “building airspace capabilities and conducting offensive and defensive operations” as a strategy
for enhancing the military capabilities of the Air Force.

46 While the definition of information operations differs depending on the country, the PLA internally uses the definition of “actions using comprehensive electronic war, computer and network

**(7) Efforts to Develop Joint Operational Capabilities**

In recent years, initiatives have been under way to improve
joint operational capabilities. The CMC Joint Operations
Command Center is believed to have been established
as part of the initiatives for the CCP to carry out decision
making at the highest strategic level. These actions have
also been continuing during the current military reforms,
and five new theaters, joint operation headquarters, were
established in February 2016. Furthermore, as in January
2017, Vice-Admiral Yuan Yubai became the first non-army
theater commander, it is assumed that progress is being
made towards joint operations from the viewpoint of human
resources. Given also that General Secretary Xi Jinping
spoke about developing “strong and efficient joint operations
commanding institutions for theater commands” and
enhancing joint operational capabilities at the Party’s 19th
National Congress in October 2017, these developments are
thought likely to progress further. Moreover, in recent years,
China has demonstrated a powerful awareness of practical
warfare, conducting exercises with the aim of enhancing
joint operational capabilities, such as the three services’ joint
exercise held in 2018 for the second consecutive year.

6 Waters and Airspace Activities


**(1) General Situation**

Recently, China is believed to be aiming to build up capabilities
to conduct operations in more distant waters and airspace.
China has rapidly expanded and intensified its activities in the
maritime and aerial domains using its naval and air powers.
Specifically in the waters and airspace surrounding Japan,
Chinese naval vessels, and navy and air force aircraft have
been observed conducting training and information gathering
activities, as well as naval vessels heading for distant waters
such as Indian Ocean. A large number of Chinese government
ships that belong to maritime law enforcement agencies and
their aircraft have been observed engaging in monitoring
activities for the protection of its maritime rights and
interests. These activities include: intermittent intrusions into
Japan’s territorial waters by Chinese government vessels;
intrusions into Japan’s airspace; and dangerous acts that
could cause unintended consequences, including a Chinese
vessel’s direction of a fire-control radar at an Maritime SelfDefense Force (MSDF) destroyer, the flight of Chinese
military fighter jets abnormally close to an Self-Defense


the shortest time in the world. In December 2016, China
published the white paper “China’s Space Activities,” which
emphasizes the peaceful use of outer space but does not
deny its use for military purposes.[47] In addition, it has been
pointed out that public sector and state-owned enterprises
involved in the use of space in China have close ties with
the military, and it is considered that China is planning to
improve its military operational capabilities in space.[48]
Examples of China’s projects include the launch of the
“BeiDou” positioning satellites to form a global satellite
positioning system referred to as the Chinese version of
GPS; this system is believed to have gone into operation
worldwide in late 2018. Another example is a launch of an
Earth observation satellite that is suggested to possibly be
a reconnaissance satellite for military purposes. Moreover,
China is thought to be developing weapons including antisatellite weapons using missiles and laser equipment, as well
as killer satellites,[49] in order to restrict and interfere with the
use of space-based assets by adversaries in wartime.
China has also announced that it will “improve capabilities
in support of the awareness of the state of cyberspace, cyber
defenses, national cyberspace warfare.” It has been noted
that current major military training always contains cyber
operations such as both attack and defense of command
systems. Cyber attacks on enemy networks are likely to
bolster China’s “A2/AD” capabilities.
It has also been pointed out that the Chinese military
routinely conducts various force-on-force exercises in an
electronic warfare environment. In addition, the presence of
aircraft with electronic warfare capability has been noted.
Not only Y-8 electronic warfare aircraft, which frequently fly
near Japan, but also J-15 fighters and H-6 bombers that appear
to be equipped with electronic warfare pod systems giving
them electronic warfare capabilities are pointed out. A close
watch on developments will continue to be required, because
strengthened capabilities in the new domains of space, cyber,
and electromagnetic spectrum will not only result in greater
operational capabilities throughout the Chinese military, but
also lead to improved asymmetrical capabilities to effectively
impede enemies from exerting their strength.

Chapter 3 Section 3 (Trends in Cyber Domain)

Chapter 3 Section 4 (Electromagnetic Domain Trends)


**Chapter**


47 “China’s Space Activities 2016” states the objective of space exploration as utilizing outer space for peaceful purposes to promote human civilization and social progress and provide
benefits to all humankind. At the same time, it also includes references to the demands of national security.

48 The Worldwide Threat Assessment (January 2019) by the U.S. Director of National Intelligence pointed out that China is continuing to improve its military and intelligence capabilities in
space.

entry into the Pacifi c Ocean and waters surrounding Japan.[50]
At the same time, it appears that China continues to improve
the quality of its activities, and efforts can be seen to build
practical joint operational capabilities.
**a. Activities in the East China Sea (including the Areas**
**around the Senkaku Islands)**
Chinese naval vessels have been conducting operations in the
East China Sea continuously and actively.[51] Stating its own
position regarding Japan’s Senkaku Islands, China alleges
that patrols by Chinese naval vessels in the sea areas under
its jurisdiction are completely justifi able and lawful. Chinese
naval vessels have recently expanded the sea area of their
regular activities to the south, and are continuously operating
in the area near Japan’s Senkaku Islands. In June 2016, a
Jiangkai I-class frigate of the Chinese Navy entered Japan’s


Forces (SDF) aircraft, and activities that could infringe upon
the freedom of overfl ight, such as the establishment of the
“East China Sea ADIZ.” Also in the South China Sea China
is moving forward with militarization, as well as expanding
and intensifying its activities in the maritime and aerial
domains. It is strongly expected that China will act on the
basis of the principle of the rule of law, and that it will play
active roles in the region and the international community in
a more cooperative manner.

See Chapter 3, Section 5 (Maritime Trends)

**(2) Military Developments in Japan’s Surrounding Waters and**
**Airspace**

The Chinese Navy and Air Force have in recent years
expanded and intensifi ed their activities in the surrounding sea
areas and airspace of Japan, including the area surrounding
the Senkaku Islands. They are also conducting activities
based on a unilateral claim on the Senkaku Islands, and cases
involving the one-sided escalation of activities have been
seen, creating a situation of great concern to Japan. The Air
Self-Defense Force (ASDF) has continued to make frequent
scrambles against Chinese aircraft, having reached an all-time
high of 851 times in FY2016. It is thought that China intends
to make a regular occurrence of the navigation of waters
surrounding Japan by naval vessels making forays to the
Indian Ocean and other distant waters, and of activities that
appear to be Navy and Air Force exercises which accompany

the four agencies, excluding “Maritime Safety Administration,” into the new
“State Oceanic Administration” and that the new organization would carry
out surveillance and other activities under the name of “China Coast Guard”
(Zhongguo Haijing) under the guidance of the Ministry of Public Security.
From July 2018, these maritime security units were placed under the
command of the People’s Armed Police (PAP) and ultimately the Central
Military Commission as the People’s Armed Police Coast Guard, but
maintained the original name of China Coast Guard.

In June 2016, one navigated through Japanese territorial
waters near the Kuchinoerabujima and Yakushima
Islands, subsequently navigated within the contiguous
zone of Kitadaitojima Islands, and fi nally navigated back
and forth east-west outside the contiguous zone off the
south of the Senkaku Islands. It also navigated back and
forth outside the contiguous zone off the southeast of the
Boso Peninsula in February 2016 and other occasions.


50 Concerning the PLA, there is a view that by turning exception into normality through combining peacetime and wartime force deployment and exceeding traditional activity spaces, China
attempts to desensitize the alertness of others and make the international community tolerate and accept changes in the situation (Taiwan’s 2009 National Defense Report).

51 For example, a China Military Online article (October 21, 2015) reported that in recent years, the average number of days in a year that all major combatants in the East Sea Fleet of the

contiguous zone around the Senkaku Islands. This was the
first time a Chinese Navy combatant vessel entered Japan’s
contiguous zone around the Senkaku Islands. Furthermore,
in January 2018, a Shang-class submerged submarine and
a Jiangkai II-class frigate passed into the contiguous zone
around the Senkaku Islands on the same day. This was the
first time a submerged Chinese submarine was identified and
announced as transiting through these contiguous waters off
the Senkaku Islands.[52]

In recent years, Chinese Navy intelligence gathering
vessels (AGIs) have also been found conducting multiple
activities. A Chinese Navy Dongdiao-class AGI repeatedly
navigated back and forth outside of the contiguous zone south
of the Senkaku Islands in November 2015. In June 2016, the
same type of AGI sailed in Japan’s territorial waters near
Kuchinoerabujima Island and Yakushima Island, and then
sailed within Japan’s contiguous zone north of Kitadaitojima
Island. Subsequently, the vessel repeatedly conducted eastwest passages outside the contiguous zone south of the
Senkaku Islands. This was the first navigation by a Chinese
Navy vessel in approximately 12 years in Japanese territorial
waters .[53]

China’s air forces are also actively conducting activities in
the East China Sea on a routine basis. Their activities include
warning and surveillance, Combat Air Patrols (CAP), and
training. PLA aircraft have been expanding their areas of
activity eastward and southward in recent years. As a result of
this incremental expansion, PLA aircraft have recently been
confirmed conducting activities actively in airspace closer to
the main island of Okinawa and the rest of the Southwestern
Islands. The intent of the expanded activities of PLA aircraft

may be to operate the “East China Sea ADIZ.”[54]

In May and June 2014, incidents occurred where two
PLA Su-27 fighters came abnormally close to MSDF and
ASDF aircraft that were conducting normal warning and
surveillance activities in the East China Sea[55]. In addition,
in July 2017, two PLA J-10 fighters reportedly intercepted a
U.S. Navy EP-3 electronic reconnaissance aircraft. These are
dangerous acts that may have unintended consequences. And
in April 2018, an unmanned aerial vehicle presumed to be


a Chinese BZK-005 unmanned reconnaissance vehicle was
confirmed to be flying over the East China Sea.
Regarding Japan’s airspace over and around the Senkaku
Islands, territorial airspace intrusion by a fixed-wing aircraft
of the State Oceanic Association (SOA) in December
2012 marked the first such instance by a Chinese aircraft.
Subsequently, aircraft of the SOA were frequently observed
flying near the airspace up through March 2014.[56] Recently,
the scope of the activities of PLA aircraft near the Senkaku
Islands has been expanding in the southward direction. In
June 2016, ASDF fighters scrambled against PLA aircraft
that flew southward closer to the Senkaku Islands. The
Chinese Ministry of National Defense released an official
announcement that ran contrary to the facts, stating that SDF
aircraft conducted provocations against the PLA aircraft.
However, SDF aircraft conduct scrambles in accordance with
international law and the SDF Law, and it is never true that
SDF aircraft conducted provocations against PLA aircraft.
**b. Advancements into the Pacific Ocean**
Chinese Navy combatant vessels continue to transit the
waters near Japan to advance into the Pacific Ocean and
return to base with high frequency.[57] The advancement routes
are multiplying. Chinese naval vessels have been confirmed
transiting the sea area between the main island of Okinawa
and Miyakojima Island, and have been found passing through
the Osumi Strait, sea area between Yonagunijima Island and
Nakanokamishima Island near Iriomotejima Island, the sea
area between Amamioshima Island and Yokoatejima Island,
Tsugaru Strait, and Soya Strait. By diversifying routes
in this manner, China appears to be aiming to enhance its
deployment capabilities to the open ocean, and considering

remarks from high-ranking government officials, it is
thought that China is also planning to make deployments
to the Pacific Ocean sailing through waters near Japan
regular activities.[58] Furthermore, considering the nature
of the activities it is conducting in distant areas, China is
presumably aiming to enhance operational capabilities
on the open ocean. In December 2016, the aircraft carrier
Liaoning navigated the East China Sea together with other
vessels and passed the sea area between the main island of


**Chapter**


52 In June 2018, a Japan Coast Guard patrol ship confirmed that the Chinese Navy Anwei-class hospital ship navigated the contiguous zone around the Senkaku Islands.
53 In November 2004, a Chinese nuclear submarine conducted “submerged passage through the territorial sea of another country” in Japanese territorial waters in violation of international
law.

54 In November 2016, a spokesperson of the PLA Air Force stated that the PLA Air Force had been continuously conducting patrols of the “East China Sea ADIZ”. See Chapter 3, Section 5-1
(Trends Related to the “Principle of the Freedom of the High Seas”)

55 See Chapter 3, Section 5-1 (Trends Related to the “Principle of the Freedom of the High Seas”)
56 For example, on March 7, 2011, a Chinese Z-9 helicopter believed to belong to the SOA flew as close as approximately 70 m and as low as approximately 40 m above water around MSDF
Destroyer JS “Samidare,” which was patrolling the waters in the central area of the East China Sea. On April 12, 2012, a Y-12 aircraft believed to belong to the SOA flew as close as
approximately 50 m and as low as approximately 50 m above water around MSDF Destroyer JS “Asayuki.”

57 The number of times Chinese Navy combatant vessels have been active in the waters around the Southwestern Islands, Soya Strait and Tsugaru Strait since 2008 is: 3 times (2008), 2
times (2009), 4 times (2010), 5 times (2011), 13 times (2012), 21 times (2013), 14 times (2014), 12 times (2015), 15 times (2016), 12 times (2017), 15 times (2018), and 8 times (as of the
end of June 2019, based on SDF announcements).

58 In March 2017, when Japan announced the transit of Chinese naval vessels between the main island of Okinawa and Miyakojima Island, a Chinese Ministry of National Defense
k id “All J d t d i t d t th f t th t ill th h ti i th f t ”

Okinawa and Miyakojima Island to advance to the Pacific
for the first time. In April 2018, the aircraft carrier Liaoning
and a number of vessels participated in a naval review and
training in the South China Sea, and the Chinese Ministry
of National Defense announced that they passed through the
Bashi Channel to advance to the Pacific and conducted forceon-force exercises that included carrier-based fighters. At
that time, the MSDF, conducting warning and surveillance,
confirmed for the first time the vessel used by what are
presumed to be carrier-based fighters for take-off and landing
on the Pacific Ocean. Moreover, the aircraft carrier Liaoning
advanced to the Pacific Ocean through the sea area between
the main island of Okinawa and Miyakojima island in June
2019, together with vessels such as a fast combat support
ship pointed out to be for supplying the aircraft carrier group.
The activities are worthy of attention as an indicators of the
enhancement of the capabilities of China’s naval forces,
including aircraft carriers, and enhancement of its force
projection capabilities to distant areas. With a Chinese Navy
Shang-class submarine passing submerged from the Pacific
Ocean toward the East China Sea from Japan’s contiguous
zone northeast of Miyakojima Island in January 2018, it is
thought that submarines also conducted some activities in the
Pacific. In addition, in July 2017, a Chinese Navy Dongdiaoclass AGI sailed through Japan’s territorial waters southwest
of Matsumae-kojima Island in Matsumae, Hokkaido, and
subsequently sailed eastward through Tsugaru Strait and
advanced to the Pacific Ocean.
Regarding the advancement of air forces into the Pacific
Ocean, the advancement of a PLA Navy Y-8 early warning
aircraft into the Pacific Ocean, passing between the main
island of Okinawa and Miyakojima Island, was confirmed
for the first time in July 2013. The advancement of Air Force
aircraft into the Pacific was also confirmed in 2015. Since
2017, advances into the Pacific Ocean via this airspace have
become more active, with flights totaling 18 passages in
2017, and 10 in 2018. This is a significant increase from the
five flights confirmed in 2016.[59] The types of aircraft passing
through the airspace are also diversified year by year. The
H-6K bombers and Su-30 fighters were confirmed by 2016
and the first Y-8 EW aircraft in July 2017. It was confirmed
by sight that at least one of the H-6K bombers that flew in
September 2016 carried objects in the form of missiles.[60]


Flight patterns have also been changing. Flights from the
East China Sea to the Pacific Ocean, passing between the
main island of Okinawa and Miyakojima Island, and from
the direction of the Bashi Channel to the Pacific Ocean, both
with the return trips on the same shuttle routes, have been
repeatedly made. Since November 2016, H-6K bombers and
other aircraft were frequently confirmed to be flying from the
south of the Sakishima Islands to the East China Sea, passing
between the main island of Okinawa and Miyakojima Island,
and from the East China Sea toward the Bashi Channel
passing between the main island of Okinawa and Miyakojima
Island.[61] In August 2017, H-6K bombers advanced to airspace
off the Kii Peninsula after advancing to the Pacific Ocean via
passage between the main island of Okinawa and Miyakojima
Island. Through the conduct of frequent long-distance flights
of bombers and other aircraft, and the advanced flight paths
and composition of military units, China is thought to be
demonstrating its presence around areas including those
surrounding Japan, and planning further enhancements to
more practical operational capabilities. With regard to SDF
aircraft scrambles against PLA aircraft advancing into the
Pacific Ocean in October and December 2016, the Chinese
Ministry of National Defense made false announcements
that SDF aircraft shot IR flares, endangering the safety of the
Chinese aircraft.[62] However, there is absolutely no truth to
these announcements; SDF aircraft conducted scrambles in
accordance with international law and the SDF Law.
Additionally, activities considered to be planned to
improve the capability to carry out sea and air joint
operational capabilities, such as activities like air-to-ship
attack drills when entering the Pacific Ocean, have also been

seen in recent years.[63] China’s naval and air activities in the
Pacific Ocean will be expanded and intensified further, and
continued attention is to be paid for related trends.
**c. Activities in the Sea of Japan**
While the Chinese Navy has been active in the Sea of
Japan during training and on other occasions for some time,
its Air Force activities in the area have also intensified of
late. “Force-on-force exercises” in the Sea of Japan by
Chinese Navy forces were announced for the first time in
August 2016, during which three aircraft participated in the
exercise, including two H-6 bombers that passed through the
Tsushima Strait into the Sea of Japan. In January 2017, naval


**Chapter**


59 Since 2013, air forces have passed between the main island of Okinawa and Miyakojima Island to advance to the Pacific Ocean 5 times (2013), 5 times (2014), 6 times (2015), and 5 times
(2016).

60 The U.S. DOD’s “Annual Report to Congress: Military and Security Developments Involving the People’s Republic of China” (August 2018) states that the H-6K bomber’s ability to carry the
CJ-20 (CJ-10) land attack cruise missile, which allows for more long-distance attacks, allows China to target as far as the second island chain including Guam. It then pointed out that the
Chinese military appears to be actually carrying out training in which the United States and its allies and partners are the targets.

61 When flights of this nature were confirmed in December 2017, a Chinese Air Force spokesperson stated that they were “‘island (Taiwan) encirclement’ drills.”
62 See Section2-2-6 (4); Chapter 3, Section 5-1 (2)
63 For example, when H-6 bombers and Su-30 fighters made forays into the Pacific Ocean via the Bashi Channel in December 2018, two combatant vessels were also navigating waters in
th i i it l di t t k th i th t th d i j i t ti


-----

vessels and aircraft were said to have carried out joint forceon-force exercises in the same area, in which eight aircraft,
including six H-6 bombers passed through the Tsushima
Strait to the Sea of Japan.
The Chinese Air Force flew through the Tsushima Strait
for the first time in December 2017 to advance to the Sea of
Japan. This passage included the simultaneous transit of the
H-6K bombers and Su-30 fighters, and were the first Chinese
fighter aircraft to advance into the Sea of Japan. In addition,
the Y-9 intelligence gathering aircraft that entered the Sea of
Japan in February 2018 flew through the Western Channel
(the strait between Tsushima in Nagasaki Prefecture and the
Korean Peninsula) of the Tsushima Strait, and was the first
time for a flight through the channel.[64]

Activities in the Sea of Japan involving passages through
the Tsushima Strait intensified further in 2018, with 17
passages by the Navy and eight overflights by the Air
Force confirmed over the course of the year. This marks a
substantial increase from the numbers confirmed in 2017
(four passages and two overflights). **[65] It is considered that**
the PLA will continue to expand and intensify its activities
in the Sea of Japan.

**(3) Activities of Chinese Government Vessels Especially**
**Around the Senkaku Islands**

In December 2008, China Maritime Surveillance vessels
hovered and drifted inside Japan’s territorial waters
around the Senkaku Islands. These are not permitted under
international law. Since then, China Maritime Surveillance
and China Fisheries Law Enforcement Command vessels
have intensified their activities in the aforementioned

territorial waters. Such activities have been intensified greatly
after September 2012, when the Japanese Government
acquired property rights to and ownership of three of the
Senkaku Islands (Uotsurishima Island, Kitakojima Island,
and Minamikojima Island). Since October 2013, Chinese
government vessels have repeatedly intruded into these
territorial waters, and the posture of the intrusions have
become more reinforced.[66]

China is seen to be steadily strengthening an operational
posture intended to use Chinese government vessels to intrude
into Japan’s territorial waters. For example, since December
2015, Chinese government vessels carrying weapons that
appear to be cannons have begun to repeatedly intrude into

Senkaku Islands [Courtesy of the Japan Coast Guard]

Japan’s territorial waters. Additionally, government vessels
deployed to seas near the Senkaku Islands are increasingly
larger in size, with at least one of the government vessels
intruding into Japan’s territorial waters being a 3,000 tons or
larger-class vessel since August 2014. Since February 2015,
three 3,000 tons or larger-class government vessels have been
confirmed entering Japan’s territorial waters simultaneously
multiple times. China is also presumed to operate two of the
world’s largest 10,000 ton-class patrol vessels.[67]

It appears that the operational capabilities of Chinese
government vessels in the sea areas around Japan are also
improving. In early August 2016, approximately 200-300
Chinese fishing boats advanced to the contiguous zone off
the Senkaku Islands. At that time, as many as a maximum
of 15 Chinese government vessels were confirmed in the
contiguous zone simultaneously, and later for five days a large
number of Chinese government vessels and fishing boats
repeatedly intruded into territorial waters. It was confirmed
that the government vessels that advanced into those waters
included many armed vessels.[68] This case appears to indicate
that China has the capability to simultaneously inject a large
number of government vessels including armed vessels in
the sea area around the Senkaku Islands.
These activities of Chinese government vessels in the sea
area around the Senkaku Islands are attempts to unilaterally
change the status quo by coercion. China’s actions to escalate
the situation are totally unacceptable.
In May 2017, it was confirmed that an object that appeared
to be a small drone was flying above a Chinese government
vessel intruding into Japanese territorial waters around the
Senkaku Islands. This flight also constitutes an invasion of


**Chapter**


64 The ROK Joint Chiefs of Staff announced that the PLA aircraft carried out “unusual reconnaissance activities” within South Korea’s ADIZ.
65 In 2016, the PLA Air Force flew over the Tsushima Strait into the Sea of Japan three times, while the number of instances of its Navy sailing through the Tsushima Strait into the Sea of
Japan each year since 2008 is as follows: 1 in 2008, 0 in 2009 and 2010, 2 in 2011, 0 in 2012, 2 in 2013, 1 in 2014, 2 in 2015, and 6 in 2016.

66 While with some exceptions, Chinese government vessels often intrude into Japan’s territorial waters two to three times a month from around 10 a.m. for about two hours. The number of
vessels had been two to three until August 2016. Since then, four vessels often intrude into territorial waters in a group.

67 “China Coast Guard 2901” and “China Coast Guard 3901” are also reportedly conducting test navigation. These government vessels allegedly carry a 76 mm cannon.

the situation.
Besides the waters around the Senkaku Islands, Chinese


government vessels were confi rmed to be passing through
the territorial waters of Japan around Tsushima (Nagasaki
Prefecture), Okinoshima Island (Fukuoka Prefecture) and
the Tsugaru Strait in July 2017. The same vessels were also
confi rmed to have sailed in Japan’s territorial waters from
Sata Cape to the Kusagakiguntou Islands (both in Kagoshima
Prefecture) in August that year.
Retired Navy vessels are believed to have been handed
over to the China Coast Guard (CCG),[69] that was formally
launched in July 2013. It was reported that the Navy and the
CCG conducted a coordinated drill. It appears that the Navy
is supporting maritime law enforcement agencies on both the
operations and equipment fronts. In July 2018, the CCG was
incorporated into the PAP under the centralized leadership
and command of the Central Military Commission. The
way of the military and the CCG cooperation in the future is
worthy of attention.[70]

**(4) Trends in Activities in the South China Sea**

China has also been intensifying its activities in the South
China Sea, including waters around the Spratly Islands and
the Paracel Islands, over which territorial disputes exist with
neighbors, including some ASEAN member states.
Since 2014, on seven features in the Spratly Islands,[71]
China pressed ahead with large-scale and rapid land
reclamation works.[72] The Philippines-China arbitration award
issued in July 2016 denied the “historic rights” as the basis
of the “nine-dash line” claimed by China, and determined
the illegality of China’s activities such as land reclamation.
However, China has made it clear that it would not comply
with the award and is currently continuing to militarize the
features, with the development of military facilities, such
as batteries, and various kinds of infrastructure that can be
used for military purposes including runways, ports, hangars,
and radar facilities.[73] During the 19th National Congress in
October 2017, General Secretary Xi reported the progress of
the land reclamation work in the South China Sea as one of
the accomplishments of economic development.
In Fiery Cross Reef, a large harbor capable of receiving
surface combatants was constructed. In January 2016,
China declared completion of a 3,000 meter-long runway
which fighters and bombers can take off from and land on,
and aircraft test flights were conducted willfully against the
protests from countries in the area.[74] In April 2016, a Navy
patrol aircraft flying over the South China Sea landed at Fiery
Cross Reef to evacuate emergency patients. At Subi and
Mischief Reefs, in July of the same year, China conducted
aircraft test fights willfully for two straight days on a runway
where large aircraft can take off and land.[75] In January 2018,
Y-7 transport aircraft were reported on Mischief Reef, and
Y-8 special mission aircraft were confirmed on Subi Reef
later in April that year. It has been noted that batteries
capable of being equipped with anti-aircraft guns, missile
shelters, underground facilities which are pointed out to be
ammunition storages, are being built on these features. It has
also been noted that the construction of this infrastructure
has been completed. Additionally, in April 2018, it was
reported that anti-ship cruise missiles and anti-surface cruise


missiles were deployed in Fiery Cross, Subi and Mischief
Reefs as part of a military training, and that radar jamming
systems were deployed on Mischief Reef. On the other four
features, it is pointed out that the construction of facilities,
such as harbors, helipads, and radars, has made progress and
that what appears to be large anti-aircraft guns and close in
weapon systems (CIWS) may have already been deployed.
If these features are used for full-scale military purposes, it
could significantly change the security environment in the
Asia-Pacific region.
China has similarly carried out militarization of the
Paracel Islands before its militarization of the Spratly
Islands. China has extended the runway on Woody Island
since 2013. In October 2015 and October 2017, China was
reported to deploy J-11 and other fighters, and in February
2016 and January 2017, the existence of equipment likely to
be surface-to-air missiles was confirmed. It has been noted
that the takeoff and landing training of the H-6K bombers
in the South China Sea announced by the Chinese Ministry
of National Defense in May 2018 was carried out on Woody
Island.
In recent years, Chinese vessels have allegedly been
conducting what are likely to be survey activities in
Scarborough Shoal, where a standoff took place between
Chinese and Philippine government ships in April 2012. It
is pointed out that new land reclamations in the shoal might
be seen in the future.[76] It is also pointed out that if China
conducts land reclamations and installs radar facilities,
runways, and other infrastructure in Scarborough Shoal, it
could possibly increase its ability to track the situation and
power projection capabilities in the surrounding sea area and

ultimately enhance its operational capabilities throughout all
the areas of the South China Sea. Attention must continue to
be paid to the situation going forward.
The activities of the PLA in sea areas and airspace are
expanding and intensifying as well. In March 2009, December
2013 and September 2018, Chinese naval and other vessels
approached and intercepted a U.S. Navy vessel navigating
in the South China Sea. In May 2016, February 2017 and
May 2017, a PLA fighter allegedly flew close to U.S. Forces


**Chapter**


71 The seven features are: Johnson South Reef; Cuarteron Reef; Gaven Reefs; Hughes Reef; Fiery Cross Reef; Mischief Reef; and Subi Reef.
72 The U.S. DoD’s “Annual Report to Congress: Military and Security Developments Involving the People’s Republic of China” (June 2017) notes that China added over 3,200 acres of land in
the Spratly Islands by late 2015 and completed the land reclamation.

73 The international community also has repeatedly suggested that China is militarizing its activities in the South China Sea. For example, the U.S. DOD’s “Annual Report to Congress: Military
and Security Developments Involving the People’s Republic of China” (August 2018) states “The United States opposes further militarization of disputed land features,” recognizing that
“China’s reclamation activities have far surpassed that of other claimants.” In June 2018, then Secretary of Defense James Mattis said, “China’s militarization of artificial features in the
South China Sea includes the deployment of anti-ship missiles, surface-to-air missiles, electronic jammers, and more recently, the landing of bomber aircraft at Woody Island.”

74 China is believed to have conducted three test flights at Fiery Cross Reef on January 2, 3, and 6 of 2016. In response, the spokesperson of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of Vietnam
expressed strong opposition on January 2, and the Philippines protested in writing on January 8.

75 On July 14, 2016, the spokesperson of the Vietnam Ministry of Foreign Affairs protested that it was an infringement on Vietnamese sovereignty.
76 In March 2016, with regard to China’s activities near Scarborough Shoal, U.S. Chief of Naval Operation John Richardson stated, “I think we see some surface ship activity and those sorts of
things, survey type of activity, going on. That’s an area of concern...a next possible area of reclamation.” Moreover, in November 2018, it was reported that China installed a facility of what
appears to be an information collection sensor on the Bombay Reef in the Paracel islands without undergoing massive reclamation. The possibility of China conducting the same type of

Chapter 3, Section 5 (Maritime Trends)

**(5) Trends in the Indian Ocean and Other Seas**

The Chinese Navy is considered to be shifting its naval
forces towards “protection missions on the far seas,” and is
steadily increasing its capabilities to conduct operations in
more distant seas such as the Indian Ocean in recent years.
For example, since December 2008, Chinese Navy vessels
sail in the Indian Ocean to the coast of Somalia and the Gulf
of Aden to take part in international counter-piracy efforts.
Activities of Chinese Navy submarines are also beginning
to be confirmed continuously in the Indian Ocean. In 2014, a
Song-class submarine reportedly called at a port in Colombo,
Sri Lanka, twice in the same year. This marked the first time
that a Chinese submarine entered a foreign port. It is reported
that in May 2015 and May 2016, a Yuan-class submarine
and a Shang-class submarine respectively called at a port in
Karachi, Pakistan, and in January and September of 2017, a
Song-class submarine and another submarine reported to be
a Yuan-class submarine called at a port in Kota Kinabalu,
Malaysia. Besides the Indian Ocean, in September 2015, five
Chinese vessels reportedly sailed in the high seas in the Bering
Sea and sailed in U.S. territorial waters near the Aleutian
Islands. Moreover, in January 2018, China published a white
paper entitled “China’s Arctic Policy,” which mapped out a
policy of active involvement in Arctic initiatives, including
efforts to build a “Polar Silk Road” through the development
of Arctic sea routes.
Additionally, China has been remarkably trying to secure
overseas bases such as harbors, which would help support its
operations in far seas. For example, in August 2017, China
began operation of “support base” for logistics support of
the PLA in Djibouti, a strategic point in East Africa facing
the Gulf of Aden, and it has been ascertained that a pier has
been constructed on the coast adjoining the base facilities
since April 2018. As observers have pointed out that 48,000ton supply ships — the largest available class of the PLA —
can be accommodated at this pier, there is a possibility that
this facility will substantially increase the Chinese military’s


aircraft, etc. In July and August 2016, after the PhilippinesChina arbitration award was rendered, PLA Air Force H-6K
bomber aircraft conducted “combat air patrol” in the airspace
close to Scarborough Shoal. The Chinese Ministry of
National Defense announced that this patrol would “become
normal.”[77] In September of the same year, the China-Russia
joint naval exercise “Joint Sea 2016” was conducted for the
first time in the South China Sea. A field training exercise
by naval vessels including the aircraft carrier “Liaoning”
and a naval review ceremony, regarded as the largest since
the founding of China, was conducted in the same area from
the end of March until April 2018. It is also reported that
Chinese naval vessels are constantly active in some waters
of the South China Sea.[78]There was an event where Chinese
government vessels fired warning shots at fishing boats of
neighboring countries. In this manner, it appears that China
seeks to expand its military and other forms of presence and
enhance its operational capabilities in the South China Sea.[79]

Such activities by China unilaterally change the status quo
and further advance its efforts to create a fait accompli. Japan
is deeply concerned about these activities, and the concern
is shared with the international community, including the
United States.[80] In response to the growing international
concerns over the development on the features, China
asserts that some of the ASEAN member states including
the Philippines and Vietnam are illegitimately occupying
features of the Spratly Islands and carrying out large-scale
construction work to build fixed facilities such as airstrips.[81]
However, China’s development work on the features is of
a scale incomparable to the activities carried out by other
countries and is conducted at a rapid pace.[82]

In any case, the issues over the South China Sea are of
concern to the entire international community due to their
direct implications for peace and stability of the Asia-Pacific
region. Countries concerned, including China, are urged to
refrain from unilateral actions that heighten tension and act
on the basis of the principle of the rule of law.

See Fig. I-2-2-7 (China’s development on the features of the
Spratly islands)


**Chapter**


77 There are reports that Chinese H-6 bombers flew along the “nine-dash line” in March 2015 and December 2016. Also, in December 2017, the Chinese Ministry of National Defense
announced that its Air Force aircraft carried out “flight training and other activities around the islands.”

78 In November 2017, it was reported in a local newspaper that Delfin Lorenzana, Secretary of National Defense of the Philippines said that Chinese warships were constantly active near
Sandy Cay in the Spratly Islands. In addition, in April of 2018, the Center for Strategic and International Studies (CSIS) and Asia Maritime Transparency Initiative (AMTI) pointed out that the
Chinese Navy and CCG Ships regularly visited the artificial islands in the Spratly Islands.

79 China is reportedly constructing a large-scale naval base that has underground tunnels for nuclear-powered submarines in the city of Sanya located in the southern tip of Hainan island.
Experts point out that the base is in a strategically important location that secures access to the South China Sea as well as the Pacific, and that China is advancing construction work in
order for the base to play a role as a major hub of the South Sea Fleet, including for the deployment of aircraft carrier.

80 As a concern from the United States, for example, in May 2018, the U.S. DOD canceled the PLA’s invitation to RIMPAC stating, “China’s continued militarization of disputed features in the
South China Sea only serves to raise tensions and destabilize the region.” As regards the concerns of the international community, for example, at the G7 Taormina Summit held in May
2017, the Leaders’ Communique stated that “[w]e remain concerned about the situation in the East and South China Seas and strongly opposed to any unilateral actions that could
increase tensions.”

81 Remark by the spokesperson of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of China on April 29, 2015.
82 The U.S. DoD’s “The Asia-Pacific Maritime Security Strategy” (August 2015) states, “As of June 2015, [China] had reclaimed more than 2,900 acres of land” and “China has now reclaimed

logistical support capabilities. In recent years, China has
been promoting its “Belt and Road” Initiative[83] whose main
purpose is advertised as establishing an economic zone in
regions including the Eurasian continent, with the Chinese
military possibly taking on the role of the shield behind the
initiative by such means as the stabilization of areas via
counter-piracy activities and the improvement of counterterrorism capabilities in coastal states through joint exercises.
Furthermore, while it is thought that the initiative includes a
strategic intention to expand its infl uence in the region, it is
possible that the construction of infrastructure based on the
initiative will further promote the activities of the PLA in the
Indian Ocean, Pacifi c Ocean and elsewhere. For example, by
supporting the construction of port infrastructure in Pakistan,
Sri Lanka, and other Indian Ocean countries, it is possible
that China attempts to secure ports to call, and further
improve the operational capabilities of the PLA Navy in the
further waters such as the Indian Ocean.

in defense white papers, China’s geographical location and
globalizing economy, the water and airspace activities of
the Chinese Navy, Air Force and other organizations are
considered to have the following objectives.
The fi rst is to intercept operations by adversaries in waters
and airspace as far as possible from China in order to defend
its territory, territorial waters and territorial airspace. Behind
this objective is an increase in effectiveness of long-range
attacks due to recent progress in science and technology.
The second is to develop capabilities to deter and prevent
Taiwan’s independence. China maintains that it will not allow
any foreign intervention in solving the Taiwan issue and
realizing the unifi cation of China. To ensure the prevention

**KEY WORD**


“Belt and Road” Initiative

A concept for an economic sphere proposed by President Xi Jinping. The “Silk
Road Economic Belt” (“One Belt”) and the “21st Century Maritime Silk Road”
(“One Road”) were announced in September and October 2013, respectively.
Since then, the two concepts are collectively referred to as the “Belt and
Road” Initiative.

of foreign intervention in the Taiwan issue, China needs to
enhance its operational capabilities at sea and airspace as
Taiwan is surrounded by the sea in all directions.
The third is to weaken the control of other countries and to
strengthen the claim through various surveillance activities
and use of force, at sea and in airspace surrounding the island
to which China claims territorial sovereignty.
The fourth is to acquire, maintain, and protect its maritime
rights and interests. China is engaged in oil and gas drilling
as well as building facilities and surveying in the East and
South China Seas. It has been confirmed that in addition to
the existing 4 platforms, China is building 12 new offshore
platforms on the Chinese side of the Japan-China median
line of the East China Sea since June 2013.[84] In late June
2016, the installment of an anti-surface vessel radar and a
surveillance camera was confirmed on one of the platforms.
Attention is to be paid to developments of the platforms
by China, including the purpose of such equipment. Japan
has repeatedly lodged protests against China’s unilateral
development and demanded the termination of such work.[85]

The fifth is to defend its sea lanes of communications. In
the background is the fact that its sea lanes, including its oil
transportation routes from the Middle East, are essential for
the globalizing Chinese economy. The specific areas of its
sea lanes which the Chinese Navy deems to defend depend
on such factors as the international situation at the time.
However, given the recent strengthening of the Chinese Navy
and Air Force, it is believed that they have been developing
a capacity to defend areas past China’s near seas to more
distant seas.
Given these objectives in China’s water and airspace

activities and recent trends, it is believed that China plans to
further expand the sphere of its water and airspace activities,
and further intensify its operations in waters surrounding
Japan, including the East China Sea and the Pacific Ocean,
the South China Sea, and the Indian Ocean.
Meanwhile, in recent years, China has shown interest in
taking steps to avoid and prevent unexpected situations at
sea areas and airspace. For example, in April 2014, China,
together with other countries such as Japan and the United
States, adopted the Code for Unplanned Encounters at Sea
(CUES), which sets forth the standards of behavior in the


case that the naval vessels or aircraft of the Western Pacific
Naval Symposium (WPNS) member states have unexpected
encounters. Also, in June 2018, Japan and China started
implementation of the Maritime and Air Communication
Mechanism between the Defence Authorities of JapanChina to avoid unexpected situations between SDF and PLA
vessels and aircraft.[86]

7 International Military Activities


In recent years, the PLA has been emphasizing nontraditional
security missions such as peacekeeping, humanitarian
assistance and disaster rescue, and counterpiracy. In order to
carry out these missions, it has actively dispatched its units
overseas. It is believed that in the background of the PLA’s
stance on international military activities is the expansion of
China’s national interests beyond its national borders, which
in turn increased its necessity to protect and promote its
national interests overseas, as well as China’s intent to raise
its stature by demonstrating its will to fulfil its responsibilities
to the international community.
China vows to consistently support and actively participate
in UN PKO. According to the Ministry of National Defense
of China, it has sent more than 37,000 military personnel to
it.[87] According to the United Nations, as of the end of April
2019, China has a total of 2,497 troops, civilian police and
military observers — the largest number of peacekeepers
among any of the permanent members of the UN Security
Council — engaged in UN peacekeeping activities, including
the United Nations Multidimensional Integrated Stabilization
Mission in Mali (MINUSMA). China has also largely

increased its UN budget allocation for PKO.[88] China has a
growing presence in UN PKO. It is deemed that underlying
China’s proactive attitude towards UN PKO is China’s wish
to strengthen its relations with the regions where PKO are
conducted, particularly with African nations, by way of these
activities.
Moreover, China has been actively participating in
counter-piracy activities off the coast of Somalia and in the
Gulf of Aden as well as humanitarian assistance and disaster
relief activities. In 2011, in view of the deteriorating situation
in Libya, China carried out a military evacuation of Chinese

84 On November 1, 2016, Foreign Minister Kishida (then) revealed that additional gas field drilling was taking place in that sea area and stated that “it is extremely regrettable that [China] is
continuing with acts towards unilateral development.”

85 With regard to resource development in the East China Sea, in September 2010, China unilaterally announced postponement of the negotiation to conclude an international agreement with
Japan for implementing the so-called “June 2008 Agreement.” While the negotiation has not been resumed yet, it is pointed out that China is highly likely carrying out gas production in the
Kashi gas field (Tianwaitian in Chinese) and elsewhere. Meanwhile, China’s SOA announced that the “Haiyangshiyou 981” oil rig succeeded in its first drilling in the South China Sea in May
2012.

86 See Part III, Chapter 3, Section 1-2 6 (China)
87 According to the Chinese Ministry of National Defense website (May 2019). In September 2017, China announced that it had registered 8,000 troops under the UN Peacekeeping Capability
Readiness System.

nationals for the first time. In 2015, based on the worsening
situation in Yemen, the Chinese Navy’s counter-piracy
forces evacuated foreign nationals, including one Japanese
national, living in Yemen. More recently, when a dam in Laos
collapsed in July 2018, the PLA, which was conducting a joint
medical rescue exercise with the Laotian military at the time,
engaged in rescue operations at the request of Laos. While
these activities have received international praise, it has been
pointed out that, through such activities, China aims to build
a pacifist and humanitarian image of its military forces and
demonstrate, both domestically and internationally, its intent
to place priority on military operations other than war. It is
also suggested that China hopes to test its ability to promptly
project its military power to distant locations.

8 Education and Training


In recent years, the PLA has promoted practical exercises
including large-scale ones such as joint exercises led by theater
commands, force-on-force exercises, landing exercises, and
exercises that step across military regions and theaters, as
well as night-time exercises and joint exercises with other
countries in order to strengthen its operational capabilities.
President Xi repeatedly stating the goal of “being able to fight
and winning battles” is construed as evidence that the PLA
is promoting the implementation of more practical exercises.
The new military training regulations in effect since January
2018 referred to the execution of joint and full-spectrum
operation based on network information systems, in addition
to the definite implementation of practical training as a rule.
Moreover, the trial regulation on the supervision of military
training that took effect in March 2019 is regarded as China’s
first attempt to put in place a system that prescribes measures
to rectify practices that are inconsistent with the requirements
of actual combat and criteria for identifying malpractice and
discipline violations during military training.
In the education spectrum as well, the PLA aims to train
soldiers who have the ability to execute joint operations.
In 2003, it launched a human resource strategy project
to develop human resources capable of directing joint
and informatized operations, and of building joint and
informatized armed forces. It was reported in 2017 that the
PLA National Defense University began training to develop
human resources capable of directing joint operations. On
the other hand, in recent years, a variety of issues have been
raised in relation to benefits, including remuneration, and the


personnel development system.
China outlined the promotion of “rule of law” at the
fourth plenary session of the 18th CCP Central Committee
in 2014, and it is thought that the PLA will also be required
to thoroughly implement the “rule of law.” One example
is Chairman of the CMC Xi Jinping’s comment at the
90th anniversary commemorating the formation of the
PLA held in August 2017 that the “military be controlled
by law.” Additionally, in October of the same year, Miao
Hua, Director of the Political Work Department, and
Zhang Shengmin, Secretary of the Central Commission for
Discipline Inspection, were selected as members of the 19th
Central Military Committee, the supreme decision-making
body in the military.
China has been developing wartime mobilizations systems
in order to effectively utilize private resources in case of
emergencies, including wars. In 2010, China enforced the
National Defense Mobilization Law, which is the basic law
for wartime mobilization into effect. The “civil-military
fusion” policy that China is currently promoting is believed
to have its sights set on the routine military use of civilian
resources. For example, civilian vessels have recently
been observed transporting military equipment and it is
possible that such activities will continue to be proactively
implemented going forward.

9 National Defense Industry Sector


While China imports highly sophisticated military equipment
and parts that it cannot produce domestically from other
countries such as Russia, it is believed that China places
emphasis on enhancing its military industrial sector including
the advancement of producing indigenous equipment to
modernize its military. It has been pointed out that China
is acquiring such equipment not only through an ambitious
program of technology research and development, along
with foreign direct investment, but also via illegal means, in
the form of cybertheft.[89]

The civil-military fusion strategy, which President
Xi views significant as a national strategy, is also being
promoted in the field of defense technology,[90] and reform in
the Chinese defense industry is under progress. Under the
State Administration of Science, Technology and Industry
for National Defense (SASTIND) of the Ministry of Industry
and Information Technology, a department of the State
Council, China has formed 12 group corporations to develop


**Chapter**


89 The U.S. DOD’s “Annual Report to Congress: Military and Security Developments Involving the People’s Republic of China” (May 2019) notes that China uses cyber technology and other
means to acquire foreign sensitive, military and dual-use technologies. In November 2018, the U.S. Department of Justice indicted Chinese intelligence officers on suspicion of having used
cyber attacks and other means to steal aviation technology from private companies in other countries.

**Chinese Civil-Military Fusion**

China in recent years has promoted Civil-Military Fusion (CMF) as a national strategy in addition to the traditional
development of national defense mobilization for the military use (including requisition) of civil resources in emergency.
CMF is viewed to include not only the national defense mobilization system in emergency but also the promotion of the
military use of civil resources in peacetime and in times of emergency as well as the transfer of military technologies to
the private sector.
The promotion of CMF is expected to allow the PLA to improve the efficiency of military force enhancement, taking
advantage of civilian technologies, including high technologies. In fact, President Xi Jinping has reportedly emphasized
initiatives in maritime, space, cyber, artificial intelligence and other “emerging areas for China” as the CMF priorities
at such occasions as the first meeting of the Central Commission for Integrated Civil-Military Development in 2017. In
addition, standardized commercial products in the production stage for potential requisition will be more suitable for actual
requisition. Accordingly, the future effects of CMF on PLA operational capability improvement are attracting attention.


and produce nuclear weapons, missiles, rockets, aircraft,
vessels, and other conventional weapons. In doing so, China
promotes, in particular, two-way technological exchanges
where military technologies are utilized for developing
the national economy, and, in turn, civilian technologies
are absorbed for a buildup of national defense. As a result,
specifically, the technologies of the defense industry have
contributed to the development of civilian space exploration,

**3** **Relations with Countries and Regions**

1 General Situation


China, particularly regarding maritime issues where its
interests conflict with others’, continues to act in an assertive
manner based on its own assertions incompatible with the
existing international order, including attempting to change
the status quo by coercion. China remains poised to fulfill
its unilateral demands without compromise, which has
included making steady efforts to turn its acts into faits
accompli. It has advocated building a “community of shared
future for mankind”[91] and, while referring to promoting the
building of a “New Model of Major Country Relations”
based on mutual respect, equitable justice, cooperation, and
“win-win,” is promoting its “Belt and Road” Initiative as a
national strategy. Furthermore, there have also been moves


the aviation industry, and the shipbuilding industry.
Furthermore, China encourages and supports international
cooperation and competition in dual-use industries. China is
thus thought to have interest in absorbing foreign technologies
through dual-use industries. There is a possibility that the
modernization of the PLA will be further pushed forward
by proactively introducing advanced technologies from
overseas in this way.

toward creating its own international order, including the
establishment of a China-led multilateral mechanism,[92] and
it has been noted that China has tried to influence political
decisions in other countries through efforts such as winning
over foreign politicians.[93] On the other hand, moves to review
projects have been seen among some countries cooperating
in the “Belt and Road” Initiative, due to such factors as their
deteriorating financial situation.
At the same time, China recognizes that a peaceful and
stable international environment is necessary for maintaining
sustainable economic development and enhancing China’s
overall national power. Based on such recognition, China
proactively carries out military exchanges in its relationships
with other countries. In recent years, China has been engaged
in dynamic military exchanges not only with major powers
such as the United States and Russia and with its neighboring


91 General Secretary Xi, at a Central Conference on Work Relating to Foreign Affairs in June 2018, underlined the “thought on socialism with Chinese characteristic for a new era,” specifically,
the enforcement of the building of” a community with a shared future for humanity,” the progress of “Belt and Road” Initiative, the development of global partnerships and leading the
reform of global governance systems.

92 China seeks to implement its own initiatives in the security realm; at the Conference on Interaction and Confidence-Building Measures in Asia (CICA), China criticized military alliances and
proposed “the security of Asia by the people of Asia.” In the international finance domain as well, China plays a leading role in establishment of the New Development Bank (BRICS
Development Bank) and the Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank (AIIB).

93 In submitting an amendment to national security legislation to the Parliament of Australia in December 2017, then Australian Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull said in his speech, “Media
reports have suggested that the Chinese Communist Party has been working to covertly interfere with our media, our universities and even the decisions of elected representatives right

countries including Southeast Asian countries, but also with
countries in Africa and Latin America. At the same time,
the objectives of China’s promotion of military exchanges
are thought to include alleviating other countries’ concerns
regarding China by strengthening its relations with these
countries, creating a favorable security environment for
China, enhancing China’s infl uence in the international
community, securing stable supplies of natural resources,
and building foreign bases. China is believed to position
military exchanges as a strategic means to safeguard its
national interests.

Abnormal approach by a Chinese naval vessel to a U.S. Navy vessel, reportedly occurred
in the South China Sea [Jane’s by IHS Markit]

grounds of China’s unfair trade practices over many years.
China has also responded with countermeasures such as the
phased raising of import duties. **[95] Furthermore, the United**
States regards China as one of the “revisionist states” trying
to shape the world along its own authoritarian model, and
has indicated that the re-emergence of long-term strategic
competition by these revisionist powers is a central challenge
to its prosperity and security. With this as a backdrop, the
United States recognizes that China is pursuing regional
hegemony in the Indo-Pacifi c in the near future through the
modernization of its military and other efforts.[96] Additionally,
in the MDR published in January 2019, the U.S. DoD
indicated that it perceives the missile capabilities of China
and other states as a threat to the military forces of both the
United States and its allies. China has strongly opposed such
a perspective by the United States.
Regarding the Senkaku Islands, the United States has
reiterated that the Japan-U.S. Security Treaty applies to
the islands. This was confi rmed in a document between
the Japanese and U.S. leaders for the fi rst time in February
2017, in the joint statement from the fi rst Japan-U.S. Summit
Meeting since the inauguration of the Trump administration,
which explicitly referred to the application of Article 5 of
the Treaty to the Senkaku Islands. China has shown strong
protest to these views. With regard to the issues over the
South China Sea, the United States is concerned about such
dimensions as obstruction to the freedom of navigation in
sea lanes, restrictions on the activities of U.S. Forces, and the
worsening security situation in the entire region. The United
States has requested China to comply with international
norms, and has repeatedly criticized China’s unilateral and


**Chapter**

3 Relations with the United States


There are various issues between the United States and China,
such as trade issues, issues concerning the South China Sea,
the Taiwan issue, and human rights issues in China. However,
China deems its relationship with the United States as one of
the world’s most important bilateral relationships and appears
to be aware that a stable U.S.-China relationship is essential
in enhancing its national power, including the development
of its economy. Accordingly, while demonstrating an
uncompromising stance on its “core interests and major
concerns,” China is trying to further develop relations with
the United States through mutual respect and “win-win”
cooperation.[94] Although China and the United States are
thought to want stable bilateral relations to continue going
forward, the recent movements of both countries keeping
each other in check are attracting great concern.
Since the start of the Trump administration, the United
States has made frequent statements on the necessity of
cooperation between the United States and China on issues
such as North Korea. At the same time, it also called on
China to uphold international rules and norms on global
issues, including international trade and maritime security.
Amid this situation, the Trump administration has been
toughening its stance on China since June 2018 through
such measures as the phased raising of import duties, on the


94 Then Vice President Xi Jinping fi rst used the “New Model of Major-Country Relations” in talks with then U.S. President Obama during his visit to the United States in 2012. China explains
that the concept is based on: (1) no confl ict, no-confrontation; (2) mutual respect; and (3) win-win cooperation. However, it is said that President Xi Jinping made no mention of it when he
met with U.S. President Donald Trump after April 2017.

95 For example, the United States has expressed criticism of China’s “Made in China 2025” hi-tech industrial development policy of subsidies and other measures, on the grounds that it
involves unfair business practices that improperly disadvantage the economies of the United States and other countries. China’s foreign investment law was passed at the second annual
session of the 13th National People’s Congress, which took place in March 2019. While the law includes provisions banning forced technology transfer from foreign companies and
imposing legal liability in respect of infringements of intellectual property rights, some have questioned its effectiveness.

assertive actions.[97] And the United States also implements
the Freedom of Navigation Operation[98] in the South China
Sea to counteract excessive claims to maritime interests by
other countries such as China. In May 2018, DoD disinvited
China to RIMPAC held in that year because of “China’s
continued militarization of islands in the South China Sea.”[99]
That September, a Chinese naval vessel came within 45
yards (about 41 meters) of US Destroyer Decatur when it
was conducting Freedom of Navigation Operations in the
South China Sea.
Embracing these differences, it can be seen that both the
United States and China have continued military exchanges
in a relatively stable manner.[100] A hotline between the
defense authorities of the two countries was set up in April
2008. In November 2014 and September 2015, the United
States and China announced that they agreed on confidencebuilding measures aimed at reducing the risk of unintended
encounters. China has also dispatched observers to U.S.
military exercises, and joint exercises have been conducted
between the Chinese and U.S. navies on the occasions
of mutual port visits. In addition, the U.S. and Chinese
militaries have engaged in annual humanitarian and disaster
relief exercises since November 2013. After the inauguration
of the Trump administration, both countries frequently
mentioned the importance of bilateral military exchanges,
and a series of new dialogue frameworks were launched.
For example, in April 2017, it was decided at the U.S.China Summit Meeting that the U.S.-China Diplomatic and
Security Dialogue would be established as part of the new
U.S.-China Comprehensive Dialogue, and the first meeting
was held in June of the same year and the second meeting
was held in November 2018.[101] Also in 2017, the U.S.-China
Joint Staff Dialogue Mechanism was established and the first
dialogue was held in November of the same year.
However, there are movements which indicate change
in the military exchanges that have transitioned rather
stably in recent years. The second dialogue under the Joint
Staff Dialogue Mechanism, which was due to take place
in September 2018, was reportedly postponed. Moreover,
the Defense Authorization Act for FY2019, which includes
a clause to prohibit inviting China to RIMPAC until the


demilitarization of the South China Sea is achieved, was
approved in the U.S., and the U.S. also decided not to send its
vessels to the International Fleet Review that China hosted in
April 2019.
While wanting a better relationship with China, the
United States has demonstrated an uncompromising stance
on matters concerning its own security and economy.
Developments in U.S.-China relations will continue to
require close monitoring with keen interest.

4 Relations with Russia


Ever since the so-called China-Soviet confrontation ended
in 1989, China and Russia have placed importance on their
bilateral relationship. They have emphasized the deepening
of their “strategic partnership” since its establishment in
the mid-1990s. In 2001, the China-Russia Treaty of GoodNeighborliness and Friendly Cooperation[102] was concluded. In
2004, the long-standing issue of border demarcation between
the two countries came to a settlement. The two countries
have a common view on promoting the multipolarization of
the world and the establishment of a new international order,
and have further deepened their relations.
On the military front, since the 1990s, China has purchased
modern weapons from Russia, including fighters, destroyers,
and submarines. Russia is currently the largest supplier of
weapons to China.[103] Meanwhile, their trade amounts are
said to be declining in recent years due to the advancement
of indigenous weapon production in China; however, it is
suggested that China still shows strong interest in continuing
to import Russia’s advanced equipment. For example, as

well as introducing what are believed to be the latest fourth
generation Su-35 fighters, China signed a contract in 2014 to
purchase S-400 surface-to-air missile systems from Russia.
Delivery of these missile systems began in 2018 and the
Chinese military is reportedly testing them. At the same
time, it is pointed out that Russia, which shares a land border
with China, has a policy of not supplying sophisticated
weapons to China that would cause a threat to Russia and of
differentiating the performance of the weapons it exports. It
is also suggested that Russia has concerns about competing


**Chapter**

98 See Chapter 2 Section 1-1 for the “Freedom of Navigation Operation” conducted by the U.S. in the South China Sea.
99 Chinese naval vessels participated in the same exercise conducted in 2014 and 2016.
100 There were instances in the past, when the U.S. DoD notified Congress of the sale of weapons to Taiwan in October 2008 and January 2010, where China notified the United States
to cancel the major military exchanges with them. However, in cases of recent notices, although China vigorously protested, it has made no remarks about canceling military exchanges
with the United States, and has taken a more restrained approach than in the past.

101 It was reported that, at both 1st and 2nd meetings, consultations were held on the issue of North Korea, the South China Sea, and U.S.-China military exchanges, among other
matters.

102 Regarding the military field, this treaty mentions military confidence building or strengthening of mutual troop reductions in border areas, military cooperation such as military
technical cooperation, and holding discussions in the event that there is awareness of any threat to peace.

with China in arms exports.[104]

Military exchanges between China and Russia take place
in such forms as routine mutual visits by senior military
officers and joint exercises. For example, in 2018, China
participated in the Vostok 2018 exercise, which is said to
have been one of the largest Russian military exercises since
the end of the Cold War. Additionally, the two countries have
held the large-scale naval joint exercise “Joint Sea” since
2012,[105] and held it, for the first time, in the Baltic Sea and
Sea of Okhotsk in 2017. In 2016 and 2017, the two countries
held “Aerospace Security,” a joint missile defense computersimulated exercise. China likely regards these exchanges
as an opportunity to learn about the operating methods of
Russian-made weapons and the operational doctrine of the
Russian Armed Forces, which have combat experience.
Furthermore, China holds the joint counter-terrorism exercise
“Peace Mission” between China and Russia or among the
Shanghai Cooperation Organization (SCO; established in
June 2001) member countries including China and Russia.[106]

In addition, China and Russia made a bombers’ flight, in
which they gathered in the Sea of Japan, to the East China
Sea in July 2019 with China’s announcement of “the first
time joint strategic flight.”

5 Relations with Other Countries


**(1) Relations with Southeast Asian Countries**

As for its relations with countries in Southeast Asia, reciprocal
summit-level visits and other activities continue to be carried
out actively. China is also actively involved in multilateral
frameworks such as ASEAN Plus One (China), ASEAN Plus
Three (Japan, China, the ROK) and AARF. In November
2018, Premier Li Keqiang attended multilateral meetings
in Singapore including the ASEAN Plus One Summit.
Furthermore, China has developed bilateral relations through
infrastructure development support, etc. under the “Belt and
Road” Initiative.
On the military front, China has made efforts toward
military confidence building, such as the first ASEAN

China Maritime Field Training Exercise, which took place
in October 2018, following on from a tabletop exercise held
that August. In September 2017, a submarine identified to be
a Yuan-class submarine also visited Malaysia. These efforts
can also be considered to have the objective of securing
bases for the activities of the PLA Navy in the distant sea
areas of the Indian Ocean.
Some ASEAN member states are likely to have concerns
about China’s advance into the South China Sea, but in 2018,
no conflicts between China and these countries over territorial
rights in the South China Sea have apparently intensified. The
Philippines instituted arbitral proceedings[107] against China
regarding their disputes over the South China Sea, including
Scarborough Shoal and Second Thomas Shoal, in accordance
with the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea
(UNCLOS). In July 2016, a final arbitration was made where
most of the content of the allegations were accepted. However,
against the backdrop of China providing the Philippines with
substantial economic support, the Philippines is said to have
refrained from referring to the ruling.[108] The statement at the
31st ASEAN Summit in November 2017, when the Philippines
held the chair, mentioned improved relations between China
and ASEAN, and did not express any concerns about the
situation in the South China Sea.[109] However, concerns about
the situation in the South China Sea were expressed anew in
the Chairman’s Statement of the 32nd ASEAN Summit (April
2018), which was chaired by Singapore. At the same time,
in July 2017 and March 2018, the Vietnamese government
reportedly made foreign companies engaged in oil drilling in
the South China Sea with the permission of the Vietnamese
government cancel the drilling under the pressure from China.

This is regarded as an example of China flexing its muscles
with its unilateral demands. Additionally, China and ASEAN
are continuing to discuss the formulation of the Code of
Conduct of Parties in the South China Sea (COC) and Chinese
Premier Li Keqiang announced in November 2018 that he
hoped to complete negotiations within three years.

See Chapter 3 Section 5 (Maritime Trends)


**Chapter**


104 It is suggested that China is plagiarizing, copying, and reverse-engineering military science technologies, including redesigning its own J-11B fighter based on the Russian-made
Su-27 fighter. Feeling strong discontent and casting doubts over China, it is suggested that Russia is cautious about supplying state-of-the-art equipment to China, such as the Su-35
fighter and the S-400 surface-to-air missile. For example, Russia has allegedly requested that the agreement regarding the supply of Su-35 fighters requires the payment of a vast amount
of compensation if China produces copied fighters. It has also been noted that Russia may supply only the S-400 missiles with relatively short ranges.

105 Joint Sea was held in April 2012, July 2013, May 2014, May and August 2015, and September 2016 in the Yellow Sea, the Sea of Japan off the coast of Vladivostok, northern East
China Sea, the Mediterranean Sea, the Peter the Great Gulf, and the South China Sea, respectively. Although it did not take place in 2018, it was held from April to May in 2019 off the coast
of Tsingtao and within Chinese territorial waters.

106 The Peace Mission exercise was held among China and Russia in August 2005, July 2009, and July to August 2013, and among the SCO member countries including China and
Russia in August 2007, September 2010, June 2012, August 2014, September 2016, and August 2018.

107 See Chapter 3, Section 5-1.
108 It had been pointed out that over the last several years China had been dispatching maritime law enforcement vessels appearing to belong to the CCG around Scarborough Shoal
to interfere with Philippine fishing boats approaching the Shoal. According to CSIS/AMTI, it was confirmed that Philippine fishing boats were operating around Scarborough Shoal even after
the Philippines-China Summit Meeting in October 2016. In November of the same year, the spokesperson of the Chinese Ministry of Foreign Affairs stated that “the matter of Philippine
fishermen conducting fishing was dealt with appropriately based on friendship.”

**(2) Relations with Central Asian Countries**

The Xinjiang Uyghur Autonomous Region, located in
the western part of China, is situated next to Central Asia.
It shares borders with the three countries of Kazakhstan,
Kyrgyzstan, and Tajikistan. It has ethnic minorities settled in
the areas straddling borders, and there are lively exchanges
between the people of those countries. Therefore, China is
deeply concerned about the political stability and security
situations, such as terrorism by Islamic extremists in Central
Asian states. Such concerns of China appear to be reflected
in China’s engagement in SCO. Some note that China has
recently been beefing up its involvement in efforts to stabilize
the situation in Afghanistan. Moreover, China is strongly
interested in the abundant natural resources of Central Asia,
with a view to diversify its supply source and procurement
methods of these resources. China promotes cooperation in
the energy field with Central Asian countries, such as the
construction of oil and natural gas pipelines between China
and Central Asian nations.

**(3) Relations with South Asian Countries**

China has traditionally maintained a particularly close
relationship with Pakistan, and mutual visits by their
summit leaders take place frequently. Their cooperation
in the military sector, including exporting weapons and
transferring military technology, is also considered to be
deepening. As the importance of sea lanes increases for
China, it is believed that the importance of Pakistan is rising
for China accordingly, partly because of the geopolitical
features of Pakistan which faces the Indian Ocean. The
China-Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC), a development
plan for power facilities and transportation infrastructure
in the region stretching from the Port of Gwadar, where
China is assisting construction, to Kashgar in the Xinjiang
Uyghur Autonomous Region, is a flagship project of the
“Belt and Road” Initiative. While some have pointed out
that the project has run into difficulties due to Pakistan’s
deteriorating financial situation, the project’s progress is
expected to increase China’s influence in Pakistan.[110]

China and India have undemarcated border areas.[111]
Additionally, China and Bhutan, which has close relations
with India, claim territorial rights over the Doklam Plateau,
and the area saw a standoff between Chinese and Indian


military forces that lasted from June to August 2017. On
the other hand, China has recently striven to improve its
relationship with India, while also paying consideration
to maintaining balance with Pakistan.[112] Because China
identifies the relationship with India as a strategic partnership,
the leaders of the two countries actively conduct mutual
visits. As a background to progress the relations with India,
there seems to be an emphasis on economic growth of the
two countries, and a response to closer US-India relations.
In recent years, China has also been deepening its relations
with Sri Lanka. Initially after taking office, President
Maithripala Sirisena, who had campaigned to shift from
a diplomacy oriented towards China to ominidirectional
diplomacy and won the election in January 2015, suspended
the Colombo Port City development projects financed by
China. However, he subsequently announced the resumption
of the projects in January 2016, and new development
projects with China are also showing progress. In July
2017, an agreement was reached to lend interests to Chinese
enterprises at the Port of Hambantota, which is being
constructed with Chinese loans. Some have noted that
these moves constitute what has been described as a “debt
trap.” Additionally, China is deepening its relations with
Bangladesh, such as by developing the harbor in Chittagong
where a naval base is located and exporting arms.[113]

With regard to military exchanges, China has conducted
a variety of joint exercises with Pakistan and India since
2003, including joint naval search and rescue exercises and
counter-terrorism exercises. In December 2018, China and
India resumed their joint “Hand-in-Hand” counter-terrorism
exercise, which had been interrupted by the Doklam standoff.

**(4) Relations with European Countries**

For China, the European Union (EU) countries are now as an
important partner as Japan and the United States, especially
in the economic field. China, strongly requests EU countries
to lift their arms embargo against China which has been
imposed since the Tiananmen Square incident in 1989.[114]

EU member countries possess more advanced military
related technologies than China or Russia regarding
information communication technology, avionics, and air
independence propulsion (AIP) systems for submarines and
other areas. Therefore, if the EU arms embargo on China were


**Chapter**


110 China announced that it would invest US$46 billion in CPEC. Although China is reported to have increased the sum it plans to invest to US$62 billion, it has been noted that some
individual projects have been subject to delays and cancellations.

111 They include the Kashmir region and the state of Arunachal Pradesh.
112 At the meeting with Prime Minister Mohdi of India in September 2017, President Xi Jinping is reported to have stated that “China and India must adhere to the basic judgment that
they will regard each other as chances for development and not pose a threat to each other.”

113 According to SIPRI, Bangladesh accounts for 16% of China’s arms exports from 2014 to 2018, which is the second largest share.
114 For example, in November 2010, then Chinese President Hu Jintao visited France, and on this occasion, China and France announced a joint statement that included text supporting
the lifting of the arms embargoes against China. It is deemed that some EU countries have positive opinions about the lifting of their arms embargoes against China. In its December 2018

lifted, the weapons and military technologies of EU countries
could transfer to China and be utilized as a bargaining chip to
gain the edge in weapons transactions with Russia. Although
it was explicitly stated in the EU’s strategy against China,
which was adopted for the first time in 10 years in July 2016,
that the position concerning the arms embargo against China
remains unchanged, there is still need to pay continuous
attention to future discussions within the EU.
Additionally, China and Ukraine have close ties in the
field of arms procurement, as indicated by China’s purchase
of the unfinished Ukrainian Kuznetsov-class aircraft
carrier “Varyag,” which was the basis of the aircraft carrier
“Liaoning.” Therefore, the relationship between these two
countries will attract attention going forward.[115]

**(5) Relations with Middle East and African Countries, Pacific**
**Island countries, and Central and South American**
**Countries**

China has been enhancing its relations with Middle Eastern
and African nations in the economic realm, including
providing active assistance for their infrastructure
development and investment in their resource and energy
development, and has been further expanding its influence
in the region. In recent years, not only are there intensive
interactions among state leaders and senior military officials,
but also arms exports and exchanges between military
forces are actively conducted. China also actively dispatches
personnel to undertake UN PKO in Africa. Some view that
underlying these movements could be China’s aim to ensure
a stable supply of natural resources and to secure overseas
bases in the future. In December 2016, São Tomé and
Príncipe severed diplomatic relations with Taiwan, followed
by Burkina Faso in May 2018, while re-establishing relations
with China.
In terms of China-Australia relations, a Chinese company’s
agreement with the Northern Territory Government of
Australia to lease Darwin Port raised debates over security.[116]

China has also been boosting its relations with the Pacific
island countries. Its activities in Papua New Guinea include
resource development and it has signed an agreement on
military cooperation with the country. Though proactive and
continuous economic assistance has also been implemented
in other islands, Australia and other countries have also
expressed their concerns over these activities by China.[117]


Furthermore, moves to bolster military-related ties with
Vanuatu, Fiji and Tonga are also being seen.
China has been striving to further deepen its relations with
Central and South American countries. For example, Chinese
senior military officials have continuously visited countries,
such as Argentina and Brazil and ministerial meetings
between China and the Community of Latin American and
Caribbean States (CELAC) have taken place since 2015. In
June 2017, Panama severed diplomatic relations with Taiwan,
followed by the Dominican Republic and El Salvador in May
and August 2018, respectively, while establishing relations
with China.

6 International Transfer of Weapons


The total of China’s arms exports have surpassed the total
of imports since 2013. China has been expanding provision
of weapons such as small arms, tanks, aircraft, and UAVs
to developing countries in Asia, Africa, and other areas.
Specifically, it is reported that the main recipients are
Pakistan, Bangladesh, and Myanmar, while weapons are also
being exported to African countries such as Algeria, Nigeria,
Sudan, Tanzania, Ghana, and Kenya, to Central and South
American countries including Venezuela, and to Middle
Eastern countries such as Iraq and Iran. Some claim that
China transfers weapons in order to strengthen its strategic
relationships with friendly nations, enhance its influence in
the international community, and secure natural resources.
China does not participate in some of the frameworks of
international arms export control, and some point out that
there is proliferation of missile-related technology and others
from China.[118] Attention will be paid to whether China will
increase the transparency of international weapons transfer
in response to the concerns of the international community.

**KEY WORD**


Arms embargo against China

EU countries announced the suspension of arms sales to China as a measure
against the suppression of human rights in China during the Tiananmen
Square incident in 1989. However, the actual embargoed items are ultimately
left to the interpretation of the individual member countries. China continues
to seek the lifting of the arms embargo against China, and there are
movements towards reconsideration within the EU.


115 China appears to be continuing its development of the engine for its fifth-generation fighter aircraft and, through stock acquisition and the establishment of a joint venture, is
reportedly trying to promote cooperation with Ukrainian company Motor Sich, which has advanced engine manufacturing technology.

116 In November 2015, at the U.S.-Australia Summit Meeting in Manila, then U.S. President Obama reportedly told his counterpart that the United States would have liked a “heads up”
about Australia’s lease of Darwin Port to a Chinese company and to “Let us know next time.”

117 In January 2018, Australia’s Minister for International Development and the Pacific, Concetta Fierravanti-Wells, was reported to have said that China’s investments in infrastructure
in several Pacific island countries were “basically white elephants” and that “we don’t know what the consequences are when [nations] have to pay back some of these Chinese loans.”

118 For example, China does not participate in the Missile Technology Control Regime (MTCR), and some observers point to proliferation of Chinese missile-related technology to

actions, claiming them to be “actions taken by China that
compress the international space of Taiwan.”
At the same time, China also announced preferential
measures to encourage people to move from Taiwan to
China to study or work and, among other remarks,[125] General
Secretary Xi stated at the 19th National Congress in October
2017 that China “would like to share the development
opportunities on the mainland with our Taiwan compatriots.”
In a January 2019 speech at an event commemorating the
40th anniversary of China’s “Message to Compatriots in
Taiwan,” General Secretary Xi Jinping advocated a fivepoint proposal for managing relations with Taiwan,[126] stating
that “Our compatriots in Taiwan will not be absent from
the process as the Chinese people head toward our great
rejuvenation” and “The specific form of the ‘one country,
two systems’ model in Taiwan will give full consideration

1 Relations with China


China upholds the principle that Taiwan is a part of China,
and that the Taiwan issue is therefore a domestic one.
China maintains that the “one-China” principle is the
underlying premise and foundation for dialogue between
China and Taiwan. China also claims that it would never
abandon its efforts for peaceful unification, and expresses
that it would take up policies and measures to solve issues
of Taiwanese people’s interest and to protect their due
authority. Meanwhile, China is strongly opposed to any
foreign intervention in the unification of China as well as
any move towards the independence of Taiwan, and on this
basis, China has repeatedly stated that it has not renounced
the use of force.[119] “The Anti-Secession Law,” enacted in
March 2005, also clearly lays out the nonrenunciation of the
use of force by China.[120]

In her inaugural address upon taking office in May 2016,
President Tsai Ing-wen of the Democratic Progressive Party
did not outline a clear stance regarding the “1992 Consensus,”
which China positions as the political foundation of crossStrait relations and which exemplifies the “One China”
policy.[121] China responded by criticizing the speech as an
“incomplete test paper” and announced that it had already
suspended exchanges with Taiwan.[122] Also, before and after
the inauguration of President Tsai, Taiwanese delegates
were refused attendance to or had their invitations deferred
to meetings held by international organizations.[123] Since the
inauguration of the Tsai administration, five countries severed
diplomatic relations with Taiwan, while they established
relations with China.[124] Taiwan is strongly protesting these


**Chapter**


119 At the January 2019 event to commemorate the 40th anniversary of the Message to Compatriots in Taiwan, General Secretary Xi Jinping said, “We make no promise to renounce
the use of force.”

120 The law stipulates, “[in] the event that the ‘Taiwan independence’ secessionist forces should act under any name or by any means to cause the fact of Taiwan’s secession from
China, or that major incidents entailing Taiwan’s secession from China should occur, or that possibilities for a peaceful reunification should be completely exhausted, the state shall employ
non-peaceful means and other necessary measures to protect China’s sovereignty and territorial integrity.”

121 In May 2016, President Tsai said in her inaugural address that she “respect[s] this historical fact,” referring to the fact that China and Taiwan had, in 1992, “arrived at various joint
acknowledgements and understandings” through communication and negotiations. However, in January 2019, responding to General Secretary Xi’s major speech at the event
commemorating the 40th anniversary of the Message to Compatriots in Taiwan, President Tsai explained Taiwan’s position, stating, “we have never accepted the ‘1992 Consensus.’”

122 In June 2016, a Taiwan Affairs Office of the Chinese State Council spokesperson announced that the exchange mechanism had already been suspended since May 20.
123 Recently, Taiwan was unable to participate in the May 2019 World Health Organization (WHO) annual meeting for three consecutive years, which it had attended as an observer
since 2009. Taiwan claims that this was due to Chinese lobbying. According to an announcement by Taiwan’s Ministry of Foreign Affairs, after a request from China, Nigeria forcibly closed
Taiwan’s mission in July 2017, and the governments of Ecuador, Bahrain, Papua New Guinea, Jordan and other countries asked Taiwan to remove “Republic of China” and “Taiwan” from
the name of its missions and replace it with “Taipei.”

124 In December 2016, São Tomé and Príncipe severed diplomatic relations with Taiwan, followed by Panama doing so in June 2017, the Dominican Republic and Burkina Faso in May
2018 and El Salvador in August 2018, while they established relations with China. Taiwan currently has diplomatic relations with 17 countries.

125 In February 2018, the Taiwan Affairs Office of the Chinese State Council announced 31 preferential treatment measures including enrollment in schools and support of employment
from Taiwan. That September, the Chinese government began issuing residence cards to residents of Taiwan who have resided in mainland China for at least six months. The card
reportedly makes enrolling in social insurance, using public facilities, and accessing financial services more convenient for the holder.

126 At the commemorative event, General Secretary Xi advocated the following principles: (1) working together to realize reunification; (2) exploring a “one country, two systems”
approach suitable for Taiwan; (3) insisting on the “one China” principle; (4) deepening cross-Strait development with a view to reunification; and (5) fostering a common spirit among the

to the situation in Taiwan, and declared that the political
discrepancy between China and Taiwan “must not be passed
down for generations to come.” On the same day, President
Tsai responded with a statement firmly rejecting the “one
country, two systems” model and called for negotiations
between “government-authorized agencies.”
However, President Tsai resigned as chair of the
Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) after the ruling party was
defeated in the combined local elections held in November
2018. Per the election, attention focused on the victory of
Kuomintang candidate Han Kuo-yu in the mayoral election
for the southern Taiwanese city of Kaohsiung, which the DPP
had consistently won for the previous 20 years. Han stood
on a platform of improved relations with China to promote
regional economic revitalization. Initiatives associated with
the Xi administration’s policy on Taiwan and the direction of
Sino-Taiwanese relations will be a focus of attention ahead
of the next presidential election in 2020.
Both China and Taiwan have put forth their own assertions
regarding the Senkaku Islands, but Taiwan has a negative
attitude toward cooperating with China.[127]

2 Military Capabilities of Taiwan


Under President Tsai Ing-wen, Taiwan has put forth a vision
such as: a military strategy of “resolute defense, multidomain
deterrence;” “Cultivation of a Professional Military;”
and “Strengthening of information, communications,
and electronic warfare capabilities.” In December 2017,
Taiwan published its first national defense report under the
Tsai administration. The report changed the existing force
concept from “victory on beach areas,” to “preservation
of warfighting capability, pursuing decisive victory in the
littoral area, and annihilating the enemy in the beach area,”
and made its first mention of military cooperation with the
United States and insisted that their cooperation made a
progress both qualitatively and quantitatively. The United
States has started to approve the sale of weapons to Taiwan
in accordance with the Taiwan Relations Act[128] and the Asia
Reassurance Initiative Act, which was signed into law in
December 2018, mentions regular arms sales to Taiwan and


the encouragement of visits to Taiwan by high-level U.S.
government officials.
Aside from the purchases from the United States,
Taiwan is moving forward with the development of its own
equipment, and the Quadrennial Defense Review (2017
QDR) published in March 2017 emphasizes Taiwan’s
willingness to promote the development of the defense
industry, especially indigenous production of weapons and
equipment. For example, in June 2016, the Taiwan Navy
announced a policy to switch over major ships, including
submarines, to an indigenous shipbuilding program.
Taiwan adopted conscription in 1951, but it has been
switching to a volunteer system to improve the expertise
of its military personnel, among other objectives, and the
last of the conscripts were enlisted before the end of 2018.
However, the obligation to undergo four months of military
training is being maintained and Taiwan’s Ministry of
Defense describes the Taiwanese system of military service
as a dual-track mix of conscripts and volunteers. [129]

With regard to Taiwan’s military power, at present,
ground forces, including the Navy Marine Corps, have a
total of approximately 93,000 personnel. Other than this, it is
believed that approximately 1.66 million reserve personnel
of the air, naval, and ground forces would be available
in case of war. Regarding naval capabilities, in addition
to Kidd-class destroyers which were imported from the
United States, Taiwan possesses the indigenously built “Tuo
Chiang” stealth corvette, among other vessels. Regarding air
capabilities, Taiwan possesses F-16 A/B fighters,[130] Mirage

**KEY WORD**


Message to Compatriots in Taiwan

These open letters to Taiwan published by the Chinese side (such as the
Chinese Ministry of National Defense and the Standing Committee of the
National People’s Congress) are regarded as Chinese policy documents on
Taiwan. Five of these letters have been published to date (one in 1950, three
in 1958, and one in 1979); and as the one published by the Standing
Committee of the National People’s Congress in 1979 included references to
ending the cross-Strait military confrontation and expanding exchanges
between China and Taiwan, it is described as the document in which China
changed its Taiwan policy from armed liberation to peaceful unification.


**Chapter**


127 Taiwanese vessels intruded Japan’s territorial waters around the Senkaku Islands three times in 2012. Taiwan’s foreign minister issued a statement on the Senkaku Islands in
February 2013 titled “Our Position on Not Cooperating with Mainland China.”

128 The U.S. administration notified Congress in September 2018 that it intended to sell fighter aircraft parts and other arms worth approximately US$330 million (approximately 37.3
billion yen) to Taiwan; in April 2019, the administration notified Congress that it intended to sell fighter training programs and other arms worth approximately US$500 million
(approximately 55 billion yen); in July 2019, the administration notified Congress that it intended to sell M1A2T tanks and other arms worth approximately US$2.2 billion (approximately
242 billion yen); in August 2019, the administration notified Congress that it intended to sell F-16C/D Block70 and other arms worth approximately US$8 billion (approximately 880 billion
yen). This marks the fifth arms deal with Taiwan under the Trump administration, following on from the sale of arms in June 2017. In April 2018, the U.S. government reportedly gave U.S.
companies permission to engage in business talks with Taiwan about building submarines.

129 In February 2019, Taiwan’s Ministry of Defense issued a press release stating, “Reports that the conscription system will be ended are incorrect,” noting that a four-month period
of military training would continue to be imposed.

130 The Taiwan Air Force is moving forward with the upgrade of its F-16A/B fighters to F-16V fighters with enhanced radar performance, etc. It was reported that the first four aircraft

3 Military Balance between China and Taiwan


While China has continued to increase its defense budget by
a signifi cant margin, Taiwan’s defense budget has remained
mostly unchanged for nearly 20 years. China’s offi cial
military budget in 2018 was roughly 16 times the amount of
Taiwan’s.[131] Amid this situation, President Tsai has ordered
an increase in Taiwan’s defense budget.[132]

In the “National Defense Report 2017,” Taiwan
acknowledged rapid growth in China’s military capabilities
along with signifi cant advances in military reforms,
integrated operations, weapons development, and overseas
base construction and pointed out that “the military threat is
growing for Taiwan.” It also mentions that Chinese military
fi ghters and destroyers are active around the island, fl aunting
the country’s military capabilities to Taiwan.[133]

While the PLA proceeds to expand its missile, naval,
and air forces, it still remains to be the Taiwan military’s
challenge to modernize its equipment.


The military capabilities of China and Taiwan are
generally characterized as follows:
1) Regarding ground forces, while China possesses an
overwhelming number of troops, their capability of
landing and invading the island of Taiwan is limited at this
point in time.[134] However in recent years, China has been
steadily improving its landing and invasion capabilities,
such as building large amphibious ships.
2) Regarding naval and air forces, China, which overwhelms
Taiwan in terms of quantity, has also been rapidly
strengthening its naval and air forces in recent years in
terms of quality, where Taiwan used to have superiority
over China.[135]

3) Regarding missile attack capabilities, Taiwan has been
strengthening its ballistic missile defense, including
upgrading PAC-2 to PAC-3 and newly introducing PAC-3.
However, China possesses numerous short-range ballistic
missiles and other assets with ranges covering Taiwan.
Taiwan is deemed to lack effective countermeasures.
Comparison of military capabilities should be made based
not only on the performance and quality of the military

131 This figure was obtained by comparing China’s announced FY2018 defense budget of approximately 1,106.951 billion yuan and Taiwan’s announced FY2018 defense budget of
approximately 323.1 billion Taiwan dollars by converting them into U.S. dollars using the exchange rate for FY2018 released by the Central Bank of Taiwan (US$1 = 6.611 yuan = 30.156
Taiwan dollars). China’s actual defense budget is reportedly larger than the amount announced, and therefore, the actual difference in the defense budgets of China and Taiwan could be
greater.

132 At a ceremony held at the Navy Command Headquarters in August 2018, President Tsai highlighted the indigenous development of equipment and the improvement of defense
capability, before stating that she had ordered an increase in defense expenditure “to meet the needs of national security,” stressing that the budget increase is an expression of Taiwan’s
resolve in regard to national defense. In the 2016 general election, President Tsai made a commitment to increase defense expenditure to 3% of GDP.

133 Chinese military aircraft and naval vessels appeared not to have been active in the vicinity of Taiwan after late June 2018, but military aircraft activity around Taiwan reportedly
resumed from December that year. The Taiwanese military suggested that the temporary suspension of Chinese military activity around Taiwan was possibly due to the weather or
“verifi cation (by China) following the end of the phased training.”

134 In August 2018, it was reported that the unpublished annual report on China’s military power sent by the Taiwan Ministry of National Defense to the Legislative Yuan stated that the
Chinese military did not have the proper operational capabilities for a full-scale invasion of Taiwan, as it still lacked a means of transport for landing and logistical support capabilities.

135 China has 988 fourth and fifth-generation fighters, whereas Taiwan has325. In addition, China has 78 destroyers and frigates and 64 submarines, whereas Taiwan has 24 and 4,

the purpose and aspects of the assumed military operations,
the operational arrangements, the skill level of the personnel,
and the logistics. Nevertheless, the overall military balance
between China and Taiwan is shifting in favor of China, and
the gap appears to be growing year by year. Going forward,
attention is to be paid to trends such as the strengthening of


Chinese and Taiwanese forces, the sale of weapons to Taiwan
by the United States, and Taiwan’s development of its own
main military equipment.

his policy of concentrating on economic development.
In addition, at the Supreme People’s Assembly in April
2019, Chairman Kim expressed his intention to continue to
concentrate on economic development. Moreover, he stated
at the same assembly that the national defense capabilities
will constantly be improved, indicating that North Korea
will continue to make efforts to maintain and enhance its
military capabilities and combat readiness under “the new
strategic line”.[4] According to the official announcement at
the Supreme People’s Assembly in April 2019, the proportion
of the defense budget in the FY2019 national budget was
15.8%. However, it is believed that this represents only a
fraction of the real defense expenditures.
Furthermore, North Korea has continued to promote
the development of weapons of mass destruction (WMDs)
and ballistic missiles and the enhancement of its operation
capabilities, including by conducting six nuclear tests so
far and repeatedly launching ballistic missiles in recent
years at an unprecedented frequency. In addition, North
Korea is assessed to possess large-scale cyber units as part
of its asymmetric military capabilities, engaging in theft of
military secrets and developing capabilities to attack critical
infrastructure of foreign countries. It also retains largescale special operation forces. In addition, North Korea has
repeatedly used provocative rhetoric and behavior against

Ballistic missiles

A ballistic missile is a rocket engine-propelled missile that flies on a parabolic
trajectory. It is capable of attacking distant targets. Ballistic missiles are
generally categorized according to the following table.


1 General Situation


North Korea has been advocating the building of a strong
socialist state in all areas—ideology, politics, military affairs,
and economy,[1] and it adopts “military-first (Songun) politics”
to realize this goal. “Military-first (Songun) politics” has
been defined as a basic form of socialist politics that leads the
great undertaking of socialism to victory by giving priority
to the military forces in all activities under the principle of
military first, and strengthening and relying on the actors in
the revolution with the Korean People’s Army (KPA) acting
as the central and main force.[2] In fact, leader Kim Jongun, Chairman of the State Affairs Commission,[3] who is in
a position to control the military, noted: “It is necessary to
uphold the military-first revolutionary path as the constant
strategic path.” In addition, at the Plenary Meeting of the
Central Committee of the Korean Workers’ Party (KWP) in
March 2013, Chairman Kim Jong-un adopted the “Byungjin
line” policy of simultaneous economic and nuclear
development, asserting that even if North Korea does not
increase defense spending, it would be able to concentrate
on its economic development and on improving the people’s
livelihood while increasing the effectiveness of its war
deterrent and defense force as long as nuclear deterrence is
robust. At the Seventh KWP Congress in May 2016, he made
it clear that he would uphold the “Byungjin line” as well as
the “Songun politics.”
On the other hand, it is said that Chairman Kim Jong-un
is giving the party the central role in running the state, as
evidenced by the fact that he convened the KWP Congress in
May 2016 for the first time in 36 years. Furthermore, at the
Plenary Meeting of the Central Committee of the KWP in
April 2018, Chairman Kim declared that the “Byungjin line”
had been successfully carried out as the development of the
state nuclear force had been completed. He also announced
that the KWP’s “new strategic line” was that the whole of
the party and the whole of the state will fully concentrate
efforts on the construction of a socialist economy, indicating

has a precision guidance system on its warhead necessary to attack aircraft
carriers and other vessels is called an anti-ship ballistic missile (ASBM).


North Korea used to insist that it would open the door to a “powerful and prosperous nation (Kangseong Daeguk)” in 2012, which marked the 100th anniversary of the birth of the late
President Kim Il-sung. Recently, however, North Korea has been using mainly the expression, “powerful and prosperous country (Kangseong Kukka).”

purposes “Chairman of the State Affairs Commission” is used for the title of Kim Jong-un in this white paper.

**Status of North Korea’s Denuclearization and Its Nuclear and Missile Capabilities**

North Korea has expressed the intention to work towards the complete denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula at the
U.S.-North Korea Summit Meeting in June 2018. It has announced the suspension of nuclear tests and test-firing of ICBMs,
and publicly destroyed the Punggye-ri nuclear test site, announced that it would take additional measures, including the
dismantlement of a missile launch pad and engine test stand in Tongchang-ri, and pledged to dismantle a nuclear facility in
Yongbyon in exchange for the United States’ partial lifting of sanctions.
However, the second U.S.-North Korea Summit Meeting in February 2019 ended without any agreement. North Korea
has not carried out the dismantlement of all weapons of mass destruction and ballistic missiles of all ranges in a complete,
verifiable, and irreversible manner . The suspension of nuclear tests and ICBM firings and the open destruction of the nuclear
test site do not change the existing nuclear and ballistic missile capabilities that North Korea acquired through repeated
nuclear tests and missile launches. In other words, it remains that North Korea is assessed to have already successfully
miniaturized nuclear weapons to fit ballistic missile warheads, possesses and deploys several hundred ballistic missiles
capable of reaching every part of Japan and continues to possess capabilities for conducting surprise attacks against Japan
utilizing transporter-erector launchers and submarines and for simultaneous launches of several ballistic missiles and thus
there has been no essential change in North Korea’s nuclear and missile capabilities.
Meanwhile, North Korea has never mentioned the declaration or dismantlement of existing nuclear warheads, nuclear
materials, biological and chemical weapons, ballistic missiles for delivering weapons of mass destruction, or relevant
facilities. While it is pointed out that an uranium enrichment facility not disclosed exists in addition to the disclosed facility
in Yongbyon, North Korea has never mentioned the presence or dismantlement of such facilities.
Given these points, the Ministry of Defense and Self-Defense Forces will continue close watch on what kind of concrete
actions North Korea would take towards the dismantlement of weapons of mass destruction and missiles, as well as
collecting and analyzing necessary information and engaging in warnings and surveillance on North Korea’s military trends
in close cooperation with the United States and other countries.

relevant countries, including Japan.[5]

Such military trends in North Korea pose a grave and
imminent threat to the security of Japan and seriously
undermine the peace and security of the region and the
international community.
Needless to say, North Korea’s possession of nuclear
weapons cannot be tolerated. At the same time, sufficient
attention needs to be paid to the development and deployment


of ballistic missiles, the military confrontation on the Korean
Peninsula, and the proliferation of WMDs and ballistic
missiles by North Korea.
Partly because North Korea maintains its extremely
closed regime, it is difficult to accurately capture the details
and intentions of its behavior. However, it is necessary for
Japan to pay utmost attention to them.


For example, North Korea insisted “Japan will not be spared a merciless retaliatory attack by the North Korean forces” as a measure to “hold it totally accountable for all its vices” (July
2010). In addition, it stated that “not only Yokosuka, Misawa, Okinawa, and Guam but also the U.S. mainland are within our range” (March 31, 2013, Rodong Sinmun), “none of Japan’s
territories shall be spared from being the target of our retaliatory attack” (listing the names of Tokyo, Osaka, Yokohama, Nagoya, and Kyoto in this context) (May 29, 2009, Korean Central
News Agency; April 10, 2013, Rodong Sinmun), etc. More recently, the Korean Central Broadcasting Station stated on September 13, 2017, that, “the Japanese archipelago will be sunk into
the sea by a nuclear bomb,” and the October 9 edition of the Rodong Sinmun stated that, “If the flames of war break out on the Korean Peninsula, Japan can never be safe. Everything in

about 50 midget submarines, and about 140 air cushioned
landing crafts, the latter two of which are believed to be used
for infiltration and transportation of the special operations
forces.
The Air Force has approximately 550 combat aircraft,
most of which are out-of-date models made in China or the
former Soviet Union. However, some fourth-generation
aircraft such as MiG-29 fighters and Su-25 attack aircraft are
also included. North Korea has a large number of outdated
An-2 transport aircraft as well, which are believed to be used
for transportation of special operations forces.
In addition, North Korea has so-called asymmetric
military capabilities, namely, special operations force whose
size is estimated at 100,000 personnel.[8] In recent years, North
Korea is seen to be placing importance on and strengthening
its cyber forces.[9]

See Part I, Chapter 3, Section 3-2-3 (North Korea)


2 Military Posture


**(1) General Situation**

North Korea has been building up its military capabilities
in accordance with the Four Military Guidelines (extensive
training for all soldiers, modernizing all military forces,
arming the entire population, and fortifying the entire
country).[6]

North Korea’s military forces are comprised mainly of
ground forces, with a total troop strength of roughly 1.28
million. While North Korea’s military forces are believed to
have been maintaining and enhancing their capabilities and
operational readiness, most of its equipment is outdated.
Meanwhile, North Korea has forces such as large-scale
special operations force that can conduct various operations
ranging from intelligence gathering and sabotage, to guerrilla
warfare. Moreover, North Korea seems to have many
underground military related installations across its territory.

**(2) Military Capabilities**

The North Korean Army comprises about 1.10 million
personnel, and roughly two-thirds of them are believed to
be deployed along the DMZ. The main body of the army
is infantry, but the army also maintains armored forces
including at least 3,500 tanks and artillery. North Korea is
believed to regularly deploy long-range artillery along the
DMZ, such as 240 mm multiple rocket launchers and 170
mm self-propelled guns, which can reach cities and bases
in the northern part of the ROK including the capital city
of Seoul. Despite limited resources, it is deemed that North
Korea continues to selectively reinforce its conventional
forces and improve its equipment, such as main battle tanks
and multiple rocket launchers.[7]

The Navy has about 780 ships with a total displacement
of approximately 111,000 tons and is chiefly comprised of
small naval vessels such as high-speed missile craft. Also, it
has about 20 of the former model Romeo-class submarines,

3 WMD and Ballistic Missiles


While North Korea continues to maintain largescale military
capabilities, its conventional forces are considerably inferior
to those of the ROK and the U.S. Forces Korea. This is the
result of a variety of factors, including decreases in military
assistance from the former Soviet Union due to the collapse
of the Cold War regime, limitations placed on North Korea’s
national defense spending due to its economic stagnation, and
the rapid modernization of the ROK’s defense capabilities.
It is thus speculated that North Korea is focusing its efforts
on WMD and ballistic missile reinforcements in order to
compensate for this shortfall.
In recent years, North Korea has launched ballistic
missiles at an unprecedented frequency, rapidly improving
its operational capabilities, such as simultaneous launch and
surprise attack. In addition, given the technological maturity


The Four Military Guidelines were adopted at the fifth plenary meeting of the fourth KWP Central Committee in 1962.

North Korea reportedly continues to develop and produce modified tanks, such as the Pokpung-ho, the Ch’onma-ho and the Songun. (Furthermore, the Defense White Paper 2014 that the
ROK Ministry of National Defense released in January 2015 refers to North Korea’s development of a new 300 mm multiple rocket launcher, as well as the significant increase in the
number of tanks, armored cars, and multiple rocket launchers in North Korea’s possession. Furthermore, the Defense White Paper 2018 pointed out additional production of a new type of
tanks and the development of special shells, including precision-guided shells, by North Korea. North Korea allegedly fired several rounds from the 300 mm multiple rocket launcher on
three instances in March 2016 and launched a new short-range surface-to-air missile in April 2016. In addition, North Korea announced that it had successfully conducted test launches of
a new type of surface-to-air missiles and a new type of surface-to-ship cruise missiles on May 28 and June 9, 2017, respectively.

It had been said that North Korea possessed two types of special operations forces: one under the military forces and the other under the KWP. However, it has been reported that these
organizations were consolidated in 2009 and the Reconnaissance General Bureau was established under the auspices of the military forces. The existence of the bureau was officially
confirmed in March 2013 when Korean Central Broadcasting Station reported General Kim Yong-chol as the Director of the Reconnaissance General Bureau. Moreover, James Thurman,
then Commander of the U.S. Forces Korea, stated, “North Korea possesses the world’s largest special operations force of over 60,000” in his speech at the Association of U.S. Army in
October 2012. Additionally, the ROK Defense White Paper 2018 notes, “Special operation forces are currently estimated at approximately 200,000 strong.” The white paper pointed out that
North Korea’s special operations force has become an independent military branch.

The U.S. Director of National Intelligence’s “Worldwide Threat Assessment” of February 2016 notes, “North Korea probably remains capable and willing to launch disruptive or destructive
cyber attacks to support its political objectives.” The U.S. Department of Defense’s annual report “Military and Security Developments Involving the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea,”
released in May 2018, states, “North Korea probably views cyber operations as an appealing, cost-effective, and deniable means by which to collect intelligence and cause disruption
against its highly networked adversaries, notably the ROK, Japan, and the United States.” According to the ROK’s Defense White Paper 2018, North Korea is operating approximately 6,800
cyber warfare personnel and is continuing efforts to strengthen cyber warfare capability, including training of personnel with expert skills. Regarding North Korean cyber attacks, see

obtained through a series of nuclear tests, North Korea is
assessed to have already miniaturized nuclear weapons to fit
ballistic missile warheads.
These military trends in North Korea, coupled with its
provocative rhetoric and behavior, such as suggesting a
missile attack on Japan, and North Korea’s development
of WMDs and missiles pose a grave and imminent threat
to the security of Japan and seriously undermine the peace
and security of the region and the international community.
Additionally, such development poses a serious challenge to
the entire international community with regard to the nonproliferation of weapons, including WMDs.
On the other hand, at the Plenary Meeting of the Central
Committee of the KWP held on April 20, 2018, decisions
were made to discontinue “nuclear test and inter-continental
ballistic rocket test-fire,” and to dismantle the northern
nuclear test ground. In the subsequent inter-Korean summit
meeting held on April 27 and in the U.S.-North Korea
summit meeting held on June 12, North Korea expressed
its intention to work towards denuclearization. Then, on
May 24, international press representatives were invited to
witness the destruction of the northern nuclear test ground.
However, as North Korea has not carried out the
dismantlement of all weapons of mass destruction and
ballistic missiles of all ranges in a complete, verifiable, and
irreversible manner, there has been no essential change in
North Korea’s nuclear and missile capabilities.
Looking to the future, it will be necessary to continue to
carefully monitor moves by North Korea, including what kind
of concrete actions it will take towards the dismantlement of
all weapons of mass destruction and ballistic missiles of all
ranges in a complete, verifiable and irreversible manner.

**(1) Nuclear Weapons**

**a. The Current Status of the Nuclear Weapons Program**
Details of the current status of North Korea’s nuclear weapons
program are largely unclear, partly because North Korea
remains an extremely closed regime. In light of the unclear
status of past nuclear developments, and considering North
Korea has already conducted six nuclear tests including the


nuclear test in September 2017, it is conceivable that North
Korea has made considerable progress in its nuclear weapons
program.

With regard to plutonium, a fissile material that can be
used for nuclear weapons,[10] North Korea has suggested its
production and extraction on several instances.[11] As for recent
activities, in September 2015, North Korea announced that all
nuclear facilities in Yongbyon, including the nuclear reactor
and the reprocessing facility, the disablement of which was
agreed upon at the fifth and the sixth round of the Six-Party
Talks in February and September 2007, respectively, had
been readjusted and had started normal operation.[12] Because
the restarting of the reactor could lead to the production and
extraction of plutonium by North Korea, those activities are
causes of great concern.
As for highly enriched uranium that can also be used
for nuclear weapons, in June 2009, North Korea declared
the commencement of uranium enrichment. In November
2010, North Korea disclosed its uranium enrichment facility
to American nuclear specialists and later announced that it
was operating a uranium enrichment plant equipped with
thousands of centrifuges. The expansion of this uranium
enrichment plant has been suggested in August 2013; in this
regard, North Korea could have increased its enrichment
capabilities. The series of North Korean behaviors related
to uranium enrichment indicate the possibility of the
development of nuclear weapons using highly enriched
uranium in addition to plutonium.[13]

Regarding these nuclear-related activities, activities that
are inconsistent with a “commitment to work toward complete

denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula,” which North
Korea insists it upholds, have been pointed out. For example,
U.S. Secretary of State Pompeio testified in the Senate in
July 2018 that North Korea was continuing to produce
nuclear fuels. In addition, at a meeting of the International
Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) Board of Governors, IAEA
Director General Amano pointed out in March 2019 that the
IAEA continued to observe signs of North Korea using the
enrichment facility at nuclear facilities in Yongbyon.


**Chapter**


10 Plutonium is synthetically produced in a nuclear reactor by irradiating uranium with neutrons, and then extracting it from used nuclear fuel at a reprocessing facility. Plutonium is then used
as a basic material for the production of nuclear weapons. Meanwhile, in order to use uranium for nuclear weapons, it is necessary to extract uranium 235 (U235), a highly fissile material,
from natural uranium. This process is called enrichment. Generally, a large-scale enrichment facility that combines thousands of centrifuges is used to boost the U235 concentration to
nuclear weapon levels (over 90%).

11 North Korea announced in October 2003 that it had completed the reprocessing of 8,000 used fuel rods that contain plutonium, and in May 2005 that it had completed extraction of an
additional 8,000 used fuel rods. The ROK’s Defense White Paper 2018 estimates that North Korea possesses around 50 kg of plutonium, retaining the assessment given in the Defense
White Paper 2016.

12 The “Worldwide Threat Assessment” of the U.S. Director of National Intelligence of January 2016 notes, “North Korea has followed through on its announcement by expanding the size of
its Yongbyon enrichment facility and restarting the reactor that was previously used for plutonium production.” It is said that the reactor was restarted at the end of August 2013. It has
been noted that if the reactor is restarted, North Korea would have the capability to produce enough plutonium (approximately 6 kg) to manufacture approximately one nuclear bomb in one
year.

13 The ROK Defense White Paper 2018 assesses that North Korea possesses a substantial amount of highly enriched uranium (HEU). It has been noted that a uranium enrichment facility

With regard to the development of nuclear weapons, North
Korea has conducted nuclear tests in October 2006,[14] May
2009,[15] February 2013,[16] January 2016,[17] September 2016,[18]
and September 2017.[19] It is highly likely that North Korea
has made strides in its nuclear weapons program, collecting
the necessary data through these nuclear tests.
It is believed that North Korea seeks to miniaturize
nuclear weapons and develop them into warheads that can be
mounted on ballistic missiles, as part of its nuclear weapons
program. On September 3, 2017, it was announced that
Chairman Kim Jong-un had visited North Korea’s Nuclear
Weapons Institute and had seen a hydrogen bomb capable
of being loaded into an ICBM,[20] in addition to which,
following North Korea’s sixth nuclear test that was forced
through on the same day, North Korea announced that it
“successfully carried out a test of H-bomb for ICBM.” In
general, miniaturizing a nuclear weapon small enough to be
mounted on a ballistic missile requires a considerably high
degree of technological capacity. However, considering, for
example, that the United States, the former Soviet Union,
the United Kingdom, France, and China succeeded in
acquiring such technology by as early as the 1960s, as well
as the technological maturity that is estimated to have been
reached through North Korea’s previous six nuclear tests, it
is assessed that North Korea has already miniaturized nuclear
weapons to fit ballistic missile warheads.[21]

Furthermore, the yield of the sixth nuclear weapons test in
2017 was estimated to be the largest ever, with a maximum
yield of approximately 160 kt. Given the size of the estimated
yield, the possibility cannot be discounted that the test was of


Object claimed to be a hydrogen bomb capable of being loaded into an ICBM [Korean
News Service/Jiji]

a hydrogen bomb.[22]

In any case, related developments need to be monitored
carefully. North Korea’s nuclear weapons development,
considered in conjunction with North Korean efforts to
enhance ballistic missile capabilities, including extending
the range of ballistic missiles that are the delivery vehicles of
WMDs, poses a serious and imminent threat to the security
of Japan, and seriously undermines peace and security of the
region and international community. Therefore, it can never
be tolerated.
**b. Background of the Nuclear Program**
As regards the objective of North Korea’s nuclear
development, North Korea is deemed to be developing
nuclear weapons as an indispensable deterrent for maintaining
the existing regime in light of the following: North Korea’s
ultimate goal is allegedly the maintenance of the existing


**Chapter**


14 On October 27, 2006, as a result of the independently collected information and its analysis as well as Japan’s own careful examination of the U.S. and ROK analyses, the Japanese
Government arrived at the judgment that the probability of North Korea conducting a nuclear test was extremely high.

15 The Japanese Government believes that North Korea conducted a nuclear test on this day, given that North Korea announced on May 25, 2009, via the Korean Central News Agency, that it
had successfully conducted an underground nuclear test, and in light of the Japan Meteorological Agency’s detection of seismic waves with a waveform that were unlikely those of a
natural earthquake.

16 On February 12, 2013 at around 11:59 am, the Japan Meteorological Agency detected seismic waves with an epicenter located in the vicinity of North Korea, which had waveforms that
were unlikely those of a natural earthquake. On the same day, North Korea announced via the Korean Central News Agency that it successfully conducted a nuclear test. On this basis, the
Government of Japan verified the facts in coordination with other relevant parties, including the United States and the ROK. Based on a comprehensive consideration of the aforementioned
information, the Japanese Government determined that North Korea conducted a nuclear test. North Korea announced that it “succeeded in the third underground nuclear test,” “the test
was conducted in a safe and perfect way on a high level with the use of a smaller and light A-bomb, unlike the previous ones, yet with great explosive power,” “physically demonstrating
the good performance of the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea (DPRK)’s nuclear deterrence that has become diversified.”

17 On January 6, 2016 at around 10:30 am, the Japan Meteorological Agency detected seismic waves with an epicenter located in the vicinity of North Korea, which had waveforms that were
unlikely those of a natural earthquake. On the same day, North Korea announced via the Korean Central News Agency that it successfully conducted a hydrogen bomb test. Based on a
comprehensive consideration of this and other information, the Japanese Government determined that North Korea conducted a nuclear test.

18 On September 9, 2016 at approximately 9:30 a.m., the Japan Meteorological Agency detected seismic waves with an epicenter located in the vicinity of North Korea, which had waveforms
that were unlikely those of a natural earthquake. Based on a comprehensive consideration of all the information including this, the Government believes that North Korea conducted a
nuclear test.

19 At around 12:31 p.m. on September 3, 2017, the Japan Meteorological Agency (JMA) detected seismic waves with an epicenter located in the vicinity of North Korea, which had waveforms
that were unlikely those of a natural earthquake. Based on comprehensive considerations, including the information from the JMA, the Government determined that the earthquake
occurred as a result of a nuclear test by North Korea.

20 On September 3, 2017, in a report on a visit by Chairman Kim Jong-un to North Korea’s Nuclear Weapons Institute, the Korean Central News Agency (KCNA) announced that North Korea is
able to conduct an “ultra-powerful electromagnetic pulse (EMP) attack over a wide area.”

21 Over ten years have already passed since North Korea conducted its first nuclear test in October 2006. Furthermore, North Korea has conducted six nuclear tests to date. This timetable for
technology development and the number of tests are reaching levels that are by no means inadequate, even when compared to the processes of developing technologies to miniaturize
and lighten nuclear weapons in the United States, former Soviet Union, the United Kingdom, France, and China. The ROK’s Defense White Paper 2018 assesses that “North Korea’s ability to
miniaturize nuclear weapons seems to have reached a considerable level.”

22 The ROK’s Defense White Paper 2018 noted that the explosive yield of the sixth nuclear test was approximately 50 kt, significantly larger than the yield of the past tests and that this was
assessed to be a hydrogen bomb test. North Korea also insisted that its fourth nuclear test, conducted in January 2016, was a hydrogen bomb test. However, given that the yield of that test

regime;[23] North Korea considers that it needs its own nuclear
deterrence to counter the nuclear threat of the United States[24]
and is in no position at least in the short-term to overturn its
inferiority in conventional forces vis-à-vis the United States
and the ROK; North Korea asserts that the Iraqi and Libyan
regimes collapsed and that Syria was attacked by U.S. Forces
in April 2017 due to their lack of nuclear deterrence;[25] and
North Korea has reiterated that nuclear weapons will never
be traded away at negotiations.
In fact, North Korea has repeatedly claimed to the
international community that it was a “nuclear weapons
state.”[26] In March 2013, North Korea adopted the “new
strategic line” (so-called “Byungjin line”) policy of
simultaneous economic and nuclear development. At
the Seventh KWP Congress and also in the “New Year’s
Address” of January 2018, it made clear that it would
remain steadfast to this policy. At the Plenary Meeting of the
Central Committee of the KWP in April 2018, in addition
to declaring the “Byungjin line” was successfully carried
out, North Korea declared that among other things, it had
determined to “concentrate all efforts on building a powerful
socialist economy and markedly improving the standard of
people’s living through the mobilization of all human and
material resources of the country.”
With regard to the issue of North Korea’s development of
nuclear weapons, recently, at the first-ever U.S.-North Korea
summit meeting held on June 12, 2018, Chairman Kim Jongun made clear his intention to work towards the complete
denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula, and confirmed
that negotiations would continue with the United States.
Furthermore, in Pyongyang Joint Declaration of September
2018 that was agreed upon at the inter-Korean summit on
September 19, 2018, North Korea expressed its intention to


permanently close the nuclear facilities in Yongbyon if the
United States takes corresponding measures. In addition,
in his “New Year’s Address” in 2019, Chairman Kim Jongun expressed his intention to neither make and test nuclear
weapons any longer nor use and proliferate them.[27] However,
Chairman Kim is presumed to have done so on the premise
that North Korea would continue to possess a nuclear
arsenal. Moreover, North Korea has repeatedly insisted that
it will not agree to unilateral denuclearization. In addition, it
has been noted that even after announcing a commitment to
full denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula, North Korea
has continued nuclear development[28] and that a uranium
enrichment facility not disclosed by North Korea exists.
In light of the above, it is now necessary to keep a close
watch on what kind of concrete actions it will take towards
the dismantlement of all weapons of mass destruction and all
ballistic missiles of all ranges in a complete, verifiable and
irreversible manner.

**(2) Biological and Chemical Weapons**

North Korea is an extremely closed regime. In addition, most
materials, equipment, and technology used for manufacturing
biological and chemical weapons are for both military and
civilian uses, which in turn facilitates camouflage. For these
reasons, details of the status of North Korea’s biological and
chemical weapons development and arsenals are unclear.
However, with regard to chemical weapons, North Korea
is suspected to have several facilities capable of producing
chemical agents and already a substantial stockpile of
such agents. North Korea is also thought to have some
infrastructure for the production of biological weapons.[29]

Possession of sarin, VX, mustard and other chemical
weapons, and of anthrax, smallpox, pest and other biological
agents that could be used as biological weapons have been

23 U.S. DoD’s “Military and Security Developments Involving the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea,” February 2016.
24 For example, a statement issued by the National Defense Commission of the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea on March 14, 2014, alleges that the United States threatens and
intimidates North Korea with nuclear strikes, and that North Korea has come to possess nuclear deterrence out of necessity in order to protect the autonomy of its nation and people.

25 For example, a comment in the Rodong Sinmun dated December 2, 2013, contends that the situation in Iraq and Libya teaches an acute lesson that countries under the constant threat of U.S.
preemptive nuclear attack have no choice but to become a victim of U.S. state terrorism, unless the countries have powerful deterrent capability. In addition, the “Statement by the
Spokesperson of the Foreign Ministry of the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea” dated April 8, 2017, states with regard to the U.S. attack on Syria two days earlier on April 6 as follows:
“Swaggering as a superpower, the US has been picking only on countries without nuclear weapons and the Trump administration is no exception.”

26 North Korea announced in 2005 that it manufactured nuclear weapons, and declared itself a “nuclear weapons state” in 2012 in its revised constitution. In April 2013, after conducting its
third nuclear test in February, North Korea adopted the Law on Consolidating the Position of Self-Defensive Nuclear Weapons State. During the Seventh KWP Congress held in May 2016,
KWP Chairman Kim Jong-un delivered a report on the work of the KWP Central Committee, setting out that North Korea was a “nuclear weapons state,” and stating, “We will consistently
take hold on the strategic line of simultaneously pushing forward the economic construction and the building of nuclear force and boost self-defensive nuclear force both in quality and
quantity.”

27 It has been noted that this argument is based on the premise that North Korea will continue to own nuclear weapons for the moment.
28 For example, the National Threat Assessment, released by the U.S. Director of National Intelligence in January 2019, pointed out as follows: “We continue to observe activity inconsistent
with full denuclearization.” In addition, the final report of the UN Security Council’s Panel of Experts assisting the North Korea Sanctions Committee, released in March 2019, pointed out
that nuclear facilities in Yongbyon were continuing to operate.

29 For example, the ROK Defense White Paper 2018 points out that, following the commencement of production in the 1980s, it is estimated that North Korea has a stock of 2,500-5,000 tons
of various chemical weapons stored. It also notes that North Korea likely has the capability to produce a variety of biological weapons including anthrax, smallpox, and pests. Moreover, the
U.S. DoD’s “Military and Security Developments Involving the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea” of May 2018 points out that, “North Korea probably could employ CW [chemical
weapons] agents by modifying a variety of conventional munitions, including artillery and ballistic missiles.” North Korea ratified the Biological Weapons Convention in 1987 but has not

pointed out.[30]

The possibility cannot be denied that North Korea is able
to load biological and/or chemical weapons on warheads.

**(3) Ballistic Missiles**

As is the case with WMDs, many of the details of North
Korea’s ballistic missiles are unknown, partly owing to the
country’s extremely closed regime. It appears, however, that
North Korea gives high priority to the development of ballistic
missiles out of political and diplomatic considerations and
from the viewpoint of earning foreign currency,[31] in addition
to enhancing its military capabilities. The ballistic missiles
currently deemed to be possessed and developed by North
Korea are the following.[32]


Japan falls within this range.
In addition, North Korea is developing a ballistic missile
that appears to be an improvement of the Scud missile.
This ballistic missile was launched on May 29, 2017, and
is presumed to have flown approximately 400 km and fallen
into Japan’s exclusive economic zone (EEZ). A day after
the launch, North Korea announced that it had successfully
conducted a test launch of a newly developed ballistic rocket
incorporating a precision navigation guidance system. In
addition, while the images released by North Korea show
that the ballistic missile was launched from a continuous
track TEL and had what appears to be small wings[34] on its

**KEY WORD**


Transporter-Erector-Launcher (TEL)

The signs of a launch from a fixed launcher are easy for the adversary to
detect and are vulnerable to attack by the adversary. TEL was developed
mainly by the former Soviet Union among others in order to make the
detection of launch signs more difficult and increase survivability. According
to the U.S. DoD’s “Military and Security Developments Involving the
Democratic People’s Republic of Korea” of May 2018, North Korea possesses
a maximum of 100 TELs for Scuds, 50 TELs for Nodongs, and 50 TELs for
IRBMs (Musudans).
The type of TEL differs according to the length and weight of the ballistic
missile. The Scud, Nodong and Musudan are mounted on a four-, five-, and
six-axle wheel drive TEL respectively. The new type of intercontinental-range
ballistic missile launched on July 4 and 28, and the KN-08/14 are mounted
on an eight-axle wheel-drive TEL, and the intercontinental-range ballistic
missile believed to be a new type that was launched on November 29
appears to have been mounted and transferred on a nine-axle wheel-drive
TEL. The ballistic missile modified from the SLBM launched on February 12
and May 21, and the ballistic missile modified from the Scud missile
launched on May 29 of the same year appear to have been launched from a
continuous track TEL. Generally, a continuous track TEL is adapted to
operating on uneven ground but is not adapted to long distance
transportation compared to the wheel-drive TEL.
As for a TEL-mounted missile launch, it is deemed difficult to detect
individual specific signs in advance concerning the detailed location and
timing of the launch. This is because it is operated by being mounted and
transported on a TEL, and furthermore, military-related underground facilities
are thought to exist nationwide.
Along with activities related to the development of ballistic missiles,
developments related to the building of TELs require close watch as they
concern the operational capabilities of ballistic missiles by North Korea.

**a. Types of Ballistic Missiles Possessed or Developed by**
**North Korea**
**(a) Toksa**
Toksa is a short-range ballistic missile with a range estimated
to be approximately 120 km. It is mounted on a TEL. It is
deemed that Toksa is the first ballistic missile possessed
or developed by North Korea which adopts a solid fuel
propellant.[33]

**(b) Scud**
The Scud is a liquid fuel propellant single-stage ballistic
missile and is transported and operated on a TEL.
Scud B and Scud C, a variant of Scud B with extended
range, are short-range ballistic missiles with ranges estimated
to be about 300 km and 500 km, respectively. It is believed
that North Korea has manufactured and deployed them, and
has exported them to the Middle East and other countries.
The Scud ER (Extended Range) is a ballistic missile that
has an extended range due to the extension of the Scud’s
body as well as the reduction in weight of the warhead,
among other factors. The range of a Scud ER is estimated to
reach approximately 1,000 km, and it appears that a part of


30 In principle, the ballistic missile defense system is also used to handle ballistic missiles carrying biological or chemical weapons. With regard to the damage on the ground in the case
where a ballistic missile carrying a biological or chemical weapon is destroyed by a Patriot missile PAC-3, etc., there is no single answer to the question since the damage varies according
to the various conditions such as the type, performance, intercepted altitude and speed of the ballistic missile, and the weather. However, in general terms, the biological or chemical
weapon will likely be neutralized by the heat, etc. at the time of the destruction of the ballistic missile, and even if it retains its potency it will disperse during the freefall stage. Thus, it is
believed that the ballistic missile will be unable to demonstrate its prescribed effectiveness.

31 North Korea admitted that it is exporting ballistic missiles to earn foreign currency. (Comment by the Korean Central News Agency on June 16, 1998, and statement made by a North Korean
Foreign Ministry spokesperson on December 13, 2002) At the same time, it is pointed out that North Korea’s ballistic missile exports have been set back by increasing pressure from the
international community.

32 According to “Jane’s Sentinel Security Assessment China and Northeast Asia” (accessed in May 2018) North Korea possesses 700 to 1,000 ballistic missiles in total, 45% of which are
presumed to be Scud-class, 45% Nodong-class, and the remaining 10% other intermediate- and long-range ballistic missiles.

33 A small vehicle-mounted missile that was displayed in a military parade in February 2018 is said to be a new type of short-range ballistic missile propelled by solid fuel.

Although the details of Nodong s performance have
not been confirmed, Nodong may not have the accuracy to
carry out precise strikes on specific target installations, as
this ballistic missile is likely based on Scud technology.
However, it has been suggested that North Korea is working
to increase the Nodong’s accuracy. In this regard, it had been
suggested that there is a type of Nodong aimed at enhancing
accuracy by improving the shape of the warhead (whose
range is deemed to reach approximately 1,500 km through
the weight reduction of the warhead). Against this backdrop,
the launch of this type of ballistic missile was confirmed for
the first time in the images published by North Korea a day
after the launch of one Scud and two Nodong missiles on
July 19, 2016.
**(d) Submarine-Launched Ballistic Missile (SLBM)**
It has been suggested that North Korea is developing an
SLBM and a new submarine which is designed to carry
the SLBM (referred to by North Korea as “Pukguksong”).
Since it announced in May 2015 through its media that it
conducted a successful test launch of an SLBM, it has made
public SLBM launches on four occasions.[36] Judging from
the images and footage that it has made public so far, North
Korea may have succeeded in operating the “cold launch
system,” in which the missile is ignited after it is ejected into
the air. Moreover, in the launches in April and August 2016,
it appears, based on observations such as the shape of the
flame coming out of the missile and the color of the smoke,
that the militarily superior solid fuel propellant system was
adopted.[37]

A ballistic missile presumed to be an SLBM has been
confirmed in flight in the direction of Japan, launched from

the vicinity of Sinpo, on the east coast of North Korea, on
August 24, 2016. The SLBM flew approximately 500 km.
Considering that this was its first SLBM to fly approximately
500 km, the possibility cannot be denied that North Korea had
striven to solve the problems through the preceding launches
and achieved certain technological progress. Furthermore,
it is predicted that the ballistic missile presumed to be the
SLBM that was launched at this time flew on a somewhat
higher than nominal trajectory. If it were launched on a
nominal trajectory the firing range is expected to surpass
1,000 km.[38]

It is assessed that North Korea’s SLBMs are launched
from a Gorae-class submarine (displacement 1,500 tons).

warhead, i.e., characteristics different from those of existing
Scud missiles, the shape other than the warhead and length
are similar to existing Scud missiles. Another similarity is

that it can be confirmed that the missile has straight-line
exhausts characteristic of a liquid fuel-propelled engine. It
has also been noted that this ballistic missile is equipped with
a MaRV.[35] Given that North Korea announced that Chairman
Kim Jong-un had ordered the development of ballistic
missiles capable of precision attacks on enemy ships and
other individual targets, the intent appears to be to enhance
the accuracy of ballistic missile attacks.
**(c) Nodong**
The Nodong is a liquid fuel propelled single-stage ballistic
missile and is transported and operated on a TEL. It is
assessed to have a range of about 1,300 km, reaching almost
all of Japan.


35 For example, according to “Jane’s Sentinel Security Assessment China and Northeast Asia” (accessed in May 2018), the launch on May 29, 2017, was presumed to have been the first
launch of a short-range ballistic missile based on a Scud missile, equipped with a MaRV, suggesting that North Korea has made advances in its precision guidance systems.

36 On May 9, 2015, North Korea announced that it had succeeded in a test launch of an SLBM. On January 8, 2016, it released footage of an SLBM test launch that appears to be different
from the one unveiled in May 2015. On April 24 and August 25, 2016, it again announced that it had succeeded in SLBM test launches. Moreover, the Ministry of Defense (MOD) predicts
that North Korea also launched one ballistic missile presumed to be an SLBM on July 9, 2016, although North Korea has not made an announcement about the launches.

37 It has been pointed out that North Korea’s SLBM is an improved version of the former Soviet Union’s liquid fuel propelled SLBM “SS-N-6,” similar to the Musudan.
38 According to the Korean Central Broadcasting Station on August 25, 2016, North Korea announced that this test launch “was successfully conducted without any negative effects on the

**(f) Intermediate-Range Ballistic Missile (IRBM)**
To date North Korea has launched three liquid fuel-propelled
IRBMs (referred to by North Korea as “Hwasong-12”).
This ballistic missile was launched on May 14, 2017 and
is presumed to have reached a height of over 2,000 km
and flew a distance of approximately 800 km for about 30
minutes. Based on this flight pattern, it is presumed that the
ballistic missile was launched on a lofted trajectory. Had it
been launched on a nominal trajectory, the maximum firing
range is assessed to be close to approximately 5,000 km. In
addition, the straight-line exhausts characteristic of a liquid
fuel propelled engine can be confirmed from the images
released by North Korea a day after the launch, suggesting
that the ballistic missile uses liquid fuel. On August 29
and September 15, 2017, single missiles of this class were
launched and flew over Japan’s territory in the vicinity of
the Oshima Peninsula and Cape Erimo. The ballistic missile
launched on August 29 flew at an altitude of approximately
550 km over Japanese territory, and is presumed to have
flown a total distance of 2,700 km. The ballistic missile
launched on September 15 is presumed to have flown over
Japanese territory at an altitude of between 700 and 800 km,
flying for a total distance of approximately 3,700 km. These
launches were the first cases of North Korea launching what
it calls ballistic missiles that flew over Japan’s territory.
In view of their flight paths, these missiles appear to
demonstrate a certain level of function as an IRBM. Also,
the fact that missiles that overflew Japan were launched in
succession in a short time period would suggest that North
Korea is steadily improving its ballistic missile capabilities.
Furthermore, although at the time of launches in May and
August 2017 the missiles were confirmed to have been
launched after being separated from the wheel-drive TEL, at
the time of the September launch the missile was confirmed
to have been launched while still attached to the wheel-drive
TEL. Considering this point, together with North Korea’s
claims at the time of the launch that it was for the purposes of
“confirming practical operational procedures” and “realize
the potential of the ‘Hwasong-12’” there is a possibility
that North Korea is improving its practical operational
capabilities.
In 2016 North Korea conducted repeated launches of an
IRBM that is presumed to be the Musudan,[40] but although
the missile launched in June flew for a certain distance on
a lofted trajectory, the fact that there were two successive
launch failures in October would suggest that there may still


Image publicly released by North Korea when it launched a ballistic missile modified
from the SLBM (presumed) (February 2017) [AFP/Jiji]

North Korea has one such submarine. It is also pointed out
that North Korea seeks to develop a larger submarine to
launch SLBMs.[39]

It is deemed that through developing the SLBM and a new
submarine to carry it, North Korea intends to diversify its
ballistic missile attack capabilities and improve survivability.
**(e) Ballistic Missile Modified from the SLBM**
North Korea launched a ballistic missile on both February 12
and May 21, 2017, both of which appeared to be a modified
version of the SLBM for ground launch (referred to by North
Korea as “Pukguksong-2”). This ballistic missile is estimated
to have flown approximately 500 km on both occasions, on
somewhat higher trajectories than normal. If it were launched
on a nominal trajectory, the firing range is assessed to surpass
1,000 km. A day after the launch on February 12, North Korea
named the ballistic missile that was launched “Pukguksong-2”
and announced that it was developed as a ground-to-ground
ballistic missile based on the results of the August 2016
SLBM launch. It also announced a day after the launch on
May 21, 2017 that it had again successfully conducted the test
launch of the Pukguksong-2 and that Chairman Kim Jongun had authorized its “operational deployment.” Moreover,
the launch by a “cold launch system,” in which the missile
is ignited after it is ejected into the air from a continuous
track TEL, and the characteristic radial exhausts of solid
fuel propellant engines, can be confirmed from each of the
images that North Korea released. It has the characteristics
of appearing to be using “cold launch system” and solid
fuel propellant engines in common with the SLBM. Given
that North Korea has made references to its deployment
for operational deployment, there is a possibility that North
Korea will newly deploy a solid fuel propellant engine that
includes Japan within its firing range.

40 With a range of between 2,500 and 4,000 km, it has been suggested that all parts of Japan and Guam may fall within the Musudan’s firing range. Similar to its Scud and Nodong
counterparts, it is liquid fuel-propelled and is loaded onto a TEL to transport and operate. It has been noted that Musudan is a revamped version of the Russian SLBM SS-N-6 that North

system is conical; and (3) the straight-line flame of liquidpropulsion systems can be confirmed.
Based on these facts and the respective ranges that can
be estimated for the missiles, the possibility can be deduced
that the ICBM that were launched on July 4 and 28 were
developed on the basis of the new-type IRBM that had been
launched on May 14.
Also based on images published by North Korea, it can
be confirmed that the ballistic missiles that were launched on
July 4 and 28 had been mounted on the wheeled eight-axle
TEL similar to KN-08/14 (see (j) below). However, it can be
confirmed from the images at the time of the launches that
they were launched from simplified launch pads, not TELs.
Furthermore, the images suggest that the missile was of twostage construction.
**(h) New Type of Intercontinental-Range Ballistic Missile**
(Launched on November 29, 2017)
On November 29, 2017, North Korea launched a single
missile that is presumed to have been a new type of
intercontinental-range ballistic missile (referred to by North
Korea as “Hwasong-15”) different to the missiles described
in (g) above. The missile reached a height of well over 4,000
km, and is estimated to have flown approximately 53 minutes,
covering a distance of approximately 1,000 km before falling
into Japan’s EEZ. From this flight pattern it is presumed that
the missile was launched on a lofted trajectory. On the day of
the launch, North Korea made an “government statement,”
declaring that it had successfully conducted a test launch of
the “Hwasong-15,” a newly developed type of ICBM with
the capability to strike all areas of the U.S. mainland, and
asserting that it had now completed development of its state
nuclear force.
The following points would suggest that this missile
is a new type of intercontinental-range ballistic missile,
different from the two ICBM launched in July 2017: (1) its
flight distance and altitude; (2) the fact that North Korea
announced the successful test launch of a new type of ICBM,
the “Hwasong-15;” (3) the fact that the missile was deployed
on a previously unseen nine-axle wheel-drive TEL; and (4)
that the nose of the warhead was more rounded than previous
missiles. In addition, according to images released by North
Korea, the missile was of a two-stage design, and it can be
confirmed that it was removed from the TEL prior to launch
and that its straight-line exhausts are characteristic of a liquid
fuel propelled engine.
Furthermore, based on the flight altitude, distance flown
and released images, it can be assumed that this missile could
have a range in excess of 10,000 km, depending on the weight

be obstacles remaining towards the operationalization of the
Musudan and that North Korea may be concentrating on the
development and operationalization of the “Hwasong-12” as
an IRBM instead.
**(g) Intercontinental-Range Ballistic Missile (ICBM)**
(Launched on July 4 and 28, 2017)
To date North Korea has launched two intercontinentalrange ballistic missiles (ICBM) (referred to by North Korea
as “Hwasong-14”). One such ballistic missile was launched
on July 4, 2017, reaching a height well over 2,500 km, and
is estimated to have flown approximately 40 minutes. It flew
approximately 900 km and is estimated to have fallen into
Japan’s EEZ. Another missile that was launched on July 28
reached a height of well over 3,500 km, and is estimated to
have flown approximately 45 minutes, covering a distance
of approximately 1,000 km before falling into Japan’s EEZ.
From this flight pattern it is presumed that the two ballistic
missiles were launched on a lofted trajectory. If they were
to have been launched on a normal trajectory it is estimated
that they would have a maximum range of at least 5,500
km. On July 4, the day of the launch, North Korea made
an “important announcement,”[41] announcing that it had
successfully conducted a test launch of a new type of ICBM.
Furthermore, on the day following the July 28 launch, North
Korea announced that the “nuclear bomb detonation device”
had functioned normally, emphasizing that the safety of the
warhead in an atmospheric reentry environment had been
made maintained. This suggests that North Korea is aiming
to operationalize long-range ballistic missiles.
Based on images released by North Korea, the ballistic
missiles launched on July 4 and 28 have the following in
common with the IRBM launched on May 14: (1) the engine
system consists of one main engine and four auxiliary
engines; (2) the shape of the lower part of the propulsion

of the warhead deployed, etc., thus renewing concerns over
the increasing ranges of North Korea’s ballistic missiles.
In addition, although the wheel-drive TELs possessed by
North Korea are thought to be modified versions of Russian
and Chinese TELs, it is noteworthy that North Korea has
claimed to have developed its own TEL.
**(i) Taepodong-2**
Taepodong-2 are long-range ballistic missiles launched from
fixed launch pads.[42] Taepodong-2 is believed to use in its first
stage, four engines, each of which is developed based on
the technologies of Nodong, and the same type of engine in
its second stage. Its range is estimated to be approximately
6,000 km for the two-stage type, while the range of its
three-stage variant can be more than approximately 10,000
km assuming that the weight of the warhead is not over
approximately 1 ton. Taepodong-2 missiles and its variants
have been launched a total of five times so far.
Most recently, in February 2016, North Korea conducted
a launch of a missile disguised as a “satellite” from the
Tongch’ang-ri district in the northwest coastline of North
Korea using a Taepodong-2 variant, a type similar to that of
the previous ballistic missile launch in December 2012, after
notifying international organizations.[43] It is assessed that
North Korea’s long-range ballistic missiles’ technological
reliability had been advanced by this launch because it is
estimated that (1) it successfully launched two similar types
of ballistic missiles in a row; (2) the missile flew in almost


Image publicly released by North Korea when it launched an ICBM presumed to be a
new type (November 2017) [AFP/Jiji]

the same way as the last launch; and (3) it put an object into
orbit around the Earth.[44]

Accordingly, it is believed that these test launches of longrange ballistic missiles can contribute to the development
of shorter-range missiles in such ways as increasing the
range and payload capability and improving the circular
error probability (CEP). Also, related technology such as
the separation technology of multi-stage propelling devices
and the technology of posture control and thrust modulation
of long-range ballistic missiles can be applied to other
middle-range and long-range ballistic missiles that North
Korea is newly developing. Therefore, the launch may lead
not only to the improvement of other types of its ballistic
missiles including Nodong but also to the advancement of
North Korea’s entire ballistic missile program including the
development of new ballistic missiles and diversification of
attack measure.[45]

In Pyongyang Joint Declaration of September 2018 that
was agreed upon at the inter-Korean summit in September
2018, North Korea announced that it will permanently
dismantle the missile engine test site and launch platform in
the Dongchang-ri district under the observation of experts
from relevant countries. Regarding these facilities, it has
been pointed out that some parts of the satellite launch
platform has been rebuilt after the dismantlement.

42 There is also Taepodong-1, which may have been a transitory product for the development of Taepodong-2. Taepodong-1 is assumed to be a two-stage, liquid fuel propellant ballistic
missile with a Nodong used as its first stage and a Scud as its second stage. It is estimated to have a range of at least approximately 1,500 km. Taepodong-1 was launched from the
Taepodong district on North Korea’s northeastern coastline in 1998, and it is presumed that part of it flew over Japan and fell in to the Sanriku offshore waters.

43 The objects which were found to have washed ashore at a seashore in Tottori Prefecture in June 2016 were determined by the MOD to be parts of the fairing at the top end of the
Taepodong-2 variant missile launched in February 2016. The fairing is partially different from the ones that are usually used by rocket developer countries such as the United States and
European countries. Although the fairing is considered to possess the strength and heat resistance necessary for atmospheric entry, it was confirmed that weight reduction had not been
thoroughly pursued.

44 Articles dated October 1 and July 29, 2014 published on the website (38 North) of the U.S.-Korea Institute at Johns Hopkins University in the United States point out that analyses of
satellite images of the Tongch’ang-ri district show that the launch tower was raised to 55 meters, enabling launches of rockets up to 50 meters in height, larger than the Taepodong-2
variant (total height approx. 30 m) which was used in December 2012.

45 Furthermore, as launches from fixed launch pads are vulnerable to external attacks, North Korea may seek resiliency and survivability through building underground or silo launch facilities

showcased at the military parade in April 2012 and July
2013 are unknown. However, the missile is believed to be
an ICBM.[46] At the military parade in October 2015, a new
missile thought to be the “KN-08” was showcased with a
different-shaped warhead from the previous version.[47] The
new missile, considered a variant of the “KN-08,” is called
the “KN-14.” The “KN-08” and “KN-14” are carried by a
TEL, making it difficult to detect signs of their launch in
advance, and is likely intended to increase survivability.
**(k) Short-Range Ballistic Missiles, etc. Launched in 2019**
North Korea launched short-range ballistic missiles
presumed to be new types and others toward the Sea of Japan
nine times in total during May, July and August 2019.
(1) Short-range ballistic missiles launched on May 4 and 9,
July 25, and August 6, 2019
North Korea launched short-range ballistic missiles
(North Korea referred them as “new type of tactical guided
weapon”) on May 4 and 9, July 25, and August 6. They are
all presumed to have the same system, and are of a new
and different type from existing missiles such as Nodong
and Scud. On each day above, two missiles were launched,
and flew approximately 200 to 600 km. Judging from the
images released by North Korea, it can be confirmed that the
missiles were launched from the wheel-drive or continuous
track TEL. The characteristic radial exhausts of solid fuel
propellant engines can also be confirmed from each image.
In addition, the launched missiles have a shape similar to that
of Russian short-range ballistic missile “Iskander,” which
can fly at a lower altitude than conventional ballistic missiles
and on an irregular trajectory.
(2) Short-range ballistic missiles launched on August 24,
2019
North Korea launched two short-range ballistic missiles
(North Korea referred them as “super-large multiple rockets
launcher”) on August 24, 2019. These missiles are of a new
and different type from the above (1), and are presumed to
fly approximately 350 to 400 km. Judging from the image
released by North Korea, it can be confirmed that the missiles
were launched from the wheel-drive TEL. The characteristic
radial exhausts of solid fuel propellant engines can also be
confirmed from the image.
(3) Projectiles launched on August 10 and 16, 2019


North Korea launched some projectiles on August 10
and 16, 2019. As their characteristics are different from the
missiles launched so far, including their shape, the possibility
that they might be a new type of short-range ballistic missiles
different from the above (1) and (2) needs to be taken into
account.
In addition, North Korea seems to have launched some
kind of projectile on July 31 and August 2, 2019. In light of
repeated launches, it is deemed that North Korea is promoting
the sophistication of relevant technology and improvement
of capabilities related to ballistic missiles, so it is necessary
to continue to carefully monitor trends.
**b. Major Trends in Ballistic Missile Launches**
North Korea has repeatedly launched various types of
ballistic missiles. In particular, since 2016 it has conducted
as many as 50 ballistic missile launches, including launches
of what appear to be new types of missiles.
As for trends in North Korea’s ballistic missile launches,
the following characteristics have been observed. Firstly, it
appears that the country seeks to increase the firing range
of ballistic missiles.[48] In February 2016, it launched a longrange ballistic missile (a Taepodong-2 variant) which was
disguised as a “satellite,” and in the same year repeatedly
launched the Musudan, considered to have Guam in its
range. As for the IRBM that was launched in 2017, it is
expected to reach a maximum firing range of approximately
5,000 km. Furthermore, in July, ICBM were launched,
followed by another intercontinental-range ballistic missile
launch in November, which is considered to have been a new
type of missile that could have a range in excess of 10,000
km, depending on the weight of the warhead deployed,etc.[49]

Although it is considered necessary for the operationalization
of long-range ballistic missiles to further verify technology
for protecting the re-entry vehicle from the ultrahigh
temperature that is generated during the atmospheric re-entry
of the warhead part, North Korea announced in March 2016
that it had successfully conducted a “mock ballistic missile
atmospheric re-entry environment test”[50] and announced
that it had demonstrated atmospheric reentry technology for
warheads at the time of the launch in July 2017. In addition,
with announcements such as the one in November 2017 on
the day of the launch of what is believed to have been an


**Chapter**


46 The “Worldwide Threat Assessment” of the U.S. Director of National Intelligence of February 2015 notes that, “[North Korea] has publicly displayed its KN-08 road-mobile ICBM twice. We
assess that North Korea has already taken initial steps towards fielding this system, although the system has not been flight-tested.”

47 Jane’s Defence Weekly dated October 13, 2015 notes that the “KN-08” showcased at the military parade on October 10, 2015 had a larger third stage than the earlier version, and
therefore, could have an extended range. It also suggests that low quality ablative materials cannot withstand high temperatures during re-entry, and thus, a blunter shape warhead may
have been developed to reduce speed to protect the warhead.

48 North Korea is thought to have started developing longer-range ballistic missiles by the 1990s, including Nodong.
49 KWP Chairman Kim Jong-un's January 2017 “New Year’s Address” announced that the test launch of an ICBM had entered the final stage of preparation.
50 According to images released by North Korea, the aim of the test appears to be to conduct a test that simulates the high temperature that occurs during the atmospheric re-entry of the
warhead by firing the engine of the ballistic missile at the test object installed on a fixed platform. Generally, it is difficult to recreate the circumstances of the atmospheric re-entry of the
warhead by the emission from the engine alone. It is necessary to conduct technology verification by flight tests to conduct an accurate demonstration including the impact of the airflow,

intercontinental-range ballistic missile, claiming that it had
re-verified warhead reliability in a reentry environment,[51]
North Korea is displaying an intention to seek to secure and
enhance technology aimed at the operationalization of longrange ballistic missiles.[52]

Secondly, North Korea may be aiming to enhance the
accuracy and operation capabilities necessary for saturation
attacks with regard to ballistic missiles already deployed.
As for the Scud and Nodong, which are already deployed,
launches had been confirmed when Kim Jong-il was the
Chairman of the National Defense Commission. Since 2014,
they have been launched eastward from unprecedented
locations in western North Korea, cutting across the Korean
Peninsula, in the early morning and late hours of the night
using TELs, often in multiple numbers. This indicates that
North Korea is capable of launching Scuds and Nodongs
from any place and at any time, from which it is deemed that
it has increased confidence in the performance and reliability
of its ballistic missiles.
As for Scuds and Nodongs, since 2016, there have been
launches where it is presumed that warheads fell in Japan’s
EEZ, posing a major threat to Japan’s security. The ballistic
missile launched on August 3, 2016, that appears to be a
Nodong flew approximately 1,000 km, with its warhead
predicted to have fallen into the Japanese EEZ for the first
time. The three ballistic missiles launched on September
5 of the same year, apparently Scud ERs, were launched
simultaneously and are all estimated to have fallen in more or
less the same place in Japan’s EEZ after flying approximately
1,000 km. Moreover, the four ballistic missiles, apparently
Scud ERs, launched on March 6, 2017, were launched
simultaneously, three of which are predicted to have fallen
within Japan’s EEZ and the other near the EEZ, after flying
approximately 1,000 km.
It is possible that through these launches, North Korea’s
intentions are not only research and development of ballistic
missiles but also the enhancement of their operational
capabilities. Since Chairman Kim Jong-un has repeatedly
instructed the military troops to reject formality and conduct
practical training, it can be considered that these instructions
underpin the launches of ballistic missiles that have already
been deployed.
North Korea also has claimed that a new type of ballistic
missile which appears to have been modified from the Scud


missile launched in May 2017 is a ballistic missile that
incorporates a precision navigation guidance system,” and
it has also been noted that this missile is equipped with a
maneuverable re-entry vehicle (MaRV). It is deemed that
North Korea is aiming to enhance the accuracy of attack by
upgrading ballistic missiles that have already been deployed.
Thirdly, North Korea appears to be seeking to improve
its ability to conduct surprise attacks by enhancing secrecy
and instantaneity to make it difficult to detect signs of a
launch. Using a TEL or submarine, a ballistic missile can be
launched from any point, making it difficult to detect signs
of a launch in advance. North Korea has repeatedly launched
ballistic missiles from TELs and SLBMs. In addition, the
SLBMs repeatedly launched in 2016 and the ballistic missile
presumed to be modified from the SLBM as a groundlaunched type and launched in February and May 2017
appear to use solid fuel. It is thus possible that North Korea
is proceeding with the development of solid-fueled ballistic
missiles.[53] Generally solid fuel-propelled ballistic missiles
are pre-loaded with solid fuel, and therefore, they can be
launched instantly and the signs of their launch are more
difficult to detect. Furthermore, they can be reloaded more
quickly, and they are relatively easier to store and handle in
comparison to liquid fuel-propelled missiles. In this respect,
they are considered to be superior militarily. From these
factors, North Korea is deemed to be aiming to enhance its
surprise attack capabilities.
Fourthly, North Korea may be attempting to diversify the
forms of launches. It has been confirmed that at the June 22,
2016, Musudan launch and the May 14, July 4, July 28, and
November 29, 2017, launches of the ballistic missile, socalled lofted trajectories, in which missiles are launched at
higher angles than nominal to high altitudes, were utilized.
Generally, when a launch is made on a lofted trajectory,
interception is considered to be more difficult.
Should North Korea make further progress in the
development of ballistic missiles, including the verification
of reentry technologies, it may come to have a one-sided
understanding that it has secured strategic deterrence against
the United States. Should North Korea have such a false
sense of confidence and recognition regarding its deterrence,
this could lead to increases and the escalation of military
provocations by North Korea in the region and could create
situations that are deeply worrying also for Japan.


**Chapter**


51 Further analysis is necessary to determine whether North Korea was able to demonstrate the warhead protection technology during atmospheric re-entry necessary for the
operationalization of long-range ballistic missiles by the November 29, 2017, launch. In any case, by repeatedly launching ballistic missiles, North Korea is believed to be accumulating
relevant technology.

52 North Korea announced the implementation of the ground test for a “new type of large-output generator (engine) for ICBMs” in April 2016, the implementation of the ground test for a new
type of large-output generator (engine) for satellite-launch rocket launchers in September 2016, and the ground test for a new type of “large-output engine” in March 2017.

53 In addition, in images released together with reports by North Korean media about the visit of Chairman Kim Jong-un to the Chemical Material Institute of the Academy of Defense Science
on August 23,. 2017, a panel could be seen featuring the name “Pukguksong-3,” which, in view of the name “Pukguksong,” has led some people to speculate that North Korea is

**c. Future Outlook for Ballistic Missile Development**
In his “New Year’s Address” in January 2018, Chairman Kim
Jong-un declared the historic accomplishment of perfecting
the national nuclear forces, and called for “mass-production
of nuclear warheads and ballistic missiles, the power and
reliability of which have already been proved to the full,
to give a spur to the efforts for deploying them for action.”
North Korea’s development of long-range ballistic missiles
has also been covered in other publications, including the
2018 Nuclear Posture Review (NPR) of the United States
announced in February 2018, in which it was noted that
“North Korea may now be only months away from the
capability to strike the United States with nuclear-armed
ballistic missiles.” The Missile Defense Review (MDR),
released in January 2019, noted that North Korea already
possesses the capability to threaten the U.S. homeland with
missile attack.
At the Plenary Meeting of the Central Committee of the
KWP in April 2018, Chairman Kim Jong-un announced the
suspension of ICBM test launches. Then, at the U.S.-North
Korea summit meeting in June, he clearly expressed the
intention to work towards denuclearization. On the other
hand, as North Korea has done nothing more than announce
the suspension of test-firing of intercontinental ballistic
missiles, it has been noted that its nuclear and ballistic
missile plans remain intact.[54]

Given these points, it will be necessary to continue to
carefully monitor trends in North Korea’s ballistic missile
development program.

4 Domestic Affairs


**(1) Developments Related to the Kim Jong-un Regime**

After the demise of Chairman of the National Defense
Commission Kim Jong-il in 2011, Kim Jong-un became the
de facto head of the military, party, and the state by assuming
the position of Supreme Commander of the KPA, First
Secretary of the KWP, and First Chairman of the National
Defense Commission by April 2012. The framework of
the Kim Jong-un regime was laid out in a short period of
time. Since the transition to the new regime, there has been
a number of announcements of party-related meetings and
decisions, and in May 2016, the Seventh KWP Congress


was held for the first time since the last Congress in October
1980, 36 years earlier. These developments suggest that the
state is run under the leadership of the party. At the Plenary
Meeting of the Central Committee of the KWP in April
2018, Chairman Kim Jong-un expressed his intention to fully
concentrate efforts on economic construction. In addition, at
the Supreme People’s Assembly in April 2019, Chairman
Kim expressed his intention to continue to concentrate on
economic development. For example, he emphasized the
importance of economic independence and stated that North
Korea will “solidify the material foundations of socialism
by concentrating all national resources on economic
construction”.
Following the change in regime, Chairman Kim Jongun has conducted frequent personnel reshuffles, including
reshuffles of the top three military posts of the Director of the
General Political Bureau, the Chief of the General Staff, and
the Minister of the People’s Armed Forces. In turn, individuals
whom Chairman Kim Jong-un selected were assigned to
the key party, military, and cabinet posts. In addition, in
December 2013, Jang Song-thaek, Vice-Chairman of the
National Defense Commission and Chairman Kim Jong-un’s
uncle, was executed for “plotting to overthrow the state.”
It is believed that through such measures, the Chairman
endeavors to strengthen and consolidate a monolithic
leadership system.[55] Meanwhile, the North Korean media
began to report the activities of Chairman Kim Jong-un’s
younger sister, Kim Yo-jong, as a senior member of the
KWP.[56] She also attended meetings such as inter-Korean
summit meetings.
At the KWP Congress held in May 2016, Kim Jong-un

was named to the new post of KWP Chairman. In his report
on the work of the KWP Central Committee, the Chairman
set out that North Korea was a “nuclear weapons state,” and
said the country would consistently uphold the “Byungjin
line” policy of economic development and the building
of nuclear force as well as further boost its self-defensive
nuclear force both in quality and quantity. In this manner, the
Chairman demonstrated, both to those in and outside of the
country, North Korea’s readiness to continue with its nuclear
and missile development. Prior to the Congress, North Korea
conducted provocations at unprecedented frequency and
content, including the launch of ballistic missiles.


**Chapter**


54 Regarding North Korean ballistic missiles, the final report of the UN Security Council’s Panel of Experts assisting the North Korea Sanctions Committee, released in March 2019, pointed out
that North Korea has a consistent tendency to disperse its assembly, storage and test locations.

55 Following the execution of Jang Song-thaek, Vice-Chairman of the National Defense Commission, the North Korean media repeatedly calls for the strengthening of the “monolithic
leadership system” and “single-minded unity.” For example, an editorial in the Rodong Sinmun dated January 10, 2014, urged the people to stay cautious even of trivial phenomena and
elements which erode North Korea’s single-minded unity. In May 2015, it was suggested that Hyon Yong-chol, Minister of the People’s Armed Forces, may have been executed on charges
of treason. In July 2015, the North Korean media introduced Pak Yong-sik, previous Deputy Director of the General Political Bureau of the Korean People’s Army, with the title, Minister of the
People’s Armed Forces.

56 According to the Korean Central Broadcasting Station, Kim Yo-jong was elected a member of the KWP Central Committee at the KWP Congress held in May 2016. At the Second Plenum of

is still forced to rely on food assistance from overseas.[59]
Following North Korea’s various provocations including the
nuclear test in January 2016 and launch of a ballistic missile
disguised as a “satellite” in February 2016, the ROK decided
to completely suspend operations at the Kaesong Industrial
Complex, which makes up over 99% of inter-Korean trade.
Furthermore, the strengthening of sanctions by countries
including Japan and the United States, and the sanctions of
the related UN Security Council resolutions in response to
the implementation of nuclear tests and missile launches can
be assumed to have had a certain effect, when considered
together with the severe economic situation of North Korea.
Accordingly, if China, North Korea’s largest trading partner,
and other relevant countries continue to rigorously implement
sanctions an even more severe economic situation could
beset North Korea.
To tackle a host of economic difficulties, North Korea
has made attempts at limited improvement measures and
some changes to its economic management systems,[60] and
promotes the establishment of economic development
zones[61] and the enlargement of the discretion of plants and
other entities over production and sales plans.[62] Furthermore,
at the Plenary Meeting of the Central Committee of the
KWP in April 2018, in addition to declaring the “Byungjin
line” was successfully carried out, North Korea declared
that among other things, it had determined to “concentrate
all efforts on building a powerful socialist economy and
markedly improving the standard of people’s living through
the mobilization of all human and material resources of
the country.” These all suggest that North Korea is placing
importance on rebuilding its economy. Nonetheless, North

Korea is unlikely to carry out any structural reforms that
could lead to the destabilization of its current ruling system,
and thus, various challenges confront the fundamental
improvement of its current economic situation.
North Korea is presumed to be evading the UN Security
Council sanctions by conducting ship-to-ship transfers in the


The holding of the KWP Congress may be an indication
that North Korea has shifted into high gear by establishing
the state-run governance system centered on the party
and led by KWP Chairman Kim Jong-un, in terms of its
organization, personnel, among other dimensions, both in
name and in substance.[57] At the Supreme People’s Assembly
session convened in June 2016, it was decided that the
National Defense Commission would be turned into the State
Affairs Commission, and KWP Chairman Kim Jong-un was
named Chairman of the State Affairs Commission, the new
“highest position” of the “state” replacing First Chairman of
the National Defense Commission. These changes are also
likely to be manifestations of the governance system moving
into full swing.[58] Furthermore, Chairman Kim pointed out
that the role of the party organization should be decisively
enhanced in order to implement the “new strategic line,”
which fully concentrates efforts on economic construction.
This indicates that the importance of the party in politics
continues to grow. However, with senior officials unable to
dispute the decisions of Chairman Kim Jong-un due to an
atrophy effect created by the frequent executions, demotions,
and dismissals of senior officials, it is believed that there is
growing uncertainty, including over the possibility of North
Korea turning to military provocations without making
adequate diplomatic considerations. In addition, it has been
suggested that there is declining social control caused by
widening wealth disparities and information inflow from
other countries. In this regard, attention will be paid to the
stability of the regime.

**(2) Economic Conditions**

In the economic domain, North Korea has been facing chronic
stagnation and energy and food shortages in recent years due
to the vulnerability of its socialist planned economy and
diminishing economic cooperation with the former Soviet
Union and East European countries following the end of the
Cold War. Especially for food, it is deemed that North Korea

57 Elections for members and alternate members of the KWP central leadership agencies (e.g., KWP Central Committee and KWP Politburo) were held during the KWP Congress. Pak Pong-ju,
Premier, and Choe Ryong-hae, KWP Secretary (the title was changed from KWP Secretary to Vice Chairman of the KWP Central Committee at the KWP Congress), were newly elected as
KWP Politburo Standing Committee members to form a five-member Standing Committee including: Kim Jong-un, KWP Chairman; Kim Yong-nam, President of the Presidium of the
Supreme People’s Assembly; and Hwang Pyong-so, Director of the General Political Bureau. None of the five members of the KWP Politburo Standing Committee are genuine military
personnel. Furthermore, the ranks of military personnel have fallen within the KWP Politburo, and Premier Pak Pong-ju has been added as a member of the KWP Central Military
Commission. It is pointed out that these aspects show that a KWP-led governance system is shifting into high gear.

58 After the Supreme People’s Assembly session in June 2016, the media introduced the “Minister of the People’s Armed Forces,” who is considered equivalent to the minister of defense, as
the “Minister (Secretary) of the People’s Armed Forces,” raising the possibility that the Ministry of the People’s Armed Forces has been reorganized into the Ministry (Department) of the
People’s Armed Forces.

59 In a report released in December 2018, the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO) classified North Korea as a country requiring external assistance for food and
cited a shortage of agricultural machinery and fertilizer as a factor preventing North Korea from resolving its food shortage.

60 For example, North Korea conducted a currency revaluation (decreasing the denomination of its currency) at the end of 2009. The currency revaluation led to economic disorder, such as
price escalation due to shortfall of supply, which in turn increased social unrest.

61 During the plenary meeting of the KWP Central Committee on March 31, 2013, KWP Chairman Kim Jong-un instructed the establishment of economic development zones in each province.
Pursuant to these instructions, the Economic Development Zone Law was enacted in May of that year. To date, 21 economic development zones have been established.

62 While the details of the policy are not necessarily clear, it is understood that in the industrial sector, entities would be able to independently make production decisions and conduct sales
outside the scope of the national plan, as well as determine employee remuneration and benefits based on the situation of the entities. In the agriculture sector, an autonomous business
system would be introduced at the household level. It has been said that 1,000 pyeong (1 pyeong = approx. 3.3 m2) of land would be allocated per person, with 40% of the agricultural

high seas, which are forbidden under the terms of the UN
Security Council resolutions.[63] The final report of the UN
Security Council’s Panel of Experts assisting the North Korea
Sanctions Committee, released in March 2019, pointed out
that illegal ship-to-ship transfers of oil products and coal by
North Korea were increasing rapidly.

Resolutions against North Korea)


exercise, which is usually held in November-December. On
the other hand, North Korea has repeatedly insisted that
it cannot accept the United States’ demand for unilateral
denuclearization and that the U.S. side should also take
“corresponding measures.” North Korea is also calling for
the relaxation of the sanctions based on the Security Council
resolutions.
The second U.S.-North Korea summit meeting in February
2019 ended without any agreement being reached between
the two countries. At the Supreme People’s Assembly in
April 2019, Chairman Kim Jong-un indicated his stance of
continuing dialogue with the United States for a while. For
example, he stated that he was ready to hold a third U.S.North Korea summit meeting on the condition that the United
States find out “with a proper attitude a methodology that can
be shared with us” and that North Korea would wait for a
courageous decision from the U.S. till the end of this year.
In addition, when President Trump visited the ROK in
June 2019, he met the leader of North Korea at Panmunjom,
and they agreed to proceed with dialogue at the working
level. However, no concrete progress has yet been observed
in the North Korea’s dismantlement of weapons of mass
destruction and missiles.

**(2) Relations with the Republic of Korea**

The administration of President Moon Jae-in inaugurated in
May 2017 has expressed its position on North Korea that,
while putting emphasis on inter-Korean relations through
dialogue, it also indicated a stance of responding resolutely
through sanctions and pressure to provocations by North
Korea. In fact, in December 2017, the Moon administration
announced a new set of ROK sanctions against North Korea.
North Korea also continued to engage in repeated provocative
rhetoric and behavior against the ROK, including a statement
in October that if war were to break out on the Korean
Peninsula, the entire ROK would be reduced to ashes. These
events caused inter-Korean tensions to rise.
On the other hand, in his “New Year’s Address” in January
2018, Chairman Kim Jong-un indicated North Korea’s desire
to participate in the 2018 PyeongChang Winter Olympic
Games and demonstrated a willingness to improve interKorean relations. Following this, preparations were made for
North Korea to participate in the Winter Olympic Games.
During the Games, Kim Yo-jong visited the ROK, which


5 Relations with Other Countries


**(1) Relations with the United States**

The U.S. Trump administration announced that it would deal
with North Korea’s nuclear and missile issue based on the
concept of “all options are on the table” and adopted the
policy of exerting pressure on North Korea to abandon plans
to develop and proliferate nuclear weapons and missiles by
strengthening economic sanctions and diplomatic measures.
In response, North Korea repeated its previous assertions
that developing its own nuclear deterrent capability was
necessary in order to respond to the nuclear threat posed by
the United States, and continued to engage in provocative
rhetoric and behavior,[64] coupled with military provocations
such as ballistic missile launches.[65]

In June 2018, the historic first-ever U.S.-North Korea
summit meeting was held and both sides confirmed that they
would join their efforts to build a lasting and stable peace
regime on the Korean Peninsula. Chairman Kim Jongun made clear his intention to work towards the complete
denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula, and confirmed

that negotiations would continue with the United States.
Later, in July 2018, Secretary of State Pompeio visited North
Korea and held a working-level meeting. Secretary Pompeio
visited North Korea again in October of the same year, held
a meeting with Chairman Kim, and discussed a second U.S.North Korea summit meeting. In addition, Chairman Kim
invited inspectors to visit a nuclear test ground that North
Korea blew up in public in May 2018. Thus, the U.S.-North
Korea negotiations continued. Moreover, in order to support
the U.S.-North Korea diplomatic process, the United States
took such measures as cancelling regular U.S.-ROK joint
military exercises, including the Freedom Guardian exercise,
which was scheduled for August 2018, and the Vigilant Ace

63 Between the beginning of 2018 and the end of June 2019, MSDF patrol aircraft have observed 20 cases in which a North Korean-flagged tanker and a foreign-flagged vessel were
anchored side-by-side in the high seas. As a result of comprehensive judgment by the government, there are strong suspicions that the observed vessels were engaging in illegal ship-toship transfers. For details of these cases and information about Japan’s response, see Part III, Chapter 1, Section 2.

64 For example, on August 8, 2017, a spokesperson for the KPA Strategic Rocket Forces announced that North Korea was carefully examining the operational plan for making an enveloping
fire in the areas around Guam with its “medium- to long-range strategic ballistic rocket Hwasong-12.” In addition, in a statement by the Chairman of the State Affairs Commission on
September 22, Chairman Kim Jong-un noted that he was “giving serious consideration to exercising the highest level of hardline countermeasures in history.”

Summary of recent UN Security Council resolutions on sanctions against North Korea

was followed by a meeting in March between a delegation
headed by a special envoy from the ROK and Chairman
Kim Jong-un,[66] which served to facilitate preparations for
the inter-Korean summit meeting. The inter-Korean summit
meeting was held in April, resulting in the issuance of the
Panmunjom Declaration, which confirmed among other
matters that the two countries agreed to completely cease
all hostile acts against each other in every domain, and
confirmed the common goal of realizing, through complete
denuclearization, a nuclear-free Korean Peninsula. In
addition, in another inter-Korean summit meeting held
in May, Chairman Kim Jong-un reiterated his desire for
the complete denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula.
Furthermore, at the inter-Korean summit meeting in


**Chapter**


September, Pyongyang Joint Declaration of September 2018,
which referred to an ending of military hostilities, was issued.
In addition, the “Agreement on the Implementation of the
Historic Panmunjom Declaration in the Military Domain,”
which prescribed concrete measures to ease inter-Korean
military tensions, was signed. In 2018, North and South
Korea conducted activities related to the implementation of
the measures[67] based on these documents. The Panmunjom
Declaration also notes that the two countries will aim to
declare an end to the Korean War,[68] and the Pyongyang Joint
Declaration of September 2018 notes that Chairman Kim
Jong-un will visit Seoul soon. Future developments in interKorean relations will be closely watched.


66 According to an announcement by the ROK, in the meeting North Korea agreed to hold an inter-Korean summit meeting at the end of April and establish a hotline between the two leaders.
In addition, it was reported by the ROK that North Korea had indicated that it would have no reason to keep nuclear weapons if the military threat to the North was eliminated and its
security guaranteed, that it was prepared to engage in dialogue with the United States towards denuclearization and with a view to normalizing relations, and that while dialogue is ongoing
it would not resume provocations such as nuclear or missile tests. North Korea was also reported as expressing understanding for the regular U.S.-ROK joint military exercises.

67 According to an announcement by the ROK government, in October 2018, the demilitarization of the Joint Security Area in Panmunjom was completed based on the Agreement on the
Implementation of the Historic Panmunjom Declaration in the Military Domain. Since November 1, 2018, such measures as the suspension of various military exercises (by both countries)
around the DMZ and the establishment of a no-fly zone in airspace over the DMZ have been implemented. In addition, consultations are ongoing with respect to the activity of the InterKorean Military Committee, which will hold consultations on large-scale military exercises and arms buildup.

68 The Korean War began in June 1950 and in July 1953 an armistice agreement was concluded. In the Panmunjom Declaration, the two countries announced that they would engage in

**(3) Relations with China**

The China-North Korea Treaty on Friendship, Cooperation
and Mutual Assistance, which was concluded in 1961, is
still in force.[69] In addition, China is currently North Korea’s
biggest trade partner. In 2017, trade volume between
China and North Korea was very large, accounting for
approximately 90% of North Korea’s total trade (excluding
trade between North Korea and the ROK),[70] suggesting North
Korea’s dependence on China.
With regard to the situation in North Korea and its nuclear
issue, China has expressed support for denuclearization
on the Korean Peninsula, for peace and stability on the
Korean Peninsula, and solving problems through dialogue
and consultations. While it has endorsed the series of UN
Security Council Resolutions, which strengthen sanctions on
North Korea.[71] It has also stated that sanctions alone will be
unable to achieve a fundamental solution to the nuclear issue
and that a solution should be found through dialogue and
consultations. In this respect, China has expressed support
for the U.S.-North Korea dialogue, including U.S.-North
Korea summit meetings. China, as well as North Korea and
Russia, insists that denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula
should be gradual and simultaneous, with relevant countries
taking corresponding measures.
China is a vital political and economic partner for North
Korea and maintains a degree of influence on the country.
Although it has been noted that China-North Korea relations
had deteriorated because North Korea did not necessarily
take actions that were in accordance with China’s position.
For example, North Korea repeatedly conducted nuclear and
ballistic missile tests despite opposition from the international
community including China. However, in March 2018 the
first-ever China-North Korea summit meeting under the
leadership of Chairman Kim Jong-un was held,[72] in which the
two leaders agreed to further develop bilateral relations and
also for President Xi Jinping to make a visit to North Korea.
Chairman Kim Jong-un made another visit to China in May
and June and held meetings with President Xi, in which they
reportedly exchanged opinions on the denuclearization of the
Korean Peninsula and the outcomes of the U.S.-North Korea
summit meeting. Moreover, in January 2019, Chairman Kim
visited China again and held a meeting with President Xi, in
which they reportedly exchanged opinions on such issues as


the policy for the denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula.
In addition, President Xi visited North Korea in June 2019
for the first time since he was appointed President, and held
a meeting with Chairman Kim Jong-un. They reportedly had
discussion on the development of the relationship between
two countries and denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula.

**(4) Relations with Russia**

Concerning North Korea’s nuclear issue, Russia, along with
China, has expressed support for the denuclearization on
the Korean Peninsula and early resumption of the Six-Party
Talks. Following the sixth nuclear test conducted by North
Korea in September 2017, Russia condemned North Korea’s
nuclear test for violating UN Security Council Resolutions,
but also stated that measures that would escalate tensions
should be avoided. Nonetheless, Russia approved UN
Security Council Resolution 2375, which was adopted in
September 2017. Furthermore, although Russia endorsed
UN Security Council Resolution 2397, adopted in December
2017, it emphasized that pressure on North Korea should
make way for dialogue and negotiations.
Following the U.S.-North Korea summit meeting in June
2018, Russia has continued to demonstrate an active stance in
supporting political and diplomatic processes in the vicinity
of the Korean Peninsula and has called on relevant countries
to give consideration to consultations in a multilateral format.
As for recent activities, in April 2019, Chairman Kim
Jong-un visited Vladivostok and held a meeting with
President Putin to exchange opinions on the development of
the bilateral relationship and the Korean Peninsula situation.
In addition, President Putin is said to have accepted Chairman
Kim’s invitation to visit North Korea.


**Chapter**


**(5) Relations with Other Countries**

Since 1999, North Korea has made efforts to establish
relations with a series of West European countries and
others, including the establishment of diplomatic relations
with European countries[73] and participation in the ARF
ministerial meetings. Meanwhile, it has been reported that
North Korea has cooperative relationships with countries
such as Iran, Syria, Pakistan, Myanmar, and Cuba in military
affairs including arms trade and military technology transfer.
In recent years, North Korea is deemed to be strengthening


69 It includes a provision that if either of the signatories (China and North Korea) is attacked and enters into a state of war, the other would make every effort to immediately provide military
and other assistance.

70 According to an announcement by the Korea Trade-Investment Promotion Agency (KOTRA).
71 On January 5, 2018, the Ministry of Commerce of China announced that based on UN Security Council Resolution 2397, China would implement measures from January 6, including
restrictions on export of crude oil to North Korea and restrictions on export of refined petroleum products.

72 According to a statement released by China, in the China-North Korea summit meeting Chairman Kim Jong-un stated that the issue of denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula could be
realized if the ROK and the United States would take phased measures in step with North Korea in order to realize peace and reconciliation. This visit to China was the first overseas visit
made by Chairman Kim Jong-un since assuming the leadership of North Korea.

its relations with African countries, with North Korean senior
officials paying visits to African countries.[74] The underlying
purposes for enhancing relations with these countries include
the usual objective of deepening political and economic
cooperation. In addition, it appears that North Korea hopes
to acquire foreign currency by expanding its arms trade and
military cooperation with African countries – activities which
are becoming increasingly difficult due to sanctions based
on UN Security Council resolutions and political turmoil
in the Middle East. It is actually the case that transactions
that violate the terms of UN Security Council Resolutions
have been observed,[75] and the possibility that North Korea’s
illegal activities could provide a funding source for nuclear

1 General Situation


With regard to its North Korea policy, the Moon Jae-in
administration, which was inaugurated in May 2017, is
placing emphasis on improving the inter-Korean relationship
and easing tensions based on the Panmunjom Declaration,
issued at the inter-Korean summit meeting in April 2018 and
Pyongyang Joint Declaration of September 2018, issued at
the inter-Korean summit meeting in September in the same
year. How the North Korea policy of the Moon administration
will impact inter-Korean relations will continue to require
close attention.
The U.S. Forces, mainly the Army, have been stationed
in the ROK since the ceasefire of the Korean War. The ROK

has established very close security arrangements with the
United States primarily based on the U.S.-ROK Mutual
Defense Treaty. The U.S. Forces Korea have been playing an
important role in securing peace and stability of the region
such as playing a vital role in deterring the outbreak of largescale armed conflict on the Korean Peninsula.


and ballistic missile development is a cause for concern.
Following the adoption of the series of UN Security
Council Resolutions in 2017, various countries in Europe,
Africa, the Middle East, South Asia, and Southeast Asia
are reviewing their diplomatic and economic relations with
North Korea.[76] On the other hand, recently, North Korea
has been strengthening diplomatic relationships with other
countries. For example, Foreign Minister Ri Yong-ho visited
Vietnam, Syria, China and Mongolia in November-December
2018, and Kim Yong-nam, President of the Presidium of the
Supreme People’s Assembly, visited Cuba, Venezuela and
Mexico in November-December.

2 Defense Policies and Defense Reform of the ROK


The ROK has a defensive weakness, namely, its capital
Seoul, which has a population of approximately 10 million,
is situated close to the DMZ. The ROK has set the National
Defense Objective as follows: “to protect the country from
external military threats and invasions, to support peaceful
unification, and to contribute to regional stability and world
peace.” As one of the “external military threats,” the ROK,
in its Defense White Paper, used to designate North Korea as
the “main enemy” or state that “the North Korean regime and
its armed forces…will remain as our enemies.[77] In the ROK
Defense White Paper 2018, published in January 2019, while
continuing to describe North Korea’s WMDs as a threat to the
peace and stability of the Korean Peninsula, the designation
of the country as an enemy was eliminated. Instead, the white
paper states as follows: “The Republic of Korea’s armed
forces regard any forces that threaten and encroach upon our
sovereignty, territory, people and assets as our enemies.”[78]
In addition, the white paper emphasizes the importance of
omni-directional response to security threats.


**Chapter**


74 For example, in May 2016, President of the Presidium of the Supreme People’s Assembly Kim Yong-nam attended the inauguration ceremony of the President of Equatorial Guinea. He held
talks with the President, as well as with the leaders of the Republic of Chad, the Gabonese Republic, the Central African Republic, the Republic of Congo, the Republic of Guinea, and the
Republic of Mali who were attending the inauguration ceremony.

75 The final report of the UN Security Council’s Panel of Experts assisting the North Korea Sanctions Committee released in March 2019 points out that North Korea has attempted to supply
small arms and other military equipment to Houthi rebels in Yemen as well as to Libya and the Sudan through intermediaries.

76 For example, in September 2017, Spain recalled its ambassador to North Korea, and Italy followed suit in October. In September the Philippines announced that it would cease trading with
North Korea. Furthermore, in November Sudan announced that it had ceased all transactions with North Korea and in October Uganda announced that it had expelled all persons related to
the North Korean military or weapons-related companies.

77 The Defense White Paper described North Korea as an enemy under some ROK governments in the past and did not do so under others. However, the wording “North Korean regime and its
armed forces…will remain as our enemies” had been retained since the ROK Defense White Paper 2010, released in December 2010 under the administration of President Lee Myungbak.

78 Regarding North Korea, the ROK’s Defense White Paper 2018 notes as follows: “Although South and North Korea have alternately engaged in military conflict and in reconciliation and
cooperation, they have created a new security environment favorable for full denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula and the maintenance of permanent peace, as three inter-Korean
summit meetings and the first U.S.-North Korea summit meeting have been realized in 2018. [Omitted] However, North Korea’s weapons of mass destruction are posing a threat to the
peace and stability of the Korean Peninsula. Our armed forced will provide military support for efforts for full denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula and the maintenance of permanent

The ROK has continued to undertake reforms of its
national defense.[79] In recent years, in August 2012, in light of
the sinking of the ROK patrol boat and the bombardment of
Yeonpyeong in 2010, the Defense Reform Basic Plan (20122030) was released by the Ministry of National Defense of
the ROK,[80] which included enhancing deterrence capabilities
against North Korea and making the military even more
efficient. In March 2014, the Defense Reform Basic Plan
(2014-2030) was unveiled,[81] which included in its scope the
long-term development of defense capabilities in order to
respond to potential threats after the unification of the Korean
Peninsula while securing response capabilities against the
threat from North Korea. In February 2017, it announced
the Defense Reform Basic Plan (2014- 2030) (rev.1), which,
while maintaining the objectives and underlying tone of
Defense Reform Basic Plan (2014-2030), emphasizes having
readiness capability for simultaneous local provocations
and all-out war, while giving top priority to bolstering the
organization and military power for responding to nuclear,
missile and other asymmetrical threats from North Korea.
In July 2018, the ROK released the “Defense Reform
2.0,” which has set the following three main goals: making
omni-directional response to security threats, enhancing
military power based on advanced science and technology
and developing armed forces appropriate for a developed
country. This plan calls for continued promotion of efforts
to secure combat capabilities necessary for responding to the
threat from North Korea and also includes the reduction of
the troops and the mandatory military service period.[82]


3 Military Posture of the ROK


The ROK’s military capacity is as follows. The ground forces
consist of 22 army divisions and 2 marine divisions, totaling
520,000 personnel; the naval forces consist of 240 vessels
with a total displacement of approximately 217,000 tons;
and the air forces (Air Force and Navy combined) consist of
approximately 640 combat aircraft.
The ROK has been modernizing its military forces— not
only its Army but also its Navy and Air Force—in order to
establish an omnidirectional defense posture to deal with
future potential threats, not least threats from North Korea.
The Navy has been introducing submarines, large transport
ships, and domestically built destroyers. The Air Force is
currently promoting a program for the installation of the
F-35A as a next-generation fighter with stealth property.
In November 2017, the ROK Government announced a
revision of its missile guidelines, which stipulate the range
of ballistic missiles it possesses; the revision included the
elimination of warhead weight limit restrictions on ballistic
missiles, in order to enhance the deterrence against military
provocation by North Korea.[83] Furthermore, to address North
Korean nuclear and missile threats, in addition to expanding
the missile capabilities of the ROK Forces,[84] the ROK is
engaging in efforts to build a Korean-type three-axis system,
comprised of the following elements: a system known as “Kill
Chain” to conduct swift preemptive strikes using missiles and
other assets,[85] the indigenous missile defense system (Korea
Air and Missile Defense [KAMD]),[86] and the Korea Massive


**Chapter**


79 Under the Act concerning National Defense Reform passed in 2006, the Defense Reform Basic Plan must analyze and evaluate changes in the situation and the results of the promotion of
national defense reform and be revised and supplemented, even after its establishment.

80 The ROK Ministry of National Defense states that in order to convert the ROK Forces into an “order-made military structure” that matches the operational environment on the Korean
Peninsula, it will significantly expand response capabilities in the Northwestern Islands area, reorganize the senior command structure in preparation for the transfer of wartime operational
command, gradually proceed with the reduction and reorganization of the troops, and significantly expand response capabilities against missiles and cyberwarfare, etc. In order to build a
“high-efficiency developed country-type national defense operation structure,” it will also promote efficiency, reorganize the human resources control structure, enhance the welfare of the
military, and improve the military service environment of the troops.

81 The ROK Ministry of National Defense plans to introduce an additional three Aegis-class cruisers, develop next-generation destroyers and submarines, and introduce medium- and highaltitude reconnaissance drones and multipurpose satellites in order to secure response capabilities against existing and potential threats.

82 The troops are planned to be reduced from the current level of 618,000 personnel to 500,000 personnel. The mandatory military service period is planned to be reduced from 21 months to
18 months for the Army and the Marine Corps, from 23 months to 20 months for the Navy, and from 24 months to 22 months for the Air Force. In the past, the Defense Reform Basic Plan
repeatedly made a reference to the reduction of the troops.

83 The missile guidelines were established to restrict the range and warhead weight of ballistic missiles possessed by the ROK and were agreed by the governments of the United States and
the ROK in 1979. They were subsequently revised in 2001 and 2012. In the previous guidelines, which were last revised in 2012, provisions included, for example, that ballistic missiles
with a maximum range of 800 km should have a maximum warhead weight of 500 kg.

84 Regarding ballistic missiles, the Hyeonmu 2a, with an estimated range of 300 km, Hyeonmu 2b, with an estimated rage of 500 km, and the Hyeonmu 2c, with an estimated range of 800
km, are considered to be in operational deployment, for example. In addition, the ROK is considered to be developing a new ballistic missile following the abolition of the limits on the
weight of warheads due to the revision of the missile guidelines in 2017. Regarding cruise missiles, surface-to-surface cruise missiles, such as the Hyeonmu 3a, with an estimated range
of 500 km, the Hyeonmu 3b, with an estimated range of 1,000 km, and the Hyeonmu 3c, with an estimated range of 1,500 km, are considered to be in operational deployment, for
example.

In September 2018, the ROK held a launching ceremony for the Dosan Ahn Changho, a 3,000-ton class new submarine. It has been reported that this submarine will be installed with
submarine-launched ballistic missiles in the future

85 The ROK Ministry of National Defense explains that the system is capable of detecting and identifying signs of missile launch, determining attack, and actual attacking instantaneously. In
the ROK’s Defense White Paper 2016, it is explained that in order to construct the “Kill Chain,” in addition to enhancing monitoring and surveillance capabilities through the use of highaltitude reconnaissance unmanned aerial vehicles and military reconnaissance satellites, the ROK is enhancing strike capacity by securing extra surface-to-surface missiles, long-range
air-to-surface missiles, and Joint Attack Direct Munitions (JADM).

86 The ROK Ministry of National Defense has denied participation in the U.S. missile defense system, and has underscored that the ROK was creating its own indigenous systems. The

the three-axis system has been reconfigured into a “strategic
strike system,” which integrates the Kill Chain and KMPR,
and a “Korean missile defense system.” The focus of defense
has also changed from response to the threat of North Korean
missiles to omni-directional response to security threats.
In recent years, the ROK has actively promoted equipment
export, which reached approximately US$3.2 billion on a
contract value basis in 2017. Since 2006, the amount has
increased by nearly 13-fold in 11 years. It is reported that
export items have diversified to include communication
electronics, aircraft, and naval vessels.[88]

Defense spending in FY2018 (regular budget) increased
by about 8.2% from the previous fiscal year to nearly KRW
46.6971 trillion, marking the 20th consecutive year of
increases since 2000. According to the Defense Reform 2.0,
the ROK will increase the defense budget 7.5% on an annual
average.

Meeting (SCM) in October of the same year.[90] At the 46th
SCM in October 2014, the two countries agreed on “Concepts
and Principles of ROK-U.S. Alliance Comprehensive
Counter-missile Operations (4D Operational Concept)” to
tackle North Korean ballistic missile threats. At the 47th
SCM in November 2015, the implementation guidance on
the 4D Operational Concept was approved.[91] Additionally,
after North Korea went ahead with its nuclear test in January
2016, the United States and the ROK officially decided
to deploy THAAD[92] to U.S. Forces Korea in July 2016,
concluding the temporary deployment of it in September.
In addition, in a U.S.-ROK summit meeting also held in
September, the enhanced deployment of U.S. strategic assets
in and around the ROK on a rotational basis was agreed.
Furthermore, it was reported that in the regular U.S.-ROK
joint military exercise conducted in April 2018, around
300,000 ROK Forces personnel and around 23,700 U.S.
Forces personnel participated, as well as amphibious assault
ships and F-35B fighters. In June the two countries announced
that the U.S.-ROK joint military exercise “Freedom
Guardian” planned for August had been suspended, along
with two U.S.-ROK Marine Exchange Program training
exercises scheduled to occur within the next three months.
In October, they announced the cancellation of the Vigilante
Ace, a regular air force exercise conducted in NovemberDecember in usual years, in order to provide every possible
opportunity to continue the U.S.-North Korea diplomatic
process. Furthermore, in March 2019, they announced the
“conclusion” of the Key Resolve and Foal Eagle exercise,
which has been conducted in March-April in usual years, and
the implementation of Alliance (Dong Maeng), a combined
command exercise.[93]

At the same time, the two countries have worked to deal
with such issues as the transition of operational control

4 U.S.-ROK Alliance and U.S. Forces Korea


The United States and the ROK have taken various steps to
deepen the U.S.-ROK Alliance in recent years.
While regularly confirming the strengthening of the U.S.ROK Alliance at the summit level, as specific undertakings,
the two countries signed the U.S.-ROK Counter-Provocation
Plan for dealing with North Korea’s provocations in March
2013,[89] and approved the Tailored Deterrence Strategy,
designed to enhance deterrence against North Korean nuclear
and other WMD threats, at the 45th Security Consultative


87 The ROK Ministry of National Defense website states that “KMPR, the third axis, is a Korean-type massive retaliation concept, a system in which counterattacks are conducted by directly
aiming at the North Korean leadership including its war command headquarters, in the case where North Korea threatens with its nuclear weapons,” and “missile and other strike forces
capable of delivering simultaneous and massive precision strikes and elite professional special operation forces, etc. will be operated for this purpose.” In December 2017 it was reported
that a 1,000 personnel “special duties brigade” had been newly formed, which would be tasked with the duty of eliminating the North Korean leadership, and was expected to form a major
element in the KMPR concept.

88 Since the 1970s, the ROK has devoted efforts to the development of the defense industry, and since the 2000s, it has expanded exports of defense equipment. The Moon Jae-in
administration is placing emphasis on the enhancement of the defense industry as a new driving force of economic growth and as a means of job creation. As for exports in recent years,
in 2014, the ROK concluded a contract to export 12 FA-50 light attack aircraft to the Philippines. Among other contracts concluded in recent years are a contract in 2016 to export a frigate
to the Philippines, a contract in 2016 to export a supply vessel to New Zealand, contracts in 2017 to export the K-9 self-propelled artillery to Finland, Norway and India, and a contract in
2018 to export trainer aircraft to Indonesia.

89 The ROK Joint Chiefs of Staff has announced that the plan contains consultative procedures as well as robust and thorough response methodologies for the United States and the ROK to
take joint responses in the event of a North Korean provocation. However, the details of the plan have not been made public.

90 According to the Joint Communiqué of the 45th ROK-U.S. SCM, this strategy establishes a strategic framework for tailoring deterrence against key North Korean threat scenarios across
armistice and wartime, and strengthens the partnership between the United States and the ROK to maximize their deterrent effects. However, the details have not been made public.

91 According to the Joint Communiqué of the 46th SCM, the “Concepts and Principles” are designed to detect, defend, disrupt, and destroy missile threats including nuclear and biochemical
warheads. However, the details have not been made public. Furthermore, according to the “Strategic Digest 2015” of the U.S. Forces in the ROK, the “Concepts and Principles” apply from
peacetime to war, and will guide operational decision-making, planning, exercises, capability development, and acquisitions.

92 A ballistic missile defense system designed to intercept short- and intermediate-range ballistic missiles in their terminal phase from the ground. It captures and intercepts targets at high
altitudes outside of the atmosphere or in the upper atmosphere. See Part III, Chapter 1, Section 2 regarding the ballistic missile defense system.

(OPCON) to the ROK[94] and the realignment of U.S.
Forces Korea. For the transition of OPCON to the ROK,
the roadmap for the transfer “Strategic Alliance 2015”
was established in October 2010. Aiming to complete the
transition by December 1, 2015, the two countries have
reviewed the approach of transitioning from the existing
combined defense arrangement of the U.S. and ROK Forces,
to a new joint defense arrangement led by the ROK Forces
and supported by the U.S. Forces. Nevertheless, based on the
increasing seriousness of North Korea’s nuclear and missile
threats, the two sides decided at the 46th SCM to re-postpone
the transition of OPCON, and to adopt a conditions-based
approach, i.e., implementing the transition when conditions
such as the ROK Forces’ enhanced capabilities are met.
The ROK plans to develop core military competencies for
deterrence against and response to the threats from nuclear
weapons and missiles, which are required for the transition
of OPCON, by 2023. At the 50th SCM in October 2018,
it was decided that following the transition of OPCON, an
ROK military officer will serve as commander of the U.S.ROK Combined Forces, replacing the current arrangement
of a U.S. military officer serving as the commander. It was
also decided that regarding the ROK Forces’ operational
capabilities, their IOC will be assessed in 2019. In August


**Chapter**


2019, an IOC assessment was carried out during a combined
command exercise for the transition of OPCON.[95]

With regard to the realignment of the U.S. Forces Korea,[96]
an agreement had been reached in 2003 on the relocation
of the U.S. Forces’ Yongsan Garrison located in the center
of Seoul to the Pyeontaek area, south of Seoul, and on the
relocation of the U.S. Forces stationed north of the Han
River to the south of the river. Subsequently, however, the
agreement has been partially revised, due to various factors,
including: the relocation to the Pyeontaek area being delayed
due to logistical reasons such as increases in relocation costs;
in relation to the postponement of the transition of OPCON,
it has been necessary for some U.S. Forces personnel to
remain at Yongsan Garrison; and it was decided that the
counter-fires forces of U.S. Forces Korea would remain in
their location north of the Han River to counter the threat of
North Korea’s long-range rocket artillery. In July 2017 the
U.S. Eighth Army headquarters relocated to the Pyeontaek
area, and in June 2018 the headquarters of U.S. Forces Korea
and United Nations Command also relocated to the same
area. The realignment of U.S. Forces Korea could have a
significant impact on U.S. and ROK defense postures on the
Korean Peninsula, and as such it will be necessary to follow
future developments closely.


94 The United States and the ROK have had the U.S.-ROK Combined Forces Command since 1978 in order to operate the U.S.-ROK combined defense system to deter wars on the Korean
Peninsula and to perform effective combined operations in the case of a contingency. Under the U.S.-ROK combined defense system, OPCON over the ROK Forces is to be exercised by the
Chairman of the Korea Joint Chiefs of Staff in peacetime and by the Commander of the U.S. Forces Korea, who concurrently serves as the Commander of the Combined Forces Command,
in a contingency.

95 An opening statement made by Minister of National Defense Jeong Kyeongdoo at the U.S.-ROK Defense Ministerial Meeting held on August 9, 2019
96 The United States intends to consolidate and relocate the bases of the U.S. Forces Korea which are scattered across the ROK, in order to ensure stable stationing conditions for U.S. Forces
Korea and a balanced development of ROK land. The agreement between the United States and the ROK include: (1) an agreement to conduct the relocation to south of the Han River in two
stages (June 2003); and (2) the withdrawal of 12,500 of the nearly 37,500 personnel out of the ROK (October 2004). The United States has thus been transforming its posture in
accordance with these agreements. However, at the U.S.-ROK Summit Meeting in April 2008, the two countries agreed to maintain the current 28,500 as the appropriate troop level. Since

well as vitalizing high-level strategic dialogue. The ROK
Defense White Paper 2018 also makes clear that the ROK
will strengthen strategic communication with China.

**(2) Relations with Russia**

Military exchanges have been under way between the ROK
and Russia in recent years, including exchanges among
high-ranking military officials. The two countries have also
agreed on cooperation in the areas of military technology,
defense industry, and military supplies. In March 2012, the
two countries held the first ROK-Russia defense strategic
dialogue and agreed to regularize the dialogue. In November
2013, President Vladimir Putin visited the ROK, and a
joint statement was issued in which the two sides agreed to
strengthen dialogue in the areas of politics and security.
In June 2018, President Moon Jae-in visited Russia as a
state guest, becoming the first ROK president to do so in 19
years. In August 2018, defense strategic dialogue was held,
and it was agreed that the dialogue will be upgraded to the
vice minister level and that a hotline will be established
between the two countries’ air forces.
On the other hand, Russia opposes the deployment of
THAAD by U.S. Forces Korea for the reason that it is part
of the U.S. missile defense network and harms the strategic
stability of the region.


5 Relations with Other Countries


**(1) Relations with China**

China and the ROK have made continuous efforts to
strengthen their relations. Meanwhile, outstanding issues
have emerged between China and the ROK. The “ADIZ”
issued by China in November 2013 overlapped in some areas
with the ROK’s ADIZ. Furthermore, it included the airspace
above the sea areas surrounding the reef, Ieodo (Chinese
name: Suyan Rock), regarding which China and the ROK
have conflicting claims to the jurisdictional authority over
the exclusive economic zone. Against this backdrop, the
ROK Government announced the expansion of its own ADIZ
in December 2013 and enforced it from the same month.
The ROK is protesting that Chinese aircraft are repeatingly
intruding into the ROK’s ADIZ.[97]

China has protested that the deployment of THAAD to U.S.
Forces Korea would undermine China’s strategic security
interests. On this point, in October 2017 the governments
of China and the ROK announced that they had agreed to
utilize military channels to reach a mutual understanding
relating to China’s concerns about THAAD. In December
2017 President Moon Jae-in made his first visit to China
since his inauguration and the two leaders agreed to establish
a hotline and continue to maintain close communication, as

**1** **General Situation**


President Vladimir Putin, who has been seeking the revival
of Russia as a strong and influential power, successfully
achieved reelection in 2018. In his inaugural address in May
of that same year, President Putin stated that Russia is a
strong, active and influential participant in international life,
and that the country’s security and defense capability are
reliably secured. He also stated that quality of life, wellbeing,
security and health were his main goals, and that Russia has
risen like a phoenix a number of times throughout history
and would achieve a breakthrough again.
At the annual presidential address to the Federal
Assembly of Russia in March of that same year, held prior to
the presidential election, President Putin said, “Russia ranks
among the world’s leading nations with a powerful foreign
economic and defense potential.” At that same time, President
Putin talked about modernizing Russia’s military equipment,
including its strategic nuclear forces, and emphasized that
Russia would be developing new nuclear weapons as a
measure in response to the deployment of missile defense
systems by the United States domestically and abroad.
President Putin also expressed the recognition that Russia’s
military power helped maintain strategic parity in the world,
and remarked that Russia is prepared to negotiate toward
construction of a new system for international security and
sustainable development of civilization.
In response to the United States’ February 2019
notification of its intention to withdraw from the INF Treaty,
Russia announced in March that it had notified the United
States that it would suspend implementing its obligations
under the treaty.
With regard to the situation in Ukraine, ever since
the efforts to implement ceasefire agreements (Minsk
Agreements)[1] in the destabilized region of eastern Ukraine
following the illegal “annexation” of Crimea by Russia, there
have been no major developments in particular. The West has
alleged that Russia attempted to change the status quo by

force by engaging in “hybrid warfare,” and it is increasing
its sense of caution toward Russia.[2] Russia and Ukraine
continue to have a tense relationship, as demonstrated by
such developments as Ukraine’s temporary imposition of
martial law in November 2018, following the seizure of
Ukrainian naval vessels by the Coast Guard of the Border
Service of Russia.
In addition, Russia has been conducting military
intervention in Syria since September 2015. Russia has
indicated that it has the ability to continually and swiftly
deploy military assets in remote areas while acquiring bases
in Syria. At the same time, it is thought that Russia considers
the intervention as an opportunity to test and demonstrate its
equipment. As well as hosting Syrian peace talks brokered
by Russia, Turkey, and Iran, while continuing the fight
against ISIL and Hay’at Tahrir al-Sham (HTS) (formerly
known as Al-Nusra Front), Russia has signed a memorandum
of understanding with Turkey on the establishment of a
demilitarized zone around the northwestern Syrian province
of Idlib, which is a stronghold for the remaining rebels.
Russia’s growing involvement in the Syrian situation will
attract attention as a move aimed at expanding its influence
in the Middle East.


The Minsk Protocol of September 2014 consists of the following items: (1) ensure the immediate bilateral cessation of the use of weapons; (2) ensure monitoring and verification by the
Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe (OSCE) of the regime of non-use of weapons; (3) enact the Law of Ukraine “With respect to the temporary status of local selfgovernment in certain areas of the Donetsk and the Lugansk regions” (Law on Special Status); (4) ensure monitoring on the Ukrainian-Russian state border and verification by the OSCE,
together with the creation of a security area in the border regions of Ukraine and the Russian Federation; (5) immediately release all hostages and unlawfully detained persons; (6) prohibit
the prosecution and punishment of persons in connection with the events that took place in certain areas of Donetsk and Lugansk regions; (7) conduct an inclusive national dialogue; (8)
adopt measures aimed at improving the humanitarian situation in Donbas; (9) ensure the holding of early local elections in Donetsk and Lugansk regions; (10) remove unlawful military
formations, military hardware, as well as militants and mercenaries from the territory of Ukraine; (11) adopt a program for the economic revival of Donbass and the recovery of economic
activity in the region; and (12) provide personal security guarantees for the participants of the consultations.

Then, the Minsk Memorandum was signed in September 2014, and the package of measures for the implementation of the Minsk Agreement was signed on February 2015. These are
collectively called the Minsk Agreements.

While Russia faces severe economic conditions, forecasts
indicate that following the recovery in oil prices, a major
export product, the country will maintain positive economic
growth in 2019.[3]

Under these circumstances, attention is being paid on
how President Putin, while maintaining his power base,
will deal with Russia’s diplomatic isolation from Europe
and the United States, and economic situation, as well as
promote economic structural reforms and modernization of
Russia’s military forces, and its effort to expand international
influence.

risks: NATO’s military buildup; the realization of the U.S.
Global Strike concept; rise of global extremism (terrorism);
formation of governments in neighboring countries that carry
out policies threatening Russia’s interests; and the incitement
of ethnic, social, and religious confrontations in Russia.
The doctrine positions nuclear weapons as an essential
component for preventing the outbreak of nuclear wars
and military conflicts that use conventional weapons, and
states that Russia will maintain an adequate level of nuclear
deterrent capability. Additionally, it states that Russia
reserves the right to use nuclear weapons in retaliation not
only for the use of nuclear or other WMDs, but also in the
event of invasion using conventional weapons, where the
survival of the country itself is imperiled. In its assessment
of Russia’s non-strategic nuclear capabilities in the Nuclear
Posture Review published in 2018, the United States stated
that Russia recognized that its diverse and more numerous
non-strategic nuclear weapons systems could overpower an
opponent in a low-intensity conflict and believed that limited
first-strike use of nuclear weapons — including the use of
low-yield nuclear weapons — could give the country the
upper hand over the United States and its allies.
Furthermore, defending Russian interests in the Arctic
was newly added as one of the military’s tasks in peacetime.
As for Russia’s defense budget, the executed FY2017
budget registered a year-on-year decrease of around 25%
compared to the amount spent in the previous year, while
the amounts executed for FY2011-FY2016 showed year-onyear double-digit growth. Although Russia faced a difficult
fiscal situation in 2015 and 2016, including declines in


1 Basic Posture


Against the backdrop of foreign policy factors, including the
Ukrainian crisis and the military intervention in Syria, Russia
set out its objectives and strategic priorities of domestic and
foreign policies in the “National Security Strategy of the
Russian Federation” revised in December 2015.
The National Security Strategy construes that Russia
has an increasingly greater role in a multipolarizing world.
The Strategy perceives increased activity of NATO and
expansion of its member states as threats to national security,
and expresses its vigilance against the U.S. deployment of

missile defense (MD) systems to Europe and the Asia-Pacific
region for undermining global and regional stability.
In the defense domain, the Strategy commits to giving
continued priority to the role fulfilled by Russia’s military
force, and to ensuring strategic deterrence and preventing
military conflict by maintaining a sufficient level of nuclear
deterrent capability and the Russian armed forces (RAF).
The Russian Federation Military Doctrine, revised in
December 2014 as a document substantiating the principles
of the National Security Strategy in the military sphere, states
the existing view that while the probability of an outbreak
of a large-scale war is decreasing, military risks to Russia
are increasing, such as the movement of NATO’s military
infrastructure closer to Russia’s borders including the
expansion of NATO, and the establishment and deployment
of strategic MD systems. In addition, the doctrine expresses
growing alarm, defining the following as new military

economic growth, it is said that the country has worked to
secure a budget for national defense in order to achieve the
goal of modernizing its equipment by 2020 and other targets.
However, having used up the reserve fund[4] set aside for fiscal
replenishment, it is deemed that since 2017, Russia’s national
defense budget has been allocated based on the amount of
economic growth achieved.[5]

said proportion to approximately 61.5%. Within the State
Armaments Program (GPV: Gosudarstvennaya Programma
Vooruzheniya) 2018-2027,[9] it is said that Russia will continue
to invest 19 trillion rubles over ten years to update equipment
and an additional 1 trillion rubles to develop infrastructure
needed for the deployment of that equipment. It is expected
that Russia will continue modernization efforts in the future.
Regarding the professionalization of the military forces,
in order to make the combat readiness of the permanent
readiness units effective, Russia promotes the introduction
of a contract service system (for noncommissioned officers
and soldiers) which selects personnel who would serve under
contracts from the conscripted military personnel. In 2015,
the number of contract servicemen exceeded the number of
conscripted personnel for the first time, and in the future the
percentage of contract servicemen is set to increase further.[10]

2 Military Reform


**Chapter**


Russia has implemented full-scale military reform since
1997 by presenting the three pillars of reform: downsizing;
modernization; and professionalization. Moreover, based on
the policy statement, “Future Outlook of the Armed Forces
of the Russian Federation,” that was approved by President
Dmitry Medvedev (then) in September 2008, Russia is
advancing measures including troop reductions, structural
reform (from the division-based command structure to a
brigade-based one[6]), strengthening of combat readiness,
and modernization of the RAF such as the development and
introduction of new equipment.
Regarding the downsizing of the military forces, it was
decided that RAF would have a strength of one million
personnel as of 2016.[7] Since December 2010, Russia
reorganized its six military districts into four military districts
(Western, Southern, Central and Eastern Districts). On this
basis, Russia established a joint strategic command in each
military district and is carrying out integrated operations of

its entire military forces, such as the ground force, naval
force, and air force under the control of the Military District
Commander. In December 2014, the Northern Joint Strategic
Command in charge of the Arctic became operational.[8]

Regarding the modernization of the military forces, Russia
is working to increase its percentage of new equipment up to


4 In order to replenish funds for the government budget lost due to a fall in oil prices, Russia set aside a portion (the surplus) of governmental income received from oil production and
exports.

5 According to the Russian Federal Treasury, the initial FY2019 defense budget increased by 10.1% from the initial budget of the previous fiscal year to 3.1134 trillion rubles, marking a 5.4%
increase compared to the budget spent in the previous fiscal year.

6 The command structure is reorganized from the four-tiered structure of military district–army–division–regiment, to a three-tiered structure of military district–operational command–
brigade. Although this was said to be completed in December 2009, in May 2013 the Guards Tamanskaya Motorized Rifle Division and the Guards Kantemirovskaya Tank Division, which
had been reorganized into brigades under then Minister of Defence Anatoliy Serdyukov, were reactivated and participated in a victory parade. Furthermore, in the January 25, 2016 edition
of Krasnaya Zvezda (Red Star), a newspaper of the military, Gen. Oleg Salyukov, Ground Forces Commander, stated that four divisions were scheduled to be established in 2016 based on
the existing brigades.

7 It was decided that the total military force would be one million personnel as of 2016 by an executive order of December 2008 (the strength was approximately 1.13 million as of 2008).
According to TASS, an Executive Order issued by the President of Russia in July 2016 calls for the number of military personnel to be kept at one million.

8 The Northern Joint Strategic Command is a unified force led by the Northern Fleet and consists of fleets, ground forces, and air forces. Its area of operation covers the seas and remote
islands extending from the Barents Sea to the East Siberian Sea, and the Arctic coast.

9 The GPV was reportedly approved by President Putin by February 2018. While details have not been released, it is believed that, under the GPV, Russia will continue to prioritize the
updating of its nuclear capability and that 70% of the Russian military’s armaments are due to be modernized by 2021.

10 Reasons behind the promotion of the contract service system may include a decrease in the population suitable for military service and the shortening of the conscription period (since
January 2008, the conscription period has been shortened to 12 months). In March 2019, according to the Russian military newspaper Red Star, Minister of Defence Sergei Shoigu stated

as laying emphasis on future mass production of the HGV

half-yearly progress reports be provided on the development
and deployment of new weapons, including the “Avangard”
HGV, the “Sarmat” ICBM, and the “Kinzhal” air-launched
ballistic missile (ALBM). Additionally, he revealed for the

Russia emphasizes its nuclear forces to secure its global
position, to strike a balance with the nuclear forces of the
United States and to supplement its inferiority in conventional
forces. It is thus believed that Russia is making efforts to
maintain readiness.
Russia still possesses ICBMs, SLBMs, and long range
bombers (Tu-95 Bears and Tu-160 Blackjacks) comparable
to the United States in scale.
Russia is obligated to reduce strategic nuclear arms
pursuant to the New Strategic Arms Reduction Treaty
concluded with the United States.[11] Russia is working on
accelerating the development and introduction of new
weapons under the policy to prioritize the modernization of
nuclear forces based on its GPV.
In March 2011, Russia started the deployment of
RS24, which is considered a multi-warhead version of the

SSBN vessels, which carry the new-type SLBM “Bulava,”
were commissioned. There are plans to deploy four such
vessels each to the Northern Fleet and Pacifi c Fleet in the
future. In October 2018, fi ring training took place using an
SLBMs from a SSBN in the Okhotsk Sea and a SSBN from
the Barents Sea. Cruise missile fi ring training also took place
using long-range bombers.

11 In April 2010, Russia and the United States signed the New Strategic Arms Reduction Treaty to replace the Strategic Arms Reduction Treaty I (START I), and the treaty came into force in
February 2011. Each side is obligated to reduce deployed strategic warheads to 1,550 and their deployed delivery platforms to 700 within seven years after the entry into force of the
treaty. The United States announced that as of March 2019 the United States had 1,365 deployed strategic warheads and 656 deployed delivery platforms, and Russia announced that as
of March 2019, it had 1,461 deployed strategic warheads and 524 deployed delivery platforms.

first time that Russia was developing the “Zircon”, a sealaunched hypersonic missile that is believed to have a firing
range of over 1,000 km and be capable of speeds up to
approximately Mach 9.


As for non-strategic nuclear forces, Russia scrapped
ground-launched short- and intermediate-range missiles with
a range of between 500 and 5,500 km by 1991 in accordance
with the INF Treaty with the United States, and the following

year removed tactical nuclear weapons from naval vessels
for storage onshore. Russia, however, still possesses a broad
array of other nuclear forces and has in recent years been
moving forward with deployments of the “Iskander” groundlaunched ballistic missile system, which is believed to be
capable of carrying either conventional or nuclear warheads,
and the “Kalibr” sea-launched cruise missile system.
As well as commenting on Russia’s breaches of the
INF Treaty since May 2013 and repeatedly demanding
that the country return to compliance with the treaty, the
United States announced that Russia had deployed GroundLaunched Cruise Missiles (GLCM), which violate the treaty.
On the other hand, Russia has consistently denied violating
the treaty and has criticized the United States, saying that
it is itself in breach of the INF Treaty, on the grounds that
Aegis Ashore is equipped with a system capable of launching
Tomahawk missiles. Thus, the United States and Russia
remain as far apart as ever on matters concerning the treaty.
Amid this situation, the United States provided notice in
February 2019 of its intention to withdraw from the treaty
within six months and announced its intention to develop
surface-launched intermediate-range missiles capable of
carrying conventional warheads. Russia adopted a response
that was both symmetrical and asymmetrical, announcing

**KEY WORD**


Russian ground-launched cruise missiles
deemed by the United States to violate the INF
Treaty

The United States fi rst offi cially referred to the existence of Russian groundlaunched cruise missiles that violated the INF Treaty in July 2014;
subsequent references were made to what the United States and others
called the “SSC-8” and Russia called “9M729” and, by the latter half of
2018, the United States announced that several of these missile battalions
had been deployed. While the United States has not revealed such details of
the missiles as their range, it has pointed out that they were developed on
the basis of the Kalibr sea-launched anti-surface cruise missiles, which are
believed to have a range of 2,000 km. In January 2019, Russia unveiled the
9M729 claimed by the United States as being in violation of the treaty and
again denied that the missile breached the treaty, claiming that it was an
improved version of the SSC-7 (called the 9M728 in Russia) cruise missile
carried by the Iskander surface-to-surface missile system and had a range
of 480 km.


plans to develop a ground-launched adaptation of the Kalibr
sea-launched cruise missile system, along with hypersonic
ground-launched cruise missiles and, that March, notifi ed
the United States that it was suspending its own participation
in the treaty. Russia confi rmed that the treaty ceased to
have effect due to the United States’ complete withdrawal,
and criticized the United States by saying that all the
responsibility for escalating tensions across the world will
rest with Washington. Furthermore, Russia stated that it
is essential to resume full dialogues to safeguard strategic
stability and security, and that Russia is open to that.

2 Conventional Forces and Other Issues


Russia is developing and procuring conventional forces in
accordance with its GPV. Close attention will need to be
paid to Russia’s development, procurement, and deployment
of new equipment, such as the “Su-57”[13] currently under
development as the so-called “fi fth generation fi ghter” and
the T-14 Armata tank,[14] in addition to the introduction of
the Su-35 fi ghter and the surface-to-surface missile system
“Iskander.”
Along with carrying out a range of exercises,[15] since
February 2013, the RAF has been conducting surprise
inspections designed to validate the combat readiness
of the military districts, etc. since the collapse of the
Soviet Union.[16] These inspections are contributing to the
improvement of long-distance mobilization capability of the

13 In August 2018, the Russian military ordered two Su-57 fi ghter aircraft with interim engines; some have noted that this fi ghter is due to enter mass production in 2023.

14 A new tank fi tted with an unmanned turret that was unveiled for the fi rst time during the Victory Day Parade on May 9, 2015. In addition to this tank, Russia is currently developing a family
of crawler and wheeled infantry fi ghting vehicles, armored personnel carriers, self-propelled howitzers, and so on. A contract for 100 tanks was concluded in 2016, with the delivery of the
tanks scheduled to occur in 2020.

15 As it proceeds with its military reform, Russia has conducted large-scale exercises for verifi cation and other purposes in recent years. Among them are large-scale annual exercises
covering all aspects of combat training, which are held in a round-robin format involving all military districts Russia plans to hold the Tsentr 2019 exercise this year. (Exercises from the
previous four years included: Tsentr 2015 [Central Military District], Kavkaz 2016 [South Military District], Zapad 2017 [West Military District], and Vostok 2018 [East Military District].)

16 Surprise inspections were conducted at the Central and Southern Military Districts in February 2013, Southern Military District in March 2013, Western Military District in May 2013,
Eastern and Central Military Districts in July 2013, strategic nuclear units in October 2013, and Western and Central Military Districts from February to March 2014. In September 2014, a

RAF.[17] Furthermore, outside of Russia, the RAF have been
deploying vessels mainly formed of the Black Sea Fleet to the
Mediterranean Sea.[18] In September 2018, the Northern Fleet,
Baltic Fleet, Black Sea Fleet and Caspian Flotilla gathered
off the coast of Syria, east of the Mediterranean Sea, and
conducted a major joint exercise that also involved aircraft.
A plan is underway to construct or rebuild 10 airfi elds in
the Arctic, and between August and October 2018, a fl otilla
mainly comprising Northern Fleet Udaloy-class destroyers
took part in various landing drills during ocean navigation
from the Kola peninsula to the eastern Arctic.[19] Additionally,
some fl eets advanced into the Bering Strait as part of
the large-scale Vostok 2018 exercise. The RAF has been
conducting activities including not only such deployment and
exercises of naval vessels and resumption of military facility
operation, but also strategic nuclear deterrence patrols by
SSBN and patrol fl ights by long-range bombers. Particularly

1 General Situation


Russia newly established the Eastern Military District and
the Eastern Joint Strategic Command in 2010. Land Forces,
the Pacifi c Fleet, and the Air Force and Air Defense Units
have been placed under the Military District Commander,
who conducts unifi ed operation of these services.
The current presence of the RAF in the Far East region
is signifi cantly smaller than it was at its peak. However, a
considerable scale of military forces, including nuclear
forces, still remains in the region. Russian armed forces
in the vicinity of Japan are generally increasing activity,
including the trend related to deployment of new units and
military facility development.
Given that the RAF set their basis of operation on
maintaining the combat readiness of their strategic nuclear
units and dealing with confl icts through the intertheater
mobility of its round-the-clock readiness units, it is necessary
to keep our attention on the positioning and trends of the
RAF in the Far East region while also keeping in mind the
trends of units in other regions.


in 2018, Tu-95 long-range bombers fl ew to western Alaska in
September, and Tu-160 long-range bombers fl ew more than
10,000 km to Venezuela over the Barents Sea, the Norwegian
Sea, the Atlantic Ocean, and the Caribbean Sea in December.
In addition, the RAF continues to operate two permanent
bases within Syria, though in December 2017 it largely
terminated the military operations that it had conducted in
Syria since 2015.
Russia thus appears to be stepping up military activities
not only in the Arctic, Europe, areas near the United States,
and the Middle East, but also in the Far East, so close scrutiny
of developments in this regard will be required.[20]

In addition, as Russia’s levels of economic and social
development going forward and trends in its diplomatic
relations with European and other countries will infl uence
the future of the RAF, continuous attention should be paid to
its movements.

**(1) Nuclear Forces**

As for strategic nuclear forces in the Far East region, three
Delta III-class SSBNs and two Borey-class SSBNs equipped
with SLBMs are deployed in and around the Sea of Okhotsk,
and approximately 30 Tu-95 long-range bombers are deployed
in Ukrainka. Russia is prioritizing the reinforcement of its
maritime strategic deterrence posture which had been greatly
scaled-down compared to the former Soviet Union, and as
part of these efforts, it plans on deploying four Borey-class

17 At the Expanded Meeting of the Defence Ministry Board in December 2015, Minister of Defence Shoigu stated that the surprise inspections held fi ve times a year on average would enable
the commanders of every military district and military service as well as staff to mobilize long distances and execute tasks in unknown regions.

18 Russia’s naval fl eet in the Mediterranean which is said to have completed its formation on June 1, 2013, is considered a permanent operational force.

19 Among the military installations being developed in the Arctic, it is believed that the bases under construction on Alexandra Island in the Franz Joseph Land and Kotelny Island in the
Novosibirsk Islands will house 150 and 250 personnel each and have enough supplies to continue operations without assistance for a period of 18 months. In addition, the Northern Fleet
has conducted long distance navigation to the Novosibirsk Islands every year since 2012.

The Pacifi c Fleet is stationed or deployed at its main bases
in Vladivostok and Petropavlovsk. The fl eet is comprised
of approximately 260 ships with a total displacement
in the region of approximately 640,000 tons, including
approximately 20 major surface ships and approximately 20
submarines (approximately 15 of which are nuclear powered
submarines) with a total displacement of approximately
310,000 tons. It also plans on deploying four multipurpose
Steregushchiy-class frigates,[21] and the “Gremyashchiy” —
an improved version of the Steregushchiy-class frigate that
could be deployed as early as 2019 — is believed to be the
fi rst vessel in the Pacifi c Fleet to be armed with Kalibr cruise
missiles.


SSBNs to the Pacifi c Fleet by 2020.

**(2) Ground Forces**

As part of its military reforms, Russia is thought to be
reorganizing the command structure from a division-based
to a brigade-based one, while also shifting all of its combat
forces into permanent readiness units. The Eastern Military
District now consists of ten brigades and two divisions with
approximately 80,000 personnel in total as well as a marine
brigade equipped with amphibious operations capability.
The Eastern Military District has introduced new equipment,
such as the “Iskander” surface-to-surface missile system,

of Defense as having transited this strait at the same time
since the end of the Cold War. In recent years, ten or more
Russian naval vessels have passed through the Soya Strait
one to three times a year.[23] Additionally, survey activities
have taken place on Matsuwa Island located roughly in the
middle of the Chishima Islands, with the objective of studying
the feasibility of deploying Pacific Fleet’s forces there in the
future, and it is said that a new runway has been completed
on that island as well.[24] It is also pointed out that bases will be
constructed on Matsuwa Island as well as Paramushir Island,
located in the north of Chishima Islands, and that there are
plans to deploy Bal and Bastion surface-to-air missiles there.
Attention must be paid to movement towards the construction
of a coastal defense system covering the Northern Territories
and Chishima Islands.
Regarding aircraft, since the resumption of the patrol

activities by its strategic aviation units in 2007, Russia has
been increasing flights by long-range bombers. Also, there
were flights of Tu-95 long-range bombers refueled in midflight and supported by A-50 early warning and control
aircraft and Su-27 fighters as well as flights of Tu-160.
Russian aircraft were particularly active in FY2014 during
the height of tensions in Ukraine, and in April the same year
when eastern Ukraine began to destabilize, unusual flights
took place with Tu-95 long-range bombers conducting flights
around Japan on four occasions in one month. On two of these


350 combat aircraft from its Air Force and Navy combined.
Existing models are being modernized and new models, such
as the Su-35 fighters and the Su-34 fighter-bombers, are being
introduced[22] to improve their capabilities.

2 Operations in the Vicinity of Japan


In the vicinity of Japan, the RAF has been generally
increasing its activities, including exercises and drills which
are believed to be conducted for objectives such as verifying
the results of the military reform.
In September 2018, Vostok 2018, considered the largest
since 1981, was carried out in the Eastern Military District.
According to a Russian Defense Ministry announcement,
approximately 300,000 personnel, 36,000 tanks and other
vehicles, 80 vessels, and 1,000 aircraft participated in the
exercise. The participating units undertook long-distance
maneuvers over distances of up to 7,000 km, while vessels
of the Northern Fleet sailed up to 4,000 nautical miles. The
Chinese and Mongolian militaries also participated in the
exercise. Vostok 2018 is positioned as an annual strategic
military exercise hosted in turn by each of four military
districts and is regarded as an initiative aimed at giving the
participating military forces the capacity to engage in largescale conflicts with military superpowers over a short period
and the ability to wield influence over potential enemies.
Notable features of this year’s exercise were the size of the
units deployed and the participation of countries other than
Russia’s allies.
The number of exercises carried out by the Russian Land
Forces in the areas adjacent to Japan has decreased from the
peak. However, its activities are generally increasing.
With regard to naval vessels, their activities are generally
increasing in recent years. For example, various exercises and
long distance voyages have been carried out by Pacific Fleet
vessels, along with assigned missions involving operations
in Syria and patrols by nuclear-powered submarines. In
September 2018, 28 naval vessels including a Slava-class
guided missile cruiser passed through the Soya Strait. This
was the largest number of vessels announced by the Ministry


**Chapter**


22 According to “The Military Balance 2019,” in addition to 34 Su-35 fighters, 26 Su-34 fighter-bombers have been deployed to the Eastern Military District (11th Army of Air and Air Defence Force).

23 The number of cases of the Russian naval fleet passing through the three international straits (Soya, Tsugaru, and Tsushima) of Japan that have been identified and released in FY2018 is
as follows: 17 cases in the Soya Strait (12 in FY2017, 18 in FY2016, 22 in FY2015); 0 case in the Tsugaru Strait (1 in FY2017, 1 in FY2016, 0 in FY2015); and 4 cases in the Tsushima Strait
(3 in FY2017, 7 in FY2016, 4 in FY2015).

24 In May 2016, the Russian Ministry of Defence announced that under the command of Vice Admiral Andrei Ryabukhin, Deputy Commander of the Pacific Fleet that arrived in Matsuwa Island,
an expedition comprised of approximately 200 personnel including representatives from the Russian Ministry of Defence, the Russian Geographical Society, the Eastern Military District,
and the Pacific Fleet began conducting survey activities. Colonel-general Sergei Surovikin, Commander of the Eastern Military District, stated at a military meeting of the district that six
Pacific Fleet vessels and over 200 personnel participated in an expedition by the Russian Ministry of Defence and the Russian Geographical Society to Chishima, Etorofu, and Kunashiri
Islands, and that its primary objective was to study the feasibility of establishing a Pacific Fleet base in the future. Furthermore, it was announced that three ships of the Pacific Fleet and
around 100 personnel arrived on Matsuwa Island in June 2017 in order to conduct a secondary survey. Sakhalin.info reported in October 2017 that a new runway had been completed on
Matsuwa Island, and that it was accepting aircraft landings around the clock. In March 2018, the Russian military newspaper Red Star reported that Russia’s Pacific Fleet is currently

occasions, a total of six Tu-95 flew on the same day.[25] While
the number of scrambles against Russian aircraft fell from
the previous year, Russian aircraft continued to be active in
FY2018, as shown by the flights by Tu-142 maritime patrol
aircraft around Japan in September 2018. In June 2019,
two Tu-95 long-range bombers flew around Japan, and
intruded into Japan’s territorial airspace twice when they
flew northward over the Pacific Ocean. In July last year, two
Russian Tu-95 long-range bombers carried out “first Russia
**5** **Russian Forces in Japan’s Northern Territories**


Since 1978 during the former Soviet Union era, Russia
has redeployed ground troops on Kunashiri, Etorofu, and
Shikotan Islands of the Northern Territories, which are
inherent territories of Japan. While the Russian troop strength
is thought to be far less than that at peak times, one division is
still stationed in Kunashiri and Etorofu Islands. Furthermore,
tanks, armored vehicles, various types of artillery, and antiair missiles are deployed.[27]

After then President Medvedev visited Kunashiri Island
for the first time as head of state in November 2010, Russian
ministers and others have made repeated visits to the Northern
Territories. In the recent past, Prime Minister Medvedev
visited Etorofu Island in August 2019.[28] Also, Russia is
proceeding with the development of military facilities in the


China joint air patrol with two Chinese H-6 bombers from
the Sea of Japan to the East China Sea. In addition, one
Russian A-50 early warning and control aircraft allegedly
supporting Tu-95 long-rage bombers[26] intruded into Japan’s
airspace above the territorial waters of Takeshima Island in
Shimane Prefecture.

Northern Territories.[29] In November 2016, Russia announced
that it deployed coastal (surface-to-ship) missiles to Etorofu
and Kunashiri Islands.[30] In January 2018, the new civilian
airport built in 2014 in Etorofu Island in addition to Tennei
military airfield was opened up to joint military and civilian
use, with three Su-35 fighter aircraft reportedly deployed
to the new airport in August 2018. Russia also continues to
carry out military exercises on islands that can include the
Northern Territories and announced in April 2018 that it had
conducted a military exercise that involved more than 2,500
personnel, along with multiple rocket launchers, tanks, and
helicopters.
As described above, Russia continues to station RAF in the
Northern Territories, which are inherent territories of Japan,


25 The number of times Russian military aircraft flew around Japan since FY2013 was: one time in FY2013; six times in FY2014; two times in FY2015; one time in FY2016; one time in
FY2017; and one time in FY2018.

26 According to Russian reports, at a briefing held on July 23, Lieutenant-General Kobylash, commander of Russia’s Long-Range Aviation announced that the first Russia-China joint air patrol
on the same day was backed up by aircraft of the combat forces, a Russian A-50 and a Chinese KJ-2000 early warning and control aircraft.

27 The 18th Machine Gun and Artillery Division, which is comprised of two regiments, is one of the few division units making up the RAF since most divisions were transformed into brigades
due to military reform, and is stationed on Etorofu and Kunashiri Islands to prevent landings. The number of Russian military personnel stationed in this region in 1991 was approximately
9,500. At the Japan-Russia Defense Ministerial Meeting held in 1997, then Russian Defence Minister Igor Rodionov revealed that the troops stationed in the Northern Territories had been
reduced to 3,500 personnel by 1995. In July 2005, when then Russian Defence Minister Sergei Ivanov visited the Northern Territories, he declared that Russia would neither increase nor
decrease the troops stationed on the four islands, clarifying Russia’s intention to maintain the status quo. In February 2011, a senior official of the General Staff was said to have stated that
troops on the Northern Territories would be maintained at around 3,500 personnel in the process of reorganizing divisions into brigades. However, the total number of troops on the
Northern Territories is believed to have increased, due to the deployment of a naval surface-to-ship missile unit announced in November 2014 and an air force fighter unit reported in

**Vostok 2018**

Russian Forces conduct a large-scale strategic military exercise as a climax of annual exercises alternately in four military
districts – Eastern, Central, Southern and Western – and call the four exercises Vostok (east), Tsentr (central), Kavkaz
(Caucasus) and Zapad (west), respectively.
The annual climax exercise is reportedly designed for the General Staff to accomplish presidential missions to (1)
plan and verify the transition of Russia, including the Ministry of Defense and other government agencies and private
enterprises, from peacetime to wartime and (2) test a setup for a large-scale severe war that requires national response.
Vostok 2018, conducted mainly in the Eastern Military District, was announced as the largest exercise since 1981,
mobilizing about 300,000 troops, about 36,000 battle tanks and other vehicles, about 80 ships, and about 1,000 aircraft
from the Central Military District and the Northern Fleet as well as the Eastern Military District. The disclosed number of
300,000 participating troops is viewed as covering all participants in the main exercise during the disclosed exercise period
of September 11-17 and various preparatory activities from July (such as long-range unit deployment drills, logistic and
combat support drills and surprise drills for checking readiness), with the main exercise participants limited to less than
100,000 troops, or as exaggerating the number of participants to demonstrate a strong military presence.
At a drill site close to the border with China and Mongolia, about 3,200 servicepersons, about 900 tanks and other
vehicles, and about 30 fixed- and rotary-wing aircraft from China conducted a joint drill with Russian Forces. A ChinaRussia-Mongolia military parade was conducted at the site, with Russian President Vladimir Putin and the Russian and
Chinese defense ministers visiting the site. Although Russia and China earlier conducted naval and other joint drills,
Vostok 2018 was the first Russian annual climax exercise in which China participated. Earlier, Russia conducted annual
climax exercises alone or jointly with some allies (Belarus and Kazakhstan among the members of the Collective Security
Treaty Organization). Vostok 2018 attracted attention as China emphasized that it participated in the Russian exercise by
dispatching the largest number of troops abroad in history and as it was pointed out that China and Russia could have been
further promoting their military cooperation to check the United States.
Vostok 2014, conducted four years ago, was also a large-scale exercise with about 155,000 troops participating. While
the exercise centered on Far Eastern and Arctic coastal zones and islands, including the Kamchatka Peninsula that the
Russian defense minister visited during the exercise, Vostok 2018 featured dominant inland drills, including those at the site
visited by the Chinese and Russian defense ministers, with coastal and island drills limited to those by the Northern Fleet
in Arctic coastal zones and islands and in the Bering Sea.

**6** **Relations with Other Countries**

1 General Situation


Russia considers the realization of its national interests as
a guiding principle of its foreign policy, recognizing the
multipolarization of international relations, the shift of global
power to the Asia-Pacific region, and the growing importance
of force in international relations.[32] Moreover, based on its
National Security Strategy, Russia engages in open, rational,
and pragmatic diplomacy to protect its national interests.
It aims to pursue multidirectional diplomacy by ruling
out futile confrontation and acquiring as many partners as
possible around the world.[33]

For this reason, Russia has been working on deepening
its economic partnerships with the Commonwealth of
Independent States (CIS)[34]. Furthermore, Russia aspires to
deepen its relations with the Asia-Pacific countries, seen
as drivers of the global economy, and in recent years, has
attached importance to China and India as countries with
which to strengthen bilateral relations.
Meanwhile, Russian efforts to strengthen its cooperative
relations with the West are still facing challenges after
the Ukrainian crisis. However, with regard to the Syrian
situation, Russia is exploring the possibility of cooperation
with other countries towards stabilizing Syria and countering
international terrorist organizations, including ISIL.
Attention will be paid to how Russia would balance its
posture of economic-centered and benefit-focused foreign
policy with Russia’s politics and diplomacy including
security in order to develop its relations with other countries.


military aircraft around Japan and called for a calm response
from Russia. Closer attention must be paid to Russian
military movements in the Far East, including the Northern
Territories.

2 Relations with Asian Countries


Russia recognizes that the significance of the Asia-Pacific
region is increasing within its multi-pronged foreign policy,
and considers it strategically important to strengthen its
status in the region from the viewpoint of socioeconomic
development in Siberia and the Far East, and security.[35] To
achieve strategic stability and equal strategic partnerships,
Russia places particular emphasis on developing a
comprehensive partnership relationship and strategic
cooperative relationship with China as a key factor in
maintaining global and regional stability, and also intends
to assign an important role for the privileged strategic
partnership with India.[36]

Russia continues to advance close military cooperation
with China. Export agreements on new armaments such as
the S-400 surface-to-air missile system and Su-35 fighter jets
were concluded in 2015, and since 2012, Russia and China
have been conducting joint naval exercise “Joint Sea.” In
July of this year, two Russian Tu-95 long-range bombers
flew with two Chinese H-6 bombers from the Sea of Japan
to the East China Sea. Russia and China called this joint
flight the “first Russia-China joint air patrol” conducted
in line with the annual military cooperation plan between
the two countries.[37] This indicates progress in the military
cooperation between Russia and China.
In 2018, Russia concluded agreements to supply India
with new armaments such as the S-400 surface-to-air missile
system and Admiral Grigorovich-class frigates. The two
countries have completed joint development of the “BrahMos”


**Chapter**


32 The Foreign Policy Concept of the Russian Federation (November 2016).
33 The National Security Strategy of the Russian Federation (December 2015) states that, “With a view to protecting its national interests Russia is pursuing an open, rational, and pragmatic
foreign policy ruling out futile confrontation (including a new arms race). (Abridged) The Russian Federation’s objective is to acquire as many equal partners as possible in various parts of
the world.”

34 In October 2011, eight CIS countries (Russia, Belarus, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Tajikistan, Ukraine, Moldova, and Armenia) signed the CIS Free Trade Zone Agreement.
35 The Foreign Policy Concept of the Russian Federation (released in November 2016). Under this policy, Russia has participated in various frameworks in the Asia-Pacific region. Since 2015,
the Eastern Economic Forum has been held in Vladivostok for accelerating the economic development of Eastern Russia and expanding international cooperation with the Asia-Pacific
region. In addition, Russia has participated in regional frameworks, such as the Asia Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC), the ASEAN Regional Forum (ARF), the Shanghai Cooperation
Organization (SCO), and the East Asia Summit (EAS; since 2011).

36 The National Security Strategy of the Russian Federation (December 2015) states that, “The Russian Federation will develop its comprehensive partnership relationship and strategic
cooperative relationship with the People’s Republic of China as a key factor for maintaining global and regional stability. The Russian Federation will assign an important role to the
privileged strategic partnership with the Republic of India.”

37 According to Russian reports, on July 23, Lieutenant-General Kobylash, commander of Russia’s Long-Range Aviation held a briefing on the joint air patrol on the same day, and announced
that the air group composed of two Tu-95MS bombers of Russia’s Long-Range Aviation and two Chinese H-6 bombers, had flown along a pre-planned route over neutral waters of the Sea
of Japan and the East China Sea. The commander also stated that the flight was performed in line with the international military cooperation plan of the Armed Forces of the Russian

supersonic cruise missile and are now jointly developing the
hypersonic cruise missile “BrahMos-II.”[38] Another example
of the ongoing wide-ranging military cooperation between
Russia and India is the joint exercise “INDRA,” which has
been taking place since 2003 with the involvement of the
armies and navies of both countries, with their air forces also
taking part in recent years. Regarding the relationship with
Japan, Russia states that it will develop mutually beneficial
cooperation and is intensifying its approach in many fields
including politics, economy and security.

3 Situation in Ukraine


As antagonism between Ukraine and Russia has continued
since 2014, Ukraine has shifted away from non-alignment
policy that Ukraine once held and is pursuing efforts to join
NATO. In March 2018, then President Petro Poroshenko
stated that Ukraine would participate in a NATO Membership
Action Plan (MAP).[39] Sporadic clashes between Ukrainian
troops and separatist armed forces continue in the eastern part
of the country, with over 10,000 people reported to have died
since April 2014. Furthermore, the political processes set out
in the Minsk agreements seem to have stalled, including the
holding of local elections and allowing more autonomy in
the areas controlled by separatists. The unstable situation
in eastern Ukraine and the Russian “annexation” of Crimea
have taken on aspect of being entrenched.
In November 2018, there was an incident in which the
Coast Guard of the Border Service of Russia seized three
Ukrainian naval vessels near the Kerch Strait, a channel —
over which Russia has built a bridge to provide an overland
link between the Crimean Peninsula and mainland Russia
— connecting the Black Sea and the Sea of Azov. Ukraine
declared martial law in response to this incident. While
then President Poroshenko criticized the move as a Russian
attempt to take possession of the Sea of Azov, following on
from its seizure of Crimea and eastern Ukraine, President
Putin hit back, calling the response a provocation aimed at
increasing popular support immediately before the Ukrainian
presidential election.


and Khmeimim Air Base as bases of its operations in Syria,
the Russian military has conducted aerial bombing using
fighter-bombers and long-range bombers as well as red cruise
missiles from surface vessels and submarines deployed to
the Caspian Sea and Mediterranean. In December 2016, a
nationwide ceasefire agreement brokered by Russia and
Turkey took effect between the Assad administration and
opposition forces. While Russia has continued to fight ISIL
and Hay’at Tahrir al-Sham (HTS; formerly the “al-Nusra
Front”) since January 2017, it has also held Syrian peace
talks in Astana, Kazakhstan together with Syria and Iran.
Russia has been increasing its presence in the Middle East
by promoting initiatives that aim for political resolutions in
the future.
In December 2017, President Putin visited a base in
Syria, where he announced that the fight against terrorism
in the country had been largely resolved, that Russia would
continue to operate two permanent bases within Syria, and
that he had decided that most of the Russian forces in Syria
would be redeployed back to Russia.[40]

Russia is working to bolster its naval forces and enhance
their cooperation with its air force in Syria. For instance, in
September 2018, Russia mustered 26 naval vessels from the
Northern Fleet, Baltic Fleet, Black Sea Fleet and Caspian
Flotilla in the eastern Mediterranean off Syria and held the
first major joint exercise involving the navy and air force,
in which 34 aircraft — including strategic bombers — took
part.

See Chapter 3, Section 7 (Trends in International Terrorism and
Regional Conflicts)


**Chapter**


The objectives of Russian military intervention may
include: (1) to sustain the Assad administration which
is friendly to Russia; (2) to defend Russian interests
including its military bases in Syria; (3) to address the
threat of international terrorist organizations including
ISIL; and (4) to secure influence in the Middle East. Thus
far, Russia seems to have contributed to the recovery of
the Assad administration’s areas of control and protecting
Russian interests. Additionally, operations in Syria using
cruise missiles and strategic bombers have provided the
ideal setting to demonstrate Russia’s long-range precision
strike capabilities. Considering the significant influence of

38 Aside from this cooperation, it has been noted that India is considering the lease of another nuclear-powered attack submarine to replace the Akula-class nuclear-powered attack
submarine that it began leasing from Russia in 2012.

39 The NATO MAP is a NATO program to offer advice and support to countries wishing to join NATO. However, participation in a MAP does not mean that the country will decide to participate
in NATO in the future.

40 In December 2017, at an Expanded Meeting of the Defence Ministry Board, it was announced that since the start of its military operation in Syria, Russian air units have launched
approximately 34,000 strikes, damaging or eliminating approximately 8,000 armored vehicles, 718 weapons and ammunition production facilities, and 60,318 combatants. At the
December 2018 Expanded Meeting of the Defence Ministry Board, it was announced that armaments not included in the reorganization of the Knmeimim and Tartus bases had been

Russia s military intervention on the course of the Assad
administration, coupled with the expanding partnerships
between Russia and surrounding countries such as Turkey
and Iran, Russia’s influence on future stability in Syria and
on the political settlement process cannot be neglected.

5 Relations with Commonwealth of Independent States


Russia positions the development of bilateral and multilateral
cooperation with the CIS as one of its most important foreign
policy objectives. Russia considers that its vital interests
are concentrated in the territories of the CIS, and deploys
its troops in Ukraine (Crimea), Moldova (Transnistria[41]),
Armenia, Tajikistan, Kyrgyzstan, and Georgia (South
Ossetia, Abkhazia), which withdrew from the CIS in August
2009.[42] Through the conclusion of an alliance and strategic
partnership treaty with Abkhazia in November 2014, the
conclusion of an alliance with South Ossetia in 2015, and
other efforts,[43] Russia has been working to ensure its military
influence.[44]

Due to increasing activities by Islamic armed insurgents
in Central Asia and the Caucasus, Russia has been pursuing
military cooperation primarily on counterterrorism
measures in the region, and organized the Collective Rapid
Deployment Force in May 2001 within the framework of
the CIS Collective Security Treaty Organization (CSTO).[45]
Furthermore, in June 2009, a permanent joint rapid reaction
force was established to strengthen the functions of the CIS
Collective Rapid Deployment Force.[46]

President Putin once remarked, “The collapse of the
Soviet Union was a major geopolitical disaster of the 20th

century,” and he has been working to unify and strengthen


the sphere of the former Soviet Union through such as
the Commonwealth of Independent States (CIS), the CIS
Collective Security Treaty Organization (CSTO), and the
creation of the Eurasian Economic Union in 2015.
In addition, out of concern that the worsening security in
Afghanistan could lead to the destabilization of Central Asia,
Russia and Central Asian countries support Afghanistan
while considering measures to strengthen the security of the
Afghan border.[47]

6 Relations with the United States


President Putin has striven to deepen cooperative relations
with the United States in the economic domain, while
opposing the United States on any action Russia considers as
“a U.S. attempt to encroach on Russia’s strategic interests.”
Feeling that the United States’ installation of missile
defense systems both at home and abroad — including in
Europe and the Asia-Pacific — undermines global and
regional security, Russia has criticized these moves for
upsetting the strategic balance. Russia is also moving forward
with the development of new strategic weapons that are said
to be capable of reliably penetrating missile defense systems.
While expressing concerns about preemptive and spacebased missile defense in response to the MDR published by
the United States in January 2019, Russia stated that dialogue
between the two countries needed to resume.
However, following Russia’s actions in connection
with the situation in Ukraine, the United States announced
suspension of the military exchanges with Russia in March
2014.[48] In addition, the United States dispatched a missile

destroyer to the Black Sea and provided nonlethal weapons


**Chapter**


41 In Transnistria, located on the eastern side of the Dniester River, ethnic Russian residents declared separation and independence from Moldova in 1990, but it was never recognized as
such by the international community. Following the “annexation” of Crimea into Russia, in March 2014 the “Parliament” of Transnistria urged Russia to also incorporate the region.
Moreover, during a telephone conference between President Putin and then President Barack Obama in March 2014, President Putin pointed out that Transnistria was experiencing a
blockade. A Russian unit of approximately 1,500 troops is currently stationed in Transnistria.

42 After the conflict with Russia in August 2008, Georgia withdrew from the CIS in August 2009, but Russia unilaterally recognized the independence of South Ossetia and Abkhazia in the
Georgian territory and continues to have troops stationed in the regions.

43 Russia’s “Military Doctrine” revised in December 2014 states that Russia would promote cooperation with the Republic of Abkhazia and the Republic of South Ossetia aimed at shared
defense and security.

44 While some CIS countries continue to prioritize their relations with Russia, such as Belarus and Kazakhstan, others attempt to maintain a distance from Russia. In addition to Georgia which
has already withdrawn from CIS and Ukraine which is announcing plans to withdrawal, countries such as Azerbaijan and Moldova have taken mostly pro-Western policies to reduce their
security and economic dependence on Russia. In September 2012, Kyrgyzstan and Russia agreed on a 15-year extension of the period of the use of Russian military bases in Kyrgyzstan,
which otherwise would end in 2017. In October 2012, Tajikistan and Russia agreed to extend the lease of the base of Russia’s 201st Motor Rifle Division in Tajikistan until 2042. In
December 2013, Su-27 fighters of the Russian naval force were deployed in Belarus for the first time.

45 In May 1992, leaders of six countries (Armenia, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Russia, Tajikistan, and Uzbekistan) signed the Collective Security Treaty (CST) in Toshkent, Uzbekistan. In 1993,
Azerbaijan, Georgia and Belarus joined the treaty, which came into effect in April 1994. However, Azerbaijan, Georgia, and Uzbekistan withdrew from the treaty in 1999 without renewing it.
In May 2002, CST was reorganized into the CSTO. Uzbekistan returned to CST in August 2006 but gave notice to suspend its participation in CSTO in June 2012, effectively withdrawing
from the organization.

46 Learning from the fact that CSTO could not sufficiently respond to the request by Kyrgyzstan for the peace-keeping activities at the time of the ethnic conflict in the southern part of
Kyrgyzstan in June 2010, CSTO has been discussing improvement in the efficiency of its crisis response system. The CSTO Summit Meeting in December 2011 warned against the foreign
forces’ stationing in a member state by requiring the consent of all member states when any member state builds a base of a third country. CSTO joint exercises, Vzaimodeistvie
(cooperative operation), has been implemented every year since 2009.

47 In February 2018, Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov stated that the ISIL presence in northern and eastern Afghanistan had become serious, with thousands of combatants active there.
However, the U.S. commander of the NATO mission stationed in the country to train Afghan security units said that Russia was exaggerating the ISIL threat to justify its provision of military
assistance to the Taliban.

48 Following the occupation of the Crimean Peninsula by Russia, then U.S. DoD Spokesperson Kirby announced in March 2014 that the United States would cease all military exchange with

to the Ukrainian Government.[49]

In regard to the situation in Syria, there were some
positive developments, including the recognition of the
importance of U.S.-Russia cooperation to eliminate ISIL, a
U.N.-led political resolution to the conflict, and provisional
safe zones as shown in a joint statement released at the U.S.Russia Summit Meeting held in November 2017. However,
antagonism between the two countries has continued, with
both the United States and Russia criticizing each other
over the alleged use of chemical weapons by the Assad
regime in April 2017, and also the missile strikes against
Syria by the United States, the United Kingdom, and France
in April 2018. At the U.S.-Russia summit meeting held in
July 2018, disarmament issues as well as international
affairs including North Korea and Syria were discussed
based on the recognition of a need to improve U.S.-Russia
relations, which have deteriorated. At the U.S.-Russia
foreign ministers’ meeting held in May 2019, both countries
expressed their interest in having many more opportunities
for conversation on arms control and multiple strategic
security issues between the two countries. Furthermore, at the
U.S.-Russia summit meeting held in June 2019, the leaders
agreed to continue discussion on a “21st century model of
arms control.” Although a U.S.-Russia deputy-ministerial
strategic security dialogue was held in July of the same year,
no concrete result was confirmed.

Regional Conflict)


meetings.[50] Additionally, NATO and European countries
have maintained a severe diplomatic stance towards Russia
while working together with the Ukrainian Government.
At the NRC summit held in Lisbon in November 2010 prior
to the suspension of working level cooperation, Russia and
NATO would work towards building a true and modernized
strategic partnership. They have continued searching for
possibilities of dialogue and cooperation in fields such as
MD, Afghanistan, cooperation on counterterrorism, and
anti-piracy measures. With regard to MD cooperation, no
progress was made on Russia-NATO relations. For example,
the talks at the meeting of NR defense ministers held in June
2011 highlighted the difference in position between NATO
advocating MD cooperation in which only information and
data would be exchanged under the two independent systems
of NATO and Russia, and Russia aiming at “sector MD” in
which both sides operate integrally by setting zones for each
country’s responsibility under a unified MD system of NATO
and Russia.
Meanwhile, there remains an unsolved issue between
Russia and NATO regarding the Conventional Armed Forces
in Europe (CFE) agreement.[51]

Furthermore, the Ukrainian crisis has represented existing
threat to NATO’s eastern border for the first time since the
Cold War. Consequently, some of NATO’s member states
in Eastern Europe and the Baltic harbor national security
concerns. For this and other reasons, NATO continues to take
steps to ensure the effectiveness of its collective defense.[52]

Russia revealed that it has deployed two army divisions
near the border with Ukraine, and one army division near
its border with Belarus, and Russia conducted the strategic
command and staff exercise Zapad 2017 in its Western
Military District and Belarus in September 2017.[53] That
exercise was brought up at the NATO-Russia Council
meeting held in October of that same year, where it was
pointed out that the number of actually participating soldiers
and the area used for the exercise were larger than indicated
in the announcement made by Russia prior to the exercise.
However, there were no invasions into other countries by
Russia, and no Russian units stayed in Belarus following the


**Chapter**


7 Relations with Europe and NATO


Through the framework of the NATO-Russia Council
(NRC), Russia has worked with NATO as an equal partner
in the areas of common interest, such as by participating in
certain decision-making processes. However, following the
Ukrainian crisis, NATO and European countries suspended
their practical cooperation with Russia, including that in the
military domain, except for the NRC’s ambassador-level


49 The United States provided non-lethal weapons such as body armor, helmets, vehicles, night and thermal vision devices, heavy engineering equipment, advanced radios, patrol boats,
rations, tents, counter mortar radars, uniforms, first aid equipment, and other related items to Ukraine. In March 2018, following the U.S. State Department’s announcement to Congress
that it had approved the sale of anti-tank missiles to Ukraine, the Russian Foreign Ministry attacked the decision, stating that the sale of the missiles would not resolve the conflict in
Ukraine.

50 NATO issued a statement condemning Russia over the situation in Ukraine, and has deployed additional military forces to countries in Eastern Europe and the Baltic. However, there are
discrepancies among NATO’s member states in their responses to Russia.

51 At the 1999 Istanbul summit of the OSCE, an agreement was reached on changing the troop ceilings set formerly by blocks to those set by country and territory and on complying with the
current CFE Treaty until the adapted CFE Treaty comes into effect. Russia was dissatisfied with the fact that despite its ratification of the adapted CFE Treaty, NATO member states refused
to ratify the Treaty on the grounds that the RAF were not withdrawing from Georgia and Moldova. Therefore, in December 2007, Russia suspended the implementation of the CFE Treaty
and halted inspections based on this treaty. Presently, only four countries have ratified the adapted CFE Treaty—Russia, Belarus, Kazakhstan, and Ukraine—and it has not yet come into
effect. In addition, Russia has proposed dissolving the existing security framework that has NATO at its center and creating a new European security treaty that would provide new
fundamental principles for security in Europe and the Atlantic region.

exercise, which were points of concern.
Russia’s Foreign Policy Concept announced in November
2016 states that containment policies of the United States
and its allies undermine regional and global stability, and
Russia would maintain its negative perspective towards
NATO expansion. In December 2018, Minister of Defence
Sergei Shoigu stated that the establishment of NATO’s new
headquarters would enable units to be deployed more rapidly
from the United States to Europe and within Europe to areas
close to Russia’s border, and that NATO was beefi ng up its
military capacity, with members in the process of achieving
the goal of dedicating 2% of GDP to defense spending.
The minister then emphasized that Russia was prepared to
counter both current and future threats with its modern, agile,
compact and effective military.

8 Exportation of Arms


Russia seems to actively promote the export of arms not only
to maintain the infrastructure of its military industry and to
make economic profi t, but also to help promote better foreign


policy. The country s export value has been increasing in
recent years.[54] In January 2007, the Russian Government
granted the exclusive authority to export arms to the
Rosoboron Export State Corporation as part of its ongoing
initiatives to improve its export system. In addition, Russia
regards its military industry as an integral part of the nation’s
military organization and is committed to improving and
further developing the military industry by such measures
as promoting the integration of aircraft companies such as
Sukhoi, MiG, and Tupolev.
Russia exports equipment such as fi ghters and vessels to
countries including India, China, Algeria, ASEAN member
states, and Venezuela.[55] Russia concluded an agreement with
China to sell new Su-35 fi ghters and the S-400 surface-toair missile system. All the 24 Su-35 fi ghters[56] agreed on had
been delivered by 2018, with the fi rst delivery of the S-400
reportedly due to take place that year. It has been pointed
out that this deal was made possible because the interests
of China and Russia coincided: while China promotes
indigenous weapons production, it still needs Russian
technology for state-of-the-art equipment, whereas Russia
aims to avoid diplomatic isolation caused by the Ukrainian
crisis and to gain economic profi t through arms exports.[57]

In recent years, Russia has been aggressively marketing
its arms to allies and partners of the United States, including
Turkey and Saudi Arabia, in addition to traditional export
destinations. In particular, the export of S-400 to Turkey,[58]
a member country of NATO, has met with strong opposition
from the United States.

Commissioned in 1990, it is currently the only aircraft
carrier that the Russian Navy possesses. Carrier-based
aircraft take off by the ski jump method. Scheduled to
begin refurbishment in 2021.


54 According to SIPRI, Russian arms exports between 2014 and 2018 decreased by 17% compared to that of the period between 2009 and 2013. Russia has the second largest share of arms
exports in the world (21%) after the United States.

55 Russia has delivered to Indonesia 5 Su-27 fi ghters and 11 Su-30 fi ghters. Furthermore, it was reported in 2016 that Russia signed an agreement to sell 11 Su-35 fi ghters to Indonesia. To
date, Russia has delivered 18 Su-30 fi ghters to Malaysia and 12 Su-27 fi ghters and 36 Su-30 fi ghters to Vietnam. There are also reports of a sales contract with Vietnam for Kilo-class
submarines. All six of these submarines were delivered to Vietnam by January 2017. With regard to India, aircraft carrier Admiral Gorshkov, which had been refurbished in Russia, was
delivered to India, renamed as INS Vikramaditya in November 2013, which arrived in India in January 2014. Moreover, to date, Russia has delivered to Algeria 52 Su-30 fi ghters and to
Venezuela 24 Su-30 fi ghters. Russia’s exports to China have included Su-27 and Su-30 fi ghters, Sovremenny-class destroyers, and Kilo-class submarines. Against the backdrop of the
advancement of indigenous weapon production in China, some point out that the value of Russian exports to China has been declining in recent years. Nevertheless, Russia has continued
to export equipment such as aircraft engines for repair purposes. With regard to Iran, Russia started exporting the “S-300” surface-to-air missile system in April 2016. Russia plans to
supply the S-400 system to India, in addition to China and Turkey, and is believed to be engaged in ongoing discussions concerning an agreement to supply the system to Saudi Arabia, as
well.

56 According to reports, contracts have been concluded to export 24 Su-35 fi ghter jets for approximately USD 2 billion and to export 32 S-400 missile launchers for approximately USD 3
billion.

57 In September 2015, President Putin responded in an interview with news agencies that, “Russian-Chinese ties have now probably reached a peak in their entire history and continue
developing.”

58 Russia and Turkey made an export contract for S-400 in 2017. The fi rst delivery of the S-400 was reportedly completed in July 2019. In particular, regarding the export of S-400 to Turkey,
a member country of NATO, the United States expressed concern that some intelligence on the F-35 would leak to Russia via S-400, as a result of which, Turkey was unable to participate

a blueprint for national security over the next decade,
presenting the recognition that responding to the economic
and strategic changes in the Asia-Pacific region is vital to
the national security of Australia. The Strategy defines four
objectives for the country’s national security: (1) to ensure
a safe and resilient population; (2) to protect and strengthen
Australia’s sovereignty; (3) to secure Australia’s assets,
infrastructure and institutions; and (4) to promote a favorable
international environment. On this basis, the Strategy outlines
the following priorities for the next five years: (1) enhanced
engagement in the Asia-Pacific region;[2] (2) integrated cyber
policy and operations;[3] and (3) effective partnerships.[4]

The Defence White Paper released in February 2016
presents[5] an outlook of Australia’s security environment
over the next two decades. It then outlines the direction of
Australia’s defense strategy for dealing with this environment,
and the development of the defense force pursuant to this
strategy.
Specifically, the white paper maintains that while there
is little prospect of a military attack on Australian territory
in the period to 2035,[6] Australia will face new complexities
and challenges. Based on this understanding, three strategic
defense interests are identified, namely: a secure, resilient
Australia (including the security of sea lanes); a secure
nearer region; and a stable Indo-Pacific region and a rulesbased global order. Additionally, the following three strategic
defense objectives are given: (1) Deter, deny, and defeat
attacks on or threats to Australia and its national interests;
(2) Make military contributions to support the security
of maritime Southeast Asia and support the governments
of Pacific Island countries to build and strengthen their
security; and (3) Contribute military capabilities to coalition
operations that support Australia’s interests in a rules-based
global order. To maintain the ADF’s high level of capability


1 General Situation


Australia maintains a special strategic partnership with
Japan and shares universal values, such as strategic interests,
respect for freedom and human rights, and democracy. It is
allied with the United States, as are Japan and the ROK.
The Defence White Paper released in February 2016
states that over the next two decades, the Australian
Government will make important investments to maintain
the high level of capability of the Australian Defence Force
(ADF), setting out a plan to continue to increase the troop
strength and acquire high performance equipment. The
white paper states explicitly that defense funding would be
increased over the next decade, setting a specific target of
2% of Australia’s GDP to be reached by 2020. With regard
to Australia’s international relationships, the white paper sets
forth that Australia would aim to mature and deepen practical
engagement with partners across the Indo-Pacific, including
Japan, while continuing to give highest priority to its alliance
with the United States. To achieve its strategic defense
objective of contributing military capabilities to coalition
operations that support Australia’s interests in a rules-based
global order, Australia makes proactive contributions to the
peace and stability of the international community through
the deployment of ADF to overseas operations, among other
efforts. On May 18, 2019, a general election took place, and
the ruling conservative coalition (Liberal Party and National
Party) gained a victory.

2 Security and Defense Policies


The Australian Government launched its first National
Security Strategy in January 2013.[1] The Strategy provides


**Chapter**


This strategy is based on the National Security Statement, announced in December 2008, which articulated Australia’s national security agenda and set in motion reforms to strengthen the
National Security Community.

Specifically, this includes: (1) deepening the Australia-U.S. Alliance; )2) enhancing bilateral cooperation with influential regional countries such as China, Indonesia, Japan, the ROK, and
India; and (3) promoting the superiority and effectiveness of multilateral forums.

The Australian Cyber Security Centre (ACSC) integrates the capabilities of Australia’s Department of Defence, Attorney-General’s Department, and Federal Police and the cyber-related
personnel of the Australian Crime Commission.

This includes sharing information securely and quickly with domestic and international partners and strengthening information sharing between government and business.

The Defence White Paper of Australia presents the government’s future plan and measures for national defense. It was previously published in 1976 (Fraser Liberal Party administration),
1987 (Hawke Labor Party administration), 1994 (Keating Labor Party administration), 2000 (Howard Liberal Party administration), 2009 (Rudd Labor Party administration), 2013 (Gillard
Labor Party administration), and 2016 (Turnbull Liberal Party administration) a total of seven times.

The white paper identifies six factors that will shape the security environment of Australia over the next two decades: (1) the roles of the United States and China in the Indo-Pacific region
and the relationship between them; (2) challenges to the stability of the rules-based global order; (3) the threat of terrorism to Australians at home and abroad; (4) state fragility caused by
uneven economic growth, crime, social, environmental and governance challenges, and climate change; (5) the pace of military modernization and the development of more capable
regional military forces; and (6) the emergence of new complex, non-geographic threats (e.g., cyber threats). With regard to (5), the white paper notes that in the Indo-Pacific region, half of
th ld’ b i d t l t h lf f th ld’ d d b t i ft ill b ti d t i i b lli ti i il t h l

needed to achieve these objectives, the Government will
make important investments. In addition to increasing the
troop strength by approximately 4,400 personnel,[7] Australia
will acquire high performance equipment, including 12 new
submarines,[8] 3 air warfare destroyers (Aegis vessels), 72
F-35 Joint Strike Fighters, and 7 MQ4C unmanned patrol
aircraft. Simultaneously, Australia will seek to strengthen
intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance (ISR)
capabilities, electronic warfare capabilities, and cybersecurity
capabilities, as well as strengthen the functions of its bases in
northern Australia and elsewhere. To support these programs
by funding, the white paper also presents the concrete target
of increasing defense funding to reach 2% of GDP by 2020.
In addition, with North Korea continuing to make repeated,
provocative actions unlike any seen in the past, then Prime
Minister Turnbull announced in October 2017 that Australia
would be equipping nine of the future frigates of the Royal
Australian Navy with a ballistic missile defense system
(the Aegis system), stating, “A number of states, notably of
course, North Korea, are developing missiles with advanced
range and speed. We must have the capability to meet and
defeat them.”[9]

3 Relations with Other Countries


In the Defence White Paper 2016, Australia subscribed to
the view that Australia’s security and prosperity are directly
linked to the development of the nearer region, the IndoPacific region, and the global strategic environment. Based
on this view, Australia will build and maintain international
security relationships to achieve its strategic defense
objectives. In particular, Australia will aim to mature and
deepen practical engagement with partners across the Indo

Pacific region, including Indonesia, Japan, the ROK, New
Zealand, India, and China, while continuing to give the
highest priority to its alliance with the United States. On
November 2017, Australia published the 2017 Foreign
Policy White Paper for the first time in 14 years.[10]

See Part III, Chapter 3, Section 1-2-1 (Australia)


See


**(1) Relations with the United States**

In the Defence White Paper 2016, Australia states that its
alliance with the United States pursuant to the Security
Treaty between Australia, New Zealand and the United States
of America (ANZUS)[11] is based on shared values and will
continue to be the centerpiece of Australia’s defense policy.
Australia notes that the United States, which remains the preeminent global military power over the next two decades,
will continue to be its most important strategic partner, and
the active presence of the United States will continue to
underpin the stability of the region. It is stated that Australia
thus welcomes and supports the critical role of the United
States in ensuring stability in the Indo-Pacific region.
Since 1985, the two countries have been regularly convening
the Australia-United States Ministerial Consultations
(AUSMIN) to discuss major diplomatic and security issues.
On the operational front, the two countries have made efforts
to increase interoperability through joint exercises, including
Exercise Talisman Saber.[12] Since April 2012, the U.S. Marine
Corps have conducted rotational deployments to northern
Australia.[13] On the equipment front, the two countries have
been simplifying the export procedures associated with
equipment deals pursuant to the Australia-U.S. Defence

Trade Cooperation Treaty that entered into force in May
2013. In addition, the two countries are considering the joint


**Chapter**


7 According to the white paper, over the next decade, the number of active duty ADF personnel would be increased to approximately 62,400 personnel from the current approximately 58,000
personnel. If this is realized, the ADF would return to its largest size since 1993.

8 The Defence White Paper refers to the submarines to be acquired as “regionally superior submarines.” It explains that Australia would select the submarine classification by the end of
2016, and that the first submarine would begin entering service in the early 2030s. Japan, Germany, and France participated in the submarine Competitive Evaluation Process. In April
2016, the Australian Government announced that the French company DCNS was chosen as the partner for building the submarines. In August 2016, it was found that confidential DCNS
documents on its submarine order for the Indian Navy had leaked, resulting in rising calls in Australia for a review of the deal. Prime Minister Turnbull emphasized that the submarines
being built for Australia are a different type than the one leaked, refuting the need for a review.

9 Following statements made by then Foreign Minister Bishop in April 2017 to the effect that “the United States Administration did say that all options are on the table” and suggesting that
Australia supports this. In regard to North Korea, a spokesperson for the North Korean Foreign Ministry criticized Australia, saying, “If Australia persists in following the US' moves to isolate
and stifle North Korea … this will be a suicidal act of coming within the range of the nuclear strike of the strategic force of North Korea.”

10 The 2017 Foreign Policy White Paper recognizes that it is in the national interest of China to increase its influence, and concludes that there are instances in which Chinese influence is
indeed greater than U.S. influence in parts of the Indo-Pacific. Beyond that, it points out that Australia will expand strategic relations with democratic states that share similar aspirations
with Australia, while also ensuring the deepening of the Australia-U.S. Alliance. The White Paper also emphasizes that Australia will strengthen relationships, keeping in mind the “quad”
states (Japan-U.S.-India-Australia) with the aim of ensuring stability and growth from Asia to Africa in particular.

11 A trilateral security treaty among Australia, New Zealand, and the United States, which went into effect in 1952. Since 1986, the United States has suspended its obligation to defend New
Zealand due to its adoption of a non-nuclear policy. The treaty is thus effective only between Australia and the United States and between Australia and New Zealand.

12 Exercise Talisman Saber, started in 2005, is a biennial combined U.S.-Australia training exercise designed to improve combat readiness and interoperability. About 33,000 U.S. Forces and
ADF personnel participated in the exercise held from June to July 2017. Japan Ground Self-Defense Force (JGSDF) also participated in this exercise in 2015 and 2017, strengthening its
relationships with the United States and Australian forces.

13 By way of the Force Posture Initiatives of November 2011, the United States and Australia announced that the U.S. Marine Corps would conduct rotational deployments approximately every
six months to Darwin and northern Australia. Accordingly, approximately 200 U.S. Marines were deployed in 2012 and 2013, 1,150 Marines in 2014 and 2015, approximately 1,250
Marines in 2016 and 2017, approximately 1,600 Marines in 2018, and approximately 2,500 Marines in 2019. The Defence White Paper 2016 set out that the size would be increased to
approximately 2,500 Marines by 2020. In addition, under this same initiative, access to Australian military facilities and areas in northern Australia by U.S. Air Force aircraft was set to be

development of the F-35 and missile defense cooperation.[14]
Furthermore, bilateral cooperation is being advanced in areas
such as ISR, space,[15] and cyber.[16] In August 2014, the two
sides signed the Force Posture Agreement which provides a
legal framework for the rotational deployment of the U.S.
Marine Corps. From October 2014, the ADF participated in
the combat mission of the U.S.-led operation against ISIL.
In July 2015, the two countries conducted training in which
B-52 strategic bombers of the U.S. Forces were flown from
the U.S. mainland to drop bombs on an air weapons range in
Australia and then returned to the United States.
Under the Turnbull administration, at the AUSMIN in
October 2015, the two sides signed a joint statement on
defense cooperation[17] to serve as a guideline for future defense
cooperation, and reaffirmed their strong bilateral cooperation.
In their joint statement at the AUSMIN held in July 2018, the
United States and Australia made their commitment to work
together to shape an “Indo-Pacific that is open, inclusive,
prosperous, and rules-based,” welcomed the recent U.S.Australia-India-Japan consultations on the Indo-Pacific,
reaffirmed their commitment to strengthen trilateral dialogue
with Japan, and highlighted their commitment to raising
the number of Marines rotating to the full complement of
2,500 as soon as practicable, the achievement of which was
announced in the AUSMIN in July 2019. At the AUSMIN
2019, serious concerns about continued militarization in
the South China Sea and the Pacific were also expressed. In
addition, both sides emphasized the importance of AustraliaU.S. defense cooperation in the Indo-Pacific region,
indicating the policy to deepen cooperation with Japan, India,
the United Kingdom, France, Germany and other countries.
Furthermore, they committed to further support Southeast
Asian and the Pacific Island countries, and cooperation to


maintain pressure on North Korea.

**(2) Relations with China**

In the Defence White Paper 2016, Australia states that its
relationship with China is crucial in different ways from its
relationship with the United States, and that it welcomes
China’s continued economic growth and the opportunities
bringing for Australia and other countries in the Indo-Pacific.
It goes on to say Australia is committed to continuing the
development of Australia’s defense relations with China,
and working to enhance mutual understanding, facilitate
transparency, and build trust.
Based on such policy, Australia and China continuously
hold dialogues among their defense authorities,[18] along with
exchanges to develop the cooperative relations between their
defense forces, including joint exercises and mutual visits by
vessels.[19]

Meanwhile, Australia has been showing its wariness
toward China, by, among other ways, making Australia’s
position on China very clear.
The Australian government expressed strong concerns over
China’s recent land reclamation and construction activity in
the South China Sea, and called on all claimant states to halt
militarization, while also clearly expressing its intention to
continue to exercise its rights to free navigation and flight.[20]

Furthermore, the 2017 Foreign Policy White Paper contained
statements to the effect that China is challenging the position
of the United States in the Indo-Pacific, the most important
region for Australia.
People within and outside Australia expressed their
concerns over the acquisition by Chinese businesses of

Australian facilities, including Port Darwin, a port that has
been used by Australian and the United States fleets among


**Chapter**


14 While Australia considers that the threat of an ICBM attack on Australia is low, it deems there is a possible threat of an attack on Australian territory by a long-range or submarine-launched
ballistic missile or cruise missile, as well as attack on the deployed ADF by a short-range ballistic missile or cruise missile. To counter such threats, Australia and the United States have
launched a working group to study options that could contribute to missile defense in the region.

15 Since signing the Space Situational Awareness Partnership in November 2010, Australia and the United States have promoted space cooperation, including the relocation of the U.S. C-band
ground-based radar system and the Space Surveillance Telescope to Australia.

16 At the AUSMIN in September 2011, the two nations signed a joint statement on cyberspace and confirmed that, mindful of their longstanding defense relationship and the ANZUS Treaty, the
two would consult together and determine appropriate options to address threats in the event of a cyber attack that threatens the territorial integrity, political independence, or security of
either Australia or the United States.

17 The statement envisions that greater competition for resources and territorial disputes will increase the possibility of miscalculation and the potential for conflict in the Asia-Pacific and
Indian Ocean regions, and states that the two countries would further deepen their defense relationship to deal with this. Specifically, the statement sets forth the following: deeper
interoperability; strengthened policy and intelligence cooperation; increased collaboration in science and technology, capability development, and defense industry engagement; and
coordinated multilateral engagement.

18 Australia and China have regularly convened a Defence Strategic Dialogue since 1997. At the 21st Dialogue held in October 2018, Secretary of the Department of Defence Greg Moriarty
and Chief of the Defence Force Angus Campbell visited China and had a meeting with Chief of the Joint Staff Department of the Central Military Commission Li Zuocheng.

19 With an aim to build teamwork, goodwill, and trust between the Australian and Chinese forces, Australia annually conducts Exercise Pandaroo (since 2015) and KOWARI, survival training
among the United States, China, and Australia (since 2014). In August and September 2018, PLA Navy vessels joined multiple maritime exercise Kakadu for the first time. Also, in
September, Australian Navy vessels visited Zhanjiang, China for a joint cruising exercise with the PLA Navy.

20 In response to China’s announcement of the “East China Sea ADIZ” in November 2013, then Minister for Foreign Affairs Julie Bishop issued a statement saying Australia has made clear its
opposition to any coercive or unilateral actions to change the status quo in the East China Sea. The Joint Statement of the AUSMIN in October 2015, referring to China by name, expresses
strong concerns over recent land reclamation and construction activity in the South China Sea, and calls on all claimant states to halt militarization. When the United States conducted the
Freedom of Navigation Operation in the South China Sea in the same month, then Minister for Defence Marise Payne of Australia issued a statement expressing strong support for rights to
freedom of navigation and overflight under international law. In July 2016, then Minister for Foreign Affairs Bishop announced, with regard to the final ruling by the Arbitral Tribunal on the
case between the Philippines and China, that Australia would support the rights of all countries that resolve disputes peacefully following international law, including the UNCLOS, and that

others.[21] In January 2017, the federal government of Australia
announced the establishment of a dedicated center within
the Attorney General’s Department, which will identify
facilities requiring surveillance and carefully manage the
risks for advising related institutions in order to block the
sale of important infrastructure related to national security,
including specific ports and harbor facilities, to companies
from other countries.[22]

With China’s perceived influence on Australia growing
larger,[23] the Australian Parliament passed a bill to prevent
interference in domestic affairs by foreign actors.[24] The
Australian government announced the cancellation of
its contract on a submarine cable project with Chinese
telecommunication company Huawei and decided to let an
Australian company undertake the work with its support.[25]
Moreover, in August 2018, Huawei revealed that the company
and ZTE were banned from bidding in an Australian 5G
(advanced telecommunication system) network project by
the Australian government.[26]

**(3) Relations with India**

In the Defence White Paper 2016, Australia states that
it welcomes India’s increasingly active role in the IndoPacific region, and that it sees India as a key security partner.
Australia notes that it aims to further mature its defense
relationship with India in support of their shared strategic
interests.
The Australia-India relationship was elevated to a strategic
partnership in November 2009, and the two countries have
regularly conducted strategic dialogues, mutual visits by
senior military officers, interactions among military services,
and mutual dispatches of students to military educational
organizations. In November 2014, Prime Minister of India
Narendra Modi visited Australia, marking the first visit
to Australia by an Indian Prime Minister in 28 years. The


two leaders agreed to extend defense cooperation to cover
research, development, and industry engagement, to hold
regular meetings at the level of Defense Minister and conduct
regular maritime exercises, and to convene talks between
each of their military services. Since then, mutual exchanges
between Australia and India have steadily progressed through
such initiatives as mutual visits of naval ships and joint navy
training exercises.

**(4) Relations with Southeast Asia and Pacific Island Countries**

In the Defence White Paper 2016, Australia regards a secure
nearer region encompassing maritime Southeast Asia and
South Pacific as its strategic interest. In particular, Australia
considers that instability and conflicts in Southeast Asia have
the potential to threaten Australia’s security and economic
relations with countries. Furthermore, Australia depends
on maritime trade with Southeast Asian countries and
maritime trade that transits Southeast Asia. In this regard,
Australia perceives that the security of these sea lanes
must be ensured alongside freedom of navigation. Based
on this understanding, Australia seeks to make military
contributions to support the maritime security of Southeast
Asia and support the governments of Pacific Island and other
countries in building and strengthen their security.
Australia has been deepening its relations with Indonesia
in the security and defense fields following the signing of
the Lombok Treaty in November 2006, the elevation of their
relationship to a strategic partnership in March 2010, and
the conclusion of the Defence Cooperation Arrangement in
September 2012.[27] The two countries’ cooperative relations
in the security and defense fields have stalled intermittently.[28]
However, since mutual visits by ministers and higher-level


**Chapter**


21 Opposition parties and think tanks raised concerns over the fact that this Chinese company is thought to have close ties with the Communist Party of China and the PLA, and over the fact
that the U.S. Forces that utilize Port Darwin were not consulted in advance. According to press reports, then President Barack Obama requested then Prime Minister Turnbull to provide
advance notice. Additionally, the Chinese company in question is currently expressing interest in a port near Adelaide where future submarines are slated to be built, raising further
concerns.

22 The Government of Australia has struck down the acquisition of a farming company, S. Kidman & Co., which owns land equivalent to about 1% of Australia’s landmass and the acquisition
of major power company Ausgrid by Chinese companies due to reasons of national security. The established Critical Infrastructure Centre is viewed as supporting the Foreign Investment
Review Board (FIRB), which screens individual projects and advises the Government.

23 According to Australian media reporting, it is clear that China has meddled in domestic affairs through large-scale political contributions and bribes from at least five Chinese people.
24 The law requires the registration of the representatives of foreign governments or foreign companies doing lobbying activities in the Australian parliament, and imposes imprisonment in
the event that someone does make calls to action or influence the policymaking process without registering.

25 The Solomon Islands government and Chinese telecommunications giant Huawei once signed a deal to build an undersea communication cable between Australia and the Solomon Islands.
However, then Australian Prime Minister Turnbull announced in June 2018 that an Australian company would undertake the project instead to build cables among Australia, Papua New
Guinea, and the Solomon Islands.

26 On August 23, 2018, regarding 5G technology, the Government of Australia announced that companies that are likely to be subject to illegal directions from a foreign government were
posing a risk to national security. In the announcement, the Government of Australia did not cite the name of any country or company, and it stated that the announcement was not targeted
at any particular country.

27 The Lombok Treaty is a security cooperation framework that espouses wide-ranging cooperation in the defense field. It entered into force in February 2008. The Defense Cooperation
Arrangement covers strengthened cooperation in counter-terrorism and maritime security.

28 In November 2013, it was reported that an Australian intelligence agency wiretapped the telephone calls of Indonesia’s previous President Susilo Bambang Yudhoyono, Mrs. Yudhoyono,
ministers, and others. The Indonesian Government lodged strong protests, including summoning the Australian Ambassador to Indonesia and demanding an apology to the Australian
Government. The Government also announced the suspension of military exchanges and intelligence cooperation with Australia. In April 2015, two Australians were executed in Indonesia

officials resumed in the second half of 2015, the bilateral
relationship has been improving through many initiatives,
including regular Foreign and Defense Ministerial Meetings
(2+2) and the signing of an agreement on maritime security
and terrorism, and of a Maritime Cooperation Plan of Action
in 2018.
With Singapore and Malaysia, Australia carries out
regular joint combined exercises in the South China Sea and
other areas under the framework of the Five Power Defence
Arrangements.[29][, ] **[30] Australia considers that Singapore is**
its most advanced defense partner, and that they share
Australia’s interest in a secure maritime trading environment.
Defense cooperation is also deepening, including the signing
of a memorandum of understanding concerning military
training and training area development in Australia under
the comprehensive strategic partnership in October 2016.
As regards Malaysia, Australia stations the ADF in Royal
Malaysian Air Force (RMAF) Base Butterworth, and
contributes to maintaining regional security and stability
through patrol activities in the South China Sea and the
northern Indian Ocean.[.][31]

Australia plays a leading role in assisting Pacific Island
countries, and Timor-Leste in fields such as security
maintenance, coping with natural disasters, and maritime
patrol.[32] In particular, in the field of maritime patrol, Australia
still regularly deploys ADF assets to the South Pacific
to assist with patrol activities. In addition, in June 2014,
Australia unveiled a plan to replace the 22 patrol vessels it
provided to these countries in the past and add Timor-Leste
in the list of the recipient countries.[33] In November 2018,
Australia announced its largest ever financial package of up

to AUS$3 billion for infrastructure development in Pacific
Island countries, with the intent of further strengthening
relations. In May 2019, immediately after forming his
Cabinet following the general election, Prime Minister
Scott Morrison expressed his intention to continue active
engagement with the Pacific Island countries, called “Pacific
Step UP”. He made his first official trip overseas after the


cabinet forming to Solomon Islands in June 2019, showing
his stance of placing importance on the Pacific Island
countries.

**(5) Overseas Activities**

In the Defence White Paper 2016, Australia identifies the
following strategic defense objective to contribute military
capabilities to coalition operations that support Australia’s
interests in a rules-based global order. In line with this
objective, as of June 2019, about 2,400 of Australia’s
approximately 57,050 force strength[34] are deployed and are
conducting operations overseas.
Australia joined the airstrikes conducted by the U.S.
Forces against ISIL in northern Iraq in October 2014. Today,
it is engaged in advising and assisting, as well as providing
capacity building assistance to the Iraqi Security Forces on
the military front.[35]

In Afghanistan, since October 2001, approximately
1,550 ADF personnel on average have engaged annually
in reconstruction assistance activities and the training of
the Afghan National Security Forces (ANSF), under the
International Security Assistance Force (ISAF). After the
completion of ISAF’s activities in the end of 2014, about
300 ADF personnel now train, advise, and assist NATO-led
Afghan forces. The term of these activities has been extended
to the end of 2020.
Since 2018, the ADF engaged in patrolling and monitoring
activities against illegal maritime activities, including illicit
ship-to-ship transfers by North Korean ships, which is

prohibited under the UNSCR.


**Chapter**


29 See Chapter 2, Section 6, Footnote 4
30 In Exercise Bersama Shield held in April 2018, approximately 440 personnel, vessels and patrol aircraft of the ADF, participated. In October 2016, Exercise Bersama Lima was held in
Malaysia, Singapore and South China Sea in which approximately 750 personnel, vessels, and patrol aircraft of the ADF participated.

31 In December 2015, the Australian Department of Defence admitted that as part of these activities, Royal Australian Air Force (RAAF) aircraft conducted patrol activities in the South China

claiming that Australia was carrying out “freedom of navigation” flights in the South China Sea.

32 Australia has extended proactive assistance for the political and social stability of Timor-Leste since 1999, when the momentum for independence heightened in Timor-Leste. The ADF led
the International Stabilization Force (ISF) since 2006, and with the stabilization of the security situation in Timor-Leste, the withdrawal of the ADF was completed in March 2013. In the
Solomon Islands, the ADF extended assistance for their stabilization since July 2003 through the Regional Assistance Mission to Solomon Islands (RAMSI). The ADF withdrew from the
country in August 2013, when the military activities of RAMSI were completed.

33 The Australian Department of Defence plans to provide 21 Guardian-class patrol boats to the Pacific Island countries and Timor-Leste by 2023.
34 According to “The Military Balance 2019.” The breakdown by service is as follows: approx. 29,000 Army personnel; approx. 13,650 Navy personnel; and approx. 14,400 Air Force personnel.

35 Following the Declaration of victory over ISIL by the Prime Minister of Iraq in December 2017, that same month, Australia announced that it would be halting air strikes. Accordingly, the
Australian Government withdrew six F/A-18 fighter jets back to Australia on January 2018. However, the E-7A early warning and control aircraft and KC-30A refueling aircraft remain

**2** **New Zealand**


In July 2018, the coalition government of the Labour Party
and the New Zealand First Party, which is led by Prime
Minister Ardern, announced a new defense policy, the
Strategic Defence Policy Statement 2018.[36] This document
refers to major changes in the strategic environment since
the publication of the previous Defence White Paper in 2016,
including intensifying competition among powers, climate
change, and cyber and space.
The Statement then presented New Zealand’s security
objectives, specifically, ensuring public safety, preserving
sovereignty and territorial integrity, protecting lines
of communication,[37] strengthening international order,
sustaining economic prosperity, maintaining democratic
institutions and national values, and protecting the natural
environment. In order to achieve these objectives, New
Zealand prioritizes the securing of operational capabilities
in the primary operation area that stretches from the South
Pole to the Equator. The country believes that challenges to
the existing order of the Asia-Pacific region could impact its
security and prosperity and that it is important to have defense
capabilities that can globally support the maintenance of the
international rule-based order. The Statement also mentioned
other priorities, including capabilities to operate effectively
with the United States, the United Kingdom, Australia, and
Canada,[38] and the maintenance of the scale and quality of
New Zealand’s military contributions.
Moreover, the Statement was the first document that
mentioned the impact of climate change and the role of the
New Zealand Defence Force (NZDF) regarding this issue,
which reflects the new administration’s commitment to
support the Pacific Island countries that have been exposed
to increasing disasters.[39] As for the issues in the South China
Sea, New Zealand had refrained from referring to China by
name in order to maintain its neutral position in this matter.
However, in the Statement, the country made a comment
on China’s militarization in the South China Sea, stating,


“China’s more confident assertion of its interests has at times
raised tensions with neighboring states and with the United
States.”
As for diplomatic relations, New Zealand has maintained
close relationships with the United States and Australia
based on the ANZUS Treaty. In particular, New Zealand
sees Australia as its closest partner. The United States has
suspended its defense obligation to New Zealand since
1985, when New Zealand refused the entrance of a U.S.
fleet following New Zealand’s ban on nuclear weapons.
Yet, the two countries have strengthened their relationship
in the diplomacy and defense fields through the Wellington
Declaration (2010)[40] and the Washington Declaration (2012),[41]
establishing the United States as a very close strategic partner.
While New Zealand has deepened its relationship with China
through such initiatives as cooperation for the Belt and Road
Initiative and joint air exercises, it also looks at China with
a cautious eye as shown in the Strategic Defence Policy
Statement 2018.[42]

The NZDF has 9,000 personnel.[43] It has contributed
to regional peace and stability through such activities as
using patrol aircraft to conduct patrolling and monitoring of
illegal maritime activities by North Korea, including illicit
ship-to-ship transfers involving North Korea-flagged ships,
which are prohibited under the UNSCR, and dispatching
its personnel to the United Nations Command Military
Armistice Commission (UNCMAC) in the ROK, and to
other operations in the Middle East and the South Pacific.
In June 2019, the New Zealand government published
“Defence Capability Plan 2019,” which sets out planned
investments of NZ$20 billion until 2030. Investments
under the Plan are: strengthening of the relationship with
the Pacific Island countries; response to the climate crisis;
and acquisition of vessels, helicopters, transport aircraft and
others to strengthen the maritime surveillance capability.


**Chapter**


36 This statement reviews the previous Defence White Paper published in 2016 and clarifies the national defense policies and strategies proposed by the new administration.
37 According to the statement, they also include lines that allow for trading and engaging globally, in addition to communicating.
38 New Zealand also attaches importance to cooperation with these four partners in the space field.
39 In March 2018, the Arden Administration published a new package titled Pacific Reset, which aims to strengthen New Zealand’s relationships with the Pacific Island countries. In May 2018,
the administration announced additional funding of NZ$714 million over the next four years to the Official Development Assistance (ODA) budget, which represents about a 30 percent
increase in the past four years. Furthermore, in November 2018, the administration announced the establishment of a NZ$100 million fund.

40 The main content of this declaration is the strengthening of the strategic bilateral partnership in the diplomacy and defense fields.
41 The main content of this declaration is defense cooperation.
42 Spark New Zealand, New Zealand’s major telecommunication company, revealed that the New Zealand's Government Communications Security Bureau (GCSB) rejected the company’s
application to use Huawei’s technology to deploy its 5G network, citing national security risk.

**6** **Southeast Asia**


**1** **General Situation**


Southeast Asia occupies a strategic position for traffic,
linking the Pacific and the Indian Oceans, such as the Straits
of Malacca and the South China Sea. It is an important
region for Japan, which relies on maritime transport for
many of the supplies needed for economic activities and
the lives of the Japanese people. The countries in Southeast
Asia are making efforts to achieve political stability and
steady economic growth, and lately have realized overall
economic development to varying degrees. Such economic
development has deepened interdependence within the
region and with countries outside the region. In late 2015,
the establishment of the ASEAN Community was declared
as an outcome of the strides made in ASEAN cooperation
towards its integration.

**2** **Security and Defense Policies of Each Country**

1 Indonesia


Indonesia is a country of importance in Southeast Asia, with
the world’s largest Muslim population. At the same time, as it
is the largest archipelago country in the world, it has vast land
and territorial waters and strategic importance for maritime
traffic. This unique geographical position, located between
two oceans and two continents, places Indonesia centrally
amongst its ten neighboring countries’ sea and land borders.
Because of this position, Indonesia sees itself as vulnerable
to security threats, which requires the country to strategize its
position carefully.
Under the banner of the maritime nation concept,
President Joko Widodo, who first took office in October 2014
and was reelected in the presidential campaign in April 2019,
strives to revive maritime culture, address territorial disputes
through maritime diplomacy, and build maritime defense
power supported by satellite technology and drone systems.
As part of its military force reform, Indonesia aims to
meet the requirements for minimum defense capabilities—
what it calls “Minimum Essential Force (MEF).” However,
Indonesia has indicated that its maritime defense capabilities,
in particular, are still very much inadequate. Accordingly,


Meanwhile, this region still has destabilizing factors,
including the territorial disputes over the South China
Sea, ethnic minority issues, separatist and independence
movements, and Islamic extremist groups. Moreover, there
are incidents, such as piracy, by which the safe passage of
ships is obstructed. In order to cope with these issues, the
countries in Southeast Asia are working to build military
forces for national defense and maintenance of domestic
public security, as well as for addressing new security
issues such as terrorism and piracy. Recently, against the
backdrop of economic development, the countries have
been modernizing their military forces, mainly their naval
and air forces, as well as strengthening their maritime law
enforcement capacities.

Indonesia has announced a defense budget increase as
well as a policy to bolster its deployment of assets to the
Natuna Islands, in the South China Sea, and other locations.[1]
Concerned about the “nine-dash line” claimed by China,
which overlaps with Indonesia’s EEZ in the vicinity of the
Natuna Islands, Indonesia has enhanced its patrol activities
in the area. In December 2018, it was reported that Indonesia
deployed an army composite battalion, Indonesian National
Air Defense Forces Command’s radar squadron, and
Indonesian Marines composite battalion on the Natuna
Islands for an opening ceremony of a military base with piers
which can also accommodate submarines, and hangars for
unmanned vehicles.
Indonesia faces internal concerns, including the activities
of Islamic extremists, such as supporters of ISIL and Jemaah
Islamiyah (JI), and secession and independence movements
in Papua Province. In May 2018, there were a series of
terrorist attacks that have been reported as linked to Jamaah
Ansharut Daulah (JAD), a terrorist organization which
supports ISIL. With increasing public demand for stronger
counter-terrorism measures, Indonesia expanded its Police’s
investigatory powers and enhanced Indonesian National
Armed Forces’ counter-terrorism initiatives.
Indonesia emphasizes cooperation with other Southeast


**Chapter**


It is believed that in December 2015 Minister of Defense Ryamizard Ryacudu unveiled a plan to deploy a fighter squadron and small vessels to the Natuna Islands as well as increase the
number of troops stationed there from the current 800 to around 2,000, including the special operations force of the Air Force, for the purpose of “being prepared for a range of threats

Asian countries, and adopts a free and active foreign policy. In
relation to this, President Joko Widodo advocates Indo-Pacific
Cooperation Concept, which is focused on the centrality
of ASEAN. With the United States, it is strengthening its
cooperative relationship in such fields as military education
and training and military equipment procurement, and is
carrying out joint training, including “Cooperation Afloat
Readiness and Training (CARAT)”[2] and the “Southeast Asia
Cooperation Against Terrorism (SEACAT)”[3] exercises.
Indonesia has broadly positive relations with China based
on economic ties, although the territorial dispute in the
waters near the Natuna Islands has long been an issue that
could raise tension between the two countries.

See Chapter 2, Section 5-1-3 (4) (Relations with Southeast Asia

See

and the Pacific Island Countries)


Malaysia and the United States hold joint exercises such
as CARAT and SEACAT, and promote military cooperation
including capacity-building in the maritime security field.
Despite competing claims over the sovereignty of the
South China Sea and other matters, Malaysia and China have
strong ties, especially their economic relationship, and mutual
visits by dignitaries take place frequently. In November
2016, Prime Minister Najib visited China and reached an
agreement on economic cooperation and the purchase of
naval vessels. Furthermore, in November 2015, it is said that
the two countries agreed on making use of the Port of Kota
Kinabalu for port calls by Chinese Navy vessels. In January
and September 2017, a Chinese submarine made a port call.
On the other hand, the Mahathir administration formed
in May 2018 has been pushing forward reconsiderations
of large-scale infrastructure projects as a part of fiscal
reconsolidation efforts. During his visit to China in August
2018, Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad expressed his
support for the Belt and Road Initiative. However, he also
informed China that Malaysia would cancel or postpone the
long-distance railway project that started in August 2017
with China’s cooperation.[5]

As for North Korea, following the murder of Kim Jongnam at Kuala Lumpur International Airport in February 2017,
Malaysia virtually closed its embassy in North Korea, and
the relations between the two countries have deteriorated.
However, Prime Minister Mahathir expressed a flexible
position by saying that Malaysia would reopen its embassy
in Pyongyang.

3 Myanmar


Myanmar shares borders with China and India and is a gate to
the Indian Ocean. In light of these factors, Myanmar is noted
for its strategic significance. In Myanmar, the armed forces
had control over the government following the collapse of
the socialist regime in 1988. However, with an economic
slowdown caused by the economic sanctions imposed
by the West, coupled with isolation from the international
community, transition to civilian rule based on the road map
to democracy was completed.[6]

Including the release of political prisoners and ceasefire

2 Malaysia


Malaysia, which is located at the center of Southeast Asia,
perceives that its foreign policy is largely influenced by
its strategic location in Southeast Asia, its attributes as a
trading nation, and its unique demography. Moreover, while
Malaysia is currently experiencing political stability and
economic growth, it sees that current issues, particularly
non-conventional security issues, are beginning to shape
and influence the nature of threats to national defense and
security. Malaysia places importance on “Independence,”
“Total Defence,” “Commitment to the Rule of the Five
Power Defence Arrangements (FPDA),”[4] “Cooperation with
the UN for World Peace,” “Measures against Terrorism,”
and “Defence Diplomacy” in its defense policy. On the other

hand, in connection with the recent continued anchoring of
Chinese government vessels around South Luconia Shoal,
over which Malaysia claims sovereignty, Malaysia has
announced that its Navy and maritime law enforcement
agencies would conduct around-the-clock monitoring, and
that Malaysia would defend its sovereignty. Along with this
strengthening of its maritime defense force, Malaysia also
has striven to bolster its defense posture in eastern Malaysia,
constructing a new naval base in April 2017 in Bintulu, close
to James Shoal and South Luconia Shoal.

the threat of an attack on Malaysia or Singapore. The five countries carry out various exercises based on these arrangements.

In April 2019, Malaysia and China agreed to resume the construction of a long-distance railway project, reducing the cost of the construction. Malaysian and Chinese companies also
signed a supplementary agreement.

agreements with ethnic minorities,[7] the Government of
Myanmar has actively taken steps toward democratization.[8]
The international community has shown some level of
appreciation for these steps, with the West, including the
United States, successively easing economic sanctions on
Myanmar.
Meanwhile, regarding the situation in Rakhine State,[9]
Myanmar and Bangladesh agreed in October 2018 to
commence the return of the refugees to Myanmar in
November of the same year. However, their return has not
been realized yet.
In terms of foreign policy, Myanmar continues to uphold
a policy of neutrality and non-alignment, while for its
national defense policy, continues to emphasize the three
national causes of Non-disintegration of the Union, Nondisintegration of National Solidarity, and Perpetuation of
Sovereignty, as well as resolutely repelling foreign invasions
and interference in domestic matters.
China is thought to be an important partner to Myanmar
since its period of military rule. China is regarded as a major
supplier of equipment.
Myanmar has maintained a cooperative relationship with
Russia in the military field, including during the military
regime, and Russia has been a destination for students from
Myanmar and a supplier of major defense equipment. As
for India, since the transition to civilian rule, Myanmar has
deepened cooperative relations in the fields of the economy
and military, which has developed into defense cooperation
and exchanges such as the hosting of various seminars and
friendly visits to Myanmar by Indian naval vessels.
Cooperative relations with North Korea, including
weapons trades, were maintained under Myanmar’s military
regime. Following the transition to democracy, although
Myanmar denies that it has military ties to North Korea, the
report issued by the Panel of Experts of the United Nations
Security Council Sanctions Committee on North Korea in


March 2018 reported that the country has received a ballistic
missile system and other conventional weapons from North
Korea.

4 The Philippines


The Philippines considers that its archipelagic attributes
and geographic location are a source of both strength and
vulnerability. Moreover, the country sees that its strategic
location and rich natural resources have also provided a strong
temptation to expansionist powers. Based on this perception,
although resolving internal armed conflicts remains its top
security concern, rising tensions in the South China Sea
have prompted the Philippines to give the same attention
to territorial defense as it does to internal security threats.
As regional security uncertainties evolve, the Philippines,
strategically straddled between the bitterly contested South
China Sea and the Pacific Ocean, where competing interests
of superpowers and other countries converge, is aware that
it needs to chart its role in an increasingly multipolar global
order.[10]

As regards domestic security issues, over the last
approximately 40 years, armed conflicts have repeatedly
broken out between the Government of the Philippines and
the Moro Islamic Liberation Front (MILF). Following the
progress of the peace process,[11] the Organic Law for the
Bangsamoro Autonomous Region in Muslim Mindanao was
enacted in July 2018, making an important step towards
the establishment of a new autonomous government in
Mindanao. In January and February 2019, referendums on
participation in the autonomous government were held. As a

result, the participation of all but a few regions was decided.[12]
It has been reported that there are some forces opposing
the autonomous government led by the MILF, which may
cause disturbance in the future peace process. There were
bombings[13] in Jolo, Sulu, soon after the announcement of the


**Chapter**


7 About 30% of Myanmar’s population is made up of ethnic minorities, some of whom demand secession or greater autonomy for their regions. In the 1960s, the Government of Myanmar
implemented oppressive policies involving human rights violations such as forced labor and forced migration, which led to armed conflicts with armed groups of ethnic minorities.

8 The Myanmar government has been in peace talks with insurgent groups since 2011 for a ceasefire agreement. The Nationwide Ceasefire Agreement was signed with eight groups in
October 2015 and two more groups in February 2018. In December 2018, the Commander-in-Chief of the Tatmadaw (Myanmar Armed Forces) declared the cessation until the end of April
2019 of all military campaigns against the insurgent groups in northeastern Myanmar that have not yet signed the ceasefire agreement, in order to have talks with them towards ceasefire.

9 Following an attack on the police by Arakan Rohingya Salvation Army (ARSA), the Tatmadaw and other forces launched a clearance operation in August 2017. This resulted in more than
600,000 citizens (mainly Muslims) fleeing to the neighboring country, Bangladesh, in two months. The international community denounced Myanmar for the purported massacre and
human rights violation by the Tatmadaw. The Myanmar government denies the citizenship of Muslims residing in northern Rakhine State. The lack of citizenship of the refugees is making
the matter even more complicated.

10 According to National Security Strategy 2018
11 In October 2012, the Framework Agreement for the realization of a final agreement on the Mindanao peace process was signed. In January 2014, the Government of the Philippines and
MILF signed the Annex on Normalization. The goal of the Comprehensive Agreement on the Bangsamoro signed in March 2014 was to launch an autonomous government in 2016 after
formulating the Organic Law for the Bangsamoro Autonomous Region in Muslim Mindanao, holding a referendum in order to demarcate a jurisdictional domain, abolishing the Autonomous
Region in Muslim Mindanao (ARMM), and establishing the Bangsamoro Transition Authority (BTA).

12 The voting was held on January 21 and February 6. Based on the results of the referendum, five states, one city, and 63 villages decided to participate in the autonomous government. In
Sulu, the state where Abu Sayyaf Group, who took an oath of loyalty to ISIL and is against the peace process, is based, the majority voted in opposition to participation in the autonomous
government. However, since the majority of voters in the ARMM (which also includes Sulu) voted in favor of participation, it was decided that Sulu would also participate in the autonomous
government.

13 On January 27, 2019, a bombing occurred at a cathedral in Jolo, Sulu, leaving more than 20 people dead and more than 100 people injured. Although ISIL claimed responsibility for this

results of the referendums, which killed more than 20 people,
although their connection with the referendums has not been
confirmed. In May 2017, security forces clashed with the
Maute group, an Islamic extremist organization that pledges
allegiance to ISIL and had occupied the city of Marawi by
taking hostages. The enduring battle resulted in fatalities
and injuries, causing public safety in the city to deteriorate.
As a result, martial law was declared in Mindanao. The
military operations resulted in the killing of core members
and fighters of the Maute group, leading President Duterte
to declare the liberation of Marawi City from terrorists in
October of that same year. On the other hand, the declaration
of martial law was extended until the end of 2019, to quell
the continuing rebellion in the region. Moreover, the Abu
Sayyaf Group (ASG), an Islamic extremist group, has
orchestrated a number of kidnappings for ransom in the Sulu
Sea and Celebes Sea. Given this situation, in June 2017, the
Philippines, Malaysia, and Indonesia announced that they
had launched a trilateral maritime patrol in the region of the
Sulu sea. Air patrols were also started by each country in
October of that year.
The Philippines, with a historically close relationship with
the United States, has maintained a cooperative relationship
with the United States under their mutual defense treaty and
military assistance agreement, even after the withdrawal of
the U.S. Forces in 1992.[14] The two countries are conducting
joint exercises, including the large-scale military exercise
Balikatan. In March 2016, the two countries agreed on five
locations for carrying out defense cooperation under the
Enhanced Defense Cooperation Agreement (EDCA)[15] they
signed in April 2014 for strengthening their cooperation on

such areas as the capacity enhancement of the Armed Forces
of the Philippines and disaster relief.[16] During his visit to the
Philippines in March 2019, U.S. Secretary of State Mike
Pompeo made it clear that the South China Sea is part of
the Pacific Ocean and thus any armed attack on Philippine
forces, aircraft, or public vessels in the South China Sea
would trigger mutual defense obligations under the Mutual
Defense Treaty.
The Philippines and China have competing claims over
the sovereignty of the Spratly Islands and Scarborough

Shoal in the South China Sea. Seeking a settlement under
international law, in January 2013, the Philippines launched
arbitral tribunal proceedings pursuant to UNCLOS against
China. In July 2016, a final award was rendered, accepting
nearly all of the Philippines’ submissions. The Government
of the Philippines released a statement that it welcomed
the award by the arbitral tribunal and strongly affirms its
respect for the decision. Also, President Duterte stated in
his State of the Nation Address held in the same month that
the Philippines would strongly affirm and uphold the award
handed down for the arbitration case between the Philippines
and China. However, when President Duterte visited China in
October 2016, a joint statement was announced that included
infrastructure investment, drug enforcement cooperation,
coastal security cooperation and military cooperation but
did not make reference to the tribunal’s award in the case
involving the Philippines and China.
Also, in May 2017, President Duterte visited a PLA Navy
vessel that made its first port call at the port in Davao, where
the president grew up, and received rifles and other defense
counter-terrorism equipment from China in June for the
combat with the Islamic extremists in Malawi. In November
2018, General Secretary of the Communist Party of China
Xi Jinping visited the Philippines to meet President Duterte.
They signed a memorandum on energy resource development
and agreed on maritime cooperation in resources exploration.


14 In 1947, a military base agreement was concluded that allows the U.S. Forces to use Clark Air Base and Subic Bay Naval Station for 99 years. A military assistance agreement was also
concluded in 1947, followed by the mutual defense treaty in 1951. With the revision of the 1966 military base agreement, the time limit for the stationing of U.S. military bases in the
Philippines was set for 1991. Clark Air Base and Subic Bay Naval Station were returned in 1991 and 1992, respectively. Subsequently, the two countries concluded the Visiting Forces
Agreement in 1998, establishing the legal status of U.S. Forces personnel visiting for joint military exercises in the Philippines.

15 The EDCA is designed to enable the U.S. Forces to utilize and develop facilities in the Philippines, preposition equipment, among other activities. It was agreed that the bases in the
Philippines to be utilized by the U.S. Forces would be decided through consultations after the EDCA was concluded and would be stated in an annex to the agreement. After the signing in
2014, the consultations regarding the annex had been suspended as litigation procedures were instituted in the Philippines on the grounds that the EDCA was unconstitutional. However,
the Supreme Court of the Philippines handed down a ruling in January 2016 that the EDCA is indeed constitutional.

16 At the 2+2 talks held on January 12, 2016 (EST), the ministers welcomed the decision that the EDCA was constitutional, and reaffirmed their commitment to continue strengthening their
alliance in terms of ensuring both countries’ mutual defense and security as well as jointly contributing to regional peace, stability, and economic prosperity. On March 17-18, 2016 (EST), a
strategic dialogue among foreign and defense authorities was held in Washington, D.C. The two sides agreed on the following five EDCA Agreed Locations: Antonio Bautista Air Base, Basa

6 Thailand


Thailand’s defense policy includes: strengthening defense
cooperation through ASEAN, international organizations,
and other entities; defense that makes comprehensive use
of political, economic, and other national strengths; and
effective defense aimed at increasing the readiness of the
Royal Thai Armed Forces (RTAF) and developing the
defense industry. Attacks and bombing incidents by Islamic
extremists seeking secession and independence have become
a frequent occurrence in southern Thailand. The Government
identifies the swift restoration of peace and security of the
lives and property of the people in southern Thailand as an
urgent task. In addition, undemarcated border issues exist
between Thailand and neighboring countries, including
Myanmar and Cambodia.
The submission of an amnesty bill intended to pave the
way for the pardon and return of former Prime Minister
Thaksin Shinawatra by ruling parties to the National
Assembly in 2013 exacerbated domestic disorder. In May
2014, then Commander-in-Chief Prayut Chan-o-Cha of
the Royal Thai Army issued a declaration of martial law
nationwide, and then seized power via the National Council
for Peace and Order, which mostly comprises the Thai
military. Subsequently, under the interim administration
led by Prayut, who was selected as interim Prime Minister,
the government worked towards a transition to a new
administration based on the road map to civilian rule. The
new constitution was promulgated and entered into force in
April 2017. In March 2019, a general election was held for
the first time in approximately 8 years.[19]

Under its flexible omnidirectional diplomatic policy,
Thailand pursues cooperation with other Southeast Asian
countries and coordination with major countries. The U.S.Thailand joint exercise “Cobra Gold”, which has been
implemented since 1982, is currently one of the largest
multilateral exercises in the Southeast Asia.
Since the conclusion of the Military Assistance Agreement
in 1950, Thailand and its ally the United States[20] have
maintained a cooperative relationship. However, following
the coup d’état in 2014, the U.S. suspended some military
aid.
After the coup, the U.S. scaled down the size of the
U.S. forces participating in Cobra Gold. However, this
was restored under the Trump Administration. In addition,


5 Singapore


Given its limited land area, population, and resources,
Singapore’s existence and development depend on the peace
and stability of the region in a globalized economy. Singapore
gives high priority to national defense, with defense spending
accounting for about one-fifth of its national budget.
Singapore identifies deterrence and diplomacy as twin
pillars of its national defense policy. Because it is a very
small country, Singapore’s armed forces make use of the
training facilities of other countries, including the United
States and Australia, while continually dispatching military
personnel to take part in training exercises overseas.
Singapore emphasizes the importance of cooperative
relations with ASEAN and the FPDA,[17] and has concluded
defense cooperation agreements with countries within and
outside the region. With the aim of contributing to peace and
stability in the region, Singapore supports U.S. presence in
the Asia-Pacific and permits it to use military facilities in
Singapore. Since 2013, U.S. littoral combat ships (LCSs)
began their rotational deployments. In December 2015,
the P-8 patrol aircraft of the U.S. Forces were deployed to

Singapore for around one week for the first time. The two
countries have committed to continuing to carry out similar
deployments routinely.[18] In addition, Singapore conducted
joint exercises with the United States, such as CARAT and
SEACAT.
Singapore has strong economic ties with China. Both
countries also conduct joint naval exercises. On the other
hand, diplomatic relations with China have been strained
partly due to Singapore’s belief in following the arbitration
award when it comes to the resolution of the South China Sea
disputes and partly due to Singapore’s defense relationship
with Taiwan.

training CARAT and counter-piracy and trafficking exercise
SEACAT.
Thailand and China have also promoted military
exchanges, conducting joint exercises such as Blue Strike
among their marines and Falcon Strike among their air
forces. It has been pointed out that Thailand’s military
relationship with China has become closer after the freezing
of U.S. military assistance following the coup.

7 Vietnam


Vietnam perceives that it faces diverse and complex security
challenges. It considers that the issues in the South China Sea
have serious impacts on the maritime activities of Vietnam,
and non-traditional threats, such as piracy and terrorism,
are matters of concern. Based on its viewpoint that the sea
is closely associated with the national construction and
defense, Vietnam establishes an objective to become a strong
marine country, particularly prioritizing the modernization of
its military forces and law enforcement forces at sea as well
as ensuring the capacity to properly handle sea situations,
maritime independence, sovereignty, sovereign rights,
jurisdiction and national interests at sea.
During the Cold War era, the former Soviet Union
provided the most significant assistance to Vietnam. Until
2002, Russia had a naval base in Cam Ranh Bay. After
the collapse of the former Soviet Union, Vietnam rapidly
expanded its diplomatic relations with other countries,
including establishing diplomatic ties with the United States.
At present, Vietnam pursues an omnidirectional diplomatic
policy and seeks to actively participate in international and
regional cooperation in order to build friendly relations with
all countries. In March 2016, an international port opened in
the key strategic position of Cam Ranh Bay, and since then
a number of navy vessels, including some from Japan, have
made calls to the new port.
Vietnam and the United States have strengthened their
military relations in recent years. This has taken such forms
as joint exercises with the U.S. Navy and port calls by
U.S. Navy vessels in Vietnam. In 2017, mutual visits were
conducted by the leaders of both countries, and an agreement
was reached on the deepening of defense cooperation. March
2018 marked the first port call by a U.S. aircraft carrier to
Vietnam since the end of the Vietnam war.


Vietnam depends mostly on Russia for its defense
equipment, and the two countries continue to strengthen
cooperation in the area of national defense. In March 2013,
Minister of Defence Sergey Shoygu visited Vietnam, and the
two sides agreed to jointly construct vessel replenishment
facilities along Cam Ranh Bay. In 2014, Russian IL-78 aerial
refueling tankers landed at Cam Ranh International Airport
for the first time for the refueling flights for Russia’s Tu95MS strategic bombers.[21] As these examples demonstrate,
the two countries have been carrying out new military
cooperation. In recent years, the two countries have also
promoted cooperation in the energy sector, such as nuclear
power generation.

See Chapter 2, Section 4-6-2 (Relations with Asian Countries)

Vietnam and China, under their comprehensive strategic
cooperation partnership relations, proactively conduct
exchanges among their senior government officials. However,
the two countries have competing claims concerning issues
such as sovereignty over the South China Sea. In summits
and many other occasions, the two countries have agreed to
process the differences in their opinions on maritime issues
and to refrain from activities that would complicate the
matters. However, they have disputes regarding resources
development and the operation of fishing boats.
Vietnam and India have been deepening their cooperative
relationship in a broad range of areas, including security and
economy. In the area of defense cooperation, it is noted that
the Indian Armed Forces support the training of Vietnam’s
Navy submarine personnel and Air Force pilots, and Indian
Navy vessels make friendly visits to Vietnam. Furthermore,
when then Minister of National Defense Phung Quang Thanh
visited India in May 2015, the two sides signed the Joint
Vision Statement on Defence Cooperation for the period
2015-2020.[22] In September 2016, Prime Minister Modi
became the first Indian prime minister to visit Vietnam in 15
years. During the visit an agreement was reached on raising
the status of the bilateral relationship to a comprehensive
strategic partnership, while an announcement was made
concerning a loan of US$500 million for deepening defense
cooperation. Cooperation in the area of energy between India
and Vietnam is also deepening, with a joint development
program for oil and natural gas in the South China Sea.

See Chapter 3, Section 5-1 (Trends Related to the “Principle of the
Freedom of the High Seas”)


21 In March 2015, it was reported that U.S. DoD authorities, while stating the relevant facts, requested Vietnam to prevent the recurrence of this activity. In addition, a senior official of the U.S.
Pacific Command allegedly stated that the Russian military aircraft that received refueling from the aerial refueling tankers arriving from the Cam Ranh base conducted provocative flights.
In January 2015, the Russian Ministry of Defence announced that Russian aerial refueling tankers (IL-78) used Cam Ranh Bay in 2014, enabling the refueling of strategic fighters.

22 The statement was agreed upon in May 2015, when Minister of National Defense Phung Quang Thanh of Vietnam visited India and held talks with Defence Minister Manohar Parrikar. While
the content of the Joint Vision Statement has not been disclosed, it is said to cover the period 2015-2020, with maritime security cooperation constituting the main pillar. On the same day,

**3** **Military Modernization in the Region**


In recent years, Southeast Asian countries have increased
their defense spending against the backdrop of economic
development and other reasons, and are modernizing their
military forces, focusing on inducting equipment such
as submarines and fighters, including fourth-generation
modern fighters. The underlying factors noted are increases
in defense spending, the relationship between Southeast
Asian countries in the sense that they react to neighboring
states’ development of military capabilities, response to the
expansion of China’s influence, and the inadequate role of
regional security organizations to nurture relationships of
trust.[23] Many Southeast Asian countries procure much of
their defense equipment from a wide range of countries. As
such, there are perceived difficulties in achieving consistent
operations and maintenance in the respective countries.
Indonesia had introduced a total of 16 Russian Su-27
fighters and Su-30 fighters by 2013. In 2011, an agreement
was reached regarding the U.S. provision of 24 F-16 fighters,
and these have been successively delivered since July 2014.
In addition, in February 2018, Indonesia concluded an
agreement to purchase an additional 11 Su-35 fighters from
Russia. With the ROK, Indonesia concluded an agreement
in December 2011 to purchase three ROK-made 209-class
submarines, of which one was delivered in August 2017, and
another was delivered in April 2018. The two countries also
discussed joint development of the 4.5 generation KF-X/IF-X
fighter, and they concluded an agreement which sets forth
the details of their cost sharing and bilateral cooperation in
January 2016. In addition, Indonesia is domestically building
two frigates based on the Dutch Sigma-class Frigate 10514
vessel. The first of these vessels was delivered in April 2017,
and the second was delivered January 2018.
As of 2011, Malaysia had purchased 18 Su-30 fighter jets
from Russia. In addition, that same year, Malaysia introduced
two Scorpène-class submarines (jointly developed by France
and Spain) as its first submarines. In November 2014,
Malaysia reportedly concluded an agreement to purchase six
corvettes from the ROK. Malaysia announced a plan to build
six indigenous LCSs. The first of these vessels was launched
in August 2017. Furthermore, in November 2016, Malaysia
concluded an agreement with China to purchase four littoral
mission ships (LMS).
The Philippines has taken steps in recent years to


modernize its defense equipment against the backdrop of
conflicts over territorial rights in the South China Sea.
After the F-5 fighters were decommissioned in 2005,
the Philippines did not have any fighters for some length of
time. However, between November 2015 and May 2017,
the Philippines successively introduced 12 FA-50PH light
fighters purchased from the ROK.
As for naval forces, the Philippines received three
Hamilton-class frigates from the United States by 2016. The
Philippines introduced two Indonesian-made landing dock
vessels by 2017. In October 2016, the Philippines concluded
an agreement to purchase two frigates from the ROK.
Singapore is actively striving to modernize its forces.
Today, it is one of the largest arms importers in the world.
It introduced 24 U.S.-made F-15 fighters by 2012 and also
participates in the F-35 JSF Program.
As for naval forces, Singapore had introduced two
Archer-class (Västergötland-class) submarines from Sweden
by 2012. Also, in December 2013, Singapore concluded an
agreement to purchase two German 218SG-class submarines
(with plans to introduce them from 2021). By May 2017,
Singapore ordered additional two units of the same submarine
from Germany. With regard to Singapore’s current plans to
build eight indigenous patrol vessels, five such vessels came
into service as of September 2018, and the country aims to
have all vessels in operation by 2020.
As for Thailand, in July 2014, the country established the
Submarine Squadron Headquarters, and started evaluation
work to procure submarines. In April 2017, the Royal
Thai Navy drew up a plan to purchase three Yuan-class
submarines from China over the next 11 years, and the Thai
Cabinet approved the purchase of one vessel.[24] In addition,
the Cabinet approved in September 2012 a plan to introduce
two frigates. The first frigate was received from the ROK
in December 2018. In addition, by 2013, Thailand has
introduced 12 Swedish-made JAS-39 Gripen fighters.
By January 2017, Vietnam successively introduced six
Russian-made Kilo-class submarines. By February 2018,
Vietnam started the operation of four Russian-made Gepardclass frigates. As for its air force capabilities, Vietnam started
to successively introduce Russian-made Su-30 fighters
in 2004, and to date, the total number of delivered Su-30
fighters came to 36.

**4** **Intra-and Extra-Regional Cooperation**


ASEAN member states utilize ASEAN as the multilateral
security framework of the region. ASEAN holds mechanisms
such as the ARF and ASEAN Defense Ministerial Meeting
(ADMM), which provide opportunities for dialogue on
security issues. Furthermore, ASEAN has made efforts to
improve the security environment in the region and promote
mutual trust, for example, by holding the ASEAN Militaries’
Humanitarian Assistance and Disaster Relief Table-Top
Exercise (AHR). In addition, ASEAN attaches importance
to expanding its relations with countries outside of the
region. It holds the ADMM-Plus, a platform that adds eight
non-ASEAN countries including Japan to ADMM, under
which humanitarian assistance and disaster relief (HA/DR)
exercises have been conducted. With China, ASEAN held
the first naval table-top exercise in August 2018, and the first
naval field training exercise in October 2018. In relation to
this, it was reported that China requested during the meeting
for the formulation of the COC of Parties in the South China
Sea to include a clause on regular implementation of ChinaASEAN joint military exercises and a clause stating that no
military exercises shall be held jointly with countries from
outside the region, unless the parties concerned are notified
beforehand and express no objection. Meanwhile, ASEAN

1 General Situation


2 Military Affairs


With a population of more than 1.3 billion on its vast
land, India is the world’s largest democratic country. It
has achieved steady economic growth in recent years, and
has significant influence in the South Asian region. Also,
it is located in the middle of the Indian Ocean, which is of
strategic and geopolitical importance in terms of sea lines of
communication, connecting the Asia-Pacific region with the
Middle East and Europe. With the permeation of the concept
of “Indo-Pacific” in the international community, India has
increased its presence as a geopolitical player, while the
international community in return has increasingly high
expectations for the country’s role.
India has non-demarcated border issues with China and
Pakistan. India has multiple ethnic groups, religions, cultures,
and languages,[1] and there are concerns about the activities of
ultra-leftists and secession and independence movements, as
well as the movements of Islamic extremists stationed across
the India-Pakistan border.
On the diplomatic front, the Modi administration that was
inaugurated in May 2014 has maintained the neighborhood
first policy, which emphasizes strengthening relations
with South Asian countries, while expanding the focus of
strengthening India’s external relations to the Asia-Pacific
region, in accordance with the “Act East” policy.[2] In addition,
the administration has carried out proactive foreign policy,
placing priority also on India’s relations with the United
States, Russia, Europe, among other areas. In the defense
domain, maintaining preparedness at its land borders and
addressing the threat of terrorism remain major concerns. At
the same time, the administration has also recently attached
importance to ensuring maritime security, especially in
the Indian Ocean, and deepened collaboration with other
countries.


With the increasing uncertainties and challenges in the
international security environment, India considers it needs
to actively commit to defense and security cooperation with
its partners in order to fulfill the domestic public demand
for security and expectations from the region and the
international community.
As a part of the efforts to modernize its naval and air forces,
India is expanding procurement of equipment from foreign
countries as well as joint development with them, and has
emerged as the world’s largest arms importer.[3] Furthermore,
under the “Make in India” initiative, the administration is
promoting expansion of foreign companies’ direct investment
in India’s defense industry and the domestic production of
equipment through enhancing technological cooperation
with other countries.
With respect to its naval capabilities, India introduced
the Russian-built conventional powered aircraft carrier INS
Vikramaditya in November 2013, and is also building one
indigenous conventional powered aircraft carrier INS Vikrant
with aid from France and Italy. With regard to submarines,
India acquired one Russianbuilt Akula-class nuclearpowered attack submarine INS Chakra in April 2012 under
a lease arrangement. It reportedly placed into service its
first indigenous ballistic missile and nuclear submarine INS
Arihant, which was built with support from Russia, in August
2016. Furthermore, in January 2019, India announced its
collaborative project with a foreign company to domestically
build six conventional submarines. Furthermore, in 2009,
India concluded an agreement with the United States to
purchase eight P-8I patrol aircraft. India has so far deployed
all eight aircraft to a base in southern India facing the Bay of
Bengal, and in July 2016 it concluded a purchase agreement
for an additional four P-8I patrol aircraft.
With respect to its air force capabilities, India is
refurbishing its existing fighter aircraft. Moreover, it signed
an agreement to purchase 36 Rafale fighter aircraft from
France in September 2016 as part of India’s plan to introduce

been adopted since the inauguration of the Modi administration.

ten C-17 transport aircraft and had introduced all of these
aircraft by 2014.

nearly three years, but then India annulled this agreement,
denouncing the Pakistani militant group that crossed the
border and abducted and murdered three Indian police
officers. Dialogues have been suspended ever since. In
February 2019, a Pakistan-based terrorist group committed a
suicide bombing in Jammu and Kashmir, a region occupied
by India, killing 40 personnel of India’s Central Reserve
Police Force (CRPF). Following this incident, Indian aircraft
trespassed on Pakistan’s airspace and conducted air strikes.
In return, Pakistani aircraft crossed LOC and conducted air
strikes on the Indian side. Other than that, some exchanges of
fire have also taken place along LOC. The tension between
the two countries is intensifying in Kashmir.


Based on the nuclear doctrine of 2003, India adheres to
the following policies: credible minimum deterrence, the nofirst-use nuclear policy, no use against non-nuclear weapon
nations, and maintaining the unilateral moratorium on nuclear
tests that it announced immediately after the nuclear test in
1998. India promotes the development and deployment of
various ballistic missiles. India conducted the seventh test
launch of “Agni 5” in December 2018 and reportedly started
developing “Agni 6,” which is alleged to have a range of up
to 10,000 km. It is deemed that the country aspires to extend
the ranges of ballistic missiles and make other performance
improvements. In regard to cruise missiles, India jointly
develops “BrahMos” with Russia and deploys them. India is
also developing a ballistic missile defense system.[5]

3 Relations with Other Countries


**(1) Relations with Pakistan**

India and Pakistan have disputes over the sovereignty of
Kashmir,[6] and have had three armed conflicts of significant
scope. The territorial dispute over Kashmir has long been
in contention between India and Pakistan, with dialogues
repeatedly resuming and suspending due to frequent crossborder attacks along the Line of Control (LOC).
In December 2015, the foreign affairs ministers of the
two countries agreed to resume the dialogue. However, this
effort was failed by subsequent cross-border attacks. Prime
Minister of Pakistan Imran Khan, who took office in August
2018, sent a letter to Prime Minister of India Narendra Modi
to call for the recommencement of dialogues. They once
agreed to hold the first foreign affairs ministers’ meeting in


**Chapter**


**(2) Relations with the United States**

India is actively striving to strengthen bilateral relations
with the United States. In line with the expansion of the
relationship derived from the economic growth of India,
the United States is also promoting engagement with India.
It sees India as a partner that shares universal values and
strategic interests with the United States in the region. The
two countries conduct joint exercises, such as Malabar[7] with
Japan taking part, on a regular basis. In addition, in recent
years, the United States has become one of India’s major


Since 2007, India has been implementing a project to introduce 126 MMRCA. In 2012, India announced that it selected the French Rafale aircraft. In April 2015, during his visit to France,
Prime Minister Modi expressed India’s intention to swiftly purchase 36 Rafale aircraft. It is believed that a purchase agreement was signed in September 2016 and discussions are still
ongoing regarding the model of the remaining 90 aircraft.

Reports specify these missiles as follows. Agni 5: a mobile, three-stage solid-fuelled ballistic missile with a range of about 5,000-8,000 km. Agni 6: a three-stage solid/liquid-fuelled
ballistic missile with a range of about 8,000-10,000 km. BrahMos: a solid/Ramjet supersonic cruise missile with a range of about 300-500 km. Also, India is reportedly developing a
ballistic missile defense system. According to reports, it is a two-stage intercept system consisting of a missile for high altitude interception (PAD) up to 80 km in altitude and a missile for
low altitude interception (AAD) up to 30 km in altitude.

India asserts the accession of Kashmir to India, based on the Instrument of Accession document by which the ruler of Kashmir acceded to India at the time of Pakistan’s independence, and
contends that this matter should be resolved through bilateral negotiations on the basis of the 1972 Simla Agreement (an agreement on the peaceful resolution of disputes and the
withdrawal of their military forces that was reached following a summit meeting held in Simla in northern India). On the other hand, Pakistan declares that this should be decided through a
referendum, in line with a 1948 UN resolution. The two countries have taken a significantly different fundamental stance towards the resolution of the dispute.

The Malabar was initially a bilateral naval exercise between the United States and India. Japan has participated in the Malabar since 2007, and Malabar 17 and Malabar 18 were conducted

equipment procurement destinations.[8]

At the Summit Meeting in January 2015, two leaders agreed
that they would expand technology cooperation to include codevelopment and co-production of equipment. The leaders
also affirmed that they would deepen cooperation in the field
of maritime security, and agreed that cooperation between
their navies would be expanded, including upgrading their
bilateral naval exercise Malabar. Furthermore, at the Defense
Ministerial Meeting in December 2015, the two sides held
talks on strengthening various defense cooperation, and
confirmed the progress made in the technology cooperation
consultations related to aircraft carriers and jet engines
conducted by their joint working group. In such ways, their
cooperation in the field of security has expanded. In addition,
when Prime Minister Modi visited the United States in June
2016, the United States recognized that India is a “Major
Defense Partner.” In August 2016, in a joint statement of the
U.S. and Indian defense ministers, the United States agreed
to elevate defense trade and technology sharing with India
to a level commensurate with its closest allies and partners.
Also, a memorandum was signed concerning logistics

**2** **Pakistan**

1 General Situation


Wedged between the powerful South Asian nation of India
and politically-unstable Afghanistan, and sharing borders
with China and Iran, Pakistan is placed in a geopolitically
significant and complex position. In particular, Islamic
extremists conduct activities across the Pakistan-Afghanistan
border, and Pakistan’s attitude towards the war against
terrorism draws much attention from the international
community.
While supporting the United States’ war against terrorism in
Afghanistan, the Government of Pakistan has been struggling
as its domestic security situation has worsened, with issues
such as growing anti-U.S. sentiment and retaliatory terrorism
by Islamic extremists. Although the Pakistan Armed Forces’
reinforced operation to crackdown on militant groups has
reportedly drastically decreased terrorism, terrorist attacks
have continued to occur sporadically.
Against such backdrop, the Pakistani government has
continued its counter-terrorism operation, “Radd-ul-Fasaad,”


support cooperation.
In June 2017, Prime Minister Modi visited the United
States. At his first summit meeting with President Trump,
the two sides agreed to continue to strengthen their strategic
partnership. In the area of security, they underscored the
importance of Malabar, and furthermore, the United States
proposed the sale of unmanned aerial systems, attack
helicopters, and C-17 transport aircraft. In September 2018,
the first U.S.-India “2+2” Meeting was held. In this meeting,
the two countries signed the Communications Compatibility
and Security Agreement (COMCASA), which aims to
promote access to advanced defense systems and ensure the
optimal use of a U.S.-made platform owned by India, while
also agreeing to conduct tri-service bilateral exercises.

since 2017, while also working on the construction of fences
and guarding stations along the border with Afghanistan to
prevent the entrance of extremist groups. In December 2018,
Prime Minister Khan announced that Pakistan had helped
in the U.S.-Taliban dialogue, and that the country would do
everything within its power to further the peace process in
Afghanistan.

2 Military Affairs


Pakistan takes the position that maintaining nuclear deterrence
against the nuclear threat posed by India is essential to ensure
national security and self-defense. In the past, the so-called
Khan network was involved in the proliferation of nuclearrelated materials and technologies.[9]

Pakistan has been actively proceeding with the
development of ballistic missiles and cruise missiles capable
of carrying nuclear warheads, and has conducted a number of
test launches in recent years. In 2015, Pakistan conducted two
test launches of the ballistic missile “Shaheen 3” in March
and December, and a test launch from an aircraft of the cruise


According to the statistics from 2013 to 2017 in SIPRI YEARBOOK 2018

Pakistan is believed to have started its nuclear program in the 1970s and conducted its first nuclear test near the Changai District of the Balochistan Province in 1998. In 2004, it came to
light that nuclear-related technologies, including uranium enrichment technology, had been transferred to North Korea, Iran, and Libya by Dr. Khan and other scientists, who had led the

missile Raad in January 2016. Pakistan also conducted
its first test launch of the ballistic missile “Ababeel,” which
is capable of delivering multiple warheads, using MIRV
technology, in January 2017. Like it did in the previous year,
it conducted another test fire of submarine launched cruise
missile “Babur” in March 2018. It is deemed that Pakistan is
steadily increasing the military capabilities of its missiles.[10]

Pakistan is the world’s ninth largest importer of weapons,
and it is pointed out that 70% of its weapons are imported
from China.[11] Pakistan purchased four Sword-class frigates
from China, while at the same time it has engaged in the joint
development of the JF-17 fighter aircraft with China and
has introduced 85 aircraft through indigenous production.
It is reported that Pakistan has also agreed to purchase
four additional frigates from China, while also planning to
purchase eight submarines, of which four will be built in
China and the other four will be built in Pakistan. Although
Pakistan introduced 18 F-16C/D fighter jets received from
the United States by 2011, due to the recent degradation of
the Pakistan-U.S. relationship, it has been pointed out[12] that
weapon imports into Pakistan seem to be on the decline.

3 Relations with Other Countries


**(1) Relations with India**


The two countries conducted strategic dialogues from
2010, and the United States provided Pakistan with military
support. However, these were suspended after U.S.-Pakistan
relations deteriorated as a consequence of the then Osama
Bin Laden mop-up operation conducted by the U.S. Forces
in the territory of Pakistan in May 2011. In October 2013,
dialogue was resumed after summit meetings were held
between then President Obama and then Prime Minister
Sharif of Pakistan, and in January 2014, Pakistan and the
United States held their first strategic dialogue in three years.
Meanwhile, Pakistan urges the United States to
immediately end its drone attacks on Islamic extremists
in Pakistani territory, and the Pakistan Government has
protested repeatedly.
The United States, on the other hand, has condemned
Pakistan for allowing Islamic extremists in Afghanistan
to take haven, which poses a threat to the United States.
In August 2017, “No partnership can survive a country’s
harboring of militants and terrorists who target U.S. Service
members,” President Trump said. The same month, the
United States announced the suspension of $205 million in
Foreign Military Assistance to Pakistan, which was provided
by the Department of State (DOS). Following this, it also
announced the suspension of DOS’ security assistance to
Pakistan in January 2018 and the suspension of $300 million
of the Coalition Support Funds in September 2018. These
measures will not be lifted until the Pakistani Government
takes decisive action against terrorist groups, including the
Afghan Taliban. Attention will be paid to further action by
the two countries moving forward.

**(3) Relations with China**


**Chapter**


See Chapter 2, Section 7-1-3 (1) (Relations with Pakistan)

**(2) Relations with the United States**

Besides supporting the activities of the U.S. Forces in
Afghanistan, Pakistan cooperates with the war on terror
by launching mop-up operations against Islamic extremists
in the Pakistan-Afghanistan border area. Recognizing the
efforts of Pakistan, the United States designated it as a
“major non-NATO ally” in 2004.

With the end of the Cold War, many European countries now
recognize the need to address diverse security challenges,
such as outbreaks of regional conflicts within and around
Europe, the rise of terrorism, the proliferation of WMDs,
and an increasing number of cyber threats. At the same time,
these countries had recognized that the threat of large-scale
invasion by other countries had disappeared. Nevertheless,
since the heightening of tensions in Ukraine in February
2014, there is a growing need to revisit existing strategies
and plan new concepts in order to deal with Russia’s changes
to the status quo with force in the background and “hybrid
warfare.” With regard to international terrorism, the incidents
of terrorism occurring within European nations have made
counterterrorism efforts an urgent task.[1] In addition, border
security problems remain a challenge, including those
regarding refugees and migrants that have rapidly increased
due to Middle East turmoil such as the prolonged civil war
in Syria.
To respond to such challenges and situations, Europe
has sought to further strengthen and expand[2] multilateral
frameworks, such as NATO and the EU. At the same time,

1 NATO


Founded for the core task of collective defense among
member states, NATO has expanded the scope of its activities
to conflict prevention and crisis management since the end of


it is working to contribute to the security and stability of
the international community by proactively participating
in activities outside the European region. Moreover, steps
are taken at the national level by reviewing security and
defense strategies, reforming national defense systems, and
strengthening bilateral[3] and multilateral[4] defense and security
cooperation.
Further, in light of changes in the security environment, the
downward trend of defense expenditure, and the expanding
gap of defense expenditure between the United States and
other member states, NATO member states in 2014 agreed
on the goal to allocate 2% or more of their GDP to national
defense spending by 2024.[5] Regarding the matter, U.S.
President Trump at the NATO Summit in July 2018 strongly
demanded defense spending expansion by member states
failing to attain the goal, emphasizing a feeling of unfairness
about larger defense spending as a percentage of GDP in the
United States than in other NATO member states.[6]

the Cold War.
In the NATO Summit in November 2010, NATO adopted
a new Strategic Concept[7] for the first time in 11 years to
propose a guideline for the next decade for the creation of a
more efficient and flexible alliance. The document cites major
threats such as proliferation of WMDs and ballistic missiles,


Recently, a man attacked passersby with a knife at a station in the United Kingdom (December 2018), a man raided passersby with a gun and a knife near a Christmas market in France
(December 2018), and a man assaulted shoppers with a knife at a supermarket in Germany (July 2017). European countries are now reviewing their security systems and tightening
immigration controls, among other measures. See Part I, Chapter 3, Section 7

NATO has continued expanding towards Central and Eastern Europe with the aim of stabilizing the entire European and Atlantic regions. In February 2019, North Macedonia was approved
as a new NATO member, leading NATO members to take ratification procedures for the first new NATO member since Montenegro’s accession to the alliance in 2017.

For example, the United Kingdom and France signed the Treaty between the United Kingdom and the French Republic for Defence and Security Co-operation and the Treaty between the
United Kingdom and the French Republic relating to Joint Radiographic/Hydrodynamics Facilities at a bilateral summit meeting held in November 2010. At a summit in January 2019, the
two countries signed the Aachen Treaty on cooperation in enhancing European integration. The treaty aims to further enhance military cooperation, implement joint exercises and
deployment, and create a joint force to stabilize third countries.

In June 2018, for example, nine European countries—France, Germany, the United Kingdom, Estonia, the Netherlands, Spain, Denmark, Belgium, and Portugal—launched the European
Intervention Initiative with a common firm intention to promote the revitalization of Europe in the strategic field. At a ministerial meeting of the 10 countries, including Finland, which had
joined the initiative in November 2018, they approved a political guideline as the base for their future operational work. The initiative pursues visible achievements including building
capacity to jointly address natural disasters and enhancing capabilities to conduct high-intensity military operations. However, details are still under consideration.

In 2018, only seven member states (the United States, Greece, the United Kingdom, Estonia, Poland, Latvia, and Lithuania) achieved the standard. On the other hand, the declaration
adopted at the NATO Summit in July 2018 indicated that some two-thirds of the NATO members had national plans in place to spend 2% or more of their GDP on defense by 2024.

In this respect, reports said U.S. President Trump doubted the necessity of the military alliance and discussed the United States’ possible withdrawal from NATO with senior government
officials before and after the July 2018 NATO Summit. At a press conference after the summit, the President indicated his idea that NATO members’ defense spending should finally reach
4% of their respective GDP.

The Strategic Concept is an official document defining the objectives, characteristics, and basic national security responsibilities of NATO. The document has so far been formulated seven

collective defense in accordance with Article 5 of the NATO
Treaty; (2) crisis management including confl ict prevention
and post-confl ict stabilization and reconstruction assistance;
and (3) cooperative security including active contribution to
arms control, disarmament, and non-proliferation.
Following Russia’s “hybrid warfare” as well as the
frequent “unusual fi ghts” of Russian Armed Force aircraft

over the European front, including three Baltic states, NATO
and member states reaffi rmed the threat posed by Russia.
In April 2014, they suspended practical cooperation with
Russia and took other steps, including expanding its Baltic
air policing mission, which had taken place from 2004 when
the three Baltic nations joined NATO.[8] Additionally, at the
NATO Summit in September 2014, leaders adopted a joint
declaration demanding Russia to retract its “annexation” of
Crimea and adopted the Readiness Action Plan (RAP) for
enhancing existing readiness forces.[9] This plan was created
in order to deal with the infl uence of Russia and threats from
the Middle East and North Africa. Based on this plan, NATO
has continued to maintain its presence in eastern allies, while
steps have been taken to signifi cantly improve the readiness

of the existing multinational NATO Response Force (NRF)
and create the Very High Readiness Joint Task Force (VJTF)
that can be mobilized within two to three days.[10] Furthermore,
the declaration adopted at the NATO Summit in July 2016
cited Russia’s aggressive actions and terrorism by ISIL as
threats. At the meeting, a decision was reached to deploy
four battalions to the three Baltic nations and Poland on a
rotational basis, which became fully operational in 2017.
The declaration adopted at the NATO Summit in July 2018

cited the following: (1) the establishment of the Joint Force
Command Norfolk in the United States, the headquarters
aimed at strengthening the defense of Atlantic Ocean
sea lanes that link the United States and Europe, (2) the
establishment of the Joint Support and Enabling Command
in Ulm, Germany, the headquarters aimed at expediting
transport of troops and equipment within and outside
Europe, and (3) the arrangement of the Readiness Initiative
called the “Four Thirties” by 2020 to maintain a situation in
which 30 mechanized battalions, 30 air squadrons, and 30
combat vessels can be ready to be used within 30 days or
less. From October to November 2018, NATO implemented
the “Trident Juncture 2018,” one of the largest NATO drills
in recent years, to train the readiness and joint operations


8 NATO has conducted air policing on a rotational basis since 2004. The missions involved patrolling by one country with four aircraft, but since the crisis in Ukraine, the missions were
enhanced, shifting to patrolling by four countries with 16 aircraft. In September 2015, the missions were reduced. Currently, NATO air policing is being conducted over Slovenia, Iceland,
Albania, and Montenegro in addition to the three Baltic nations.

9 The RAP was approved as one of the concrete efforts of the Connected Forces Initiative (CFI). The CFI is intended to provide a framework for conducting joint exercises and drills among
member states. Furthermore, it is designed to strengthen joint drills among member states and with partner countries, enhance interoperability, and make use of advanced technology.

prevention over intervention, NATO has affirmed that it
would activate its collective defense if any member state
were attacked by ISIL. Furthermore, the Warsaw Summit
Communiqué of July 2016 set forth the decision to dispatch
early warning and control aircraft forces to fight against ISIL.
Under the decision, NATO surveillance and reconnaissance
missions started October 2016. NATO announced the
commencement of the new NATO Mission Iraq (NMI) at the
NATO Summit in July 2018, providing training and capacitybuilding support for Iraqi security forces.
NATO is also carrying out missions in Kosovo and other
countries.[13]

2 EU


The EU seeks to enhance its security initiatives under the
Common Foreign and Security Policy (CFSP) and Common
Security and Defence Policy (CSDP),[14] and in June 2016,
Global Strategy for the European Union’s Foreign and
Security Policy detailing the EU’s fundamental approach
to foreign and security policy was adopted by the European
Council for the first time in approximately 10 years. This
document calls for initiatives towards enhancing the EU’s
internal and external resilience against threats to order in
Eastern Europe, and the threat of terrorism or other events in
the Middle East and Africa, in accordance with the principles
of rules-based order and democracy.[15] In November 2016, the
European Commission released an action plan for reinforcing
defense cooperation in Europe, including the establishment
of the European Defence Fund.
In December 2017, the Permanent Structured Cooperation

(PESCO) was launched as a defense cooperation framework
for 25 countries among the member countries. Under this
framework, the participating countries finance and cooperate
in joint projects including the joint development of equipment
and infrastructure that will contribute to developing
readiness. It is expected that the framework would strengthen
the EU’s defense capabilities. In this way, the EU is trying to
enhance capabilities for undertaking security and its strategic
independence.

against every potential threat, enhancing its defense efforts.
Views on Russia differ between NATO member states against
the backdrop of their different geographical distances from
Russia. While taking measures to address Russian influence,
NATO members have maintained opportunities for dialogue
to narrow their differences in views about Russia and increase
their predictability.[11]

In the Mediterranean, a permanent maritime force
has been deployed to the Aegean Sea since February
2016 due to the influx of illegal immigrants transiting the
Mediterranean. This force monitors the influx of illegal
immigrants and shares information with Turkey, Greece,
and other countries. Also, in November 2016, Operation
Active Endeavor, focused on collective defense held since
2001, was succeeded by Operation Sea Guardian, focused
on crisis management, resulting in a wider array of missions
including counterterrorism and capacity-building assistance,
among others.
Since January 2015, NATO has been leading the Resolute
Support Mission (RSM), whose primary tasks are to provide
training, advice, and assistance to the Afghan National
Defense and Security Forces (ANDSF). At the NATO
Summit in July 2018, NATO decided to maintain its presence
in Afghanistan until seeing signs of changes in the local
situation and enhance support for Afghanistan by extending
financial assistance for ANDSF until 2024. It has stationed
17,000 personnel in Afghanistan.[12]

With regard to ISIL, while taking the stance of emphasizing


**Chapter**


11 For example, France held talks with President Putin of Russia following the terror attacks in November 2015, and the two sides agreed to exchange intelligence between their military
forces. The United Kingdom, in its strategy document SDSR2015, states that the issues of Ukraine would significantly change the rules-based international order, while it also states that
the country would seek ways to cooperate with Russia on the issues of ISIL topping the list. Germany, too, has stated the need for deterrence and dialogue with Russia in its white paper on
national defense published in July 2016. Additionally, in April 2016, NATO held a meeting of the NATO-Russia Council, a dialogue framework, in Brussels for the first time in almost two
years. So far, nine meetings of the council have been held.

12 As of February 2019, U.S. participants numbered 8,475, accounting for approximately 50% of the total.
13 In Kosovo, NATO has carried out its mission within the framework of the Kosovo International Security Force since 1999. Today, NATO provides recommendations, training, and capacitybuilding assistance to the Kosovo Security Force.

14 The EU, although it has a property of non-binding multilateral cooperation, introduced the CFSP, which covers all areas of foreign and security policy based on the Treaty of Maastricht,
which took effect in 1993. In June 1999, the European Council decided to implement the European Security and Defence Policy (ESDP) to offer peacekeeping and humanitarian assistance
activities in conflict areas, as a part of the CFSP framework. The Treaty of Lisbon, made effective in 2009, renamed the ESDP to CSDP and clearly positioned it as an integral part of the
CFSP.

15 In November 2016, an agreement was reached on the execution of this strategy, with priority given to responding to conflict and crises outside of the EU, capacity building of partners, and

the area and conduct surveillance in these waters. In addition,
those vessels and aircraft conduct joint exercises with SDF
units.[20]

3 Cooperation between NATO and the EU


Advancements have been seen in cooperation between NATO
and the EU in addressing unprecedented challenges efficiently.
At the NATO Summit in July 2016, a joint declaration was
released citing hybrid threats, cybersecurity and other fields
in which NATO and the EU should prioritize cooperation.
The NATO Summit in July 2018 issued a joint declaration
that identified substantial progress in NATO-EU cooperation
and cited the mobility of military forces, counterterrorism
and other fields for further cooperation. Based on these
declarations, NATO’s Operation Sea Guardian and the
EU’s Operation Sophia are now mutually collaborating
through information support in the Mediterranean. The EU’s
PESCO includes a project for developing arrangements for
smooth movement of military personnel and assets inside
and outside the EU and is expected to contribute to NATO’s
quick military deployment in emergency. In this way, NATO
and the EU are advancing their cooperation in a manner to
complement each other for the purpose of enhancing security
initiatives.


In response to the crisis in Ukraine, the EU has condemned
the military measures of Russia and implemented economic
sanctions against Russia.[16] In addition, to support the
economic and political reforms in Ukraine, the EU continues
its engagement in nonmilitary affairs, including the provision
of large-scale financial assistance to Ukraine.
To deal with the threat of ISIL, the EU extends funds
to carry out humanitarian assistance for Syria and Iraq.
Additionally, the EU works with countries in regions such
as the Middle East and North Africa to provide capacitybuilding assistance in counterterrorism measures, among
other activities. In November 2015, in accordance with a
request from France after the terror attacks in Paris, the EU,
for the first time, activated the “mutual assistance clause”[17]
stipulating a mutual defense obligation, and EU member
states provided their support to France.[18]

In May 2015, the EU started Operation Sophia
conducted by European Union Naval Force Mediterranean
(EUNAVFORMed) due to the surge of refugees and migrants
crossing the Mediterranean Sea into Europe. The operation’s
main mission is to block smuggling and human trafficking,
with its adjunctive mission being to train the Libyan Navy
Coast Guard and enforce the UN arms embargo on the high
seas. At its meeting in July 2017, the EU Foreign Affairs
Council agreed to expand the operation by adding new
missions including reconnaissance on illegal transactions in
crude oil exported from Libya and information sharing with
relevant organizations on human trafficking.
In 2003, the EU led peacekeeping operations for the first
time in Macedonia (then) by using NATO’s equipment and
capabilities. Since then, it has been actively committed to
the operations in crisis management and maintenance of
peace and order[19] by, for example, sending troops to BosniaHerzegovina, Sudan, the Democratic Republic of the Congo,
Chad, Mali, Central Africa, and Somalia. Also, the EU has
been conducting Operation Atalanta, the first maritime
mission to combat piracy off the Somalia and in the Gulf
of Aden since December 2008. Under this mission, vessels
and aircraft dispatched from each country protect ships in


**Chapter**


Signing of a joint declaration on cooperation between NATO and EU by President Tusk of
the European Council, Secretary General Stoltenberg of NATO, and President Juncker of
the European Commission [courtesy of NATO]


16 The EU takes measures, such as capital regulations and ban on exports of equipment and dual use goods, along with asset freezes and travel bans, and extends its expiry date every six
months.

17 Article 42, Paragraph 7 of the Treaty on European Union provides for a mutual defense obligation, where if an EU member state is the victim of armed aggression on its territory, the other
member states shall have towards it an obligation of aid and assistance by all the means in their power in accordance with Article 51 of the UN Charter.

18 On November 17, 2015 after the terror attacks, then Minister for Defence Jean-Yves Le Drian of France requested the application of the “mutual assistance clause” at the EU Foreign
Affairs Council meeting. The application was agreed upon unanimously. Based on the application of the clause, France requested other EU member states to: (1) contribute to counter-ISIL
operations in Iraq and Syria; and (2) help reduce the military burden of France by contributing to France’s counter-terrorism operations in Mali, Central Africa, and other areas. Nevertheless,
the extent of cooperation has remained relatively small, except for that from the United Kingdom and Germany.

19 These are called Petersberg tasks. They consist of: (1) humanitarian assistance and rescue mission; (2) peacekeeping mission; and (3) combat mission in crisis management, including
peacemaking. In January 2014, for example, the EU decided to dispatch a security force to the Central African Republic, which was plagued with turmoil. The security force launched its
operations in April 2014 and ended them in March 2015, when the European Union’s Military Advisory Mission (EUMAM) was launched to support preparations for reforming the security
sector of the Central African Republic. In July 2016, the EUMAM was succeeded by the European Union’s Training Mission (EUTM). In July 2018, the EU decided to extend ETUM operations
until September 2020, continuing training for the modernization of the Central African Republic forces.

20 To tackle piracy in this area, the EU has undertaken “European Union Training Mission-Somalia” and “European Union Maritime Security Capacity Building Mission in Somalia,” in addition
to Operation Atalanta. Based on a comprehensive approach, the EU not only implements piracy countermeasures, but is also working to develop and strengthen its coastal policing and

airstrikes against ISIL in Iraq. In addition, it carries out ISR
activities using unmanned aerial vehicles, provides education
and training to forces engaged in ground warfare such as the
Iraqi Security Forces and Peshmerga, a military organization
of the Kurdistan Regional Government, as well as extends
humanitarian assistance to refugees. Furthermore, following
the terror attacks in Paris, the United Kingdom decided in
December 2015 to extend the scope of the airstrikes from
Iraq to Syria, and commenced airstrikes in Syria on the day
after the Parliament gave its approval.[23]

In the NSS-SDSR2015, the United Kingdom recognizes
the Asia-Pacific region as offering significant economic
opportunities for the country and as exerting considerable
influence on the future integrity and credibility of the rulesbased international order, indicating its commitment to
attaching importance to working with security partners in the
region. In particular, the United Kingdom considers Japan as
its closest security partner in Asia, conducting joint exercises
with Japan.[24] It has also participated in the multilateral joint
exercise RIMPAC and deployed naval ships in the region,
enhancing its engagement in regional security. In February
2018, the Rt Hon Gavin Williamson, Secretary of State for
Defence of the United Kingdom, noted that the British Royal
Navy Frigate HMS Sutherland would be sailing through
the South China Sea and that the Royal Navy has a right
to such sailing. In early May 2018, in order to contribute to
international efforts to monitor prohibited trading at sea by
North Korea, the HMS Sutherland conducted information
gathering activities regarding ships suspected of conducting
“ship-to-ship transfers” in the high seas surrounding Japan.[25]
Further, in April 2018, the Secretary of State for Defence
announced that the Royal Navy’s landing ship HMS Albion[26]
was dispatched to the Asia-Pacific Region. In September


1 The United Kingdom


After the end of the Cold War, the United Kingdom, perceiving
that there is no direct military threat against the country, has
advanced national defense reform with particular focus on
improving its overseas deployment capability and readiness,
in order to deal with new threats such as international
terrorism and proliferation of WMDs.
Against this backdrop, in November 2015, the Cameron
administration released the National Security Strategy and
Strategic Defence and Security Review (NSS-SDSR2015)
in the face of destabilization in the Middle East, including
the rise of ISIL, the crisis in Ukraine, and the threat posed
by cyber-attacks. Recognizing that the United Kingdom
confronts threats from both states and non-state actors, the
NSS-SDSR2015 sets out the challenges that the United
Kingdom should address in the coming decade as follows:
terrorism and extremism; resurgence of state-based threats;
technological developments including cyber threats; and
the erosion of the rules-based international order. While the
previous SDSR2010 committed to cutting the troop strength,
reducing key equipment, and reviewing procurement
plans due to pressure to decrease defense spending, the
NSS-SDSR2015 calls for ending the defense spending
cuts and explicitly proposes to increase the defense force
in order to develop capacities to address the entire list of
expanded threats.[21] The NSS-SDSR2015 lays out that the
United Kingdom would continue to be a key player in the
international community, and promote procurement of
equipment and formation of units with high readiness and
mobility, in view of dealing with threats such as terrorism
and cyber security.[22]

Since September 2014, the United Kingdom has conducted


**Chapter**


21 The “NSS-SDSR2015” will maintain the size of the Armed Forces personnel and increase the Royal Navy and Royal Air Force by 700 personnel combined. It also decided to build two
aircraft carriers, introduce nine new maritime patrol aircraft, and maintain a fleet of four strategic nuclear submarines. Underpinned by a stable economy, the NSS-SDSR2015 is to maintain
defense expenditure amounting to 2% of GDP which is the NATO’s target and to further increase defense spending, especially equipment procurement spending.

22 The NSS-SDSR2015 is to add two Typhoon squadrons, establish a F-35 squadron capable of operating from new aircraft carriers, create two strike brigades of up to 5,000 personnel, and
have a system that can deploy an expeditionary force of around 50,000 personnel overseas by 2025.

23 Since 2014, the United Kingdom has conducted over 1,600 aerial bombings, held training for over 70,000 Iraqi military soldiers, and dispatched over 1,400 United Kingdom military
personnel.

24 From October to November 2016, Typhoon fighters visited Japan to conduct a Japan-U.K. bilateral exercise. In April 2018, the Royal Navy frigate HMS Sutherland conducted a bilateral
exercise with MSDF, including Destroyer JS “Suzunami.” In August 2018, the Royal Navy landing ship HMS Albion conducted a joint exercise with the MSDF transport ship JS “Shimokita”.
In September 2018, the Royal Navy frigate HMS Argyll conducted a joint drill with Destroyer JS “Kaga” and other MSDF ships. From September to October 2018, a bilateral exercise was
conducted in Japan between the army service branches of both countries. In December 2018, the Royal Navy frigate HMS Argyll conducted a joint exercise with MSDF and the U.S. Navy. In
March 2019, the Royal Navy frigate HMS Montrose conducted a joint drill with MSDF and the U.S. Navy.

25 Furthermore, warning and surveillance operations were conducted in Japan’s periphery, including the East China Sea, by the Royal Navy landing ship HMS Albion from late May to early
June 2018 and in mid-June 2018, by the Royal Navy frigate HMS Argyll in mid-December 2018 and early January 2019, and by the Royal Navy frigate HMS Montrose from late February to
early March 2019.

From the viewpoint of enhancing the effectiveness of the UN Security Council resolutions, Japan and the United Kingdom engaged in cooperation activities, including information sharing. In
March 2019, a strongly suspected case of a ship-to-ship transfer between the Saebyol, a North Korea-flagged tanker, and a small ship of unidentified nationality, was confirmed and
announced based on the sharing of information between a MSDF supply ship and a Royal Navy frigate that were engaging in patrol and monitoring activities.

26 In August 2018, the Royal Navy landing ship HMS Albion was reported as sailing around the Parcel Islands in the South China Sea. In response, China’s Ministry of National Defense
d it t di t t ith d l t iti t th ti

2018, the Royal Navy frigate HMS Argyll made a port call in
Pakistan before being deployed in the region. The Ministry
of Defence of the United Kingdom noted that the deployment
of these three ships meant that the Royal Navy would have
an almost unbroken presence in the Asia-Pacific region
throughout 2018. In addition, the Royal Navy dispatched
the HMS Montrose frigate to the region in October 2018 for
operations to help stabilize the region and develop relations
with the region. Such Royal Navy deployment in the AsiaPacific region is viewed as unprecedented since the Korean
War. Future relevant developments will attract attention,
including the dispatch of the aircraft carrier Queen Elizabeth
to the region.[27]

In March 2017, the United Kingdom officially informed
the EU of its intention to leave the union. In November 2018,
draft exit agreements were approved at a special meeting of
the European Council. Later, however, the U.K. Parliament
voted against the agreements three times with the result that
the deadline for the exit has been pushed back until October
31, making the future course of the exit uncertain. Even after
the exit from the EU, the United Kingdom is expected to
retain the recognition of NATO as the cornerstone of security
in Europe and pursue new security relations with the EU
in which it would participate in the PESCO permanent EU
defense cooperation framework open to non-EU countries
if cooperation in research and development is concluded as
benefiting both the country and the EU. Given the notion
that the United Kingdom’s exit from the EU would reduce
the EU’s influence on security, attention will be paid to the
degree of the United Kingdom’s engagement in EU security
initiatives and its relations with the United States and other
friendly countries outside Europe.

2 France


Since the end of the Cold War, France has focused on
maintaining independence of its defense policies, while
having led initiatives to enhance the defense structure and
capability in Europe. It has worked on the development of
its military capacity by streamlining and integrating military
bases, dealing with operational requirements to strengthen
its defense capability, as well as enhancing its intelligence
capabilities and modernizing equipment required in the
future.
The Defence and National Security Strategic Review
announced by the Macron administration in October 2017


states that the threats that France faces, including domestic
terrorism, the refugee issue, and the Ukraine crisis, are
diversifying, increasing in complexity, and rapidly becoming
more violent, and amidst the increasingly multipolar
international system, competition is intensifying among
major military powers and the danger of escalation is growing.
Under these conditions, France will fulfill its duties within
NATO, including for collective defense and contributing to
security, and will take a leading role in efforts to strengthen
the EU’s defense capabilities. In June 2018, the Military
Planning Law for 2019-2025 was enacted, consisting of
four pillars –human resources, equipment modernization,
contributions to Europe’s strategic independence, and
technological innovation – to materialize the national security
strategy given in the Strategic Review. The law confirms a
plan to allocate a total of approximately 300 billion euros to
defense by 2025 to fulfill President Macron’s commitment to
the goal of raising defense spending to 2% of France’s GDP
by 2025.
France has been conducting airstrikes against ISIL in Iraq
since September 2014 and in Syria since September 2015.[28]

Following the terror attacks in Paris in November 2015,
France declared a state of emergency, and decided to deploy
10,000 military personnel to maintain domestic security and
suspend troop reductions. The country enhanced its airstrikes
against ISIL in Syria and deployed mobile units including the
aircraft carrier Charles de Gaulle to the Mediterranean Sea.
France has continued to provide education and training to the
Iraqi Security Forces and Peshmerga, as well as humanitarian
assistance for refugees.
Since France has territories in the Indo-Pacific region,

it places importance on its commitment to the region.[29]
The Strategic Review points out the potential for a threat
to interests, such as the freedom of navigation, due to the
worsening strategic situation in the Asia-Pacific region, and
clearly states that France will maintain its stance of protecting
the sovereignty of its overseas territories in the Pacific Ocean
and the Indian Ocean. France has cited Australia and India as
major strategic partners in the Indo-Pacific region.[30] During
his visit to Australia in May 2018, President Macron stated
that the Paris-Delhi-Canberra axis is absolutely key for the
Indian-Pacific region. In addition, France has proactively
organized the multilateral exercises Croix du Sud and
Equateur in the South Pacific. In February 2018, France had
the Floréal class frigate Vendémiaire make a port call in Japan
and conduct joint exercises with the MSDF. In March 2019,

27 In February 2019, Defence Secretary Williamson announced that the United Kingdom would deploy the aircraft carrier Queen Elizabeth in the Mediterranean, Middle Eastern and Pacific

28 As of July 2018, France had mobilized 1,100 personnel, 10 Rafale fighters, 1 frigate, among other assets.
29 As of June 2018, France had at least 200,000 of its citizens in the Indo-Pacific region, stationing about 7,000 soldiers in the region.

a carrier strike group including the aircraft carrier Charles
de Gaulle left France, and conducted a multilateral exercise
with Australian, U.S. and Japanese ships including MSDF
Destroyer JS “Izumo” in May, when the group was deployed
in the Indian Ocean. Furthermore, France dispatched
Falcon 200 reconnaissance aircraft to support measures to
implement UN Security Council resolutions related to North
Korea, conducting warning and surveillance operations
against ship-to-ship transfers involving North Korean ships.
In 2019, the frigate Vendémiaire conducted patrol and
monitoring activities in the seas around Japan, including
the East China Sea. From the viewpoint of enhancing the
effectiveness of the UN Security Council resolutions, Japan
and France engaged in cooperation activities, including
information sharing.

3 Germany


While Germany has been implementing a large-scale
reduction of its military personnel since the end of the Cold
War, it has been gradually expanding the dispatch of its federal
forces overseas. At the same time, Germany has advanced the
reform of its armed forces to enable them to execute multiple
responsibilities encompassing conflict prevention and risk
management in the context of multilateral organizations,
including NATO, the EU, and the UN. However, following
a worsening in the security environment, in May 2016
Germany changed policy and announced that it would
increase military personnel by around 7,000 by 2023.[31]

The country’s defense white paper released in July 2016
for the first time in about 10 years explains that Germany’s

security environment has grown more complex and unstable,


causing gradually rising uncertainty, citing specific threats
such as international terrorism, cyberattacks, interstate
conflict, and the influx of refugees and immigrants. The
white paper also states that Germany would continue to
emphasize multilateral cooperation and cross-government
approaches, while striving to realize rules-based international
order. Furthermore, with regard to the number of military
personnel, the white paper notes that although an upper limit
was in place following the end of the Cold War and Germany
has continually worked to reduce personnel, it would shift
to a policy with no upper limit and perform regular reviews
of its military force plan to adjust the number of personnel
flexibly.
In Iraq, Germany has provided education and training
to the Iraqi Security Forces since 2015. In December 2015
following the terror attacks in Paris in November 2015,
Germany expanded logistics support missions, such as
reconnaissance and aerial refueling, for the Coalition that
was conducting counter-ISIL military operations. [32]

With regard to the Asia-Pacific region, Germany
considers it to be important from the standpoint of its large
population and economic strength, and expresses the view
that the region plays a central role in international politics.
However, Germany has allocated most of its military assets
for NATO and EU missions outside the Asia-Pacific region
and limited its military engagement in the region to disaster
relief missions and goodwill visits, failing to participate in
joint exercises involving naval ships in the region. Given
that Germany is attempting to enhance its naval power by
launching four new frigates by 2020, the German Navy’s
future engagement in the regional will attract attention.


**Chapter**


31 Germany decreased its military personnel strength which was once more than 500,000 at the time of its reunification to 250,000 by 2010. In 2016, personnel were cut further back to
177,000. However, since July 1994, when the Federal Constitutional Court judged that dispatching the federal forces to international missions under multilateral frameworks such as the
United Nations and NATO was constitutional, Germany has gradually expanded dispatch of its federal forces to participate in various international operations, including security maintenance
and reconstruction activities in the Balkan Peninsula and Afghanistan, and anti-piracy operations off the coast of Somalia and in the Gulf of Aden.

32 The decision was made on the following commitment during the 12-month period from early January to end of December 2016: (1) dispatch the frigate Augsburg to escort the French
aircraft carrier Charles de Gaulle; (2) deploy Tornado fighters (up to six fighters) and aerial refueling aircraft to Incirlik Air Base in Turkey; and (3) deploy up to 1,200 personnel to areas of
ISIL’s operations in Syria, their airspace, the eastern Mediterranean Sea, Persian Gulf, and Red Sea to collect intelligence using reconnaissance satellites and share this intelligence with
relevant countries. This decision also added the dispatch of personnel to NATO’s AWACS (early warning and control aircraft) unit to the mission. Furthermore, Germany strives to reduce the

equipped drones have the potential to conduct fl exible
operations with AI recognizing adversary actions and
battle condition changes, they are expected to exert a great
infl uence on the military sphere.
The U.S. Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency
(DARPA) is developing AI-equipped unmanned aerial
vehicles (UAVs), including small UAVs that are air-launched,
recovered and reused for swarm fl ights for intelligence,
surveillance, and reconnaissance (ISR) missions,[6] as well as
drone ships[7] for fi nding submarines. The U.S. Air Force is
developing autonomous UAVs to support manned aircraft. In
addition, in “2018 DoD Artifi cial Intelligence (AI) Strategy”
released in February 2019, the DoD indicates that it will
articulate its vision and guiding principles for using AI in a
lawful and ethical manner.
The Chinese government released “Next Generation
Artifi cial Intelligence Development Plan” in 2017,
expressing its intention to become a global AI innovation

center by 2030.[8] In June 2017, China Electronics Technology
Group Corporation displayed a swarm fl ight of 119 fi xedwing UAVs equipped with AI. In May 2018, it successfully
performed a swarm fl ight of 200 drones, demonstrating its
advanced technology to allow numerous UAVs to fl y while
keeping a distance from each other. The Caihong-7 (CH-7),

1 General Situation


Recent developments in science and technology have
impacted a variety of areas, triggering signifi cant and
revolutionary changes in many areas such as economy,
society, and lifestyle. The military sphere is no exception.
Major countries place emphasis on developing weapons
utilizing cutting-edge technologies, such as unmanned
technology (e.g., drones),[1] autonomous technology
leveraging artifi cial intelligence (AI), big data analysis,[2]
and hypersonic technology.[3] Recently, reports have been
published of successful tests and planned deployment of
electromagnetic railguns[4] and high-power laser weapons[5]
that are expected to provide more effective fi repower than
existing weapons, such as artillery, in terms of cost per fi ring,
range, precision, promptness, and other aspects. Further
technological innovation is expected to dramatically change
battle scenes in the future.

2 High-tech Weapon Development Trends


**(1) AI Autonomous Drones**

The United States, China and Russia are developing
autonomous drones equipped with AI. Given that AI

**Chapter**


Drones developed for military use include unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV), unmanned ground vehicle (UGV), and unmanned maritime vehicle (UMV) (UMVs may be classifi ed into unmanned
surface vehicles [USV] and unmanned underwater vehicle [UUV]).

In the “Third Offset Strategy,” the United States has given the example of “deep-learning machine” technology using AI, which can analyze big data for indications and warning of cyber
attacks.

For example, in the United States, Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) and the Air Force are engaged in joint research and development of the Hypersonic Air-breathing
Weapon Concept (HAWC), aiming to apply the technology to hypersonic missiles, etc. in the future. Unlike cruise missiles that use jet engines to fl y at subsonic speed, HAWC uses the
technology of the scramjet engine, which enables hypersonic fl ight by taking in air at hypersonic speed and burning it without reducing the speed to below the speed of sound.

The electromagnetic railgun is a weapon that shoots projectiles by using the magnetic fi eld generated from electric energy instead of gunpowder. The U.S. Forces are developing a railgun
with a range of about 370 km, or about ten times that of the existing 5-inch (127 mm) gun. A single railgun shot reportedly costs 1/20th to 1/60th the price of a missile.

The U.S. Forces are developing laser weapons to strengthen low-altitude air defense capabilities against small boats and drones. Tests have been carried out to shoot down unmanned
aircraft by using lasers in efforts to put the technology to practical use.

DARPA has announced plans to carry out fl ight tests in 2019 with the aim of testing the airborne launch and recovery of unmanned aircraft.

The Anti-Submarine Warfare Continuous Trail Unmanned Vessel (ACTUV) (“Sea Hunter”) is capable of navigating several thousand kilometers for months without crewmembers on board
through constant remote supervision by humans. In August 2016, this vessel allegedly completed its initial sea trials.

“Next Generation Artifi cial Intelligence Development Plan” sets goals of AI development by 2030 according to three steps. At the fi rst step by 2020, “overall AI technology and application
reach a globally advanced level”; at the second step by 2025, “some technologies and applications achieve a world-leading level”; and at the third step by 2030, “AI theory, technology and

international aerospace show in November 2018, is described
as a fi ghter UAV that can perform advanced autonomous
fl ights.[9]

Russia is developing a nuclear-powered underwater drone
(named Poseidon) that can carry nuclear warheads, claiming
that the drone has been tested successfully. In addition, a test
fl ight of Okhotnik, an unmanned stealth fi ghter jet pointed
out to be operated in coordination with manned aircraft, was
conducted in August 2019. The Russian government has
published a video of the fl ight.
Some have argued that drones with AI and autonomous
functions could develop into so-called Lethal Autonomous
Weapons Systems (LAWS). Within the framework of
the United Nations Convention on Certain Conventional
Weapons (CCW), discussion on LAWS is continued from
the perspectives of their characteristics, human element, and
international law.
Meanwhile, some people indicate that UAVs would not
become as autonomous as human pilots until 2040.

**(2) Hypersonic Weapons**

The United States, China and Russia are developing
hypersonic weapons, including hypersonic glide vehicles
(HGVs) that would be launched from ballistic missiles,
maneuvered to glide at hypersonic speed (Mach 5 and
above) after their entry into the atmosphere, and hit targets,
as well as hypersonic cruise missiles (HCMs) using scramjet
engines and other technologies that enable hypersonic fl ight
by utilizing incoming supersonic airfl ow to be maintained at
the speed of sound or faster for combustion. It is suggested
that hypersonic weapons would fl y in lower orbits longer and
be more maneuverable than ballistic missiles, being more
diffi cult to detect or intercept.
The United States in its Missile Defense Review
(MDR) (January 2019) indicates that Russia and China are
developing advanced hypersonic missile capabilities that
challenge existing missile defense systems.[10]

China has been developing multiple models of HGVs
since 2012.[11] It is suggested that these HGVs would be
deployed as early as 2020. On the other hand, Russia has
claimed that it has developed an HGV called “Avangard”[12]
and would deploy it within 2019. It has asserted that existing
and future missile defense networks would fail to counter
the Avangard. Russia is also developing a hypersonic cruise

missile called “Zircon.”[13]


**(3) Electromagnetic Railgun**

The United States and China are developing electromagnetic

railguns that use electromagnetic fi elds generated from
electric energy to launch projectiles. Unlike missiles,
projectiles for electromagnetic railguns have no propulsion
systems and are smaller, less costly and stored in smaller
space. If electromagnetic railguns are made available
for intercepting missiles, they may reportedly be able to
effi ciently counter numerous missiles.
The United States achieved a range of 185 km and a
projectile impact speed of Mach 5 in tests in December 2010,
planning to mount electromagnetic railguns on warships by
2025. It plans to use electromagnetic railguns not only for
anti-ground and anti-ship attacks but also for anti-aircraft
attacks.


9 It is pointed out that China plans to introduce not only drones but also a decision-making support system using artificial intelligence for supporting nuclear-powered submarine
commanders.

10 The United States is developing an HGV called Advanced Hypersonic Weapon (AHW). In October 2017, it conducted an improved version’s fl ight test in which the AHW fl ew about 3,700 km
and hit a target.

11 Multiple fl ight tests have been conducted.

12 In a fl ight test conducted in December 2018, the Avangard fl ew over an estimated distance of 6,000 km and hit a target.

13 In the State of the Union address in February 2019, the Zircon was described as capable of fl ying at the maximum speed of about Mach 9 to hit a maritime or ground target more than 1,000

Peresvet laser weapon system[16] and developing a megawattclass chemical laser weapon system for attacking satellites.

**(5) Quantum Science & Technology**

Quantum science and technology is positioned as an
important technology to innovate society by applying
quantum mechanics that differs from familiar physics
that people sense every day. For example, quantum
cryptographic communications use quantum cryptographic
technology taking advantage of quantum characteristics for
cryptographic communications that cannot be deciphered
by third parties. It is pointed out that quantum radar may be
able to neutralize the stealth of stealth aircraft by utilizing
quantum characteristics.
China developed the approximately 2,000 km-long,
world’s longest quantum cryptographic communications
network between Beijing and Shanghai. In addition, in August
2016, China launched “Mozi,” the world’s first satellite to test
quantum cryptographic communications. In January 2018,
China said that it succeeded in using Mozi for long-distance
quantum cryptographic communication between China
and Australia. In the United States, DARPA is conducting
research and development on quantum cryptographic
communications and quantum laser technologies. Going
forward, new technologies such as quantum cryptography
communications could potentially be applied to the military
field in various countries.


It is pointed out that China has tested its railguns at sea
and would deploy them by 2025.

**(4) High-power Laser Weapons**

The United States, China and Russia are developing highpower laser weapons to destroy targets with laser energy.
Laser weapons are expected as an effective and less
costly means to intercept attacks by multiple small drones
and boats.[14] Given the speed of light and the absence of
constraints on ammunition, laser weapons, if strengthened
enough to intercept missiles, could be able to efficiently
counter massive missile attacks.
The United States has tested a 30 kW ship-based solid laser
weapon system (LaWS) to counter small unmanned aerial
vehicles (UAVs) in the Persian Gulf since 2014, planning to
test mount an Aegis ship with the 100 kW HELIOS solid
laser weapon system available for countering projectiles by
2020. It has also indicated the effectiveness of using a highpower laser weapon system to intercept a ballistic missile in
the boost phase,[15] assessing technology for mounting drones
with laser weapon systems.
China exhibited the 30-100 kW “Silent Hunter” laser
weapon system, capable of countering small UAVs, at the
IDEX 2017 international defense exhibition. It is pointed out
that China is developing higher-power laser weapon systems
to attack satellites.
It is suggested that Russia is test deploying the 10 kW

**2** **Trends Concerning Defense Technological and Industrial Bases**


In recent years, Western countries in particular have
continued to face difficulties in increasing defense budgets
significantly. On the other hand, the sophistication of
military science and technology, and the greater complexity
of equipment have escalated development and production
costs and have raised unit prices for equipment procurement.
Under these circumstances, many countries are taking on a
variety of initiatives in order to maintain and enhance their
national defense technological and industrial bases.
Western countries have set a target to increase
competitiveness through realignment of their defense
industry, based on the aforementioned situation related to
national defense budgets. The United States has experienced
repeated mergers and integrations among domestic
corporations, while Europe has experienced cross-border


mergers and integrations of the defense industry, especially
in Germany, France, the United Kingdom, and Italy. In
response to the escalation of development and production
costs, Western countries are promoting joint development
and production and technological cooperation related to
equipment among their allies and partners. This move
aims for (1) splitting development and production costs,
(2) expanding demand in all countries participating in joint
development and production, (3) mutual complement of
technologies, and (4) raising domestic technology levels by
obtaining the latest technology.
For example, the joint development and production of
the F-35 fighter jet led by the United States is the largest
joint program. At present, there is anticipated demand for
more than 3,200 aircraft.[17] This project will have impacts


14 For terrorists’ use of UAVs, see Part I, Chapter 3, Section 7
15 It is pointed out that a ballistic missile in the boost phase before taking anti-interception measures could be the most vulnerable to interception.
16 In the State of the Union address in February 2019, it is explained that the Peresvet laser weapon system would enter full operation in late 2019.
17 There are nine countries involved in the joint development and production of the F-35 fighter jets: Australia, Canada, Denmark, Italy, the Netherlands, Norway, Turkey, the United Kingdom,
and the United States. The other countries acquiring them are Israel, the ROK, and Japan, whose defense technological and industrial bases is involved in their production and maintenance.

on the defense technological and industrial bases of the
countries involved, through the operation, sustainment and
maintenance stages of the aircraft. The European Union
(EU) has created the European Defence Fund (EDF)[18] to
provide funding for joint research and development by the
EU member states in order to promote their cooperation in
developing and acquiring defense equipment and facilitate
the efficient production of state-of-the-art and interoperable
equipment.
There is an increasing number of cases where governments
are providing funding for national defense-related research
and development conducted by the private sector. In the
United States, for example, approximately US$3.44 billion
in research and development funding was requested for FY
2019 for DARPA,[19] whose mission is to make investments
in breakthrough technologies that will contribute to national
security. The U.S. defense authority has long provided
substantial funding for the research conducted by companies
and universities. In some other countries, such as the United
Kingdom and Australia, responding to the utilization of
dual-use technologies in defense equipment development,
the governments have launched initiatives to provide
funding for private sector research and development on
innovative technologies in order to acquire advanced civilian
technologies.[20]

Countries have exported equipment overseas since the

Export (2014 - 2018)


Cold War era, and still today, many countries are taking
measures to promote exports. While Western countries
exporting advanced equipment have remained as leading
defense equipment exporters, countries such as China, the
Republic of Korea (ROK), and Turkey have been expanding
exports of affordable equipment along with the development
of the manufacturing bases required for production of
equipment with the past imports of equipment and the
improvement of capabilities in science and technology.
Defense equipment imports by Asian and Oceanian
countries have continued an uptrend in recent years,
underpinned by economic growth in the region as well as the
expansion of Chinese influence, the existence of territorial
disputes, and responses to the military buildup in neighboring
countries.
Some of defense equipment importing countries adopt
offset policies[21] in order to keep a good balance between
improving defense capabilities through imports and
developing domestic defense technological and industrial
bases by requesting domestic companies’ participation in
parts production as a condition for procuring equipment and
services from abroad.

**2** **Trends in Space Domain**


**1** **Space Domain and Security**


Nearly 60 years have passed since a satellite was launched
into outer space for the first time in the history of mankind.
In recent years, technology leveraging outer space has been
applied to various areas. While no state is allowed to own
outer space, all countries can use it freely. Major countries
thus make proactive efforts to use outer space.[1] For example,
Earth observation satellites, such as meteorological satellites,
are used to observe weather as well as land and waters;
communication and broadcasting satellites are used for the
Internet and broadcasting; and positioning satellites for global
positioning systems are used to navigate aircraft and ships.
These satellites have widely prevailed in social, economic,
scientific, and other areas as essential infrastructure for the
public and private sectors.
In the security field, military forces in major countries
are actively involved in outer space activities and utilize a
variety of satellites. There is no concept of national borders in
outer space, meaning that the utilization of satellites enables
the observation of, communication at, and positioning on
any area on the Earth. Thus, major countries make efforts
to enhance the capabilities of a variety of satellites and
launch them for the purpose of enhancing C4ISR functions.[2]
Such satellites include image acquisition satellites for
reconnoitering military facilities and targets, early warning
satellites for detecting the launch of ballistic missiles,
satellites for gathering radio signals, communication
satellites for communications between military units, and
positioning satellites for navigating naval vessels and aircraft
and enhancing the precision of weapons systems. In outer
space, various countries are thus rapidly developing their
capabilities to ensure their military superiority.
From the viewpoint of ensuring their military superiority,
various countries are also rapidly developing their capabilities
to impede each other’s use of outer space. In January 2007,
China conducted a test to destroy its aging satellite with a
ground-launched missile. The resulting space debris[3] spread
across the satellite’s orbit, and came to be seen as a threat


against space assets such as satellites owned by various
countries.[4]

Furthermore, countries including China and Russia
are thought to be also developing an anti-satellite weapon
(ASAT) that does not directly hit and destroy a satellite by a
missile, thus creating less space debris. For example, it has
been noted that ASATs under development include a “killer
satellite” to approach a target satellite and utilize a robot arm
to capture the target and disable its functions. On this point, it
has been noted that China has carried out experiments in outer
space in which they have mobilized satellites close to other
satellites to simulate the movements of a killer satellite. The
United States has claimed to have confirmed very unnatural
moves of a satellite launched by Russia in 2017 for checking
space systems, indicating concerns about the satellite.
Furthermore, it has been pointed out that China and Russia
are developing not only missiles and killer satellites but also
jammers for interfering with communications between target
satellites and ground stations, and laser weapons for attacking
target satellites with directed energy. It has also been noted
that China and Russia have been enhancing capabilities to
operate these anti-satellite capabilities and impede the United
States and its allies from using outer space.[5]

As the above illustrates, the risk to the stable use of outer
space has become one of the critical security challenges for
countries, thus it has become necessary to deal with this risk
effectively in an effort to ensure stability in the use of outer
space.
Against this backdrop, the existing international
agreements, such as the Outer Space Treaty (the Treaty
on Principles Governing the Activities of States in the
Exploration and Use of Outer Space, Including the Moon and
Other Celestial Bodies) that prescribes the exploration and use
of outer space, do not have direct provisions on prohibiting
the destruction of space objects and refraining from actions
triggering space debris. Discussion on guidelines has been
under way recently by the United Nations Committee on the


**Chapter**


The Outer Space Treaty (The Treaty on Principles Governing the Activities of States in the Exploration and Use of Outer Space, Including the Moon and Other Celestial Bodies) that came into
force in October 1967 defines such matters as the use of the Moon and other celestial bodies for peaceful purposes, the freedom in principle of exploration and use of outer space, and the
prohibition of ownership. According to one of the concepts, outer space is considered to be the airspace more than 100 km above the Earth’s surface. However, no clear international
agreement has been reached on the definition of outer space.

The term “C4ISR” stands for command, control, communication, computer, intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance. The 1991 Gulf War is considered “the first high-tech war
conducted in outer space in the history of mankind.”

Unnecessary artifacts orbiting around the Earth, including satellites no longer in use, and launch vehicles’ upper stages, parts, and fragments.

According to an April 2018 issue of the Washington Times (National Digital Edition) of the United States, China carried out an experimental launch of an anti-satellite missile in February
2018. Moreover, it was reported that Russia also carried out an experimental launch of an anti-satellite missile in March 2018.

As there is no concept of national borders in outer space, **Laser laboratory aircraft (A-60)**
artifi cial satellites can be used to collect information
from and conduct communications and positioning at

satellite-based space systems as military infrastructure.

warning satellites for detecting ballistic missile fi rings, and
communications satellites for enabling communications
between distant units.
As military forces grow dependent on space systems, some countries are developing and improving anti-satellite (ASAT)
weapons in order to prevent enemies from working effectively in military operations by depriving their satellite of function.
For example, it is pointed out that China and Russia are continuing to develop and test “ASAT missiles” launched from the
ground or aircraft for physically destroying satellites, “killer satellites” for directly colliding with other satellites or using
robot arms to catch other satellites and deprive them of function, “directed-energy weapons” for emitting high-power laser
beams to deprive satellites of function or directly destroy them, and “jammers” for disrupting communications between
satellites and ground stations.
Under such situation, the U.S. Department of Defense has recognized that China and Russia are considering counterspace
capabilities as a means to weaken the military effectiveness of the United States and its allies, promoting initiatives to
maintain relative advantages in space, including a bill sent to Congress to create a space force as a new military service.

The United States launched its fi rst satellite, Explorer 1, in
January 1958, following the satellite launches by the former
Soviet Union. The country has since then proceeded with
a variety of space activities in fi elds including military,
science, and resource exploration, such as launching the
world’s fi rst reconnaissance satellite and landing on the
Moon. Today, the United States is the world’s leading space
power. The U.S. Forces clearly recognize the importance of


the Earth, and threats caused by meteors reaching Earth, in
addition to threats posed by anti-satellite weapons and space
debris to space assets.

outer space for their actions, and on this point, actively utilize
outer space for security purposes. In June 2010, the United
States released the National Space Policy that presents the
country’s basic guidelines for space policy. The National
Security Strategy (NSS) revealed in December 2017 points
out that many countries are said to have purchased satellites
to back up their strategic military activities, and some
countries even pursuing a variety of ASATs on the basis
of belief that the capability to attack assets in outer space
will give them asymmetrical advantages. But having noted


In 2007, the chairperson of the United Nations Committee on the Peaceful Uses of Outer Space (UN COPUOS) proposed to discuss “the long-term sustainability of outer space activities” in
relation to civil space activities, for the purpose of defi ning risk reduction for long-term sustainable activities and equal access to outer space. Based on this proposal, discussions have
taken place towards working out some guidelines. Among other international discussions on the use of outer space, there are talks on the development projects of the WOOMERA Manual
on the International Law of Military Space Operations as well as the Manual on International Law Applicable to Military Uses of Outer Space (MILAMOS) that discuss new legal problems

that, the United States indicated that unlimited access to and
freedom in activities in outer space were vital interests of the
United States, and that the long-term goals in outer space
were given consideration by the National Space Council in
an effort to develop strategies. The National Space Strategy
was announced in March 2018, which demonstrated its
recognition that their adversaries had turned space into a
warfighting domain, and that the United States would seek
to deter, counter, and defeat threats in the space domain
that are hostile to the national interest of the United States
and its allies. Based on these strategic guidelines, the U.S.
DoD has set the goal of maintaining and strengthening U.S.
space superiority for security purposes, recognizing that the
United States needs to prepare for the possibility of conflict
extending into outer space. In this regard, President Donald
Trump directed the DoD in June 2018 to build a space force
that would be separate from the other military branches
such as the army, the navy and the air force, and ordered
the Pentagon in December 2018 to establish the United
States Space Command as a unified combatant command.[7]

In February 2019, the DoD submitted a proposal to Congress
that would see the creation of the space force within the
Department of the Air Force.
Among U.S. government organizations, the National
Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) under
direct control by the President is responsible mainly for
non-military space development, while the DoD undertakes
military research, development, and operation of observation
and reconnaissance satellites.

2 China


China began working on space development in the 1950s,
and in April 1970, the county launched its first satellite
“Dong Fang Hong I,” mounted on the transportation launch
vehicle “Long March 1,” using technology enhanced through
its missile development.
China has thus far conducted activities such as manned
space flight and lunar rover launches. It is speculated that
China’s space development is intended to enhance national
prestige and develop space resources.
China’s defense white paper “China’s Military Strategy”
(May 2015) states that outer space is a commanding position


Launch of BeiDou 42 and 43, a Chinese satellite positioning system by China on

in strategic competition among all nations. Meanwhile, China
asserts that its activities in outer space constitute “peaceful
use of outer space,” and underscores that China is “opposed

[to] the weaponization of and arms race in outer space, and

[will take] an active part in international space cooperation.”
China also commits to “[keep] abreast of the situation of
outer space, deal with security threats and challenges in that
domain, and secure its space assets.” In addition, “China’s
Space Activities in 2016,” China’s white paper on space
activities released in December 2016, presents a vision to
“build China into a space power” and for “the realization
of the Chinese Dream.” It also presents a schedule of space
vehicle launches[8] up to 2020.
While traditionally emphasizing international cooperation
and the peaceful use of space, China has fallen short of
denying its military use of space and proactively used space

for military purposes, including information collection,
communications,[9] and positioning. In fact, it is pointed out
that China launched 29 military satellites as of November
2018, exceeding six for the United States and eight for
Russia.[10] Furthermore, as described earlier, China continues
to develop ASATs. In January 2007, China conducted a
test using a ground-launched missile for destroying its own
satellite. In July 2014, China implemented an anti-satellite
missile test that was not accompanied by the destruction of
any satellite.[11] It is also suggested that China is developing
killer satellites, jammers, and directed-energy weapons,[12]
including laser beams.


**Chapter**


7 At present, the Joint Force Space Component Command under the control of the U.S. Strategic Command operates the U.S. Forces’ outer space capabilities.

8 The paper cites not only a lunar rover but also the launch of worldwide services using the BeiDou Navigation Satellite System, Mars exploration, asteroid exploration, and Jupiter
exploration. As for space exploration, it was announced in January 2019 that China’s Chang’e 4 became the world’s first vehicle to land on the moon’s far side.

9 In August 2016, China launched the world’s first quantum science satellite, called Mozi, which will be carrying out a proof-of-concept mission for quantum communication between space
and a ground station.

10 Source: “Union of Concerned Scientists”
11 The February 2015 “Worldwide Threat Assessment” of the U.S. Director of National Intelligence notes that in July 2014, China tested an anti-satellite missile without destroying a satellite.
12 According to the “Annual Report to Congress: Military and Security Developments Involving the People’s Republic of China” published by the U.S. DoD in May 2018, China continues to
develop directed-energy weapons, electronic countermeasure systems (jammers), and a variety of capabilities, including the capability to counter satellites, designed to limit or block the

It is reported that China is developing and operating
satellites that can be used for both military and civilian
purposes. For example, the possibility of military use of
the BeiDou satellite positioning system[13] has been pointed
out, as it has been reported that the purpose of the launch
of global service in 2018 was to satisfy military needs.
A Chinese state-owned corporation, which develops and
produces satellite carrier rockets, has claimed to continue the
launch of new rockets in the Long March series and develop
a launch vehicle that can carry a large satellite.[14] However,
the corporation has been reported to have been developing
and producing ballistic missiles as well, indicating that
the development of satellite carrier rockets is applicable to
that of ballistic missiles.[15] China is thus expected to focus
on space development through close cooperation between
government, military, and private sectors.
China is considered to have become one of the space
powers through investments, research and development,
and the introduction of technologies from the United States
and other countries. It has been suggested that China could
threaten U.S. superiority in outer space in the future.[16]

Among organizations, the Strategic Support Force,
established in December 2015 as a force under direct control
by the Central Military Commission, is pointed out as being
in charge of outer space, cyber, and electronic warfare, while
the details of its missions and organization have not been
published. The Equipment Development Department of the
Central Military Commission is believed to be in charge of
launching, tracking and controlling satellites and conducting
manned space programs. The State Administration for
Science, Technology and Industry for National Defense,

which belongs to the State Council’s Ministry of Industry and
Information Technology, works out and implements spacerelated programs. The China National Space Administration
takes charge of civilian programs and represents the
Chinese Government externally by concluding international
agreements.

3 Russia


Russia’s space activities have been continuing since


the former Soviet Union era. The former Soviet Union
successively launched multiple satellites after it launched the
first satellite in the history of mankind, Sputnik 1, in October
1957, and had the largest number of launched satellites in
the world until the collapse of the former Soviet Union. The
satellites included many military satellites, and progress was
made in the use of space for military purposes by the United
States and the former Soviet Union during the Cold War
era. Russia’s space activities have declined since the former
Soviet Union collapsed in 1991. However, the country has
recently started to expand its space activities once again.
Regarding the country’s trends in security, the National
Security Strategy of the Russian Federation, approved in
December 2015, states that the opportunities for maintaining
global and regional stability are shrinking significantly
with the deployment of the U.S. weapons in outer space. In
response to the United States’ release of the annual MDR in
2018, Russia expressed concern that the implementation of
plans in the MDR would launch an arms race in space with
hugely negative consequences for world peace and stability.
In March 2016, Russia released the Federal Space
Program for 2016-2025 as a specific future guideline for
space activities, including the development and deployment
of domestic space satellites and manned flight programs.
Meanwhile, Russia has taken advantage of its space
capabilities for military operations. In its air assault
operation in Syria in 2015, Russia reportedly used a total of
10 satellites, including image gathering satellites as well as
data relay satellites (a kind of communications satellites),
to ascertain Syrian domestic conditions. It is also pointed
out that Russia has repeated tests to fire ground-launched
anti-satellite missiles and has been developing anti-satellite
missiles to be launched from Mig-31 fighter jets. In the
Russian Far Eastern city of Vostochny, Russia has almost
completed its space center and is reportedly constructing
a new launching site. Future moves, including the military’s
engagement with the center, are attracting attention.[17]

From an organizational perspective, the Roscosmos
State Corporation for Space Activities is in charge of space
activities related to Russia’s scientific and economic areas,
while the Russian Ministry of Defence is involved in space


**Chapter**


13 BeiDou offers not only positioning services but also interactive short message services. It is suggested that the services allow naval ships using the BeiDou system to identify locations of
foreign ships and other information and provide the information to other BeiDou-using ships on a real-time basis, contributing to improving maritime and other information gathering
capabilities.

14 As for the Long March 9 rocket (for launching very large satellites), which can lift a satellite of up to 140 tons into a low orbit and is reportedly planned for launching such vehicles as
manned lunar landers, its developers said in October 2018 that the first Long March 9 would be launched between 2028 and 2030.

15 Moreover, it is regarded that China is focusing also on the development of satellite earth stations and operating a space base for civilian use in Patagonia, Argentina. Furthermore, the
country has launched a manned space program with the aim of constructing its own space station.

activities for security purposes. The Russian Aerospace
Force[18] conducts actual space activities for military purposes,
manages facilities for launching satellites, among other
activities.

4 Europe


Regarding European outer space activities, the EU, the
European Space Agency (ESA)[19], and European countries
are promoting their own unique space activities and are
cooperating with each other to implement space activities.[20]
France succeeded in launching its own satellite for the first
time in 1965, and the United Kingdom in 1971. Italy and
Germany used launch vehicles developed by the United
States to own satellites in 1964 and 1965, respectively.
Meanwhile, the ESA launched its first satellite in 1979.
The ESA signed a “framework agreement” with EU in
2004 to prescribe that they will coordinate on proceeding
with space development and hold regular minister-level
council meetings. The joint council meeting held by the ESA
and the EU in 2007 approved the European Space Policy. The
European Space Policy mentions improving synergy effects
between space activities for civil and defense purposes,
and the importance of implementing space activities based
on coordinated efforts among member states and ensuring
an internationally competitive space industry. The policy
identifies security as one of its areas of priority.
The EU and ESA are planning a satellite positioning system
“Galileo” and an Earth observation program “Copernicus,”
and European Defense Agency (EDA)[21]is implementing a
reconnaissance satellite project “Multinational Space-based

Imaging System (MUSIS).”[22] It is believed that in the future
these initiatives will be utilized for the security field in
Europe.


positioning and observation satellites. At the end of January
2019, it released a space mission calling for promoting
research and development on a manned space initiative by
2020.[23]

India is believed to have operated a positioning satellite
that can position locations around India[24] and launched an
Earth observation satellite, which is believed to be also used
for security purposes. In February 2017, India successfully
launched a satellite launch vehicle loaded with 104 satellites
at low cost,[25] marking the largest number ever carried
on a single rocket in the world, which indicates its high
technological capabilities. In March 2019, Prime Minister
Modi announced that the country successfully tested a
missile to shoot down a low-orbit satellite.
Among organizations, the Space Agency oversees
the Indian Space Research Organization (ISRO), which
implements space development policy, develops and launches
launch vehicles, and develops and manufactures satellites.

6 The ROK


The ROK is considered to have started full-scale space
development from the latter half of the 1990s. Current space
development is promoted based on the Third Basic Space
Development Promotion Plan announced by the Moon
administration under the Space Development Promotion Act
implemented in 2005. The plan proposes a vision towards
2040, giving priority to (1) the establishment of its own
launch vehicle technology, (2) the advancement of satelliteusing services and satellite development, (3) the initiation of
space exploration, and (4) the development of the Korean
Positioning System (KPS).
In November 2018, the ROK, which had traditionally
depended on other countries for launching satellites,
announced that it successfully tested the Nuri domestic
launch vehicle under development.
Among organizations, the Korea Aerospace
Research Institute leads research and development as an

India has promoted programs to develop communications,


18 According to the Russian Ministry of Defence, the Aerospace Forces were created by merging the Air Force and the Aerospace Defence Forces, and started performing its tasks in August
2015. The tasks of the Aerospace Forces include: (1) providing focused combat command to the air force; (2) conducting aerial and missile defense; (3) launching and controlling satellites;
(4) warning about missile attacks; and (5) monitoring outer space.

19 The ESA was established in May 1975 based on the ESA Convention targeting to establish a single European space organization focusing on the peaceful use of space research,
technology, and application areas. The organization was formally established in October 1980.

20 In September 2000, the European Commission (EC) and the ESA created the European Strategy for Space, which committed to pursue Europe’s coherent and effective space activities. The
strategy envisioned that the EC would make political and strategic decisions on space policies and that the ESA would function as the implementing organization. For the satellite
positioning system “Galileo” currently in operation and the environmental and security monitoring program “Copernicus,” the EU and ESA are complementing each other in carrying these
projects forward, with the former mainly taking charge of the policy dimension and the latter the technical dimension.

21 The EDA was established in 2004 to improve Europe’s defense capabilities for crisis management purposes and to execute and maintain security and defense policies.
22 The MUSIS was started by Belgium, Germany, Greece, France, Italy, and Spain. The organization was joined later by Poland in December 2010. This is a joint project succeeding such
projects as “Helios 2” (a French military reconnaissance satellite), “Pleiades” (a French Earth imaging satellite used for military and civilian purposes), “SAR-Lupe” (a German group of
military radar satellites), “COSMO-SkyMed” (an Italian constellation of Earth observation satellites), and “Ingenio” (a Spanish optical satellite).

23 In December 2014, the ISRO succeeded in the test launch of a large launch vehicle carrying an unmanned capsule.
24 In April 2016, India succeeded in launching the seventh satellite constituting the Indian Regional Navigation Satellite System (IRNSS).
25 All 104 satellites were launched and placed into polar orbit at the same time. They comprised India’s roughly 700 kg Cartosat-2D Earth observation satellite and 103 small satellites

**Section**
**3** **Trends in Cyber Domain**

**1** **Cyberspace and Security**


Owing to the advancement of information and
communications technology (ICT) in recent years,
information and communications networks such as the
Internet have become essential components across all facets
of life. Therefore, cyber attacks[1] against information and
communications networks have the potential to seriously
impact the lives of individuals.
Types of cyber attacks include functional disruption, data
falsification and data theft caused by unauthorized access to
information and communications networks or through the
transmission of viruses via e-mail, functional impairment
of the networks through simultaneous transmission of large
quantities of data, and attacks intended to shut down or
take over a system belonging to critical infrastructure, such
as power systems. Also, Internet-related technologies are
constantly evolving, with cyber attacks becoming more and
more advanced and sophisticated by the day.[2]

For military forces, information and communications
capability form the foundation of command and control,
which extend from central command to ground-level forces.
In this regard, ICT advancements are further enhancing
the dependence of military forces on information and


use of various satellites.

communications networks. Furthermore, in some cases,
military forces need various critical infrastructures, including
electricity, to execute their missions. Accordingly, cyber
attacks against such critical infrastructures could become a
major impediment to their missions. For this reason, cyber
attacks are recognized as an asymmetrical means to impede
the military activities of adversaries at low cost. It is believed
that many foreign military forces are developing offensive
capabilities in cyberspace. It has been pointed out that
China and Russia in particular are bolstering the offensive
cyber capabilities of their militaries for the purpose of
obstructing the networking of military forces and destroying
infrastructure.[3]

In addition, actors (including non-state actors) attempting
to cause harm to nations, etc. are likely to realize that
attacking through cyberspace is often easier than attacking
directly by physical means.[4] Moreover, it is said that the
information and communications networks of countries are
being compromised for the purpose of gathering intelligence.
As more confidential information is stored in cyberspace,
information theft through cyber attacks is causing more
serious damage.


**Chapter**


**2** **Threats in Cyberspace**


Under such circumstances, cyber attacks have frequently
been carried out against information and communications
networks of government organizations and military forces
of various countries.[5] Government agencies are suspected


of engaging in some cyber attacks. Military forces in China,
Russia, and North Korea are believed to be enhancing their
cyber attack capabilities.


The targets of cyber attacks are wide-ranging. Beginning with large targets, they range from global-level targets, including inter-state targets, as well as national and government
institutions, local communities, business communities and, infrastructures, companies, and individuals. As such, it is said that measures to counter cyber attacks need to be optimal relative
to the size of the target.

In the Japanese Ministry of Defense (MOD)’s “Toward Stable and Effective Use of Cyberspace” of September 2012, cyber attacks are characterized as follows: (1) diversity: cyber attacks
involve diverse actors, methods, objectives, and context; (2) anonymity: actors can easily conceal and disguise their identity; (3) stealth: some cyber attacks are difficult to identify and can
take place without causing any realization of damage; (4) offensive dominance: attack tools are easy to acquire depending on the tool, and it is difficult to completely eliminate software
vulnerabilities; and (5) the difficulties of deterrence: retaliatory strikes and defensive measures have minimal deterrence effect.

According to the “Worldwide Threat Assessment” by the Director of the U.S. Defense Intelligence Agency (March 2018).

According to the “Cybersecurity National Action Plan” unveiled by then U.S. President Obama in February 2016.

According to the annual report presented to Congress by the U.S. Office of Management and Budget based on the Federal Information Security Management Act, the number of
cybersecurity incidents reported to federal offices in FY2017 in the U.S. was 35,277. Moreover, the “Worldwide Threat Assessment” of January 2019 by the U.S. Director of National
Intelligence names China, Russia, Iran, and North Korea as those that pose the greatest cyber threats to the United States. It also indicates (1) that China presents a persistent cyber
espionage threat and a growing attack threat to U.S. core military and critical infrastructure systems, (2) that Russia poses a cyber espionage, influence, and attack threat to the United
States and its allies, (3) that Iran presents a cyber espionage and attack threat, and (4) that North Korea poses a significant cyber threat to financial institutions, remains a cyber espionage

conducted extensive cyber attacks on private enterprises,
academic organizations and other targets over a long term.

2 Russia


It has been revealed that the Russian military has its own
cyber commando unit, which is believed to be responsible for
conducting offensive cyber activities,[11] including inserting
malware into command and control systems of adversaries.[12]

It is pointed out that Russia has taken advantage of
cyberspace for intelligence operations to challenge democratic
processes,[13] and has been involved in the following incidents.

-  In 2014, more than 500 million user accounts were leaked
from a major U.S. Internet company. In March 2017, the
U.S. government indicted four hackers, including two
officers of the Russian Federal Security Service (FSB), for
their alleged cyber attack on the company.[14]

-  In December 2015, a cyber attack triggered a large-scale
power outage in Ukraine. It was reported that military
forces of Russia confronting with Ukraine over the Crimea
annexation and other issues were suspected of having
contributed to the cyber attack.

-  Cyber attacks to affect the outcome of the 2016 U.S.
presidential election.[15]

-  In June 2017, cyber attacks using the so-called NotPetya
ransomware occurred in Ukraine and other countries. In
February 2018, the U.S. and U.K. governments attributed
the attacks to the Russian military.

-  In October 2018, the U.S. and U.K. governments
announced that the Main Intelligence Directorate of the
General Staff of the Russian Armed Forces was responsible

for cyber attacks on the World Anti-Doping Agency, the


1 China


According to China’s defense white paper called “China’s
Military Strategy” (May 2015),[6] China will expedite the
development of a cyber force. Furthermore, it has been
pointed out that cyber warfare units have been formed
under the Strategic Support Force that was created as part
of China’s military reforms[7] in late December 2015. The
units are estimated to consist of 175,000 troops, including
30,000 for cyber attacks, indicating that China is enhancing
its military’s cyber warfare capabilities.
China is suspected of conducting cyber attacks to steal
confidential information even in peacetime.[8] For example, its
involvement in the following incidents has been pointed out.

-  In June 2015, the U.S. Office of Personnel Management
(OPM) became a target of a cyber attack in which, as it later
came to light, personal information of about 22 million
people, including U.S. federal employees and U.S. Forces
personnel, were stolen.[9]

-  In January and February 2018, Chinese government
hackers hacked a U.S. Navy contractor, leading to a leak
of classified information on supersonic anti-ship missiles
mounted on submarines.[10]

-  In December 2018, such countries as the United States
announced that the APT10 cyber group related to China’s
Ministry of National Security conducted cyber attacks on
intellectual and other properties in at least 12 countries.
The United States pointed out that the APT10 group
implemented cyber attacks on government agencies of
these countries and stole defense, space, aviation, resources
development, and other information from U.S. companies.

Even in Japan, it has been confirmed that the APT10 group


**Chapter**


6 The defense white paper notes that “cyberspace has become a new pillar of economic and social development, and a new domain of national security,” that “as international strategic
competition in cyberspace has been turning increasingly fiercer, quite a few countries are developing their cyber military forces,” and that China is “one of the major victims of hacker
attacks.”

7 While the details of the Strategic Support Force’s tasks and organization have not been revealed, it is suggested that it is in charge of outer space, cyber, and electronic warfare. See Part I,
Chapter 2, Section 2 regarding the Strategic Support Force.

8 According to the DoD Cyber Strategy released in September 2018, Chinese cyber attacks involve a range of organizations, including the People’s Liberation Army (PLA), intelligence
agencies, security agencies, private hacker groups, and companies. The Annual Report of the U.S.-China Economic and Security Review Commission (November 2016) notes that China
carries out cyber espionage led by the Ministry of State Security and military organizations as well as cyber espionage led by China’s many non-state actors targeting the United States.
These actors include hackers contracted by the government, civilian “patriotic hackers,” and criminal organizations.

9 See the Annual Report of the U.S.-China Economic and Security Review Commission (November 2015). In addition to this attack, the report states that a U.S. airline company was attacked
by the same method as that used in the attack against the U.S. OPM.

10 The United States deems that China continues to conduct cyber-enabled theft targeting a broad set of U.S. interests ranging from national security information to sensitive economic
information and U.S. intellectual property. While the United States and China have agreed to refrain from cyberespionage of intellectual property, it has been pointed out that cyber
espionage by China still continues unimpeded.

11 According to a statement made by Russian Minister of Defence Shoigu during a briefing for the lower house in February 2017, the Russian military has a cyber command for the defensive
purpose of countering political propaganda in Russia’s ongoing information war with Western countries. It is pointed out that the number of Russia's cyber troops comes to approximately
1,000.

12 According to then U.S. Director of National Intelligence Clapper’s written testimony on “Worldwide Cyber Threats” at the House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence in September
2015.

13 According to the “DoD Cyber Strategy” released in September 2018.
14 There was another cyber attack on this Internet company in 2013, resulting in the leaking of information on approximately 3 billion people.
15 According to the joint statement issued in October 2016 by the U.S. Department of Homeland Security and the director of National Intelligence of the United States, and the joint report
issued in December of the same year by the U.S. Department of Homeland Security and the FBI concerning Russian cyber attacks on the United States, as well as the U.S. intelligence
community report on Russia’s cyber attacks on the U.S. presidential election released in January 2017. Moreover, during the 2017 presidential campaign in France, Macron, known as a
hardliner on Russia, was reportedly a target of a cyber attack, as well as a widespread fake news story about having hidden assets in a tax haven. After being appointed president, in a joint

U.S. Democratic convention, and other targets.

3 North Korea


It has been pointed out that the North Korean authority trains
hackers [16] and has intensively built up cyber units operating
some 6,800 personnel.[17]

North Korea is believed to have been developing
capabilities to steal money and secret military information
through cyber attacks and inflict such attacks on key foreign
infrastructure. It is suspected of having been involved in the
following incidents.

-  In September 2016, cyber attacks occurred in the internal
network of the ROK Armed Forces. In May 2017, the
ROK Ministry of National Defense was reported to have
concluded that the cyber attacks had been conducted by
what was believed to be a North Korean hacker group.[18]
Moreover, it has been pointed out that documents containing
military secrets were stolen through the cyber attacks.

-  In May 2017, a cyber attack used a malware called WannaCry
to encrypt and neutralize electronic data held by hospitals,
schools, businesses, and other entities in more than 150
countries. The Japanese, U.S., and U.K. governments
blamed North Korea for the attack.[19] It has been pointed
out that this cyber attack succeeded in collecting 140,000
dollars in Bitcoins.

-  In September 2017, multiple U.S. electric power utilities
were inflicted with cyber attacks using spear phishing
emails. In October 2017, FireEye, a U.S. cybersecurity
company, announced that the attacks had been conducted

by a cyber threat group allegedly affiliated with North
Korea.

-  In February 2018, according to the ROK National


Intelligence Service, North Korea has repeatedly hacked
the ROK exchanges for the purpose of stealing virtual
currencies, and it has succeeded in acquiring the equivalent
of several dozen billion won (several billion yen).

-  In March 2019, a final report by an expert panel of the
United Nations Security Council’s North Korea Sanctions
Committee pointed out that North Korea conducted at
least five cyber attacks on virtual currency exchanges in
Japan and other Asian countries between January 2017
and September 2018, stealing a total of 571 million dollars
(about 63 billion yen).

4 Trends Concerning Other Threats


Supply chain risks, including products embedded with
deliberately and fraudulently altered programs, and the
existence of advanced malware designed to attack industrial
control systems are also pointed out. In this respect, the
U.S. Congress in August 2018 passed the National Defense
Authorization Act of 2019 including provisions prohibiting
government agencies from using products of major Chinese
communications equipment manufacturers, such as Huawei
Technologies Co. The United States has provided its
allies with information about risks accompanying Chinese
communications equipment and urged them not to use
such equipment. In response, Australia has banned China’s
Huawei and ZTE Corporation from taking part in its 5G
next-generation mobile network development project.
Cyber attacks on telecommunication networks of a
government and military forces or on critical infrastructure
could have a serious effect on the security of states, and it is
believed that state-sponsored cyber attacks have been on the
rise in recent years. Given this situation, there is a need for
continuous monitoring of trends in the threats in cyberspace.


**Chapter**


**3** **Initiatives against Cyber Attacks**


Given these growing threats in cyberspace, various initiatives
are under way.[20]

A number of issues have been raised that need to be dealt


with to enable an effective response to be taken to cyber

16 According to the “2016 Defense White Paper” published by the ROK in January 2017, it is said that North Korean cyber-related organizations are linked to the authority, and spot talented
human resources from all over the land, giving them special training to develop cyber forces.

17 According to the “2018 Defense White Paper” published by the ROK in January 2019. In November 2013, it was reported that Kim Jong-un, then First Secretary of the Korean Workers’
Party of North Korea, stated, “Cyber attacks are omnipotent swords with their power paralleled with nuclear power and missiles.”

18 According to the digital ROK National Defense Report in May 2017. Furthermore, the report revealed that some of the IP addresses (Internet addresses) used in the attacks were identified
as those in the Shenyang region of China, known to have been used by existing North Korean hackers.

19 Japan, the United States, the United Kingdom, Australia, Canada, and New Zealand issued a statement of condemnation. Moreover, according to JPCERT/CC, over 2,000 devices at 600
locations in Japan are said to have been infected.

20 Generally, the trends at the governmental level are thought to include the following: (1) organizations related to cybersecurity that are spread over multiple departments and agencies are
being integrated, and their operational units are being centralized; (2) policy and research units are being enhanced by establishing specialized posts, creating new research divisions and
enhancing such functions; (3) the roles of intelligence agencies in responding to cyber attacks are being expanded; and (4) more emphasis is being given to international cooperation. At
the level of the defense ministry, various measures have been taken, such as establishing a new agency to supervise cyberspace military operations and positioning the effort to deal with

cyberspace, including how international law applies. For
instance, the United States, Europe, and Japan have called
for maintaining a free cyberspace, while Russia, China, and
most emerging countries sought to strengthen state control
on cyberspace. Against this backdrop, there has been a
movement to promote the rule of law in cyberspace in the
international community. For instance, discussions are being
held on the establishment of international rules within the
framework of global conferences on cyberspace.[21]

in and through cyberspace that pose long-term strategic risk
to the United States as well as to its allies and partners.[23]
The strategy presents such approaches as (1) the acceleration
of cyber capability development, (2) defense to counter
and deter malicious cyber activity, and (3) the promotion
of cooperation with U.S. allies and partners. In April 2019,
U.S.-Japan Security Consultative Committee (two-plustwo) convened, where the two countries agreed to enhance
cooperation on cyber issues and affi rmed that international
law applies in cyberspace and that a cyber attack could, in
certain circumstances, constitute an armed attack for the
purposes of the U.S.-Japan Security Treaty.
The U.S. Forces include Cyber Command, which was
elevated to a unifi ed combatant command in May 2018, to
control cyberspace operations. The Command consists of
the Cyber Protection Force, which operates and protects the
information infrastructure for the cyber forces of the U.S.
Army, Navy, Air Force, and Marine Corps and for the DoD,
the National Mission Force, which supports U.S. defense
against national-level threats, and the Combat Mission
Force, which supports the operations conducted by unifi ed
combatant commands on the cyber front (these three forces
are collectively referred to as the Cyber Mission Force[24]).[25]


1 The United States


In the United States, the Department of Homeland Security
is responsible for protecting Federal government networks
and critical infrastructure against cyber attacks, and the
Department’s Offi ce of Cybersecurity and Communications
(CS&C) works to protect the networks of government
agencies.[22]

The U.S. National Security Strategy (December 2017)
points out that many countries now view cyber capabilities
as tools for projecting infl uence and that cyberattacks have
become a key feature of modern confl ict. It also notes that
the United States would deter, defend, and when necessary
defeat malicious actors who infl ict cyber attacks on the United
States. To this end, the U.S. strategy came up with policy
(1) to improve ability to attribute cyberattacks and allow for
rapid response, (2) to enhance cyber tools and expertise to
protect U.S. government assets, critical infrastructure, and
information, and (3) to improve the integration of authorities

and procedures across the U.S. government so that cyber
operations against adversaries can be conducted as required.
The U.S. DoD in its National Defense Strategy (January
2018) described a policy of investing in cyber defense,
resilience, and the continued integration of cyber capabilities
into the full spectrum of military operations. Furthermore,
the DoD Cyber Strategy (September 2018) points out that the
United States is engaged in a long-term strategic competition
with China and Russia, and that China and Russia have
expanded that competition to include persistent campaigns

21 Global conferences on cyberspace have been held since being proposed by the then U.K. Foreign Secretary Hague in 2011, and the series of conferences has been called the “London
Process.” The conferences have been attended by the governments, international organizations, groups from the private sector, NGOs, etc., of over 100 countries, and comprehensive
discussions are held on various issues regarding cyberspace. They are high-level, large-scale global conferences, and the most recent one was held in November 2017.

22 The U.S. Department of Homeland Security announced a cybersecurity strategy in May 2018. More than 20 billion devices are expected to become connected to the Internet by 2020, and
this is also said to increase the risks.

23 The DoD Cyber Strategy indicated a view that, while China is eroding U.S. military overmatch and economic vitality by exfi ltrating sensitive information from U.S. public and private sector
institutions, Russia has used cyber-enabled information operations to infl uence the U.S. population and challenge U.S. democratic processes.

24 According to the DoD, the Cyber Mission Force has 133 teams (13 National Mission Teams, 68 Cyber Protection Teams, 27 Combat Mission Teams and 25 Support Teams), comprising 6,200
persons.

25 U.S. Cyber Command, which had been subordinate to U.S. Strategic Command, was elevated to a unifi ed combatant command in May 2018, allowing the CYBERCOM commander to report
directly to the U.S. Secretary of Defense as is the case with other unifi ed combatant command commanders. In announcing the elevation of U.S. Cyber Command to a combatant command,
the U.S. DoD has stated that the domain of cyberspace is just as important for military operations as land, sea, and air, and that operational capabilities in cyberspace are indispensable for

were adopted in June 2011: (1) clarify the political and
operational mechanisms of NATO’s response to cyber attacks;
(2) clarify that NATO would provide assistance to member
states to develop their cyber defense, and provide assistance
to member states if they are subject to cyber attacks; and (3)
set out principles on cooperation with partners. Furthermore,
at the NATO Summit in September 2014, agreement was
reached that NATO’s collective defense applies to cyber
attacks against member states.
On the organizational front, in November 2017, an
agreement was reached on the creation of a new Cyber
Operations Center and the integration of NATO member
countries’ cyber defense capabilities into NATO missions
and operations. The Cyber Operations Center located in
Belgium is expected to be fully operational with cyber attack
capabilities by 2023. Furthermore, NATO has conducted
cyber defense training exercises annually since 2008 to
heighten cyber defense capabilities. In addition, NATO
has expanded cooperation with the EU in the fields of
cybersecurity and cyber defense.[26]

In 2008, the NATO Cooperative Cyber Defence Centre
of Excellence (CCDCOE) was authorized to serve as a
research and training institution,[27] and was established in
Estonia’s capital of Tallinn. CCDCOE carries out research
on the relationship between cyber activities and international
law, creating the “Tallinn Manual.”[28] In February 2017,
“Tallinn Manual 2.0” was published as the second edition of
the previous manual based on a review of broad discussion
points, from peacetime legal regimes, such as laws on state
responsibility, human rights, aviation, space, and maritime
affairs, to contingency legal regimes, such as laws on armed

conflict.

3 The United Kingdom


The United Kingdom, in its “NSS- SDSR2015” released in
November 2015, committed to investing £1.9 billion over the
next five years in increasing its cyber defense capabilities
to strengthen the functions for identifying and analyzing


cyberspace threats. In November 2016, the country
announced a new “Cyber Security Strategy” that presents a
vision for the United Kingdom, which is to be secure and
resilient to cyber threats, prosperous and confident in the
digital world. To achieve this vision, the Strategy requires the
United Kingdom to deter cyber threats by having effective
defensive and offensive means and to “develop” cuttingedge technologies.
On the organizational front, in October 2016, the National
Cyber Security Centre (NCSC) was newly established under
the Government Communications Headquarters (GCHQ) to
promote public-private partnerships for responses to national
cyber incidents.

4 Australia


In its first “National Security Strategy” published in January
2013, Australia positions integrated cyber policies and
operations as one of the top national security priorities. In
April 2016, a new “Cyber Security Strategy” through 2020
was released, which provides that Australia will ensure the
safety of the people, that private companies will participate
in cybersecurity, and that threat information will be shared.
On the organizational front, cybersecurity capabilities
across the government were converged to establish the
Australian Cyber Security Center (ACSC), which addresses
major cybersecurity issues related to government agencies
and critical infrastructures.[29] In July 2015, the ACSC issued
its first report on cybersecurity,[30] which contends that the
number, type, and sophistication of cyber threats to Australia
are all increasing. Moreover, cyber forces were established

within the military in July 2017 to strengthen the Department
of Defence’s cyber capabilities and systems.[31]

26 In July 2016, NATO and the EU signed a Joint Declaration with the aim of expanding cooperation in dealing with new issues, such as those involving terrorism, refugees and immigrants,
including the cybersecurity issues. They have been strengthening cooperation, for example, by exchanging information on cyber defense.

27 In June 2013, the NATO Defense Ministers’ Meeting placed cyber attacks at the top of the agenda for the first time. They agreed to establish an emergency response team and to
implement a cyber defense mechanism on a full scale by October 2013.

28 The “Tallinn Manual” and the “Tallinn Manual 2.0” are both considered independent outputs of the members that participated in the project (Professor Michael N. Schmitt of the U.S. Naval
War College served as project leader; members included professionals, scholars on international law, and experts in cyber technology in the West and other areas), and not the official view
of NATO.

29 The ACSC, comprised of staff from the Australian Crime Commission, the Australian Federal Police, the Australian Security Intelligence Organisation, the Australian Signals Directorate, and
the Australian Federal Computer Emergency Response Team, and the Defence Intelligence Organisation, analyzes cyber threats and responds incidents in both private and public sector.

30 According to the report, malicious actors in cyberspace targeting Australia are: (1) foreign government-sponsored adversaries; (2) serious and organized criminals; and (3) groups motivated
by certain issues and individuals with personal grievances.

31 According to “International Cyber Engagement Strategy” announced in October 2017, the country’s offensive cyber capability in support of military operations will be deployed through the
Signals Directorate in cooperation with the Australian Force.

32 Under the Director of the National Intelligence Service, the National Cybersecurity Strategy Council has been established to deliberate on important issues, including establishing and

to cyber attacks. It places particular emphasis on strengthening
the following five areas: prevention, detection, response,[33]
systems, and security base. In the national defense sector, the
Cyber Measures Technology Team was established by the
Ministry of National Defense to respond to cyber and hacking
threats. The sector has also worked out procedures for quick
response to cyber crises under the “National Cyber Security


Strategy and the National Cybersecurity Crisis Response
Manual.” In 2015, the Joint Chiefs of Staff centralized the
cyber attack tactical system mainly around the Joint Chiefs
of Staff by newly establishing the Cyber Tactics Department,
assigning control authority concerning cyber tactics to the
Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, and issuing a field
manual on “joint cyber tactics.”

domains as electronic warfare, cyber and space.
It is reported that PLA electronic warfare units routinely
conduct jamming operations against communication and

reported that China has mounted electronic warfare pods for
jamming missions on J-15 fi ghters, H-6 bombers, and other
aircraft, and deployed a jamming system on Mischief Reef of
the Spratly Islands.[4]


3 Russia


Russia, in its federal Military Doctrine, positions electronic
warfare equipment as important equipment in modern
military confl ict. It is pointed out that Russian forces have
positioned electronic warfare as part of offensive means and
improved practical electronic warfare capabilities in recent
years.[5]

Russia’s electronic warfare force reportedly has fi ve

used various electronic warfare systems in eastern Ukraine
to block Ukrainian forces’ command and control traffi c and
jam GPS waves to interrupt their drone operations, affecting
Ukraine’s military performance.[7] It is also reported that
Russia used Krasukha-4 and other electronic warfare systems
in Syria to interrupt NATO forces’ command and control

electronic reconnaissance aircraft’s long-range fl ights over
the Sea of Japan have been seen.

**Electronic Warfare**

Electronic warfare generally represents battles in which **Laser weapon system**
radio and other electromagnetic waves are used. In
general, the warfare is divided into three categories –
electronic attack, electronic protection, and electronic
warfare support.
An electronic attack emits more powerful or deceptive
radio waves toward adversaries’ communications and
radar systems to jam radio waves from these systems so
as to reduce or neutralize adversaries’ communications

weapon system and the Russian Peresvet.

**Giraffe 8A**

See  Part I, Chapter 3, Section 1-1-2 (4) (High-Power Laser
Weapons)

Electronic protection includes making defense
equipment too stealthy to be detected and reducing or
neutralizing adversaries’ electronic attacks by changing
electromagnetic wave frequencies or enhancing
electromagnetic wave power in response to an electronic
attack on communications and radar systems. For example,

jamming.

Electronic warfare support means collecting
adversaries’ electromagnetic wave data. To implement
effective electronic attack or protection, it is required to recognize and analyze electromagnetic waves used by adversaries’
communications, radar systems and electronic attack aircraft and how these waves are used under normal circumstances.
In electronic warfare, it is desirable to implement effective electronic protection even without adversaries’ jamming
waves recognized or analyzed in advance. In this respect, using artifi cial intelligence technology for defense equipment
is under consideration to immediately analyze jamming waves and automatically select frequencies that are the most
invulnerable to jamming.

**5** **Maritime Trends**


Japan is a maritime nation surrounded by sea, and depends
on maritime transportation for importing energy resources.
In this sense, securing maritime traffic safety is vital for the
nation’s existence. At the same time, ensuring the stable
use of the maritime domain as infrastructure supporting
international logistics is recognized as a primary concern for
the international community.

**1** **Trends Related to the “Principle of the Freedom of the High Seas”**


The UN Convention on the Law of the Sea (UNCLOS)[1]
provides for the principles of freedom of navigation in the high
seas and freedom of overflight. Nevertheless, in the waters
and airspace in the periphery of Japan, especially the East
and South China Seas, it has become increasingly common
for countries to unilaterally assert their rights or take actions,
based on their own assertions which are incompatible with
the existing international order. This has caused situations of
undue infringement upon such principles.


Nevertheless, some countries unilaterally claim their
rights or take actions based on their own assertions that are
incompatible with the existing international order, leading
the principle of the freedom of the high seas to be violated
unduly. On the other hand, piracy seen at various locations
has become a threat to maritime traffic.

China’s Ministry of National Defense announced that
it would require aircraft flying in the zone to follow their
instructions and warned that China’s armed forces would
adopt “defensive emergency measures” in the event that
aircraft refuse to follow the instructions. Japan is deeply
concerned about such measures, which are profoundly
dangerous acts that unilaterally change the status quo in the
East China Sea, escalating the situation, and that may cause
unintended consequences in the East China Sea. Furthermore,
the measures unduly infringe the freedom of over flight.
Japan is demanding China to revoke any measures that could
go against the principle of freedom of over flight. The United
States, the Republic of Korea (ROK), Australia, and the EU,
too, have expressed concern about China’s establishment of
such zone. Increased activities by Chinese military aircraft
have been confirmed in recent years in the airspace close
to the various southwestern islands of Japan, including the
main island of Okinawa, and the expansion of these activities
may be an attempt to enforce ECS ADIZ. Moreover, in May
and June of 2014, fighters of the PLA flew abnormally close
to aircraft of the MSDF and ASDF, which were flying over
the East China Sea.[3]


**Chapter**


**(1) East China Sea**

Numerous cases of acts which go against the principles of
freedom of navigation and freedom of overflight have been
recently seen in the East China Sea. For example, there was
the case in January 2013, when a Chinese naval vessel directed
its fire-control radar at an MSDF destroyer navigating on the
high seas (30th), and another case in which a Chinese naval
vessel is suspected to have directed its fire-control radar at a
helicopter carried onboard an MSDF destroyer (19th). The
directing of a fire-control radar is generally an act carried
out prior to using firearms, and directing it at an opponent
is a dangerous act that may have unintended consequences.[2]

On November 23, 2013, the Chinese Government
announced that it would establish “the East China Sea Air
Defense Identification Zone (ECS ADIZ),” including the
Senkaku Islands as if they were a part of China’s territory.


**(2) South China Sea**

Such actions have also been seen frequently in the South
China Sea. Chinese naval vessels have obstructed the


The UN Convention on the Law of the Sea (UNCLOS) was adopted as a comprehensive treaty on the law and order of the seas in 1982 and entered into force in 1994 (Japan concluded it in
1996).

Regarding this issue, the U.S. issued statements saying “actions such as this escalate tensions and increase the risk of an incident or a miscalculation, and they could undermine peace,
stability, and economic growth in this vital region (February 5, 2013, Department of State Daily Press Briefing)” and that “we were briefed by our Japanese allies on the incident and we’ve
satisfied ourselves that it does appear to have happened (February 11, 2013, Department of State Daily Press Briefing).”

Other than that, there were multiple incidents in March 2011 of Chinese helicopters and other aircraft apparently of the State Oceanic Administration flying close to Japan Maritime SelfDefense Force destroyers which were engaged in monitoring and surveillance in the East China Sea. Moreover, in June 2016, a Chinese fighter is speculated to have conducted a
dangerous act by approaching a U.S. Air Force reconnaissance aircraft at a high speed over the East China Sea, and in May 2017 an incident allegedly occurred where Chinese fighters

navigation of U.S. naval vessels[4] and Chinese aircraft
have also obstructed the flight of U.S. military aircraft.[5] In
December 2016, an unmanned underwater vehicle belonging
to the U.S. Navy was momentarily seized in the South China
Sea by a vessel of the PLA Navy. These cases are dangerous
acts that could cause unintended consequences.
Additionally, China has gone ahead with land reclamation
on seven features on a massive and rapid scale on the Spratly
Islands since 2014. In July 2016, the “historical rights”
asserted by China as the basis of the “nine dash line” were
denied in the arbitration award between the Philippines and
China, and the illegality of China’s reclamation activities
was acknowledged. However, China has clearly stated
its intention not to comply with the award, and continues
militarization of the features by developing batteries and
other military facilities and various infrastructure that can be
used for military purposes, such as runways, harbors, hangars
and radar facilities. Moreover, in July and August 2016 after
the arbitration award between the Philippines and China
was rendered, an H-6K bomber of the PLAAF conducted
combat air patrols in the airspace around Scarborough Shoal,
with China’s Ministry of National Defense announcing
that it would conduct these patrols regularly from now on.
This shows the PLA has been intensifying its operation in
the South China Sea. Under these circumstances, a further
increase in China’s aerial presence in the area could lead
to the establishment of a “South China Sea Air Defense
Identification Zone” in the future.
Furthermore, Chinese government vessels have obstructed
fishing and other vessels of other countries approaching the
features, etc. by ring warning shots and water cannons at the
vessels. Claimants as well as the international community
including the United States have repeatedly said they are
deeply concerned about China’s unilateral changes of the
status quo, further advancement of efforts to create a fait

**2** **Addressing Piracy**


Piracy seen at various locations has become a threat to
maritime traffic. The number of maritime piracy and armed
robbery incidents (hereinafter referred to as piracy incidents)
in the world[7] came to a peak of 445 in 2010, 439 in 2011,
and 197 in 2012, indicating a downtrend (the number stood


accompli, and assertive and dangerous acts that could cause
unintended consequences.

**(3) Unintended Contingency Avoidance Initiatives**

Despite these numerous acts that could pose risks to securing
the stable use of oceans and airspace, in recent years progress
has been made on efforts to avert and prevent unintended
consequences in the seas and skies. First, at the Japan-China
Summit Meeting held on May 9, 2018, Japan and China
agreed to establish a “Maritime and Aerial Communication
Mechanism between Japan-China Defense Authorities” with
the aim of avoiding unintended confrontations between the
naval vessels and aircraft of the SDF and PLA.
As for multi-national initiatives, in April 2014, navies
of participating countries of the Western Pacific Naval
Symposium (WPNS), including Japan, the United States,
and China, adopted the Code for Unplanned Encounters at
Sea (CUES).[6] CUES sets forth a code of conduct such as
procedures and communication method to ensure safety for
unexpected encounters by vessels or aircraft of the navies
of each country. In November 2014, the United States and
China agreed on measures pertaining to mutual notification
of military activities, together with rules of behavior to avert
collisions in waters and airspace in accordance with CUES
and other frameworks. In September 2015, the two countries
announced an agreement concerning an additional annex
stipulating rules of behavior to avert air encounters. Between
ASEAN and China, official discussions have been held
between on the establishment of the Code of the Conduct of
Parties in the South China Sea (COC).
It is strongly hoped that these initiatives designed to avert
and prevent unintended consequences in the seas and skies
will supplement the existing international order, and that the
countries concerned, including China, refrain from unilateral
actions that heighten tension and act on the basis of the
principle of the rule of law.

at 201 in 2018). The decline has depended heavily on the fall
in the number of piracy incidents in waters off the coast of
Somalia and in the Gulf of Aden.
The number of piracy incidents in waters off the coast
of Somalia and in the Gulf of Aden rose rapidly from 2008


In March 2009, Chinese ships, including a naval vessel, a maritime research ship of the SOA, a Bureau of Maritime Fisheries’ patrol ship, and fishing vessels, approached a U.S. Navy
acoustic research ship operating in the South China Sea to obstruct its operations, while in December 2013, a Chinese naval vessel cut across the bow of a U.S. Navy cruiser operating in
the South China Sea at point blank range.

In August 2014, a Chinese fighter is speculated to have flown abnormally close to and obstructed a U.S. Navy patrol aircraft over the South China Sea. Furthermore, in May 2016, Chinese
fighters are speculated to have flown abnormally and dangerously close, to within around 15 meters, of a reconnaissance aircraft of the U.S. Navy over the South China Sea.

This code is not legally binding and does not supersede the annexes of the Convention on International Civil Aviation and other international treaties.

persistent uptrend, accounting for more than a half of the
global total and attracting great international concern as a
threat to safe navigation. In the recent years, however, the
number of piracy incidents in waters off the coast of Somalia
and in the Gulf of Aden has remained low as a result of
various initiatives taken by the international community
including Japan (the number stood at three in 2018; see Part
III for Japan’s initiatives).
The international counterpiracy initiatives in waters
off the coast of Somalia and in the Gulf of Aden include
counterpiracy operations by the Combined Task Force 151
(CTF151), a multinational force that was created in January
2009 by the U.S. Force-led Combined Maritime Force
(CMF)[8] based in Bahrain. So far, the United States, Australia,
the United Kingdom, Turkey, the Republic of Korea, Pakistan
and other countries have participated in the CTF151,
conducting zone defense operations to counter piracy. The
EU for its part has conducted Operation Atalanta to counter
piracy since December 2008. In the operation, naval vessels
and aircraft dispatched by EU member countries escort ships
and monitor the waters off the coast of Somalia. It has been
decided that the operation will continue until the end of 2020.
In addition, some countries have conducted their exclusive
operations outside the abovementioned frameworks. Since
December 2008, for example, China has deployed naval
vessels for counterpiracy operations in waters off the coast
of Somalia and the Gulf of Aden.

**3** **Trends in the Arctic Ocean**


The area north of latitude 66 degrees 33 minutes is called
the Arctic Region. The Arctic Region includes Canada,
Denmark, Finland, Iceland, Norway, Russia, Sweden and
the United States. These eight are called Arctic countries. In
1996, the Arctic countries established the Arctic Council to
promote cooperation in their common challenges, including
sustainable development and environmental protection in the
Arctic Region.
In recent years, moves towards the utilization of transArctic navigation routes and the development of natural
resources in the Arctic Ocean have gained momentum in line
with a decline in sea ice. From the perspective of security, the


While the number of piracy incidents in waters off the
coast of Somalia and in the Gulf of Aden has remained low
thanks primarily to such international initiatives, Somalia’s
unstable security and poverty as fundamental factors behind
piracy have not been resolved.
Meanwhile, in Africa, piracy incidents occurred in the
Gulf of Guinea (the number of incidents was 82 in 2018).
The international community has continued counterpiracy
initiatives in this region.
The number of piracy incidents in Southeast Asian
waters came to 60 in 2018. Traditionally, maritime armed
robbery incidents, including the theft of cash, crewmembers’
belongings, ship equipment and other items, have accounted
for most of piracy incidents in the waters. In recent
years, however, they included grave incidents in which
crewmembers were kidnapped for ransom purposes in the
Sulu Sea and the Celebes Sea off the Philippines.
Counterpiracy measures in Asia include international
information sharing and cooperation based on the Regional
Cooperation Agreement on Combating Piracy and Armed
Robbery against Ships in Asia (ReCAAP),[9] which was
worked out at Japan’s initiative and put into force in 2006.
In addition, Indonesia, Malaysia, Singapore, and Thailand
conduct the Malacca Strait Patrols.[10] The cases of abduction
for ransom have been confirmed in the Sulu Sea and the
Celebes Sea. In order to respond to this, Indonesia, Malaysia
and the Philippines began sea patrols in the area in June
2017, and air patrols in October of the same year.

Arctic Ocean has traditionally been used for the deployment
of strategic nuclear forces and as their transit route. With the
decrease in sea ice in recent years, ships have been able to
navigate for a longer period of time and more extensively
than before. It is therefore considered that the region could be
used for deploying maritime forces or maneuvering military
forces in the future. In this situation, moves to deploy new
military capabilities in the ocean are seen.
In the Russian Federation’s National Security Strategy
revised in December 2015, Russia continues to maintain that
it would secure its interests in resource development and use
of the sea route.

8 CMF is a multinational force, which operates to promote maritime security, stability, and prosperity, under the U.S. Central Command. Forces from 32 countries participate in CMF, and the
CMF Commander concurrently serves as the Commander of the U.S. Fifth Fleet. CMF is comprised of three combined task forces: Combined Task Force 150 (CTF-150), which is tasked
with maritime security operations; Combined Task Force 151 (CTF-151) with counter-piracy operations; and Combined Task Force 152 (CTF-152) with maritime security operations in the
Persian Gulf. The Japan Self-Defense Forces deploy units to CTF-151.

Russia has been developing natural gas on the Yamal
Peninsula. In 2018, liquefied natural gas produced on the
peninsula was transported to China for the first time via an
Arctic Ocean route. As for military arrangements, Russia has
set up a joint strategic command for each of the four military
districts to unify all of ground, maritime, air and other
forces. In 2014, Russia created the Northern Joint Strategic
Command reportedly to integrate the Northern Fleet with
ground and air forces and cover waters, remote islands
and the Arctic coast between the Barents Sea and the East
Siberian Sea. In the Arctic Region, Russia is constructing 10
airfields. As for military operations, the Northern Fleet has
annually conducted a long-distance navigation to the Novo
Sibirski Islands since 2012. Russia has intensified other
Arctic military operations including SSBN submarines’
strategic nuclear deterrence patrols and long-range bombers’
patrol flights.
In its Arctic Strategy published in 2019, the U.S. DoD
expressed their concern against actions of China and Russia
in the Arctic region,[11] and the DoD would form the basis for
a mutual approach to maintaining a secure and stable Arctic
region. In the Arctic Strategy released by the U.S. DoD in
2013, the United States expresses its desire for the Arctic
to become a secure and stable region where U.S. national
interests are safeguarded, the U.S. homeland is protected,
and nations work cooperatively to address challenges.
The United States reportedly plans to increase the number
of U.S. Marines in Norway on a rotation basis from about


300 to about 700 from 2017. In October 2018, it sent an
aircraft carrier to the Arctic Region for the first time in 27
years for air drills in the Norwegian Sea ahead of the NATO
exercise “Trident Juncture 2018”. In December 2016, then
U.S. President Obama decided to ban new drilling for oil
and natural gas in a majority of U.S. territorial waters in
the Arctic to protect marine resources, showing a negative
stance towards resource development. However, President
Trump signed an executive order repealing this decision of
then U.S. President Obama in April 2017.[12]

Aside from coastal states in the Arctic Ocean, 13 countries
including Japan, China, the ROK, the United Kingdom,
Germany and France have observer status in the Arctic
Council. Notably, China has shown active involvement in the
Arctic Ocean, deploying the polar research vessel Xue Long
to the Arctic Ocean for nine times since 1999.[13] In January
2018, they published a white paper titled “China’s Arctic
Policy” in which they claimed to be one of the geographically
closest states to the Arctic Circle with rights pertaining to
the development of resources. They also announced their
intention to build a “Polar Silk Road.” In September 2015,
it was reported for the first time that five Chinese naval
vessels sailed in the Bering Sea between the Arctic Ocean
and the Pacific and sailed in the U.S. territorial waters near
the Alewtian Islands. Focus will be on whether or not such
activities would have any relation to the PLA Navy’s future
advancements into the Arctic Ocean.

11 As for Russia, the U.S. DoD points out in its Arctic Strategy that Russia is strengthening its presence above the Arctic Circle by deploying Arctic units and establishing new military bases.
Moreover, Russia has reportedly threatened to use force against vessels that fail to abide by Russian regulations. The DoD pointed out that Russia could utilize its military capabilities in an
effort to deny access to disputed Arctic waters or resources. As for China, the DoD pointed out in its strategy that its operations of icebreaking vessels and civilian research activities could
support a future Chinese military presence in the Arctic Ocean including deployment of submarines to the region, and also pointed out that it was attempting to gain a role in the Arctic in
ways that may undermine international rules and norms, and there is a risk that its predatory economic behavior globally may be repeated in the Arctic. In May 2019, during his visit to
Finland, Secretary of State Pompeo made a speech concerning Arctic policy, in which he stated that all relevant parties should follow the same rules and expressed caution against efforts
by China and Russia to expand into the Arctic region.

12 As regards activities of other coastal nations, Canada states that the Arctic is a priority region under its policies in Canada’s Northern Strategy (released in 2009), and in December 2016
Canada announced a moratorium on the development of oil and natural gas in its territorial waters in the Arctic Ocean. Denmark and Norway have also developed the Kingdom of Denmark
Strategy for the Arctic 2011-2020 (released in 2011) and the Norwegian Government’s High North Strategy (released in 2006), respectively, which outline their stances of attaching
importance to the Arctic, including the perspective of security.

13 In 2012, Xue Long became the first polar research vessel to sail across the Arctic Ocean. In 2013, a cargo vessel Yong Sheng became the first Chinese commercial ship to cross the Arctic
Ocean. Canadian scientists took part in Xue Long’s voyage to the Arctic Ocean in 2017, and they succeeded for the first time in trial navigation of the Arctic Northwest Passage (along the

**6** **Transfer and Proliferation of Weapons of Mass Destruction**


The transfer and proliferation of weapons of mass destruction
(WMDs), such as nuclear, biological and chemical (NBC)
weapons, and ballistic missiles that deliver such weapons,
have been recognized as a significant threat since the end of

**1** **Nuclear Weapons**


During the Cold War, the Cuban Missile Crisis of 1962 raised
awareness of the danger of a full-scale nuclear war between
the United States and the Soviet Union. The Treaty on the
Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons (NPT) that took effect
in 1970 prohibited countries other than those that exploded
a nuclear weapon or other nuclear explosive device in or
before 1966[1] from having nuclear weapons, and provided
that arms control and disarmament of nuclear forces would
be pursued through two-way negotiations.[2]

The NPT is currently signed by 191 countries and regions.[3]
While some countries that had previously possessed nuclear
weapons became signatories of this treaty as non-nuclear
weapon states by abandoning these weapons,[4] India, Israel,
and Pakistan still refuse to accede to this treaty as non-nuclear
weapon states. Meanwhile, North Korea has conducted six
nuclear tests, and declared the development and possession
of nuclear weapons.[5]

The Nuclear Posture Review (NPR) released by the Trump
administration in February 2018 states that the United States
“remains committed to its efforts in support of the ultimate
global elimination of nuclear, biological and chemical
weapons.” It also confirms that NPT is a cornerstone of the
nuclear non-proliferation regime and that the United States
continues to abide by its obligations under the NPT and will
work to strengthen the NPT regime.
The Trump administration has expressed its intention to
continue to implement the New Strategic Arms Reduction
Treaty[6] that was signed by the presidents of the United States
and Russia in April 2010 and took effect in February 2011.
However, it has not clarified what to do with the treaty after
its scheduled expiration in 2021, including whether to extend
it. The United Kingdom stated in the Strategic Defence and
Security Review (SDSR) in October 2010 that the country

that non-state actors, including terrorists, against which
traditional deterrence works less effectively, could acquire
and use WMDs.

would decrease the number of its nuclear warheads, and the
NSS-SDSR 2015 released in November 2015 confirmed that
there is no change in this policy to reduce the number of
nuclear warheads.
In the area of “nuclear security” which addresses
terrorist activities that utilize nuclear and other radioactive
materials, the Nuclear Security Summit that commenced at
the proposal of then President Obama has been held on four
occasions. The fourth Nuclear Security Summit that was
held in Washington, D.C. in March-April 2016 adopted a
Communiqué, which shared the recognition that the threat
of nuclear terrorism remains an imminent challenge to the
international community, and which outlined the need for
continuous efforts to prevent nuclear materials from getting
into the hands of non-state actors even after the summit.[7]
The Trump administration has indicated it will promote
cooperation with allies, partners and international institutions
to combat nuclear terrorism.
In February 2019, the Trump administration vowed to
suspend the United States’ obligations under the IntermediateRange Nuclear Forces (INF) Treaty (which is a treaty that
was concluded between the United States and the Union of
the Soviet Socialist Republics to abolish intermediate- and
short-range missiles) with Russia and secede from it in six
months for the reason of Russia’s violation of the treaty.
Following the announcement of withdrawal by the United
States, in March 2019, Russia revealed that it announced
to the United States the suspension of Russia’s obligations
under the INF Treaty. On August 2, 2019, Secretary of State
Pompeo announced that the U.S. withdrawal pursuant to
Article XV of the treaty took effect that day because Russia
failed to return to full and verified compliance. On the same
day, Secretary of Defense Esper announced that the DoD


**Chapter**


The United States, the then Soviet Union (now Russia), the United Kingdom, France, and China. France and China acceded to the NPT in 1992.

Article 6 of the NPT sets out the obligation of signatory countries to negotiate nuclear disarmament in good faith.

As of May 2019

South Africa, Ukraine, Kazakhstan, and Belarus

After North Korea announced its withdrawal from the NPT in 1993, it announced that it would temporarily suspend the validity of that announcement. However, in January 2003, North
Korea gave a notice of the termination of the suspension. In the Joint Statement of the Six-Party Talks adopted in September 2005, North Korea pledged to return to the NPT at an early
date. Nonetheless, North Korea subsequently announced the implementation of six nuclear tests.

The treaty stipulates that each country would reduce the number of deployed strategic warheads to 1,550 and the number of deployed delivery vehicles to 700 in seven years following the
treaty’s entry into force. Both the United States and Russia have claimed that they accomplished the reduction target by February 2018. As of March 2019, the United States had 1,365
deployed strategic nuclear warheads and 656 deployed delivery vehicles, while Russia had 1,461 deployed strategic nuclear warheads and 524 deployed delivery vehicles.

At the Nuclear Security Summit, it was confirmed that the IAEA would play a central role in international nuclear security initiatives. Accordingly, the IAEA hosted the International

will fully pursue the development of intermediate-range,
conventional, ground-launched cruise and ballistic missile
systems, whose test launches, the production and possession
have been restricted by the treaty Meanwhile, Russia
confirmed that the treaty ceased to have effect due to the United
States’ complete withdrawal, and criticized the United States
by saying that all the responsibility for escalating tensions
across the world will rest with Washington. Furthermore,
Russia stated that it is essential to resume full dialogues to
safeguard strategic stability and security, and that Russia is
open to that.
The future course of the bilateral New Strategic Arms

**2** **Biological and Chemical Weapons**


Biological and chemical weapons are easy to manufacture
at relatively low cost and are easy to disguise as most
materials, equipment, and technology needed to manufacture
these weapons can be used for both military and civilian
purposes. For example, water purification equipment used to
desalinate sea water can be exploited to extract bacteria for
the production of biological weapons, and sodium cyanide
used for the process of metal coating can be abused for the
production of chemical weapons.[10] Biological and chemical
weapons are attractive to states and non-state actors, such as
terrorists, seeking asymmetric means of attack.[11]

Biological weapons have the following characteristics: (1)
manufacturing is easy and inexpensive; (2) there is usually
an incubation period of a few days between exposure and
onset; (3) their use is hard to detect; (4) even the threat of use
can create great psychological effects; and (5) they can cause
mass casualties and injuries depending on the circumstances
of use and the type of weapon.[12]

As has been pointed out, advancements in life science
could be misused or abused for the development of biological
weapons. In view of these concerns, in November 2009,


Reduction Treaty scheduled to expire in 2021 is still
uncertain. In this situation, nuclear control and disarmament
trends regarding the United States and Russia will have
to be watched carefully.[8] Meanwhile, China is deemed to
have increased its inventory of nuclear warheads as well
as developed and deployed their means of delivery,[9] and
thereby, continued to enhance the capability of its nuclear
force. In the future, it may be important to launch some
international arms control and disarmament initiative in a
manner to include not only the United States and Russia but
also China and others.

the United States established guidelines[13] on responding
to the proliferation of biological weapons and their use
by terrorists. The guidelines set out that the United States
would take measures to ensure the thorough management of
pathogens and toxins.[14]

As for chemical weapons, Iraq repeatedly used mustard
gas, tabun, and sarin[15] in the Iran-Iraq War.[16] It is believed
that other chemical weapons[17] that were used included VX,
a highly toxic nerve agent, and easy-to-manage binary
rounds.[18] In August 2013, sarin was used in the suburbs of
Damascus, Syria, where Syrian troops clashed with antigovernment groups.[19] The Syrian Government denied using
chemical weapons, but entered into the Chemical Weapons
Convention (CWC) in line with an agreement between
the United States and Russia. Subsequently, international
efforts were undertaken for the overseas transfer of chemical
agents and other measures based on the decisions made by
the Organization for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons
(OPCW)[20] and a UN Security Council resolution.[21] In June
2015, the operation to destroy Syria’s sarin, VX gas, and
other chemical weapons on the U.S. Navy transport vessel

8 In May 2019, at a joint press conference after the U.S.-Russia foreign ministers’ meeting, U.S. Secretary of State Pompeo stated that the United States and Russia had agreed to hold
consultations on arms control in a broader range of fields in addition to the extension of the New Strategic Arms Reduction Treaty. At the U.S.-Russia summit meeting held in June 2019,
the leaders confirmed that the two countries will continue discussion to establish a new framework for disarmament. It is reported that President Trump insisted that China should join the
framework.

terrorists. In the State of the Union Address in January 2010, then President Obama said that the United States was launching a new initiative to respond promptly and effectively to
bioterrorism and infectious diseases.

thousand people at once.

to store and handle than weapons containing chemical agents from the outset.

Cape Ray was completed.[22] In August 2015, in order to
identify users of chemical weapons in Syrian civil war, the
UN Security Council adopted a resolution that establishes a
Joint Investigative Mechanism of the UN and OPCW, and
investigations under this mechanism have been carried out.
In November 2016, the term of this investigative mechanism
was extended for one more year, and efforts have continued
to be made to ensure that chemical weapons would not be
used ever again by identifying those responsible for the use
of chemical weapons. This joint investigation mechanism has
specified persons responsible for six incidents of chemical
weapons use in Syria. It has been reported that four of these
are attributed to the Syrian Army, while the remaining two
incidents were initiated by ISIL.[23][, ][24] In particular, the report
published in October 2017 finds that the Syrian government
was responsible for the use of sarin once again in Khan
Sheikhun, Syria in April 2017. This investigative mechanism
ended its activities in November 2017 after the UN Security
Council failed to adopt a resolution to renew its mandate.
Meanwhile, even after this, there continues to be incidents
where chemical weapons were used in Syria, as suspicions
have been pointed out that chemical weapons were used in
Eastern Ghouta in April 2018.[25] In the same month, the United
States, United Kingdom and France launched missile strikes
on chemical weapons related facilities in Syria after they
determined the Assad regime had used chemical weapons.[26]

**3** **Ballistic Missiles and Other Missiles**


Ballistic missiles enable the projection of heavy payloads
over long distances and can be used as a means of delivering
WMDs, such as nuclear, biological, and chemical weapons.
Once launched, ballistic missiles follow an orbital flight
trajectory and fall at a steep angle at high speed. As such,
effectively countering them requires a highly accurate
interceptor missile system.
The deployment of ballistic missiles in a region where
armed conflict is under way runs the risk of intensifying or
expanding the conflict. Additionally, it has the risk of further
heightening tension in a region where military confrontation
is ongoing, leading to the destabilization of that region.
Furthermore, ballistic missiles are used as a means of


North Korea is an example of an actor that is still
presumed to possess these chemical weapons and which has
not entered into the CWC. In addition, the Tokyo subway
sarin attack in 1995, as well as incidents of bacillus anthracis
being contained in mail items in the United States in 2001
and that of ricin being contained in a mail item in February
2004, showed that the threat of the use of WMDs by terrorists
is real and that these weapons could cause serious damage if
used in cities. Furthermore, the Malaysian police announced
that a VX nerve agent whose production and use are banned
by the CWC was found on the body of Kim Jong-nam who
was assassinated in February 2017. The United Kingdom
criticized Russia over its highly likely involvement in the use
of Novichok, a military-grade chemical weapon developed
by Russia, in the attack on a former Russian intelligence
agent that occurred in the United Kingdom in March 2018.
As punishment, countries including European countries and
the United States expelled Russian diplomats. In September
2018, the United Kingdom released its joint statement
with the United States, France and Germany, emphasizing
Russia’s involvement in the attack anew by contending that
two suspected participants in the attack were identified as
officials of the Main Intelligence Directorate of the General
Staff of the Armed Forces of the Russian Administration and
that the attack could have been approved by top Russian
government officials.

attacking from a distance or threatening another country that
has superior conventional forces.
In recent years, along with the threat of ballistic missiles,
analysts have pointed to the threat of cruise missiles as a
weapon which is comparatively easy for terrorists and other
non-state actors to acquire and which has the potential for
proliferation.[27] Because cruise missiles are cheaper to produce
compared to ballistic missiles and are easy to maintain and
train with, many countries either produce or modify cruise
missiles. At the same time, it is said that cruise missiles have
a higher degree of target accuracy and that they are difficult
to detect while in flight.[28] Moreover, because they are smaller
than ballistic missiles, cruise missiles can be concealed on a

22 According to OPCW, 600 tons of Category 1 extremely toxic chemical materials, including sarin and VX gas, were disposed of (August 19, 2014, Statement by the OPCW Director-General).
In January 2016, OPCW reported that destruction of all of the chemical weapons reported by the Syrian Government was completed.

23 See Part I, Chapter 3, Section 7 for ISIL.
24 In a report by the joint investigation mechanism (JIM) involving the UN and OPCW, it was determined that the Syrian Government used chlorine gas in Talmenes (April 2014), in Sarmin (March
2015), and in Qmenas (March 2015), and also used sarin in Khan Sheikhun (April 2017). The report also found that ISIL used mustard gas in Marea (August 2015) and in Umm Hawsh
(September 2016). The U.S. Director of National Intelligence’s “Worldwide Threat Assessment” of February 2016 referred to ISIL’s contribution to this incident, and assessed that non-state
actors are using chemicals in warfare in Syria.

25 The draft Security Council resolution to establish a UN independent investigative mechanism for identifying users of chemical weapons, proposed by the United States on April 10, 2018,
was vetoed by Russia.

26 See Part I, Chapter 3, Section 7 for general information about the Syria situation, including military actions taken by the United States, United Kingdom and France.
27 In the July 2006 conflict between Israel and Lebanon, it is believed that Hezbollah used a cruise missile to attack an Israeli naval vessel. Israel announced in March 2011 that it had
uncovered six anti-ship cruise missiles among other items on cargo ships subject to inspection.

if they carry WMDs in their warheads.[29]

**4** **Growing Concerns about Transfer and Proliferation of WMDs and Other Technologies**


respectively. As a result, a considerable number of countries
now possess ballistic missiles. In addition, Pakistan’s Ghauri
and Iran’s Shahab-3 missiles are said to be based on North
Korea’s Nodong missiles. Furthermore, North Korea is
alleged to have provided conventional arms and ballistic
missiles to the Houthis of Yemen, have sent ballistic missile
engineers to Syria, have transferred special tiles used for
chemical weapon production facilities to Syria, and have
continued military relations with Myanmar, including
ballistic missile system trade.[33]

North Korea has made rapid strides in the development of
its ballistic missiles with only a few test launches. It is believed
that an underlying factor of this fact was North Korea’s
imports of various materials and technologies from outside
of the country. It is also noted that North Korea transfers and
proliferates ballistic missile airframes and related technologies,
and that it promotes the further development of missiles using
funds procured by such transfer and proliferation.[34]
The international community’s uncompromising and
decisive stance against the transfer and proliferation of
WMDs and other technologies has put significant pressure
on countries engaged in related activities, leading some of
them to accept inspections by international organizations
or abandon their WMD and other programs altogether.[35]
Meanwhile, it is pointed out that, in recent years, states
in which proliferation is a concern have sustained their
proliferation activities by averting international monitoring,
through illicitly exporting WMDs and other technologies
overseas by falsifying documentation, diversifying
transport routes, and utilizing multiple front companies
and intermediaries. Additionally, intangible transfer of
technology has arisen as a cause for concern. Namely, those
states have obtained advanced technologies which could be
adapted for the development and manufacturing of WMDs
and other technologies via their nationals—researchers and


ship to secretly approach a target, and present a serious threat

**4** **Growing Concerns about Transfer and Proliferation of WMDs and Other Technologies**

Even weapons that were purchased or developed for selfdefense purposes could easily be exported or transferred once
domestic manufacturing becomes successful. For example,
certain states that do not heed political risks have transferred
WMDs and related technologies to other states that cannot
afford to invest resources in conventional forces and attempt
to offset this with WMDs. Some of these states that seek
WMDs do not hesitate to put their land and people at risk,
and furthermore, due to their weak governance, terrorist
organizations are active in their countries. Therefore, it is
conceivable that in general, the possibility of actual use of
WMDs would increase.
Moreover, since it is uncertain whether such states can
effectively manage the related technology and materials,
there is a concern that chemical or nuclear substances will
be transferred or smuggled out from these states with high
likelihood. For example, there is a danger that even terrorists
who do not possess related technologies would use a dirty
bomb[30] as a means of terrorist attack so long as they gain
access to radioactive materials. Nations across the world
share concerns regarding the acquisition and use of WMDs
by terrorists and other non-state actors.[31]

The proliferation of WMDs and other related technologies
has been noted in numerous instances. For example, in February
2004, it came to light that nuclear-related technologies, mainly
uranium enrichment technology, had been transferred to North
Korea, Iran, and Libya by Dr. A.Q. Khan and other scientists
in Pakistan. It has also been suggested that North Korea
supported Syria’s secret nuclear activities.[32]

Furthermore, there has been significant transfer and
proliferation of ballistic missiles that serve as the means
of delivery of WMDs. The former Soviet Union and other
countries exported Scud-Bs to many countries and regions,
including Iraq, North Korea, and Afghanistan. China and
North Korea also exported DF-3 (CSS-2) and Scud missiles,

weapons and cruise missiles to the United States and its allies.

30 Dirty bombs are intended to cause radioactive contamination by spreading radioactive materials.
31 Based on these concerns, the UN Security Council adopted Resolution 1540 in April 2004, which sets forth the decision that all UN member states would refrain from providing support to
non-state actors that attempt to develop, acquire, manufacture, possess, transport, transfer, or use WMDs and their means of delivery, as well as adopt and enforce laws that are
appropriate and effective for prohibiting these activities. The International Convention for the Suppression of Acts of Nuclear Terrorism also entered into force in July 2007.

North’s proliferation activities.” The IAEA report of May 2011 states that the destroyed building was very likely a nuclear reactor that Syria should have declared to the IAEA.

33 Reports released by the Panel of Experts of the UN Security Council Democratic People’s Republic of Korea (DPRK) Sanctions Committee in March 2018 and March 2019
34 In addition, concerning the proliferation of WMDs and ballistic missiles by North Korea, the “Worldwide Threat Assessment” of the U.S. Director of National Intelligence of January 2014
pointed out that “North Korea’s export of ballistic missiles and associated materials to several countries, including Iran and Syria, and its assistance to Syria’s construction of a nuclear
reactor, destroyed in 2007, illustrate the reach of its proliferation activities.” Moreover, the report titled “Military and Security Developments Involving the Democratic People’s Republic of
Korea,” which was submitted by the U.S. DoD to Congress in May 2018, pointed out that missile and other weapon sales have become a key foreign currency revenue source and that
North Korea uses various techniques to circumvent measures taken by each country on the basis of UN Security Council resolutions, including sending cargo through multiple front
companies and intermediaries.

35 Extensive behind-the-scenes negotiations began in March 2003 among Libya, the United States and the United Kingdom. In December 2003, Libya agreed to dismantle all of its WMDs and
to accept inspections by an international organization. Later, in August 2006, Libya ratified the IAEA Additional Protocol. Meanwhile, after the military campaign against Libya by a

**5** **Iran’s Nuclear Issues**


In addition, the EU terminated some of its sanctions, and
the sanctions imposed by previous UN Security Council
resolutions concerning the nuclear issues of Iran ended, in
accordance with UN Security Council Resolution 2231.
Subsequently, the IAEA has repeatedly confirmed that Iran
is complying with the agreement. However, in May 2018,
President Trump pointed out that with the current agreement,
Iran can still be on the verge of a nuclear breakout in a short
period of time even if Iran fully complies with the agreement,
and also the agreement fails to address Iran’s development of
ballistic missiles. He then announced that the United States
will withdraw from the agreement. In November 2018, the
Trump administration resumed all sanctions that had been
lifted under JCPOA[39] and emphasized its readiness to cut
a more comprehensive deal with Iran, urging Iran to sit
down on the negotiating table. Meanwhile, Iran opposed the
sanction resumption by the United States and announced in
May 2019 that it would not observe some of the obligations
under JCPOA, while denying an intention to withdraw from
JCPOA. In response, the United States made clear its intention
to impose new sanctions against Iran in fields such as steel and
aluminum. In the same month, in order to respond to threats
from Iran to the U.S. forces and interests, the United States
deployed an aircraft carrier strike group, a bomber task force,
and others to the U.S. Central Command, which raised tensions
between the two countries.[40] In this situation, the EU, the United
Kingdom, Germany and France urged Iran to avoid further
steps away from JCPOA, and to keep compliance with JCPOA.
Meanwhile, Prime Minister Abe visited Iran from June 12 to 14,
2019. He had meetings with President Rouhani and Supreme
Leader Khamenei, and encouraged them to ease tensions and
stabilize the situation. It is necessary to keep a close watch on
future developments regarding the Iran situation.

**5** **Iran’s Nuclear Issues**

The nuclear issues of Iran are a serious challenge to the
international non-proliferation regime. In 2002, it was revealed
that Iran, without notifying the IAEA, had been engaged
for a long time in uranium enrichment and other activities
potentially leading to the development of nuclear weapons.
Since 2003, Iran has continued with its uranium enrichment
activities despite resolutions adopted by the IAEA Board
and the UN Security Council urging Iran to stop its uranium
enrichment and other activities.
However, with Hassan Rouhani winning the presidential
election in Iran in June 2013, the discussions with the E3+3 (the
United Kingdom, France, Germany, the United States, China,
and Russia) were advanced, resulting in the announcement of
the Joint Plan of Action (JPOA) towards the comprehensive
resolution of nuclear issues in November 2013. The execution of
the first step measures of the JPOA commenced in January 2014.[37]

On April 2, 2015, consultations held in Lausanne,
Switzerland, resulted in an agreement regarding the key
parameters of the final agreement. On July 14, 2015, the final
agreement concerning the nuclear issues of Iran, the Joint
Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA), was announced
in Vienna. Following this, on July 20, 2015, UN Security
Council Resolution 2231 approving the JCPOA was adopted.
In the agreement, it was decided that Iran would reduce its
enriched uranium stockpile and number of centrifuges, ban
the production of weapons grade plutonium, and accept IAEA
inspections, among other measures, in exchange for ending
the sanctions of previous UN Security Council resolutions and
the U.S. and EU’s nuclear-related sanctions.[38]

On January 16, 2016, the IAEA released a report confirming
Iran’s completion of the necessary preparatory steps to start
the implementation of the JCPOA. Accordingly, the United
States suspended its nuclear-related sanctions against Iran.


**Chapter**


36 The February 2016 report of the Panel of Experts of the UN Security Council DPRK Sanctions Committee states that over the past 20 years since 1996, North Korea has dispatched more
than 30 engineers to the Centre for Space Science and Technology Education in Asia and the Pacific, which receives technical support from the UN Office for Outer Space Affairs. These
engineers participate in research programs concerning topics such as satellite communications, space science and atmospheric chemistry, and satellite navigation systems. The report
notes that such knowhow regarding space science and satellite systems contributes to improving North Korea’s ballistic missile technology.

37 First step measures include the limited relaxation of sanctions by the E3+3, provided that for six months, Iran: (1) retains half of its existing uranium enriched to approximately 20% as
oxide and dilutes the remaining half to less than 5%; (2) does not enrich uranium over 5%; (3) does not advance activities at uranium enrichment facilities and heavy water reactors; (4)
accepts enhanced monitoring by the IAEA.

38 The major nuclear-related restrictions on Iran in the JCPOA include the following: with regard to uranium enrichment, limiting the number of centrifuges for uranium enrichment to 5,060 or
less, keeping the level of uranium enrichment at up to 3.67%, and restricting Iran’s enriched uranium stockpile to 300 kg; and with regard to plutonium production, redesigning and
rebuilding the Arak heavy water reactor to not produce weapons grade plutonium, and shipping spent fuel out of Iran, and not engaging in reprocessing spent fuel including R&D and not
constructing reprocessing facilities. According to then U.S. Secretary of State Kerry, with this agreement Iran’s breakout time (the time it takes to manufacture nuclear fuel for a single
nuclear weapon) will be extended from 90 days or less before the JCPOA to a year or more. Furthermore, the JCPOA is an agreement pertaining to nuclear issues and does not suspend or
lift sanctions related to international terrorism, missiles, human rights, among other issues. In response, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu of Israel, in his address to the UN General
Assembly in October 2015, strongly criticized the Iranian nuclear agreement for making war more likely. In the United States, while the Republican Party that makes up the majority of
Congress had been opposed to the agreement, the motion of disapproval was not supported by two-thirds majority vote of both the House of Representatives and the Senate necessary to
override the President’s veto. Thus, the disapproval of the agreement was avoided.

39 The sanctions include a ban on the Iranian government’s purchases of U.S. dollars, a prohibition on purchases of oil, petroleum products and petrochemical products from Iran, and a ban
on transactions with Iranian financial institutions, including the central bank. In May 2019, Significant Reduction Exceptions, which relate to a ban on some countries and regions’ purchase
of Iranian oil, etc., were also abolished.

40 In June 2019, commercial vessels, including one related to Japan, were attacked near the Straits of Hormuz. While the United States pointed out that Iran or its proxy was responsible for
the attacks, Iran denied it. In the same month, a U.S. drone was shot down by an Iranian surface-to-air missile over the Straits of Hormuz. The United States insisted that the drone was

In such situation, we Japanese must face up to the threat of
international terrorism as our own problem.

2 International Community Initiatives


It has become increasingly important that the international
community should examine the shape of tailored international
frameworks and involvement measures and seek out
appropriate responses to these complicated and diverse
destabilizing factors. Amid these situations, in recent years,
mandates of the UN Peacekeeping Operations (PKO)[2] have
come to include a wide range of areas, including not only
traditional roles like the monitoring of a ceasefire or military
withdrawal but also activities by civilians and police such
as the monitoring of disarmament, security sector reform,
the monitoring of elections and administrative activities,
and humanitarian assistance (e.g., return of refugees to their
homeland). This also suggests that the importance of the
roles related to the protection of civilians and peace-building
missions, in particular, has been growing.


1 Recent Trends


In a global security environment, there is a growing risk that
unrest or a security problem in a single country or region
could immediately develop into a destabilizing factor that
could affect the entire international community.
Conflicts or disputes concerning racial, religious,
territorial, resources and other issues are occurring or
continuing at various locations in the world. Particularly,
there are cases where power struggles accompanying regime
changes trigger or add fuel to racial, religious or partisan
disputes that are prolonged or escalated against the backdrop
of citizens’ discontent with economic or social disparities or
high unemployment rates. Human rights violations, refugees,
famine, poverty, or any other consequences of conflicts or
disputes can have impacts on not only parties to the conflicts
or disputes but also a wide range of other countries.
There are prominent cases where power vacuums in
some countries with political instability or weak governance
have become a hotbed for activities of international terrorist
organizations, such as Al Qaeda and ISIL. These organizations
are leveraging inadequate border control to obtain personnel,
weapons and money, and to send fighters to various locations to
carry out organized terrorist attacks or give some instructions
to local individuals or groups, expanding and stepping up
their operations across national borders. In recent years, they
have also been spreading their violent radical beliefs through
the Internet and other means across the world. As a result,
there were cases where young people in Western and other
developed countries felt sympathy for the violent radical
beliefs due to their social discontent, participating as fighters in
international terrorist groups and carrying out terrorist attacks
in their home countries. In this way, international terrorist
groups’ activities have remained a grave challenge for the
international community. There were incidents where Japanese
citizens were killed in Syria and Bangladesh, indicating that
Japanese citizens have become targets for terrorist attacks.[1]


**Chapter**


See Fig. I-3-7-1 (Peacekeeping Operations Currently Underway)

In addition to the UN PKO framework, multinational forces
and regional organizations authorized by the UN Security
Council have engaged in conflict prevention, peacekeeping,
and peacebuilding. In Africa, regional organizations such
as the African Union (AU)[3] undertake their activities based
on UN Security Council resolutions, and their activities are
sometimes handed over to UN PKO later. The international
community also offers recommendations and training
assistance and supplies equipment, from a long-term
perspective, prompting African nations self-help efforts to
enhance local government organizations and improve the
capabilities of their military and security organizations.
Concerning international counterterrorism measures,
international cooperation has grown even more important
as terrorism threats have diffused and deepened on the
diversification of terrorist attacks and the improvement of


In early 2015, ISIL murdered Japanese nationals in Syria, clearly declaring to subject Japanese nationals to terrorism. Furthermore, the seventh issue of the ISIL propaganda magazine
Dabiq published in February 2015 included descriptions of the murder of the Japanese nationals in Syria and renewed a call for terror attacks on Japanese nationals and interests. In
September of the same year, the 11th issue called for terror attacks on Japanese diplomatic missions in Bosnia, Malaysia, and Indonesia. The 12th issue (published in November 2015)
described the murder of a Japanese national in Bangladesh in October 2015 and warned again that Japanese nationals and Japanese interests would be the targets of terror attacks.

As of the end of March 2019, 14 UN PKO were operating globally, including about 88,480 military and police personnel and about 12,930 civilian personnel from 122 countries. Out of these
UN PKO, there were 10 operations in the Middle East and Africa (See Fig. I -3-7-1).

The AU is one of the world’s largest regional organizations, consisting of 55 countries and regions in Africa. The AU has established the Africa Standby Force (ASF) for peacekeeping
operations, developing an ASF brigade for each of Africa’s five component regions. In 2016, the AU declared the acquisition of complete ASF capabilities for the four regions excluding the

beliefs.[4]


In September 2014, the UN Security Council adopted Resolution 2178 on the issue of foreign terrorist fighters. The resolution requested member states to make exits from their countries
for the purpose of executing acts of terrorism punishable under domestic laws. The resolution also includes measures obligating member states to prevent entry or transit through their
territories of any individual about whom that state has credible information that demonstrates reasonable grounds for believing that the individual is attempting to enter or transit through
its territory for the purpose of participating in acts of terrorism. In addition, at the G7 Summit held in Germany in June 2015, the leaders reaffirmed their commitment to effectively
implement the established international framework for the freezing of terrorists’ assets. In June 2017, four major U.S. information technology companies including Facebook Corp. and

**(2) Progress in Military Operations against ISIL and the**
**Current Status of ISIL**

ISIL expanded its presence from 2013 in Iraq and Syria,
which had been destabilized through religious disputes and
civil war, and took control of northern and eastern Syria and
northern Iraq from January 2014. In response to the expansion
of ISIL’s reach, the Coalition forces led by the United States
have been conducting air strikes in Iraq and Syria since
August and September of the same year, respectively.[10] The
coalition forces have also engaged in education and training
of local forces, supply of weapons, and rescue of hostages by
the special forces.
In cooperation with such military operations, the Iraqi
Security Forces (including paramilitary troops and police
in addition to Iraqi government forces) and the Peshmerga
military organ of the Kurdistan Regional Government
(KRG) tried to recapture key cities from ISIL. As a result, the
Iraqi Government announced in December 2017 that all Iraqi
territory had been liberated from ISIL. In Syria, meanwhile,
the Syrian Democratic Forces, composed mainly of local
Kurd and Arab forces, recaptured Raqqa, the putative capital
of “Islamic State,” and other ISIL bases in the northern and
eastern parts of the country with support from the United
States and other countries. As the Syrian Democratic Forces
took control of ISIL’s last base in eastern Syria in March
2019, U.S. President Trump in his statement declared that
the United States and other Coalition countries had liberated
all ISIL-controlled territory in Syria and Iraq.
Russia launched its military operations in Syria in
September 2015 with the purpose of the survival of the
Assad administration and protection of Russian bases in
Syria.[11] In the military operations, the Russian forces carried
out air strikes and launched cruise missiles from the sea,
dropped precision satellite-guided bombs from strategic
bombers, and temporarily deployed an aircraft career to
conduct air strikes.[12] With this support from Russia, the
Assad administration conquered ISIL strongholds mainly


1 Trends in ISIL-related International Terrorist
Organizations


**(1) Organizational Objectives and Overview**

The objective of ISIL as an organization is to outright reject
the conventional system of national governance in the
region and claim the establishment of the caliphate based
on its own interpretation of Sharia law and the protection of
Sunni Muslims. In June 2014, ISIL unilaterally declared the
establishment of the “Islamic State” with its leader Abu Bakr
al-Baghdadi as “caliph,”[5] and effectively controlled certain
areas spanning Iraq and Syria through its well-developed
organizational structure and the issuance of its own currency.
ISIL has used social media and other means under a
sophisticated public relations strategy taking advantage of
cyberspace to skillfully issue propaganda for the organization
and recruit fighters. As a result, it has been noted that more
than 40,000 people, including foreign fighters, moved to
Iraq and Syria from other countries in response to ISIL
propaganda.
ISIL is believed to have seized weapons and ammunition
from Iraqi military and other facilities it occupied and obtained
others through illegal trafficking and looting. Furthermore,
it has been noted that ISIL has also begun producing and
modifying weapons. It has been pointed out that they are
manufacturing improvised explosive devices (IEDs) from
chemicals obtained through legal channels and using them
in suicide bombings.[6] It has also been pointed out that ISIL
has utilized drones. The terrorist organization has apparently
modified small commercial drones so that they can carry hand
grenades and the like.[7] ISIL has published videos claiming
that drones were used for dropping explosives on enemy
vehicles.[8] It has been noted that ISIL attempted to expand
damage by using camera-equipped drones to skillfully guide
suicide-attack vehicles.[9]


**Chapter**


5 The term means “successor” in Arabic. After Prophet Muhammad died, the term has been used to refer to those who led the Islamic community. Since then, a number of the heads of
hereditary dynasties, including the Umayyad and Abbasid dynasties, utilized this title.

6 It has been noted regarding the IEDs that ISIL used between July 2014 and February 2016 that parts and components manufactured and/or exported by approximately 50 firms in 20
countries fell into the hands of ISIL, who used them within a year after it acquired them.

7 In recent years, drone terrorist attacks (including attempted ones) have occurred. In November 2018, for example, the Kurdistan Workers’ Party (PKK) reportedly attempted drone attacks on
multiple government facilities in southeastern Turkey. Research and development on technologies to counter such threats are recognized as important for the future. To counter threats
from small UAVs, for example, radar systems capable of detecting and identifying small UAVs are under development. The U.S Army is testing laser and jamming systems to intercept small
UAVs.

8 It has been noted that the purpose is to destroy some vehicles and force them out of the frontlines through such attacks.

9 It has been noted that ISIL amplifies the effect of its attacks by using drones to find targets from the air and providing instructions to suicide bombers at the ready on the ground and
instructing optimal paths for them.

10 As of August 2017, the Coalition had conducted 13,331 and 11,235 air raids in Iraq and Syria respectively.
11 Tartus is the only Russian naval base facing the Mediterranean Sea in Syria, reportedly having a dockyard that can provide fuel and food to and repair military ships.
12 It is pointed out that the series of military actions by Russia was intended to display its military capabilities and to demonstrate those capabilities through operations. Some note that the

in southern and eastern Syria. In December 2017, Russia
declared that Syria’s entire territory had been liberated from
ISIL and announced that it would pull out some of its troops
deployed in Syria while maintaining its bases there.

While anti-ISIL military operations have made progress,
it is believed that thousands of ISIL fighters remain in hiding,
mainly around the Iraq-Syria border.[13] In this regard, terrorist
attacks believed to be conducted by ISIL are occurring in
various regions of Iraq and Syria, targeting security forces,
the Coalition forces,[14] citizens and others, indicating that
ISIL remains still active.

**(3) Dispersion beyond Iraq and Syria**

After ISIL declared the establishment of the “Islamic State,”
multiple “provinces” have been established outside of
Iraq and Syria as the “Islamic State” territories, and these
“provinces” have been conducting terrorist acts in various
regions.


See Fig. I-3-7-2 (Major Terrorist Groups Based in Africa and the
Middle East)

In Afghanistan, particularly, the Islamic State-Khorasan
Province has conducted frequent terrorist attacks in its capital
Kabul and elsewhere.[15] The Islamic State-Khorasan Province
claimed responsibility for a raid on a military parade in
southwestern Iran in September 2018 and a suicide bombing
attack on a market in northwestern Pakistan in November
2018. Terrorist attacks for which ISIL “provinces” have
claimed responsibility have also been confirmed in Yemen,
Egypt, Libya, Nigeria and elsewhere. It is believed that the
threat of terrorist acts by such organizations will continue in
the future.
Furthermore, organizations supporting ISIL exist in
Southeast Asia and have conducted terrorist attacks targeting
security forces and citizens. In the Philippines in May 2017,
organizations pleading allegiance to ISIL occupied part of
the city of Marawi on the island of Mindanao. In October of
the same year, the Philippine Government declared an end to


13 According to the Worldwide Threat Assessment announced by the U.S. Director of Intelligence in January 2019, ISIL still has thousands of fighters in Iran and Syria.
14 In Syria, for example, ISIL claimed responsibility for suicide bombing and other attacks in the southern province of Suwayda in July 2018, which killed 221 people. ISIL also claimed
responsibility for a vehicle bomb explosion in the northern Iraqi province of Nineveh in December 2018.

15 ISIL-Khorasan Province claimed responsibility for suicide bombings on House of Representatives election candidates’ campaign meetings and election committees in October 2018, as well

its fighting with them. However, the search for individuals
connected to the organizations has continued. ISIL claimed
responsibility for an attack on government forces in
November 2018 and a bombing on a church in January 2019
in the southern Philippines. As for Indonesia, ISIL claimed
responsibility for serial family suicide bombings in May
2018 in Surabaya, East Java Province. There is concern that
the threat posed by ISIL is permeating Southeast Asia as
well.[16]

Moreover, in April 2019, large-scale explosions occurred
simultaneously in Sri Lanka, a South Asian country,
claiming the life of a Japanese national. The Sri Lanka
authority exposed a local Islamic extremist organization
as the perpetrator while referring to possible support for
the organization from a foreign terrorist organization. The
United States points out that the terrorist attacks may have
been inspired by ISIL.

**(4) Foreign Fighters**

It is believed that the number of foreign fighters flowing
into Iraq and Syria in response to the rise of ISIL since 2014
has been falling, in line with a decline in ISIL’s strength.[17]

Meanwhile, it has been a concern that foreign fighters who
have accumulated combat training and experience would
return to their countries and conduct terrorist attacks there.
It is believed that at least 5,600 foreign fighters had returned
from Iraq and Syria to their home countries by October
2017.[18] Terrorist attacks in which ISIL fighters with fighting
experience in Syria have allegedly engaged have taken
place in Europe, including simultaneous attacks in Paris in
November 2015 and serial bombings in Belgium in March

2016.[19] The international community is required to continue
to take various initiatives going forward in order to prevent
such terrorist acts by foreign fighters.


that it continues its activities as a core organization such as
issuing instructions and recommendations to its affiliates in
North Africa and the Middle East. In addition, its current
leader Zawahiri has repeatedly issued statements calling for
terrorist acts against the West.[20] The possibility of Al Qaeda
attacks has not disappeared.

**(2) Al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula (AQAP)**

Al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula (AQAP), a Sunni
extremist organization based in Yemen, is active mainly
in south Yemen, continuing their fight against the Yemeni
security forces and the opposition insurgent group Houthis.
The United States has continued air strikes using UAVs[21]
and killed many AQAP leaders. However, AQAP has taken
advantage of the instability in Yemen to maintain a certain
level of force there. It also spreads violent extreme ideology
utilizing propaganda videos and magazines.


**Chapter**


**(3) Al Qaeda in the Islamic Maghreb (AQIM)**

Al Qaeda in the Islamic Maghreb (AQIM), a Sunni
extremist organization based in Algeria and also active in
Mali, Tunisia, and Libya has mainly conducted terrorist
attacks and kidnapping against Algerian security forces, and
European and U.S. nationals.[22] Although it is believed that
the frequency and scales of AQIM terrorist attacks have been
declining due to the French-led military intervention from
2013 and Algerian authorities’ enhanced crackdown, AQIM
affiliates have conducted terrorist attacks in countries such as
Mali, Burkina Faso, and Cote d’Ivoire.

**(4) Al-Shabaab**

“Al-Shabaab,” a Sunni extremist organization based
in Somalia, has continued terrorist acts against Somali
military forces and police, mainly in the Somalian capital
of Mogadishu, as well as the African Union Mission in
Somalia (AMISOM), the peacekeeping forces stationed for
the purpose of stabilizing the situation in Somalia after the
civil war. As indicated by an attack on a hotel in neighboring
Kenya’s capital of Nairobi in January 2019,[23] Al-Shabaab has
conducted terrorist acts against foreigners and other targets,
posing threats not only to Somalia but also to its neighboring

Organizations


**(1) Al Qaeda**

previous leader Osama Bin Laden as well as many executives

16 It is believed that Indonesians and Malaysians as well as Filipinos participated in an organization supporting ISIL in the fighting in the city of Marawi.
17 In an October 2017 press conference, the spokesperson for the Coalition expressed the understanding that there were virtually no foreign fighters flowing into Iraq and Syria at the time.
18 According to the Soufan Center, the numbers of foreign fighters returning to their home countries are approximately 800 in Tunisia, 760 in Saudi Arabia, 425 in the United Kingdom,
approximately 300 in Germany, 271 in France, and so on.

19 It is pointed out that participants in terrorist attacks in Paris in November 2015 included those who took advantage of refugee and immigrant flows to enter Europe. It is also noted that
participants in serial terrorist attacks on an airport and a subway station in the Belgian capital of Brussels in March 2016 consulted about the attacks with an alleged commander in Syria.

20 On September 11, 2018, it published a statement calling on Muslims to attack the United States as 17 years passed since Al Qaeda’s attacks on the United States on the same day of 2001.
21 The U.S. Central Command announced that it conducted 10 air strikes on AQAP and ISIL targets in Yemen in January 2018 and 26 air strikes on AQAP targets between February and
September.

22 The January 2013 terrorist attack in Algeria resulting in victims of Japanese nationality is believed to have been executed by the “Masked Brigade,” which had broken away from AQIM. In
2015, the Brigade merged with other organizations to form “Al-Murabitoun” and returned to the AQIM fold. Furthermore, in 2017, the Brigade merged with yet other organizations to form
Jama Nusrat al-Islam wal-Muslimin (JNIM; literally, protector of Islam and Muslims).

mainly in northeastern Nigeria,[26] which continues to be a
matter of security concern in Nigeria.

4 The Threat of “Home-grown” Terrorism


Terrorist organizations such as ISIL and Al Qaeda have been
using propaganda magazines and other means to introduce
specific methods for terrorist acts to their supporters, urging
them to conduct terrorist acts. For example, ISIL gives
detailed examples of specific methods and targets for terrorist
acts using knives and vehicles in its magazine Rumiyah and
others. Al Qaeda also has used its magazine to publish how
to make a bomb using materials close at hand.
In such situation, what is called “home-grown” terrorism,
in which residents are inspired by violent extremism spread
by terrorist organizations to conduct terrorist attacks at home,
continues to be a threat. In recent years, particularly, “lonewolf” terrorist attacks, planned and committed by individuals
or groups who have no official relations with international
terrorist organizations but have become influenced by them
in some ways, have occurred in Western and other countries.
“Lone-wolf” terrorist attacks characteristically use knives,
vehicles and guns that are easy even for individuals to
acquire, as indicated by an attack in the Australian city of
Melbourne in November 2018 and a raid on a Christmas
market in France in December 2018.[27] These attacks are also
difficult to anticipate or forestall.


countries.

3 Trends of Other International Terrorist Organizations


**(1) Taliban**

The Taliban, a Sunni extremist organization based in
Afghanistan, substantially reduced its strength temporarily
due to mop-up operations launched by the United States in
2001. After the U.S.-led International Security Assistance
Force (ISAF) ended its mission in Afghanistan and withdrew
from that country in December 2014, however, the Taliban
has been stepping up its offensive again and expanding its
control within Afghanistan.[24] Even during talks with the
United States since July 2018, the Taliban bombed and
raided Afghan military facilities in eastern Afghanistan in
January 2019,[25] indicating that the possibility of the Taliban
continuing suicide bombing and shooting attacks on the
Afghan Government and foreigners cannot be denied.


**Chapter**


**(2) Boko Haram**

Boko Haram is a Sunni extremist organization based in
Nigeria, pleading allegiance to ISIL, part of which is
conducting activities as the "ISIL’s West Africa Province."
Boko Haram might have lost most of the areas under
its control due to mop-up operations by Nigerian forces
cooperating with neighboring countries. However, it has
repeated terror attacks on citizens and government troops

**Current Situation of Regional Conflicts and the International Response (mainly in the Middle East**
**3**
**and Africa)**

1 Situation in Syria


Violent clashes in Syria since March 2011 pit four parties,
the Syrian government forces, opposition forces, Islamic
extremist forces, and Kurdish forces against each other.
However, government forces have gained the upper hand
overall with support from Russia, recapturing Aleppo, which
was once the largest stronghold of rebel forces, the suburbs
of the Syrian capital of Damascus and areas close to the
Syria-Jordan border.
In August 2018, Syrian government forces launched
shelling and other attacks on Idlib, a rebel stronghold even at
present, leading to concern that large-scale military attacks
there could be conducted. In September 2018, however,


Russia, which had been supporting Syrian government
forces, and Turkey, which had been backing up rebels, agreed
to establish a demilitarized zone around Idlib and withdraw
heavy artillery and rebels from the zone, averting large-scale
military attacks for the immediate future. However, extremist
rebels have yet to withdraw from the zone, while relevant
countries have continued talks to stabilize Idlib.
The peace talks have so far made little progress. The talks
have been conducted between the government and opposition
forces under UN auspices since January 2016. However,
fighting has failed to abate on either side, forcing the talks to
make a rough going. Under these circumstances, peace talks
led by Russia, Turkey, and Iran have continued in Astana,
Kazakhstan, since January 2017. In January 2018, the Syrian
National Dialogue Congress was held in Sochi, Russia,


24 The Taliban has been expanding its control, mainly in the northern and southern parts of Afghanistan, conducting terrorist attacks throughout the country.
25 While the United States held talks with the Taliban between January 21 and 26, 2019, the Taliban attacked a military base in central Afghanistan on January 21, killing more than 100
people.

26 Attacks came on a military base and citizens in northeastern Nigeria in November 2018. An attack on citizens in a town of the region in February 2019 killed more than 60 people.
27 In one of the recent “lone-wolf” terrorist attacks, a vehicle hit pedestrians in front of the Houses of Parliament Building in London in August 2018. In November 2018, a knife attack

agreeing to establish a constitutional committee towards the
enactment of a new constitution. In December 2018, Russia,
Iran and Turkey agreed to hold the first meeting of the
committee as early as possible in 2019. However, as there are
some points regarding which no agreement has been reached
among relevant parties, including the selection of committee
members, no schedule has been set for the meeting.
Furthermore, disputes between relevant forces over
the status of Kurds in Syria have been emerging. Kurds
expanded their control mainly in northern Syria through
anti-ISIL operations. In reaction, Turkey, which sees Kurds’
Democratic Union Party (PYD) as a terrorist organization,
carried out military operations in northwestern Syria to block
Kurds’ expansion, stationing Turkish forces in the area and
indicating the possibility of expanding military operations
to Kurd-controlled areas in northeastern Syria. In response,
the United States, which supported Kurds in anti-ISIL
operations, agreed with Turkey in June 2018 to withdraw
Kurds from Manbiji in northern Syria and implement joint
patrol there. They launched the joint control in November
2018. In December 2018, however, Turkish President
Erdogan claimed that Kurds had not withdrawn from
Manbij, announcing his intent to launch military operations
in northeastern Syria within a few days. In response, the
United States has continued talks with Turkey. While Turkey
has not launched military operations, the different stances on
Kurds between the two countries remain unresolved. In such
situation, Syrian government forces expanded into suburban
Manbiji at the request of Kurds, indicating cooperation
between Kurds and the Syrian government in countering
Turkish military operations.
Moreover, concerning Iranian presence in Syria,
confrontation between Iran and Israel has come to the
surface. In January 2019, Israeli Prime Minister Netanyahu
announced an attack on a weapon storage facility at Syria’s
Damascus Airport, expressing his determination to take
resolute actions against Iranians in Syria. It is a concern that
the escalation of confrontation between Israel and Iran would
affect Syrian and regional stability.
Amid the still unstable situation in Syria, in December
2018, U.S. President Trump announced the withdrawal of
U.S. troops from the country, declaring that ISIL had been
toppled. As for potential implications of the withdrawal of


U.S. troops under the current circumstances, some pointed
out the possibility of ISIL’s resurgence, Iran’s expansion
of influence in Syria, and Turkey’s attacks on Kurds, about
which concerns were expressed inside and outside the United
States. In January 2019, ISIL conducted multiple terrorist
attacks in northern Syria, the victims of which included U.S.
military personnel. Under the circumstances, the situation
regarding the withdrawal of U.S. troops will continue to
attract attention.
As shown thus far, relations between various forces over
the Syrian situation have been complicated, with peace
talks being stalled. Further initiatives from the international
community towards the stabilization of Syria are required.

2 The Situation Surrounding Middle East Peace


Since the foundation of Israel in 1948, there have been four
wars between Israel and Arab countries. The 1993 Oslo
Agreement was signed between Israel and Palestine and a
peace process made temporary progress but has fallen short of
achieving peace.[28] In the Palestinian territories, the moderate
Fatah, which governs the West Bank of the Jordan River, and
the Islamic fundamentalist Hamas, which effectively controls
the Gaza district, are in conflict, splitting the area. Since
October 2017, the Fatah and Hamas have continued direct
negotiations on the transfer of the administrative control of
the Gaza Strip to the Fatah under Egyptian auspices, but the
talks have remained stalled.[29]

In such circumstances, the U.S. Trump administration
announced its recognition of Jerusalem as the capital of
Israel in December 2017 and moved the U.S. embassy from

Tel Aviv to Jerusalem in May 2018. In reaction, protests have
been repeated mainly in Gaza, with protesters killed and
injured through their clashes with Israeli forces. Tensions
have increased intermittently as Israel carried out air strikes
on Gaza to counter rocket attacks from Gaza. In addition,
in March 2019, the Trump administration recognized Israeli
sovereignty over the Golan Heights, drawing criticism from
various Middle Eastern countries. While the United States is
reportedly working out a new Middle East peace proposal,[30]
future developments regarding the Middle East peace
process, including the United States’ engagement, will attract
attention along with the fate of negotiations on the transfer of


**Chapter**


28 Between Israel and Palestine, a peace process through full-fledged negotiations started through the 1993 Oslo Agreement. In 2003, both Israel and Palestine accepted a roadmap for
realizing a peace initiative featuring the peaceful coexistence of two countries. However, its implementation has made little progress. Later, following rocket attacks on Israel from the Gaza
Strip, Israeli forces launched large-scale military actions from late 2008 to early 2009 that included airstrikes on the Gaza Strip and the mobilization of ground forces. In November 2012,
Israeli forces again conducted airstrikes on the Gaza Strip. By 2012, Israel thus conducted two major military operations against the Gaza Strip. In both cases, fighting ceased under
mediation by Egypt and others.

29 In September 2017, the Hamas announced its intent to accept the administrative control of the Gaza Strip by the Fatah. In October of the same year, direct negotiations were held through
the mediation of Egypt, in which the two parties agreed on the transfer of the administrative control by December 1 of the same year. However, their negotiations have been stalled over the
transfer of the security control of the Gaza Strip and other issues.

30 In September 2018, U.S. President Trump vowed to release a Middle East peace proposal within four months. In January 2019, however, U.S. Ambassador to Israel Friedman said that the

the administrative control of the Gaza Strip.

3 Situation in Yemen


In Yemen, following anti-government protests that occurred
from February 2011 and international pressure afterward,
the then President Ali Abdullah Saleh agreed to resign
in accordance with the Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC)
initiative. Through the election held in February 2012, the
then Vice President Abd-Rabbu Mansour Hadi was elected
new President.
Meanwhile, the confrontation intensified between the
government and the opposition insurgent group Houthis,
based in northern Yemen. As the Houthis invaded the Yemeni
capital of Sana and the southern Yemeni city of Aden to
which President Hadi evacuated, the president requested
support from Arab countries. In response, in March 2015,
coalition forces led by Saudi Arabia began air strikes against
the Houthis.
A series of peace talks mediated by the UN took place
between April and August of the same year, but no final
peace agreement was reached, with the talks suspended.
Peace talks in September 2018 were planned but failed to
be implemented with the Houthis refusing to participate.
In December 2018, however, peace talks were held in
Stockholm, the capital of Sweden, leading to the signing
of an agreement on a ceasefire in Hodeidah, which has the
biggest port in the country, and the exchange of prisoners.
In January 2019, the UN Security Council decided to send a
ceasefire monitoring group to Hodeidha.
Despite the progress in the peace talks, negotiations on
specific measures toward the ceasefire made a rough going,
with the terms of the agreement, including the ceasefire
in Hodeidah, failing to be implemented. Military clashes
between the legitimate government troops and the Houthis,
and air strikes by the coalition forces have continued. In
addition, attacks by the Houthis with drones and ballistic
missiles on Saudi Arabia have frequently occurred.[31] In
January 2019, for example, the Houthis conducted a drone
bombing attack on a Yemeni military parade in suburban
Aden. In May 2019, Saudi Arabia announced that a crude
oil pipeline located in the middle of the country had been
attacked by drones, and the Houthis claimed responsibility
for it. In the following month, the Houthis intermittently
conducted missile attacks on civilian airports in southwestern
Saudi Arabia.
Furthermore, Saudi Arabia and others have repeatedly

criticized Iran for providing ballistic missiles, drones and
other goods to the Houthis. Indications are that no plans have
been made for any nationwide ceasefire in Yemen or a final
peace agreement.


**Chapter**


4 Situation in Afghanistan


In Afghanistan, the Taliban intensified its offensive as the
NATO-led Resolute Support Mission (RSM) launched
education, training and advice for the Afghan National
Defense and Security Forces (ANDSF) in the wake of ISAF’s
withdrawal in December 2014. Meanwhile, the ANDSF faces
challenges regarding logistics, morale, air capabilities, and
troop-commander leadership, allowing the Taliban to expand
its control in Afghanistan. Furthermore, ISIL has established
“Khorasan Province” and sustained terrorist attacks mainly
in the capital city of Kabul and eastern Afghanistan since
2015. As a result, suicide bombing and other attacks in
which the Taliban or ISIL is believed to be involved have
occurred one after another across the country, leaving
Afghanistan in an unstable security situation. According to
a report released by the U.S. Special Inspector General for
Afghanistan Reconstruction (SIGAR) in October 2018, the
areas controlled or influenced by the Afghan Government
accounted for approximately 55.5% of Afghan territory, the
lowest since December 2015, when the survey started.
The first peace talks between the Afghan Government and
the Taliban were held in May 2015, but have been suspended
due to the subsequent change in the supreme Taliban
leadership. Since July 2018, the Taliban has continued talks
with senior U.S. officials. In January 2019, it was reported
that they broadly agreed to withdraw U.S. and other foreign
troops from Afghanistan and prevent Al Qaeda, ISIL and
other terrorist organizations from using Afghan territory for


31 Since June 2015 when the Houthis and military forces supporting former President Saleh fired a Scud missile at Khamis Mushait in southern Saudi Arabia, ballistic missile attacks have
reportedly been repeated on the region. While the Houthis reportedly fired ballistic missiles at the Saudi capital of Riyadh from November 2017, Saudi Arabia claimed that it intercepted

other terrorist attacks in such cities as Tripoli, the capital,[32]
indicating that terrorist attacks may continue in the future.

6 Situation in Egypt


In Egypt, where then President Mubarak, who had been serving
as the president for approximately three decades, resigned
in 2011, and then President Mursi, who had been a member
of the Muslim Brotherhood,[33] was inaugurated. However, in
June 2013, large-scale protests of the people occurred amidst
the poor economic situation and the deterioration of security.
The military intervened in response and dismissed the
president. In May 2014, then Defense Minister Abdel-Fattah
el-Sisi was inaugurated as president. Since its inauguration,
the el-Sisi administration has undertaken economic reforms
including a shift to a floating exchange rate system and
the abolition of subsidies. However, enhancing domestic
security measures is still a major challenge. In particular,
the country’s mainland was subject to sporadic large-scale
terrorist attacks from 2013, when political turmoil took place,
to 2017, and in November 2018, a terrorist attack occurred
in the central part of the country, targeting Egypt’s minority
Coptic Christians.[34] Moreover, in the Sinai Peninsula,
terrorist attacks on military and police forces have occurred
sporadically mainly in the northern part, while the southern
part is overall peaceful. Since February 2018, Sinai 2018,
a counter-terrorism operation conducted by the Egyptian
Armed Forces, has been underway in the northern part of the
Sinai Peninsula.


their strongholds. However, challenges remain, including
different views between the United States and the Taliban
on a timetable for the withdrawal. Future talks between the
United States and the Taliban will attract attention along with
moves towards the resumption of peace talks between the
Afghan Government and the Taliban.

5 Situation in Libya


In Libya, following the collapse of the Gaddafi regime in
2011, elections for a General National Congress were
held in July 2012, establishing a congress consisting
mainly of Islamists. In June 2014, elections for a Council
of Representatives were held to establish a new congress
to replace the General National Congress. However, since
secularists became the majority, the confrontation between
Islamic and secular groups intensified, and consequently,
Libya became fragmented between east and west with two
assemblies existing in parallel – the Islamic groups’ General
National Congress based in the capital city of Tripoli and the
secular groups’ Council of Representatives based in Tobruk in
eastern Libya. In December 2015, the UN mediated a political
agreement for Libya and a national consensus government
was established in March 2016. However, as Islamic
groups took control of the new government, secular groups
turned their back and refused to join the national consensus
government. As a result, Libya remains divided between the
east and the west. Furthermore, militias supporting either the
east or the west have continued sporadic military clashes. In
September 2018, militias active in the west clashed, leading
to an emergency declaration. In April 2019, Commander
Hafter’s troops, the largest forces in eastern Libya, marched
into a suburb of the capital city of Tripoli and clashed with
militias subordinate to the unified national government in
western Libya, leading to an exchange of air strikes. Under
these circumstances, there are no prospects for establishing
domestic governance or security.
Furthermore, ISIL, Al Qaeda, and other terrorist
organizations are taking advantage of the unstable situation to
expand into Libya, clashing with militias across the country.
In particular, ISIL is believed to have been divided into
small groups and in hiding, conducting suicide bombing and

7 Situation in South Sudan


**(1) Political Turmoil**

The North-South civil war in Sudan, which had continued
since 1983, came to an end in 2005 with the entry into
force of the Comprehensive Peace Agreement (CPA). In
July 2011, the Republic of South Sudan was separated and
gained independence from the Republic of the Sudan. At the
same time, the UN Mission in the Republic of South Sudan
(UNMISS) was established.[35]

After the independence, a political confrontation emerged
between a mainstream faction led by President Salva Kiir


32 For example, ISIL claimed responsibility for a suicide bombing attack on the Foreign Ministry in the Libyan capital of Tripoli in December 2018, which killed at least three people.
33 A Sunni political organization established in Egypt in 1928 as a public organization seeking to “revive Islam.” In the 1950s, it became a target of a clampdown for plotting the assassination
of President Gamal Abdel Nasser. However, by the 1970s, the organization became moderate to the extent of conducting political activities through parliament. Meanwhile, extremist
organizations were derived, with Muslim Brotherhood serving as the parent organization.

34 ISIL claimed responsibility for a shooting attack on buses on their way to a Coptic Christian monastery in central Egypt, which killed seven people.
35 The UNMISS mandate had initially covered peacebuilding, nation-building and enhancing national functions. In 2014, however, the mandate was changed to cover protecting civilians and
fostering an environment for human rights protection and humanitarian aid. In December 2015, support for the implementation of the conflict resolution agreement was added to the
mandate, and the March 2019 resolution includes the Revitalized Agreement on the Resolution of the Conflict and support for implementing the peace process. As of April of the same year,

Mayardit, a Dinka, and a nonmainstream faction including
Vice President Riek Machar, a Nuer.[36] In July 2013, President
Kiir dismissed Vice President Machar and all other cabinet
ministers. In December 2013, clashes that broke out between
the government and the pro-Machar faction in the capital
city of Juba and violent acts targeting specific ethnic groups
spread to different areas of the country in a short span of
time, resulting in a large number of casualties, refugees, and
internally displaced persons (IDPs).
The “Intergovernmental Authority on Development”
(IGAD)[37] assisted by the UN and the AU initiated efforts to
start dialogues among South Sudanese leaders and enable
their reconciliation. In January 2014, the government and the
pro-Machar faction signed an agreement on ceasing hostile
activities.
In August 2015, the government, the pro-Machar faction
and others reached the Agreement on the Resolution of the
Conflict in the Republic of South Sudan (ARCSS), the key
elements of which include the establishment of a transitional
government. In April 2016, the Transitional Government of
National Unity was established, in which Mr. Kiir serves as
president and Mr. Machar as first vice president.
In July 2016, a shooting occurred in Juba between the
security forces of President Kiir and First Vice President
Machar. After First Vice President Machar fled the country,
and President Kiir dismissed First Vice President Machar,
clashes started to occur again between the government and
the Machar faction.
In response to the situation, in August 2016, the UN
Security Council created the Regional Protection Force
(RPF)[38] for the purpose of maintaining security in Juba

and surrounding areas. The RPF launched its operations in
April 2017. In December 2017 and February and May 2018,
the High-Level Revitalization Forum[39] was held under the
leadership of IGAD, where the government agreed with the
pro-Machar faction and others on the cessation of hostilities.
As a result of the efforts, in June 2018, President Kiir,
former First Vice President Machar and others signed the
“Khartoum Declaration of Agreement on South Sudan,”
which includes a permanent ceasefire. They agreed on
security arrangements in July 2018 and on provisional
government arrangements in August, before signing the


Revitalized Agreement on the Resolution of the Conflict
in South Sudan” in September. Although a new provisional
government was to be established by May 2019, the
government and representatives of the pro-Machar faction
agreed on the extension of the pre-transitional period by six
months.

8 Situation in Somalia


Somalia plunged into anarchy on the collapse of its
government in 1991,[40] facing a serious humanitarian crisis
with massive refugees generated. In 2005, the Transitional
Federal Government (TFG) was inaugurated through the
intermediation of the neighboring countries. In 2012, a
unified government was established for the first time in 21
years.
Even after the establishment of the unified government,
Somalia has faced two major issues—terrorism and piracy. AlShabaab, a Sunni extremist organization based in the central
south, has repeatedly conducted terrorist attacks against the
government and other targets. In 2007, the AMISOM[41] was
established with the approval of the UN Security Council.
As a result of attacks by the AMISOM forces and the Somali
government forces under reconstruction with support from
Western countries, Al-Shabaab lost its control on major cities
and weakened to some extent. However, its threat has still
existed. Al-Shabaab frequently stages attacks against the
bases of the Somali and AMISOM forces and terrorist attacks
within Somalia and in AMISOM member countries.[42] It has

been pointed out that ISIL fighters have been flowing into
Somalia in recent years. Since March 2017, counterterrorism
operations by U.S. forces have intensified.
In Somalia, especially in its northeastern part, there are
believed to be outposts of pirates who are active off the
coast of Somalia and in the Gulf of Aden. The international
community has continued anti-piracy operations and
implemented a series of initiatives to enhance the security
capabilities of Somalia based on the perception that
instability of Somalia has caused the piracy issue. As a result,
the number of reported pirate attacks has remained low.


**Chapter**


36 Hereinafter, the anti-mainstream faction and anti-government forces formed around Machar is referred to as the pro-Machar faction.
37 IGAD was established in 1996. Its members are the eight East African nations of Djibouti, Ethiopia, Kenya, Somalia, Sudan, Uganda, Eritrea, and South Sudan.
38 The RPF is authorized to use all necessary means to achieve the following three mandates: (1) facilitation of conditions for safe and free movement in Juba and its vicinity; (2) protection of
the airport and key facilities; (3) engagement in any actor that is credibly found to be preparing attacks, or engagement in an attack against UN protection-of-civilians sites or civilians, etc.

39 It was held in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia, bringing together the various factions in South Sudan, to revitalize the 2015 Agreement on The Resolution of The Conflict.
40 In 1991, “Somaliland” located in the Northwest declared its independence. In 1998, “Puntland” located in the Northeast declared the establishment of an autonomous government.
41 Uganda, Burundi, Djibouti, Kenya, and Ethiopia supply most of the troops. Security Council Resolution 2372 (August 2017) determined that the troops would be reduced from 22,126
members to 21,626 by December 31, 2017 and further reduced to 20,626 by October 31, 2018.

42 In October 2017, a terrorist attack using a vehicle borne improvised explosive device (VBIED) occurred in Mogadishu, killing more than 500 people. In January 2019, a terrorist attack came

**1** **Measures to Ensure Japan’s Security**


The independent state of a nation must
be protected in order for it to determine
its own direction in politics, economy,
and society, as well as maintaining its
culture, tradition, and sense of values.
In addition, peace and security are
essential for the people to live with a
sense of safety and for Japan to continue
to prosper. However, peace, safety, and
independence cannot be secured by
simply wishing for them. The essence
of national security can be found in
creating an international environment
that is stable and predictable, while
preventing the emergence of threats
before they occur, through diplomacy. Prime Minister Abe inspecting the troop review (October 2018) [courtesy of the Cabinet Secretariat

invasions, and they cannot be replaced by any other means.
For this reason, Japan is striving to develop appropriate
defense capabilities to protect the life and properties of its
nationals and to defend the territorial land, sea, and airspace
of Japan. At the same time, it is strengthening the Japan–
U.S. Alliance[1] with the United States, which shares basic
values and interests with Japan. This underlines that the
peace and security of Japan is ensured through developing
seamless defense measures by coupling Japan’s own defense
capabilities with the Japan-U.S. Security Arrangements.

**2** **Constitution and the Basis of Defense Policy**


**1** **Constitution and the Right of Self-Defense**


Since the end of World War II, Japan made a decision not
to repeat the ravages of war and has worked hard to build
a peace-loving nation. The Japanese people desire lasting
peace, and the principle of pacifism is enshrined in the
Constitution, Article 9 of which prescribes the renunciation
of war, the prohibition of war potential, and the denial of the
right of belligerency of the state. Of course, since Japan is
an independent nation, these provisions do not deny Japan’s

**2** **The Government’s View on Article 9 of the Constitution**

1 Permitted Self-Defense Capability


Under the Constitution, Japan is permitted to possess the
required minimum self-defense capability. The specific limit
is subject to change according to the prevailing international
situation, the level of military technologies, and various other
factors, and it is discussed and decided through annual budget
and other deliberations by the Diet on behalf of the people.
Whether such capability constitutes a “war potential” that is
prohibited by Article 9, Paragraph 2 of the Constitution must
be considered within the context of Japan’s overall military
strength. Therefore, whether the SDF should be allowed
to possess certain armaments depends on whether such
possession would cause its total military strength to exceed
the constitutional limit.
The possession of armaments deemed to be offensive
weapons designed to be used only for the mass destruction
of another country is not permissible under any circumstance
as it would, by definition, exceed the minimum necessary
level. For example, the SDF is not allowed to possess
intercontinental ballistic missiles (ICBM), long-range
strategic bombers, or attack aircraft carriers.


inherent right of self-defense as a sovereign state. Thus, the
Japanese Government interprets this as a constitutional right
to possess the minimum armed forces needed to exercise that
right. Therefore, Japan, under the Constitution, maintains
the Self-Defense Forces (SDF) as an armed organization,
holding its exclusively defense-oriented policy as its basic
strategy of defense, and continues to keep it equipped and
ready for operations.

there are no appropriate means to deal with such aggression
other than by resorting to the right of self-defense; and (3)
When the use of armed force is confined to be the minimum
necessary level. However, it has been concluded in the
Cabinet’s decision made on July 1, 2014, “Development of
Seamless Security Legislation to Ensure Japan’s Survival
and Protect its People,”[1] that “the use of force” should
be interpreted to be permitted under the Constitution as
measures for self-defense when the following “Three New
Conditions” are met: (1) When an armed attack against Japan
has occurred, or when an armed attack against a foreign
country that is in a close relationship with Japan occurs and
as a result threatens Japan’s survival and poses a clear danger
to fundamentally overturn people’s right to life, liberty and
pursuit of happiness; (2) When there is no appropriate means
available to repel the attack and ensure Japan’s survival and
protect its people; (3) Use of force to the minimum extent
necessary. The following is the interpretation of the measures
for self-defense permitted under Article 9 of the Constitution
defined in the abovementioned Cabinet decision.
The language of Article 9 of the Constitution appears
to prohibit “use of force” in international relations in all
forms. However, when considered in light of “the right (of
the people) to live in peace” as recognized in the Preamble
of the Constitution and the purpose of Article 13 of the
Constitution which stipulates, “their (all the people’s) right
to life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness” shall be the
supreme consideration in governmental affairs, Article 9 of
the Constitution cannot possibly be interpreted to prohibit
Japan from taking measures of self-defense necessary to
maintain its peace and security and to ensure its survival.


**Chapter**


2 Measures for Self-Defense Permitted under Article 9 of
the Constitution


In the past, the Government had interpreted Article 9 of
the Constitution to mean that armed force could be used to
exercise the right of self-defense only when the following
three conditions were met: (1) When there is an imminent
and illegitimate act of aggression against Japan; (2) When

1 S Ch t 5 S ti 1 1


-----

Such measures for self-defense are permitted only when they
are inevitable for dealing with imminent unlawful situations
where the people’s right to life, liberty, and the pursuit of
happiness is fundamentally overturned due to an armed
attack by a foreign country, and for safeguarding these rights
of the people. Hence, “use of force” to the minimum extent
necessary to that end is permitted. This is the basis, or the
so-called basic logic, of the view consistently expressed
by the government to date with regard to “use of force”
exceptionally permitted under Article 9 of the Constitution,
and clearly shown in the document “Relationship between
the Right of Collective Self-Defense and the Constitution”
submitted by the Government to the Committee on Audit of
the House of Councillors on October 14, 1972.
This basic logic must be maintained under Article 9 of the
Constitution.
To date, the Government has considered that “use of
force” under this basic logic is permitted only when an
“armed attack” against Japan occurs. However, in light of
the situation in which the security environment surrounding
Japan has been fundamentally transformed and continuously
evolving by shifts in the global power balance, the rapid
progress of technological innovation, and threats such as
weapons of mass destruction, etc., in the future, even an
armed attack occurring against a foreign country could
actually threaten Japan’s survival, depending on its purpose,
scale and manner, etc.
Japan, as a matter of course, will make the utmost
diplomatic efforts, should a dispute occur, for its peaceful
settlement and take all necessary responses in accordance
with the existing domestic laws and regulations developed
based upon the constitutional interpretation to date. It is still
required, however, to make all necessary preparations in
order to ensure Japan’s survival and protect its people.
Under such recognition and as a result of careful
examination in light of the current security environment,
it has been concluded that not only when an armed attack
against Japan occurs but also when an armed attack against
a foreign country that is in a close relationship with Japan
occurs and as a result threatens Japan’s survival and poses
a clear danger to fundamentally overturn people’s right to
life, liberty and pursuit of happiness, and when there is no
other appropriate means available to repel the attack and
ensure Japan’s survival and protect its people, use of force
to the minimum extent necessary should be interpreted to be
permitted under the Constitution as measures for self-defense
in accordance with the basic logic of the Government’s view
to date.
As a matter of course, Japan’s “use of force” must be
carried out while observing international law. At the same


time, a legal basis in international law and constitutional
interpretation need to be understood separately. In certain
situations, the aforementioned “use of force” permitted under
the Constitution is, under international law, based on the
right of collective self-defense. The Government has reached
a conclusion that although this “use of force” includes those
which are triggered by an armed attack occurring against a
foreign country, they are permitted under the Constitution,
only when they are taken as measures for self-defense which
are inevitable for ensuring Japan’s survival and protecting its
people, in other words, for defending Japan.

3 Geographic Boundaries within which the Right of
Self-Defense May Be Exercised


The use of the minimum necessary force to defend Japan
under the right of self-defense is not necessarily confined to
the geographic boundaries of Japanese territory, territorial
waters, and airspace. However, it is difficult to give a general
definition of the actual extent to which it may be used, as this
would vary with the situation.
Nevertheless, the Government interprets that, as a
general rule, the Constitution does not permit armed
troops to be dispatched to the land, sea, or airspace
of other countries with the aim of using force; such
overseas deployment of troops would exceed the
definition of the minimum necessary level of self-defense.


**Chapter**


4 Right of Belligerency


Article 9, Paragraph 2 of the Constitution prescribes that “the
right of belligerency of the state will not be recognized.”
However, the “right of belligerency” does not mean the right
to engage in battle; rather, it is a general term for various
rights that a belligerent nation has under international law,
including the authority to inflict casualties and damage upon
the enemy’s military force and to occupy enemy territory.
On the other hand, Japan may of course use the minimum
level of force necessary to defend itself. For example, if
Japan inflicts casualties and damage upon the enemy’s
military force in exercising its right of self-defense, this is
conceptually distinguished from the exercise of the right of
belligerency, even though those actions do not appear to be
different. Occupation of enemy territory, however, would
exceed the minimum necessary level of self-defense and is
not permissible.


-----

**3** **Basic Policy**


Under the Constitution, Japan has efficiently built a highly
effective and joint defense force in line with the basic
principles of maintaining an exclusively defense-oriented
policy and not becoming a military power that poses a threat
to other countries, while firmly maintaining the Japan-U.S.
Security Arrangements and adhering to the principle of
civilian control of the military, observing the Three NonNuclear Principles.

1 Exclusively Defense-Oriented Policy


The exclusively defense-oriented policy means that
defensive force is used only in the event of an attack, that the
extent of the use of defensive force is kept to the minimum
necessary for self-defense, and that the defense capabilities
to be possessed and maintained by Japan are limited to the
minimum necessary for self-defense. The policy including
these matters refers to the posture of a passive defense
strategy in accordance with the spirit of the Constitution.


4 Securing Civilian Control


Civilian control refers to the priority of politics to the
military in a democratic state or democratic political control
of military strength. Japan has, by giving serious reflection
to the regrettable state of affairs that happened until the
end of World War II, adopted the following strict civilian
control system that is entirely different from the one under
the former Constitution.[4] Civilian control aims to ensure that
the SDF is maintained and operated in accordance with the
will of the people.
The Diet, which represents Japanese nationals, makes
legislative and budgetary decisions on such matters as the
allotted number of the SDF personnel and main organizations
of the Ministry of Defense (MOD) /the SDF. It also issues
approval for defense operations of the SDF. The function
of national defense entirely falls under the executive power
of the Cabinet as a general administrative function. The
Constitution requires that the Prime Minister and other
Ministers of State who constitute the Cabinet be civilians.
The Prime Minister, on behalf of the whole Cabinet, holds
the authority of supreme command and supervision of the
SDF. The Minister of Defense, who is exclusively in charge
of national defense, exercises general control and supervises
over the SDF duties. In addition, the National Security
Council of Japan under the Cabinet deliberates important
matters on national security.

**Chapter**


2 Not Becoming a Military Power


There is no established definition for the concept of a military
power. For Japan, however, not becoming a military power
that could threaten other countries means that Japan will not
possess and maintain a military capability strong enough
to pose a threat to other countries, beyond the minimum
necessary for self-defense.

3 Non-Nuclear Principles


The Three Non-Nuclear Principles refers to those of not
possessing nuclear weapons, not producing them, and not
allowing them to be brought into Japan. Japan adheres to
the Three Non-Nuclear Principles as a fixed line of national
policy.
Japan is also prohibited from manufacturing and
possessing nuclear weapons under the Atomic Energy Basic
Law.[2] In addition, Japan ratified the Treaty on the NonProliferation of Nuclear Weapons (NPT), and as a nonnuclear weapons state, has an obligation not to manufacture
and acquire nuclear weapons.[3]


At the MOD, the Minister of Defense takes charge of
and manages the matters concerning national defense, and


Article 2 of the Atomic Energy Basic Law states that “The research, development and utilization of atomic energy shall be limited to peaceful purposes, aimed at ensuring safety and
performed independently under democratic management.”

Article 2 of the NPT states that “Each non-nuclear weapon State Party to the Treaty undertakes...not to manufacture or otherwise acquire nuclear weapons or other nuclear explosive
devices...”

**3** **Outline of the National Security Strategy**

**1** **National Security Council**


As the security environment surrounding Japan grows
increasingly testing, Japan faces mounting security challenges
that it needs to address. Under such circumstances, it is
necessary to carry forward the policies pertaining to national
security from a strategic perspective under strong political
leadership with the Prime Minister at its core. For this
reason, the National Security Council was established in the
Cabinet in December 2013 to provide a platform to discuss
important matters with regard to Japan’s security. Since its
establishment, the Council has met 194 times (as of the end
of June 2019) and has been serving as a control tower for
foreign and defense policies. The National Security Strategy
(NSS) and the National Defense Program Guidelines for
FY2019 and beyond (NDPG) are also deliberated and
approved in this National Security Council.
The National Security Secretariat established within the
Cabinet Secretariat provides constant support to the National
Security Council as its secretariat. The Secretariat is also
tasked with planning and designing, and overall coordination
of basic guidelines and important matters with regard to


personnel deliberates on basic principles concerning affairs
under the Ministry’s jurisdiction. Through these ways, the
MOD aims to further ensure civilian control.
As mentioned above, the civilian control system is well
established. However, in order to ensure that the system
achieves good results, it is necessary to continue making
practical efforts in both political and administrative aspects,
along with a deep interest in national defense taken by the
people.

foreign and defense policies pertaining to national security.
Administrative organs that are deeply involved in policies
support the Secretariat with both personnel and information.
The Secretariat has many civilians and uniformed personnel
of the MOD with concurrent posts, who are engaged in the
planning and designing of policies, as well as the utilization
of respective specialized knowledge. In addition, global
military trends and other information are shared in a timely
manner.
The enhanced ability to formulate national security
policies has led to the systematic alignment of Japan’s
national security, and to the provision of a direction for
policies with regard to new security challenges. Furthermore,
individual defense policies are formulated and efforts to
accelerate decision-making are made based on the basic
guidelines discussed at the National Security Council, and
this is contributing significantly to improved development
and implementation of policies within the MOD.

is drawn on the MTDP substantiated as projects, and the
necessary expenses for each fiscal year will be appropriated
based on relevant situations.
To date, the NDPG has contained mention of nationwide
basic security policies focusing on defense policy to a certain
extent. The NSS carries great meaning as the definitive
statement of the Government’s basic policy on national
security, with a focus on diplomatic affairs and defense
policy.


2 Outline of the National Security Strategy: Proactive
Contribution to Peace


Japan is committed to continuing the path it has followed
to date as a peace-loving nation and, as a major player in
international politics and business, it also seeks its own
security as well as peace and stability in the Asia-Pacific
region from the perspective of a Proactive Contribution
to Peace. Japan will contribute more proactively than
ever before to the peace, stability, and prosperity of the
international community.
In achieving the aforementioned fundamental principle of
national security, the NSS makes national interests and goals
clear, and demonstrates a strategic approach that needs to be
employed.

General of each Bureau within the Internal Bureaus, along
with the Commissioner of ATLA who is in charge of defense
equipment administration, support the Minister of Defense
in accordance with their respective responsibilities, by
providing assistance from a policy perspective – namely, to
ensure that the affairs under the jurisdiction of the MOD are
properly carried out in accordance with laws and regulations
in order to accomplish the duty of the MOD. The Joint Staff
is a staff organization for the Minister of Defense concerning
the operation of the SDF. The Chief of Joint Staff provides
centralized support for the operations of the SDF for the
Minister of Defense from a military expert’s perspective.
The Ground Staff, Maritime Staff and Air Staff are the staff
organizations for the Minister of Defense concerning their
respective services except operations of the SDF, with the
Chiefs of Staff for the Ground Self-Defense Force (GSDF),
the Maritime Self-Defense Force (MSDF) and the Air SelfDefense Force (ASDF) acting as the top ranking expert
advisers to the Minister of Defense regarding these services.
In this manner, the MOD has ensured that the support for the
Minister from a policy perspective and the support for the
Minister from a military expert’s perspective are provided in
a well-balanced manner like the two wheels of a cart, so to
speak, in order for the Minister of Defense to appropriately
make decisions. This existing concept regarding the support
system for the Minister of Defense has been made even more
explicit by Article 12 of the Ministry of Defense Establishment
Act, which has been amended to stipulate that the support for
the Minister of Defense provided by the Director-General
of the Minister’s Secretariat and the Directors-General of
each Bureau as well as the Commissioner of ATLA shall be
conducted in cooperation with the support for the Minister by
each Chief of Staff, since 2015, when the Act was amended

2 Systems to Support the Minister of Defense


The Minister of Defense takes charge of and manages the
matters related to the defense of Japan as the competent
minister, and is in overall charge of the SDF duties in
accordance with the provisions of the SDF Law. The
Minister is supported by the State Minister of Defense,
the Parliamentary Vice-Ministers of Defense (two) and
the Senior Adviser to the Minister of Defense. There are
also the Special Advisers to the Minister of Defense, who
advise the Minister of Defense, and the Defense Council,
which deliberates on basic principles concerning affairs
under the Ministry’s jurisdiction. Furthermore, there are the
Administrative Vice-Minister of Defense, who organizes
and supervises the administrative affairs of each bureau
and organization to support the Minister of Defense, and
the Vice-Minister of Defense for International Affairs, who
is responsible for the overall coordination of duties such as
those related to international affairs.
Moreover, the Internal Bureaus of the MOD, Joint
Staff, Ground Staff Offi ce, Maritime Staff Offi ce, Air Staff
Offi ce, and the Acquisition, Technology & Logistics Agency
(ATLA), as an external bureau, have been established in the
MOD. The Internal Bureaus of the MOD are responsible for

The MOD and the SDF form a single organization. Whereas the term “Ministry of Defense” refers to the administrative aspects of the organization, which manages and operates the GSDF,
MSDF, and ASDF, the term “SDF” refers to the operational aspects of the organizations whose mission is the defense of Japan.

The Government has made replies regarding civilian control and the role of the civilian offi cials in the Internal Bureaus during the Diet deliberations on the Amendment Act, stating: “Civilian
control means prioritizing politics over the military in democratic countries. Civilian control in our country consists of control by the Diet, control by the Cabinet (including the National
Security Council), and control within the MOD. Control within the MOD means that the Minister of Defense, a civilian, manages, operates, and controls the SDF. In addition to support from
political appointees, such as the State Minister of Defense and Parliamentary Vice-Ministers of Defense, support from civilian offi cials in the Internal Bureaus also plays an important role in
aiding the exercise of civilian control by the Minister of Defense. The role of civilian offi cials in the Internal Bureaus in civilian control is to support the Minister of Defense, and there is no

2 Strengthening Integrated Operational Functions


**(1) Past Initiatives**

In order to ensure the accuracy of decision-making relating
to the operations of the SDF and to make the process swifter,
in October 2015, the Bureau of Operational Policy was
abolished and some of its functions, such as the planning and
drafting of laws and regulations relating to unit operations,
were transferred to the Bureau of Defense Policy in order to
unite affairs concerning actual operations of the units into
the Joint Staff. This change has made the Joint Staff assume
work that the Internal Bureaus had previously conducted,
such as external explanations, including replies at the Diet,
and communication and coordination with related ministries
and governmental agencies. Regarding this work, therefore,


**(2) Future Initiatives**

In order to realize cross-domain operations, the Joint Staff’s
posture designed for efficient SDF operations and for new
domains will be strengthened, thereby enabling swift and
effective exercise of the SDF’s total capabilities. In addition,
the future framework for joint operations will be examined.

The MOD reform started in response to the frequent

and central organization reform. Based on the report, the
establishment of the Defense Council under law, the abolition
of the post of the Director of Defense and the establishment
of the Senior Adviser to the Minister of Defense (presently
the Special Adviser to the Minister of Defense) were
implemented on the basis of the report in order to strengthen
support for the Minister of Defense and to ensure civilian
control thoroughly in 2009. Following this, in the “Direction
of the MOD Reform” arranged at the “Committee for the
Deliberations on the MOD Reform,” established in the MOD
in 2013, it was determined that full-fledged reform based on
following four main points would be undertaken: (1) mutual
posting of civilian officials and uniformed personnel; (2)
total optimization of the building-up of defense capability
and the strengthening of equipment acquisition functions;
(3) strengthening of integrated operational functions, and (4)
strengthening of policymaking functions and public relations
capability.

2 Specific Initiatives on the Reform of the Ministry of
Defense


In accordance with the “Direction of the MOD Reform,”
the MOD has fostered a greater sense of unity by promoting
mutual posting of civilian officials and uniformed personnel.
In October 2015, in addition to the previously mentioned
reorganization at the Joint Staff, a large-scale reorganization
was implemented, which included the establishment of
the ATLA by bringing together and consolidating the
departments of the MOD that had been related to procurement
in order to accurately respond to the extending equipment
administration.
By conducting duties at these new organizations, the
MOD/SDF will ensure that this reform will be firmly
established, while assisting the Minister of Defense both
from a policy perspective of the Internal Bureaus and from a
military expert’s perspective of each Staff Office, with each
of them playing a role like the two wheels of a cart.

response to the series of issues concerning public records,
it was set down in the “Measures for Ensuring Appropriate

**New National Defense Program Guidelines**
### 3


The National Defense Program Guidelines (NDPG) is a
“grand design” to ensure the peace and security of Japan,
which establishes the posture of Japan’s defense capability
and the level to achieve based on the security environment
and the changes in military situation surrounding Japan.
The NDPG has squarely faced the reality of the security

**Section**
**1** **Features of the Past NDPGs**

**1** **1976 NDPG**


Formulated against the backdrop of the détente[2] of the 1970s,
the 1976 NDPG[3] was based on an awareness that (1) in
general, a full-scale military clash between East and West
would be unlikely to occur, and (2) in the vicinity of Japan,
the balanced relationship between the U.S., China, and the
Soviet Union, and the existence of the Japan-U.S. Security
Arrangements, would continue to play a substantial role in
preventing a serious invasion of Japan.
Taking that into consideration, with regard to Japan’s
defense capability, the 1976 NDPG stipulated that it
should (1) be furnished with the various functions required


environment at all times and set forth the defense capability
which is truly needed to protect the Japanese nationals.
Since it was fi rst formulated in 1976, the NDPG has been
established six times. The current NDPG for FY2019 and
beyond (2018 NDPG) was decided in 2018.[1]

for defense and (2) be in a balanced posture in terms of
organization and deployment, including logistic support,
(3) take an adequate surveillance posture in peacetime, (4)
effectively cope with a limited and small-scale invasion,
and (5) be capable of shifting smoothly to a new posture
regarding defense capability when required due to an
important change occurring in the situation. The concept
of Basic Defense Capability introduced by the 1976 NDPG
attached importance to deterrence, emphasizing measures to
prevent an invasion of Japan.


**Chapter**


**2** **1995 NDPG**


The 1995 NDPG[4] was formulated with consideration to the
change of the international security environment, such as
the end of the Cold War, and increasing public expectations
for the Self Defense Forces (SDF) in the wake of the United
Nations peacekeeping operations and response to the Great
Hanshin Awaji Earthquake.
The 1995 NDPG pointed out that previous defense buildup
policies were based on the concept of the Basic Defense
Force, which aimed to maintain a minimum-necessary
defense force as an independent nation preventing a power
vacuum that would destabilize the region, rather than coping
with a direct military threat to Japan, and basically followed


the same approach.
At the same time, in terms of the content of Japan’s defense
capability, the 1995 NDPG was characterized by its emphasis
on the further utilization of SDF capabilities not only in the
defense of Japan but also in response to large-scale disasters
and various other situations, and in contributions to a more
stable security environment, as well as reviewing the scale
and function of the defense force.

The situation where the tensions between the United States and the Soviet Union, which were in a confl ict referred to as “the Cold War” at the time, began to be eased, prompted by the
Cuban Missile Crisis in 1962. It ended with the Soviet Union’s intervention in Afghanistan in 1979.

**3** **2004 NDPG**


Amid the emergence of new threats and the challenges of
such diverse situations as the proliferation of weapons of
mass destruction and ballistic missiles, and the activities
of international terrorist organizations, the 2004 NDPG[5]
was formulated on the decision that new guidelines for the
approach to the national security and defense capability were
necessary.
The 2004 NDPG established two security goals: (1)
preventing direct threats from reaching Japan and, in the
event that one does, repel it and minimize any damage, and
(2) improving the international security environment, so as

**4** **2010 NDPG**


The 2010 NDPG[6] was formulated in light of the recognition
that (1) large-scale military capacity, including nuclear
capability, still exists in the surrounding region, with many
countries modernizing their military forces and intensifying
various activities; (2) dramatic progress in such fields as
military science and technology has shortened the time
between the first signs of a contingency and its development,
making a seamless response necessary; and (3) many security
issues extend across national borders, making partnerships
and cooperation between countries important from times of
peace, so the role of military forces is diversifying and it is
becoming common to continuously operate military forces,


to reduce the chances that any threat will reach Japan in the
first place. To this end, the 2004 NDPG set an integrated
combination of three approaches, (1) Japan’s own effort,
(2) Japan-U.S. Arrangements, and (3) Cooperation with
the international community. Accordingly, in terms of the
concept of defense capability, the 2004 NDPG stipulated
that a “multifunctional, flexible, effective defense force”
was necessary to address new threats and diverse situations,
with emphasis on response capabilities, while maintaining
effective aspects of the concept of Basic Defense Capability.

in peacetime.
Accordingly, the 2010 NDPG focused on SDF operations,
rather than the Basic Defense Force Concept, which
emphasized the existence of the defense force; as such, the
2010 NDPG stipulated that it was necessary to ensure that
future defense capability be dynamic and can proactively
conduct the various activities required to be fulfilled.
Therefore, the 2010 NDPG prescribed the development of a
Dynamic Defense Force that demonstrates readiness, mobility,
flexibility, sustainability, and versatility, underpinned by
advanced technical capabilities and intelligence skills, in
light of trends in the level of military technology.


**Chapter**


**5** **2013 NDPG**


The 2013 NDPG[7] was formulated in light of the fact that
the qualitative and quantitative capabilities of the defense
force underpinning the SDF activities were not necessarily
sufficient, even though the number and the duration of
situations, including so-called gray-zone situations, which
require the SDF’s commitment, were both increasing amid
the increasingly severe security environment surrounding
Japan.
The 2013 NDPG, being fully mindful of these needs,
called for the enhancement of deterrence and response
capability by pursuing further joint operations, improving
the mission-capable rate of equipment and its employment to
conduct activities, as well as developing defense capabilities
adequate in terms of both quality and quantity that underpin
various activities. To this end, Japan was to conduct capability
assessments based on joint operations in relation to the
SDF’s total functions and capabilities, in order to identify the


functions and capabilities that should be comprehensively
prioritized. The 2013 NDPG made it possible to adapt to an
ever-changing security environment surrounding Japan, and
realize a more prioritized and efficient defense capability
build-up, based on the results of these capability assessments.
Additionally, the 2013 NDPG required the build-up of the
most effective operational posture, by further strengthening
a wide-ranging logistics support foundation.
In this manner, the 2013 NDPG set forth that Japan
would develop a “Dynamic Joint Defense Force,” which
would provide an effective defense that enables the SDF to
conduct a diverse range of activities dynamically, adapting to
situations as they demand.

**Section**
**2** **Content of the National Defense Program Guidelines for FY2019 and Beyond (2018 NDPG)**


**1** **Background of Review of the 2013 NDPG**


Japan’s security environment is becoming more testing and
uncertain at a remarkably faster speed than expected when the
2013 NDPG was formulated. In light of such circumstances,
Prime Minister Shinzo Abe announced at his policy speech
to the 196th session of the Diet in January 2018 that the 2013
NDPG would be reviewed, while maintaining an exclusively
defense-oriented policy as given.
Based on this policy, related ministries and agencies, such
as the National Security Secretariat, the Ministry of Defense
(MOD), and the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, held repeated
discussions in close coordination. In addition, Prime Minister
Abe set up the Advisory Panel on Security and Defense
Capabilities in which experts from various specialized fields
conducted intense discussions. The Advisory Panel held
seven meetings from August to December of 2018.
In August of the same year, the MOD established the
Study Committee on Future Defense Capabilities, chaired
by the Minister of Defense, with an aim to set up a crossministerial study framework and conduct in-depth study. The
Committee met six times and held intensive study on matters
including the approach to strengthening defense capabilities
and the structure of the SDF.

**2** **Basic Approach—Building a Multi-Domain Defense Force**


So far, Japan has built a “Dynamic Joint Defense Force”
which enables the SDF to conduct dynamic and sustainable
activities through joint operations based on the 2013 NDPG.
Meanwhile, Japan’s security environment is becoming more
testing and uncertain at a remarkably faster speed than
expected when the 2013 NDPG were formulated. On such
basis, the 2018 NDPG indicate that Japan will build a truly
effective defense capability that has honed the attributes of a
“Dynamic Joint Defense Force.”
Specifically, Japan will build a “Multi-Domain Defense
Force” with a truly effective defense capability that: (i) can
execute cross-domain operations, which organically fuse
capabilities in all domains, including not only traditional
domains—land, sea and air—but also new domains—space,
cyberspace and electromagnetic spectrum—, to generate
synergy and amplify the overall strength; (ii) is capable of
sustained conduct of flexible and strategic activities during

all phases from peacetime to armed contingencies; and (iii)
is capable of bolstering the ability of the Japan-U.S. Alliance
to deter and counter threats and promoting multi-faceted and
multi-layered security cooperation.
In particular, as capabilities in new domains, which
are space, cyberspace, and electromagnetic spectrum,
substantially enhance the military’s overall capabilities to
conduct operations, states are exerting efforts to improve
capabilities in these fields. Japan will also focus on enhancing
such capabilities as well as capabilities to effectively counter
attacks by aircraft, ships, and missiles in combination
therewith, and enhancing the sustainability and resiliency of
defense capability, including logistics support.


-----

**3** **NDPG’s Objective**


Japan’s national defense cannot be carried out by the MOD/
SDF alone, and it is essential to gain the understanding and
cooperation of each individual Japanese national concerning
defense policy. From such viewpoint, the 2018 NDPG
succinctly indicates its goals and awareness of issues in the
part “NDPG’s Objective” in a simple manner which is easy
to understand for nationals.
Specifically, the 2018 NDPG first sets forth that Japan
will vigorously march forward as a peace-loving nation even
while the security environment surrounding Japan becomes
more testing and uncertain, with changes in the balance of
power in the international arena accelerating and becoming
more complex, and uncertainty over the existing order
increasing, and the existing paradigm of national security
being fundamentally changed through rapid expansion
in the use of the new domains of space, cyberspace and
electromagnetic spectrum. Then, it goes on to state that, to
do so, Japan needs to fundamentally strengthen its national
defense architecture with which to protect, by exerting
efforts on its own accord and initiative, the life, person and
property of its nationals, territorial land, waters and airspace,
and its sovereignty and independence, thereby expanding
the roles Japan can fulfill. In addition, it sets forth that,
while no country can preserve its security by itself alone,
strengthening the Japan-U.S. Alliance as well as security
cooperation with other countries, which is critical to Japan’s
national security, cannot be achieved without Japan’s own
efforts, clearly expressing Japan’s attitude to make efforts on
its own accord and initiative. In this regard, the past NDPGs
have also been formulated based on the recognition that
Japan’s own efforts serve as the basis of the security policy,
but the 2018 NDPG has included this statement with an aim

**4** **Security Environment Surrounding Japan**

1 Characteristics of Current Security Environment


In order to formulate a new NDPG, it is necessary to make
in-depth analysis of the realities of the security environment
surrounding Japan, which lies in the background.
The 2018 NDPG analyzes the characteristics of the current
security environment as follows.
In the international community, thanks to further growth
of national power of such countries as China, changes in
the balance of power are accelerating and becoming more
complex, thereby increasing uncertainty over the existing


to put it down expressly.
On such basis, the 2018 NDPG states as follows. In
strengthening its defense capability, Japan must squarely face
the realities of national security and ensure necessary and
sufficient quality and quantity so as to build a truly effective
defense capability that does not lie on a linear extension of the
past. In particular, it has become essential that Japan achieve
superiority in the new domains, of space, cyberspace and
electromagnetic spectrum. To build a new defense capability
that combines strengths across all domains, Japan needs to
engage in a transformation at a pace that is fundamentally
different from the past, completely shedding the thinking
that relies on traditional divisions among land, sea, and
air. On the other hand, given the rapidly aging population
with a declining birthrate and severe fiscal situation, Japan
cannot strengthen its defense capability without thorough
rationalization that does not dwell on the past. In this manner,
the 2018 NDPG emphasizes that Japan needs to build defense
capability at a pace that is fundamentally different from the
past and to allocate resources without adhering to traditional
ways of thinking .
Moreover, the 2018 NDPG states that the Japan-U.S.
Alliance, together with Japan’s own defense architecture,
continues to be the cornerstone of Japan’s national security,
and that Japan’s fulfillment of its foremost responsibility as
a sovereign nation is the very way to fulfill its roles under
the Japan-U.S. Alliance and further enhance the Alliance’s
ability to deter and counter threats, and is a foundation upon
which to strategically promote security cooperation in line
with the vision of a free and open Indo-Pacific.

order. Against such a backdrop, prominently emerging is
inter-state competition across the political, economic, and
military realms, in which states seek to shape global and
regional order to their advantage.
This inter-state competition occurs on a continuous
basis: In conducting inter-state competition, states leverage
various means, such as undermining other country’s
sovereignty using military and law-enforcement entities, and
manipulating foreign country’s public opinion by exploiting
social media.
Also, the so-called gray-zone situations may possibly
increase and expand, and they harbor the risk of rapidly

developing into graver situations without showing clear
indications. In addition, methods employed to alter the status
quo, such as “hybrid warfare,” that intentionally blur the
boundaries between the military and non-military realms are
forcing affected actors to take complex measures not limited
to military ones.
Driven by rapid technological innovation in information
& communications and other fields, military technologies are
showing remarkable advances. Against the backdrop of such
technological advances, contemporary warfare increasingly
features capabilities combined across all domains: not
only land, sea, and air but also the new domains of space,
cyberspace, and electromagnetic spectrum. States are seeking
to gain superiority in technologies that undergird capabilities
in the new domains.
Due to advances in military technologies, a variety of
threats can now easily penetrate national borders. States
endeavor to develop weapons that leverage cuttingedge, potentially game-changing technologies. They also
engage in research of autonomous unmanned weapon
systems equipped with artificial intelligence (AI). Further
technological innovations hereafter are expected to make it
difficult still to foresee future warfare.
In the international community, there is a broadening
and diversifying array of security challenges that cannot be
dealt with by a single country alone. With respect to space
and cyber domains, establishing international rules and
norms has been a security agenda. In the maritime domain,
there have been cases where a country unilaterally claims
its entitlements or takes actions based on its own assertions
that are incompatible with the existing international order.
These have generated undue infringement upon freedom in


high seas. In addition, the proliferation of weapons of mass
destruction, including nuclear, biological and chemical
weapons, and ballistic missiles, as well as worsening
international terrorism remain grave challenges for the
international community.
Against such background, qualitatively and quantitatively
superior military powers concentrate in Japan’s surroundings
where clear trends are observed in further military build-up
and increase in military activities.

2 Situations by Country and Region


The 2018 NDPG analyzes the military trends of the
international community, particularly core countries that
form the security environment surrounding Japan, as follows.
The United States, with inter-state competition in a range
of areas prominently emerging, has acknowledged that a
particularly important challenge is strategic competition
with China and Russia, who attempt to alter global and
regional order. To rebuild its military power, the United
States is engaged in such efforts as maintaining military
advantage in all domains through technological innovations,
enhancing nuclear deterrence, and advancing missile defense
capabilities.
With an aim to build “world-class forces” by the mid-21st
century, China has sustained high-level growth of defense
expenditures with continued lack of transparency. China
has engaged in broad, rapid improvement of its military
power in qualitative and quantitative terms with a focus on
nuclear, missile, naval and air forces. In so doing, China is
ensuring superiority particularly in new domains including
space, cyberspace and electromagnetic spectrum, and also


**Chapter**


**“Gray-Zone Situations” and “Hybrid Warfare”**

The so-called gray-zone situations simply represents a wide range of situations that are neither peacetime nor wartime.
In a gray-zone situation, for example, a country that confronts another over territory, sovereignty or maritime and other
economic interests uses some forceful organization to demonstrate its presence in the relevant disputed region in a bid to
alter the status quo or force other countries to accept its assertions or demands.
The so-called hybrid warfare represents methods to alter the status quo while intentionally blurring the boundaries
between the military and non-military realms, forcing affected actors to take complex measures that are not limited to
military actions.
The means of hybrid warfare include operations using military units of unidentified nationality, cyberattacks to affect
communications and other critical infrastructure, the spread of false information through the internet and the media, and
other influential operations. The combination of these measures is considered as amounting to hybrid warfare.
Amid emerging inter-state competition, hybrid warfare and other various measures tend to cause gray-zone situations to
last for a long period of time.

community.
Russia is enhancing its military posture by continuing
force modernization efforts with a focus on nuclear forces.
Russia’s military activities are trending upward in the Arctic
Circle, Europe, areas around the United States and the Middle
East, as well as in the Far East, including Japan’s Northern
Territories. Close attention therefore needs to be paid to its
developments.

3 Characteristics of Japan


The 2018 NDPG describes the characteristics of Japan as
follows.
For Japan, a maritime nation, fundamental to its peace and
prosperity is to ensure the safety of maritime and air traffic
by strengthening the order of “Open and Stable Oceans.”
Japan is prone to natural disasters that exact heavy
damage. Industry, population and information infrastructure
concentrate in Japan’s urban areas, and a large number of
critical facilities such as nuclear power plants are located in
coastal areas.
In addition, Japan is undergoing population decline and
ageing with a dwindling birthrate at an unprecedented pace.

improving missile defense penetration capabilities and others.
China also engages in unilateral, coercive attempts to alter the
status quo based on its own assertions that are incompatible
with existing international order. In the East China Sea and
other waters, China is expanding and intensifying its military
activities at sea and in the air. Such Chinese military and
other developments, coupled with the lack of transparency
surrounding its defense policy and military power, represent
a serious security concern for the region including Japan and
for the international community. Japan needs to continue to
pay utmost attention to these developments.
Although North Korea expressed its intention for complete
denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula, it has not carried
out the dismantlement of all weapons of mass destruction and
ballistic missiles of all ranges in a complete, verifiable and
irreversible manner: There has been no essential change in
North Korea’s nuclear and missile capabilities. North Korea
is assessed as possessing large-scale cyber units, developing
capabilities to attack critical infrastructure. North Korea also
retains large-scale special operation forces. Such military
developments of North Korea pose grave and imminent
threats to Japan’s security and significantly undermine
the peace and security of the region and the international

**5** **Japan’s Basic Defense Policy**

1 Basic Policy


Based on the NDPG’s objective and the security environment
as mentioned above, the 2018 NDPG clarifies Japan’s basic
defense policy as follows.
First, in line with the National Security Strategy and from
the perspective of “Proactive Contribution to Peace,” Japan
has enhanced its diplomatic strength and defense capability.
Japan has also promoted cooperative relationships with other
countries, with the Japan-U.S. Alliance being a cornerstone.


**Chapter**


4 Summary


In light of the foregoing, the 2018 NDPG states that while
the probability of a large-scale military conflict between
major countries remains low, Japan’s security environment is
becoming more testing and uncertain at a remarkably faster
speed than expected when the 2013 NDPG was formulated.
On that basis, the 2018 NDPG specifies that, to prevent
threats to Japan from materializing to menace life and
peaceful livelihood of its nationals, it behooves Japan to take
measures that are in line with these realities.

In so doing, Japan under the Constitution has adhered to the
basic precept of maintaining the exclusively defense-oriented
policy and not becoming a military power that poses a threat
to other countries, ensured civilian control of the military,
and observed the Three Non-Nuclear Principles. Based on
this premise, Japan, even amid the realities of a security
environment it has hitherto never faced, must strive to
preserve national interests identified in the National Security
Strategy—defend to the end Japanese nationals’ lives,
persons and property, territorial land, waters and airspace,
and its sovereignty and independence.


-----

Under such circumstances, the 2018 NDPG sets forth (i)
the creation of a security environment desirable for Japan,
(ii) deterrence, and (iii) countermeasures as national defense
objectives. Specifically, they are as follows: first, to create,
on a steady-state basis, a security environment desirable
for Japan by integrating and drawing on the strengths at
the nation’s disposal; second, to deter threats from reaching
Japan by making opponents realize that doing harm to Japan
would be difficult and consequential; and finally, should
a threat reach Japan, to squarely counter the threat and
minimize damage.
Japan will strengthen each of the means by which to
successfully achieve these national defense objectives:
Japan’s own architecture for national defense; the JapanU.S. Alliance; and international security cooperation. These
efforts, including achieving superiority in new domains,
which are space, cyberspace, and electromagnetic spectrum,
must be carried out swiftly and flexibly in order to deal with
increasingly complex security environment that is changing
at an accelerating speed.
In dealing with the threat of nuclear weapons, U.S.
extended deterrence, with nuclear deterrence at its core,
is essential: Japan will closely cooperate with the United
States to maintain and enhance its credibility. To deal with
the threat, Japan will also increase its own efforts, including
comprehensive air and missile defense as well as civil
protection. At the same time, towards the long-term goal of
bringing about a world free of nuclear weapons, Japan will
play an active and positive role in nuclear disarmament and
non-proliferation.
The three approaches indicated as basic policy in the 2018
NDPG—Japan’s own architecture for national defense, the
Japan-U.S. Alliance, and international security cooperation—
are explained below.

2 Strengthening Japan’s Own Architecture for National
Defense


**(1) Building Comprehensive Architecture for National Defense**

What kind of national defense architecture should Japan
build in order to squarely address the realities of a security
environment that it has hitherto never faced and to securely
achieve national defense objectives? The NDPG first
indicates that Japan will, in all phases, integrate the strengths
at the nation’s disposal, enabling not only the MOD/SDF
efforts but also coherent, whole-of-government efforts,
as well as cooperation with local governments and private
entities. In particular, the NDPG clearly states that Japan will
accelerate its efforts and cooperation in such fields as space,

Navy (October 2018)

cyberspace, electromagnetic spectrum, ocean, and science &
technology, and also states that Japan will promote measures
concerning the formulation of international norms in fields
such as space and cyberspace.
Japan will further advance steady-state efforts such as
strategic communications[1] by systematically combining all
available policy tools.
In order to address a range of situations including armed
contingencies and “gray-zone” situations, Japan has been
strengthening its posture under the principle of civilian
control of the military. Japan further needs to seamlessly deal
with various situations in a coherent, whole-of-government
manner by way of swift and pertinent decision-making under
even stronger political leadership, which will be assisted by
an enhanced support mechanism.
In addition, Japan will also strengthen organization for
disaster response and civil protection, build a posture
prepared to evacuate Japanese nationals overseas during
emergencies and to ensure their safety, and promote
measures to protect infrastructure critical to people’s daily
lives, such as electricity and communication, as well as to
protect cyberspace.


**Chapter**


**(2) Strengthening Japan’s Defense Capability**
**a. Significance and Necessity of Defense Capability**

The NDPG defines defense capability as Japan’s will and
ability to defend to the end Japanese nationals’ lives, persons
and property as well as territorial land, waters and airspace
as a sovereign nation, by exerting efforts on its own accord
and initiative, which at the same time, is essential for Japan
to play, on its initiative, its roles in the Japan-U.S. Alliance.
Defense capability is essential also for advancing Japan’s
efforts in security cooperation with other countries.
On such basis, it emphasizes that defense capability is the
most important strength for Japan in retaining self-sustained

existence as a sovereign nation amid a security environment
that it has never faced before, and that Japan must strengthen
this capability on its own accord and initiative.

**b. Truly Effective Defense Capability—Multi-Domain Defense**
**Force**

As for the specifi c ideal form of defense capability, the NDPG
sets forth that Japan will newly aim to build a “Multi-domain
Defense Force,” given that Japan’s security environment is
becoming more testing and uncertain at a remarkably fast
speed. The Multi-domain Defense Force is specifi cally as
follows.
To deter and counter qualitatively and quantitatively
superior military threats, it has become vitally important to
adapt to warfare that combines capabilities in new domains—
space, cyberspace, and electromagnetic spectrum—and
traditional domains—land, sea, and air.
Japan needs to develop, while qualitatively and
quantitatively enhancing capabilities in individual domains, a
defense capability that can execute cross-domain operations,
which organically fuse capabilities in all domains to generate
synergy and amplify the overall strength, so that even when
inferiority exists in individual domains such inferiority will


be overcome and national defense accomplished.
At the same time, it is also important for Japan to be able
to seamlessly conduct activities at all stages from peacetime
to armed contingencies. In recent years, however, SDF’s
activities, such as maintaining its presence in peacetime, and
intelligence, surveillance and reconnaissance (ISR) activities,
which are increasing in scope and frequency, are causing a
chronic burden on its personnel and equipment, generating
a concern that the SDF may not be able to maintain the
profi ciency and the volume of its activities.
Japan needs to: improve the quality and quantity of
capabilities that support the sustainability and resiliency
of various activities; and develop a defense capability that
enables sustained conduct of fl exible and strategic activities
commensurate with the character of given situations.
Further, Japan’s defense capability needs to be capable of
strengthening the ability of the Japan-U.S. Alliance to deter
and counter threats as well as promoting multi-faceted and
multi-layered security cooperation.
In light of the foregoing, the NDPG states that Japan
will henceforth build a truly effective defense capability,
“Multi-Domain Defense Force,” which: organically fuses
capabilities in all domains including space, cyberspace


**Chapter**

In addition, in light of the society’s growing dependence
on space and cyberspace, it also pointed out that the SDF will
contribute to comprehensive, whole-of-government efforts
concerning these domains under appropriate partnership and
shared responsibility with relevant organizations.

**d. Large-Scale Disasters**

Defense capability also plays a signifi cant role when incidents
that have an enormous impact on people’s daily lives, such as
large-scale disasters, occur. The NDPG states that, in case of
disasters, the SDF will swiftly transport and deploy requisite
units to take all necessary measures for initial response,
and, as required, maintain its posture for disaster response
for a longer term. At the same time, the SDF will carefully
address the needs of affected citizens and local governments,
and engage in life saving, temporary repair and livelihood
support in appropriate partnerships and cooperation with
relevant organizations, local governments, and the private
sector.

3 Strengthening the Japan-U.S. Alliance


The NDPG states that the Japan-U.S. Security Arrangements
based on the Japan-U.S. Security Treaty, constitute a
cornerstone for Japan’s national security. While based on
the conventional recognition that the Japan-U.S. Alliance
plays a signifi cant role for the peace, stability and prosperity
of not only Japan, but also the region and the international
community, it also specifi cally indicates that Japan's
fulfi llment of its foremost responsibility as a sovereign
nation, through Japan's efforts to strengthen its own defense
capability on its own accord and initiative, is the very way
to fulfi ll its roles under the Japan-U.S. Alliance and further
enhance the Alliance’s ability to deter and counter threats.
On such basis, it clearly states as follows.
First, it has become all the more important for Japan’s
national security to further strengthen the relationship with
the United States, with whom Japan shares universal values
and strategic interests, and the United States also views that
cooperation with its allies has become more important. In
other words, the importance of the alliance has increased for
both the countries.
Next, while the Japan-U.S. Alliance has been reinforced
through activities including those that were made possible by
the Legislation for Peace and Security, Japan needs to further
enhance the Alliance through efforts under the “Guidelines for
Japan-US Defense Cooperation” as the security environment


**Chapter**


**e. Collaboration with the United States Based on the Japan-**
**U.S. Alliance**

The NDPG indicates that it is an important role of defense
capability to effectively conduct bilateral activities with the
United States by playing on its initiative its own roles in the
Japan-U.S. Alliance in all stages from peacetime to armed
contingencies, in line with the “Guidelines for Japan-U.S.
Defense Cooperation.”

**f. Promotion of Security Cooperation**

The NDPG clearly states that it is one of the roles of
defense capability to actively engage in efforts for enhanced
security cooperation by, for example, strategically promoting
defense cooperation and exchanges, such as joint training
and exercises, cooperation in defense equipment and
technologies, capacity building assistance, and serviceto-service exchanges, in accordance with policies that are
tailored to individual regions and countries.

surrounding Japan becomes more testing and uncertain at a
remarkably fast speed.
Furthermore, Japan needs to press ahead with such efforts
as bolstering the ability of the Alliance to deter and counter
threats, enhancing and expanding cooperation in a wide range
of areas, and steadily implementing measures concerning the
stationing of U.S. Forces in Japan.

4 Strengthening Security Cooperation


The NDPG places more importance than before on security
cooperation with other countries utilizing defense capability.
Specifically, it clearly states as follows. In line with the vision
of a free and open Indo-Pacific, Japan will strategically


promote multifaceted and multilayered security cooperation,
taking into account the characteristics and situation specific
to each region and country. As part of such efforts, Japan
will actively leverage its defense capability to work on
defense cooperation and exchanges which include joint
training and exercises, defense equipment and technology
cooperation, capacity building assistance, and service-toservice exchanges. Furthermore, Japan will also contribute
to address global security challenges.
The NDPG states that, in implementing these initiatives,
Japan should position the Japan-U.S. Alliance as its
cornerstone and will work closely with the countries that
share universal values and security interests, through full
coordination with its diplomatic policy.

**6** **Priorities in Strengthening Defense Capability**


also build a structure to conduct persistent space situation
monitoring. To ensure superiority in use of space at all stages
from peacetime to armed contingencies, the SDF will also
work to strengthen capabilities, including mission assurance
capability and capability to disrupt opponent’s command,
control, communications and information. In doing so, it will
make efforts to enhance cooperation with relevant agencies
and with the United States and other relevant countries, set
up a unit that specializes in space domain missions, and
develop human resources.


**Chapter**


1 Guiding Thoughts


In formulating the NDPG, it was provided that Japan will
build a truly effective defense capability that does not lie on
a linear extension of the past, in order to adapt to increasingly
rapid changes in the security environment.
While clearly indicating priority capability areas in
strengthening defense capability, the NDPG sets forth that
Japan will develop those areas as early as possible, allocating
resources flexibly and intensively without adhering to
existing budget and human resource allocation, and undertake
necessary fundamental reforms.
The priority capability areas specified in the NDPG are as
indicated below.

2 Priorities in Strengthening Capabilities Necessary for
Cross-Domain Operations


**(1) Acquiring and Strengthening Capabilities in Space,**
**Cyberspace and Electromagnetic Domains**

In cross-domain operations, capabilities in the new domains
of space, cyberspace and electromagnetic spectrum are
essential through focused resource allocation and utilization
of Japan’s superb science and technology. The NDPG clearly
states that the SDF will strengthen and protect command,
control, communications and information capabilities that
effectively connect capabilities in all domains and will
implement initiatives as follows.


**b. Capabilities in Cyber Domain**

In order to prevent attacks against the SDF’s information
and communications networks, the SDF will continue to
strengthen capabilities for persistent monitoring as well
as for damage limitation and recovery in case of attack. In
addition, the SDF will fundamentally strengthen its cyber
defense capability, including capability to disrupt, during
attack against Japan, opponent’s use of cyberspace for the
attack. In doing so, the SDF will significantly expand its
human resources with specialized expertise and skills and
contribute to whole-of-government efforts.

**c. Capabilities in Electromagnetic Domain**

The SDF will work to enhance information and
communications capabilities as well as information collection
and analysis capabilities related to electromagnetics, and
develop an information sharing posture. The SDF will
improve capabilities to minimize the effect of opponent’s
electronic jamming. In addition, the SDF will strengthen
capabilities to neutralize the radar and communications
of an opponent who intends to invade Japan. In order to
smoothly perform these activities, the SDF will enhance its

**Refurbishment of Izumo-class Destroyers**


Foreign countries have remarkably modernized their respective air forces in recent years and fi ghters and bombers have
increasingly fl own beyond Japan’s southwestern island chain into the Pacifi c Ocean. Military aircraft activities have
rapidly expanded and intensifi ed their fl ights in the Pacifi c. This situation had not been seen until after the formulation of
the 2013 NDPG, and such activities are expected to further expand and intensify in the future.
In expending all possible means to defend Japan in such situation, it is very important to ensure the fl exibility of
fi ghter operations by making more air bases available for high-performance fi ghters to be used for seamlessly securing
air superiority. Given that available runways are limited in our small country, fi ghters capable of Short Take-off and
Vertical Landing (STOVL) on destroyers would further contribute to improving the fl exibility of fi ghter operations and to
facilitating air defense in the Pacifi c, where Japan has only one air base (Iwo To) and where the SDF has limited operational
infrastructure.


**Chapter**


|Hyakuri Nyutabaru Naha Iwo To|(ima Minamitorishima island|

||Territorial sea EEZ|
||500km|


From this viewpoint, it is essential to refurbish Izumo-class destroyers to make take-off and landing of STOVL fi ghters
possible out on the sea so that, dealing with the new security environment, Japan secures its sea and air defense, including
the vast Pacifi c side, while ensuring the safety of SDF personnel. This is the minimum necessary measure for Japan’s selfdefense.

The Izumo-class destroyers are multi-function destroyers capable of helicopter, antisubmarine, command central,
personnel and vehicle transportation, medical and other operations. Even after the STOVL aircraft operation function is
added, they will continue to be utilized as multi-function destroyers, and will operate STOVL aircraft when necessary such
as in response to air attacks in time of emergency, and for ISR, training, and disaster response.


ability to appropriately manage and coordinate the use of
electromagnetic spectrum.

**(2) Enhancing Capabilities in Traditional Domains**

The NDPG states that the SDF will enhance capabilities in
traditional domains to effectively counter attacks especially
by aircraft, ships and missiles during cross-domain operations
in close combination with capabilities in space, cyberspace,
and electromagnetic domains.


operational capabilities, including Unmanned Underwater
Vehicles (UUV).
By taking measures such as developing a fi ghter force
structure that features Short Take-Off and Vertical Landing
(STOVL) fi ghter aircraft which bring operational fl exibility,
the SDF will improve air operation capability particularly on
the Pacifi c side of Japan, where the number of air bases is
limited despite its vast airspace. In so doing, as the number
of air bases that allow for take-off and landing of fi ghters
is limited, Japan will take necessary measures to enable
STOVL fi ghter aircraft to operate from existing SDF ships
as required, in order to further improve fl exibility in fi ghter
operations while ensuring the safety of SDF personnel.


**a. Capabilities in Maritime and Air Domains**

The SDF will reinforce its posture for conducting persistent
ISR at sea and in the air around Japan.
The SDF will also strengthen surface and underwater


-----

**b. Stand-Off Defense Capability**

The SDF will acquire stand-off firepower and other requisite
capabilities to deal with ships and landing forces attempting
to invade Japan, including remote islands, from the outside of
their threat envelopes. In addition, in order to appropriately
leverage advances in military technologies, Japan will swiftly
and flexibly strengthen stand-off defense capability through
measures such as comprehensive research and development
of related technologies.

**c. Comprehensive Air and Missile Defense Capability**

In order to counter diverse airborne threats of ballistic and
cruise missiles and aircraft, the SDF will establish a structure
with which to conduct integrated operation of various
equipment pieces, thereby providing persistent nation-wide
protection and also enhancing capability to simultaneously
deal with multiple, complex airborne threats. The SDF will
also study ways to counter future airborne threats.


3 Priorities in Strengthening Core Elements of Defense
Capability


The NDPG sets forth that the SDF will develop thorough
structure for Japan’s national defense, and enhance personnel,
industries, technologies, and information that serve as the
basis, in order to conduct sufficient activities.

**(1) Reinforcing Human Resource Base**

In light of the rapid progress of shrinking and aging
population with declining birth rates, the SDF needs to work
even further to reinforce human resource base that sustains
SDF personnel.
The MOD/SDF will promote efforts in order to secure
diverse, high-quality talents from a wider range of people.
These efforts include: various recruitment measures such
as cooperation with local governments and other entities;
diversifying the applicant pool; and expanding women’s
participation. The MOD/SDF will also promote manpower
saving and automation by leveraging technological
innovations such as artificial intelligence.
To enable all SDF personnel to fully exercise their ability
under high morale, the MOD/SDF will improve living and
work environments and promote work style reforms at the
MOD/SDF to ensure proper work-life balance.
Furthermore, through such efforts as enhancing joint
education and research, the MOD/SDF will enrich education
and research. The MOD/SDF will also enhance education for
organization management skills.


**Chapter**


**d. Maneuver and Deployment Capability**

In order for requisite SDF units to conduct sustained,
persistent activities in appropriate areas on a steady-state
basis and to maneuver and deploy according to the situation,
the SDF will strengthen amphibious operation and other
capabilities. In addition, to enable swift and large-scale
transport, the SDF will strengthen joint transport capability,
including inter- and intra-theater transport capabilities,
tailored to the characteristics of remote island areas. The
SDF will also work to collaborate with commercial transport
on a steady-state basis.

**(3) Strengthening Sustainability and Resiliency**

It is important to be able to secure and supply sufficient
ammunition and fuel and to achieve prompt recovery from
any damage caused to facilities when various situations
occur. The NDPG places importance on this point, and
states as follows. The SDF will take necessary measures for
securing ammunition and fuel, ensuring maritime shipping
lanes, and protecting important infrastructure. In particular,
while cooperating with relevant ministries and agencies, the
SDF will improve sustainability of activities through safe and
steady acquisition and stockpiling of ammunition and fuel.
The SDF will also improve resiliency in a multi-layered way
through efforts including dispersion, recovery from damage,
and substitution of infrastructure and other foundations for
the SDF operations, including defense-related facilities.
Further, the SDF will ensure high operational availability by
reviewing equipment maintenance methods.


**(2) Reviewing Equipment Structure**

The MOD/SDF will examine the existing equipment
structure from a joint operation perspective and build an
optimized equipment structure. In so doing, while giving due
considerations to the capabilities each SDF service requires
for its operations, the MOD/SDF will: develop equipment
with multiple functional variants; optimize and standardize
specifications; jointly procure equipment commonly used
across SDF services; reduce types of aircraft; suspend the
use of equipment whose importance has decreased; and
review or discontinue projects of low cost-effectiveness.

**(3) Reinforcing Technology Base**

The MOD/SDF will make focused investments through
selection and concentration in important technologies,
including artificial intelligence and other potentially gamechanging technologies. The MOD/SDF will also dramatically
shorten research and development timelines by streamlining
research and development (R&D) processes and procedures.
In addition, the MOD/SDF will reinforce its structure aimed
at fostering of innovative, emerging technologies by actively


-----

leveraging commercial technologies through such efforts as
technology exchange with relevant domestic and overseas
entities, and utilizing think tanks.

**(4) Optimizing Equipment Procurement**

In order to implement thorough cost management and
reduction, the MOD/SDF will promote active use of systematic
acquisition methods which facilitate efficient procurement,
streamlining of equipment maintenance, and competition
among domestic and foreign companies. Moreover, in
order to efficiently procure U.S.-made high-performance
equipment, the MOD/SDF will promote rationalization
of Foreign Military Sales (FMS) procurement[3] and further
strengthen efforts on project management throughout the
entire life cycle of defense equipment.


system to create a competitive environment for companies,
the MOD/SDF will work to reduce equipment costs and
improve industrial competitiveness, thereby striving to build
a resilient defense industrial base.

**(6) Enhancing Intelligence Capabilities**

The MOD/SDF will strengthen capabilities for each stage
of information collection, processing, analysis, sharing, and
protection so that the SDF can promptly detect and swiftly
respond to indications of various situations and also take
requisite measures based on medium- to long-term military
trends. In so doing, the MOD/SDF will strengthen capability
and posture for the collection of SIGINT, IMINT, HUMINT,
OSINT and others. The MOD/SDF will also enhance
collaboration with relevant domestic agencies, including
the Cabinet Satellite Intelligence Center which operates
Information Gathering Satellites, and with allies as well as
with other parties.


**(5) Strengthening Defense Industrial Base**

Through measures including reform of the existing contract

**7** **Organization of the SDF**


The NDPG states that, in order to realize cross-domain
operations, including in the new domains of space,
cyberspace, and electromagnetic spectrum, the SDF will
strengthen joint operations as described in 1 and develop the
organization of each SDF service as described in sections
from 2 to 4.


**Chapter**


The GSDF will maintain surface-to-air guided missile
units and ballistic missile defense units, the MSDF will
maintain Aegis-equipped destroyers, the ASDF will maintain
surface-to-air guided missile unit, and the SDF will build
comprehensive air and missile defense capability comprising
these assets.
The SDF will maintain a maritime transport unit as an
integrated unit that allows SDF units to swiftly maneuver

2 Organization of the GSDF


In order to be able to swiftly respond to various situations,
the GSDF will maintain rapidly deployable basic operational
units (rapid deployment divisions, rapid deployment brigades
and an armored division) furnished with advanced mobility
and ISR capabilities. The GSDF will also maintain mobile
operating units equipped with specialized functions, in order
to effectively perform operations such as: various missions
in cyber and electromagnetic domains.
The GSDF will maintain half of its rapidly deployable
basic operational units in Hokkaido.
The GSDF will strengthen its ability to deter and counter
threats by taking measures including persistent steady-state
maneuvers; and stationing of units in remote islands hitherto
without SDF presence.

With respect to basic operational units (divisions and
brigades) other than the rapidly deployable ones, the GSDF
will review their organization and equipment with a focus on
tanks, howitzers and rockets. With respect to units under the
direct command of regional armies, the GSDF will also review
their organization and equipment related to aerial firepower.
The GSDF will thoroughly implement rationalization and
streamlining of these units and appropriately position them
to meet the conditions and characteristics of each region.
The number of GSDF personnel will be maintained at
159,000.

3 Organization of the MSDF


The MSDF will maintain reinforced destroyer units including
destroyers with improved multi-mission capabilities (FFM),
minesweeper units, and embarked patrol helicopter units.
The MSDF will organize surface units composed of these
destroyer units and minesweeper units. In addition, the
MSDF will maintain patrol ship units to enable enhanced
steady-state ISR in the waters around Japan.
In order to effectively conduct steady-state, widearea underwater ISR, and to effectively engage in patrols
and defense in the waters around Japan, the MSDF will
maintain reinforced submarine units. By introducing a test

bed submarine, the MSDF will work to achieve greater
efficiency in submarine operations and accelerate capability
improvement, thereby enhancing persistent ISR posture.
In order to effectively conduct steady-state, wide-area
airborne ISR, and to effectively engage in patrols and defense
in the waters around Japan, the MSDF will maintain fixedwing patrol aircraft units.

4 Organization of the ASDF


The ASDF will maintain air warning and control units
consisting of ground-based warning and control units and
reinforced airborne warning units: ground-based warning
and control units are capable of conducting persistent
surveillance in airspace around Japan including vast
airspace on the Pacific side; and airborne warning units are
capable of conducting effective, sustained airborne warning,
surveillance and control during “gray zone” and other
situations with heightened tensions.
The ASDF will maintain fighter aircraft units reinforced
by high-performance fighter aircraft. In addition, the ASDF
will maintain reinforced aerial refueling and transport units.
The ASDF will maintain air transport units which enable
it to effectively carry out activities such as maneuver and
deployment of ground forces.
The ASDF will maintain unmanned aerial vehicle units
which enable it to conduct information collection in areas
relatively remote from Japan and persistent airborne
monitoring during situations with heightened tensions.


**Chapter**


**8** **Elements Supporting Defense Capability**


The NDPG sets forth that the following initiatives will be
emphasized as elements supporting defense capability, in
order for Japan’s defense capability to demonstrate its true
value.

1 Training and Exercises


The NDPG states that the SDF will conduct more practical,
effective and systematic training and exercises while work in
partnership with relevant organizations, local governments
and the private sector. In so doing, the SDF will develop and
utilize domestic training areas, such as those in Hokkaido as
well as fine training environments overseas; facilitate joint/
shared use of U.S. Forces facilities and areas; facilitate use
of places other than SDF facilities or U.S. Forces facilities
and areas; and more actively introduce training simulators
and others. The SDF will also actively utilize training and
exercises to constantly examine and review various plans for


emergencies.

2 Medical Care


The NDPG states that, in order to protect the lives of SDF
personnel to the maxim extent possible, the MOD/SDF will
strengthen its posture for medical care and onward transfer
of patients, seamlessly covering the entire stretch between
the frontline and final medical evacuation destinations.
Taking into account the conditions and characteristics of
each region, the SDF will focus on strengthening medical
functions of the SDF in Japan’s southwestern region. The
SDF will establish an efficient and high-quality medical
care regime through endeavors including upgrading of

operation units as well as placement of SDF garrisons and
bases. At the same time, in administering garrisons and
bases, the MOD/SDF will give due considerations to their
contributions to local economies.

4 Intellectual Base


The NDPG states that, in order to facilitate understanding
of security and crisis management among the populace, the
MOD/SDF will work to promote security-related education


at educational institutions. In order to achieve at high levels
both academic research and policy-support by the National
Institute for Defense Studies (NIDS), the MOD/SDF will
facilitate the NIDS’ collaboration with the policy-making
sector. The MOD/SDF will further enhance its defense
research regime with the NIDS playing central roles. In so
doing, the MOD/SDF will promote systematic collaboration
with other research and educational institutions within the
Government, as well as with universities and think-tanks of
excellence both at home and abroad.

**9** **Points of Attention**


In addition, considering increasingly severe fiscal
conditions and the importance of other budgets related to
people’s daily life, the MOD/SDF will work to achieve greater
efficiency and streamlining in defense force development to
curb costs. The MOD/SDF will work to ensure that defense
capability can smoothly and fully perform its functions
while harmonizing with other policies and measures of the
Government.


**Chapter**


Japan’s defense capability which the NDPG set forth
envisions approximately 10 years. The National Security
Council will conduct periodic, systematic evaluations
throughout the course of implementation of various measures
and programs. At the same time, the MOD/SDF will conduct
verifications regarding capabilities required for Japan’s
defense in the future.
When major changes in situation are anticipated during
evaluation and verification processes, the NDPG will be
amended as necessary after examining the current security
environment and others.

**New Medium Term Defense Program (MTDP), etc.**
### 4


**Section**
**1** **Outline of the MTDP (FY2019–FY2023)**


**1** **Background of Formulation of the MTDP (FY2019-FY2023)**


As the term of the MTDP (FY2014–FY2018)[1]was to end in
FY2018, discussions on formulating a new MTDP were held
in parallel to discussions on the National Defense Program
Guidelines for FY2019 and beyond (NDPG).

**2** **Signifi cance of the MTDP (FY2019–FY2023)**


While the build-up of defense capability is ultimately
conducted according to the budget of each fi scal year, it needs
to be conducted continuously and systematically based on a
specifi c, medium-term outlook, given that national defense
forms the basis of the nation’s existence and that activities
such as research and development (R&D) and introduction of
equipment, establishment of facilities, education of military
personnel, and training of SDF units cannot be accomplished
over a short term.
Accordingly, since FY1986, the Government has


On December 18, 2018, the Government formulated, at
the National Security Council and the Cabinet, the MTDP
(FY2019–FY2023)[2] in order to systematically build a Multidomain Defense Force in accordance with the NDPG.

formulated medium-term defense programs targeting each
fi ve-year period, and has conducted the build-up of defense
capability for each fi scal year based on the relevant program.
The MTDP (FY2019–FY2023) is the fi rst MTDP to be
implemented under the NDPG, and sets forth the policy for
the build-up of defense capability and the amount of major
equipment to be procured for the fi ve-year period, in order
to realize the Multi-domain Defense Force specifi ed by the
NDPG.


**Chapter**


**3** **Program Guidelines**


The MTDP (FY2019–FY2023) indicates that the SelfDefense Forces (SDF) will endeavor to build up defense
capability based on the following basic policy, in accordance
with the NDPG.

1 Acquiring and Strengthening Capabilities Essential for
Realizing Cross-Domain Operations


In order to realize cross-domain operations, the SDF will
acquire and strengthen capabilities in new domains, which
are space, cyberspace and electromagnetic spectrum, and
strengthen and protect command, control, communications
and information (C4I) capabilities that effectively connect
capabilities in all domains including the new ones. In
addition, the SDF will enhance capabilities in traditional


domains, such as capabilities in maritime and air domains,
stand-off defense capability, comprehensive air and missile
defense capability and maneuver and deployment capability.
Furthermore, sustainability and resiliency of defense
capability including logistics support will be enhanced.

2 Improving the Effi ciency of Acquisition of Equipment
and Reinforcing the Technology Base


In procuring equipment, by properly combining the
introduction of new, high performance equipment, with
life extension and improvement of existing equipment, the
Ministry of Defense (MOD)/SDF will effi ciently secure
defense capability in necessary and suffi cient “quality”
and “quantity”. In this regard, the MOD/SDF will strive to

-----

reduce the life-cycle costs and improve cost-effectiveness
by reinforcing project management. Moreover, the MOD/
SDF will make focused investments through selection and
concentration in cutting-edge technologies. The MOD/SDF
will also dramatically shorten R&D timelines by streamlining
its processes and procedures.

3 Reinforcing Human Resource Base


The MOD/SDF will comprehensively promote various
measures to reinforce human resource base such as securing
diverse and high-quality talents including diversifying
applicant pool, promoting women’s participation and
leveraging SDF Reserve Personnel, improving living and
work environment, promoting work style reforms, and
improving treatment, etc.


Cooperation. Japan will also actively facilitate measures for
the smooth and effective stationing of U.S. forces in Japan.
In line with the vision of free and open Indo-Pacifi c, to
strategically promote multifaceted and multilayered security
cooperation, Japan will promote defense cooperation and
exchanges which include joint training and exercises, defense
equipment and technology cooperation, capacity building
assistance, and interchanges among military branches.

5 Greater Effi ciency and Streamlining in the Build-Up of
Defense Capability


With respect to hedging against invasion scenarios such as
amphibious landing employing large-scale ground forces,
the SDF will retain forces only enough to maintain and carry
on the minimum necessary expertise and skills, by achieving
effi ciency and rationalization. In addition, considering
increasingly severe fi scal conditions and the importance of
other budgets related to people’s daily life, the MOD/SDF
will work to achieve greater effi ciency and streamlining in
defense force development while harmonizing with other
policies and measures of the Government.


4 Strengthening the Japan-U.S. Alliance and Security
Cooperation


Japan will further promote a variety of cooperative
activities and consultations with the United States, in a wide
range of areas under “Guidelines for Japan-U.S. Defense

**4** **Reorganization of the Major SDF Units**


The MTDP (FY2019–FY2023) indicates that the SDF will
conduct reorganization of its major units and others as
described below.


**Chapter**


The SDF will establish 1 squadron of Air Self-Defense
Force (ASDF) space domain mission unit for conducting
persistent monitoring of situations in space, and ensuring
superiority in use of space.
The SDF will establish 1 squadron of cyber defense unit
as a joint unit in order to fundamentally strengthen cyber
defense capabilities.
The SDF will strengthen the Joint Staff’s posture in order
to appropriately manage and coordinate, from an integrated
perspective, the use of electromagnetic spectrum, and
advance efforts to enhance defense capability related to the
use of electromagnetic spectrum in each SDF service.
In order to provide persistent nation-wide protection on a
steady-state basis and to be able to simultaneously deal with
multiple, complex airborne threats, the Ground Self-Defense
Force (GSDF) will establish 2 squadrons of ballistic missile


1 Joint Operation to Realize Cross-Domain Operations


In order to build a structure that is capable of realizing
cross-domain operations, the SDF will strengthen the Joint
Staff’s posture designed for effective SDF operations and for
new domains, thereby enabling swift exercise of the SDF’s
capabilities. For the future framework for joint operations,
the SDF will consider how to conduct the operation of
organizations in which the functions in the new domains are
operated unitarily, and consider how the integrated structure
should be during steady-state to appropriately execute
instructions from the Minister.

**Establishment of a Space Domain Mission Unit**

The space domain has become vital for the defense of Japan in various aspects, including the early detection of ballistic
missile launches, guiding of antiballistic missiles, communication between SDF units, and information gathering.
In response, an ASDF space domain mission unit will be established in order to conduct persistent monitoring of
situations in outer space, and to ensure superiority in this domain at all stages, from peacetime to armed contingencies. The
space domain mission unit is scheduled for establishment as a unit responsible for the space situation monitoring system
of Japan to be established by FY2022.
The ASDF will also establish new speciality dedicated to the space domain.


**Chapter**


**Establishment of a Cyber Defense Unit**

Today’s military activities heavily depend on information communication networks. In armed contingencies, it is highly
probable that command and communications systems will become targeted by cyber attacks aimed at the weakening of
operation execution capabilities. Furthermore, attackers have a huge advantage over defenders in the cyberspace.
In light of this situation the NDPG aims to fundamentally strengthen the cyber defense capabilities of the MOD/SDF. To
this purpose, the MTDP will establish a cyber defense unit as a joint unit.
Currently the Cyber Defense Group that is a joint unit of the GSDF, MSDF and ASDF is under the SDF C4 Systems
Command. This structure will be reviewed by FY 2023 to newly establish a cyber defense unit as a joint unit directly under
the Minister of Defense, the primary duty of which will be cyber defense.
The new cyber defense unit will have the capability to disrupt, during attack against Japan, an opponent’s use of
cyberspace for the attack and to train relevant personnel in addition to provide protection against cyber attacks.


**Strengthening Capabilities in the Electromagnetic Domain**

The MOD/SDF will strengthen its capabilities in the electromagnetic domain. It is not enough to simply strengthen
electronic warfare capabilities (see p.175 “Column: Electronic Warfare”). It is also necessary to acquire and enhance
electromagnetic spectrum management capabilities.
In modern combat scenes, the electromagnetic spectrum including radio waves is used in various fields, including
detection and search for opponent by radar, communication between units, and precise missile guidance. If the use of the
electromagnetic spectrum is disrupted, the SDF will not be able to execute its operations appropriately, leading to grave
consequences.
Causes of obstruction of electromagnetic spectrum use may include weather conditions, interference with the
electromagnetic spectrum used by other SDF units, and jamming by opponents. In order to reduce the impact of these
factors, it is necessary to grasp the electromagnetic spectrum frequencies available for each SDF unit, correctly instruct
which frequencies to use to prevent interference and weather influence and, when disturbed by an opponent, switch to a
spectrum less affected by the jamming. Appropriate implementation of these responses is called electromagnetic spectrum
management.
Electromagnetic spectrum management capabilities are essential for appropriate execution of an electronic warfare. The
MOD sets up dedicated departments at the Bureau of Defense Buildup Planning and the Joint Staff Office to accelerate
discussions for strengthening of the electromagnetic domain, including electromagnetic spectrum management capabilities.

defense (BMD) units. In addition, the ASDF will reorganize
surface-to-air guided missile units from 6 fire groups to 4 fire
groups while maintaining 24 fire squadrons.
The SDF will establish 1 group of maritime transportation
unit as Joint Unit that allows SDF units to swiftly maneuver
and deploy at all stages.

2 GSDF


In order to strengthen operation capabilities in new
domains, the GSDF will establish cyberspace units and
electromagnetic operation units as subordinate units of the
Ground Component Command.
In order to respond swiftly, and to deter and counter
effectively and swiftly with various situations, the GSDF will
transform 1 division and 2 brigades respectively into 1 rapid
deployment division and 2 rapid deployment brigades that
are furnished with advanced mobility and ISR capabilities.
In addition to rapid deployment divisions and brigades,
an amphibious rapid deployment brigade, which will be
strengthened by the establishment of 1 amphibious rapid
deployment regiment, will strengthen its ability to deter and
counter threats through conducting persistent steady-state
maneuver. In addition, the GSDF will strengthen its defense
posture of the remote islands in the southwest region by
continuing to establish area security units in charge of initial
response activities, surface-to-air guided missile units, and
surface-to-ship guided missile units. Furthermore, the GSDF
will take necessary measures to establish hyper-velocity
gliding projectile (HVGP) units for the defense of remote
islands.
The GSDF will steadily implement programs towards
successive formation of units equipped with mobile combat
vehicles and disuse of tanks deployed in basic operational
units stationed in locations other than Hokkaido and Kyushu.
In addition, the GSDF will steadily carry out programs
that concentrate howitzers deployed in basic operational


units stationed in locations other than Hokkaido into newly
organized field artillery units under the direct command of
the respective regional armies. Furthermore, the GSDF will
reduce its combat helicopter units under the direct command
of the respective regional armies and consider the review of
their deployment to operate them effectively and efficiently.

3 MSDF


For effective prosecution of persistent intelligence,
surveillance and reconnaissance activities (ISR), antisubmarine operations and mine countermeasure operations,
the MSDF will maintain 4 groups mainly consisting of 1
helicopter destroyer and 2 Aegis-equipped destroyers, and
maintain 2 groups consisting of new type of destroyers (FFM)
with improved multi-mission capabilities and minesweeping
vessels. The MSDF will newly establish surface units
composed of these destroyer units and minesweeper units.
In addition, the MSDF will establish patrol vessel units
to enable enhanced steady-state ISR. Furthermore, by
introducing a test submarine, which the type will be changed
from an existing submarine, the MSDF will work to achieve
greater efficiency in submarine operations and accelerate
capability improvement, thereby enhancing persistent ISR
posture. The MSDF will continue to take measures necessary
to increase the number of submarines.


**Chapter**


New type of destroyer (3,900-ton class) (image)


4 ASDF


In order to enhance the air defense posture and operate
effectively in airspace around Japan including vast airspace
on the Pacific side, the ASDF will reorganize 8 warning
groups and 20 warning squadrons to 28 warning squadrons
and establish 1 airborne early warning (AEW) wing as part
of air warning and control units, and take necessary measures
to establish 1 squadron of fighter aircraft units.
he ASDF will disband 1 squadron of tactical reconnaissance

and will establish 1 squadron of aerial refueling/transport
units.
In order to be able to conduct information collection in
areas relatively remote from Japan and persistent airborne
monitoring during situations with heightened tensions, the
ASDF will establish 1 squadron of unmanned aerial vehicle
(UAV) unit.

**5** **Major Programs regarding the SDF’s Capabilities**


The MTDP (FY2019–FY2023) states that the SDF will push
forward various programs, such as procurement of equipment,

**2** **Build-Up of Defense Capability in FY2019**


In FY2019, which is the first fiscal year for implementing the
NDPG and the MTDP, the MOD/SDF will steadily build up
its defense capability as a truly effective defense capability
toward building a Multi-domain Defense Force.
In particular, in order to realize cross-domain operations,
the MOD/SDF is acquiring and strengthening capabilities
in new domains, which are space, cyberspace and
electromagnetic spectrum. In addition, the MOD/SDF is
enhancing capabilities in maritime and air domains, standoff defense capability, comprehensive air and missile defense
capability, and maneuver and deployment capability, in order
to effectively deal with various situations by employing them
in combination with the capabilities in the new domains.
Moreover, in addition to enhancing the sustainability and
resiliency of defense capability including logistics support,
Japan gives priority to reinforcing the human resource base
in light of the aging population with a declining birth rate and


reinforcing the technology base due to advances in military
technologies. The MOD/SDF is also strengthening the JapanU.S. Alliance as well as security cooperation with other
countries in view of changes in the security environment.
At the same time, in this process, the MOD/SDF
will strengthen its defense capability at speeds that are
fundamentally different from the past and by allocating
resources flexibly and intensively. Furthermore, the MOD/
SDF will further promote joint-ness of the Ground, Maritime
and Air Self-Defense Forces in all areas and, avoiding a
stove-piped approach, optimize their organizations and
equipment.
In addition, considering the increasingly severe fiscal
conditions and other factors, Japan will strictly work to
achieve greater efficiency and streamlining.

of SDF personnel and the procurement of equipment
and others. Material expenses are further classifi ed into
“obligatory outlay expenses,”[1] which are paid based on
contracts concluded in previous fi scal years, and “general
material expenses,” which are paid under current-year
contracts. Material expenses are also referred to as “program


expenses,” and since general material expenses include repair
costs for equipment, education and training expenses for
personnel, and the purchase of fuel, they are referred to also
as “activity expenses.” The MOD terms this classifi cation
method as “classifi cation by expenses.”
Personnel and food provision expenses as well as
obligatory outlay expenses, both of which are mandatory
expenses, account for 80% of the total defense-related
budget. The remaining 20% of the budget includes spending
for repairing equipment and for implementing measures to
alleviate the impact on local communities hosting U.S. bases

Amount of future obligation

When improving defense capabilities, it is common for work in areas like the procurement of
equipment and the upgrading of facilities to be carried out over several years. Consequently, a
procedure is undertaken whereby a contract that extends for multiple years is arranged (five years
in principle), and the government promises in advance at the time of the agreement to make the
payment at a fixed time in the future. Future obligation refers to the sum of money to be paid in
the following year and beyond under such contracts, which extend for multiple years. Example: A
case in which 10 billion yen of equipment is procured under a contract that runs for four years.

Defense-related expenditures are broadly classified into personnel and food
provision expenses and material expenses (program expenses).

Some projects for build-up of defense capabilities extend over multiple years. In these cases, the fi scal year in which the contract is concluded is different from the fi scal year in which the
payment to the contractor is made. Therefore, the future maximum obligation is allocated to the budget as a contract resulting in a Treasury obligation (type of budget that only grants an
authority to incur obligations; the contracts can be concluded, but the payment cannot be made). Based on such budgeting, in the fi scal year in which the construction is completed or the
equipment is procured, expenses necessary for payment are allocated as budget expenditure, in principle (type of budget that grants authorities to incur obligations and make payment; the
contracts can be concluded and the payment can be made). Budget expenditure for payments incurred under contracts concluded in previous fi scal years is called “obligatory outlay
expenses,” while expenditure for future fi scal years is termed “future obligation”. For cases where a continued project over multiple years is necessary, there is also a system of continuing
expenditure as a means to grant the authority to incur obligations and make payment over multiple years by obtaining a resolution of the Diet integrally for the total cost and the amounts

for maintenance purposes. For this reason, the breakdown of
the defense-related expenditures cannot be easily altered in a
significant manner on a single-year basis.

such as aircraft hangars and barracks. Consequently, for
such items, a procedure is undertaken whereby a multi-year
contract is arranged, and it is promised in advance at the time
of the contract that payments will be made in the following
fiscal year and beyond (within five years, in principle). The
sum of money to be paid in the following fiscal year and
beyond, based on such a multi-year contract, is called the
amount of future obligation. The amount of future obligation
concerning new contracts arising in FY2019 increased from
the previous fiscal year by 407.4 billion yen (20.4%).

Furthermore, if looked at on a contract basis,[3] which
shows the scale of operations, there is an increase from the
previous fiscal year of 393.4 billion yen (13.2%).

See Part IV, Chapter 2, Section 3-1 (Project Management

Personnel and food provision expenses were decreased by
1.9 billion yen from the previous fiscal year, while obligatory
outlay expenses for the year increased by 84.1 billion yen.

General material expenses decreased by 14.1 billion yen
from the previous fiscal year.[2]

**3** **Initiatives for Increasing the Efficiency of Procurement**


Under the former MTDP, the MOD achieved cost reduction
of approximately 771 billion yen from FY2014 to FY2018
through the following measures: (1) utilization of long-term
contracts; (2) review of maintenance methods; (3) use of
civilian goods and review of specifications; (4) bulk purchase
of equipment; and (5) scrutiny of the prime cost.
In order to achieve further streamlining and rationalization
in the build-up of defense capability, the current MTDP sets
forth that the MOD will also carry out (6) suspension of
the use of equipment whose importance has decreased and
review of projects of low cost-effectiveness, in addition to
the five measures above.
In the FY2019 budget, the MOD aims to realize a
cost reduction of approximately 415.9 billion yen by
implementing the aforementioned streamlining measures.
Concrete initiatives introduced in the FY2019 budget are as
follows.

-  A reduction of approximately 35.6 billion yen by making
over five-years long-term contracts of bulk-purchase of
PAC-3 missile components (procured over ten fiscal years)
and bulk-procurement of nine E-2D airborne early warning
aircraft (procured over seven fiscal years).

-  A reduction of approximately 15.3 billion yen through
review of maintenance methods, such as consolidating
hardware and software.

-  A reduction of approximately 33.8 billion yen by using
civilian goods and reviewing specifications of equipment
from the viewpoint of cost-effectiveness, such as developing
digital learning materials for education to be used in place of
learning materials using actual equipment.

-  A reduction of approximately 16.3 billion yen through bulk
purchase of equipment in a single fiscal year, which could

**4** **Comparison with Other Countries**


It is not possible to accurately compare the amounts of defense
expenditures of countries due to a number of factors: there is
no internationally unified definition of defense expenditures
in the first place; even if defense expenditures were publicly
disclosed, their overall amount or their breakdown is
sometimes unclear; and the budget system varies by country.
On such basis, if Japan’s defense-related expenditures
and those of other countries officially published by each
government were converted into dollar amounts, using the
purchasing power parity[4] of each country reported by the
Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development
(OECD), the results would be as shown in Fig. II-4-3-5 (The

**1** **Background to the Development of Legislation**


The security environment surrounding Japan is increasingly
severe, and we are now in an era where threats could easily
spread beyond national borders, and no country can maintain
its own security only by itself any longer.
Against this background, it is first and foremost important
to advance vibrant diplomacy in order to maintain peace
and security of Japan, and ensure its survival, as well as to
secure its people’s lives. However, at the same time, it is also
necessary to prepare for the worst-case scenario.
Specifically, it is essential to avoid armed conflicts
beforehand and prevent threats from reaching Japan by
appropriately developing, maintaining and operating Japan’s
own defense capability, strengthening mutual cooperation
with the United States, which is Japan’s ally, and other
partner countries, and in particular, further elevating the
effectiveness of the Japan-U.S. Security Arrangements and
enhancing the deterrence of the Japan-U.S. Alliance for the
peace and stability of Japan and the Asia-Pacific region.
On that basis, in order to resolutely secure the lives and
peaceful livelihoods of its people under any situation and

of Security Legislation” with the Minister of Defense as
its Chairman, and conducted the deliberations towards the

Following this, in July 2014, a Cabinet Decision was made
on “Development of Seamless Security Legislation to Ensure
Japan’s Survival and Protect its People,” which set forth the

Conditions”[4] are satisfied. They are essential for Japan to
secure the lives and peaceful livelihoods of its people.
Following the longest extension of a Diet session in the
postwar, the longest Diet debate of security-related bills in
the postwar period was conducted, constituting about 116
hours of debate in the House of Representatives and about
100 hours of debate in the House of Councillors, totaling
about 216 hours. As a result, the two bills were passed at a
plenary session of the House of Councillors and enacted on
September 19, 2015, upon formation of a broad consensus,
with approval of not only the Liberal Democratic Party of
Japan and Komeito but also the three opposition parties of the
then Assembly to Energize Japan, the then Party for Future
Generations and the then New Renaissance Party (altogether
five parties out of the ten political parties).

Just before the passage, these five parties reached the
“Agreement Concerning the Legislation for Peace and
Security” (the “Five-Party Agreement”), which include
matters that should be taken into consideration in judging
the applicability of the Three New Conditions related to
the recognition of a “survival-threatening situation,” and
committed them to obtaining a conclusion on the shape of
a Diet organization for the constant surveillance and post—
verification of SDF activities based on the Legislation for
Peace and Security, and the strengthening of the Diet’s
involvement. The Government also made a Cabinet Decision
to the effect that the Government will respect the Five-Party
Agreement and handle these matters appropriately. The
Legislation for Peace and Security was put into force on
March 29, 2016.
With the security environment surrounding Japan becoming
increasingly severe, the enforcement of the Legislation
for Peace and Security has a historical significance. The
legislation, which enables the SDF to provide protection and
logistic support to U.S. naval vessels engaged in ballistic
missile defense, helps strengthen the deterrence and response
capability of the Japan-U.S. Alliance as a whole, thereby
further ensuring the peace and security of Japan through
making more proactive contributions to the peace and

**The Relationship between the Legislation for Peace and Security and the**
**Constitution**

The “use of force” is permitted under the Constitution

**●When an armed attack against Japan occurs or when an armed attack against a foreign country that is in a close**
relationship with Japan occurs and as a result threatens Japan’s survival and poses a clear danger to fundamentally
overturn people’s right to life, liberty and pursuit of happiness;

**●�When there is no other appropriate means available to repel the attack and ensure Japan’s survival and protect its**
people; and

**●�Use of force is limited to the minimum extent necessary,**
only when the Three New Conditions above are satisfied. Even for the “use of force” permitted under the Three New
Conditions, the basic logic of the constitutional interpretation presented in the Governmental view of 1972 (below)
has not changed:

**●�** The language of Article 9 of the Constitution appears to prohibit the “use of force” in international relations in all
forms. However, when considered in light of “the right (of all peoples of the world) to live in peace” as recognized
in the Preamble of the Constitution and the purpose of Article 13 of the Constitution which stipulates, “their (all of
the people’s) right to life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness” shall be the supreme consideration in governmental
affairs, Article 9 of the Constitution cannot possibly be interpreted to prohibit Japan from taking measures of selfdefense necessary to maintain its peace and security and to ensure its survival.

**●Such measures for self-defense are permitted only when they are inevitable for dealing with imminent unlawful**
situations where the people’s right to life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness is fundamentally overturned due to
an armed attack by a foreign country, and for safeguarding these rights of the people. Hence, the “use of force” to
the minimum extent necessary to that end is permitted.

 Furthermore, the “use of force” permitted under the Three New Conditions remains within the scope of the Supreme
Court decision on the Sunagawa Case. The Supreme Court decision states that

**●“it must be pointed out that it is natural for Japan, in the exercise of powers inherent in a state, to take measures for**
self-defense that may be necessary to maintain its peace and security, and to ensure its survival.”

 In other words, the decision can be interpreted as recognizing that Japan should be able to take “measures for selfdefense” to maintain its peace and security and ensure its survival after stating that Japan has the right to self-defense,
without making a distinction between the right to individual self-defense and the right to collective self-defense.
 As the Legislation for Peace and Security, which reflects the Three New Conditions described above in just
proportion, maintains the basic logic of the constitutional interpretation hitherto presented by the Government and
remains within the scope of the Sunagawa Case decision by the Supreme Court, the only institution endowed with the
power to finally determine the constitutional interpretation, it is consistent with the Constitution.

The Act on the Peace and Independence of Japan and
Maintenance of the Nation and the People’s Security in Armed
Attack Situations, etc., and a Survival-Threatening Situation[2]
specifies items that should be stipulated as basic principles
and basic policies (the Basic Response Plan) regarding
responses to Armed Attack Situation and Anticipated Armed Attack
Situation, etc., and Survival-Threatening Situations as well as the
responsibilities of national and local governments in the event
of an armed attack.
Previously, the aforementioned legislation stipulated
responses to Armed Attack Situations, etc. However, considering
the changes in the security environment surrounding Japan,
a “Survival-Threatening Situation” was newly added to the
situations to which Japan is to respond as an armed attack since
even if it occurs against a foreign country it could threaten
Japan’s survival as well, depending on its purpose, scale and
manner. Following this, the SDF Law was also amended to
define responses to such a situation as one of the SDF’s primary
duties as unavoidable self-defense measures for Japan’s defense
along with some other changes.

**KEY WORD**


Armed Attack Situation and Anticipated Armed
Attack Situation

-  An armed attack situation means a situation where an armed attack
against Japan from outside has occurred or an imminent and clear danger
of the armed attack against Japan is acknowledged.

-  An anticipated armed attack situation means a situation where an armed
attack has yet to occur, but circumstances are growing increasingly
strained and an armed attack is anticipated. (These situations are referred
to as “Armed Attack Situation, etc.” collectively.)

**KEY WORD**


Survival-Threatening Situation

A Survival-Threatening Situation means a situation where an armed attack
against a foreign country that is in a close relationship with Japan occurs,
which in turn poses a clear risk of threatening Japan’s survival and of
overturning people’s rights to life, liberty and pursuit of happiness
fundamentally.

**Chapter**


**(7) Revisions to Other Relevant Legislation**
**a. Act Related to the Actions of the U.S. Forces and Others[3]**

Before the revision, the U.S. Military Actions Related
Measures Act specified measures, etc., to be taken to ensure
smooth and efficient operation of the U.S. Forces necessary
to terminate an armed attack in Armed Attack Situations,
etc., based on the Japan-U.S. Security Treaty. In addition
to support for the U.S. Forces responding to Armed Attack
Situations, etc., support operations for the armed forces of
foreign countries other than the United States in Armed
Attack Situations, etc., as well as support operations for the
U.S. Forces and the armed forces of other foreign countries in
Survival-Threatening Situations were added in the revision.
**b. Maritime Transportation Restriction Act[4]**

The previous Maritime Transportation Restriction Act had
provided procedures for stopped ship inspections and taking
ship measures conducted by the Maritime Self-Defense Force


Following the addition of Survival-Threatening Situations, the title of the Act was revised from “Law Concerning the Measures Conducted by the Government in Line with the U.S. Military
Actions in Armed Attack Situations, etc.” to “Law Concerning the Measures Conducted by the Government in Line with U.S. and Other Countries’ Military Actions in Armed Attack Situations,
etc., and Survival-Threatening Situations.”

Following the addition of Survival-Threatening Situations, the title of the Act was revised from “Law Concerning the Restrictions of Maritime Transportation of Foreign Military Supplies, and
Others in Armed Attack Situations, etc.” to “Law Concerning the Restrictions of Maritime Transportation of Foreign Military Supplies, and Others in Armed Attack Situations, etc., and
S i l Th t i Sit ti ”

(MSDF) to control maritime transportation of weapons,
ammunition and military personnel, etc., to armed forces,
etc., of foreign countries making armed attacks against
Japan in Armed Attack Situations. The revision Act added
the provisions to control maritime transportation in SurvivalThreatening Situations. Furthermore, the waters in which the
MSDF can take these measures. According to the revised law
the MSDF can control maritime transportation in Japan’s
territorial waters, territorial waters of foreign countries (only
when their consent is obtained) and the high seas, although it
was previously restricted to Japan’s territorial waters and the
high seas surrounding Japan.
**c. Prisoners of War Act[5]**

The Prisoners of War Act previously specified items necessary
for the detention, internment and other forms of treatment
of prisoners of war, etc., in Armed Attack Situations in
order to ensure the appropriate practice of the International
Humanitarian Law regarding the treatment of prisoners of
war, etc. The provisions were added for the application of
the Prisoners of War Act in Survival-Threatening Situations
as well.
**d. Act Regarding the Use of Specific Public Facilities[6]**

To ensure the appropriate and rapid operations of the SDF
and the U.S. Forces and measures vital to the protection
of the people, the Act Regarding the Use of Specific
Public Facilities provides for procedures to be taken for
comprehensive coordination of the use of specific public
facilities (ports, airports, roads, waters, air zones and radio
waves) in Armed Attack Situations, etc. The operations of
the armed forces of foreign countries other than the U.S.
Forces in Armed Attack Situations, etc., were added to the

scope of coordination of the use of specific public facilities.

2 Emergency Situations other than Armed Attack
Situations, etc., and Survival-Threatening Situations


The Act on the Peace and Independence of Japan and
Maintenance of the Nation and the People’s Security in
Armed Attack Situations, etc., and Survival-Threatening
Situations provides for appropriate and rapid response


measures to be implemented in emergency situations other
than an Armed Attack Situation and Survival-Threatening
Situations in order for the Government to ensure the peace
and independence of the country, and to maintain the security
of the country and its people.[7]

3 Responses of the SDF


**(1) Positioning as the Mission of the SDF**
The primary duty of the SDF had been to “defend Japan
against direct or indirect aggression.” Now since the purpose
of the SDF’s operation in Survival-Threatening Situations
stemming from an armed attack on a foreign country is also
to defend japan as well, the revised legislation stipulates this
is one of the SDF’s primary duties.


**(2) Defense Operation**
Although an Armed Attack Situation, had been the only
situation in which a Defense Operation order may be issued,
the revised legislation newly added Survival-Threatening
Situations to this category. Following this revision, the
Prime Minister can now issue a Defense Operation order to
the whole or part of the SDF when it is deemed necessary
for the defense of Japan in Armed Attack Situations and
Survival-Threatening Situations. As it had been before the
law revision, prior Diet approval is required for a Defense
Operation order in principle. The SDF under Defense
Operation duty is allowed to exercise the use of force only
when the “New Three Conditions” are satisfied.[8]

**(3) Others**
Among the provisions setting forth a variety of authorities
and special measures, etc., necessary for SDF operations on
a Defense Operation order, those whose purpose is entirely
to respond to direct armed attack on physical damage
against Japan are not to be applied to Survival-Threatening
Situations.[9]


**Chapter**


Following the addition of Survival-Threatening Situations, the title of the Act was revised from “Law Concerning the Treatment of Prisoners of War and Other Detainees in Armed Attack
Situations, etc.” to “Law Concerning the Treatment of Prisoners of War and Other Detainees in Armed Attack Situations, etc., and Survival-Threatening Situations.”

The official title of the Act is the “Law Concerning the Use of Specific Public Facilities and Others in Armed Attack Situations, etc.”

A contingency situation other than an Armed Attack Situation and a situation where an armed attack against a foreign country resulting in a threat to Japan’s survival that may have a
significant impact on the security of the nation and its people, including an emergency response situation (a situation where actions that may kill or injure many people by using methods
equivalent to those used in an armed attack, or a situation where it is recognized that the relevant actions represent a clear and present threat that necessitate an emergency response by
the state).

In general, the “use of force” in Paragraph 1, Article 9 of the Constitution means the act of combat by Japanese physical and personnel organizations as part of an international armed
conflict. In contrast to this, the “use of weapons” as referred to in the SDF Law, etc., means the use of equipment and machinery, etc., designed to directly kill or harm people, or to destroy
things as a means of armed fighting, in accordance with their original usages. While the “use of force” in Paragraph 1, Article 9 of the Constitution is the idea related to resorting to force,
including the “use of weapons,” all types of the “use of weapons” do not necessarily fall under the category of the “use of force” prohibited under Article 9 of the Constitution. The “use of
force” is permitted under the Constitution only in cases where the New Three Conditions (See Page 166) are satisfied.

The examples of application in Survival-Threatening Situations include the organization of special units, and the defense call-up of SDF Reserve Personnel and SDF Reserve Personnel,
etc., while the examples of non-application, which mean the examples of application only in Armed Attack Situations, etc., in other words, include measures for the construction of defense

armed attack induced disasters in order to protect the lives,
bodies and property of the people and to minimize influence
on its livelihood in the case of Armed Attack Situations, etc.,
or emergency response situations.
If the Minister of Defense finds it unavoidable after
receiving a request from prefectural governors,[11]or receives
a request from the Task Force Chief, upon approval by the
Prime Minister, the Minister of Defense can issue civil
Protection Dispatch Order to the SDF units, etc. to civil
protection dispatch to conduct civil protection measures or
emergency response protection measures (including assisting
the evacuation of residents, providing relief to the evacuees
and immediate restoration).

**and Civil Protection Measures**
The Civil Protection Act, stipulates necessary measures,
including issuance of warnings and measures for the
evacuation and relief of residents from the perspective of
protection of the people and their livelihood from a direct
attack against Japan and physical damage. A situation in
which the rules of Survival Threatening Situations are
applicable and warning issuance and evacuation and relief of
residents are required is nothing less than a situation where
an armed attack against Japan is anticipated or imminent. In
such a case, it is recognized as Armed Attack Situations, etc.,
and necessary measures are to be implemented under the
Civil Protection Act.[12]

surrounding Japan.
In accordance with the changes in the security
environment surrounding Japan, the law revision deleted “in

important influence on Japan’s peace and security in areas
surrounding Japan” and changed the name of situations from
“situations in areas surrounding Japan” to “situations that will


**Chapter**


Previously, the Law Concerning Measures to Ensure the Peace
and Security of Japan in Situations in Areas Surrounding
Japan had stipulated rear area support,[13] rear area search and
rescue operations[14] and ship inspection operations (those set
forth in the Ship Inspection Operations Law) conducted by
Japan as measures to respond to situations that will have an
important influence on Japan’s peace and security in areas


10 The official title of the act is the Act Concerning the Measures for Protection of the People in Armed Attack Situations, etc.

11 The Prime Minister assumes the position of the Director of the Crisis Management Headquarters, but these positions are regulated as separate entities.

12 In the case that an armed attack against a foreign country resulting in threatening Japan’s survival is not regarded as an armed attack situation, etc., a series of measures are to be
implemented to ensure the stability of the people’s livelihood, including a stable supply of daily necessities, based on a variety of existing laws and regulations, taking thorough response
measures to protect people’s livelihood without invoking the Civil Protection Act.

13 Rear area support under the Law Concerning Measures to Ensure the Peace and Security of Japan in Situations in Areas Surrounding Japan means support measures, including the
provision of goods, services, and conveniences, given by Japan in rear areas to the U.S. Forces conducting activities that contribute to the achievement of the objectives of the Japan-U.S.
Security Treaty in situations in areas surrounding Japan.

14 Rear area search and rescue operations under the Law Concerning Measures to Ensure the Peace and Security of Japan in Situations in Areas Surrounding Japan mean operations
conducted by the SDF in situations in areas surrounding Japan to search and rescue those who were engaged in combat and were stranded in rear areas (including transportation of those

have an important influence, **[15] and also extended the scope**
of militaries that the SDF can support and add new types of
response measures as follows.

1 Militaries that the SDF Supports


On top of the existing “U.S. Armed Forces engaged in
activities contributing to the achievement of the objectives
of the Japan-U.S. Security Treaty,” the revised law added
“armed forces of other foreign countries engaged in
activities contributing to the achievement of the objectives
of the UN Charter” and “other similar organizations” on the
armed forces, etc., responding to situations that will have an
important influence on Japan’s peace and security, which the
SDF is allowed to support.



-  The SDF does not conduct activities in the scene where
a combat is actually taking place.” Regarding search and
rescue operations, however, when stranded personnel have
been located and rescue operations have commenced, the
SDF units are allowed to continue search and rescue activities
as long as the safety of these units is ensured.

-  The commanding officers, etc., of the SDF units order the
temporary suspension of activities, etc., if combat operations
occur or are expected to occur at the site of their activities or
in the vicinity.

-  The Minister of Defense designates the area for
implementing activities, and if it is deemed difficult to
implement operations smoothly and safely in the whole or
part of that area, the Minister must promptly change the
designation of the area or order the cessation of the activities
being implemented there.

4 Diet Approval


As before the law revision, prior diet approval is required,
in principle, and ex-post facto approval is also allowed in
emergency.


2 Response Measures to Situations that Will Have an
Important Influence on Japan’s Peace and Security


The revised law sets out measures to respond to situations
that will have an important influence on Japan’s peace and
security as (1) logistics support activities, (2) search and
rescue activities, (3) ship inspection operations, and (4)
other measures necessary to respond to situations that will
have an important influence on Japan’s peace and security,
and added “lodging, storage, use of facilities and training
services” as the types of goods and services provided by the
SDF in (1) logistics support activities, on top of the “supply,
transportation, repair and maintenance, medical activities,
communications, airport and seaport services, and base
services” previously. While the provision of weapons is not
included, as before, the revised law allows the “provision
of ammunition” and “refueling and maintenance of aircraft
ready to take off for combat operations.”
The revised law made it possible to implement response
measures in foreign territories, but only when the foreign
country concerned consents.

3 Measures to Avoid Integration with the Use of Force


The revised law sets forth the following measures in order to
avoid integration with the use of force by a foreign country
and also to ensure the safety of SDF personnel:


5 Authority for the Use of Weapons


When engaged in logistics support activities or search and
rescue activities in the event of a situation that will have an
important influence on Japan, SDF personnel are permitted to
use weapons if necessary in order to protect oneself or other
SDF members who are at the same scene, or those under
the supervision of oneself (so-called “the use of weapons
of self-preservation type”). In addition, SDF personnel are
permitted to use weapons jointly with members of the armed
forces or other organizations of foreign countries in order to
protect the lives and bodies of those stationed at the camps
(however, inflicting injury on a person is permitted only in
the cases of legitimate self-defense and aversion of clear and
present danger in “the use of weapons of self-preservation
type”).

6 Ship Inspection Operations


**(1) Outline[16]**


**Chapter**


15 Previously, “situations in areas surrounding Japan” was understood to be an idea that focuses on the nature of situations, not a geographical idea. In light of the changes in the security
environment in recent years, however, the definition was revised since it is not appropriate to use an expression that could be interpreted as geographically limiting areas where situations
that will have an important influence on Japan’s peace and security may arise. In association with this, the title of the Law was amended from the “Law Concerning Measures to Ensure
the Peace and Security of Japan in Situations in Areas Surrounding Japan” to the “Law Concerning Measures to Ensure the Peace and Security of Japan in Situations that Will Have an
Important Influence on Japan’s Peace and Security.”

16 Inspection of ships in the case of a situation that will have an important influence on Japan’s Peace and Security is conducted based on the “Law Concerning Ship Inspection Operations in
Situations that Will Have an Important Influence on Japan’s Peace and Security and Other Situations (Ship Inspection Operations Act).” See Article 5 of this section (Framework for
Contributing to the Peace and Stability of the International Community) for ship inspection operations in situations threatening the international peace and security that the international

**(1) Public Security Operations by Order**
In the event of an indirect aggression or another emergency
situation, the Prime Minister can order the whole or part of the
SDF to deploy if it is deemed impossible to maintain public
security with the general police force. In principle, the Prime
Minister must bring the order to the Diet for deliberation, and
request for its approval within twenty days from the day the
order has been given.

**(2) Public Security Operations by Request**
Upon consulting with the Public Safety Commission of the
prefecture concerned, the governor of that prefecture can
request the Prime Minister to dispatch units, etc., of the
SDF if it is deemed unavoidable as the situation will have
a serious influence on public security. Following such a
request, the Prime Minister can order the SDF to mobilize
when a situation calls for such action.


**(1) Outline**
When there is a special need to protect lives or property
or maintain public security at sea, the Minister of Defense
can order SDF units to take necessary actions at sea upon
approval by the Prime Minister.

**(2) Authority for the Use of Weapons**
The provisions of Article 7 of the Police Duties Execution
Act apply mutatis mutandis to the execution of duties of SDF
personnel, permitting them the use of weapons. In addition,
partial application of the Japan Coast Guard Law[21] allows
SDF personnel to exercise authority such as requesting
nearby persons or ships to cooperate or boarding on other
ships for inspection. The use of weapons is also permitted in
order to stop a ship when certain conditions are met.

the Minister of Defense may order SDF units to conduct
operations at sea against such acts upon approval by the
Prime Minister. In order to obtain approval, the Minister of
Defense shall create a response guideline and submit it to the
Prime Minister.


**(3) Authority for the Use of Weapons**
Article 7 of the Police Duties Execution Act applies mutatis
mutandis to the execution of duties of SDF personnel,
permitting SDF personnel the use of weapons.[18] Moreover,
SDF personnel are permitted to use weapons to the extent
judged to be reasonable depending on the situation when
certain conditions are met.[19][,][20]

Guerillas and Special Operations Forces, etc.)


17 The state that has the right to fly its flag as prescribed in Article 91 of the UN Convention on the Law of the Sea.

18 Article 7 of the Police Duties Execution Act (Use of Weapons) permits the use of weapons if deemed reasonably necessary in accordance with the situation. However, causing harm to
people is permitted only in cases of legitimate self-defense or evasion of clear and present danger.

19 The “certain conditions” defined herein apply to cases such as when SDF personnel reasonably consider that persons to be guarded in the line of duty and others may suffer violence or
infringement, or are apparently exposed to such danger and no appropriate means of overcoming it other than the use of weapons exist.

20 Article 16, 17-1, 18, and Article 20-2 of the Japan Coast Guard Law applied mutatis mutandis to public security operation.

**Acceleration of Procedures to Issue Orders for Public Security Operations and**
**Maritime Security Operation**

Considering the increasingly severe security environment surrounding Japan, situations that are neither pure peacetime nor
contingencies (the so-called gray zone situations) are liable to occur, posing risks which could develop into more serious
situations. In order to respond promptly to such situations of infringement that do not amount to an armed attack, and ensure
seamless and sufficient responses to any unlawful acts, the Government made cabinet decisions regarding the acceleration
of procedures to issue orders for public security operations and maritime security operations, etc., in May 2015, particularly
in the following three cases:

**●** Responses to foreign naval vessels making maritime navigation through the territorial sea or the internal waters of

Japan that does not fall under the category of innocent passage under international law

**●** Responses to the unlawful landing on a remote island or its surrounding seas by an armed group

**●** Responses to acts of infringement when SDF ships or aircraft detect foreign ships committing said acts against

Japanese private ships on the high seas

Specifically, when an urgent decision is necessary concerning the issuance of orders for public security operations, etc., but
it is difficult to promptly convene an extraordinary cabinet meeting, the Prime Minister can preside over a cabinet meeting
to make the decision by obtaining the consent of the Ministers of State by telephone and other means. Any Minister of State
who could not be contacted in advance shall be notified of the cabinet decision ex post facto.

other means (any Minister who could not be contacted in advance shall be notified of the cabinet decision ex post facto).


**(2) Authority for the Use of Weapons**
SDF personnel may use weapons in executing duties under
Article 7 of the Police Duties Execution Act. When there
are reasonable grounds to believe that no other means are
available to stop the passage of a ship perpetrating acts of
piracy, including approaching excessively close to a nonmilitary ship, the use of weapons is permitted to the extent
that is considered reasonably necessary in accordance with
the situation.

See Part III, Chapter 3, Section 2-1 (Counter-Piracy Operations)


4 Destruction Measures against Ballistic Missiles


In case ballistic missiles[22] or other objects launched at Japan
as an armed attack against Japan or a Survival-Threatening
Situation, and the New Three Conditions are simultaneously
met, the SDF would cope with the situation by a Defense
Operation order. On the other hand, if ballistic missiles
are flying towards Japan, but the situation cannot be
acknowledged as an armed attack, the Minister of Defense
can take the following measures:
(1) When it is anticipated that ballistic missiles or other

-----

objects are flying towards Japan and it is deemed necessary
to take measures to protect lives and properties in Japan’s
territory if they fall to the ground, upon approval by the
Prime Minister, the Minister of Defense may order the SDF
units to take measures to destroy the ballistic missiles in
airspace over Japan’s territory or high seas once they have
actually been launched towards Japan.
(2) Also, besides the case of (1), the Minister of Defense may
not have enough time to get approval by the Prime Minister
when the situation unfolds rapidly such as the cases when
there was no warning prior to the launch. In preparation for
such case, the Minister of Defense may create an emergency
response guideline and get approval by the Prime Minister
in peacetime. Based on this emergency response guideline,
the Minister of Defense can order the SDF units to take
measures to destroy ballistic missiles or other objects in the
airspace over Japan’s territory or high seas in advance for a
certain period of time once they have actually been launched
towards Japan.

Ballistic Missile Attacks, etc.)


bodies, and rescue of Japanese nationals, etc. overseas
involving the use of weapons was not allowed even in cases
of terrorist attacks. In light of these circumstances, the newly
established provisions enable the units of the SDF to take
“rescue” that go beyond transportation and include guarding
and rescue of Japanese nationals, etc. overseas whose lives
or bodies could be harmed in emergency situations when the
following requirements are satisfied:[24]

**(1) Procedures**
Upon a request from the Minister for Foreign Affairs and
after subsequent consultations between the Minister for
Foreign Affairs and the Minister of Defense, the Minister
of Defense issues an order following approval by the Prime
Minister.


**(2) Requirements for Implementation**
When all of the following conditions are satisfied, the rescue
measures may be implemented:
a. It needs to be confirmed that in the areas where the rescue
measures are taken, the competent authorities of the
country concerned are maintaining public safety and order
at the time, and no act of combat will be conducted;
b. The country concerned[25] consents to the SDF taking the
rescue measures (including the use of weapons); and
c. It is expected that coordination and cooperation can be
ensured between the units of the SDF and the competent
authority of the country concerned in order to carry out
the rescue measures as smoothly and safely as possible in
response to anticipated dangers.

**(3) Authority for the Use of Weapons**
In carrying out their duties to implement the rescue
measures, SDF personnel are permitted to use weapons to
the extent judged to be reasonably necessary, depending on
the situation when there are adequate grounds to recognize
the compelling need to use weapons to protect the lives
and bodies of Japanese nationals and others or themselves,
or to eliminate actions that obstruct their duties (including
the permission to resort to the so-called “use of weapons in
defense of the mission mandate.”[26] However, causing harm
to people is permitted only in cases of legitimate self-defense


**Chapter**


5 Measures against Intrusion of Territorial Airspace


The Minister of Defense may order SDF units to take necessary
measures to make intruding aircraft land or withdraw from
the territorial airspace of Japan (guiding intruders away,
issuing radio transmission warnings, use of weapons,[23] etc.)
when a foreign aircraft intrudes Japan’s territorial airspace in
violation of international law, the provisions of the Aviation
Law or other relevant laws and regulations.

See Part III, Chapter 1, Section 2-1-2 (Measures in Response to
Actions that Violate Japan’s Sovereignty)


6 Rescue and Transportation of Japanese Nationals Overseas24


Previously, operations to protect Japanese nationals, etc.
overseas in emergency situations were limited to transporting
to safe places those who need protection of their lives or


23 Although there is no clear provision regarding the use of weapons, it is interpreted to be included in the “necessary measures.”

24 The MOD/SDF has conducted the transportation of Japanese nationals overseas in four cases.

Responding to the kidnapping of foreigners and Japanese in Iraq, 10 Japanese were evacuated to Kuwait by ASDF C-130H plane in April 2004.
In January 2013, a government aircraft was deployed to bring seven Japanese nationals and the remains of a further nine nationals back to Japan following the kidnapping in Algeria.
With respect to the terrorist attack in Dhaka, Bangladesh, which occurred in July 2016, the bodies of Japanese victims (seven nationals), their families, and other involved parties were
transported to Japan by government aircraft.

In relation to the deterioration of the situation in South Sudan in July of the same year, the ASDF transport aircraft C-130H transported four embassy staff from Juba to Djibouti.
25 It includes an organization, if any, that administers the said country in accordance with a resolution of the General Assembly or the Security Council of the UN.

26 While the so-called “right to use weapons of self-preservation type” permits the use of weapons only for the protection of oneself and others (oneself, SDF members who are at the same
scene as oneself, or those under the supervision of oneself), the so-called “right to use weapons in defense of the mission mandate” allows the use of weapons beyond self-preservation,

Concept of ensuring civilian control of the military

- Response against ballistic missiles requires the government to assess the possibility of missiles fl ying toward Japan by comprehensively analyzing and evaluating the
specifi c situation and international circumstances. In addition to the SDF destroying the missile, interagency actions are required, for example, measures for civil
protection such as alert and evacuation, diplomatic activities, information gathering by related agencies, and enhancement of readiness for emergencies.

**(3) Authority for the Use of Weapons**
In protecting weapons and other equipment described in (1)
above as part of their duties, SDF personnel are permitted to
use weapons to the extent judged to be reasonably necessary
depending on the situation when there are adequate grounds
to recognize the need to use weapons to protect persons,
weapons, and other equipment (however, causing harm to
people is permitted only in cases of legitimate self-protection
or evasion from present danger).


**Chapter**


7 Protection of Weapons and Other Equipment of the
Units of the U.S. Forces and the Armed Forces of Other
Foreign Countries


The newly added provisions, Article 95-2 of the SDF Law,
enable SDF personnel to protect the weapons and other
equipment of the units of the United States Forces and the
armed forces of other foreign countries that are in cooperation
with the SDF and are currently engaged in activities that
contribute to the defense of Japan. In December 2016, the
National Security Council approved “The Implementation
Guidelines for Article 95-2 of the Self-Defense Forces
Law,” which sets out the basic principles of the article and
the Cabinet’s involvement in the operationalization of the
article, etc.

**(1) Coverage**
Weapons, etc. of the units of the United States Forces,
armed forces of other foreign countries and other similar
organizations, that are, in cooperation with the SDF and are,
currently engaged in activities that contribute to the defense
of Japan (including joint exercises but excluding activities
in the scene where the combat activities are actually being
conducted).


See Part III, Chapter 1, Section 2-4-2 (Response to Rescue and
Transport of Japanese Nationals Overseas, etc.)

8 Expansion of the Provision of Supplies and Services to
the U.S. Forces


Regarding the provision of supplies or services to the United
States Armed Forces, the scope of the U.S. Forces and the
scope of supplies covered were expanded as follows with the
revised legislation:


**(1) Scope of the U.S. Forces Covered**
a. The scope extended to the United States Armed Forces that
are on field sites along with the units of the SDF carrying
out the following actions or activities and engaged in


**(2) Procedures, etc.**

activities similar to those of the SDF units:

-  Guarding of facilities and areas of bases, etc. of U.S. Forces
Japan

-  Counter-piracy operations

-  Operations necessary to take measures to destroy ballistic
missiles, etc.

-  Removal and disposal of mines or other explosive hazardous
objects

-  Rescue of Japanese nationals overseas, etc. in emergency
situations in foreign countries

-  Activities to gather information by ships or aircraft about
the movements of the armed forces of foreign countries and
other information that contributes to the defense of Japan

**4** **Disaster Relief Dispatches and Others**

1 Disaster Relief Dispatches


In principle, Disaster Relief Dispatch is conducted as follows:
prefectural governors or other officials ask the Minister of
Defense, or an officer designated by the Minister, to dispatch
the SDF units, etc., in the event of a natural disaster; the
Minister or the designated officer will dispatch the units if it
is deemed necessary for the SDF to respond to the disaster.[27]
This procedure is based on the idea that prefectural governors
and other officials should grasp the overall conditions of the
disaster and their own disaster relief capabilities first, and
then decide whether to make a request for the SDF disaster
relief dispatch.


b. The scope extended to the U.S. Forces participating in
multilateral exercises of three or more countries, including
Japan and the United States, in addition to the U.S. Forces
participating in Japan-U.S. bilateral exercises
c. The scope extended to the U.S. Forces that are in field sites
along with SDF units temporarily staying at facilities of
the U.S. Forces for day-to-day operations, in addition to
the U.S. Forces temporarily staying at SDF facilitie

**(2) Scope of Supplies to be Provided**
Added ammunition (weapons remain excluded)


See Section 3-4 of this Chapter (Conclusion of the New Japan

U.S. Acquisition and Cross-Servicing Agreement (ACSA))


2 Earthquake Prevention Dispatch and Nuclear Disaster
Relief Dispatch


When a warning declaration is issued based on the Act on
Special Measures Concerning Countermeasures for LargeScale Earthquakes[28] or a declaration of a nuclear emergency
situation is issued based on the Act on Special Measures
Concerning Nuclear Emergency Preparedness, the Minister
of Defense is authorized to order dispatching units upon
a request of the Director of the Seismic Disaster Warning
Headquarters or the Director of the Nuclear Disaster
Countermeasures Headquarters (the Prime Minister).

Measures Law,[29] and the Law Concerning Special Measures
on Humanitarian and Reconstruction Assistance in Iraq,[30]
in order to conduct operations such as at-sea replenishment
activities in the Indian Ocean, and humanitarian and
reconstruction support activities in Iraq. However, from the
perspective of enabling seamless responses to any situation,
rather than developing new legislation in response to every
emergence of a specific need in the future, the International
Peace Support Law, enacted as general law, enables Japan
to conduct support operations more expeditiously and
effectively for the military forces of foreign countries
operating for international peace and security, making it
possible to proactively contribute to international peace and
security on Japan’s own initiative.

**(1) Requirements**
The requirement for Japan to offer cooperation and support to
the operations of foreign armed forces is the issuance of one
of the following UN resolutions (by the General Assembly or
the Security Council).
a. Resolutions that decide, call upon, recommend or authorize
the country, which is subject to Japan’s support operations
to respond to situations that threaten the peace and security


of the international community
b. Other than (a), resolutions that regard the situations as a
threat to peace or a breach of peace and call on UN member
states to respond to the situations concerned

**(2) Response Measures**
The following response measures can be implemented in
situations threatening the international peace and security
that the international community is collectively addressing.
**a. Cooperation and Support Activities**
Supplies and services to armed forces of foreign countries
(supply, transportation, repair and maintenance, medical

**KEY WORD**


Situations Threatening the International Peace
and Security that the International Community Is
Collectively Addressing

These refer to situations that threaten peace and security of the international
community, and the international community is collectively addressing the
situations in accordance with the objectives of the UN Charter to remove the
threat; Japan, as a member of the international community, needs to
independently and proactively contribute to these activities


29 The official title of the former Anti-Terrorism Special Measures Act is the “Special Measures Law Concerning Measures Taken by Japan in Support of the Activities of Foreign Countries
Aiming to Achieve the Purposes of the Charter of the United Nations in Response to the Terrorist Attacks Which Took Place on 11 September 2001 in the United States of America as well as
Concerning Humanitarian Measures Based on Relevant Resolutions of the United Nations,” and the official title of the Replenishment Support Special Measures Act is the “Special Measures

While the provision of weapons is not included as in the
Law Concerning Measures to Ensure the Peace and Security
of Japan in Situations that Will Have an Important Influence
on Japan’s Peace and Security, the revised law now allows the
“provision of ammunition” and “refueling and maintenance
of aircraft ready to take off for combat operations.”
**b. Search and Rescue Activities**
**c. Ship Inspection Operations (Those Set Forth in the Ship**
**Inspection Operations Law)**
Ship inspection operations were only permitted to be
performed in situations in areas surrounding Japan.[31]
However, in light of the increased cases of maritime
inspection as countermeasures against global threat such as
the transnational transfer of weapons of mass destruction
and weapons for international terrorism organizations in
the international community since 2000, which is when the
Ship Inspection Operations Act was enacted, the SDF can
carry out ship inspection operations in situations threatening
the international peace and security that the international
community is collectively addressing as defined in the
International Peace Act.

**(3) Measures to Avoid Integration with the Use of Force**
The following measures are set forth in order to avoid
integration with the use of force by a foreign country and
also to ensure the safety of SDF personnel:

-  Japan does not implement support activities in the scene
where a combat is actually taking place. However, when the
personnel having been stranded have already been found
and rescue operations have commenced, the SDF units are
allowed to continue search and rescue activities concerning
them as long as the safety of these units is ensured.

-  The commanding officers of the SDF units, etc., order
a temporary suspension of support activities if combat
operations occur or are expected to occur at the site of their
activities or in the vicinity.

-  The Minister of Defense designates the area for
implementing activities, and if it is deemed difficult to
implement operations smoothly and safely in the whole
or part of that area, must promptly change the designation
of the area or order the cessation of the activities being
implemented there.


**(4) Diet Approval**
Prior Diet approval required without exception, and each
house of the Diet has an obligation to make efforts towards
decisions within 7 days (excluding any period when the Diet
is in recess). In addition, re-approval is required in the case
of a lapse of more than two years since the commencement
of the response measures.

**(5) Authority for the Use of Weapons**
SDF personnel engaged in cooperation support activities
or search and rescue activities in a situation threatening
the international peace and security that the international
community is collectively addressing are permitted the socalled “right to use weapons of self-preservation type.” In
addition, SDF personnel are permitted to use weapons with
members of the armed forces and other organizations of
foreign countries in order to protect the lives and bodies of
those stationed in the camps.


2 International Peace Cooperation Activities


The International Peace Cooperation Act, enacted in 1992,
set forth a framework to operate appropriately and quickly
in the following three operation categories namely UN Peace
Keeping Operations (PKO), International Humanitarian
Relief Operations, and International Election Observation
Operations, and urged the Japanese government to take
measures to provide contributions in kind for those
operations, thereby enabling Japan to actively contribute to
international peace efforts centering upon the UN. The law
also stipulates a set of basic guidelines, or the so-called “Five

Principles for PKO Participation” for Japan’s participation in
these activities.
At the time of the enactment of the Act, it was assumed
that Japan was to cooperate with the ceasefire monitoring in
conventional conflicts between states within the framework
of UN PKO under the control of the UN. However, the
nature of conflicts that the international community faces
has transformed into intra-state conflicts or a combination of
inter-state and intra-state conflicts. Therefore, support for the
nation building of state parties to conflict and the creation of a
safe environment necessary to achieve this end have become
important tasks in international peace cooperation activities.
Furthermore, there is a wide range of international peace
cooperation activities that have come to be implemented
outside of the UN frameworks.[32]


**Chapter**


31 At the time when the Ship Inspection Operations Law was enacted, the conduct of ship inspection operations in situations other than situations in areas surrounding Japan was positioned
as a separate issue on the agenda (an answer given by then Minister for Foreign Affairs Kono at a meeting of the House of Councillors Committee on Foreign Affairs and Defense on
November 28, 2000).

32 These activities include the Aceh Monitoring Mission (AMM), implemented at the request of the European Union, and the Regional Assistance Mission to Solomon Islands (RAMSI),

Given the diversification and qualitative change of the
international peace cooperation activities, through the recent
legal revision, Japan, in order to contribute further to peace
and stability of international community under the policy of
“Proactive Contribution to Peace” based on the principle of
international cooperation, has expanded the scope of tasks that
can be implemented in UN PKO and reviewed the authority
to use weapons, and also introduced new provisions to allow
for active participation in humanitarian and reconstruction
assistance, safety-ensuring, and other non-UN-led operations
(“Internationally Coordinated Operations for Peace and
Security”).

**(1) Requirements for Participation**
**a. UN PKO**
While maintaining the framework of the Five Principles
for Participation, the new law stipulates that the consent
of acceptance of countries to which the areas where these
operations are conducted belong needs to be recognized
as being stably maintained throughout the period of the
operations if the SDF conducts so-called “safety-ensuring”
operations or so-called “kaketsuke-keigo” operations.
**b. Internationally Coordinated Operations for Peace and**
**Security**
Besides the existing three types of operations (UN
PKO, International Humanitarian Relief Operations, and
International Election Observation Operations), Japan is now


is satisfied, in addition to the fulfillment of the Five Principles
for Participation.
1. Based on resolutions of the General Assembly, the Security
Council, or the Economic and Social Council of the UN
2. At the requests of any of the following international
organizations:

-  The UN

-  Organs established by the UN General Assembly or
Specialized Agencies, Funds and Programmes of the
UN such as the Office of the UN High Commissioner
for Refugees or otherwise specified by a Cabinet Order

-  Regional organizations, as prescribed in Article 52 of the
UN Charter or organs established by multilateral treaties,
acknowledged as having the actual achievements or
expertise pertaining to the activities of Internationally
Coordinated Operations for Peace and Security such as
the European Union or otherwise specified by a Cabinet
Order
3. At the requests of the countries to which the areas where
those operations are to be conducted belong (limited to
only those cases that are supported by any of the principal
organs of the UN as prescribed in Article 7 (1) of the UN
Charter).

**(2) Description of Tasks**
In addition to ceasefire monitoring and humanitarian relief
operations for afflicted persons, the following tasks have
been added and expanded to tasks in UN PKO, etc.

-  Addition of monitoring, stationing, patrol, inspections at
checkpoints and security escort for the protection of safety
of specified areas including prevention and suppression of
injury or harm against lives, bodies and property of local
population, afflicted persons and other populations requiring
protection (so-called “safety-ensuring” operations)

-  Addition of protection of lives and bodies of individuals
engaging in international peace cooperation operations
or providing support for those operations, in response to
urgent requests when unexpected dangers to lives or bodies
of such individuals related to operations occur or are
imminent (so-called “kaketsuke-keigo” operations)

-  Expansion of tasks such as provision of advice or guidance
related to works for the purpose of assisting in establishing
or re-establishing organizations of the Government relating
to national defense or other organizations

-  Expansion of tasks conducted at organizations for
supervision and coordination of tasks to include planning,
drafting, coordination or collection and updating of
information in Headquarters Office or coordination offices
conducting UN PKO and Internationally Coordinated
Operations for Peace and Security, for the implementation


**Chapter**


**KEY WORD**


So-called “Five Principles for Participation” in
PKO

(1) Agreements on a ceasefire shall have been reached among the Parties to
Armed Conflict; (2) Consent for the conduct of UN PKO as well as Japan’s
participation in such operations shall have been obtained from the countries
to which the areas where those operations are to be conducted belongs as
well as from the Parties to Armed Conflict; (3) The operations shall strictly
maintain impartiality, and not favor any of the parties to the armed conflict;
(4) Should any of the requirements in the above-mentioned guideline cease
to be satisfied, the International Peace Cooperation Corps may terminate the
International Peace Cooperation Assignments; and (5) The use of weapons
shall be limited to the minimum necessity for the protection of the lives of
personnel dispatched, in principle. Following the latest amendment of the
Act, additional condition, “when the consent for acceptance is deemed to be
consistently maintained, the use of weapons in defense of the mission
mandate is allowed for implementation of so-called ‘safety-ensuring’
operations and the so-called ‘kaketsuke-keigo’ (coming to protection of
individuals related to operations in response to urgent request) operations as
the use of weapons beyond self-preservation and Article 95 of the SDF Law
(the use of force for protection of weapons, etc.)” has been added to (5) of
the Five Principles for Participation.

-----

**(3) Authority to Use Weapons**
**a. Expansion of the Authority to Use Weapons for Self-**
**Preservation (Joint Protection of Camps)**
Camps of UN PKO, etc., are the bases where personnel of
participating countries spend their time when not conducting
operations outside camps, and the last bastion, so to speak,
to secure the safety of lives and bodies of those inside.
Thus, in the case of unexpected situations, such as attacks
against camps, it is essential for SDF personnel stationed
in the camps, even if they are not the direct target of such
attacks, to coordinate with the personnel of other countries
and protect each other and deal with the common danger. In
light of this, the use of weapons for the purpose of protecting
individuals jointly stationed in the camps are allowed as the
use of weapons for self-preservation according to the revised
legislation.[33]

**b. The Authority to Use Weapons in the So-Called “Kaketsuke-**
**Keigo” Operations**
In carrying out so-called “kaketsuke-keigo” operations,
uniformed SDF personnel are permitted to use weapons
to the extent judged reasonably necessary according to
the circumstances, when reasonable grounds are found for
the unavoidable necessity to protect the lives or bodies of
themselves or individuals related to operations that they
intend to protect (however, inflicting injury on a person is
permitted only in the cases of legitimate self-defense or
aversion of clear and present danger).
**c. The Authority to Use Weapons for So-Called “Safety-**
**Ensuring” Operations**
In carrying out so-called “safety-ensuring” operations,
uniformed SDF personnel are permitted to use weapons
within the limits judged reasonably necessary according to
the circumstances, when reasonable grounds are found for
the unavoidable necessity to protect the lives, bodies or
properties of themselves or other individuals, or to eliminate
obstructive behavior for their duties (however, inflicting
injury on a person is permitted only in the cases of legitimate
self-defense or aversion of clear and present danger).


called safety-ensuring operations, in addition to ceasefire
monitoring, in principle (ex-post facto approval is permitted
when the Diet is in recess or the House of Representatives is
dissolved).

**(5) Ensuring the Safety of SDF Personnel**
The provision for ensuring the safety of the personnel of
the International Peace Cooperation Corps was added,
while the measures for ensuring the safety of the personnel
were incorporated into the matters to be stipulated in the
Implementation Procedures.


**(6) Other Key Points of Amendment**

-  Dispatch of uniformed SDF personnel to the UN (dispatch
of Force Commanders of UN PKO)
The Act was amended to make it possible to dispatch
uniformed SDF personnel and have them engage in the tasks
of the UN and those concerning overall management of tasks
implemented by units of the SDF, etc., or units of armed
forces of foreign states participating in UN PKO, at the
request of the UN, with the consent of the Prime Minister.[34]

-  Provision of supplies and services to the Armed Forces of
the United States, etc., for their operations to cope with
large-scale disaster[35]

The Act was amended to make it possible for the SDF to
provide the U.S. Forces or the Australian Defence Force with
supplies or services when they request the provision and are
located in the area together with the units of the SDF, etc., and
is undertaking operations to cope with large-scale disasters,
so far as it does not hinder the performance of International
Peace Cooperation Assignments, etc., of the SDF.[36]

3 International Disaster Relief Operations


When large-scale disasters occur in regions overseas,
especially in less-developed regions, and the governments of
the affected countries or international organizations request
assistance, the Minister of Foreign Affairs shall consult with
the chief of relevant administrative agencies including the
Ministry of Defense as well as the National Public Safety
Commission regarding the details of such request if dispatch
is deemed appropriate.
Following such consultation, the Ministry of Foreign

33 The authority to use weapons for self-preservation is allowed in view of the existence of particular circumstances, whereby armed personnel, who protect camps which are the last
bastions of safety, are in the relationship of mutually dependent upon each other in dealing with situations.

34 The dispatch of uniformed SDF personnel is limited to cases where the consent of the countries hosting the UN PKO for which the dispatched uniformed SDF personnel will conduct
operations and of state parties to the conflict regarding the implementation of the UN PKO (when the state parties to the conflict are nonexistent, the consent of the countries where the UN
PKO is to be conducted) is deemed to be stably maintained throughout the duration of the dispatch and where circumstances that lead to the suspension of the dispatch are deemed

2 Establishment of Provisions for the Punishment of
Those who Commit Crimes Overseas


Since the duties of the SDF overseas are to be expanded under
the latest legal revisions, it is necessary to more adequately
ensure the discipline and control of the activities of the SDF
overseas.
For this reason, provisions were established for the
punishment of those who commit crimes overseas such as
the following: (1) Colluded defiance of superiors’ official
orders and unlawful command of units, and (2) defiance of
and disobedience to superiors’ orders by those given defense
operation orders.

**Duties of the Self Defense Forces**

The Ministry of Defense and Self Defense Forces are national administrative entities and obviously require a legal basis in
carrying out their respective duties. The Act for Establishment of the Ministry of Defense defines the administrative scope
of the Ministry of Defense, and Article 5 of the Act states that the Self Defense Forces Law determines the duties, actions,
and authority of the Self Defense Forces. The Self Defense Forces Law provides a list (similar to an index) of what the Self
Defense Forces are allowed to do in accordance with specified procedures to address various situations.
Article 3 in the Self Defense Forces Law divides the duties of the Self Defense Forces into main duties (item 1 of the
same article) and secondary duties (items 1 and 2 of the same article). Defense actions to defend Japan correspond to main
duties, and only the Self Defense Forces carry out these duties.
Secondary duties consist of “duties for maintaining public order as necessary” (secondary duties under item 1) and
duties defined by other laws “to an extent that does not interfere with performance of the main duties” (secondary duties
under item 2). The former includes public order actions that police entities cannot handle alone, maritime guarding actions,
measures to destroy ballistic missiles and other weapons, and measures to deal with airspace intrusions. The latter covers
actions conducted in response to important impact situations (logistical assistance), international peace cooperation
activities (international peace cooperation operations and international disaster relief operations), and activities related to
international peace joint action situations (cooperative assistance, etc.). These main and secondary duties are jointly known
as “inherent duties.”
Activities handled by the Self Defense Forces on the basis that it is appropriate to utilize skills, experience, and
organizational functions cultivated by the Self Defense Forces over many years are known as “additional duties” (separate
from inherent duties). These include transportation for national guests, education and training consignments, and cooperation
with athletic events.

From July to August 2017, the SDF participated in
multilateral exercise Khaan Quest 17 to improve various
capabilities through conducting exercises on the UN PKO
based on the International Peace Cooperation Act. In
June 2018, moreover, the SDF participated in multilateral
exercise Khaan Quest 18 and conducted training related to
the “joint protection of camps” and so-called “kaketsukekeigo” (coming to the aid of a geographically distant unit
or personnel under attack) as well as “safety-ensuring
operations” based on the International Peace Cooperation
Act. Also in June 2019, the SDF participated in multilateral
exercise Khaan Quest 19 and conducted training related to
“kaketsuke-keigo” and “safety-ensuring operations.”
In September 2018 in Djibouti, and in Japan in December,
the SDF conducted a training on rescue of Japanese nationals
overseas provided in SDF Law Article 84-3 to improve its
joint operation capabilities and to strengthen cooperation
with the relevant organizations.
Between January and February 2019, the SDF participated
in multilateral exercise Cobra Gold 19 and conducted training
on rescue of Japanese nationals overseas to improve its
joint operation capabilities. In Staff Exercise, the SDF also
conducted activities including training on cooperation and
support activities under the International Peace Support Act.

1 Promotion of Various Preparations


Since the enforcement of the Legislation for Peace and
Security on March 29, 2016, the MOD/SDF has undertaken
various preparations for a variety of new missions based on
the Legislation for Peace and Security, such as activities to
raise awareness of legal systems and intra-unit rules that
were established, education of SDF personnel, as well as
development of educational materials necessary for the actual
training of various units and the nurturing of instructors. In
August 2016, as these preparations were all but completed,
each unit of the SDF sets out to implement necessary training
in connection with the Legislation for Peace and Security.
Between Japan and the United States, and other bilateral and
multilateral joint training, Japan started to conduct necessary
training related to the Legislation for Peace and Security
after coordinating with the countries concerned.

2 Training and Exercises


In July 2017, the SDF conducted the first exercise on the
protection of U.S. vessels based on SDF Law Article 95-2
with the intention to enhance the relationship with the U.S.
Navy.


**Chapter**


In April 2019, Japan decided to dispatch personnel to the
MFO headquarters, which conducts activities, such as
monitoring of the ceasefire between Egypt and Israel in the
Sinai Peninsula.
In making this decision, in accordance with the
International Peace Cooperation Act, careful study was made
on whether the MFO’s activities satisfied the Five Principles
for Participation and whether the activities constituted
Internationally Coordinated Operations for Peace and
Security under the Act on Cooperation with United Nations
Peacekeeping Operations and Other Operations. As a result,
since the MFO’s activities were determined to satisfy the Five
Principles for Participation and constitute Internationally
Coordinated Operations for Peace and Security, the dispatch
of personnel was decided.

etc. and that the SDF personnel never respond to any combat
activities by the use of weapons pursuant to the Article.
The SDF personnel thus never conduct use of force and this
prevents the situation from evolving into combat activities
as a result of the use of weapons under the provision of the
Article.
This use of weapons does not fall under “use of force”
which is banned in Article 9 of the Constitution.
**b. Activities that Contribute to the Defense of Japan**
“Activities that contribute to the defense of Japan” in the
Article may include mainly the following ones, while
the Government of Japan is to examine each activity on
a case-by-case basis: (1) intelligence, surveillance, and
reconnaissance (ISR) activities including ballistic missile
alert; (2) transportation and replenishment activities in
“situations that will have an important influence”; and (3)
joint exercises to enhance capabilities required for defending
Japan
**c. Judgment on Whether or Not to Conduct Asset Protection**
When the Minister of Defense receives a request from the
U.S. Forces, etc., the Minister subjectively should judge
whether the activities conducted by the units of the U.S.
Forces, etc. in cooperation with the SDF are “activities
that contribute to the defense of Japan” and whether asset
protection by the SDF personnel is necessary, by considering
the objective and content of the activities, capability of the
unit, types of weapons, etc. of the unit and surrounding
circumstances including possibility of combat activity as
well as the impacts on performance of the SDF’s regular
operations.

**(2) Involvement of the Cabinet**
Requests from the U.S. Forces, etc. based on Paragraph 2
of the Article should be deliberated in the National Security
Council (NSC) before the Minister of Defense judges on
conducting asset protection if the Minister receives requests
in the following cases. However, in case there is no time
for dealing with an urgent request by the U.S. Forces, etc.,
the Minister should promptly report to the NSC regarding
judgment of providing asset protection.
(1) The U.S. Forces, etc. makes a request for the first
time after the operationalization of asset protection. (2) The
request is made for asset protection in the territory of a third
country.
(3) The request is recognized as peculiarly important,
although not falling under the above two categories. In
addition, in case asset protection under the situations that


1 Background


Since the enactment of the Legislation for Peace and
Security, the MOD/SDF have been explaining to and
coordinating with the United States and also engaged in the
work to develop necessary rules and regulations in order to
ensure appropriate operation of the system for the protection
of weapons, etc., of the units of the U.S. Forces and the
armed forces of other foreign countries (SDF Law Article
95-2). Upon completion of these works, in December 2016,
at the National Security Council the Government decided on
the Implementation Guidelines concerning Article 95-2 of
the SDF Law, and the Article became ready to be applied to
the U.S. Forces operations. This operationalization helps to
further strengthen coordinated surveillance between the SDF
and the U.S. Forces and also to further enhance deterrence
and response capabilities of the Japan-U.S. Alliance.

2 The Implementation Guidelines for Article 95-2 of the
SDF Law


The Implementation Guidelines for Article 95-2 of the SDF
Law set forth the Government’s basic understanding on the
article as well as basic principles on the involvement of the
Cabinet and disclosure of information in implementing the
article. An outline of the guidelines is as follows:


**Chapter**


**(1) Basic Principles of Implementing Article 95-2**

**a. Purpose of Article 95-2**
This Article is to enable SDF personnel to carry out very
passive and limited use of weapons to the minimum extent
necessary to protect weapons and other equipment (“the
weapons, etc.”) of units of the U.S. Forces, armed forces
of other countries or other similar organizations (“the U.S.
Forces, etc.”), that are concurrently engaged in activities that
contribute to the defense of Japan (including joint exercises
but excluding activities conducted in places where combat
activities are actually occurring) in cooperation with the SDF,
from infringements which do not amount to an armed attack,
because the weapons, etc. can be regarded as an important
material means which constitute the defense capability of
Japan.
Through the provision of Paragraph 1 of the Article that
“excluding activities conducted in places where combat
activities are actually occurring,” it is ensured that asset
protection is not to be, nor to be legally regarded as being
integrated (“ittaika”) with the use of force of the U.S. Forces,

Minister should clearly state it in the Basic Plan and should
ask for a Cabinet decision on it after deliberations in the
NSC. (*) “Situations that will have an important influence”
is provided in Article 1 of the Law Concerning Measures to
Ensure Peace and Security of Japan in Situations that Will
Have an Important Influence on Japan’s Peace and Security,
Act No. 11 of 1999. The National Security Council Board
is to be held flexibly and support the full National Security
Council. In addition, the relevant ministries and agencies are
to share information on requests for protection and closely
cooperate with each other.

**(3) Disclosure of Information**
In the implementation of Article 95-2, if an unusual
event occurs in conducting asset protection operation,
the Government promptly discloses such an event, and
releases a basic plan that specifies matters concerning the


implementation of asset protection operations in a situation
that will have an important influence on Japan’s peace
and security. The Government also strives for appropriate
disclosure of information in light of the Act on Access to
Information Held by Administrative Organs (Act No. 42 of
1999).

3 3 Track Record of Asset Protection Operations in 2018


In 2018, during ISR activities including ballistic missile alert,
SDF vessels conducted asset protection for U.S. military
vessels three times, and during joint exercises, SDF vessels
conducted asset protection for U.S. military vessels three
times and SDF aircraft for U.S. military aircraft ten times,
totaling 16 times.

**Japan’s Own Architecture for National Defense**
### 1


The National Defense Program Guidelines for FY2019 and
beyond (NDPG)[1] reflects the recognition that Japan, even
amid the realities of security environment it has hitherto never
faced, must strive to preserve national interests identified in
the National Security Strategy—defend to the end Japanese
nationals’ life, person and property, territorial land, waters
and airspace, and its sovereignty and independence. Based
on that recognition, the NDPG identifies national defense
objectives and the means to achieve them.
To this end, the NDPG defines national defense objectives
as follows: first, to create, on a steady-state basis, security
environment desirable for Japan by integrating and drawing
on the strengths at the nation’s disposal; second, to deter

**Section**
**1** **Truly Effective Defense Capability**


As described below, concerning the strengthening of Japan’s
own architecture for national defense, the NDPG identifies
the significance and necessity of defense capacity, and states


threat from reaching Japan by making opponent realize that
doing harm to Japan would be difficult and consequential;
and finally, should threat reach Japan, to squarely counter the
threat and minimize damage.
Furthermore, the NDPG provides that Japan will
strengthen each of the means by which to successfully
achieve these national defense objectives: Japan’s own
architecture for national defense; the Japan-U.S. Alliance;
and international security cooperation, which are three pillars
of Japan’s defense.
Part III explains initiatives by the Ministry of Defense
(MOD) and the Self-Defense Forces (SDF) based on these
three pillars of Japan’s defense.

that Japan will build a truly effective defense capability,
“Multi-Domain Defense Force.”


**Chapter**


**1** **Signifi cance and Necessity of Defense Capability**


Defense capability is the ultimate guarantor of Japan’s
national security. Defense capability represents Japan’s will
and ability to: deter threat from reaching Japan; and should
threat reach Japan, eliminate the threat and, as a sovereign
nation, by exerting efforts on its own accord and initiative,
defend to the end Japanese nationals’ life, person and property
as well as territorial land, waters and airspace.
At the same time, defense capability is essential for Japan
to play on its initiative its roles in the Japan-U.S. Alliance
at all phases from peacetime to armed contingencies.

**2** **Truly Effective Defense Capability—Multi-domain Defense Force**


To be able to deter and counter qualitatively and quantitatively
superior military threats in increasingly testing security
environment, it has become vitally important to adapt to
warfare that combines capabilities in new domains–space,


Strengthening Japan’s defense capability to provide for
national security is none other than strengthening the
Japan-U.S. Alliance. Defense capability is essential also for
advancing Japan’s efforts in security cooperation with other
countries.
Defense capability is the most important strength for
Japan in retaining self-sustained existence as a sovereign
nation amid security environment it has never faced before.
Japan must strengthen this capability on its own accord and
initiative.

domains–land, sea and air.
Japan needs to develop, while qualitatively and
quantitatively enhancing capabilities in individual domains, a

defense capability that can execute cross-domain operations,
which organically fuse capabilities in all domains to generate
synergy and amplify the overall strength, so that even when
inferiority exists in individual domains, such inferiority will
be overcome and national defense accomplished.
In order to ensure national defense in increasingly uncertain
security environment, it is also important for Japan to be able
to seamlessly conduct activities at all stages from peacetime
to armed contingencies. To date, Japan has endeavored to
develop a defense capability that allows to engage in diverse
activities in a swift and sustainable manner. In recent years,
however, the SDF has had to increase the scope and frequency
of its steady state activities such as maintaining presence,
as well as intelligence, surveillance and reconnaissance
(ISR) activities: This is exacting a chronic burden on its
personnel and equipment, generating a concern that the SDF
may not be able to maintain proficiency and the volume of
its activities. Japan needs to: improve quality and quantity

**Section**
**2** **Role that Japan’s Defense Forces Have to Fulfill**


The NDPG states that, in order to create a security environment
desirable for Japan and to deter and counter threats, Japan’s
defense capability must be able to serve the following roles
in a seamless and combined manner: (1) response from
peacetime to “gray-zone” situations; (2) countering attacks
against Japan, including its remote islands; (3) response
in space, cyberspace and electromagnetic domains during
all phases; (4) response to large-scale disasters, etc.; (5)
cooperation with the United States based on the Japan-U.S.


of capabilities that support sustainability and resiliency of
various activities; and develop a defense capability that
enables sustained conduct of flexible and strategic activities
commensurate with the character of given situations.
Further, Japan’s defense capability needs to be capable of
strengthening the ability of the Japan-U.S. Alliance to deter
and counter threats as well as promoting multi-faceted and
multi-layered security cooperation.
In light of the foregoing, Japan will henceforth build a
truly effective defense capability, “Multi-Domain Defense
Force,” which: organically fuses capabilities in all domains
including space, cyberspace and electromagnetic spectrum;
and is capable of sustained conduct of flexible and strategic
activities during all phases from peacetime to armed
contingencies. The development of “Multi-Domain Defense
Force” will be done while honing the attributes of “Dynamic
Joint Defense Force” under the 2013 NDPG.[2]

Alliance; and (6) promotion of security cooperation.
In particular, in view of protecting the lives and peaceful
livelihoods of Japanese nationals, it is all the more important
for Japan’s defense capability to fulfill diverse roles on a
steady-state basis.


**Chapter**


See Reference 15 (Main Operations of the Self-Defense Forces);
Reference 16 (Statutory Provisions about Use of Force and
Use of Weapons by SDF Personnel or SDF Units)


**1** **Response from Peacetime to Grey Zone Situations**


Among the roles that must be served by Japan’s defense
capability as set forth in the NDPG, the idea of “(1) response
from peacetime to ‘gray-zone’ situations” is as follows.
The SDF will enhance its presence on a steady-state basis
by actively engaging in, among others, joint training and
exercises and overseas port visits, thereby demonstrating
Japan’s will and capability. The SDF will, in close integration
with diplomacy, promote strategic communications,
including the aforementioned activities by SDF units.
The SDF will leverage its capabilities in all domains to
conduct wide-area, persistent intelligence, surveillance and
reconnaissance (hereinafter referred to as “persistent ISR”)
activities around Japan. The SDF will prevent the occurrence
or escalation of emergencies by employing flexible deterrent

2 S P t II Ch t 3 S ti 1 F t t 7


options and other measures. Leveraging posture in place for
these activities, the SDF will, in coordination with the police
and other agencies, immediately take appropriate measures
in response to actions that violate Japan’s sovereignty,
including incursions into its territorial airspace and waters.
The SDF will provide persistent protection against
incoming ballistic missiles and other threats, and minimize
damage should it occur.
Initiatives carried out based on this role are explained
below.

Minamikojima Island, and Kitakojima Island), Chinese
government vessels carried out intermittent intrusions into
Japan’s territorial waters surrounding the Senkaku Islands.[3] In
June 2016, a Chinese Navy combatant vessel entered Japan’s
contiguous zone to the north of the Senkaku Islands for the
first time. Chinese Navy vessels continue their activities in
the sea areas surrounding Japan, and six vessels including the
Kuznetsov-class aircraft carrier “Liaoning” passed through the
sea area between the main island of Okinawa and Miyakojima
Island, and entered the western Pacific in December 2016.
This was the first time that the entry of this aircraft carrier into
the Pacific Ocean was confirmed.[4] In July 2017, a Chinese
naval intelligence collection ship entered Japanese territorial
waters southwest of Kojima (Matsumae, Hokkaido) passing
east through the Tsugaru Strait to the Pacific Ocean for the
first time. In January 2018, the SDF confirmed that a Chinese
submarine and warship had been navigating through the
Japanese contiguous waters of the Senkaku Islands on the
same day. Furthermore, in April, in waters some 350 km
south of Yonaguni Island, a number of (presumed) fighter jets
were observed taking off from the aircraft carrier Liaoning
for the first time. Also in June 2019, the SDF confirmed that
six vessels, including the aircraft carrier “Liaoning,” passed
through the sea area between the main island of Okinawa and
Miyako Island, and entered the Pacific.
It has been pointed out that North Korea is attempting
to evade United Nations (UN) Security Council sanctions
through smuggling. As part of its regular warning and
surveillance activities in Japanese territorial waters, the SDF
is carrying out information gathering on vessels suspected
of violating the UN Security Council sanctions. During the
period from 2018 to the end of June 2019, SDF patrol aircraft
have confirmed 20 observations[5] of seaborne rendezvous
between North Korean tankers and foreign-flagged tankers
in the East China Sea. The information was shared with


1 Persistent ISR in the Area Surrounding Japan


**(1) Basic Concept**
Japan is comprised of a little over 6,800 islands, and is
surrounded by wide sea space, which includes the sixth
largest[1] territorial waters (including inland waters) and
Exclusive Economic Zone (EEZ) in the world. The SDF is
engaged in persistent intelligence collection and warning and
surveillance during peacetime over Japan’s territorial waters
and airspace, as well as the surrounding sea and airspace so
that it can respond to various contingencies immediately and
seamlessly.

**(2) Response by the MOD/SDF**
The Maritime Self-Defense Force (MSDF) patrols the areas
such as the waters surrounding Hokkaido, the Sea of Japan,
and the East China Sea from peacetime, using patrol aircraft
and other aircraft. The Air Self-Defense Force (ASDF) uses
radar sites at 28 locations nationwide, and early warning
and control aircraft amongst others, to carry out warning
and surveillance activities over Japan and its surrounding
airspace. These activities of the MSDF and ASDF are
done 24 hours a day. Warning and surveillance activities
in major channels are also conducted 24 hours a day by
MSDF guard posts, Ground Self-Defense Force (GSDF)
coastal surveillance units, and other assets.[2] Furthermore,
warning and surveillance activities are carried out with the
flexible use of destroyers, aircraft, and so on as required. The
information obtained through such surveillance activities is
shared with the relevant ministries and agencies, including
the Japan Coast Guard, in order to strengthen coordination.
To show an example of the events that were reported
from SDF’s surveillance, following September 2012 when
the Government of Japan acquired property rights to and
ownership of three of the Senkaku Islands (Uotsuri Island,


Excluding overseas territories. The EEZ is the eighth largest in the world if overseas territories are included.

Article 4(1)18 of the Act for Establishment of the MOD (Investigation and research required for the performance of duties within jurisdiction) provides the legal basis for early warning
surveillance activities by the SDF.

Since December 26, 2015, Chinese government vessels equipped with weapons, which appear to be machine guns, have intruded into the territorial waters of Japan.

Activity associated with the passage of Chinese naval vessels through the Ryukyu Islands between the main island of Okinawa and Miyakojima Island was confirmed 15 times in 2018.

relevant agencies and ministries. In a comprehensive
judgment across the government, the vessels concerned are
strongly suspected of engaging in ship-to-ship transfers with
the North Korean vessels, which is prohibited by UN Security
Council resolution. Japan reported this to the UN Security
Council Sanctions Committee on North Korea, shared the
information with relevant countries, gave information to the
relevant countries regarding the tankers concerned and made
public announcements on the subject.
In response to these illicit maritime activities including
transshipments with North Korean vessels prohibited under
the UN Security Council resolution, the United States and
other concerned countries are carrying out early warning
surveillance activities using aircraft based at the United
States Kadena Air Base in Japan.[6] Australian, Canadian,
New Zealand and French aircraft made patrol flights over a
one-month period starting late April 2018. In addition, naval
vessels of the U.S. Marine Corps, the United Kingdom,
Canada,[7] Australia and France carried out early warning
surveillance activities[8] in sea areas surrounding Japan.
The MOD/SDF intend to continue their close cooperation
with concerned countries to ensure compliance with the UN
Security Council resolution.
In December 2018, Gwanggaeto, the Great class destroyer
of the Republic of Korea (ROK) Navy, directed a fire
control-radar at a MSDF patrol aircraft conducting warning
and surveillance activities off the coast of Noto Peninsula
(within Japan’s exclusive economic zone).[9] Taking the
incident seriously, in January 2019, the MOD published
its final statement,[10] compiling objective facts, and has
been urging the Korean side to take recurrence prevention
measures. The SDF patrol aircraft was flying while keeping
sufficient altitude and distance, and did not fly in a way that
could have threatened the Korean navy vessel. The MOD
will expend all possible means to monitor the situation and
gather intelligence.

Reference 17 MOD’s Final statement regarding the incident
of an ROK naval vessel directing its fi re-control radar at an
MSDF patrol aircraft


6 Australia and Canada conducted early warning surveillance activities using aircraft based at the United States Kadena Air Base in Japan for about one year from late April 2018, followed by
Australia, Canada and New Zealand for about one and half months from mid-September of the same year, Australia for about a week from early December of 2018, France for about three
weeks from March 2019, and Australia for about a month from May 2019. In addition, Canada has been conducting early warning surveillance activities using aircraft since early June
2019 (as of the end of June 2019).

7 At the Japan-Canada Summit Meeting held on April 28, 2019, Justin Trudeau, Prime Minister of Canada, indicated that Canada will extend the period for dispatch of aircraft and vessels for
conducting warning and surveillance activities against ship-to-ship transfers of cargo by two years, and Prime Minister Shinzo Abe expressed his gratitude.

8 A number of vessels of the U.S. Navy, the United Kingdom’s naval frigate HMS Sutherland, Argyle and Montrose and a landing ship Albion, Canadian Navy’s frigate Calgary, Australian Navy’s
frigate Melbourne and French Navy’s frigate Vendémiaire conducted early warning surveillance activities in the waters around Japan, including East China Sea. In addition, Canadian Navy’s
frigate Regina and its supply ship Asterix have been conducting early warning surveillance activities in the waters around Japan, including the East China Sea since mid-June 2019 (as of
the end of June).

9 Upon analysis by the MOD of the radar waves directed at the MSDF P-1, the MOD has confi rmed that the P-1 was continuously irradiated for a certain period, multiple times, by the fi recontrol radar of the ROK destroyer. After being irradiated by the fi re-control radar, the MSDF P-1 patrol aircraft called out using three different frequencies, but there was no response at all
from the ROK destroyer. In addition, according to the Code for Unplanned Encounters at Sea (CUES), a code adopted in 2014 by navies and self defence force from 21
countries including Japan and the ROK, aiming fi re control radars is considered a simulation of attack, and is stipulated as an action a commander should avoid.

public order. Unlike measures taken on land or at sea, this
measure can be taken only by the SDF. Therefore, the ASDF
is primarily responsible for conducting the actions based on
Article 84 of the SDF Law.
**b. Response by the MOD/SDF**
The ASDF detects and identifies aircraft flying in airspace
surrounding Japan using warning and control radars as
well as early warning and control aircraft. If any suspicious
aircraft heading to Japan’s territorial airspace are detected,
fighters and other aircraft scramble to approach them in order
to confirm the situation and monitor the aircraft as necessary.
Furthermore, in the event that this suspicious aircraft has
actually intruded into territorial airspace, a warning to leave
the airspace would be issued, among other responses.
In FY2018, ASDF aircraft scrambled 999 times, which
was an increase by 95 times compared with the previous
fiscal year. This is the 2nd highest number of times since
1958, when scrambles commenced and the number continues
to be kept relatively high.
Breaking this figure down, planes were scrambled 638
times in response to Chinese aircraft. Chinese aircraft
continue to be highly active, as this is the 2nd highest figure
since the number of scrambles by country and region was

2 Measures against Violation of Japan’s Sovereignty


**(1) Warnings and Emergency Takeoffs (Scrambles) in**
**Preparation against Intrusion of Territorial Airspace**

**a. Basic Concept**
Under international law, countries have complete and
exclusive sovereignty over their airspace. Scrambling against
aircraft intruding into territorial airspace is conducted as an
act to exercise the right of policing intended to maintain


-----

**Chapter**


An ASDF pilot running up to an F-15 fi ghter aircraft
on receiving an order to scramble

As a distinctive example, in September 2018, a Su-35 fighter
jet was for the first time recognized over the Sea of Japan. In
June 2019, two Tu-95 long range bombers intruded into Japan’s
airspace above the territorial waters of Minamidaitojima
Island (Okinawa Prefecture). One of them further intruded into
Japan’s airspace above the territorial waters of Hachijojima
Island (Tokyo). Japan lodged protests against the Russian
government through diplomatic channels. Due attention needs
to be paid to the activities of Russian aircraft.
In July 2019, two Chinese H-6 bombers and two Russian
Tu-95 long-range bombers carried out long distance
joint flights from the Sea of Japan to the East China Sea.
In addition, one Russian A-50 early warning and control
aircraft allegedly supporting Tu-95 long-range bombers
intruded into Japan’s airspace above the territorial waters of
Takeshima Island in Shimane Prefecture. A Korean fighter
fired warning shots to the Russian aircraft. Japan lodged
protests against the Russian government which intruded
into Japan’s airspace and against the Korean government
which fired warning shots to the Russian aircraft through


Russian Tu-95 long range bombers intruding into Japan’s airspace

first made public in 2001.
A distinctive example arose in May 2017 when a drone
caused an airspace violation as it flew above a Chinese
naval vessel entering Japanese territorial waters near the
Senkaku Islands. Japan lodged protests against the Chinese
government through diplomatic channels. In August that
year, six Chinese military bombers were observed in an
unprecedented flight from the East China Sea over the main
island of Okinawa and Miyakojima Island northeast across
the Pacific to an area off the Kii Peninsula before returning.
Then in December, five aircraft including two fighter jets
flew over the Tsushima Strait and entered the Japan Sea
airspace.[11] Then in April 2018, a (presumed) unmanned
Chinese aircraft flew across the East China Sea.
With these kinds of acts, China is expanding and
intensifying the activities of its air force inside Japanese
airspace and one-sidedly escalating its actions in some cases.
It is a troubling situation.
Planes were scrambled 343 times in response to Russian
aircraft, a decrease of 47 events compared to the year before.

**(2) Response to Submarines Submerged in Japan’s Territorial**
**Waters**

**a. Basic Concept**
With respect to foreign submarines navigating underwater
in Japan’s territorial waters,[12] an order for maritime security
operations will be issued. The submarine will be requested
to navigate on the surface of the water and show its flag, in
accordance with international law, and in the event that the
submarine does not comply with the request, the SDF will
request it to leave Japanese territorial waters.

See Part II, Chapter 5, Section 2-3-2 (Maritime Security
Operations)

**b. Response by the MOD/SDF**
The MSDF is maintaining and enhancing capabilities
for: expressing its intention not to permit any navigation
that violates international law; and responding in shallow
water areas by detecting, identifying, and tracking foreign
submarines navigating under the territorial waters of Japan.
In November 2004, the MSDF observed a submerged
Chinese nuclear-powered submarine navigating under
Japanese territorial waters around the Sakishima Islands.
In response to this incident, the MSDF issued an order for
maritime security operations, and continued to track the

diplomatic channel.
Even after the establishment of the “East China Sea Air
Defense Identification Zone” by China in November 2013,
the MOD/SDF has implemented warning and surveillance
activities as before in the East China Sea, including the
zone in question, and has continued to take all initiatives
necessary to engage in warning and surveillance in both the
sea and airspace around Japan. The MOD/SDF also engages
in strict airspace antiintrusion measures in accordance with
international law and the SDF Law.

submarine with MSDF vessels until it entered the high seas.
MSDF P-3C patrol aircraft and others also confirmed
observation of submerged submarines navigating through
the Japanese contiguous zones in May 2013 in waters south
of Kumejima Island, in March 2014 off the east coast of
Miyakojima Island and in February 2016 in waters southeast
of Tsushima Island. Further, in January 2018, a submerged
submarine was spotted by MSDF assets including a destroyer
moving through Japanese contiguous zones of the Senkaku
Islands. The submarine was then observed surfacing in
international waters of the East China Sea flying the Chinese
flag. This was the first time that a Chinese naval submarine
has been observed operating in the Japanese contiguous
zones of the Senkaku Islands. Although international law
does not forbid foreign submarines navigating underwater
in the contiguous zone of coastal states, Japan maintains a
posture to appropriately deal with such activities.

**(3) Response to Armed Special Operations Vessels**
**a. Basic Concept**
The Japan Coast Guard, as a police organization, is primarily
responsible for responding to suspicious armed special
operations vessels (unidentified vessels). However, in the
event that it is deemed extremely difficult or impossible for
the Japan Coast Guard to respond to a situation, an order for
maritime security operations will be issued and the situation
will be handled by the SDF in cooperation with the Japan
Coast Guard.
**b. Response by the MOD/SDF**
In light of the lessons learned from the cases of an unidentified
vessel off the Noto Peninsula in 1999, an unidentified vessel
in the sea southwest of Kyushu in 2001, and other similar
incidents, the MOD/SDF have been making various efforts.
In particular, the MSDF has been taking the following
steps: (1) deployment of Patrol Guided Missile Boats; (2)
establishment of the MSDF Special Boarding Unit;[13] (3)
equipment of destroyers with machine guns; (4) furnishing
forcible maritime interdiction equipment (flat-nose shells);[14]
(5) improving the sufficiency ratio of military vessel
personnel; and (6) enhancing equipment for the Vessel
Boarding Inspection Team.


The National Security Strategy (NSS) states that as a
maritime state, Japan will play a leading role, in maintaining
and developing “Open and Stable Sea,” which are upheld by
maritime order based upon such fundamental principles as the
rule of law, ensuring the freedom and safety of navigation and
overflight, and peaceful settlement of disputes in accordance
with relevant international law, rather than by force.
The third Basic Plan on Ocean Policy[15] was given Cabinet
approval in May 2018. Taking a broad view of ocean policy
from the perspective of security on the ocean, the Plan
states that the government will act as one in undertaking
“comprehensive maritime security.”
For this purpose, the government will undertake securing
of the national interest in the territorial water of Japan and
stable use of its important sea lanes.
Furthermore, the government will further strengthen its
efforts toward enhancement of Maritime Domain Awareness
(MDA) that collects and summarize a variety of maritime
information from ships, aircraft, etc. in order to use the
information for measures regarding the sea.

**(2) Initiatives of the MOD/SDF**
In order to maintain the order of “Open and Stable Seas” and
contribute to comprehensive maritime security, the MOD/
SDF is enhancing warning and surveillance activities on
important remote islands and their surrounding sea areas and
conducting counter-piracy operations to secure stable use of
sea lanes.
Within the framework of the Western Pacific Naval
Symposium (WPNS), the MSDF has been engaged in
initiatives such as cooperation in the establishment of
the Code for Unplanned Encounters at Sea (CUES).[16]
In September 2018, three MSDF destroyers, including
Destroyer JS “Kaga,” five carrier aircraft, and submarine
“Kuroshio” conducted an anti-submarine warfare exercise in
the South China Sea.
At the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN)
Defence Ministers’ Meeting-Plus (ADMM-Plus) in October
2018, Minister of Defense Iwaya raised an objection to
attempts to unilaterally change the status quo by force in the
Indo Pacific and spoke of the importance of consolidating
order based on the principles of international law.

See Chapter 3, Section 2 (Ensuring Maritime Security)


3 Initiatives towards Ensuring Maritime Security


**(1) Basic Approach by the Government**

security operations.

**2** **Defense of Japan including its Remote Islands**


Among the roles that must be served by Japan’s defense
capability as set forth in the NDPG, the idea of “(2) countering
attacks against Japan, including its remote islands” is as
follows.
In response to attack on Japan including its remote islands,
the SDF will quickly maneuver and deploy requisite units to
block access and landing of invading forces while ensuring
maritime[17] and air[18] superiority. Even when maintaining
maritime and air superiority becomes untenable, the SDF
will block invading forces’ access and landing from outside
their threat envelopes. Should any part of the territory be
occupied, the SDF will retake it by employing all necessary
measures.
Against airborne attack by missiles and aircraft, the SDF
will respond in a swift and sustained manner by applying
optimal means and minimize damage to maintain SDF’s
capabilities as well as the infrastructure upon which such
capabilities are employed.
In response to attack by guerrillas or special operations
forces, the SDF will protect critical facilities including nuclear
power plants and search and destroy infiltrating forces.
In responding to such attacks, the SDF will implement
cross-domain operations that organically fuse capabilities in
space, cyberspace and electromagnetic domains to block and
eliminate attacks.
In view of protecting the life, person and property of
the nationals, the SDF will implement measures for civil
protection.
Initiatives carried out based on this role are explained
below.

1 Defense of Japan’s Remote Islands


**(1) Basic Concept**
Japan possesses numerous remote islands. In order to respond
to attacks on these islands, it is important to station units and
so forth in accordance with the security environment, and
also to maneuver and deploy them according to situations on
a steady-state basis. It is also important to ensure maritime
and air superiority by detecting signs at an early stage through
persistent intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance
(ISR) conducted by the SDF.
If signs of attack are detected in advance, troops will be


maneuvered and deployed in an area expected to be invaded
ahead of the deployment of enemy units, and block access
and landing of invading forces. Even when maintaining
maritime and air superiority becomes untenable, the SDF
will block invading forces’ access and landing from outside
their threat envelopes.
Should any part of the territory be occupied, the SDF
will retake it by employing all necessary measures such
as bringing the enemy under control by ground fire from
aircraft and vessels, and then regaining the territory by the
landing of GSDF forces.

**Chapter**


**(2) Initiatives of the MOD/SDF**
For defense posture buildup in the southwestern region,
the ASDF established the 9th Air Wing in January 2016
and newly formed the Southwestern Air Defense Force in
July 2017. The GSDF, in addition to the Yonaguni coast
observation unit formed in March 2016 and other newlyformed units, established the Amphibious Rapid Deployment
Brigade with full-fledged amphibious operation capabilities
in March 2018. Moreover, the GSDF deployed some units,
including an area security unit in Amami Oshima, and an
area security unit in Miyakojima Island, in March 2019.
The GSDF will deploy an area security unit in charge of the
initial response and other units also in Ishigaki Island.
As part of measures to enhance the persistent ISR posture,
the SDF has acquired a new type of destroyer (FFM) and
E-2D airborne early warning aircraft. The Medium Term
Defense Program (FY2019-FY2023; MTDP)[19] plans to
establish one airborne early warning (AEW) wing and
one squadron of unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) units in
the ASDF in addition to the development of new fixed air
defense radar and strengthening of over-the-horizon radar
capabilities.
In order to deal with ships and landing forces attempting
to invade Japan while ensuring the safety of SDF personnel,
the SDF procured stand-off missiles which are capable of
responding from the outside of their threat envelopes, and
started Research and Development (R&D) on technologies
required for new anti-ship missiles and HVGPs (Hyper
Velocity Gliding Projectiles) for the defense of remote


17 Maritime superiority refers to the condition in which one side has a tactical advantage over the opposing force at sea and can carry out maritime operations without suffering substantial
damages by the opposing force.

18 Air superiority refers to the condition in which one side can carry out airborne operations without suffering a significant level of obstruction by the opposing force.

In particular, for the operation of V-22 Ospreys, the
MOD determined that the KYUSHU-SAGA International
AIRPORT was the best airfield to be used as their deployment
site due to positional relationships with the amphibious
deployment brigade and relevant units in joint operations,
the length of the runway, and potential use as relocation
destination of JGSDF Camp Metabaru. In August 2018, the
Governor of Saga prefecture expressed their acceptance. The

since FY2018. R&D on hypersonic weapons is also planned
in the MTDP and necessary expenses are included in the
FY2019 budget.
Also, in order to secure capabilities for swift and largescale transportation and deployment of units, initiatives are
underway to enhance rapid deployment capabilities through:
the improvement of Osumi class LST (Landing Ship, Tank);
and the introduction of V-22 Ospreys and C-2 transport

**Establishment of the Airborne Warning and Control Wing**

The Airborne Early Warning Group is the only unit that has airborne warning and control systems (E-767) and airborne
early warning aircraft (E-2C) equipped with airborne radar. Since its establishment in 1986, the group has been conducting
warning and surveillance in airspaces difficult to survey by warning and control radar on the ground during steady state.
In recent years, in addition to the expansion of Chinese military aircraft to the western Pacific and long-range flights by
Russian military aircraft near Japan, other military activities by neighboring countries have been rapidly expanding and
intensifying near the islands on the Pacific side, where units in charge of warning and surveillance have not been deployed.
The importance of warning and surveillance using airborne warning and control systems is increasing in these air spaces.
In response to this situation, the Airborne Warning and Control Wing will be established by upgrading the Airborne
Early Warning Group in FY2019 in order to strengthen the posture for effective operation of airborne warning and control
systems, etc. The establishment is expected to enhance the SDF’s air defense posture in the airspace around Japan, including
the vast airspace on the Pacific side.
The ASDF has been sequentially upgrading airborne warning and control systems and other equipment owned by the
Airborne Early Warning Group. It will further upgrade such aircraft and other equipment, including by introducing E-2Ds
that are new airborne early warning aircraft and by conducting avionics improvement necessary for retrofit of the current
central computing device of E-767 and installation of electronic warfare support measures.


**Toward Training of V-22 Pilots in Command**

**Major Akira Takeuchi, U.S. Training Team Leader of the 1st Helicopter Brigade, GSDF**
Since 2016, the GSDF has been training personnel in the United States who will play central roles in the introduction of
the V-22. I earned the qualification of V-22 copilot at the Marine Corps Air Station New River, North Carolina, the United
States, in March 2018 and have been participating in the training of V-22 pilots in command there since March 2019.
Here, about 30 GSDF personnel join U.S. marines on a steady basis to undergo training in accordance with their respective
strengths and have been steadily improving their skills to become leading GSDF V-22 experts.
Capable of vertical take-off and landing, the V-22 drastically excels in range, speed and load. This is a dream aircraft
that can change not only future aircraft operations but also the
operation modalities of the entire SDF. After piloting a V-22
I found the both helicopter flight mode and fixed-wing flight
mode amazingly easy, and the operations for mode conversion
are also smooth. Equipped with many fail-safe devices, this is
truly a state-of-the-art and the most reliable aircraft.
During the pilot training, I will improve my skills for safer
flight of V-22s and study their effective and efficient operation
tailored to the characteristics of Japan so that they will manifest
their fighting strength promptly after introduction.

and others.[20] Meanwhile, in May 2019, the MOD explained
their intention to temporarily deploy V-22 Ospreys at Camp
Kisarazu, since there is the prospect that the deployment at
KYUSHU-SAGA International AIRPORT will take a certain
period of time.


The MTDP also stipulates that, in order to strengthen the
transport function to remote islands, the SDF will introduce
logistics support vessels (LSV) and landing craft utilities
(LCU), establish 1 group of maritime transportation units as
a Joint Unit and consider new vessels necessary to smoothly

Meanwhile, various types of training to increase the
capacity for amphibious operations are being undertaken. The
SDF endeavored to increase its capacity through multilateral
joint training RIMPAC 2018 in the United States conducted
from June to August of 2018, joint amphibious operation
training in October 2018 and field training Iron Fist 19 with

The MTDP sets forth that the Amphibious Rapid
Deployment Brigade, which will be strengthened by the
establishment of one amphibious rapid deployment regiment,
will conduct persistent steady-state maneuvers, such as
coordinated activities with ships as well as various training
and exercises.

2 Response to Missile Attacks


**(1) Japan’s Comprehensive Air and Missile Defense Capability**
**a. Basic Concept**
Japan began developing the Ballistic Missile Defense (BMD)
system in FY2004 to be fully prepared for the response
against ballistic missile attacks. Necessary amendments
were subsequently made to the SDF Law in July 2005,
and in December of the same year, the Security Council
(then) and Cabinet decided to begin Japan-U.S. cooperative
development of an advanced ballistic missile interceptor.
To date, Japan has steadily built up its own defense system
against ballistic missile attacks, by such means as installing
ballistic missile defense capability to the Aegis-equipped
destroyers and deploying the Patriot Advanced Capability-3
(PAC-3).[21]

Currently, Japan’s BMD is an effective multi-layered
defense system with the upper tier interception by Aegis
equipped destroyers and the lower tier by Patriot PAC-3,
both interconnected and coordinated by the Japan Aerospace
Defense Ground Environment (JADGE).[22] The upcoming
introduction of the land-based Aegis system, Aegis Ashore,


21 The Patriot PAC-3 system is one of the air defense systems for countering airborne threats. Unlike the conventional type of anti-aircraft PAC-2 missiles, which mainly intercepts aircraft

will enable our forces to intercept missiles in the upper tier
not just from Aegis destroyers but from land.
Today airborne threats to Japan are increasingly complex
and diverse, including ballistic missiles equipped with
multiple/maneuverable warheads, high-speed and longerrange cruise missiles, and stealth and multi-role aircraft. In
order to effectively and efficiently counter these airborne
threats by optimum means and minimize damage, it is
necessary to establish a structure with which to conduct
integrated operation of various equipment pieces, those for
missile defense as well as air defense equipment that each
SDF service has separately used, thereby providing persistent
nation-wide protection from peacetime and also enhancing
the comprehensive air and missile defense capability that can
simultaneously deal with multiple, complex airborne threats.
In this regard, the SDF will strive to standardize and
streamline the means for interception that each SDF service
possesses, including their maintenance and replenishment
systems.
In case ballistic missiles or other objects are launched
against Japan as an armed attack, it will be dealt with
by issuing a defense operation order for armed attack
situations. On the other hand, when such situation is not yet
acknowledged as an armed attack, Japan will take measures
to destroy the ballistic missiles.
As a response against ballistic missiles or other objects,
the Joint Task Force-BMD is formed, with the Commander
of the Air Defense Command serving as its Commander, and
various postures for effective defense are to be taken under a
unified command through JADGE. Furthermore, the GSDF
will play a leading role in dealing with damage caused by the
impact of a fallen ballistic missile.

summit held in February 2019 ended without any agreement
and North Korea has not dismantled all its weapons of mass
destruction or ballistic missiles in a complete, verifiable and
irreversible manner. Taking into consideration the facts that
North Korea is believed to have achieved the miniaturization
of nuclear weapons and have developed nuclear warheads
through repeated nuclear tests and ballistic missile launches
to date, that it possesses and deploys several hundred ballistic
missiles capable of reaching almost every part of Japan, and
that it has pursued enhancement of the operation capabilities
necessary for saturation attacks and its ability to conduct
surprise attacks, there is no change in North Korea's nuclear
weapons and missiles capability.
The MOD/SDF continues to carefully monitor the
concrete actions of North Korea toward the dismantlement of
weapons of mass destruction and missiles, and conducts the
necessary intelligence, warning and surveillance activities,
and other necessary activities while closely cooperating with
the United States and other countries.
Further cooperation with the U.S. Government including
the U.S. Forces in Japan is essential for efficient and
effective operation of the BMD system. Thus, related
measures including constant real-time sharing of BMD
operational and relevant information, and the expansion of
BMD cooperation have been agreed upon at the Japan-U.S.
Security Consultative Committee (2+2 Meeting).
Furthermore, Japan has closely cooperated with the United
States in responding to ballistic missiles, by means such as
receiving Shared Early Warning (SEW)[23] from the U.S.
Forces, and sharing intelligence gathered by assets including
transportable BMD radar (TPY-2 radar) and Aegis-equipped
destroyers deployed in Japan by the U.S. Forces.
Maintenance, enhancement and validation of Japan-U.S.
bilateral response capabilities have been actively conducted
through training and other activities. Since FY2010, BMD
special exercises have been held between the MSDF and the
U.S. Navy, connecting their ships and other equipment via
a network to conduct a simulation of response to ballistic
missiles. In 2018, the ASDF participated in this exercise, and
the GSDF joined in 2019. The exercise is conducted as a
joint Japan-U.S. air defense/missile defense exercise aimed
to improve tactical skills and strengthen cooperation.
Beyond Japan-U.S. cooperation, there is also a need to
bolster cooperation between the United States, Japan and
the Republic of Korea. In January, March, October and
December 2017, trilateral ballistic missile information
sharing exercises were held in waters off Japan with the
objective of strengthening coordination

With respect to the sharing of finely detailed information
related to ballistic missiles, etc. with relevant countries,
including the United States, the passage of the Specially
Designated Secrets Act in December 2014 (Law no. 108,
2013) has established the basis for protection of highly
confidential information related to national security. This has
promoted increased sharing of information not just within
the government but with the United States and other relevant
countries.
In addition, the Japan-ROK General Security of Military
Information Agreement (GSOMIA)[24] entered into effect
on November 2016. GSOMIA serves as a framework for
protecting various confidential information, including
information regarding North Korea’s nuclear and missile
threat, shared between Japan and the ROK, which will be
required for practical and effective responses to various
situations. However, in August 2019, the Government of
the ROK notified the Government of Japan of its intention
to terminate the GSOMIA in writing. The MOD/SDF will
expend all possible means to monitor the situation and gather
intelligence in order to avoid causing any deficiency in the
defense of Japan.
The SDF engages in various training on a daily basis to
improve its capability to counter ballistic missiles. It has
been conducting PAC-3 maneuver deployment training from
June 2017 in an effort to strengthen the SDF’s capability
to counter ballistic missiles and generate a sense of safety
and security among the public. It has conducted 22 training
sessions as of the end of June 2019 including deployments to
U.S. Forces Japan’s facilities.

Aegis Destroyer JS “Atago,” refurbished to give ballistic missile defense capability and
conducting a test launch of SM-3 BLK IB (September 2018)

equipped destroyers with BMD capabilities from the present
six to eight by FY2020.
Meanwhile, Japan and the United States are jointly
developing advanced interceptor missiles for BMD (SM-3
Block IIA), which will be the successor to SM-3 Block IA
to be mounted on Aegis-equipped destroyers, and promoting
the project to its deployment, in order to deal with future
threats posed by increasingly advanced and diverse ballistic
missile attacks.
At the National Security Council 9-Minister Meeting
in December 2016, a decision was made to transition to
joint production and the deployment phase. Since the
FY2017 budget, SM-3 Block IIA acquisitions are ongoing.
Acquisition and deployment of SM-3 Block IIA are planned
to be implemented in FY2021.
In comparison with the previous SM-3 Block IA, SM-3
Block IIA will have not only extended interceptable altitude
and coverage of protection, but also have enhanced defeating
capability and simultaneous engagement capability. In
addition, it is expected that the interception capabilities of
SM-3 Block IIA will be enhanced against ballistic missiles
equipped with interception avoidance measures such as a
decoy and ballistic missiles launched with an intention to
avoid being intercepted by taking a higher than nominal
trajectory (lofted trajectory).[25]

With regard to Patriot PAC-3, necessary expenses
have been appropriated in the supplementary budgets
for FY2016 and FY2017 to enable the acquisition of the
enhanced capability type, PAC-3 (MSE) (Missile Segment
Enhancement). Introduction of PAC-3MSE will realize the
extension of interception altitude from less than 20 km to
tens of km, meaning that the coverage of protection (area)
will expand more than twice compared with the current
PAC-3.
In this way Japan is taking measures necessary to
strengthen its protection structure and plans to continue the


**c. Initiatives towards Strengthening of the BMD System**
Currently the SDF maneuvers and deploys according to
situation Aegis-equipped destroyers for defense of the entire
territory of Japan and PAC-3, which is deployed across
the country for the defense of stationing locations. On that
premise, the SDF has worked to increase the number of Aegis
BMD destroyers. Of the six MSDF Aegis-equipped destroyers
that are present, the MOD completed refurbishment of two
without BMD capabilities, “Atago” and “Ashigara,” to give
them BMD capabilities by December 2018. The MOD also
decided to acquire two additional Aegis-equipped destroyers
with BMD capabilities using the FY2015 and FY2016
budgets. These projects will increase the number of Aegis

efforts.[26]

**d. Introduction of Aegis Ashore**
In the past, the BMD of Japan was based on deploying Aegisequipped destroyers, etc. in preparation for interception for
a required period of time after early detection of signs of
missile launch. Under the past posture regarding a possible
missile attack on Japan, the MOD has believed that protection
of the entire territory of Japan was possible if about two of
the destroyers continued BMD missions in the sea for a
certain period of time with a system of eight Aegis-equipped
destroyers.
Meanwhile, North Korea has improved its practical launch
capability using a transporter erector launcher (TEL) and
developed submarine-launched ballistic missiles (SLBM),
which makes it difficult to grasp signs of launch at an early
stage. In light of the changing situation, it is necessary to
maintain a persistent 24-hour, 365-day deployment of Aegisequipped destroyers for a long period of over one year. This
fact triggered a review of the past Japanese ballistic missile
defense posture itself.
Furthermore, under the current Aegis equipped destroyer
system that requires frequent long-term deployment, the
working environment for crew onboard these destroyers
is extremely severe. The service requires high level of
concentration day and night to cope with ballistic missiles
that can be launched anytime.
Under these circumstances, with North Korea’s nuclear
weapons and missiles posing a severe and imminent threat
to the safety of our country, Japan must work to drastically
upgrade its ballistic missile defense capabilities in order to
ensure constant and sustained protection from peacetime.
At meetings of the National Security Council and Cabinet
in December 2017, a decision was made to purchase two
Aegis Ashore units, to be retained by the GSDF. Aegis
Ashore refers to a missile defense system that consists of
radars, a command communication system, a vertical launch
system (VLS), etc. similar to Aegis-equipped destroyers but
deployed on the ground. Aegis Ashore intercepts ballistic
missiles flying in space outside of the Earth’s atmosphere
from the ground. It is a piece of equipment with parts other
than the ship hull of an Aegis-equipped destroyer on the
ground in a fixed position. The introduction of two units of
Aegis Ashore would enable seamless defense of the entire
territory of Japan 24 hours a day and 365 days a year, and the
burden on personnel is anticipated to be lifted significantly.
Under the system of eight Aegis-equipped destroyers, about
two of them had to focus on BMD mission only in the sea


in order to protect the entire territory of Japan. Once Aegis
Ashore is deployed, the Aegis-equipped destroyers can be
used for missions ensuring maritime security, conducting
training to maintain these skills, and ensuring sufficient
change of crewmembers, which will be connected to further
strengthen Japan’s deterrence capability as a whole. The
radar units to be mounted on the Aegis Ashore are state-ofthe-art high-performance radar units called Lockheed Martin
Solid State Radar (LMSSR). This radar will drastically
enhance Japan’s capabilities to respond to ballistic missiles,
and includes enhancement of the capability against lofted
trajectory launches and response to simultaneous majority
attacks compared with Aegis-equipped destroyer of the
MSDF.
Since GSDF Araya Maneuver Area in Akita Prefecture
and Mutsumi Maneuver Area in Yamaguchi Prefecture
were selected as candidate sites for the deployment of
two units of Aegis Ashore, the MOD has repeated briefing
sessions for local governments and residents and provided
explanations on the necessary survey and the need for the
deployment. However, there has been much inappropriate
conduct, such as mistakes in briefing material and behavior
showing a lack of respect by a defense official at the briefing
session. The MOD sincerely reflects on our past conduct.
In order to prevent a similar incident from occurring and to
fundamentally strengthen the internal study framework, the
MOD established “Aegis Ashore Introduction Promotion
Headquarters” in June 2019, with the State Minister of
Defense as the head of the office.
Regarding Aegis Ashore, the MOD believes that the
basic premise is to deploy and operate it without impact
on residents. Residents have voiced, to the MOD, various
doubts and concerns about the need for and safety of the
deployment, and the ministry will continue to provide
explanations on them in a concrete and easy-to-understand
manner with the best of intentions.

**(2) Missile Defense of the United States and Japan-U.S. BMD**
**Technical Cooperation**

**a. Missile Defense of the United States**
The United States is developing a multi-tier missile defense
system that combines defense systems suited for each of the
following phases of the ballistic missile flight path to provide
a mutually complementary response: (1) the boost phase,
(2) the mid-course phase, and (3) the terminal phase. Japan
and the United States have developed close coordination
concerning ballistic missile defense, and a part of the missile
defense system of the United States has been deployed in our

country in a step-by-step manner.[27]

**b. Japan-U.S. BMD Technology Cooperation, etc.**
The Government commenced a Japan-U.S. cooperative
research project on a sea-based upper-tier system in
FY1999. As the result showed good prospects for resolving
initial technical challenges, in December 2005, the Security
Council (then) and the Cabinet decided to start Japan-U.S.
cooperative development of an advanced ballistic missile
interceptor by using the results of the project as a technical
basis. The joint development started in June 2006 with a view
to expanding the coverage of protection[28] and dealing with
future threats posed by increasingly advanced and diverse
ballistic missiles attacks.
In February and June 2017, Japan and the United States
conducted tests of the SM-3 Block IIA interceptor in waters
off Hawaii. Analysis of the test data confirmed that it meets
all performance requirements.
Currently, as part of development work, the United States
is carrying out validation of the data connection between the
Aegis system and the SM-3 Block IIA, and between radars.
Japan continues to cooperate as required.

3 Response to Attacks by Guerillas, Special Operations
Forces and Others


In Japan, where most of the towns and cities are highly
urbanized, even small-scale infiltrations and attacks can
pose a serious threat against the country’s peace and security.
These cases refer to various mode and forms including illegal
activities by infiltrated foreign armed agents[29] etc., and
sabotage carried out by foreign guerillas or special forces,
which can be deemed as an armed attack against Japan.


case cannot be dealt with by the general police force, then
public security operations by the SDF will be implemented.
Furthermore, if it has been confirmed that an armed attack is
being carried out against Japan, the SDF will respond under
a defense operation order.

**(2) Responses to Attacks by Guerillas and Special Operations**
**Forces**

Typical forms of attacks by guerrillas or special forces
include the destruction of critical private infrastructure and
other facilities, attacks against people, and assassinations of
dignitaries.
In dealing with attacks by guerrillas or special forces,
the MOD/SDF responds with a particular emphasis on the
establishment of a relevant information gathering posture,
warning and surveillance to prevent invasions in coastal
areas, protection of key facilities, and search and destruction
of invading guerrillas or special forces. Efforts will be
made for early detection of attacks and indications through
warning and surveillance, and, as required, the SDF units
will be deployed to protect key facilities, such as nuclear
power plants, and the necessary posture for protection will
be established at an early stage. Based on this, in the event
of an infiltration of our territory by guerrillas or special
operations forces, they will be searched for and detected by
reconnaissance units, aviation units and others and combat
units will be promptly deployed to besiege and capture or to
destroy them.
The MTDP states that in order to enhance the ability to
respond effectively and efficiently, the SDF will improve its
ISR posture and its ability to protect key facilities, including
nuclear power plants, and search and destroy infiltrating
units.


**Chapter**


**(1) Basic Concept**
In the stage where the actual situation of intruders and the
details of the ongoing case are not clear, the police primarily
respond to the situation, while the MOD/SDF will collect
relevant information and reinforce the security of the SDF
facilities. When the situation is clearer and can be dealt
with by the general police force, various forms of assistance
such as transportation of police officers and provision of
equipment to the police force will be carried out. If the


See Fig. III-1-2-10 (Example of Operations against the Attacks by
Guerillas and Special Forces)

**(3) Response to Armed Agents**
**a. Basic Concept**
While the police assume primary responsibility for
responding to illegal activities of armed agents, the SDF
will respond in accordance with situational developments.


27 Specifically, a TPY-2 radar (so-called “X-band radar”) for BMD has been deployed at the U.S. Shariki Communication Site in 2006. In October 2006, Patriot PAC-3 units were deployed in
Okinawa Prefecture, and in October 2007, a Joint Tactical Ground Station (JTAGS) was deployed in Aomori Prefecture. Furthermore, the 2nd TPY-2 radar was deployed at the U.S.
Kyogamisaki Communication Site in December 2014.

In addition, BMD-capable Aegis ships of the U.S. Forces were deployed at Commander Fleet Activities, Yokosuka (Yokosuka City, Kanagawa Prefecture) in October 2015, March 2016 and
May 2018.

28 With regard to the Japan-U.S. cooperative development, it is necessary to export BMD related arms from Japan to the United States. In accordance with the Chief Cabinet Secretary’s
statement issued in December 2004, it was determined that the Three Principles on Arms Exports would not apply to the BMD system and related matters under the condition that strict
controls are maintained. Based on these circumstances, it was decided that the prior consent of Japan could be given to the third party transfer of the SM-3 Block IIA under certain
conditions. This decision was formally announced in the Joint Statement of the Japan-U.S. Security Consultative Committee (2+2 Meeting) in June 2011.

The Three Principles on Transfer of Defense Equipment and Technology (Three Principles) received Cabinet approval in April 2014. However, with regard to exceptional measures instigated
before the Three Principles were decided, overseas transfers will continue to be organized in the guidelines for the principles as allowable under the Three Principles.

When this happens, the SDF cooperates with the police
force. Accordingly, with regard to public security operations
of the SDF, the Basic Agreement[30] concerning cooperation
procedures between the SDF and the police, as well as
local agreements between GSDF divisions/brigades and
prefectural police forces, have been concluded.[31]

suspicious vessels are also continuously conducted between
the MSDF and the Japan Coast Guard.

**(4) Response to Nuclear, Biological, and Chemical Weapons**
In recent years, there has been strong recognition of the
danger of NBC (Nuclear, Biological, and Chemical) weapon
proliferation, which can cause indiscriminate mass casualties
and contamination of an extensive area, and the means for
transporting such weapons, as well as related equipment
and materials, to terrorists and countries under suspicion
of proliferating such weapons. The sarin gas attack[33] on the
Tokyo subway in March 1995 is one of the examples of an
incident in which these weapons were used.
**a. Basic Concept**
In the event of the use of NBC weapons in Japan in a way


**b. Initiatives of the MOD/SDF**
The GSDF has been conducting field training exercises
nationwide with the police of each prefecture, in an effort to
strengthen such collaboration by, for example, conducting
field exercises at nuclear power plants throughout the country
since 2012.[32] Furthermore, joint exercises in dealing with


30 The Agreement on the Maintenance of Public Order in the Event of Public Security Operations, which was concluded between the then Defense Agency and the National Public Safety
Commission (concluded in 1954 and fully revised in 2000).

31 In 2004, guidelines were jointly formulated between the National Police Agency and the Defense Agency concerning dealing jointly with public security operations in the event of armed
agent incidents.

32 The GSDF also conducted exercises on the ground at Ikata Nuclear Power Plant (Ehime Prefecture) in 2012, at Tomari Nuclear Power Plant (Hokkaido) and Mihama Nuclear Power Plant (Fukui
Prefecture) in 2013, at Shimane Nuclear Power Plant (Shimane Prefecture) in 2014, at Higashidori Nuclear Power Plant (Aomori Prefecture) and Kashiwazaki-Kariwa Nuclear Power Plant
(Niigata Prefecture) in 2015, at Takahama Nuclear Power Plant (Fukui Prefecture) in 2016, at Hamaoka Nuclear Power Plant (Shizuoka Prefecture) and Shiga Nuclear Power Plant (Ishikawa
Prefecture) in 2017, and at Genkai Nuclear Power Plant (Saga Prefecture) in 2019.

ground forces, which was expected primarily during the
Cold War, will be retained.
In the event of a military attack on Japan, the SDF will
respond with defensive mobilization. Their operations
are categorized into (1) operations for aerial air defense
operations, (2) defense operations protecting waters around
Japan, (3) operations protecting the land, and (4) operations
ensuring security in maritime communication, based on the
characteristic of their purposes. In executing these operations,
the U.S. Forces will assist the operations implemented by the
SDF and deploy operations to complement the capabilities of
the SDF, including the use of striking power, in line with the
Guidelines for Japan-U.S. Defense Cooperation.

**(1) Air Defense Operations**
Based on the geographic features of Japan, in that it is
surrounded by the sea, and the features of modern wars,[34]
it is expected that Japan will be repeatedly hit by rapid and
surprise aerial attacks by aircraft and missiles in the case
where a full-scale invasion against Japan occurs. Operations
for aerial defense[35] aim to deal with enemy aerial attacks at
the farthest point from our territory, prohibiting enemies from
gaining air superiority and preventing harm to the people and
the sovereign territory of Japan. At the same time, efforts
will be made to inflict significant damage on the enemy thus
making the continuation of their aerial attack difficult.


**Chapter**


Policemen of Yamagata Prefectural Police and GSDF personnel conducting training

(February 2018)

that corresponds to an armed attack, the SDF will conduct
defense operations to repel the armed attack and rescue
victims. Furthermore, in the event of the use of NBC
weapons in a way that does not correspond to an armed
attack but against which the general police alone cannot
maintain public security, the SDF will conduct public
security operations to suppress the armed group and rescue
victims in cooperation with related agencies. Furthermore,
when the incident does not fall under the category of defense
operations or public security operations, the chemical
protection units of the GSDF and medical units of the
ASDF, GSDF and MSDF will cooperate with relevant
organizations in information gathering concerning the extent
of the damage, decontamination activities, transportation of
the sick and injured, and medical activities through disaster
relief and civil protection dispatches.
**b. Initiatives of the MOD/SDF**
The MOD/SDF possesses and maintains the GSDF Central
Nuclear Biological Chemical (NBC) Weapon Defense Unit
and the Countermeasure Medical Unit as well as increasing
the number of chemical and medical protection unit personnel,
in order to improve the capability for responding to NBC
weapon attacks. Also, the GSDF has designated personnel
to take initial action in the event of extraordinary disasters
in order to allow operations to begin within approximately
one hour.
The MSDF and the ASDF have also acquired protective
equipment and materials to be used on vessels and at bases.


**(2) Defense Operations Protecting Waters Surrounding Japan**
If an armed attack is carried out against Japan, which is an
island country, aerial attacks are expected to be combined with
attacks against our ships and territory by enemy destroyers.
In addition, transport vessels could be deployed to enable
massive enemy ground forces to invade our territory. Our
defense operations protecting the waters surrounding Japan
are composed of measures at sea, measures in waters around
our coasts, measures in major straits, and aerial defense
above waters around Japan. We need to protect the waters
around our country by combining these multiple operations,
blocking the invasion of our enemies, and attacking and
depleting their combat capabilities.

**(3) Operations Protecting the Land**
In order to invade the islands of Japan, invading countries
are expected to gain sea and air superiority, followed by the
landing of ground troops from the sea and airborne troops
from the air.
For invading ground and airborne troops, it tends to be


4 Readiness against Invasion


The NDPG states that only the necessary level of readiness
against land invasions involving the mobilization of large


34 Aerial attacks are important elements influencing the results of modern wars. It is vital to obtain air superiority before or at the same time as implementing ground or maritime operations.
35 A special characteristic of operations for aerial defense is that initial response is critical and can influence the entirety of operations. Thus, Japan needs to maintain its readiness for a

difficult to exert systematic combat capabilities while they
are moving on their vessels or aircraft or right before or after
they land in our territory. As we protect our land, we need
to make best use of this weakness to deal with our enemies
between coastal and sea areas or at landing points as much as
possible and attack them at an early stage.

**(4) Operations Ensuring Security in Maritime Transportation**
Japan depends upon other countries for the supply of much
of its resources and food, making maritime transportation
routes the lifeblood for securing the foundation of our
existence and prosperity. Furthermore, if our country comes
under armed attack, etc., maritime transportation routes will
be the foundation to maintain continuous warfare capabilities
and enable the U.S. Forces to come and assist in the defense
of Japan.
In operations to ensure the safety of our maritime
transportation, the SDF combines various operations such
as anti-sea, anti-submarine, anti-air and anti-mine operations
to patrol,[36] defend SDF ships, and protect straits and ports,
as well as setting up sea lanes[37] to directly defend Japanese
ships, etc. Aerial defense (anti-air operations) for Japanese
ships on maritime transportation routes is conducted by
destroyers, and support from fighter jets and other aircraft is
provided as required.

**(2) Initiatives of the MOD/SDF to Facilitate Measures for**
**Civilian Protection**

**a. Civil Protection Training**
For sound and expeditious implementation of measures to
protect civilians, it is important to conduct training on a
regular basis to ensure effective and efficient collaboration
with concerned ministries, agencies and local governments.
The MOD and the SDF hold exercises in cooperation with
concerned ministries and agencies and with the participation
of local governments and others. They also participate
and cooperate in civil protection exercises held by other
ministries, agencies and local governments.
For example, civil protection training was hosted by the
central government (Cabinet Secretariat and the Fire Defense
Agency) and local governments (Aichi prefecture and Toyota
City) in Toyota City, Aichi in January 2019. The GSDF,
MSDF, ASDF and JSDF Aichi Provincial Cooperation
Office also participated in the training in preparation for an
incident during an international sports event.


5 Initiatives Related to the Protection of Civilians


**(1) Basic Policy on the Protection of Civilians and the Role of**
**the MOD/SDF**

In March 2005, based on Article 32 of the Civil Protection
Act, the government established the Basic Guidelines for the
Protection of the People. It anticipates four types of armed
attack: 1) a land invasion, 2) an attack by guerrillas or special
forces, 3) a ballistic missile attack, 4) an air attack and points
to consider in taking measures to protect civilians depending
on the type of attack.
The MOD/SDF, based on the Civil Protection Act and the
Basic Guidelines, have developed a Civil Protection Plan
of the MOD and the Acquisition, Technology and Logistics
Agency. This plan stipulates that in a situation where Japan
is under attack, the SDF would make utmost efforts to fulfill
its basic task of repelling the attack It also states that, within
the scope of no hindrance to the task, the SDF would do as
much as possible to protect civilians through support on
evacuation and disaster relief.

See Part II, Chapter 5, Section 2-1-4 (Civil Protection)


See Reference 19 (Participation of the Ministry of Defense and the
SDF in Civil Protection Joint Training Exercises with Central
and Local Government Bodies [2018])

**b. Ongoing Collaboration with Local Governments**
The MOD and the SDF are establishing liaison departments
in Regional Armies and Provincial Cooperation Offices
to ensure ongoing and close collaboration with local
governments and other bodies.
Civilian protection councils are also being established
in local governments for comprehensive implementation of
measures to protect civilians. Representatives of each branch
of the SDF and Regional Defense Bureau officials have been
appointed to the councils.
Moreover, local governments are recruiting retired SDF

**3** **Responses in the Domains of Space, Cyberspace and Electromagnetic Spectrum**


Among the roles that must be served by Japan’s defense
capability as set forth in the NDPG, the idea of “(3) response
in space, cyberspace and electromagnetic domains during all
phases” is as follows.
In order to prevent any actions that impede its activities
in space, cyberspace and electromagnetic domains, the SDF,
on a steady-state basis, conducts persistent monitoring as
well as collection and analysis of relevant information. In
the event of such an event, the SDF will promptly identify
incidents and take such measures as damage limitation and
recovery. In case of an armed attack against Japan, the SDF
will, on top of taking these actions, block and eliminate the
attack by leveraging capabilities in space, cyberspace and
electromagnetic domains.
Furthermore, in light of society’s growing dependence
on space and cyberspace, the SDF will contribute to
comprehensive, whole-of-government efforts concerning
these domains under appropriate partnership and shared
responsibility with relevant organizations.
Initiatives carried out based on this role are explained
below.

bases. Amid rising dependence on space systems and
increasing threats and risks in space, “mission assurance”
initiatives are underway to ensure stable space operations
including detection and avoidance of threats and risks,
increased survivability of the systems themselves and early
recovery of functionality.
Responding to Japan’s progress in development and
use of outer space, the Diet approved the Act on Ensuring
Appropriate Handling of Satellite Remote Sensing Data
(Remote Sensing Data Act) and Act on Launch of Artificial
Satellites and Launch Vehicles and Control of Artificial
Satellites (Space Activities Act) in November 2016, and the
Remote Sensing Data Act and part of the Space Activities
Act went into effect in November 2017. The Space Activities
Act fully went into effect in November 2018.
The Space Activities Act stipulates matters necessary to
secure public safety and provide prompt protection of the
victims from damages in Japan’s space development and use,
such as a launch permit system, obligation for reparation,
and government compensation. In addition, the Remote
Sensing Data Act established (1) a license pertaining to use
of satellite remote sensing instruments, (2) a certification
of persons handling satellite remote sensing data and (3) a
system that enables the Prime Minister to issue an order to a
satellite remote sensing data holder to prohibit provision of
data under certain occasions.

1 Responses in Space Domain


**(1) The Whole-of-Government Approach**
The Office of National Space Policy[38] established in the
Cabinet Office in July 2012 engages in the planning,
drafting, coordinating, and other policy matters relating to
the Government’s development and use of space. In light of
the environmental changes surrounding space policy and the
new security policies stated in the NSS that was approved
by the Cabinet in 2013, the Basic Plan on Space Policy[39]
was decided upon in the Strategic Headquarters for Space
Development which was established within the Cabinet in
January 2015. This Basic Plan was prepared as a 10-year
development plan focusing on the next approximately 20
years to improve the predictability of industries’ investments,
and strengthen the industrial base, and has the following
goals: (1) Ensuring space security; (2) Promoting the use
of space in the civilian sector; and (3) Maintaining and
strengthening of space industry and scientific/technological


**(2) Initiatives of the MOD/SDF**
Effective use of satellites for such purposes as informationgathering, communication and positioning is essential for
realizing cross-domain operations. On the other hand, threats
to the stable use of space are increasing.
The MOD/ SDF has sought to ensure effective and
efficient use of space by strengthening information gathering,
C2 (command & control) and communication capabilities
by using satellites and through Space Situational Awareness
(SSA). In addition to these initiatives, based on the MTDP,
the MOD/SDF will work to enhance capabilities to ensure
superiority in use of space at all stages from peacetime to
armed contingencies. The efforts include (1) establishing an
SSA system in order to secure the stable use of space; (2)


38 In April 2016, the Office of National Space Policy was reorganized into the National Space Policy Secretariat.

disrupt C4I (command, control, communication, computer,
and intelligence) of opponents in collaboration with the
electromagnetic domain.
In so doing, the SDF will (4) work to enhance cooperation
with relevant agencies, including the Japan Aerospace
Exploration Agency (JAXA), and with the United States and
other relevant countries. The SDF will also engage in such
organization building as the creation of units specializing
in space and a dedicated career field, and develop human
resources and accumulate knowledge and expertise in the
space domain.

is underway, increasing the threat to the stable use of outer
space.
That is why the MOD, based on the Basic Plan on Space
Policy and through cooperation with relevant domestic
institutions, such as the JAXA, and the U.S., aims to
establish SSA by 2022 to monitor and maintain an accurate
picture of conditions in space. It is also working to deploy
radar to monitor threats to Japanese satellites, such as space
debris, and its operating system for information gathering,
processing and sharing. The SDF will establish one squadron
of the ASDF space domain specialized unit to operate the
system and new specialty dedicated to the space domain.
For this to happen, the government agencies and ministries
concerned need to work together to build an effective
operating system. On this point, JAXA is devising a plan to
deploy radar able to monitor low Earth orbit (at altitudes of up
to 1,000 km) and a ground-based optical telescope to monitor
geostationary orbit (at altitudes of around 36,000 km).
Combined with the radar of the MOD that will principally
be dedicated to geostationary orbit monitoring, Japan is
planning an effective SSA program. For its operation system,
necessary adjustment is in progress to link the system to the


**a. Development of the SSA System**
When using outer space, it is necessary to ensure its stable

For the future, in addition to radar to monitor threats
to Japanese satellites such as space debris as mentioned
above, the MOD will introduce SSA satellites that are
space-based optical telescopes and ground-based SSA laser
ranging devices to measure distance from low earth-orbit
satellites. The expenses for study of their costs, functions and
performance are included in the FY2019 budget.

Gathering Satellites (IGS) and commercial satellites,
including microsatellites. It will also continue to use
images from the satellite operated by JAXA (ALOS-2) and
information from Automatic Identification System, etc., and
conduct research on dual wavelength infrared sensors.[40]

Regarding communications, the MOD/SDF launched an
X-band defense communications satellite called Kirameki-2
in January 2017 and Kirameki-1 in April 2018, owned
and operated by the MOD for the first time, to be used
for the communications, which is essential for command
and control in unit operations. Going forward, in light of
the future increase in communication requirements, the
MOD will conduct steady development of Kirameki-3 to
realize integrated communications as well as high-speed
and large capacity communications, thereby aiming for the
early realization of a three-satellite constellation with all of
the three X-band defense communications satellites. The

ministry will also conduct research and surveys on the next
defense communication satellites.
With regard to positioning, the MOD/SDF has mounted
GPS receiving terminals on a large number of equipment and
used them as important means to support troop movement,
including highly accurate self-positioning and improvement
of missile guidance. In addition to these efforts, the QuasiZenith Satellite System (QZSS) of the Cabinet Office started
service in November 2018. With this in mind, the MOD/SDF
will continue considering the securing of redundancy by
using multiple positioning satellite signals, including QZSS,
while considering its cost effectiveness.
**c. Enhancing Capabilities to Ensure Superiority in Use of**
**Space**
Utilization of satellites plays a vital role as the basic
infrastructure for security, while some countries appear to be
developing anti-satellite weapons, including killer satellites
and anti-satellite missiles. In this context, the MOD/SDF
needs to improve the resilience of the X-band defense
communications satellite and other satellites.
To this purpose, the SDF will newly introduce training
devices to study and train responses to the vulnerabilities
of Japanese satellites, and devices to grasp the state of
electromagnetic interference against Japanese satellites.
Expenses for study and research[41] necessary for this purpose
are included in the FY2019 budget.
The SDF will build the capability to disrupt C4I of
opponents in coordination with the electromagnetic domain.
**d. Enhancing Cooperation with Relevant Agencies and with**
**the United States and Other Relevant Countries**
For the MOD to promote space development and use
effectively, it is essential to enhance cooperation with relevant
agencies with advanced knowledge, including JAXA, and
with the United States and other relevant countries.
Currently the MOD and JAXA are cooperating in
the development of SSA described above and technical
demonstration of dual wavelength infrared sensors. In
addition, the ministry exchanges human resources, including
the dispatch of ASDF personnel to the JAXA Tsukuba Space
Center.
Also, from the perspective of further promoting
cooperation in the space field between the defense authorities
of Japan and the United States, the two countries established
the “Japan-US Space Cooperation Working Group (SCWG)”


in April 2015 and so far held five meetings. The SCWG
continues to promote consideration in broader fields such
as: (1) promotion of space policy-related consultation, (2)
closer information sharing, (3) cooperation for training and
securing space experts, and (4) continued participation to
tabletop exercises.
As part of such initiatives, the MOD has taken part in the
annual SSA multinational tabletop exercise hosted by the
U.S. Strategic Command since 2016 with the purpose of
acquiring knowledge related to the SSA operation as well
as of strengthening cooperation with the United States and
other partner countries. These efforts to enhance the SSA
capabilities also contribute to enhancing deterrence against
new threats in outer space.
In October 2018, the MOD took part for the first time in
the Schriever Wargame, a multinational tabletop exercise
hosted by the U.S. Air Force Space Command to deepen
space cooperation with participating countries and to think
about its further space polices.
Japan engages in space security dialogues not only with
the United States but also with France, the European Union
(EU), and India.

2 Response in Cyber Domain


**(1) The Whole-of-Government Approach and Other Initiatives**
With regard to cybersecurity, the number of cases that
were detected as suspicious communication to Japanese
governmental organizations and required confirmation as to
whether or not they need coping, there were 111 suspicious
malware infections and 66 targeted attacks in FY2018.
This is a situation which requires sufficient and continuous
attention.[42]

In order to deal with the increasing threat to cybersecurity,
in November 2014, the Cyber Security Basic Act was
enacted. The Act aims to contribute to the security of Japan
by comprehensively and effectively promoting the measures
regarding cybersecurity.
In response to this, in January 2015, the CyberSecurity
Strategic Headquarters was established in the Cabinet, and the
National center of Incident readiness and Strategy for Cyber

**Participating in a Multinational Tabletop Exercise Schriever Wargame**

In October 2018, the MOF/SDF together with other space-related organizations of Japan (National Security Secretariat,
Cabinet Office, Ministry of Internal Affairs and Communications, Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Ministry of Education,
Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry, Cabinet Satellite Intelligence Center
and Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency [JAXA]) and other countries participated in multinational tabletop exercise
named the Schriever Wargame, hosted by the U.S. Air Force Space Command. This was the first participation in the
exercise from Japan.
The Schriever Wargame is a multinational tabletop exercise involving wide-ranging discussions from strategy to
operation level on responses to various situations in outer space, which are anticipated to arise in about ten years from
now. This time, the United Kingdom, Australia, Canada,
New Zealand, France and Germany also participated in the
exercise in addition to the United States.
In recent years, space debris, anti-satellite weapons,
and other risks that could interfere with the stable use of
outer space have been growing. In this context it is vitally
important to respond to these risks effectively in cooperation
with relevant ministries and the international community
in order to ensure security. In the Schriever Wargame we
were able to have wide-ranging discussions on cooperation
with the United States and other partner countries in the
new domain, space. The MOD/SDF will continue to take
similar opportunities to further strengthen cooperation with
relevant countries in the new domains. Schriever Wargame participants from Japan


Security (NISC)[43] was established in the Cabinet Secretariat.
The NISC is responsible for planning and promotion of
cyber security-related policies and serves as the control
tower in taking measures and responding to significant
cybersecurity incidents in government organizations and
agencies, as well as critical infrastructures. Furthermore, in
September 2015, the Cybersecurity Strategy was formulated
for the comprehensive and effective promotion of measures
pertaining to cybersecurity, with the aims to create and
develop free, fair and safe cyber space to enhance the vitality
of the economy and society and realize their sustainable
development, to realize a society in which citizens can live
safely and with peace of mind, and to contribute to the peace
and stability of the international community as well as the
security of Japan. Furthermore, in July 2018 the strategy
was reviewed to promote cybersecurity for sustainable
development and initiatives from three perspectives ((1)
mission assurance by service providers, (2) risk management,
and (3) participation, cooperation and collaboration), while
sticking with the basic position of the strategy.


**(2) Initiatives of the MOD/SDF**
Information and communications networks that leverage
cyberspace form a foundation for the SDF’s activities in
various domains, and any attack against them would seriously
disrupt the organized activities of the SDF.
The MOD/SDF has engaged in holistic measures
including the following: introduction of intrusion prevention
systems, in order to ensure the safety of information and
communication systems; development of defense systems,
such as the security and analysis devices for cyber defense;
monitoring of MOD/SDF communications networks around
the clock and response to cyber attacks[44] by the SDF C4
(Command, Control, Communication & Computers) Systems
Command and others; enactment of regulations[45] stipulating
postures and procedures for responding to cyber attacks;
research on cutting-edge technology; development of human
resources, and collaboration with other organizations.
In addition to these initiatives, based on the NDPG,
the SDF will fundamentally strengthen its cyber defense
capability, including the capability to disrupt, during an

**a. Establishing an Environment for Ensuring Cyber Security**
**(a) Expanding the Structure of Cyber Defense Group and**
**Other Units**
“Cyber Defense Group” was established under the SDF C4
Systems Command in March 2014. In order to appropriately
deal with cyber attacks that are becoming more sophisticated
and skillful day by day, the Cyber Defense Group was
expanded from approximately 110 to 150 personnel in
FY2018 to strengthen the posture. For the future, the
group will be further expanded by about 70 personnel to
approximately 220 in FY2019. Furthermore, the structure of
the SDF C4 Systems Command will be reviewed and a cyber
defense unit will be newly established as a joint unit by FY
2023.
**(b) Strengthening Capabilities of Information Gathering,**
**Research and Analysis**
In order to secure functions of the system and network
of the MOD/SDF under any circumstance, it is necessary to
strengthen the capabilities of information gathering, research
and analysis, and develop a practical training environment.
To this end, the MOD/SDF will continue initiatives
such as (1) upgrade of information gathering devices for
indications and techniques of cyber attacks, (2) enhancing
functions of analysis devices for cyber protection, and (3)

team.
**b. Keeping Abreast of the Latest Information Including Risks,**
**Counter Measures and Technological Trends**
In order to respond to cyber attacks in a swift and appropriate
manner, it is necessary to keep abreast of the latest
information, including cyber-related risks, counter measures
and technological trends, through cooperation with the
private sector, and strategic talks, joint exercises and other
opportunities with allies and other parties. For this purpose
the MOD/SDF will effectively cooperate with private
companies and foreign countries, including the United
States, which is Japan’s ally.
**(a) Cooperating with Private Companies and Others**
In Japan, in July 2013, the “Cyber Defense Council” (CDC)
was set up, and its core members consist of around ten
companies in the defense industry with a strong interest in
cybersecurity. The MOD/SDF and the defense industry have
made efforts to deal with cyber attacks through joint exercise
and other initiatives.
**(b) Cooperation with the United States**
Since comprehensive defense cooperation, including joint
response, between Japan and its ally the United States is
vital, the two countries set up the Cyber Defense Policy
Working Group (CDPWG) as a framework between the
defense authorities of Japan and the United States. Under
this framework, meetings have been held six times to discuss
the following topics: (1) promotion of policy discussions
regarding cyber issues, (2) closer sharing of information, (3)
promotion of joint exercises incorporating response to cyber
attacks, and (4) matters such as cooperation for training
and maintaining experts. Moreover, in May 2015, the two
countries announced a joint statement on the specific future
direction of the cooperation.
In addition, Japan’s cooperation with the United States is
to be further strengthened by such means as participation in
the “Japan-U.S. Cyber Dialogue,” a whole-of-government
approach by both nations, holding of the “Japan-U.S. IT
Forum,” a framework between the defense authorities since
2002, and dispatching liaison officers to the U.S. Army’s
cyber educational institution.
**(c) Cooperation with Other Countries etc.**
Japan has held cyber dialogues with the respective defense
authorities of the United Kingdom, the North Atlantic Treaty
Organization (NATO), and others. Furthermore, Japan
has participated as an observer in cyber defense exercises


organized by NATO or the Cooperative Cyber Defence
Centre of Excellence (CCDCOE). In addition, the IT Forum
has been held between the defense authorities of Singapore,
Vietnam, and other countries to exchange views on
initiatives in the information communications area including
cybersecurity and current trends in technology.

**c. Development and Securing of Human Resources**
In order to strengthen the cyber defense capability of the
SDF, it is necessary to secure human resources who have
advanced and broad-ranging knowledge on cybersecurity.
To this end, the MOD/SDF will work to (1) implement
common cyber education;[46] (2) send personnel to study at
colleges, etc. in Japan and abroad; (3) ensure appropriate
treatment for security and IT human resources who work as
a bridge between highly professional human resources and
general administration departments in the MOD;[47] and (4)
consider the utilization of external human resources through
a public-private personnel exchange system to employ
people with practical experience in private companies as
well as contracts for service, for example.
**d. Contribution to the Whole-of-Government Approach**
Along with the National Police Agency, the Ministry of
Internal Affairs and Communications, the Ministry of
Economy, Trade and Industry, and the Ministry of Foreign
Affairs, the MOD, as one of the five government agencies
that are members of Cybersecurity Strategy Headquarters,
participates in cyber attack response training and personnel
exchanges, and provides information about cyber attacks,
etc. to the cross-sector initiatives led by the NISC as well
as sending personnel to the Cyber incident Mobile Assistant
Team (CYMAT).
The MOD is considering applying the knowledge and
experience of the SDF to penetration tests of the IT systems
of government ministries and agencies conducted by NISC.

domain.[50]

**(1) Enhancing the Ability to Appropriately Manage and**
**Coordinate the Use of Electromagnetic Spectrum**

In order to gain an advantage in warfare by using
electromagnetic spectrum proactively and effectively, it is
necessary to build capabilities to manage electromagnetic
spectrum by centrally grasping and coordinating wave
frequencies and status of use, and appropriately allocating
frequency resources to units, etc. in addition to electronic
warfare capabilities to ensure the use and effect of
electromagnetic spectrum while interfering with the use and
effect by an enemy.
For this purpose, the FY2019 budget includes (1)
establishment of “Electromagnetic Spectrum Policy Office”
in the Information and Communications Division, Bureau of
Defense Buildup Planning to enhance the planning function
for appropriate utilization of electromagnetic domain and


the function for coordination with other ministries and
agencies; and (2) establishment of “Electromagnetic Domain
Planning Section” in the C4 System Planning Division, C4
Systems Department in Joint Staff, for planning and study
pertaining to electromagnetic capabilities to ensure smooth
joint operation of the SDF. The new offices specialized
in electromagnetic domain will lead capacity building in
electromagnetic management.

See  Fig. 1-2-14 (Electronic Warfare Capabilities and
Electromagnetic Spectrum Management Capabilities [image])


**(2) Strengthening Information Collection and Analysis**
**Capabilities Related to Electromagnetic Spectrum, and**
**Building an Information Sharing Posture**

In order to gain an advantage in electromagnetic warfare,
it is important to gather and analyze information on
electromagnetic spectrum at all phases from peacetime to
armed contingencies and appropriately share the information
among SDF units.
To this end, the MOD/SDF plans to enhance
information gathering and analysis capabilities through
the procurement of electromagnetic information gathering
aircraft and ground-based SIGINT sensors, and establish
electromagnetic operation units to gather information
regarding electromagnetic spectrum as subordinate units
of the Ground Component Command. In order to share the


49 One of the attacks using electromagnetic waves is electromagnetic pulse (EMP) attacks, which place an extreme burden on electronics by generating instantaneous powerful
electromagnetic waves through nuclear explosions and other means leading to their malfunctioning or destruction. This type of attack would impact not just the defense fi eld but Japanese
people’s lives in general. The Government of Japan as a whole will deliberate on necessary countermeasures.

50 In addition, the MOD/SDF is advancing the multiplication of the communications network required for information sharing among the services, and conducting research in light of the
i i t f EMP t ti

information among SDF services while ensuring security
of the information, the SDF will promote the upgrade of
the JADGE system, the connection of each SDF service’s
systems, including the Defense Information Infrastructure
(DII) and the improvement of each SDF service’s data links.

**(3) Strengthening Capabilities to Neutralize Radar and**
**Communications of an Opponent who Intends to Invade**
**Japan**

Neutralizing use of electromagnetic spectrum, including
radar and communications of an opponent who intends to
invade Japan based on information gathering and analysis
in peacetime is effective as a means for the defense of Japan
so that even when inferiority exists in individual domains
such inferiority will be overcome and national defense
accomplished.
For this purpose, the SDF will proceed with capability
development through the procurement of fighters (F-35A)
superior in electronic countermeasures for self-protection
and network electronic warfare devices, installation of new
electronic warfare equipment on fighters (F-15), expansion
of the frequency band that utility aircraft (EP-3) can gather,
and enhancement of the capability of utility aircraft (UP-3D)
to simulate an electronic warfare environment.


**Chapter**


A Network electronic warfare device that can disable radar
or communications of opponents

Furthermore, the SDF will also swiftly proceed with
studies and R&D aimed at the procurement of (1) standoff
electronic warfare aircraft for jamming from outside of the
threat envelopes of the opponent, (2) high-power electronic
warfare devices, (3) high-power microwave devices that
can instantaneously disable a large number of drones, etc.,
and (4) Electronic Magnetic Pulse (EMP) bombs that can
instantaneously generate strong electromagnetic radiation to
disable electronic devices temporarily or permanently.


**4** **Response to Large-Scale Disasters**


The SDF has put in place arrangements for an initial
response to ensure that disaster relief operations are
conducted promptly. This is called “FAST-Force.”

See  Fig. III-1-2-15 (State of Readiness for Disaster Relief

[Standard]); Part II, Chapter 5, Section 2-4 (Disaster Relief and
Others)


1 Response to Large-Scale Disasters


When disasters such as natural disasters occur, the SDF

works in collaboration with local governments, engaged in
various activities such as the search and rescue of disaster
victims or ships or aircraft in distress, controlling floods,
offering medical treatment, preventing epidemics, supplying
water, and transporting personnel and goods.

**(1) Basic Concept**
Among the roles that must be served by Japan’s defense
capability as set forth in the NDPG, the idea of “(4) response
to large-scale disasters, etc.” is as follows.
In the event of a major disaster, all possible measures
will be taken to rapidly transport and deploy the SDF units
required and if necessary, to sustain the mobilization for
a long period. Not only will the SDF units respond to the
needs of affected residents and local authorities through care,
proper collaboration and cooperation, but they will also be
engaged with institutions concerned, local authorities and the
private sector to save lives, achieve urgent rehabilitation and
provide livelihood support.


**(2) Response by the MOD/SDF**
**a. Response to Natural Disasters, etc.**
**(a) Disaster Relief in Response to July 2018 Flooding Disaster**
In July 2018, record levels of rain fell across a wide swath
of Japan from east to west, causing rivers to breach their
banks and multiple large scale flooding and landslide
events. In response to disaster relief requests from the
governors of Kyoto Prefecture, Hyogo Prefecture, Okayama
Prefecture, Hiroshima Prefecture, Yamaguchi Prefecture,
Kochi Prefecture, Ehime Prefecture and Fukuoka Prefecture,
around 300 liaison officers were sent to coordinate closely
with local governments in up to 74 locations to save lives,
rescuing stranded residents, supplying water, providing
bathing facilities and meals, distributing goods, preventing
water intrusion, clearing roads and removing rubble. As part

of assistance, the MOD used a private boat Hakuou under
a contract with the ministry to provide bathing facilities
in Hiroshima and Okayama Prefectures. In addition, SDF
Ready Reserve Personnel were called up with 311 SDF Ready
Reserve Personnel engaging in daily support of survivors
at its peak. This mission involved approximately 33,100
personnel, 28 boats (including the private boat Hakuou) and
38 aircraft. In total, 2,284 people were rescued, 18,973 tons
of water were supplied, 94,119 people were provided with
bathing facilities, and 20,590 meals were provided.
**(b) Disaster Relief in Response to the Hokkaido Eastern Iburi**
**Earthquake in 2018**
In September 2018, a magnitude 6.7 earthquake with
epicenter at the central eastern part of Iburi, Hokkaido
occurred, which caused landslides and a massive blackout
in Abira, Atsuma and Mukawa towns, and other places. In
response to disaster relief requests from the governor of
Hokkaido, liaison officers were sent to closely coordinate
with local governments in up to 29 locations to save lives,
clear roads, supply water, provide bathing facilities and
meals as well as transport goods including equipment for
restoration of power supply, and install water gauges and
remove driftwood, etc. to prevent collapse of Atsuma dam
due to precipitation and sediment. In addition, the private
boat Hakuou under a contract with the ministry was used
to provide bathing facilities in Tomakomai City, Hokkaido.
Furthermore, SDF Ready Reserve Personnel were called up
with 251 SDF Ready Reserve Personnel engaging in relief
activities at its peak. This mission involved approximately
25,100 personnel, 9 vessels (including the private boat
Hakuou) and 46 aircraft. In total, 46 people were rescued,
1,186 tons of water was supplied, 24,091 people were
provided with bathing facilities, and 166,963 meals were
provided.
In this disaster relief mission, drones for disaster were
used for the first time. They were used for speedy collection
of information in places and directions where human access

relief units.
Furthermore, while many hospitals did not function due
to massive blackout or other reasons, SDF Sapporo Hospital,
which had been rebuilt with a design of a disaster resilient
hospital (opened in 2015) was able to maintain its functions
intact and carry out treatment just after the disaster.
**(c) Disaster Relief in Response to Water Supply Relief**
In October 2018, water supply failure continued in SuoOshima Town, Yamaguchi Prefecture, because a water pipe
fell off when a foreign vessel struck Oshima Ohashi bridge


-----

In response to disaster relief requests from the governor of
the prefecture, the SDF provided relief supplies of purified
and other water. These missions engaged around 500
personnel, some 170 vehicles, generated approximately 94
tons of water, and supplied approximately 490 tons of water
in total.
**(d) Disaster Relief in Response to Swine Fever Outbreak**
Between December 2018 and the end of June 2019, the
occurrence of swine fever was confirmed in Gifu, Aichi,
and Nagano Prefectures. As prompt epidemic prevention
measures, including slaughter of hogs, were required, the
SDF assisted with the slaughter and other measures in
response to disaster relief requests from the governors of the
prefectures. These missions engaged around 8,000 personnel
and some 1,200 vehicles.
**(e) Disaster Relief in Response to Forest Fire**
Over the period from July 2018 to the end of June 2019, local
authorities conducted firefighting operations against fighting
forest fires in Nagano Prefecture, Gunma Prefecture, Saitama
Prefecture, Wakayama Prefecture, Tochigi Prefecture,
Hiroshima Prefecture, Shizuoka Prefecture, Fukushima
Prefecture, Aomori Prefecture, Yamagata Prefecture,
Hokkaido, Tokyo, and Kochi Prefecture but were unable to
settle the situation despite their efforts. Based on requests
issued by the governors of these prefectures, the SDF
contributed to aerial firefighting and other resources. The


SDF dispatches were conducted 21 times in total, including a
total of some 9,400 personnel, around 700 vehicles and some
230 aircraft. Approximately 4,300 tons of water was applied
on 1,000 occasions.

See Fig. III-1-2-16 (Record of Disaster Relief [FY2018]); Reference

See

21 (Record of Disaster Relief [Past Five Years])


**b. Transportation of Emergency Patients**
The SDF uses its aircraft to transport emergency patients
from isolated islands and remote areas with insufficient
medical facilities (transportation of emergency patients). In
FY2018, out of a total of 443 cases of disaster relief, 334
cases involved the transportation of emergency patients, with
dispatches to remote islands such as the Southwestern Islands
(Okinawa and Kagoshima Prefectures), the Ogasawara
Islands (Tokyo), and remote islands of Nagasaki Prefecture
representing the majority of such cases.
In addition, the SDF carries out sea rescues upon requests
by the Japan Coast Guard on such occasions as transport of
emergency patients from vessels navigating areas of ocean far
from the mainland where the aircraft of other organizations
are unable to respond, due to reasons including a short flight
range and emergencies of vessels due to incidents such as
fire, flooding or capsizing. Furthermore, the SDF conducts
wide-area medical transport operations for serious-case

**Earthquake**

**Leading Private Ryosuke Hariyamaza, Gunner, 2nd Firing Battery, 1st Artillery Battalion, 7th Artillery Regiment**
**(Chitose Ciry, Hokkaido)**
During disaster relief following the 2018 Hokkaido Eastern Iburi Earthquake, I participated in rescue activities conducted
at Yoshino District, Atsuma Town, which was the territory of my battalion.
I had never been a part of disaster relief before and the only knowledge and images I had were from television and
newspapers. Arriving at the disaster area, I saw cruel sites beyond my imagination and felt the importance of SDF missions.
In the area of our battalion, houses were swept away dozens of meters by a landslide accompanying the earthquake. On
piled up fallen trees and soil we searched for the missing by hand
following clues of scattered beds and clothes.
The nightlong rescue in the rain in a highly time-sensitive
situation was very severe but we were able to complete the
mission with the desire to rescue people as soon as possible
and the strength and energy we had cultivated through our daily
training.
Through the disaster relief activities, I strongly felt people’s
expectations of the SDF and a sense of mission to meet the
expectations. I will continue to push forward with my duties with
pride as SDF personnel. Atsuma Town rescue activities (Sept. 8, 2018)

**e. Exercises Involving the SDF**
In order to respond to large-scale and various other disasters
in a speedy and appropriate manner, the SDF carries
out various disaster prevention drills, and also actively
participates in disaster prevention drills organized by the
Japanese Government or local governments and is seeking to
ensure cooperation with various ministries and agencies, and
local governments.
**(a) Joint Exercise for Rescue (JXR)**
In June 2018, the SDF conducted a comprehensive disaster
drill including a field exercise in preparation for an
earthquake directly hitting the Tokyo area. In addition, in
May 2019, the SDF carried out a disaster drill concerning
its command and staff activities and its coordination with
relevant organizations, U.S. Forces, etc. in the event of
occurrence of an earthquake directly hitting the Tokyo area
during the Tokyo 2020 Olympic and Paralympic Games. In
this manner, the SDF carried out initiatives to maintain and
enhance the SDF’s earthquake response capability.
**(b) Tomodachi Rescue Exercise (TREX) Joint Disaster**
**Response Exercise with U.S. Forces**
In October 2018, joint exercises were held with U.S. Forces
stationed in Japan in the scenario of a Nankai Trench
earthquake. The purpose of the exercise was to maintain
and enhance earthquake disaster handling capabilities in
collaboration between the SDF and U.S. forces and to
strengthen cooperation with relevant local authorities.
**(c) Remote Island Disaster Relief Exercise (RIDEX)**
In September 2018, the SDF participated in a general disaster
prevention training planned and organized by Okinawa
Prefecture and conducted a field training exercise to deal
with sudden large-scale disasters in a remote island to
maintain as well as enhance the SDF’s ability to respond to
disasters in remote islands and strengthen collaboration with
relevant local authorities.

mobile medical units in certain occasions.
Furthermore, in FY2018, the SDF carried out 49 dispatches
of firefighting support, with 37 cases responding to fire in the
areas near SDF facilities.
**c. The MOD/SDF Response to Nuclear Disaster**
In order to respond to nuclear disasters, the MOD/SDF has
formulated “The SDF Nuclear Disaster Response Plan.”
The SDF also participates in general nuclear disaster
prevention drills jointly implemented by the government,
local governments, and nuclear operators, to confirm the
effectiveness of municipal governments’ evacuation plan
and to strengthen cooperation with relevant agencies in a
nuclear disaster emergency. Moreover, since October 2014,
SDF personnel (five personnel as of April 1, 2019) were
transferred (on temporary assignment) to a section in charge
of nuclear disaster prevention within the Cabinet Office
as part of an effort to enhance the effectiveness of nuclear
disaster response capabilities.
**d. Formulating Plans for Responding to Various Disasters**
Formulating Plans for Responding to Various Disasters in the
event of the occurrence of various disasters, the MOD/SDF
will take all possible measures such as swift transportation
and deployment of sufficiently sized units in their initial
response. By establishing a rotating staffing posture based
on a joint operational approach, the MOD/ SDF will ensure
that it is able to sustain a well-prepared condition for a longterm response. In doing so, the MOD/SDF will fully take
into account the lessons learned from the Great East Japan
Earthquake and other disasters.
The MOD/SDF formulates various contingency plans
for responses to large-scale earthquakes, which are under
consideration at the Central Disaster Management Council,
based on the Ministry of Defense Disaster Prevention Plan to
respond to such earthquakes.

agencies.
They also took part in the Ministry of Defense Disaster
Management Headquarters drill, the comprehensive disaster
prevention drills on Disaster Prevention Day, and more.[51]

**f. Collaboration with Local Governments and Other Relevant**
**Organizations**
It is important for the MOD/SDF to strengthen collaboration
with local governments and other relevant organizations
under normal circumstances for the purpose of conducting
disaster relief operations smoothly. For this reason, the SDF
implements various measures including: (1) Assignment of
the post of Liaison Officer for Civil Protection and Disaster
Management (administrative official) at the SDF Provincial
Cooperation Offices; (2) Temporary assignment of SDF
officers to the department in charge of disaster prevention
at the Tokyo Metropolitan Government, and mutual
exchange between administrative officials of both the GSDF
Middle Army and Hyogo Prefectural Government; and (3)
Recommendation of retired SDF personnel with knowledge
in disaster prevention in accordance with requests from local
governments. As of the end of March 2019, as many as 495
retired SDF personnel are working in disaster prevention and
other sections in 348 local governments in 46 prefectures
throughout the country. Such cooperation in human resources
is a very effective way of strengthening collaboration between
the MOD/SDF and local governments, and its efficacy was
confirmed through the experiences of the Great East Japan
Earthquake and other disasters. In particular, each GSDF
regional Army establishes a forum for interaction with senior
directors for crisis management and other officials from local
governments and share information and exchange opinions
to strengthen collaboration with those local governments.
In the event of a disaster, liaison officers are sent quickly
and effectively from the units to the local municipalities in
order to ensure smooth coordination.[52]

2 Response to Rescue and Transport of Japanese
Nationals Overseas, etc.


**(1) Basic Concept**
In the event of natural disasters, insurgencies, and other
emergencies overseas, the Minister of Defense can order
SDF units to rescue or transport Japanese nationals and other
people overseas upon request from the Minister for Foreign
Affairs to guard, rescue or transport Japanese nationals
overseas, etc. and upon subsequent consultations with the
Minister, on the basis of Article 84-3 (rescue Japanese
nationals overseas, etc.) or Article 84-4 (transport of Japanese
nationals overseas, etc.) of the SDF Law.

**(2) Initiatives of the MOD/SDF**
For prompt and appropriate implementation of rescue
or transport of Japanese nationals overseas, the SDF is
prepared to dispatch its units swiftly. Specifically, the SDF
maintains operational readiness, with the GSDF designating


51 In addition, the following drills were conducted and participated in, in 2018: 1) government tabletop drills, 2) the Nuclear Energy Disaster Prevention Drill, 3) the large tsunami disaster
prevention drill, 4) the drill for medical treatment activities following a large-scale earthquake, 5) a drill related to the Comprehensive Disaster Prevention Drill of Nine Prefectural and City
Governments, 6) a drill related to the joint disaster drill among the Kinki prefectures, 7) comprehensive disaster prevention drills conducted by local governments or other bodies.

52 Based on the “Examination Report on the Initial Response to the Heavy Rain in July 2018” (November 2018), in order to rescue and support more victims in the event of a large-scale
disaster and considering possible confusion of the local authorities, the MOD/SDF will not only wait for request from the authorities but also actively propose specific support activities by
the SDF.

53 In recent years, the Heavy Rain in July 2018, Typhoon No.21 in 2018, Hokkaido Eastern Iburi Earthquake in 2018 and other natural disasters caused function loss of important
infrastructures necessary for living and economic activities of the people, which had a major effect on the activities. Learning from the experience, the Emergency Countermeasures
stipulate physical and non-physical measures that individual ministries and agencies should implement intensively for the period of three years from the perspective of maintaining

Therefore, the MOD will take seismic reinforcement measures for around 10 facilities, countermeasures against deterioration for around 40 facilities, and measures to enhance power supplying capability for around 30 facilities.|By FY2020|
|Emergency measures for SDF equipment related to disaster prevention|As it is urgently necessary to develop equipment required for the SDF’s relief activities upon a disaster from the perspective of preventing functional failures due to deterioration and of strengthening such relief activities, the MOD will take emergency measures for securing necessary equipment, communication devices, and vehicles for camps nationwide where old dysfunctional equipment was found.|By FY2020|


a helicopter unit and leading transport unit personnel, the
MSDF designating vessels such as transport ships (including
ship-based aircraft), and the ASDF designating airlift units
and personnel for dispatch.
Since these activities require close coordination among
the GSDF, MSDF and ASDF, the MOD/SDF constantly
conducts joint exercises. In September 2018, the exercise for
the rescue of Japanese nationals overseas was conducted in
Djibouti with the aim of enhancing overseas deployment and
activity capabilities and strengthening cooperation between
the SDF and the U.S. Forces. In December 2018, the SDF
carried out an exercise in Japan for the rescue of Japanese
nationals overseas to practice the whole process of the
actions and coordination with related organizations for the
rescue in order to enhance integrated operational capabilities
and strengthen coordination with related organizations.
Furthermore, in January and February 2019, the MOD/SDF
also took the opportunity of the annual multilateral exercise
Cobra Gold taking place in Thailand to conduct an exercise
for the series of activities to protect Japanese nationals
overseas in cooperation with the Ministry of Foreign Affairs
and the Embassy of Japan in Thailand. With the participation
of Japanese nationals overseas, the exercise strengthened the
collaboration between the MOD/SDF and the Ministry of
Foreign Affairs.
The MOD/SDF has conducted the transportation of
Japanese nationals in four cases.
Responding to the kidnapping of foreigners and Japanese
in Iraq, 10 Japanese evacuated to Kuwait by an ASDF
C-130H plane in April 2004. In January 2013, a government
aircraft was deployed to bring seven Japanese nationals
and the remains of a further nine nationals back to Japan
following the kidnapping in Algeria. With respect to the
terrorist attack in Dhaka, Bangladesh, which occurred in
July 2016, the bodies of Japanese victims (seven nationals),

their families, and other involved parties were transported
to Japan. In relation to the deterioration of the situation in
South Sudan in July of the same year, the ASDF transport
aircraft C-130H transported four embassy staff from Juba to
Djibouti.

**Starting Operation of a New Government Aircraft**

With the retirement of the B-747 that had been used as the government aircraft, the MOD decided to introduce a B-777 as
a new government aircraft in August 2014 and started its operation in April 2019.
Since 1993, when the B-747 started its operation as the first government aircraft, it was used for overseas visits by
leading figures, including their Majesties the Emperor and Empress, their Imperial Highnesses the Crown Prince and
Princess, and 15 Prime Ministers from Miyazawa to Abe. The aircraft was also used for UN PKO, emergency international
disaster relief operations and other international cooperation activities by the MOD and for TJNO (Transportation of
Japanese Nationals Overseas).
The new government aircraft B-777 has better fuel efficiency and a longer maximum range compared with the B-747.
Its interior was also changed completely for more comfortable flight experience. It has become more environment-friendly
and more comfortable aircraft.
A government aircraft that carries the leading figures of Japan is indispensable for “ Diplomacy that takes a panoramic
perspective of the world map.” It is also an important aircraft for security cooperation of the MOD. The realization of peace
and security in Japan through the creation of a desirable security environment for Japan is extremely important. The MOD
will continue to support these activities through the operation of the government aircraft.

**Japan-U.S. Alliance**
### 2


The National Defense Program Guidelines for FY2019
and beyond (NDPG)[1] states that the Japan-U.S. Security
Arrangements based on the Japan-U.S. Security Treaty,
together with Japan’s own national defense architecture,
constitute a cornerstone for Japan’s national security, and
that the Japan-U.S. Alliance, with the Japan-U.S. Security
Arrangements as its core, plays a significant role for peace,
stability and prosperity of not only Japan but also the IndoPacific region and the international community.
The NDPG explains that, as inter-sate competitions
prominently emerge, it has become all the more important for
Japan’s national security to further strengthen relationship
with the United States, with whom Japan shares universal
values and strategic interests, and that the United States
also views that cooperation with its allies has become more
important.
On that basis, the NDPG provides that, while the
Japan-U.S. Alliance has been reinforced through activities
including those that were made possible by the Legislation
for Peace and Security, Japan needs to further enhance the
Alliance through efforts under the “Guidelines for JapanUS Defense Cooperation” in order to achieve its national
defense objective as security environment surrounding
Japan becomes more testing and uncertain at remarkably fast
speeds.
At the same time, the NDPG provides that, in further

strengthening the Japan-U.S. Alliance, it is an essential
premise that Japan strengthens its own defense capability on
its own accord and initiative. Fulfilling this premise, Japan
needs to press ahead with efforts such as: bolstering the
ability of the Alliance to deter and counter threats; enhancing
and expanding cooperation in a wide range of areas; and
steadily implementing measures concerning the stationing of
the U.S. Forces in Japan (USFJ).
This chapter explains activities related to the enhancement
of the Japan-U.S. Alliance while taking account of the

concept of the NDPG.


However, it is difficult even for the United States to
guarantee its security on its own. Much more than that, it
would be difficult for Japan to ensure its national security
solely through its unilateral efforts given its population,
land, and economy. Moreover, such a strategy would not
necessarily contribute to regional stability.
Consequently, Japan has maintained its peace and
security, centered on the Security Arrangements with the

world s dominant military power, the United States, with
which it shares basic values such as democracy, the rule of
law, respect for human rights, and a capitalist economy as
well as an interest in maintaining the peace and security of
the world, and has strong economic ties.
Specifically, Japan and the United States will take bilateral
action in the event of an armed attack against Japan, based
on Article 5 of the Japan-U.S. Security Treaty, and Japan
will provide facilities and areas for the U.S. Forces, based on
Article 6 of the treaty. If a nation plans to attack Japan, the
attacker must be prepared to confront not only the defense
capability of the Self-Defense Forces (SDF), but also the
overwhelming military strength of the United States, due to
the U.S. obligation to defend Japan in the event of an armed
attack. As a result, the opposing nation clearly recognizes
that it will suffer grievously if it carries out an invasion, and
such desires will be abandoned at the planning stage. In other
words, this serves as deterrence against attacks.
Japan intends to create a seamless posture and secure its
peace and security by effectively utilizing the deterrence
capabilities of the U.S. military together with Japan’s own
national defense architecture.

2 Maintenance of Peace and Stability in the Region
surrounding Japan


Article 6 of the Japan-U.S. Security Treaty states that
contributing to the security of Japan and the maintenance of
international peace and security in the Far East is the purpose
of the use of facilities and areas by the USFJ. This provision
is based on the recognition that the security of Japan is
closely tied to the peace and security of the Far East region
to which Japan belongs.
In the regions surrounding Japan, there are many states and
the like with massive military power, including some states
that retain nuclear weapons or continue nuclear development.
In addition, uncertainty over the existing order is increasing
due to changes in the balance of power. The so-called grayzone situations harbor the risk of rapidly developing into
graver situations without showing clear indications.
In such a security environment, the military presence of
USFJ provides deterrence against unexpected contingencies
caused by various security issues or destabilizing factors, not
only protecting the interests of Japan and the United States
but also providing a great sense of security to the nations in
the region and thus fulfilling a role as public goods.
Also, the close bonds of cooperation based on the JapanU.S. Security Arrangements constitute the foundation of
the United States’ commitment to the peace and stability
of the region surrounding Japan. These arrangements,
complemented by the alliances established between the


United States and other countries in the region such as the
Republic of Korea (ROK), Australia, Thailand, and the
Philippines, and also by the friendly relations developed with
other countries, play an indispensable role in maintaining the
peace and stability of the region.

3 Responding to Global Issues


The Japan-U.S. Security Arrangements are the foundation
for a comprehensive and friendly cooperative relationship
between Japan and the United States, not only in defense but
also in a wide range of areas, including politics, economy,
and society.
The Japan-U.S. Alliance, with these security arrangements
at its core, also forms the axis of Japan’s foreign policy. It
contributes to Japan’s ability to implement positive efforts
to maintain the peace and security of the international
community, including the promotion of multinational
security dialogue and cooperation, and cooperation with the
United Nations.
Currently, we are confronted with global security
challenges that are difficult for any single country to tackle
alone, including risks concerning stable use of the seas,
outer space and cyberspace, the acts of piracy, proliferation
of weapons of mass destruction and ballistic missiles, and
international terrorism, and it is important for countries to
work together from peacetime. The strong bonds forged
between Japan and the United States are also playing an
important role in the efforts implemented by Japan to
effectively respond to such challenges.
In particular, under the Japan-U.S. Security Arrangements,
the SDF and the U.S. Forces are working together in peacetime
in a variety of areas to strengthen their cooperation. This close
coordination lays the foundation for various forms of global
collaboration such as antipiracy, undertaken by the SDF and
the U.S. Forces, and leads to enhancement of the operational
effectiveness of the Japan-U.S. Security Arrangements.
The peace and prosperity of the international community
are closely linked to those of Japan. Accordingly, by advancing
initiatives for resolving global issues in cooperation with the
United States, which has remarkable operational capabilities,
Japan will be able to further ensure its security and prosperity.

**2** **Background to the Strengthening of the Alliance**


Since the conclusion of the Japan-U.S. Security Treaty in
1960, Japan and the United States have built a robust alliance
based on democratic ideals, respect for human rights, and the
rule of law and common interests.
During the Cold War era, the Japan-U.S. Security
Arrangements ensured the safety of Japan as a country of
liberal democracy and contributed to the peace and stability
in the region, including the formulation of the Guidelines
for Japan-U.S. Defense Cooperation (“Guidelines”) in 1978
with a focus on responses to an armed attack on Japan.
Following the end of the Cold War, the leaders of Japan and
the United States announced the Japan-U.S. Joint Declaration
on Security in 1996, reaffirming the importance of the JapanU.S. Alliance in light of the state of affairs in the Asia-Pacific
region following the Cold War. Upon the Declaration, the
final report was compiled at the Special Action Committee
on Okinawa (SACO) at the end of that year. As part of
the promotion of cooperative relations presented in the
Declaration, the Japan-United States Security Consultative
Committee (SCC) (“2+2” Meeting) held in the following
year (1997) approved the aforementioned 1997 Guidelines[2]
and expanded cooperation to responses in situations in
areas surrounding Japan in light of changes in the security
environment, such as the end of the Cold War.
In light of further changes to the security environment due
to the 9/11 terrorist attacks in 2001 and the proliferation of
weapons of mass destruction, following the “2+2” Meeting in
December 2002, Japan and the United States held workinglevel and other consultations as a part of bilateral strategic
dialogue on security from the perspective of how to make
the Japan-U.S. Alliance’s capacity more effective to adapt to
the changing times.
As a result of a number of these Japan-U.S. consultations,
the direction of the Japan-U.S. Alliance was arranged in three
stages. These stages are: confirmation of common strategic
objectives to both countries, including enhancing peace and
stability of the Asia-Pacific region (first stage) in February
2005; announcement of the results of the examination of the
roles, missions, and capabilities of Japan and the United States
for accomplishing the common strategic objectives (second
stage) in October 2005; and finalization of the United StatesJapan Roadmap for Realignment Implementation, a program
for implementing specific measures for the realignment of
USFJ, (third stage) in May 2006.

See Reference 22 (United States-Japan Roadmap for Realignment
Implementation [tentative translation])


Japan and the United States at the “2+2” Meeting in May 2007
reconfirmed and updated their common strategic objectives.
In February 2009, the two countries signed the Agreement
between the Government of Japan and the Government of the
United States of America Concerning the Implementation of
the Relocation of III Marine Expeditionary Force Personnel
and Their Dependents from Okinawa to Guam (the Guam
International Agreement), which entered into force in May
2009.
At the “2+2” Meeting in June 2011, the two countries
reviewed and revalidated their common strategic objectives
set forth in the Joint Statements of the previous “2+2”
Meetings, including maintenance of maritime security
domain by defending the principle of freedom of navigation
and maintenance of bilateral cooperation with respect to
protection of and access to outer space and cyberspace, and
discussed a diverse range of areas, including an expansion of
information sharing and joint Intelligence, Surveillance, and
Reconnaissance (ISR) activities.
In the Joint Statement of the “2+2” Meeting in April 2012,
Japan and the United States announced the decision to adjust
the plans outlined in the United States-Japan Roadmap for
Realignment Implementation (Realignment Roadmap) of
2006, considering significant progress on the realignment of
the U.S. Forces stationed in Japan since the “2+2” Meeting
in June 2011 as well as the security environment in the AsiaPacific region.

See Reference 23 (Joint Statement of the Security Consultative
Committee (2+2) (tentative translation) (April 27, 2012)


**Chapter**


Since the formulation of the 1997 Guidelines, various
issues and destabilizing factors have emerged, and become
more visible and aggravated in the security environment
surrounding Japan; such as more active military activities of
neighboring countries, new threats including international
terrorist organizations and risks against the stable use of
global commons such as oceans, outer space and cyberspace.
In addition, the activities of the SDF have expanded to
a global scale, as exemplified by anti-piracy activities,
peacekeeping operations (PKO), and international disaster
relief activities. As a result, it had become necessary for the
manner of Japan-U.S. defense cooperation to be adapted to
these changes in the security environment and the expansion
of the SDF’s activities and missions.
Based on this background, both governments decided
at the “2+2” Meeting in October 2013 to revise the 1997


The 1997 Guidelines define the roles of Japan and the United States, and the cooperation of the two countries under three categories: (1) under normal circumstances, (2) in response to

**3** **Content of the Guidelines for Japan-U.S. Defense Cooperation**


The Guidelines, which replace the 1997 Guidelines, update
the general framework and policy direction for the roles and
missions of the two countries and manifest a strategic vision
for a more robust Alliance and greater shared responsibilities
by modernizing the Alliance and enhancing its deterrence
and response capabilities in all phases, from peacetime to
contingencies.

See Reference 24 (The Guidelines for Japan-U.S. Defense
Cooperation [April 27, 2015] [tentative translation])

Fig. III-2-1-2 (Outline of the Guidelines for Japan-U.S. Defense
Cooperation)

1 Defense Cooperation and the Aim of the Guidelines


The Guidelines newly specified the matters to be emphasized
in security and defense cooperation. The objectives of the
new Guidelines are retained in line with the approach of the
1997 Guidelines.
⃝ In order to ensure Japan’s peace and security under
any circumstances, from peacetime to contingencies,


and to promote a stable, peaceful, and prosperous AsiaPacific region and beyond, bilateral security and defense
cooperation will emphasize:

-  seamless, robust, flexible, and effective bilateral
responses;

-  synergy across the two governments’ national security
policies;

-  a whole-of-government Alliance approach;

-  cooperation with regional and other partners, as well as
international organizations; and

-  the global nature of the Japan-U.S. Alliance
⃝ The two governments will maintain their individual
defense postures based on their national security policies.
The United States will continue to extend deterrence to
Japan through the full range of capabilities, including
U.S. nuclear forces. The United States also will continue
to forward deploy combat-ready forces in the Asia-Pacific
region and maintain the ability to reinforce those forces
rapidly.
⃝ The Guidelines provide the general framework and


-----

policy direction for the roles and missions of Japan and
the United States, as well as ways of cooperation and
coordination.
⃝ The Guidelines promote domestic and international
understanding of the significance of the Japan-U.S.
Alliance.

2 Basic Premises and Principles


The basic premises and principles maintain the approaches
of the 1997 Guidelines as described below:
⃝ The rights and obligations under the Japan-U.S.
Security Treaty and its related arrangements will remain
unchanged.
⃝ All actions and activities undertaken under the Guidelines
will be consistent with international law.
⃝ All actions and activities undertaken by Japan and the
United States will be in accordance with their respective
constitutions, laws and regulations then in effect, and
basic positions on national security policy. Japan will
conduct actions and activities in accordance with its basic
positions, such as the maintenance of its exclusively
national defense-oriented policy and its three non-nuclear
principles.
⃝ The Guidelines do not obligate either government to take
legislative, budgetary, administrative, or other measures,
nor do the Guidelines create legal rights or obligations for
either government. Since the objective of the Guidelines,
however, is to establish an effective framework for
bilateral cooperation, the two governments are expected
to reflect in an appropriate way the results of these efforts,
based on their own judgment, in their specific policies and
measures.


the standing mechanism utilizable from peacetime; (2) it can
be utilized for large-scale natural disasters in Japan as well
as for cooperation in the Asia-Pacific region and globally;
and (3) it enables whole-of-government coordination while
ensuring the involvement of relevant Japanese and U.S.
organizations. These characteristics enable the Japanese and
U.S. Governments to respond appropriately and promptly
when the need for coordination arises. For example,
in the event of a largescale natural disaster in Japan, it
would require a diversity of coordination in the policy and
operational aspects related to activities of the SDF and the
U.S. Forces. The utilization of this mechanism makes it
possible to conduct close and appropriate coordination with
the involvement of relevant Japanese and U.S. organizations
at various levels.
Since the establishment of the mechanism, Japan and the
United States have been utilizing the mechanism to coordinate
closely, including in response to the 2016 Kumamoto
Earthquake, the ballistic missile launches by North Korea,
and Chinese activities in the waters and airspace around the
Senkaku Islands.

See Fig. III-2-1-3 (The Framework of Alliance Coordination

See

Mechanism [ACM])


**Chapter**


**(2) Enhanced Operational Coordination**
Based on the Guidelines, the Japanese and U.S. Governments
recognize the importance of collocating operational
coordination functions. The SDF and the U.S. Forces will
exchange personnel to ensure robust information sharing, to
facilitate coordination and to support international activities.

**(3) Establishment of the Bilateral Planning Mechanism**
Based on the Guidelines, the Japanese and U.S. Governments
established the Bilateral Planning Mechanism (BPM)
in November 2015 for the purpose of implementing the
development of bilateral plans in peacetime in line with the
Guidelines in order to enable effective bilateral responses to
contingencies relevant to Japan’s peace and security.
In the development of bilateral plans, this mechanism
performs the functions of ensuring Ministerial-level
directions and supervision and the involvement of relevant
government ministries and agencies, as well as conducting
coordination for various forms of Japan-U.S. cooperation
conducive to the development of bilateral plans. The two
governments will conduct bilateral planning through this
mechanism.

See Fig. III-2-1-4 (The Framework of the Bilateral Planning
Mechanism [BMP])


3 Strengthened Coordination within the Alliance


**(1) Establishment of the Alliance Coordination Mechanism**
In November 2015, the Japanese and U.S. Governments
established the Alliance Coordination Mechanism (ACM) in
order to address seamlessly and effectively any situation that
affects Japan’s peace and security or any other situation that
may require an Alliance response.
Based on the framework shown in Fig. III-2-1-3, this
mechanism coordinates policy and operational aspects
related to activities conducted by the SDF and the U.S.
Forces in all phases from peacetime to contingencies. This
mechanism also contributes to timely information sharing
as well as to the development and maintenance of common
situational awareness.
The characteristics of the mechanism include that (1) it is

The Guidelines define that Japan and the United States will
work on a variety of measures from peacetime, including
ISR activities, air and missile defense, maritime security,
training and exercises, asset protection, and logistics support,
and cooperate in such activities as response to a large-scale
disaster in Japan in order to seamlessly ensure Japan’s peace

1 Various Policy Consultations


Japan and the United States have maintained close
coordination at multiple levels, including the summit level
and ministerial level, and have continually strengthened and
expanded cooperative relations for the peace, stability and
prosperity of not only the two countries but also the entire
international community, including the Indo-Pacific region.
Close policy consultations on security are conducted
through diplomatic channels as well as between officials in
charge of defense and foreign affairs at multiple levels in the
Governments of Japan and the United States through meetings
such as the Japan-United States SCC (“2+2” Meeting),
the Security Subcommittee (SSC) and the Subcommittee
for Defense Cooperation (SDC). As the framework for
ministerial consultations among the top officials in charge
of defense and foreign affairs of the two countries, the SCC
(“2+2” Meeting) represents such policy consultations. The
SCC functions as an important consultative panel to discuss

issues related to Japan-U.S. cooperation in the area of
security.
In addition, the Ministry of Defense (MOD) organizes
Japan-U.S. defense ministerial meetings between the
Japanese Minister of Defense and the U.S. Secretary of
Defense as necessary where discussions are made with a
focus on the defense policies of the respective governments
and defense cooperation. Furthermore, the Japanese State
Minister of Defense and the U.S. Deputy Secretary of
Defense work together, and MOD officials, including the
Administrative Vice-Minister of Defense, the Chief of
Staff of the Joint Staff, the Vice-Minister of Defense for
International Affairs, and the Chiefs of Staff of the SDF,
have working-level meetings when necessary and exchange
information with the U.S. Department of Defense (DoD) and
others under the Japan-U.S. Security Arrangements.
The sharing of information and views at every
opportunity and level between Japan and the United States
is undoubtedly conducive to the increased credibility of

For these purposes, Japan will further deepen various
operational cooperation and policy coordination with the
United States. In particular, Japan will expand and deepen

**1** **Cooperation in Space and Cyber Domains**

1 Cooperation on Space


With regard to cooperation on space, based on the agreement
at the Japan-U.S. Summit Meeting in November 2009 to
promote cooperation in the area of space security as part
of initiatives to deepen the Japan-U.S. Alliance, the two
countries have periodically been working together to discuss
how they should cooperate in the future, such as the holding
of the 1st Japan-U.S. Space Security Dialogue in September
2010 with the participation of relevant ministries and
agencies.
Furthermore, the Japan-U.S. Summit Meeting in April
2012 decided to deepen the space-based partnership for civil
and security purposes and to create a whole-of government
comprehensive dialogue on space, enabling relevant
ministries and agencies to hold the 1st whole-of government
Japan-U.S. Comprehensive Dialogue on Space in March
2013. The two countries have been sharing information on
their respective space policies and discussing plans for future
cooperation on a regular basis.
Moreover, based on the instructions given by the JapanU.S. Defense Ministerial Meeting of April 2015, the two
countries established the Space Cooperation Working Group
(SCWG) to further promote the cooperation among bilateral
defense authorities in the area of space. The SCWG has
held five meetings in total since its establishment in October
2015 (the most recent meeting was in January 2019). Going
forward, Japan and the United States will leverage this
working group to deepen discussions in a wide variety of
areas, including (1) promoting space policy dialogue, (2)
reinforcing information sharing, (3) working together to


cooperation in: space and cyber domains; comprehensive air
and missile defense; bilateral training and exercises; bilateral
ISR operations; and bilateral flexible deterrent options. Japan
will also promote development and update of bilateral plans
and deepen the Extended Deterrence Dialogue. In addition,
Japan will even more actively conduct activities such as
logistic support for U.S. force activities and protection of
U.S. ships and aircraft.

2 Cooperation on Cyberspace


Concerning cooperation on cyberspace, the Cyber Defense
Policy Working Group (CDPWG) was established in October
2013 as a framework between the MOD and the DoD to
discuss a broad range of professional and concrete issues,
including the sharing of information at the policy level,
human resources development, and technical cooperation.
The Guidelines released in April 2015 and the CDPWG

Joint Statement published in May 2015 cited the prompt and
appropriate establishment of an information sharing structure
and the protection of the critical infrastructure upon which
the SDF and the U.S. Forces depend to accomplish their
missions as examples of cooperation between the Japanese
and U.S. Governments. In addition, as part of cooperation
between the SDF and the U.S. Forces, the securing of the
resiliency of their respective networks and systems and the
implementation of educational exchanges and joint exercises
were also cited. Japan and the United States will further
accelerate bilateral cyber defense cooperation in line with
the direction presented by the Guidelines and the CDPWG
Joint Statement.

**2** **Comprehensive Air and Missile Defense**


Regarding the response to airborne threats coming to Japan,
such as ballistic missiles, cruise missiles and aircraft, JapanU.S. bilateral response capabilities have been enhanced by
sharing operation information and establishing response
procedures.
For the repeated ballistic missile launches by North Korea,
Japan and the United States have conducted coordinated
responses utilizing the ACM. Also, in the systems and

**3** **Bilateral Training and Exercises**


Bilateral training in peacetime not only contributes greatly
to maintaining and enhancing the Japan-U.S. bilateral
response capabilities by improving interoperability including
mutual understanding of tactics and mutual communication,
but is also beneficial for improving tactical skills on each
side. In particular, the knowledge and techniques that the
Japanese side can learn from the U.S. Forces, which have
vast experience in actual fighting, are invaluable and greatly
contribute to improving SDF capabilities.
In addition, conducting bilateral training at effective times,
places, and scales demonstrates the unified commitment and
capabilities of Japan and the United States, which has a
deterrent effect. In light of these perspectives, the MOD/SDF
is continuing its initiatives to enrich the contents of bilateral
training and exercises.
Bilateral training has been expanded not only within Japan
but also to the United States by dispatching SDF units there.
Ongoing efforts are being made to enhance interoperability
and Japan-U.S. bilateral response capabilities at the military
branch and unit levels, including the Japan-U.S. Bilateral

combat training.
Since FY1985, mostly on an annual basis, command post
exercises and field training exercises have been conducted
alternately as the Japan-U.S. bilateral exercise. From January
to February 2018, command post exercises were conducted
at the Ministry of Defense in Ichigaya. Also, from October
to November of the same year, a Japan-U.S. Bilateral Joint
Exercise (field training) (Keen Sword 19) was carried out
in the water areas and airspace around Japan and in areas
including Guam of the United States, with approximately
47,000 personnel, 20 vessels, and 170 aircraft taking part
from Japan’s Ground, Maritime and Air Self-Defense Forces
(GSDF, MSDF, and ASDF).
As for recent training and exercises, the SDF participated
in the multilateral exercise “Rim of the Pacific Joint Exercise
(RIMPAC) 2018” organized by the United States Navy
from June to August 2018, and conducted anti-submersible
warfare training and amphibious training as well as training
in humanitarian assistance and disaster relief (HA/DR).
In the exercise, the GSDF held its first bilateral anti-ship
exercise with the U.S. Army and the MSDF using the Type
12 surface-to-ship missile system.

2018, vessels including MSDF Destroyer JS “Kirisame” and
U.S. aircraft carrier USS Ronald Reagan carried out JapanU.S. bilateral training from around the Bashi Channel to
the area south of Kyushu through the waters to the east of
Okinawa. In June 2019, as part of Indo-Pacific Deployment,
vessels including MSDF Destroyer JS “Izumo” and U.S.
aircraft carrier USS Ronald Reagan carried out Japan-U.S.
bilateral training in the South East Sea.
Since 2017, the ASDF has conducted various training with
U.S. Air Force strategic bomber B-52 in airspace over the Sea
of Japan and the East China Sea. In addition, from May till
June 2019, the ASDF participated in “RED FLAG-Alaska,”
an exercise conducted by the U.S. Air Force in Alaska, and
conducted training on air defense combat operation training,
etc.
The Japan-U.S. bilateral training was conducted with
the aim of enhancing the tactical skills of the SDF and
bolstering collaboration with the U.S. Forces. It is believed
that bolstering Japan-U.S. collaboration and demonstrating

With regard to bilateral ISR activities, it is important to
implement ISR activities in a broad Asia-Pacific region in
cooperation between Japan and the United States to enhance
the efficiency and effectiveness of the activities of both
countries.
The expansion of these ISR activities will function as

Japan-U.S. cooperation is also being steadily promoted
through logistics support based on the Acquisition and CrossServicing Agreement[1] (ACSA) signed in 1996 and revised
in 1999 and 2004. The Agreement is designed to positively
contribute to the smooth and effective operation under the

1 Maritime Security


Both Japan and the United States have made efforts as maritime
nations to maintain and develop “open and stable seas”
according to fundamental rules such as securing the freedom
and safety of navigation, and the rule of law including peaceful
dispute resolution based on international law.
For example, they have participated in the Combined Task
Force (CTF) 151 for countering piracy and the Proliferation
Security Initiative (PSI) Maritime Interdiction Exercise Pacific
Shield 18, hosted by Japan, in July 2018.
The two countries have also been working closely together
on providing multilateral capacity building assistance in the
maritime domain to countries including those along the sea lanes.

**2** **Initiatives for Leveraging Capabilities**


The NDPG provides that in order for Japan and the
United States to be able to fully leverage their capabilities
during bilateral activities, Japan will enhance and expand
cooperation with the United States in such areas as
equipment, technology, facility, and intelligence as well as
information security.

1 Defense Equipment and Technology Cooperation


Japan proactively promotes cooperation in defense equipment
and technology with the U.S. based on the Japan-U.S.
Security Treaty and the mutual cooperation principle from
the Mutual Defense Assistance Agreement between Japan
and the United States of America, while bearing in mind the
maintenance of the technological and industrial bases.
In view of the progress in technology cooperation between
Japan and the United States, the improvement of technological
level, and other factors, Japan decided to transfer its military
technology to the United States regardless of the Three
Principles on Arms Exports and related guidelines. In 1983,
Japan established the Exchange of Notes concerning the
Transfer of Military Technologies to the United States of
America.[1] In 2006, the Exchange of Notes concerning the
Transfer of Arms and Military Technologies to the United
States of America[2] was established to replace the foregoing
Exchange of Notes. Under these frameworks, Japan decided
to provide the United States with 20 items of arms and
military technologies, including military technologies
related to joint technological research on BMD. Japan and
the United States consult with each other at forums such as
the Systems and Technology Forum (S&TF) and conduct
cooperative research and development regarding the specific
projects agreed upon at these forums.
At the Japan-U.S. Defense Ministerial Meeting in
June 2016, the Ministers signed a Reciprocal Defense
Procurement Memorandum of Understanding (RDP MOU).[3]
The MOU promotes measures concerning the procurement
of equipment by Japanese and U.S. defense authorities based
on reciprocity (providing information necessary to submit
bids to businesses of the other country, protecting submitted
corporate information, waiving restrictions on participation
by businesses of the other country, etc.).
Part IV, Chapter 2, Section 5-2 (Deepening Relationships


with the United States regarding Defense Equipment and
Technology Cooperation) explains initiatives for the common
maintenance base for the 24 MV-22 Ospreys deployed by
the U.S. Marine Corps at MCAS Futenma and the V-22
Osprey deployed by the GSDF as well as initiatives for the
maintenance capability (regional depots) in the Asia-Pacific
region for F-35 fighter aircraft.

**Chapter**


2 Joint/Shared Use


The expansion of joint/shared use of facilities and areas
increases bases for the SDF’s activities such as maneuver
areas, ports, and airfields, which in turn enhances the
diversity and efficiency of Japan-U.S. bilateral training and
exercises, and expands the scope and raises the frequency of
activities such as ISR. The SDF has only a limited number of
facilities in Okinawa, including Naha Air Base, and most of
them are located in urban areas, which results in operational
limitations. The joint/shared use of facilities and areas of the
USFJ in Okinawa will greatly improve the SDF’s training
environment in Okinawa, and facilitate implementation of
joint training and exercises and increased interoperability
between the SDF and the U.S. Forces. It will also improve
readiness and contribute to ensuring the safety of local people
in case of a disaster.
Thus, while taking into account the SDF defense posture
in the regions, including the Southwestern Islands, and
relations with local communities, Japan and the United
States are proactively engaged in consultations, and specific
initiatives are steadily progressing. For example, the
GSDF has been using Camp Hansen since March 2008 for
exercises. Moreover, the relocation of the ASDF Air Defense
Command to Yokota in April 2012 and the relocation of the
GSDF Central Readiness Force Headquarters to Zama in
March 2013 were carried out. In addition, the development
of training ranges in Guam and the Northern Mariana Islands
(Tinian Island, Pagan Island, etc.) for shared use by the SDF
and the U.S. Forces is under consideration.

**4** **Steady Implementation of Measures Concerning the USFJ**


Under the Japan-U.S. Security Arrangements, the presence
of USFJ functions as deterrence, while on the other hand,
given the impacts of the stationing of the USFJ on the living
environment of the local residents, it is necessary to make
efforts appropriate for the actual situation of each area in
order to mitigate the impacts. In particular, the realignment
of the USFJ is a very important initiative for mitigation of the

**1** **Stationing of the USFJ**

1 Significance of the Stationing of the USFJ


Given the increasingly severe security environment
surrounding Japan, it is necessary to maintain the presence
of the USFJ and its readiness to make rapid and agile actions
in case of emergency in Japan and the surrounding areas
even in peacetime, so that Japan-U.S. Alliance based on
Japan–U.S. Security Arrangements functions enough as a
deterrent power that contributes to the peace and stability of
the defense of Japan and the region.
Therefore, Japan accepts the stationing of the US forces
based on the Japan-U.S. Security Treaty and it is a cornerstone
of Japan-U.S. Security Arrangements.
Also, it is essential to realize the stable stationing of the
USFJ in order to make a swift joint response to an armed
attack to Japan based on Article 5 of Japan-U.S. Security
Treaty. In addition, the actions of U.S. forces for the defense
of Japan are conducted not only by the USFJ but also by
timely reinforcements. The USFJ is supposed to be the basis
for them.
While Article 5 of Japan-U.S. Security Treaty stipulates
the duty of the U.S. to defend Japan, the U.S. is granted
the use of facilities and areas in Japan based on Article 6
for the purpose of maintaining the security of Japan and
international peace and security in the Far East. Therefore,
though the duties of each side are not the same, they are
balanced overall.


impact on local communities, including those in Okinawa,
and maintaining the deterrent capability of the U.S. Forces.
Therefore, the MOD will advance the realignment and
other initiatives and make continuous efforts to gain the
understanding and cooperation of the local communities
hosting USFJ facilities and areas.

and areas and the status of the USFJ, including the furnishing
of facilities and areas for use by the USFJ (USFJ facilities and
areas), and satisfying the labor requirements of the USFJ. In
addition, the Supplementary Agreement on the Environment
enhances cooperation for environmental stewardship relating
to the USFJ, and the Supplementary Agreement on Civilian
Component intends to clarify the scope of the civilian
component, etc.


**Chapter**


**(1) Furnishing of USFJ Facilities and Areas**
Japan furnishes USFJ facilities and areas under the provision
of the SOFA, in accordance with agreements reached through
the Joint Committee between the Governments of Japan and
the United States.
The Government of Japan concludes lease contracts with
owners of private and public lands on which USFJ facilities
and areas exist in order to ensure the stable use of these
facilities and areas. However, should the Government be
unable to obtain the approval of landowners, it shall acquire
title[2] under the Act on Special Measures for USFJ Land
Release,[3] compensating the landowners for any loss they
may have suffered in the process.

**(2) Satisfying Labor Requirements of the USFJ**
The SOFA stipulates that the manpower (labor) required
by the USFJ shall be satisfied with the assistance of the
Government of Japan.
As of the end of FY2018, there were 25,842 USFJ local
employees (hereinafter referred to as the “employees”) at
USFJ facilities and areas throughout Japan, working as clerks
at headquarters, engineers at maintenance/supply facilities,

members of security guards and fire departments on base,
and sales staff at welfare/recreational facilities. They support
the smooth operations of the USFJ.
The Government of Japan hires these employees in
accordance with the provisions of the SOFA. The MOD
supports the stationing of the USFJ by performing
administrative work for personnel management, payment of
wages, health care, and welfare, etc.

**(3) Supplementary Agreement on Cooperation in the Field of**
**Environmental Stewardship**

In September 2015, the Governments of Japan and the United
States signed and effectuated the Agreement on Cooperation
in the Field of Environmental Stewardship relating to the
USFJ, supplementary to the SOFA. This supplementary
agreement represents an international commitment with
legal binding force and sets forth provisions concerning
the issuance and maintenance of the Japan Environmental
Governing Standards (JEGS) and the establishment and
maintenance, etc. of procedures for access to USFJ facilities
and areas. This agreement was the first of its kind created
to supplement the SOFA since the SOFA had entered into
force and has a historical significance that differs essentially
in nature from conventional improvements in the operations
of the SOFA.


procedures for access to the site by GOJ and USG officials
in the event of off-base U.S. military aircraft accidents that
occur in Japan, and so on.
The major changes include clarification of expeditious
early entry into the inner cordon (restricted area) designated
in the event of an accident. The revised guidelines also
stipulate that entry into the site will be made with priority
given more clearly to validated USG and GOJ representatives
with responsibilities associated with accident site mitigation
to include hazardous material observation, the aircraft
accident investigation, or claims investigations; the U.S.
Forces will provide Japanese authorities with relevant
information especially on hazardous materials as soon as
practically possible after an accident; in removing wreckage
that has the potential to affect the condition of the underlying
Japanese property significantly and negatively, the U.S.
Forces will coordinate with the landowner through the
Regional Defense Bureau of the Ministry of Defense except
when the situation otherwise dictates; and that when the U.S.
authorities, GOJ authorities, or local authorities conduct
environmental surveys, the results will be shared within the
Joint Committee framework. These changes enable more
effective, expeditious and proper response to future U.S.
military aircraft accidents.

3 Costs Associated with the USFJ


Various costs associated with the USFJ include the costs of
stationing USFJ, costs for implementing the stipulations of the
SACO Final Report for mitigating the impact on the people
of Okinawa, as well as costs for implementing measures that
contribute to mitigating the impact on local communities
associated with the initiatives for the realignment of the U.S.
Forces.


**Chapter**


**(4) Supplementary Agreement on Civilian Component**
In January 2017, the Governments of Japan and the United
States signed the Supplementary Agreement on Civilian
Component, which came in to force on the same day. The
agreement clarifies the scope of the civilian component, which
is addressed only by a general provision in SOFA, develops
criteria used in evaluating contractor employee positions for
eligibility to receive designation as members of the civilian
component, and stipulates the procedures for notification and
review, etc. together with the exclusion of ordinary residents
from the civilian component. The initiative to formulate the
Supplementary Agreement on Civilian Component is the
second case, following the creation of the Supplementary
Agreement on the Environment that supplements the SOFA.

Facilities and Areas)


See Fig. III-2-4-1 (U.S. Forces Japan-related Costs (budget for
FY2019))

4 Host Nation Support (HNS)


HNS plays an important role to ensure the smooth and
effective implementation of the Japan-U.S. Security
Arrangements. Due to soaring prices and wages in Japan
since the mid-1970s, and changes in the international
economic situation, Japan began to bear labor costs such as
welfare costs in FY1978. Then in FY1979, it started to bear
costs for the Facilities Improvement Program (FIP).
Furthermore, as labor costs soared due to changes in
economic conditions that affected both countries, the

Note 1: Training relocation costs under the Special Measures Agreement extend either into the cost sharing for the stationing of USFJ or the SACO-related costs and
the realignment-related costs.
2: The SACO-related costs refer to the cost for implementing the contents of the SACO Final Report to reduce the impact on Okinawa, while the realignment-related costs
refer to the cost relating to a step to contribute to reducing the impact on local communities as part of the realignment initiatives. Since the cost-sharing for the stationing
of USFJ is Japan’s voluntary effort to bear some costs in light of the importance of ensuring the smooth and effective implementation
of the Japan-U.S. Security Arrangements, its nature is different from the SACO-related costs and the realignment-related costs, and is categorized separately.
3: The costs related to the stationing of USFJ include the MOD-related budget, other ministry-related budgets (base subsidy, etc.: ¥38.1 billion, FY2018 Budget)
and the estimated costs of government-owned land provided for use as USFJ facilities (¥164.0 billion, FY2018 Estimated Costs).

4: Numbers may not add up due to rounding.


**Chapter**


employment stability of the employees would be influenced
adversely, and there was even concern that it would affect
the activities of the USFJ. Therefore, in 1987, Japan and
the United States concluded an agreement that sets forth
special measures regarding Article 24 of the SOFA (the
Special Measures Agreement)[5] as exceptional, limited and
provisional measures under the cost principle in the SOFA.
Based on this agreement, Japan started to bear labor
costs of eight categories such as the adjustment allowance
(currently replaced by the regional allowance). As the Special
Measures Agreement (SMA) was revised later on, the costs
shared by Japan expanded to cover labor costs including base
pay, and utilities costs from FY1991, and training relocation
costs from FY1996.
Japan has been reviewing HNS, paying full attention to
its tight fiscal conditions, and as a result, HNS has been on a
steady decline after peaking out in the FY1999 budget on an
expenditure basis.

5 Current Special Measures Agreement


As the former SMA was effective up until March 2016, the
current SMA was intended to “open discussions pertaining to
future arrangements for an appropriate level for sharing of the


costs of U.S. Forces stationed in Japan” based on the “2+2”
agreement of April 2015. Following this agreement, Japan
and the United States held consultations on a new SMA, and
in December 2015, the Governments of Japan and the United
States reached agreement as follows: Subsequently, after the
new SMA was signed in January 2016 and approval by the
Diet, the new agreement took effect in April of the same year.
The key points of the new SMA are as follows:

**(1) Effective Period**
Five years (from FY2016 through FY2020)


**(2) Cost Sharing**
Japan shall bear all or part of the labor costs, utilities costs,
and the costs incurred in training relocation.

-  Labor Costs
The upper limit of the number of workers at welfare,
recreation, and morale facilities to be funded by Japan will
be reduced from 4,408 to 3,893, while the upper limit of the
number of workers engaged in activities such as maintenance
of assets and administrative works to be funded by Japan,
will be increased from 18,217 to 19,285. As a result, the

M t l C ti d S it b t J d th U it d St t f A i R di F iliti d A d th St t f U it d St t A d F i J


-----

upper limit of the number of workers to be funded by Japan
will be increased from the current 22,625 to 23,178. These
adjustments will be phased in over the new SMA period from
FY2016 to FY2020.

-  Utilities Costs
Over the new SMA period, the share of utilities costs to
be shared by Japan for each fiscal year is reduced from the
current 72% to 61%, with the upper limit for utilities costs
to be funded by Japan set at approximately 24.9 billion yen.

-  Costs for Facilities Improvement Program
The amount of costs for the FIP will not fall below 20.6 billion
yen in each fiscal year during the new SMA period. For the
period of the previous SMA, any amount of reductions in the
labor costs and the utilities costs was to be appropriated for
an increase in costs for the FIP. But such appropriation will
not be made during the new SMA period.

**(3) Scale of HNS**
The amount of HNS in FY2020, the final fiscal year of the
new SMA period, will be approximately 189.9 billion yen,
with the average amount for each fiscal year during the
same period coming to approximately 189.3 billion yen (any
change in wages based on recommendations by the National
Personnel Authority will be reflected appropriately in labor


costs for each fiscal year).

**(4) Cost-Saving Efforts**
It is clearly stipulated that the United States will make further
efforts to economize the above-mentioned expenditures.


6 USFJ Facilities and Areas and the Local Communities


The social conditions surrounding USFJ facilities and
areas have changed significantly, including, for example,
through urbanization over the past several decades. For
USFJ facilities and areas to fully exert their capabilities and
be genuinely accepted by the Japanese people, it is vital
to reduce the impact of the facilities and areas as much as
possible and secure the understanding and cooperation of the
local communities in light of such changes. Japan’s national
land is narrow with limited plains, and there are many cases
where USFJ facilities and areas are located close to urban and
business areas. In such areas, factors including the existence
of those facilities and areas, and the takeoffs and landings
of the U.S. Forces aircraft have considerable impact on the
residents’ living environment and local development. It is
therefore necessary to make efforts to mitigate the impact in
a way that is responsive to the circumstances of each area.

**2** **Progress of the Realignment of the USFJ**


but at the “2+2” Meeting on April 27, 2012, the United States
decided to alter the composition of the units and to deploy
the Marine Air-Ground Task Force (MAGTF)—consisting of
command, ground, aviation and logistics support elements—
in Japan, Guam, and Hawaii, as well as in Australia as a
rotational unit. In addition, the Governments of Japan and
the United States decided to delink both the relocation of
U.S. Marine Corps personnel from Okinawa to Guam and
the resulting land returns south of Kadena Air Base from the
progress on the Futenma Replacement Facility (FRF).


**Chapter**


“The United States-Japan Roadmap for Realignment
Implementation” (Roadmap) was set forth in May 2006.
Subsequently, the following factors were set forth: 1) The
necessity of implementing measures to realize visible
mitigation of the impact on Okinawa promptly and steadily;
2) The necessity of balancing the realignment package and
the strategic rebalance to the Asia-Pacific region, which was
set out in the U.S. Defense Strategic Guidance released in
January 2012; and 3) The reduction in the cost associated
with the relocation of the U.S. Marine Corps to Guam
demanded by the U.S congress. Full-fledged consultation
on the coordination of the realignment package took place
between the two countries in light of those factors. The
achievements thereof were announced as part of the Joint
Statements of the “2+2” Meeting and through other means.
The 2006 Roadmap stated that, among the III Marine
Expeditionary Force stationed in Okinawa, the main focus
of the relocation to Guam would be the command elements,

**3** **Stationing of the U.S. Forces in Okinawa**


In comparison to areas such as the U.S. mainland, Hawaii,
and Guam, Okinawa is located closer to potential conflict
areas that could affect Japan’s peace and security, including
the Korean Peninsula and the Taiwan Strait, but at the same
time has the advantage of having a certain distance from
these areas that would not heighten military tension there
unnecessarily. In addition, Okinawa, comprising a large
number of small islands, is located roughly in the center of the
Southwestern Islands having a total length of some 1,200 km
and close to key sea lanes for Japan, which depends on marine
transportation for over 99% of its overall international trade.
Furthermore, its location is extremely important from the
perspective of security, as Okinawa serves as a strategically
important target for neighboring countries in both making
access to the Pacific from the continent and rejecting access
from the Pacific to the continent.
Thus, the stationing of the U.S. Forces in Okinawa,
including the U.S. Marine Corps, which can deal with a wide
range of missions with high mobility and readiness and is
in charge of first response for a variety of contingencies,


with the above-mentioned geographical characteristics,
further ensures the effectiveness of the Japan-U.S. Alliance,
strengthens deterrence, and contributes greatly not only to
the security of Japan but also to the peace and stability of the
Asia-Pacific region.
On the other hand, Okinawa has many USFJ facilities and
areas such as air bases, maneuver areas and logistics facilities.
As of January 1, 2019, approximately 70% of USFJ facilities
and areas (for exclusive use) are concentrated in Okinawa
Prefecture, occupying approximately 8% of the land area of
the prefecture and approximately 14% of the main island of
Okinawa. Therefore, it is necessary to make utmost efforts to
mitigate the impact on Okinawa, while also considering the
above-mentioned security standpoints.

1 Initiatives for Realignment, Consolidation, and
Reduction of USFJ Facilities and Areas in Okinawa


When Okinawa was returned to Japan in 1972, the
Government of Japan provided 83 facilities and areas
covering approximately 278 km2 for exclusive use by the
U.S. Forces. However, their concentration in Okinawa has
led to strong calls for their realignment, consolidation and
reduction on the grounds that they seriously affect the lives
of people in Okinawa Prefecture.
Both countries have continued their initiatives to realign,
consolidate, and reduce USFJ facilities and areas, centering
on those subject to the strong local requests, and, in relation
to the so-called 23 issues, it was agreed in 1990 that both
sides would proceed with the required coordination and
procedures toward the return of land. Moreover, it was
agreed in 1995 that initiatives would also be made to resolve
the so-called Three Okinawa Issues,[6] including the return of
Naha Port (Naha City).
Subsequently, in response to an unfortunate incident that
occurred in 1995, as well as the refusal of the then Governor of
Okinawa to sign land lease renewal documents under the Act
on Special Measures for USFJ Land Release, the Government
of Japan decided to devote even greater initiatives towards
realignment, consolidation, and reduction, believing that
the impact should be shared by the whole nation. In order
to hold consultations on issues related to USFJ facilities and
areas in Okinawa, the Government of Japan established the
Okinawa Action Council between the central government
and Okinawa Prefecture, and SACO between Japan and the
United States, and the so-called SACO Final Report was
compiled in 1996.

3 Return of a Major Portion of the Northern Training Area


The condition for returning the Northern Training Area
was to relocate seven helipads in the area to be returned
to the preexisting training area. However, the Government
of Japan reached an agreement with the U.S. side to give
considerations for the natural environment and to relocate not
all seven but the minimum number of six helipads necessary,
and proceeded with the construction work. The relocation of
the helipads completed in December 2016, and on December
22 of the same year, the return of approximately 4,000 ha, a


2 Outline of SACO Final Report


The SACO Final Report stipulates the return of land, the
adjustment of training and operational procedures, noise
reduction, and the improvement of operational procedures
regarding the SOFA procedures, and also refers to the related
facilities and areas covered. The land to be returned based on
the SACO Final Report represents approximately 21% (about
50 km2) of USFJ facilities and areas in Okinawa at that time,
exceeding the amount of land returned during the period
between the reversion of Okinawa and the implementation
of the SACO Final Report, which is roughly 43 km2.


The Three Okinawa Issues refer to the return of Naha Port, the return of Yomitan Auxiliary Airfield, and the relocation of artillery live fire training over Highway 104.

The relocation (distribution and implementation) of artillery live fire training over Highway 104 in FY2019 is planned for Yausubetsu Maneuver Area, Ohjojihara Maneuver Area, North Fuji

major portion of the Northern Training Area located in the
villages of Kunigami and Higashi, was achieved based on the
SACO Final Report.
The returned land accounts for approximately 20% of
USFJ facilities and areas (for exclusive use) in Okinawa. The
return is the largest one since the reversion of Okinawa to the
mainland, and had been an issue for 20 years since the SACO
Final Report in 1996.
Based on the Act on Special Measures Concerning
Promotion of Effective and Appropriate Use of the Lands
in Okinawa Prefecture Previously Provided for Use by
the Stationed Forces, the MOD took measures to remove
obstacles (such as soil contamination survey, etc.) so that
the landowners, etc. can use returned lands effectively and
appropriately, and transferred the land to the landowners on
December 25, 2017.

4 Relocation and Return of MCAS Futenma


Along with the initiatives set forth in the roadmap related
to the realignment of the U.S. Forces, measures have been
implemented to alleviate the impact on the local communities
while maintaining the deterrence capabilities.
The Government of Japan believes that it is imperative
not to allow MCAS Futenma to remain indefinitely at
its current location, which is in the vicinity of houses and
schools in the center of Ginowan City, Okinawa Prefecture,
and considers that this is a fundamental idea shared between
the Government of Japan and the people of Okinawa.
As for the relocation of MCAS Futenma, the Government
of Japan has not changed its stance that the current plan to
construct the FRF at the Camp Schwab Henokosaki area
(Nago City) and adjacent waters is the only solution to avoid
the continued use of MCAS Futenma.
The Government of Japan plans to make further efforts
to achieve the relocation and return of MCAS Futenma as
early as possible and to mitigate the impact on Okinawa in a
speedy manner. The return of MCAS Futenma is expected to
eliminate danger in the area and to contribute to the further
growth of Okinawa, including Ginowan City, through the
reuse of the area (approximately 476 ha with a land area 100
times larger than Tokyo Dome).


living in the vicinity.
In the SCC (“2+2”) document compiled in October 2005,
the initiative to “locate the FRF in ‘L’-shaped configuration
that combines the shoreline areas of Camp Schwab and
adjacent water areas of Oura Bay” was approved. However,
since this L-shape meant that U.S. military aircraft would fly
over settlements in Nago City and Ginoza Village, a request
was submitted to avoid flights over these settlements. In
light of this, based on negotiation and agreement with the
local municipalities including Nago City, it was decided to
stipulate in the Roadmap that the FRF be located in a V-shape
configuration that “combines Henokosaki and adjacent
water areas of Oura and Henoko Bays.” With regard to
construction of this replacement facility, “a Memorandum of
Basic Understanding” was exchanged between the Governor
of Okinawa Prefecture Inamine and the then Minister of
State for Defense Nukaga in May 2006.
After the change of government in September 2009,
the Exploratory Committee for Okinawa Base Issues was
established. After reviews conducted by the Committee,
both governments, at the “2+2” Meeting held in May 2010,
confirmed the intention to locate the FRF in the Camp
Schwab Henokosaki area and the adjacent waters, and
decided that a study by experts regarding the replacement
facility's location, configuration and construction method
would be completed promptly. The two sides also agreed to
take concrete measures to mitigate the impact on Okinawa.
Subsequently, at the “2+2” Meeting held in June 2011, it was
decided that the runway would take a “V” shape.
During the deliberation process which led to these
conclusions, first of all, it was determined that, from a security
perspective, the deterrence of the U.S. Forces, including
that of the U.S. Marine Corps stationed in Okinawa that is
located in a crucial area for the security of Japan, cannot be
lessened while there remains instability and uncertainty in
the security environment in East Asia. Furthermore, concern
was expressed that the functions of the U.S. Marine Corps
such as mobility and readiness would be weakened if the
helicopter units stationed at MCAS Futenma were to be
detached from the other Marine units stationed in Okinawa
and moved abroad or out of the prefecture. Therefore, it was
concluded that the FRF had to be located within Okinawa
Prefecture.
Also at the “2+2” Meetings in April 2012, October 2013,
April 2015, August 2017, and April 2019, and in other
instances including the joint statement issued at the first
Japan-U.S. Summit Meeting during the Trump administration
in February 2017, the Governments of Japan and the United
States confirmed that the plan to construct the FRF at Camp
Schwab Henokosaki area and adjacent waters is the only

**(1) Background Concerning the Futenma Replacement Facility**
Considering the occurrence of the U.S. Forces helicopter
crash in Ginowan City in August 2004, bilateral discussions
on the realignment have been made towards realizing the
relocation and return of MCAS Futenma at the earliest
possible date in order to resolve the concern of the residents

in MCAS Futenma to be moved outside Okinawa Prefecture.
This move also led to the relocation of approximately 870
USFJ personnel, civilian employees, and dependents.
Moreover, the function of (3) “accepting a large number
of transient aircraft in contingencies” will also be transferred
to Tsuiki Air Base and Nyutabaru Air Base. In October 2018,
Japan and the United States agreed on developing facilities
that would be necessary for relocating the function, and
related work such as design of the facilities has been carried
out.
**b. Reduction in Area**
The area required for the land reclamation to build the
FRF is approximately 160 ha, less than one-third of the
approximately 476 ha of MCAS Futenma, and the new
facility will be equipped with a significantly shorter runway
at 1,200 m (1,800 m including the overruns) compared to the
current runway length of 2,740 m at MCAS Futenma.
**c. Reduction in Noise and Risks**
Two runways will be constructed in a V-shape, which
enables the flight path for both takeoff and landing to be
located over the sea, in line with the requests of the local
community. In MCAS Futenma, flight paths used daily for
training and other purposes are located over residential areas,
whereas flight paths in the FRF will be changed to over the
sea, thereby reducing noise and risks.
For example, while more than 10,000 households are
located in areas requiring housing noise insulation near
MCAS Futenma, there will be zero households requiring
such insulation around the FRF This means that the noise


**(2) Relocation of MCAS Futenma and Mitigation of the Impact**
**on Okinawa**

The relocation of MCAS Futenma holds more significance
than merely moving the facility from one location to another.
Rather, it involves reduction in the base’s functions and area
in Okinawa, and contributes greatly to mitigating the impact
on Okinawa.
**a. Distribution of Functions Offered by MCAS Futenma**
MCAS Futenma fulfills the following functions relating to
the aviation capabilities of the U.S. Marine Corps stationed
in Okinawa: (1) Operation of the Osprey and other aircraft;
(2) Operation of air refueling aircraft; and (3) Accepting
a large number of transient aircraft in contingencies. Of
these three functions, only (1) “operation of the Osprey
and other aircraft” will be relocated to Camp Schwab. As
for (2) “operation of air refueling aircraft,” all 15 KC-130
air refueling aircraft were relocated to MCAS Iwakuni (in
Iwakuni City, Yamaguchi Prefecture) in August 2014.
This marked the completion of a task that has remained
unresolved for 18 years since the SACO Final Report in
1996, enabling a vast majority of fixed-wing aircraft located

levels experienced by all households will comply with the
environment criteria applied to exclusive housing areas. In
the case that an aircraft encounters any contingency, safety on
the ground can be ensured by diverting the aircraft offshore.

**(3) The Necessity of Constructing the Futenma Replacement**
**Facility within Okinawa Prefecture**

The U.S. Marine Corps in Okinawa consists of air, ground,
logistics, and command elements. The interaction of those
elements is indispensable for U.S. Marine Corps operations
characterized by great mobility and readiness, so the FRF
needs to be located within Okinawa Prefecture so that rotarywing aircraft stationed at MCAS Futenma will be located
near the elements with which they train, operate, or otherwise
work on a regular basis.


of Japan and Okinawa Prefecture.[7]

Under these circumstances, the court came up with a
settlement recommendation, and the Government of Japan
and Okinawa Prefecture reached a court-mediated settlement
agreement in March 2016. In the settlement, the Government
of Japan and Okinawa mutually affirmed that after the final
judicial ruling is handed down by the Supreme Court, they
would abide by the ruling and take steps in line with the spirit
of the text of the ruling and the reasons conducive to the text,
and continue to take responses in good faith by cooperating
with each other in accordance with the purpose of the ruling.
Pursuant to the provisions of the settlement agreement,
the Director General of the Okinawa Defense Bureau
immediately suspended the land-fill work while the Minister
of Land, Infrastructure, Transport and Tourism issued an
instruction for correction based on the Local Autonomy
Act to then Governor Onaga to repeal the revocation of
the land-fill permit. Subsequently, in December 2016, after
examination by the Central and Local Government Dispute
Management Council and deliberation by the Fukuoka High
Court Naha Branch, the Supreme Court set forth the decision
that the revocation of the land-fill permit by then Governor
Onaga was illegal.
**b. Judgment of the Supreme Court**
In the judgment, the Supreme Court ruled that then Governor
Nakaima’s decision was not illegal. The court stated that no
circumstances could be found indicating that then Governor
Nakaima’s decision that the landfill was in compliance with
the condition in Article 4 (1) (i) of the Act on Reclamation
of Publicly-owned Water Surface, “that it is appropriate and
reasonable as the use of national land,” had no foundation
in fact, or clearly lacked reasoning under socially accepted
conventions. The reasons given by the court include: (1)
the area of the replacement facilities and the landfill area
will be significantly reduced from the area of the MCAS
Futenma facilities, and (2) aircraft flying over residential
areas can be avoided by the land-fill in the coastal area that
puts the runway extension out to the sea, and the replacement
facilities will be installed using part of Camp Schwab, which
is already provided to the U.S. Forces.
Moreover, regarding whether the construction of
replacement facilities takes environmental protection and
other considerations into adequate account, the Supreme
Court, finding that construction methods, environmental
protection measures and countermeasures that can conceivably
be taken at this point in time have been taken and that there is


**Chapter**


**(4) Completion** **of** **Environmental** **Impact** **Assessment**
**Procedures**

The MOD sent the environmental impact assessment scoping
document in 2007 to the Governor of Okinawa Prefecture
and other parties. After the MOD worked on revising the
document based on the opinions provided by the governor,
the MOD completed the environmental impact assessment
procedures by sending the revised assessment document to
related parties including the governor in December 2012,
while making the assessment document available for public
review. Throughout these procedures, the MOD received
a total of 1,561 opinions from the Governor of Okinawa
Prefecture on six occasions, made all the required revisions,
and reflected them in the content of the environmental
assessment. In this way, the MOD had taken steps to comply
with relevant laws, asked opinions and ideas from Okinawa
Prefecture over a sufficient period of time, and reflected
them in the assessment.

**(5) Promotion** **of** **the** **Futenma** **Replacement** **Facility**
**Construction Project**

**a. Suits over the Revocation of the Land-Fill Permit**
The Director General of the Okinawa Defense Bureau
submitted the land-fill permit request on public waters to
Okinawa Prefecture in March 2013, and then Governor
of Okinawa Nakaima approved this in December 2013.
However, then Governor of Okinawa Onaga revoked the
land-fill permit by then Governor of Okinawa Nakaima in
October 2015, leading to the filing of three suits over the
revocation of the land-fill permit between the Government


(1) The suit, filed by the Government of Japan as plaintiff based on Article 245-8 of the Local Autonomy Act, seeking a court ruling instructing a retraction of the revocation of the land-fill
permit by Governor Onaga (the so-called subrogation suit); (2) the suit, filed by Okinawa Prefecture based on Article 251-5 of the Local Autonomy Act, seeking to invalidate the decision to
suspend the validity of the revocation of the land-fill permit (the decision to stay execution) by the Minister of Land, Infrastructure, Transport and Tourism as the illegal “involvement of the
state”; and (3) the suit, filed by Okinawa Prefecture based on Article 3 of the Administrative Case Litigation Act, seeking to invalidate the decision to stay execution by the Minister of Land,

sufficient consideration for disaster prevention, determined
that it cannot be said that then Governor Nakaima’s decision
was illegal. The court did not find that there was anything
particularly unreasonable in then Governor Nakaima’s
decision-making process and the content of the decision that
the construction met the condition of Article 4 (1) (ii) of the
Act on Reclamation of Publicly-owned Water Surface, “the
land-fill gives sufficient consideration to the protection of
the environment and prevention of disasters.”
**c. Retraction of the Revocation of the Land-Fill Permit**
Following this Supreme Court ruling, on December 26,
2016, then Governor Onaga retracted the revocation of the
land-fill permit and the Okinawa Defense Bureau resumed
the replacement facilities construction project the following
day. On April 25, 2017, it started the construction of the
seawall, the main part of the public waters reclamation.
**d. Lawsuit Related to Damage to the Reefs on the Seafloor,**
**Etc.**
On July 24 of the same year, Okinawa Prefecture filed
suit in the Naha District Court, requesting that this seawall
construction not be allowed to damage the reefs on the
seafloor, etc., without permission from the Governor of
Okinawa based on the regulations of Okinawa Prefecture.
Subsequently, the district court dismissed Okinawa
Prefecture’s claim on March 13, 2018, and the Fukuoka High
Court Naha Branch dismissed Okinawa Prefecture’s appeal
on December 5 of the same year. On December 19, Okinawa
Prefecture filed a petition for acceptance of final appeal with
the Supreme Court, but withdrew the petition on March 29,
2019.
**e. Situation Surrounding the Land-Fill Work**
On August 31, 2018, Okinawa Prefecture revoked the landfill permit on the basis of problems concerning environmental
protection measures and the soil foundation of the land-fill
area. On October 17 of the same year, the Okinawa Defense
Bureau filed a request for review and a petition for a stay
of execution under the Administrative Complaint Review
Act against the revocation of the permit, and the stay of
execution was upheld on October 30. Following the ruling,
the Okinawa Defense Bureau resumed the land-fill operation
on December 14 of the same year in the waters south of
Camp Schwab .
On April 5, 2019, the Minister of Land, Infrastructure,
Transport and Tourism determined that the revocation of the
land-fill permit by Okinawa Prefecture should be repealed.
The Government of Japan is going forward with the


relocation to Henoko in order to achieve the total return of
MCAS Futenma.
In implementing the relocation, the MOD has conducted
environmental impact assessment for about five years, and
given the utmost consideration for the natural environment.
Throughout the procedures, the MOD received more than
1,500 opinions from the Governor of Okinawa Prefecture on
six occasions, all of which the MOD reflected in the content
of the environmental assessment.
If the waters are enclosed by the seawall, the coral
will be isolated from the surrounding sea with the flow of
seawater shut down, a situation which will affect the coral
habitat. Therefore, corals living in the land-fill area on the
southern side, which were designated for conservation, were
transplanted before the area was enclosed.
The standard for conservation of corals is stricter than the
standard that was applied to the land-fill related to the second
runway of Naha Airport.[8]

Regarding coenobita, which are nationally designated
protected species, and the shellfish and crustaceans designated
as endangered species, relocation from the seashore and
seafloors in the construction area on the southern side to
other areas is also being appropriately implemented based on
instructions and advice from experts.
Regarding the soil foundation of the land-fill area, as a
result of a study conducted on the stability of seawalls and
other structures in the waters north of Camp Schwab in
light of the results of a boring survey, it has been confirmed
that although the work to improve the soil foundation is
necessary, it is possible to implement the construction of
seawalls and land-fill while ensuring the required stability
through prevailing and adequately proven construction
methods.[9] Going forward, the Okinawa Defense Bureau will
conduct a study on such matters as a concrete design related
to the work to improve the soil foundation.
In February 2019, Okinawa Prefecture held a referendum
on whether or not to support the land-fill work related to
the relocation of MCAS Futenma to the Henokosaki area in
Nago City. As a result, 114,933 voters voted for the work,
434,273 voters voted against it, and 52,682 voters voted
neither (the total number of votes cast was 605,385 and the
voter turnout was 52.48%).
The present situation in which U.S. bases are concentrated
in Okinawa is in no way acceptable, and it is a grave
responsibility of the government to mitigate the impact on
Okinawa.


**Chapter**


Specifically, in relation to the construction of the second runway of Naha Airport, around 37,000 clusters of small corals were transplanted. If the same standard as the one applicable to
the construction of the alternative facility was applied, the number of clusters of small corals transplanted would have been around 170,000.

The standard methods are the sand compaction method and the sand drain method. Among examples of projects in which these methods were used is the construction work to expand
T k I t ti l Ai t (H d Ai t)


-----

The government takes the results of the prefectural
referendum seriously and continues to do its utmost to
mitigate the impact of bases on Okinawa.
It is imperative to prevent MCAS Futenma, which is
surrounded by houses and schools and which is said to be
the most dangerous base in the world, from continuing to
be used indefinitely and to pose a danger. The government
believes that this view is shared by the local residents.
The relocation to Henoko does not mean that all
functions of MCAS Futenma will be relocated there. Of
MCAS Futenma’s three functions, two will be moved out
of Okinawa while the remaining one will be relocated to
Henoko, resulting in the total return of the site of MCAS
Futenma.
Indeed, from the viewpoint of sharing the impact,
progress is being made in implementation of measures to
realize the total return of the site of MCAS Futenma based
on understanding and cooperation by local public entities
outside Okinawa. The measures include the relocation of air
refueling aircraft to Yamaguchi Prefecture and the relocation
of the function of accepting transient aircraft in contingencies
to Fukuoka and Miyazaki Prefectures.
Although more than 20 years have passed since Japan
and the United States agreed on the total return of the site
of MCAS Futenma, it has not been achieved yet. The MOD
believes that the return must not be postponed any longer.
The MOD intends to continue making efforts to secure the
understanding of local residents through years of persistent
dialogue, and do its utmost to achieve the total return of
MCAS Futenma as early as possible.

5 Force Reduction and Relocation to Guam


Since the Roadmap was announced in May 2006, the
Governments of Japan and the United States held a series of
consultations on the reduction of the U.S. Forces in Okinawa.


Kadena Air Base from the progress on the FRF and the
United States reviewed the composition of the units and the
number of personnel to be relocated to Guam. As a result, the
MAGTF is to be stationed and deployed in Guam, Japan, and
Hawaii, approximately 9,000 personnel are to be relocated
to locations outside of Japan (about 4,000 of whom are to
be relocated to Guam), the authorized strength of the U.S.
Marine Corps forces in Guam is to be approximately 5,000
personnel, and the end-state for the presence of the U.S.
Marine Corps in Okinawa is to be consistent with the level of
approximately 10,000 personnel envisioned in the Roadmap.
Accordingly, the “2+2” Meeting held in October 2013
agreed that, under the relocation plan described at the 2012
“2+2” Meeting, the relocation of U.S. Marine Corps units
from Okinawa to Guam is to begin in the first half of the
2020s. The plan is expected to promote the implementation
of the consolidation plan for facilities and areas in Okinawa
of April 2013.

**(2) Costs of the Relocation**
Under the Roadmap, the two sides reached an agreement that,
of the estimated US$10.27 billion (in U.S. fiscal year 2008
dollars) cost of the facilities and infrastructure development
costs, Japan would provide US$6.09 billion, including
US$2.8 billion in direct cash contribution, while the United
States would fund the remaining US$4.18 billion. In February
2009, the Japanese Government and the U.S. Government
signed “the Agreement Between the Government of Japan
and the Government of the United States of America
Concerning the Implementation of the Relocation of the
III MEF Personnel and Their Dependents from Okinawa to
Guam” (the Guam International Agreement). The Agreement
legally guarantees and ensures actions taken by Japan and
the United States, such as Japan’s long-term funding for
projects to which Japan provides direct cash contributions.
As part of measures based on this Agreement, the Japanese
Government has been providing cash contributions to the
U.S. Government in relation to the projects for which Japan
has provided financial support since FY2009.[10]

Subsequently, at the “2+2” Meeting held in April 2012, the
unit composition and the number of personnel to be relocated
to Guam were revised and it was agreed that the preliminary
cost estimate by the U.S. Government for the relocation
was US$8.6 billion (in U.S. fiscal year 2012 dollars). With
regard to Japan’s financial commitment, it was reaffirmed
that it was to be the direct cash contribution of up to US$2.8
billion (in U.S. fiscal year 2008 dollars) as stipulated in


**Chapter**


**(1) Timing and Size of Relocation**
The 2006 Roadmap stated that approximately 8,000 personnel
of the III MEF and approximately 9,000 dependents would
be relocated from Okinawa to Guam by 2014, but the “2+2”
Meeting in June 2011 and other agreements set the timing of

Article 1 of the Guam International Agreement.[11] It was
also confirmed that Japan’s equity investment and loans for
family housing projects and infrastructure projects would not
be utilized. Moreover, it was stipulated that any funds that
had already been provided to the U.S. Government under the
Guam International Agreement would be counted as part of
the Japanese contribution. Furthermore, as a new initiative,
a portion of the direct cash contribution of US$2.8 billion
mentioned above would be used to develop training areas
in Guam and the Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana

Islands as shared use facilities for Japan and the United
States. In addition, it was agreed that the remaining costs and
any additional costs would be borne by the United States,
and that the two governments were to complete a bilateral
cost breakdown.

Amending the Guam International Agreement was signed
to add the stipulations concerning the development of
training areas in Guam and the Commonwealth of the
Northern Mariana Islands, and the use of these training

areas by the SDF. The limit on Japanese cash contributions
remains unchanged at US$2.8 billion (in U.S. fiscal year
2008 dollars). Both countries also completed the process of
creating a detailed breakdown of required costs.
Furthermore, the National Defense Authorization Act
for U.S. Fiscal Year 2015 was enacted in December 2014,
which lifted the freeze on the use of funds for the relocation
to Guam imposed by the U.S. Congress in U.S. Fiscal Year
2012.

**(3) Completion** **of** **Environmental** **Impact** **Assessment**
**Procedures**

As for the environmental impact assessment for Guam, the
required procedures were conducted to reflect the revisions
to the project made by the adjustments to the plan for
realignment, and the assessment was completed in August
2015.
Furthermore, the Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana
Islands Joint Military Training Environmental Impact
Statement (CJMT-EIS), is now being implemented.


(1) land eligible for immediate return; (2) land eligible for
return once the relocation of functions is completed; and (3)
land eligible for return after the relocation abroad.

**(1) Consolidation Plan for Facilities and Areas in Okinawa**
Since the change of administration at the end of 2012, Japan
and the United States have continued consultation under
the basic policy of the Abe administration to dedicate all
its strength to mitigate the impact of the U.S. Forces on
Okinawa communities. Japan strongly requested an early
return of land areas south of Kadena, including Makiminato
Service Area (Camp Kinser) in Urasoe City of which
Okinawa has particularly made a strong request for the return
and coordination with the United States. As a result, both
countries announced the Consolidation Plan for Facilities
and Areas in Okinawa (Consolidation Plan) in April 2013,
which stipulated the return schedule, including the specific
years of return.
The return of all land according to the plan will enable
the return of approximately 70% (approximately 1,048 ha,
the equivalent of 220 Tokyo Domes) of six USFJ facilities
for exclusive use[12] located in densely populated areas in the
central and southern parts of the main island of Okinawa.
In the Consolidation Plan, both sides confirmed that
they would implement the plan as early as possible. The
Government of Japan will continue to work with all its
strength so that land areas south of Kadena would be returned
at the earliest possible date.
Furthermore, following the announcement of the
Consolidation Plan, consultations have been held since April
2013, involving Ginowan City, Ginowan City Military Land
Owners Association, Okinawa Prefecture, Okinawa Defense
Bureau, and Okinawa General Bureau in a bid to contribute
to the promotion of the effective and appropriate use of West
Futenma Housing Area within Camp Zukeran, and the MOD
has also been providing necessary cooperation.[13]


**Chapter**


**(4) Progress of the Guam Relocation Project**
While the environmental impact assessment for Guam was
being conducted, the Government of the United States
implemented infrastructure development projects at the
Andersen Air Force Base and the Apra area of the Naval
Base Guam as projects unaffected by the assessment. The
U.S. Government is currently implementing relocation
construction work in all project areas, following the lifting
of the freeze on the Guam relocation funds pursuant to the
National Defense Authorization Act and the completion of
the environmental impact assessment for Guam.

6 Return of Land Areas South of Kadena Air base


The Roadmap stated that following the relocation to the
FRF, the return of MCAS Futenma, and the transfer of III
MEF personnel to Guam, the remaining facilities and areas
on Okinawa will be consolidated, thereby enabling the
return of significant land areas south of Kadena Air Base.
Subsequently, at the “2+2” Meeting in April 2012, it was
decided to delink the progress on the FRF from both the
relocation of the III MEF personnel from Okinawa to Guam
and the resulting land returns south of Kadena. In addition,
with regard to the land to be returned, it was agreed to
conduct consultations focusing on three categories, namely


**(2) Progress in the Return of Land**
Efforts have been made to enable the early return of land
areas, including the land areas that are to be returned as soon
as required procedures are completed (shown in red in Fig.
III-2-4-9), since the announcement of the Consolidation Plan
in April 2013. These efforts resulted in the realization of
the return of the north access road of Makiminato Service
Area (approximately 1 ha) in August 2013, West Futenma
Housing Area of Camp Zukeran (approximately 51 ha) at
the end of March 2015 transferred to the landowners at the
end of March 2018, and the area near Gate 5 of Makiminato

Service Area (approximately 2 ha) at the end of March 2019.
Additionally, in December 2015, Japan and the United
States agreed to such measures as the early return of partial
land at MCAS Futenma (approximately 4 ha) for a municipal
road, and the early return of partial land at Makiminato
Service Area (approximately 3 ha) for the purpose of
widening National Route to reduce traffic congestion, for
which there had been particularly strong demand for return
among local people, and the former return was realized at
the end of July 2017, whereas the latter return was realized
at the end of March 2018. Furthermore, such measures as
relocation to Kadena Ammunition Storage Area (Chibana
Area), Torii Communication Station, Camp Hansen and
Camp Zukeran have been implemented to advance the land
return.
All-out initiatives are being continuously made to steadily
implement the return of land areas south of Kadena Air
Base under the Consolidation Plan and mitigate the impact
on Okinawa as early as possible, and also to realize the
respective returns of land in the shortest possible time for
more visible mitigation of the impact on Okinawa.

specified for U.S. Air Force, would be deployed to Yokota
Air Base (which encompasses Fussa City, Tachikawa City,
Akishima City, Musashi Murayama City, Hamura City and
Mizuho Town of Tokyo Prefecture). A total of 10 CV-22
Ospreys are scheduled to be deployed in stages by around
2024, with the first five CV-22s deployed to Yokota Air
Base on October 1, 2018.
The CV-22 deployed to Yokota Air Base plays a role in
transporting personnel and supplies of the special operation
units of the U.S. Forces to address crises and emergencies
in the Asia-Pacific region, including humanitarian assistance
and natural disasters.
As Japan faces the increasingly severe security
environment, the deployment of high-performance CV-22 is
supposed to enhance the deterrence and response capabilities
of the Japan-U.S. Alliance and contribute to the defense of
Japan and the stability of the region from the perspective of
the commitment by the U.S. to the Asia-Pacific region and
the building-up of readiness by the United States.


7 Deployment of Osprey to Japan by the U.S. Forces


**(1) Deployment of U.S. Marine Corps MV-22 Osprey to Okinawa**
Osprey is an aircraft that combines the vertical takeoff/
landing and hovering functions of rotary-wing aircraft
and the flight speed and range of fixed-wing aircraft. As a
primary asset of the marine air unit, the MV-22, specified for
the U.S. Marine Corps, plays an important role in engaging
in a broad range of activities, including transportation of
personnel and supplies.
The U.S. Marine Corps replaced aged rotary-wing
aircraft (CH-46) with MV-22s, which have superior basic
performance. In September 2013, all the 24 CH-46s deployed
at MCAS Futenma were replaced by MV-22s.
The MV-22 is a highly capable aircraft compared with
the CH-46: on its flight speed, payload and flight range.
Its deployment to Okinawa strengthens the deterrence of
the overall USFJ and greatly contributes to the peace and
stability of the region.

**(3) Safety of Osprey**
Prior to the deployment of MV-22s to MCAS Futenma in
2012, Japan established an analysis and assessment team
composed of aircraft pilots and experts from inside and
outside the Government and confirmed the safety of MV22 by conducting its own survey, etc. In addition, when
Japan made the decision to introduce Ospreys in 2014, the
Government reconfirmed their safety by collecting and
analyzing all kinds of technical information.
Regarding the recent accidents involving the MV-22 that
occurred in Okinawa and Australia, the U.S. indicated that
there was no structural problem with the aircraft, and that
necessary measures have also been taken after the accidents
to prevent recurrence. Thus, Japan evaluates that there is no

problem with the safety of the MV-22.
Additionally, the CV-22 has the same propulsion system
as the MV-22 and the structure of both aircraft is basically in
common; therefore, the Government of Japan considers the
safety of both aircraft to be at the same level.
Japan considers that ensuring safety is of prime
importance in operations of the U.S. Forces, and on various
occasions, including the Japan-U.S. Defense Ministerial
Meeting in October 2018, Minister of Defense requested
Secretary of Defense and other high-ranking officials to give
consideration to local communities and ensure safety. The
Government of Japan will continue to ask for the maximum
consideration for safety.

part of the Philippines in November 2013, [14] MV-22 aircraft,
deployed in Okinawa, were dispatched for humanitarian
assistance and disaster relief activities to support Operation
Damayan. The MV-22s were deployed promptly to affected
areas that were difficult to access, and transported several
hundred isolated victims and about six tons of relief materials
in a day.
In April 2014, the MV-22, deployed in Okinawa, was
dispatched for search and rescue activities in the wake of an
accidental sinking of a passenger ship off the coast of Jindo
in the ROK.
Furthermore, in response to the large earthquake that hit
Nepal in April 2015, four MV-22s deployed in Okinawa
were dispatched to the country to transport personnel and
supplies.
In Japan, when the Kumamoto Earthquake occurred in
2016, MV-22s were dispatched to deliver daily necessities to
the disaster stricken areas.
In this manner, the MV-22 is capable of conducting
humanitarian assistance and disaster relief activities

Vice Governor of Okinawa, was established with the purpose
of holding consultations on measures for the mitigation
of the impact on Okinawa and measures for Okinawa’s
development. In the meetings that have been held three times
since January 2016, discussion took place on issues such as
the relocation of MCAS Futenma and the suspension of its
operation within five years and the return of more than half
of the Northern Training Area.

9 Initiatives for the Use of Lands Previously Provided for
Use by the Stationed Forces


The Act on Special Measures Concerning Promotion of
Effective and Appropriate Use of the Lands in Okinawa
Prefecture Previously Provided for Use by the Stationed
Forces stipulates various measures concerning lands in
Okinawa provided for use by the USFJ (“USFJ Land”)
agreed to be returned. The MOD mainly conducts the
following initiatives, and will continue its initiatives to
promote the effective and appropriate use of returned lands
by coordinating and cooperating with related ministries, the
prefectural government and local municipalities. The MOD:
(1) conducts mediation in relation to access for surveys, etc.,
to be implemented by the prefectural government and
local municipalities on the USFJ Land which are agreed
to be returned;
(2) conducts measures applying to all the returned lands
to remove obstacles for use such as soil contamination
and unexploded ordnance, not only those caused by the
activities of the stationed forces, before handing over the
land to the owners and
(3) provides financial benefits to alleviate the impact on the
owners of the returned lands and to promote use of the
land.


8 Consultation Structures for Mitigating the Impact on
Okinawa


Today, a number of USFJ facilities and areas still remain in
Okinawa because of the long U.S. occupation of Okinawa
and the slower progress of return of USFJ facilities and areas
compared to other areas of Japan even after the occupation
ended. In order to mitigate the concentrated impact on
Okinawa, the Government of Japan has been implementing
initiatives towards the realization of the SACO Final Report
and the Roadmap. The MOD is committed to further
mitigating the impact on Okinawa through the Okinawa
Policy Council, its subcommittee and other means, while
listening to the opinions of the local residents.14
At the Okinawa Policy Council Meeting in December
2013, then Governor of Okinawa Nakaima presented
several requests, including cessation of the operation of
MCAS Futenma within five years and its early return, the
re-deployment of about twelve MV-22s to bases outside of
Okinawa, and the total return of Makiminato Service Area
within seven years. The Japanese Government as a whole
is addressing the mitigation of the impact on Okinawa by
establishing the Council for Promoting the Mitigation of the
Impact of MCAS Futenma on Okinawa, consisting of the
Chief Cabinet Secretary, the Minister of State for Okinawa,
the Minister for Foreign Affairs, the Minister of Defense, the
Governor of Okinawa and the Mayor of Ginowan. The MOD
also created the Committee for Promoting the Mitigation
of the Impact of Bases on Okinawa headed by the State
Minister of Defense in January 2014 to continually work on
the reduction of the impact on Okinawa.
The Consultation between the Central Government
and Okinawa Prefecture, consisting of the Chief Cabinet
Secretary, the Minister of State for Okinawa, the Minister for
Foreign Affairs, the Minister of Defense, the Deputy Chief
Cabinet Secretary (administrative) and the Governor and

as Stipulated in the Roadmap


**(1) Improvement of U.S. Army Japan Command and Control**
**Capability**

The headquarters of U.S. Army Japan (USARJ) at Camp
Zama (Sagamihara City and Zama City in Kanagawa
Prefecture) was reorganized into the headquarters of the
USARJ&I Corps (Forward) in December 2007 and the
reorganization took place at the end of September 2008.
In order to make close communication and adjustments

in peacetime and to be able to promptly respond to various
situations, the headquarters of the Ground Component
Command of the GSDF has set up the Japan-U.S. Joint
Headquarters at Camp Zama and has strengthened
coordination with the headquarters of USARJ.
In February 2016, the partial release of land (approximately
5.4 ha) at Camp Zama was realized and Zama General
Hospital was established on the returned site in April 2016.
In addition, in December 2015, the shared use of a portion of
land at Sagami General Depot (Sagamihara City in Kanagawa
Prefecture) (approximately 35ha) with Sagamihara City was
realized. In other areas, the realignment projects associated
with the improvement of U.S. Army Japan command and
control capability have been undertaken as shown in Fig. III2-4-12.

Command and Control Capability and Mitigation of Impact)


enhance coordination between the headquarters of the SDF
and the U.S. Forces, including the sharing of information
concerning air defense and BMD.
**b. Yokota Airspace**
To facilitate the operations of civilian aircraft in Yokota
airspace, where the U.S. Forces conduct radar approach
control, measures have been taken since 2006 to temporarily
transfer the responsibility for air traffic control of portions
of Yokota airspace to Japanese authorities, to deploy ASDF
officers at the Yokota Radar Approach Control (Yokota
RAPCON), and to reduce the airspace by about 40% (i.e.,
the release of air traffic control from USFJ).
**c. Civilian-Military Dual Use of Yokota Air Base**
At the Japan-U.S. Summit Meeting held in May 2003, it
was agreed that the joint civilian-military use of Yokota
Air Base would be studied, and a Liaison Conference was
then established as a working panel attended by relevant
government ministries and agencies and the Tokyo
Metropolitan Government. The Governments of Japan and
the United States are also conducting a study on the specific
conditions and modalities, with the understanding that both
countries will not compromise the military operations and
safety of Yokota Air Base.

**(3) Deployment of U.S. Aircraft Carrier to Commander Fleet**
**Activities, Yokosuka**

The presence of the U.S. Pacific Fleet plays an important role
in ensuring maritime security in the Indo-Pacific region as
well as regional peace and stability. The U.S. aircraft carrier
provides the core capability of the Fleet.
The U.S. Navy affirms that it will continue to ensure that all
of its forward-deployed nuclear-powered vessels, including

Enhancement of coordination between the headquarters
of both countries, combined with the transition to joint
operational posture, is highly important to ensure a response
with flexibility and readiness of the SDF and the U.S. Forces.
Therefore, at the end of FY2011, the BJOCC commenced
its operations at Yokota Air Base and the ASDF Air Defense
Command HQ and its relevant units were relocated to Yokota
Air Base.[15] These arrangements have made it possible to

Implemented Currently under implementation or scheduled for implementation


**Chapter**


USS Ronald Reagan,[16] while anchored at Commander Fleet
Activities, Yokosuka (Yokosuka City, Kanagawa Prefecture),
adhere to the relevant safety policies. For example, the
nuclear reactor will normally be shut down while the aircraft
carrier is anchored, and repairing and refueling will not be
carried out in Japan. The Government of Japan intends to
continue taking all possible measures to ensure safety.

**(4) Measures Relating to Naval Air Facility Atsugi and MCAS**
**Iwakuni**

**a. Relocation of Carrier-Based Aircraft**
Since Naval Air Facility Atsugi (Ayase City and Yamato City
in Kanagawa Prefecture) is located in an urban district, the
noise of carrier jets taking off and landing in particular had
been a problem for a long time.
Thus, after the completion of the runway relocation project
at MCAS Iwakuni (Iwakuni City, Yamaguchi Prefecture),
which made aircraft operations possible with less impact on
the living environment of the surrounding communities, it
was decided that CVW-5 squadrons would be relocated from
Naval Air Facility Atsugi to MCAS Iwakuni. The relocation
began in August 2017 and completed in March 2018.[17] As a
result, the noise in areas around Naval Air Facility Atsugi
was alleviated to a significant extent, while maintaining the
forward deployment of a U.S. aircraft carrier and carrierbased aircraft. This would not have been possible without


the understanding of residents of Yamaguchi Prefecture and
Iwakuni City.
In order to mitigate impacts of the increased operations at
MCAS Iwakuni due to the relocation, the related measures
listed in Fig. III-2-4-13 have been implemented. If all of
these measures are fully implemented, the noise problems
are expected to be mitigated from the current situation, with
the area requiring residential noise-abatement work, or the
so-called first category area, decreasing from approximately
1,600 ha to approximately 650 ha.

See Fig. III-2-4-13 (Measures Related to Naval Air Facility Atsugi
and MCAS Iwakuni and Their Status of Progress, etc.)


**b. Field-Carrier Landing Practice (FCLP)**
The 2006 Roadmap prescribes that a bilateral framework
to conduct a study on a permanent FCLP facility is to be
established with the goal of selecting a permanent site at the
earliest possible date. At the “2+2” Meeting of June 2011,
it was confirmed that the Government of Japan will explain
to local authorities that Mageshima Island is considered
to be the candidate site for a new SDF facility. This SDF
facility would be used to support operations in response to a
variety of situations, including large-scale disasters, as well
as regular exercises and other activities, including use by
the U.S. Forces as a permanent site for FCLP. In addition,
the 2005 SCC document confirmed that the U.S. Forces will

continue to conduct FCLP at Iwo-To in accordance with
existing temporary arrangements until a permanent training
facility is identified.
**c. Resumption of Civil Aviation Operations at MCAS Iwakuni**
Considering that the local public entities, etc., including
Yamaguchi Prefecture and Iwakuni City, had been
working together to request the resumption of civil aviation
operations, it was agreed in the Roadmap that “portions of the
future civilian air facility will be accommodated at MCAS
Iwakuni.” Based on this agreement, Iwakuni Kintaikyo
Airport was opened in December 2012, resuming regular
flights of civil aviation aircraft for the first time in 48 years.

**(5) Ballistic Missile Defense (BMD)**
In June 2006, an AN/TPY-2 radar (so-called “X-Band
Radar”) system was deployed to the U.S. Shariki Radar Site
(Tsugaru City, Aomori Prefecture).[18] Also in October 2006,
U.S. Army Patriot PAC-3 units (Patriot Advanced Capability)
were deployed to Kadena Air Base (Kadena Town, Okinawa
City and Chatan Town in Okinawa Prefecture) and Kadena
Ammunition Storage Area (Yomitan Village, Okinawa City,
Kadena Town, Onna Village and Uruma City in Okinawa
Prefecture). In December 2014, the second TPY-2 radar in
Japan was deployed to the U.S. Kyogamisaki Communication
Site (Kyotango City in Kyoto Prefecture).
The United States deployed Aegis destroyers with BMD
capabilities to Commander Fleet Activities, Yokosuka in
October 2015, March 2016 and May 2018.


A U.S. Marine Corps MV-22 Osprey flying to the Aibano Maneuver Area
(Shiga Prefecture) for training (February 2019)

Furthermore, in March 2014, both governments at the
Joint Committee agreed to add air-to-ground training
using the Misawa Air-to-Ground Range (Misawa City and
Rokkasho Village in Aomori Prefecture). This agreement
resulted in air-to-ground training using the Misawa Air-toGround Range in June 2014.
The training relocation contributes to enhancing
interoperability between the two countries, and also to
relocating part of air-to-ground training conducted by using
Kadena Air Base. Thus, this training relocation will help noise
abatement around Kadena Air Base, thereby contributing to
the mitigation of the impact on Okinawa.
In addition to assisting the USFJ, the MOD/SDF is
making efforts to ensure the safety and security of the local
community, such as the establishment of a liaison office,
facilitating communication with related government agencies,
and response to requirements from the local community.
These efforts have been contributing to successful training
relocation.
**b. Relocation of Training for MV-22**
The Government of Japan and the United States Government
decided in the “2+2” joint statement of October 3, to
utilize the opportunities to participate in various operations
in mainland Japan and across the region to reduce the
amount of time that MV-22s are deployed and used for the
training in Okinawa so that training outside of Okinawa
Prefecture, including mainland Japan, can be increased while
maintaining the deterrence of the Alliance. Based on this,
both the governments have been moving forward with the
training outside of Okinawa Prefecture, etc. for the MV-22
deployed at MCAS Futenma.
On September 1, 2016, it was agreed at the Joint
Committee to relocate the training activities of Tilt-Rotor /
Rotary Wing aircraft, such as the AH-1 and CH53, and the
MV-22 that are currently deployed at MCAS Futenma out


**Chapter**


See Part III, Chapter 1, Section 2-2-(1) (Japan’s Comprehensive Air
and Missile Defense Capability)

**(6) Training Relocation**
**a. Aviation Training Relocation (ATR)**
Based on the decision that U.S. aircraft from three USFJ
facilities and areas—Kadena, Misawa (Misawa City and
Tohoku Town in Aomori Prefecture) and MCAS Iwakuni—
would participate for the time being in bilateral training
with the SDF at SDF facilities, training relocation has been
underway since 2007. The MOD has been improving its
infrastructure, as required, for the training relocation.[19]

In January 2011, at the Joint Committee, based on
the achievements at the “2+2” Meeting in 2010, both
governments agreed to include Guam as a new training
relocation site and to expand the scale of training. After
that, the relocation of training to Guam and other locations
was realized, and a series of training sessions have been
conducted at the relocation sites.

December 2018, and in Shiga Prefecture in February 2019 as
Japan-U.S. joint training (field training between the GSDF
and the U.S. Marine Corps). Meanwhile, the Japan-U.S. joint

**5** **Initiatives for Smooth Implementation of the Realignment of the USFJ**


In order to smoothly implement the realignment of the USFJ
based on the Roadmap, the Act on Special Measures on
Smooth Implementation of the Realignment of United States
Forces in Japan (USFJ Realignment Special Measures Act)
was enacted in August 2007. Realignment grants, Special
Subsidy Rates for Public Projects, etc. and other systems
were established based on the law.
During a period of time before and after the implementation
of realignment (10 years in principle),[20] realignment grants
will be awarded to help cover the expenses of projects[21]
which contribute to increasing the convenience of the
lives of residents of local municipalities affected by the
realignment,[22] and to stimulate local industries. To this end,
they will be awarded in accordance with progress made in the
steps of U.S. Forces realignment, after the Defense Minister
designates the specified defense facilities and neighboring
municipalities affected by realignment. As of April 2019, 9
defense facilities in 14 municipalities are eligible to receive


Earthquake, which occurred on September 6 of the same
year.
The MV-22’s amount of time deployed and training in
Okinawa will continue to be reduced by relocating exercises
in which MV-22 participate to the mainland of Japan and
Guam, and the Government will continue to promote
initiatives that contribute to further mitigating the impact on
Okinawa.

the grant.
In addition, under the U.S. Forces realignment, some USFJ
facilities and areas will be returned, and the U.S. Marine
Corps in Okinawa will be relocated to Guam. Since these
developments may affect the employment of USFJ local
employees, the Government of Japan will take measures to
include education and skills training, which is to help retain
their employment.
The Realignment Special Measures Act was supposed
to cease to be effective as of March 31, 2017. However,
since there remain realignment projects that require
implementation, an act revising part of the Act including a
ten-year extension of the time limit of the Act to March 31,
2027 was enacted.


**Chapter**


See Reference 35 (Outline of the Act on Special Measures on
Smooth Implementation of the Realignment of United States
Forces in Japan)

**6** **Measures to Mitigate the Impacts of USFJ Facilities and Areas**


on this announcement, Japan-U.S. consultations have
been enhanced. The MOD has been working with relevant
ministries and agencies to enhance cooperation for regular
reviews of the Japan Environmental Governing Standards
(JEGS)[24] compiled by the USFJ, exchange information on
the environment, and deal with environmental pollution.
Furthermore, in September 2015, the Governments
of Japan and the United States signed and effectuated the
Agreement on Cooperation in the Field of Environmental
Stewardship relating to the USFJ, supplementary to the


1 Initiatives to Conserve the Environments around USFJ
Facilities and Areas


At the “2+2” Meeting in September 2000, based on the
recognition that environmental conservation is important,
the governments of both nations agreed to make it a common
objective to ensure the health and safety of residents in the
vicinity of USFJ facilities and areas, U.S. Forces personnel,
their families and other such parties, and made the “Joint
Statement of Environmental Principles.”[23] To follow up

21 Under the Realignment Special Measures Act, changes in the composition of units of those naval vessels that conduct operations integrally with U.S. air wings subject to realignment
(replacement of the aircraft carrier at Commander Fleet Activities, Yokosuka with a nuclear aircraft carrier) will be treated in the same way as the realignment of the USFJ.

22 The specific scope of projects includes 14 projects identified by Article 2 of the enforcement ordinance of the Act on Special Measures on Smooth Implementation of the Realignment of
United States Forces in Japan, including education, sports, and cultural projects.

SOFA. This supplementary agreement represents an
international commitment with legal binding force and sets
forth provisions concerning issuance and maintenance of
the Japan Environmental Governing Standards (JEGS) and
establishment and maintenance, etc. of procedures for access
to USFJ facilities and areas.

2 Ensuring Safety of Operations of the USFJ


Ensuring the safety of local residents is of prime importance
in USFJ operations, and an accident or incident must not
occur. Both Japan and the U.S. cooperate with a prime focus
on ensuring the safety.
Despite such circumstances, a CH-53E helicopter
assigned to MCAS Futenma made an emergency landing at
Higashi Village in Kunigami District and burned into flames
in October 2017, and a window of another CH-53E assigned
to MCAS Futenma fell onto the playground of Futenma
Daini Elementary School in December 2017. Then in 2019,
there have been precautionary and emergency landings of
U.S. military aircraft on civilian airports, etc.


Regarding these accidents and incidents, Japan has
clearly conveyed its position to the U.S. side and requested
preventive measures to avoid reoccurrence especially at
summit and ministerial levels, in light of anxieties and
concerns of local communities.
Causes of these accidents and incidents may vary
depending on the case, but the Government of Japan has
determined the rationality of the causes by not only hearing
the results of investigations and preventive measures on
the U.S. side but also confirming with SDF expertise.
Additionally, the MOD has strongly requested the U.S. side
to provide information regarding the accidents and incidents,
and explained the information obtained from the U.S. side to
the relevant local authorities in a timely manner.

3 Other Measures


The Government of Japan has been taking measures for the
improvement of the living environment in regions surrounding
USFJ facilities and areas. The Ministry of Internal Affairs
and Communications also provides municipalities with base


**Chapter**


**Exchange between U.S. Forces and Local Residents**

The understanding and cooperation of local people are indispensable for the stationing of U.S. Forces in Japan (USFJ).
The MOD holds a Japan-U.S. exchange program every year to deepen mutual understanding between Japan and the
United States with the understanding and cooperation of the local governments and USFJ. Under the program, residents
living near USFJ facilities and areas together with USFJ personnel enjoy sports, music and cultural exchanges.
In FY2018, for example, the MOD hosted a Japan-U.S. Sports Festival for elementary school children of the U.S.
Fleet Activities, Yokosuka (Yokosuka City, Kanagawa Prefecture) and Yokosuka City. During the festival, the children

participated in long-rope jumping in Japan-U.S. combined teams, a chasing ball-toss game, tug-of-war, Japan-U.S. pairing
game, and Yokosuka trivia quiz.
Around Iwakuni Air Base (Iwakuni City, Yamaguchi Prefecture), the MOD held a Japan-U.S. Sports Exchange for
elementary school children in the base and Iwakuni City. Exchanges are deepened through a sports class of three field and
track events – high-hurdle race, long jump, and throwing – given by former athletes and other instructors. After the class,
Japan-U.S. combined teams participated in relays and played dodge ball.
The MOD believes that many years of exchange will foster a trusting relationship between local people and the USFJ and
will continue to hold Japan-U.S. exchange programs with the understanding and cooperation from the local governments
and the USFJ.

grants, which have alternate features in terms of municipal
tax on real estate.
Moreover, in the vicinity of USFJ facilities and areas,
incidents and accidents caused by U.S. Forces personnel and
others have affected local areas and their residents, so the
Government of Japan has requested the USFJ to take effective
measures for the prevention of recurrence, such as educating
military personnel and others, and enforcing strict discipline
among them. The Government of Japan is cooperating with
the USFJ in these prevention measures; at the same time it
has taken measures for prompt and appropriate compensation
for the damage caused by the incidents and accidents.
The United States has also taken measures for its part,
putting in place its guidelines for off-duty action (liberty
policy), including measures such as nighttime alcohol
restrictions as well as curfews applying to U.S. Forces
personnel ranked below a certain rank.

Meanwhile, the Government of Japan prepared Crime
Prevention Measures in Okinawa in June 2016 under the
understanding that it is necessary for the Government to
promptly promote measures to deter crime and ensure the
safety and security of the people of Okinawa. The pillars
of the Measures consist of bolstering crime prevention
patrol operations and the establishment of a safe and secure
environment. The MOD is participating in the Okinawa
Local Safety Patrol Corps established in the Okinawa
General Bureau and will continue to cooperate with relevant
ministries and agencies to ensure the implementation of
effective measures.

**Security Cooperation**
### 3


In situations where the need and potential for international
cooperation in the security and defense areas are increasing
unprecedentedly, the Ministry of Defense (MOD)/SelfDefense Forces (SDF) is required to actively contribute to
ensuring the security of Japan, the peace and stability of the
region, and the peace, stability, and prosperity of the entire
international community from the perspective of “Proactive
Contribution to Peace” based on the principle of international
cooperation.
In line with the free and open Indo-Pacific vision,
and in accordance with the National Defense Program
Guidelines for FY2019 and beyond (NDPG),[1] Japan will
strengthen bilateral and multilateral defense cooperation and
exchanges as part of multi-faceted and multi-layered security
cooperation, while paying attention to its partner nations’
regional characteristics and situations. Japan will also
actively advance its efforts to solve global security issues,
including securing the freedom and safety of navigation

**(1) Signifi cance of Security Cooperation, and Defense**
**Cooperation and Exchanges**

The peace and stability of the Indo-Pacific region is closely
related to Japan’s security. In addition, with increasingly
changeable and complicated global power dynamics, and
escalation of political, economic, and military inter-state
competition, they are also becoming a more important issue
for the international community. While nations with largescale military power concentrate in the region, no framework
for regional security cooperation has been sufficiently
institutionalized. As national political, economic and social
systems differ widely in the region, visions of security vary
from country to country. Furthermore, there have been an
increasing number of unilateral actions attempting to change


and overflight, coordination and cooperation with relevant
countries in relation to the use of the space and cyber
domains, international peace cooperation activities, arms
control and disarmament, and non-proliferation of weapons
of mass destruction. These efforts will be promoted mainly
under the framework of the Japan-U.S. Alliance and in close
coordination with countries that share the same universal
values and security interests as Japan. Japan intends to create
an ideal security environment through these steady-state
efforts.
The MOD/SDF has already been conducting activities
to promote security cooperation. The MOD/SDF further
intends to create a security environment desirable for Japan
by engaging in the routine activities indicated in the NDPG.
This chapter explains activities related to the enhancement
of security cooperation while taking into consideration the
concept of the NDPG.

**Strategic Promotion of Multi-Faceted and Multi-Layered Defense Cooperation**

**Signifi cance and Evolution of Security Cooperation and Dialogue, and Defense Cooperation and**

the status quo by coercion without paying respect to existing
international law. The issues involving the South China Sea,
in particular, cause concerns over the maintenance of the rule
of law at sea, freedom of navigation and overflight, and the
stability of the Southeast Asian region. Thus, responses to
these issues have become an important challenge to ensure
the regional stability.
In order to build mutual trust among nations and establish
a foundation for cooperation for solving regional security
issues, Japan will strategically promote multi-faceted and
multi-layered security cooperation, while taking into account
the international situation, regional characteristics, and
situations and security issues other nations are faced with.
**(2) Forms and History of Security Cooperation and Defense**
**Cooperation and Exchanges**

Defense cooperation and exchanges have been delivered


**Chapter**

-----

in the forms of high-level dialogues and exchanges, joint
training and exercises, capacity building cooperation for
recipient countries (such as human resources development
and technical assistance in the security and defense fields),
and defense equipment and technology cooperation aimed at
ensuring Japan’s security and promoting international peace
and cooperation.
The MOD/SDF has long strived to alleviate any conditions
of confrontation and tension, and to foster a collaborative
and cooperative atmosphere by building face-to-face
relationships through bilateral dialogues and exchanges. In
addition, recognizing the increasing need for international
cooperation, Japan has recently enhanced bilateral
defense relationships from traditional exchanges to deeper
cooperation in a phased manner by appropriately combining
various means, including joint training and exercises
and capacity building assistance, defense equipment and


technology cooperation, and the development of institutional
frameworks such as the Acquisition and Cross-Servicing
Agreements (ACSA).
In addition, multilateral regional security cooperation and
dialogue are in the process of evolving from those that focus
on dialogue to those that focus on cooperation that seeks to
build regional order. It is important to promote bilateral and
multilateral defense cooperation and exchanges in a multilayered, practical manner in order to create an ideal security
environment.

**2** **Promotion of Defense Cooperation and Exchanges**


In promoting security cooperation and exchanges, it is
important to enhance bilateral defense cooperation and
exchanges using optimal combinations of various cooperative
means, taking into account regional situations, the situations
of recipient countries and their relationships with Japan.


1 Australia


Australia is a “Special Strategic Partner” for Japan in the IndoPacific region as both Japan and Australia are allied with the
United States and share not only universal values[3] but also
strategic stakes and interests. In recent years, particularly,

the ADF conduct operations together due to the further
advances in their defense cooperation and exchanges, and
the development of the Legislation for Peace and Security in
Japan. The agreement was approved by the National Diet in
April 2017 and put into force in September 2017. Relevant
domestic laws were developed then.
Japan will continue deepening its cooperative relationship
with Australia, a “Special Strategic Partner” that has both
the intention and ability to contribute to the maintenance of
peace and stability in the region jointly with Japan.

**(2) Recent Major Achievements in Defense Cooperation and**
**Exchanges**

In the eighth Japan-Australia “2+2” Foreign and Defense
Ministerial Consultations and the Defense Ministerial
Meeting in October 2018, the Ministers agreed to further
enhance bilateral security and defense cooperation as special
strategic partners that have shared fundamental values and
strategic interests concerning various issues faced by the
Indo-Pacific region. They also agreed to pursue stronger and
more concrete bilateral cooperation between the two defense
authorities in such areas as training, capacity building, and
defense equipment and technology cooperation. Moreover,
the two countries also reconfirmed that they will collaborate
in tackling North Korea-related issues, including illicit shipto-ship transfers involving North Korean-flagged vessels,
which have been banned under the United Nations (UN)
Security Council Resolutions. The Ministers also expressed
their serious concerns about coercive unilateral actions
that have been taken to seek to alter the status quo in the
East and South China Seas. In addition, they confirmed
their commitment to the earliest possible conclusion of
negotiations on the Reciprocal Access Agreement, which
would reciprocally improve administrative, policy, and
legal procedures to facilitate joint operations and exercises,
acknowledging its important role in further deepening the
bilateral security and defense cooperation.
In January 2019, then Australian Minister for Defence
Marise Payne visited Japan to have a Defense Ministerial
Meeting. During the meeting, Minister of Defense Iwaya
welcomed the third dispatch of Australian patrol aircraft
to address illicit ship-to-ship transfers, which took place in
December 2018. Moreover, the two Ministers welcomed the
steady progress in bilateral and Japan-U.S.-Australia joint
training of the ground, maritime, and air forces as well as the
progress in coordination and staff meetings for further joint


Japan-Australia “2+2” (October 2018)

Japan and Australia as responsible countries in the IndoPacific region are strengthening mutual cooperation focused
on areas such as humanitarian assistance and disaster relief
(HA/DR) activities and cooperation in capacity building
assistance.
Defense cooperation between Japan and Australia
started with cooperation in the United Nations Transitional
Authority in Cambodia (UNTAC). The two countries have
built up cooperation since then through the United Nations
Integrated Mission in Timor-Leste (UNMIT), Humanitarian
and Reconstruction Assistance in Iraq, the United Nations
Mission in the Republic of South Sudan (UNMISS), and
various international disaster relief operations. When the
Great East Japan Earthquake occurred in March 2011, the
Australian Defence Force (ADF) dispatched three out of its
four transport aircraft (C-17) to Japan to engage in a disaster
relief mission.
Against the background of the deepening defense
cooperation between Japan and Australia, the two countries
in March 2007 announced the Japan-Australia Joint
Declaration on Security Cooperation, Japan’s first such joint
declaration focusing on security with a country other than
the United States. Japan and Australia have also developed
the foundation for cooperation such as the ACSA, the
Japan-Australia Information Security Agreement, and the
Agreement between the Government of Japan and the
Government of Australia concerning the Transfer of Defence
Equipment and Technology .
Regarding the Japan-Australia ACSA,[4] a new agreement
for expanding the situations in which the provision of goods
and services is possible was signed by the two countries in
January 2017, followed by the establishment of relevant
laws and regulations. The new agreement was concluded
in light of the expansion of cases in which the SDF and

training. They also agreed to continue to deepen bilateral
defense cooperation in a concrete and practical manner.
On the occasion of the Shangri-La Dialogue in June
2019, Defense Minister Iwaya held the first Japan-Australia
Defense Ministerial Meeting with Minister for Defence
Linda Reynolds. Regarding bilateral defense cooperation,
the Ministers reviewed recent activities in such fields as joint
training and exercises, defense equipment and technology
cooperation, and capacity building assistance. They also
affirmed that in order to maintain and strengthen a free, open,
stable and prosperous Indo-Pacific, the defense authorities
of the two countries will continue to make efforts to further
deepen and expand bilateral defense cooperation.
In June 2019, the Japan-Australia Summit Meeting was
held. In regards to realizing a free and open Indo-Pacific,
the Prime Ministers agreed to further collaborate in the
field of aid for capacity building in maritime security and
others in Southeast Asia as well as the Pacific Island
countries. Furthermore, the leaders exchanged views on the
promotion of security cooperation, and regional issues such
as North Korea, and shared the view to continue their close
collaboration.
As for bilateral service-to-service cooperation and
exchanges, a Japan-Australia bilateral cruising exercise was
held in the northern waters of Australia in September 2018.
In January 2019, the MSDF Chief of Staff visited Australia
to meet Chief of Navy Michael Noonan. In the meeting, they
reconfirmed that they pursue the same values, including the
freedom of oceans, and maintenance of international order by
the rule of law. They also agreed on further enhancement of
maritime exchanges, including mutual visits of naval ships.
In February 2019, the Chief of Joint Staff made an official
visit to Australia and met Chief of the Defence Force Angus
Campbell . They exchanged their opinions regarding the free
and open Indo-Pacific vision as well as SDF’s efforts for the
peace and stability of the region, which will contribute to the
above vision. In February 2019, the Air Self-Defense Force
(ASDF) Chief of Staff attended the Australian International
Airshow and met Air Marshal Leo Davies, Chief of Air
Force, Royal Australian Air Force, to talk about the regional
situations and bilateral defense cooperation and exchanges.
In addition, the ASDF sent an ASDF C-2 transport aircraft to
the Airshow, holding this aircraft’s first overseas exhibition
flight.

with Australia [Past Three Years])


and share universal values. They cooperate closely to resolve
the various challenges facing the Asia-Pacific region and the
international community. In order to ensure the effectiveness
and efficiency of such cooperation, it is important for Japan
and Australia to proactively promote trilateral cooperation
with the United States, whose presence is indispensable for
regional peace and stability.
The Security and Defense Cooperation Forum (SDCF),
a Director General-level meeting among the three countries
of Japan, the United States and Australia, has met ten times
since April 2007.
At an SDCF meeting held in October 2016, the three
countries’ defense authorities signed a Trilateral Information
Sharing Agreement to expedite their sharing of classified
information for cooperative activities regarding joint
exercises and operations among the three countries. They
plan to utilize this agreement to further deepen their
collaboration.
In June 2019, Defense Minister Iwaya held a Japan-U.S.Australia Defense Ministerial Meeting with then acting U.S.
Secretary of Defense Shanahan and Australian Minister for
Defence Reynolds on the occasion of the Shangri-La Dialogue,
the three Ministers were united in shared commitment to do
more together in support of the Indo-Pacific region. The
three Ministers also agreed on the Strategic Action Agenda,
which articulates their shared long-term vision for trilateral
cooperation in the Indo-Pacific region.
Japan, the United States and Australia have also carried
out trilateral exercises by service branch. In May 2019,
for example, the Ground Self-Defense Force (GSDF)
participated in the field training Southern Jackaroo with the
United States and Australia in Australia.
In November 2018, the MSDF hosted a Japan-U.S.Australia trilateral exercise (a special mine warfare exercise)
with three minesweepers from the United States and Australia
in waters east of Japan’s Kyushu Island. In August 2018,
Japan, Australia, Canada, and New Zealand held a cruising
exercise in Guamanian and Australian waters.
The ASDF participated in Japan-U.S.-Australia trilateral
HA/DR exercise “Christmas Drop” in the Federal States of
Micronesia in December 2018. From February to March
2019, the ASDF cohosted a Japan-U.S.-Australia trilateral
exercise “Cope North Guam” and a trilateral HA/DR
exercise.
Through various training and exercise opportunities, Japan
will continue its efforts to improve mutual understanding
and interoperability among Japan, the United States, and
Australia. In addition, Japan will also work to promote
quadrilateral defense cooperation among Japan, the United
States, Australia, and India.

agreements have strengthened the relationship between the
two partners, which are capable of dealing with regional and
global issues, as well as the foundation of this partnership.
**b. Recent Major Achievements in Defense Cooperation and**
**Exchanges**
At the Japan-India Summit Meeting in October 2018,
Japan and India agreed to further deepen bilateral security
and defense cooperation, to tap into new consultation
frameworks, such as Japan-India 2+2 Ministerial dialogues,
in addition to existing ones (such as annual Defence
Ministerial Dialogues), and to commence negotiations
on the Japan-India ACSA, which will contribute to the
strategic enhancement of bilateral defense cooperation.
Moreover, in October 2018, the MSDF and the Indian Navy
exchanged the signed Implementing Arrangement between
the Japan Maritime Self-Defense Force and the Indian
Navy Concerning Deeper Cooperation to promote maritime
security cooperation (including information sharing), with
the attendance of the leaders of the two nations.
In the Japan-India Annual Defence Ministerial Meeting
held in August 2018, the Ministers reaffirmed the importance
of the security and stability of the Indian Ocean and the Pacific
in achieving the peace and prosperity of the Indo-Pacific
region. Based on this shared understanding, they agreed to
cooperate with each other in ensuring maritime security and
in helping other countries in the region with capacity building,
and to promote bilateral service-to-service cooperation and
exchanges in a more concrete and effective manner. As for
defense equipment and technology cooperation, Japan and
India launched the Cooperative Research on the Visual

**a. Significance of Defense Cooperation and Exchanges with**
**India**
India is growing more influential against a backdrop of
its population—the world’s second largest—, its high
economic growth, and its latent economic power. Located
in the center of sea lanes that connect Japan with the Middle
East and Africa, India is an extremely important country
geopolitically for Japan. Furthermore, Japan and India share
universal values as well as common interests in the peace,
stability, and prosperity of Asia and the world, and have
established the “Special Strategic and Global Partnership.”
In this context, Japan and India have promoted cooperation
in maritime security and various other areas, while utilizing
some frameworks including the “2+2” dialogues.
Defense cooperation and exchanges between Japan and
India have steadily deepened since October 2008, when
the two countries signed the Joint Declaration on Security
Cooperation between Japan and India. Meetings and
consultations at various levels such as the ministerial and
Chief of Staff levels, as well as service-to-service exchanges
including bilateral and multilateral exercises, have been
regularly conducted. Moreover, the two countries signed
the Memorandum on Defence Cooperation and Exchanges
between the Ministry of Defense of Japan and the Ministry of
Defence of the Republic of India in September 2014 and saw
the conclusion of the Agreement between the Government of
Japan and the Government of the Republic of India concerning

**Deepening Cooperation between MSDF and Indian Navy**

Japan depends on seaborne trade for the majority of its economic activities, including the import of itemsnecessary for
people’s lives. The stability of the Indo-Pacific, with its major sea lanes of communication (SLOC), is especially vital
for Japan. Looking at the Indian Ocean in particular, it is becoming more important day by day for Japan to strengthen
coopration with India, which is a major power in the region, with its increased presence in terms of economy and security.
The MSDF has strengthened its cooperative relationship with the Indian Navy through Japan-U.S.-India joint exercise
Malabar, Japan-India bilateral exercise JIMEX,* and other initiatives. In recent years the scope of cooperation has been
expanding to include port calls of MSDF P-1 patrol aircraft to India for a joint anti-submarine exercise.
In light of the situation, in order to further enhance information sharing and joint exercises, the MSDF developed the
Implementing Arrangement for Deeper Cooperation between the MSDF and the Indian Navy with the aim of promoting and
developing broad maritime security cooperation. The agreement was signed at the time of the Japan-India Summit Meeting
in October 2018. The MSDF and the Indian Navy will pursue further strengthening of their cooperative relationship under
the agreement.
The deepening of the cooperation will directly contribute to the maintenance and enhancement of a free and open IndoPacific and eventually will lead to further stability and prosperity in Japan.

As a follow-up to this event, Japanese companies visited the
Indian national defense industry in August 2018. In February
2019, the second round of the Forum was held.
As for service-to-service exchanges, the Chief of Joint
Staff attended the Raisina Dialogue, a multilateral forum
held in India in January 2019. At this forum, he explained
the importance of international cooperation based on
universal values (such as the rule of law and the freedom
of navigation) in achieving a free and open Indo-Pacific. In
December 2018, Air Chief Marshal Birender Singh Dhanoa,
Chief of the Air Staff, Indian Air Force, visited Japan to meet
the Chief of Air Staff to exchange opinions on a wide range
of topics, including the situation of the region and bilateral

defense cooperation and exchanges.
Japan and India have also expanded service-to-service
exchanges through training and exercises. In November
2018, the GSDF and the Indian Army had their first bilateral
exercise, Dharma Guardian 2018, with a focus on counterterrorism operations. In December 2018, the ASDF dispatched
transport aircraft to its first bilateral exercise with the Indian
Air Force, SHINYUU Maitri 18. Having completed these
exercises, Japan and India have now conducted bilateral
exercises for all of the three military services, which helped
not only to improve the forces’ tactical skills but also enhance
mutual understanding and trust between the two countries
and strengthened the Japan-India relationship.
As trilateral initiatives among Japan, the United Sates, and
India, the MSDF joined the training for anti-air and anti-sea
operations in Japan-U.S.-India trilateral exercise Malabar

2018 conducted in the waters and airspace surrounding
Guam in June 2018. The three countries also conducted an
exercise (anti-mine operations and minesweeping special
drills) in Mutsu Bay in July 2018. In December 2018, the
ASDF joined the U.S.-India bilateral exercise Cope India for
the first time as an observer.
Following the first Japan-U.S.-India Summit Meeting
held in December 2018, the second Japan-U.S.-India Summit
Meeting was held in June 2019, and the leaders reaffirmed
the critical importance of their trilateral cooperation in efforts
to maintain and promote a free and open Indo-Pacific region,
sharing their understanding of an increasingly complex
security situation. Furthermore, the three leaders confirmed
their views to further promote the trilateral cooperation
in various fields, such as maritime security, space and
cyberspace.

**(2) Sri Lanka**
In the similar manner as India, Sri Lanka is a country of great
geopolitical importance. In recent years, Japan has proactively
worked to strengthen bilateral defense cooperation and
exchanges with Sri Lanka. In November 2017, Sri Lankan
State Minister of Defense Ruwan Wijewardene visited Japan
and paid a courtesy call on then Defense Minister Onodera,
exchanging their views on cooperation in the improvement
of maritime surveillance capabilities and in search and
rescue operations. In August 2018, then Defense Minister
Onodera made the first visit to Sri Lanka as a Japanese
Defense Minister. He met Sri Lankan President Maithripala
Sirisena and Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe. In
these meetings, he agreed to further strengthen the bilateral
partnership with Sri Lanka as an important maritime nation
located on the Indian Ocean sea lanes. He also toured the
Port of Colombo and the Port of Hambantota. During this
visit, the first-ever Defense Ministerial Meeting between the
two countries was also held between then Defense Minister
Onodera and Sri Lankan State Minister of Defense Ruwan
Wijewardene, in which they exchanged their opinions on
maritime security and safety. The Sri Lankan State Minister
of Defense also expressed the country’s hope to improve
the capabilities of the Sri Lanka Armed Forces as a whole
through capacity building of the three military services in
the HA/DR field, for which then Defense Minister Onodera
expressed his support.
As for service-to-service exchanges, the MSDF and the Sri
Lanka Navy held a goodwill training at the Port of Colombo
and in its surrounding sea and airspace in October 2018 as
part of MSDF Indo Southeast Asia Deployment.
As for capacity building assistance, the SDF held a
seminar for Sri Lankan Navy medical officers in June 2018 to


explain its training for medical officers. In October 2018, the
MSDF held a seminar on search and rescue operations when
it visited the Port of Colombo during the abovementioned
deployment. After that, the MSDF conducted the Ship-Rider
Cooperation Program for young Sri Lankan officers on the
way to Visakhapatnam. Furthermore, the MSDF and the Sri
Lanka Navy conducted goodwill training on search and rescue
operations at the Port of Colombo and in its surrounding
waters and airspace. By combining these seminars and
training exercises, the MSDF effectively contributed to the
improvement of the practical search and rescue capabilities
of the Sri Lanka Navy. In February 2019, the MOD invited
the Sri Lanka Air Force to Japan and provided training for
the air rescue unit and others.

3 Association of South-East Asian Nations(ASEAN)


ASEAN member states, which continue to experience high
economic growth and gather international attention for their
potential as an open growth center of the world, and Japan
have been traditional partners sharing a history of exchanges
and a close economic relationship over the past nearly 50
years.
ASEAN nations, located in geopolitically important
areas occupying strategic points on sea lanes of Japan, are
also playing an important role in ensuring the peace and
prosperity of Japan as well as the entire region. Therefore,
it is important for Japan to strengthen cooperation in the
security and defense areas and promote confidence with
ASEAN member states, while supporting their efforts to
enhance the centrality and unity of ASEAN, which is the
center of regional cooperation.
Based on this principle, Japan is promoting confidencebuilding and mutual understanding through high-level and
working-level exchanges as well as practical cooperation,
such as capacity building assistance, joint training, and
defense equipment and technology cooperation with ASEAN
member states. In addition to bilateral cooperation, Japan has
strengthened cooperation under multilateral frameworks such
as the ASEAN Defence Ministers’ Meeting-Plus (ADMMPlus) and ASEAN Regional Forum (ARF). At the second
ASEAN-Japan Defence Ministers’ Informal Meeting in Laos
in November 2016, then Defense Minister Inada announced
the “Vientiane Vision” as a guideline for the Japan-ASEAN
defense cooperation going forward. The vision provided an
overall picture of the priority areas of the future direction of
defense cooperation with ASEAN as a whole in a transparent
manner for the first time and was welcomed by all ASEAN
member states.
From the viewpoint of actively promoting such bilateral

and multilateral cooperation and stabilizing the security

strengthen defense cooperation and exchanges with ASEAN
member states.

shared the policy to promote Japan-Vietnam defense
cooperation in a broad range of fields based on the Joint
Vision Statement on Japan-Vietnam Defense Cooperation,
which was announced last year. Regarding the regional
situation, they agreed to cooperate toward denuclearization
of North Korea, shared concerns about the unilateral moves
to change the status quo and establish the change as a fait
accompli, and agreed that Japan and Vietnam should closely
work together on these issues. In addition, a memorandum on
the orientation of promotion of defense industry cooperation
was signed by the defense authorities of Japan and Vietnam
at the vice-ministerial level. The two countries agreed to
promote bilateral cooperation on defense equipment and
technology based on this memorandum. Furthermore, at
the Japan-Vietnam Leaders’ Working Lunch held in July
2019, the leaders agreed on commencing negotiations for an
agreement concerning the transfer of defense equipment and

**(3) Singapore**
In December 2009, Singapore became the first country in
Southeast Asia to sign a memorandum on defense exchanges
with Japan. The year 2019 marks the 10th anniversary of
the signing of the memorandum. Since then, the cooperative
relationship, including port calls, has been progressing
steadily based on the memorandum. Singapore and Japan
have so far conducted 15 regular meetings between their
defense authorities. Moreover, the two countries actively
conduct high-level defense exchanges as Japan’s Minister
of Defense attends the Shangri-La Dialogue organized by
the International Institute for Strategic Studies (IISS) almost
every year to explain Japan’s security policy.
In May 2019, the Japan-Singapore Defense Ministerial
Meeting was held with Minister for Defense Ng Eng Hen to
exchange opinions on the progress of the regional situation,
including North Korea issues, and bilateral/mulitilateral and
Japan-ASEAN defense cooperation.

At the Japan-Philippines Summit Meeting in September
2016, Prime Minister Abe and President Duterte agreed on the
transfer of MSDF TC-90 training aircraft to the Philippines
in order to enhance its capabilities in HA/DR, transportation,
and maritime situational awareness. At the Japan-Philippines
Summit Meeting in January 2017, the two countries agreed
that they would promote defense cooperation in various fields
such as capacity building assistance, defense equipment
cooperation, and training and exercises.
In March 2017, two MSDF TC-90 training aircraft were
transferred to the Philippine Navy in March 2017. At the
Japan-Philippines Defense Ministerial Meeting in October
2017, Japan announced that the mode of transfer of TC90 would be changed from lease to grant. In March 2018,
the remaining three TC-90 aircraft were transferred to the
Philippine Navy, completing the grant of a total of five TC90 aircraft. This transfer also covers training for Philippine
Navy pilots and maintenance support for Philippine Navy
maintenance personnel. Moreover, at the Japan-Philippines
Defense Ministerial Meeting held on the sidelines of the
Shangri-La Dialogue in June 2018, Japan confirmed that
it would grant GSDF’s decommissioned UH-1H parts and
maintenance equipment to the Philippine Air Force. In March
2019, the turnover of the parts and maintenance equipment
commenced with the transfer ceremony attended by StateMinister of Defense Harada.
At the Japan-Philippines Defense Ministerial Meeting
in April 2019, the two Ministers welcomed the progress
in cooperation, including the grant of TC-90s and UH-1H
parts and maintenance equipment, and its contributions to
the improvement of HA/DR and surveillance capabilities of
the Philippines. They also confirmed the progress in JapanPhilippines defense cooperation, including port calls, in a
broad range of fields and agreed that the two countries will
further strengthen defense cooperation in the future.
High-level exchanges between Japan and the Philippines
have also been deepening. Following his boarding on
Destroyer JS “Izumo” in June 2017, President Rodrigo
Duterte came aboard Destroyer JS “Kaga” during a call at
the Port of Subic in September 2018 to meet Parliamentary
Vice-Minister of Defense Ono and exchange opinions on the
bilateral relationship.
As for recent service-to-service cooperation and
exchanges, three MSDF destroyers, which were on the Indo
Southeast Asia Deployment, conducted a bilateral exercise
(search and rescue exercise) with the Philippine Navy in the
waters and airspace surrounding Palawan, the Philippines,


in September 2018. In addition, GSDF units participated in
the U.S.-Philippines joint exercise Kamandag 18 conducted
on the Philippine island of Luzon in September and October
2018. In March 2019, the GSDF Chief of Staff visited the
Philippines to meet Commanding General of the Philippine
Army Macairog Alberto and Commandant of the Philippine
Marine Corps Alvin Parreño. The three leaders agreed
to further strengthen defense cooperation and exchanges
between the GSDF and the Philippines Army and Marine
Corps. In the same month, Lieutenant General Rozzano D.
Briguez, Commanding General of the Philippine Air Force,
visited Japan to meet the ASDF Chief of Staff and exchanged
opinions on various topics, including regional situations and
defense cooperation and exchanges, deepening the mutual
understanding between the air forces of the two countries.
Furthermore, in June 2019, the ASDF Chief of Staff visited
the Philippines to participate in the Air Force Symposium
hosted by the Philippine Air Force. He had talks and opinion
exchanges with military personnel including Commanding

ASDF has implemented seminars on aviation safety and
international aviation law for Thailand since 2016. In March
2018, the GSDF conducted a seminar for the Royal Thai
Army planning to send a unit to the UNMISS, which covered
the characteristics of the UNMISS Command, engineering
missions, and other matters. Through the seminar, the SDF
shared its experiences and the lessons learnt with the Royal
Thai Army over five years of deployment to UNMISS. In
June 2018, the GSDF engineering unit supported the Royal
Thai Army’s preparation for PKO through training on the
maintenance and management of the water purification
system, which the GSDF transferred to the UN at no charge
when it withdrew from the UNMISS. In March 2019, the
ASDF provided capacity building assistance in the field of
aviation safety.

**(6) Cambodia**
In 1992, Cambodia became the first country to which
Japan sent an SDF unit for UN peacekeeping operations.
As indicated by Japan’s capacity building assistance
for Cambodia since 2013 and other programs, defense
cooperation and exchanges between the two countries have
made steady progress. At the Japan-Cambodia Summit
Meeting in December 2013, the bilateral relationship was

**(1) Significance of Japan-ROK Defense Cooperation and**
**Exchanges**

Both Japan and the ROK confront wide-ranging complex
security challenges, including response to the nuclear
and missile issues of North Korea, response to large-scale
natural disasters, counterterrorism measures, counter piracy
measures, maritime security, and peacekeeping operations.
The MOD/SDF plans to continue defense cooperation with
the ROK, including in a broad range of fields, and to make
efforts to establish a foundation for mutual coordination in
order to effectively address the above security challenges.
On the other hand, negative actions by the ROK side are
affecting Japan-ROK defense cooperation and exchange.
As an example, the ROK’s action related to the flag of the
MSDF[6] at the time of an international fleet review held by the
ROK in October 2018 can be cited. It is legally prescribed[7]
that usually, MSDF ships should display a flag of the MSDF
at their stern. However, the ROK, as the host of the fleet
review, indicated a unilateral rule prohibiting the display of a
flag at either the bow or the stern, which cannot be accepted
under Japanese law. Despite repeated requests for a revision
of the rule from Japan, the ROK side refused to revise it.
As a result, Japan had to refrain from participating in the
international fleet review. In addition, in December 2018,
there was an incident in which a destroyer of the ROK Navy
directed fire control radar at a SDF aircraft.[8] The MOD/SDF
will continue to call on the ROK side to appropriately deal
with these matters.
In addition, in August 2019, the Government of the ROK
announced its intention to terminate the Japan-ROK General

Security of Military Information Agreement (GSOMIA).
Considering more severe circumstances surrounding
Japan, such as repeated missile launches by North Korea,
cooperation between Japan and the ROK, and between Japan,
the United States and the ROK is important. Nevertheless,
the Government of the ROK made such a decision, and
regarding this, Minister of Defense stated that he “can’t
help but feel disappointed, and it is extremely regrettable.”
He also said that regarding issues that call for cooperation,
including North Korea issues, Japan strongly urges the ROK
side to wisely respond to secure appropriate cooperation
between Japan and the ROK, and between Japan, the United
States and the ROK, even after this decision.

**(2) Recent Major Achievements in Defense Cooperation and**
**Exchanges**

**a. Overview**
Since 2015, Japan’s defense cooperation and exchanges with
the ROK have been implemented at various levels, including
ministerial and other high levels and unit levels.
In October 2018, Minister of Defense Iwaya met ROK
Minister of National Defense Jeong Kyeong-doo at the
fifth ADMM-Plus. In this meeting, they agreed to together
collaborate with the United States and the international
community according to the UN Security Council Resolutions
in order to pullout further actions from North Korea.
**b. Japan-ROK General Security of Military Information**
**Agreement (GSOMIA)**
Based on the Trilateral Information Sharing Arrangement
Concerning the Nuclear and Missile Threats Posed by North
Korea signed in December 2014, the defense authorities in
Japan and the ROK have exchanged and shared classified
information regarding North Korea’s nuclear weapons and
missiles via the United States. In light of the increasingly
serious situation surrounding North Korea with its frequently
repeated ballistic missile launches and nuclear tests, in
November 2016, the GSOMIA was concluded between
Japan and the ROK to further promote bilateral cooperation.
This agreement serves as a framework to appropriately
protect classified information shared between the Japanese
and ROK governments.
However, in August 2019, the Government of the ROK
notified the Government of Japan of its intention to terminate
the GSOMIA in writing.[9]


Exchanges [Past Three Years])

**(3) Japan-U.S.-ROK Cooperative Relationship**
Since Japan, the United States, and the ROK share common
interests pertaining to the peace and stability of this region,
it is important for the three countries to seize opportunities
to promote close cooperation in addressing various security
issues, including those regarding North Korea.
Japan, the United States, and the ROK have conducted
a Trilateral Defense Ministerial Meeting on the sidelines of
the Shangri-La Dialogue. In June 2019, Defense Minister
Iwaya, ROK Minister of National Defense Jeong Kyeongdoo, and U.S. Acting Secretary of Defense Patrick Shanahan
convened the Trilateral Defense Ministerial Meeting. The
three Ministers recognized the international community’s
shared goal of North Korea’s full compliance with its
international obligations in accordance with all relevant UN
Security Council Resolutions, which call for North Korea’s
complete denuclearization in a verifiable and irreversible
manner. They underscored commitment to cooperation and
coordination with the international community for fully
implementing UN Security Council Resolutions, including
sustained international cooperation to deter, disrupt, and
ultimately eliminate North Korea’s illicit ship-to-ship
transfers. Regarding regional security issues, the Ministers
reaffirmed that freedom of navigation and overflight must be
ensured, and that all disputes should be resolved in a peaceful
manner in accordance with the principles of international
law. Based on this view, they shared the recognition of
strengthening security cooperation between Japan, the
United States and the ROK.
At the working level, the three countries have coordinated
with each other while closely sharing information through
such opportunities as Director-General and Director level
meetings, video conferences, and chief-of-staff level
meetings based on the framework of the Japan-U.S.-ROK
Defense Trilateral Talks (DTT).
In May 2019, a Director-General-level plenary session
was held in Seoul. The three representatives engaged
in consultations on regional security issues including
North Korea. They committed to further trilateral security
cooperation and affirmed that they will promote information
sharing, high-level policy consultations, and combined
exercises.
At the chief of staff level, the Chief of Joint Staff visited
the United States in October 2018 to participate in the Japan

**Progress in Japan-U.K. Defense Cooperation – Participating in an Exercise with**
**British Army**

**First Lieutenant Nobuaki Fujiwara, Leader of Scouting Team, Reconnaissance School Unit of Fuji School Brigade**
**(Oyama Town, Suntou County, Shizuoka Prefecture)**

As the leader of a scouting team of the GSDF Reconnaissance School Unit, I participated in Vigilant Isles, the first field
training with the British Army carried out on Japanese soil, from late September to early October 2018. The exercise was
divided into two parts: training by function to improve the tactical techniques of individual members, and comprehensive
training to carry out reconnaissance activities under specific conditions during about six days, joint guided fire power, and
other activities. The first part was implemented at GSDF Fuji School (Shizuoka Prefecture) and North Fuji Maneuver Area
(Yamanashi Prefecture), while the comprehensive training was conducted in Ojihara Maneuver Area (Miyagi Prefecture).
The exercise was highly visibly reported in the media both in Japan and abroad.
Because this was the first bilateral exercise with a foreign army other than the United States on Japanese soil and also
because I was not familiar with exercises with foreign forces, I had difficulty with the arrangement of the daily exercise.
However, we completed the exercise successfully thanks to flexible responses by the members of the British Army.
During the exercise, we conducted various exercises, including infiltration into objective areas, reconnaissance/
surveillance, and joint guided fire power. These were very fruitful exercises where we learned many things. At the final
stage of the exercise, Japanese and British participants opened up to one another. After completing the exercise, we
exchanged personal items to commemorate our friendship and communicated with each other using gestures. It was a very
impressive exercise.
I will continue to make efforts to improve the skills of our unit by utilizing what I learned through the exercise.

three countries need to enhance their security cooperation
in various areas into the future, taking advantage of various
available opportunities.

5 European Countries, Canada, and New Zealand


European countries, Canada, and New Zealand share
universal values with Japan and play a central role in
initiatives to address common challenges to global security,
with a primary focus on non traditional security areas such as


counter-terrorism and combating illicit ship-to-ship transfers,
as well as international peace cooperation activities. In this
regard, promoting defense cooperation and exchanges with
these countries provides the foundations for Japan to become
actively involved in dealing with these challenges and is
important for all of Japan, European countries, Canada, and
New Zealand.

See Reference 43 (Recent Defense Cooperation and Exchanges
with European Countries, Canada and New Zealand [Past
Three Years])


**(1) The United Kingdom**
The United Kingdom, being a major power that has influence
not only in Europe but also in the rest of the world, has
historically maintained close relations with Japan. On the
security front, Japan shares the same strategic interests
as the United Kingdom, as both countries are important


-----

allies of the United States. Given this relationship, it is
extremely important for Japan to promote cooperation with
the United Kingdom by working together on global issues,
such as international peace cooperation activities, counterterrorism and counter-piracy operations and by exchanging
information on regional situations.
With regard to Japan’s relationship with the United
Kingdom, the Memorandum on Defence Cooperation was
signed in June 2012. Following this, Agreement on the
Transfer of Defence Equipment and Technology came into
effect in July 2013 and the Japan-U.K. Information Security
Agreement entered into force in January 2014, leading to
the development of a foundation for defense equipment
and technology cooperation as well as information sharing
between the two countries.
At the Japan-U.K. Summit Meeting in May 2014, prime
ministers of both countries agreed to hold a Japan-U.K.
“2+2” Foreign and Defence Ministerial Meeting and begin
negotiations on the ACSA in order to enhance bilateral
cooperation in the security field. Following this, the first
Japan-U.K. “2+2” Meeting was held in January 2015.
During the second Japan-U.K. “2+2” Meeting in January
2016, the two countries agreed to promote joint exercises,
cooperate in the defense equipment and technology areas and

**(1) Significance of Defense Exchanges and Cooperation with**
**China**

A stable relation between Japan and China is an essential
factor for the peace and stability of the Indo-Pacific region.
From broad and medium- to long-term perspectives, it is
necessary for both countries to strive to build and enhance
the “Mutually Beneficial Relationship Based on Common
Strategic Interests with China” in all areas, including security.
In the security field, in order to enhance mutual
understanding and trust, Japan will promote multi-layered
dialogues and exchanges with China. In doing so, Japan
will continue to encourage China to play a responsible,
constructive role for peace and stability in the Indo-Pacific
region, comply with international norms of conduct,
and improve transparency regarding military capability
enhancement in the context of its rapidly increasing defense
budget. Moreover, in order to avoid unexpected situations,
Japan will utilize the Maritime and Aerial Communication
Mechanism between the Defense Authorities of Japan and
China in a manner that contributes to building a trusting
relationship between the two countries.

**(2) Recent Major Achievements in Defense Exchanges**
Japan-China defense exchanges stagnated following the
Japanese government’s acquisition of ownership of the three
Senkaku Islands (Uotsurijima Island, Kitakojima Island,
and Minamikojima Island) in September 2012, but have
gradually resumed since the latter half of 2014.
In November 2015, Japan-China Defense Ministerial
Meeting was held for the first time in four years and five
months on the margins of the ADMM-Plus meeting. Then
Japanese Defense Minister Nakatani and Chinese Defense
Minister Chang Wanquan shared the recognition that it

China in September 2018 and April 2019 to pay courtesy
calls to important persons and toured the facilities of the
People’s Liberation Army.
In efforts to build a “Mutually Beneficial Relationship
Based on Common Strategic Interests,” Japan and China
must strive to promote confidential relations and mutual
understanding through dialogue at various levels in various
areas and must proactively step up concrete cooperation
in non-traditional security areas, such as counter-piracy
measures.

**(3) “Maritime and Aerial Communication Mechanism between**
**the Defense Authorities of Japan and China”**

At Japan-China Summit Meetings in January and April

and confidence between Japan and China and to enhance
bilateral defense cooperation; (2) to avoid unexpected
collisions; and (3) to prevent unforeseen circumstances
in the sea and air from developing into military clashes
or political or diplomatic issues. The mechanism’s main
components include (1) annual and expert meetings between
the two countries’ defense authorities; (2) a hotline between
Japanese and Chinese defense authorities; and (3) on scene
communication measures between vessels and aircraft of the
SDF and the People’s Liberation Army.
In December 2018, the Japanese and Chinese defense
authorities held annual and expert meetings on the above
Mechanism in Beijing, in which the leaders confirmed
that the Mechanism has been effectively utilized since its
launching and agreed to continue to use it in a way that

the Gulf of Aden, as well as the regular Japan-Russia Cyber
Security Meeting.
At the second Japan-Russia “2+2” Meeting in March
2017, the two countries exchanged opinions regarding the
regional situations among others. Concerning the activities
of the Russian Armed Forces, the Japanese side protested
against enhancing armaments, including the deployment of
surface to ship missiles on the Northern Territories and the
deployment of divisions on islands that may contain the Four
Northern Islands. Japan expressed regret that these activities
conflicted with Japan’s stance that the Northern territory is
an inherent part of the territory of Japan.

The Pacific Island countries are important countries that
share the importance of a free, open, and sustainable maritime
order based on the rule of law as maritime nations, as well as

Based on the proposal by Prime Minister Abe at the ASEANJapan Commemorative Summit in December 2013, the first
ASEAN-Japan Defence Ministers’ Informal Meeting took
place in Bagan, Myanmar, in November 2014. This meeting,
in which opinions were exchanged on cooperation in nontraditional security areas such as HA/DR and maritime
security, was a breakthrough opportunity bringing defense
ministers from Japan and the ASEAN member states
together for the first time in the history of nearly 50 years of
friendship and cooperation between Japan and ASEAN. This
marked an important first step towards strengthening defense
cooperation in the future.
In November 2016, the second ASEAN-Japan Defence
Ministers’ Informal Meeting was held in Vientiane, Laos. At
that meeting, then Defense Minister Inada announced Japan’s
own initiative called the “Vientiane Vision: Japan’s Defense
Cooperation Initiative with ASEAN” as a guideline for
Japan-ASEAN defense cooperation, which was welcomed
by all ASEAN member states.
The “Vientiane Vision” is the first of its kind to present
an overall picture of the priority areas of the future direction
of ASEAN-wide defense cooperation in a transparent
manner. Specifically, the vision that urges that cooperation
contributing to capacity building in each ASEAN country
and the entire ASEAN give priority to three points: (1)
consolidating the order based on the principles of international
law; (2) promoting maritime security; and (3) coping with
increasingly diversifying and complex security issues.
Based on the vision, Japan has promoted practical defense
cooperation with ASEAN by combining diverse measures
including: (1) promotion of international law to share
understanding and experience regarding international law;
(2) capacity building assistance; (3) defense equipment and
technology cooperation; (4) joint training and exercises; and
(5) human resource development and academic exchange.
Since the year after the announcement of the vision,
the Japan-ASEAN defense cooperation program has been
implemented every year. In the field of maritime security,
since 2017, Japan has invited participants in the JapanASEAN Ship Rider Cooperation Program from all ASEAN
nations and the ASEAN Secretariat. In June 2019, Japan
implemented the third Japan-ASEAN Ship Rider Cooperation
Program on MSDF Destroyer JS “Izumo,” which was sailing
from Brunei to the Philippines. Japan conducted seminars on
HA/DR and international law and international aviation law
related to maritime security.
In the field of HA/DR, since 2018, Japan has held the
Japan-ASEAN Invitation Program on HA/DR. In February
2019, Japan held the second round of the invitation program,
inviting participants from all ASEAN member states and

ADMM-Plus meeting (October 2018)


the ASEAN Secretariat. In this program, a seminar on the
Japanese large-scale disaster response guidelines and the
first table-top exercise were conducted.
In the field of international law, in November 2018, Japan
invited all ASEAN member states and the ASEAN Secretariat
to the Japan-ASEAN Symposium on International Law titled
“Regional Cooperation in the Indo-Pacific and the Rule of
Law.”
In October 2018, on the sidelines of the fifth ADMMPlus, the fourth ASEAN-Japan Defence Ministers’ Informal
Meeting was held. In this Meeting, Minister of Defense
Iwaya stated that more practical defense cooperation
between Japan and ASEAN would be even more important
as security issues in the Indo-Pacific region become more
diverse and complicated. As a specific measure to strengthen
such cooperation, Minister of Defense Iwaya announced that
the Professional Airmanship Program would be conducted
as a Japan-ASEAN cooperation program to build confidence
among air services and promote shared values to maintain
the rule of law, inviting air officers from all ASEAN
member states and the ASEAN Secretariat to Japan. ASEAN
welcomed the recent progress in Japan-ASEAN defense
cooperation achieved through various programs since the
Vientiane Vision was announced, and ASEAN agreed with
Japan to further promote practical defense cooperation going
forward.
Through these initiatives, Japan has worked to promote
capacity building assistance, mutual understanding, and
network building with participants from all ASEAN member
states through seminars and training programs in various
areas, including maritime security and HA/DR, while also
fostering a shared recognition about international law, which
has contributed to the stability of the Indo-Pacific region.

**(B) Japan-ASEAN Defense Vice-Ministerial Forum**
Since 2009, the MOD has annually held the Japan-ASEAN
Defense Vice-Ministerial Forum for the purpose of
strengthening bilateral and multilateral relationships through
the development of human networks between Japanese and
ASEAN vice-ministerial level officials.
In September 2017, the MOD held the tenth Japan-ASEAN
Defense Vice-Ministerial Forum in Nagoya, in which viceministerial level officials from all ASEAN member states
and the ASEAN Secretariat participated to exchange their
views on three themes: (1) efforts to share universal values,
including the rule of law and challenges; (2) measures for
disaster response and challenges; and (3) prospects for
Japan-ASEAN defense cooperation. The participants of the
Forum shared the view that, with threats becoming more
complicated and diverse, it is important to promote shared
universal values, including the rule of law, and improve
capabilities to respond to frequent disaster. They also agreed
that it is important for the defense authorities to work closely
with each other to this end.
**(C) Tokyo Defense Forum, Etc.**
The MOD has held the Asia-Pacific Defense Forum (Tokyo
Defense Forum) every year since 1996 for senior officials
in charge of defense policy (Director-General level officials
and general-level officers) from the countries in the region
to discuss defense policies of the participating countries and
confidence-building measures in the field of defense.
The 23rd Forum, held in March 2019, was attended by
28 countries that are mainly from the Indo-Pacific region
as well as the ASEAN Secretariat, the EU and International
Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC). The participants
discussed a wide range of matters in the context of the themes
of the Forum, “security issues in the Indo-Pacific region” and
“changing security challenges and prospects.”

U.S. Navy, visit countries in the Asia-Pacific region to
provide medical care, conduct facility repair activities,
and engage in cultural exchange to strengthen cooperation
between countries participating in the initiative and
facilitate international peace cooperation activities through
cooperation with governments, military forces, international
organizations, and nongovernmental organizations (NGOs)
in those countries.
Japan has dispatched SDF medical personnel and units
under the Pacific Partnership since 2007. In 2019, Japan
dispatched medical personnel to the Marshall Islands and
Vietnam, in addition to sending its music band members
to the Marshall Islands, for medical activities and cultural
exchanges. Moreover, Japan also sent lecturers on women’s
studies, peace, and security.

**(2) Multilateral Training and Exercises**
**(1) Significance of Multilateral Training and Exercises in the**
**Indo-Pacific Region**
In the Indo-Pacific region, the MOD/SDF has actively
participated in multilateral training and exercises in nontraditional security fields, such as HA/DR and Non-combatant
Evacuation Operation (NEO), in addition to traditional
training conducted in preparation for combat situations. It is
important to participate in such multilateral training so as not
only to raise the skill level of the SDF, but also to create a
cooperative platform with relevant countries. In light of this
perspective, the MOD/SDF intends to continue to actively
engage in such training.


**(2) Initiatives for Multilateral Exercises**
The multilateral relationships have recently shifted from the
phrase for building trust to the phrase for developing more
concrete and practical cooperative relationships. Various
multilateral training and exercises have been actively
conducted as important initiatives to effectively help this
shifting.
The SDF joined the multilateral exercise cohosted by
the United States and Thailand, Cobra Gold, from January
to February 2019. Specifically, the SDF participated in the
staff exercises on counter-piracy operations and cooperation
and assistance for foreign armies, the field training exercises
on rescuing Japanese nationals overseas, and humanitarian
and civilian assistance training (humanitarian assistance and
disaster relief department and engineering department).
The GSDF participated in a multilateral exercise, Khaan
Quest 18, in Mongolia in June 2018, and joined by 18
countries. In addition, the GSDF has hosted the Multinational
Cooperation Program in the Asia Pacific (MCAP) every year
since 2002 as part of its multilateral cooperation initiatives,
inviting officers from relevant countries. In November
2018, the North Eastern Army conducted the large-scale
disaster response exercise, Michinoku ALERT 2018, with
participants from 15 countries to share knowledge in the HA/
DR field.
The MSDF participated in Rim of the Pacific Joint
Exercise (RIMPAC) 2018, a multilateral exercise hosted by
the United States Navy and joined by 26 countries, in the
surrounding waters of Hawaii and California from June to
August 2018. In August 2018, the MSDF participated in the
multilateral exercise Kakadu 2018 hosted by the Australian
Navy in the surrounding waters and airspace of Australia.

The MOD/SDF’s capacity building assistance programs
are aimed at improving the capabilities of recipient countries
in a concrete and steady manner over a certain period
of time. Some programs are carried out by dispatching
MOD/SDF officials to the recipient country, by inviting
recipient country’s officials to Japan, or by a combination
of both. With the first method, SDF officials with technical
knowledge are dispatched to the recipient country to help
the recipient country’s forces and their related organizations
through seminars, field training, and technical guidance.
With the second method, the recipient country’s officials
are invited to the MOD/SDF’s units and institutions to learn
human resources development, education, and training that
the MOD/SDF provides through seminars, field training, and
observing the education and training programs.

programs conducted by means of dispatch was 137 (13
countries, 23 officials), and the number of those conducted
by means of invitation was 63 (7 countries, 9 trainees).
Under the dispatch programs, the MOD/SDF has
provided technical assistance on engineering activities, such
as road construction in Mongolia, which builds on previous
assistance, and engineering assistance for the Harii Hamutuk
training program sponsored by Australian forces in TimorLeste. Japan has also provided support for a military band in
Papua New Guinea, which served in 2018 as the chair of the
APEC forum. This program was conducted in coordination
with MOFA’s assistance, which involved the granting of
new musical instruments through Official Development
Assistance (ODA) and the dispatch of Japan International
Cooperation Agency (JICA) experts. On a made-bygovernment basis, Japan thus supported the establishment
and training of the military band of the Papua New Guinea
Defense Force. The band gave an excellent performance in

1 Objectives of Capacity Building Assistance


In today’s security environment, no country can maintain
its peace and stability on its own. It is indispensable for
the international community to unite to resolve global
issues. The defense authorities of Southeast Asian and other
countries have either requested the MOD to provide capacity
building assistance, or expressed their expectations for such
cooperation. In response to such expectations, the MOD/
SDF started to provide capacity building assistance in the
security and defense areas in 2012.
Providing assistance for capacity building has the
following objectives: (1) creating an ideal of a more
advantageous security environment for Japan by cooperating
with recipient countries in the Indo-Pacific and other regions
to help with the steady development of their own capacity
building initiatives, develop in a steady manner, and enabling
the recipient countries’ forces to play adequate roles in
maintaining international peace and regional stability; (2)
strengthening bilateral relationships with recipient countries;
(3) strengthening relationships with other donor countries,
such as the United States and Australia; and (4) promoting
Japan’s efforts to work proactively and independently to
realize regional peace and stability, and to gain trust in the
MOD/SDF and Japan as a whole. Capacity building assistance
initiatives also facilitate the improvement of SDF capabilities.
The MOD/SDF will implement capacity building
assistance programs effectively by carefully coordinating
with diplomatic policies and combining various means to
maximize effects, while also tapping into the knowledge
accumulated at the SDF.

2 Specific Activities


The MOD/SDF has provided capacity building assistance in such
areas as HA/DR, PKO, and maritime security to 15 countries
and one organization in the Asia-Pacific and other regions.

In addition, as part of capacity building assistance for
Africa, the MOD/SDF implemented from October to
December 2018 a program for supporting the enhancement
of disaster response capacity for Djibouti forces, including
education on how to operate engineering equipment, such as
hydraulic shovels, graders, and dozers, in order to strengthen
the bilateral relationship.

3 Cooperation with Partner Countries


In efforts to stabilize the regional security environment,
Japan’s cooperation with other donor countries is essential.
In particular, Japan’s capacity building cooperation with
the United States, Australia and the United Kingdom is
considered a priority.

**Relief Capabilities of ASEAN**

**Senior Fellow Tomohiko Satake, Policy Simulation Division under the Director of Policy Simulation, National**
**Institute for Defense Studies (Shinjuku Ward, Tokyo)**

On January 30, 2019, I participated as a facilitator in a tabletop exercise on Japan-ASEAN Humanitarian Assistance and
Disaster Relief (Japan-ASEAN HA/DR Table Top Exercise [TTX]) conducted at the National Institute for Defense Studies.
I was also involved in the agenda setting and scenario drafting for the TTX. The TTX was part of the 2nd Japan-ASEAN
Invitation Program on Humanitarian Assistance and Disaster Relief (HA/DR) hosted by the International Policy Division,
inviting military and other participants from all ASEAN member states. Its purpose was to familiarize participants with the
Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) of the Multinational Coordination Center (MNCC) developed by initiatives taken by
Japan and Laos in preparation for disasters.
In recent years, ASEAN has been exploring joint disaster relief operation, including the establishment of ASEAN
Militaries Ready Group on HA/DR, which specializes in HA/DR. In order to support the united approaches of ASEAN, this
TTX discussed specific operations of SOP based on a scenario assuming typhoon damage in the region in three phases: (1)
immediately after the disaster; (2) a week after the disaster; and (3) the period of withdrawal of assisting countries.
Through the day-long discussion, both Japanese and ASEAN participants were able to deepen their understanding of the
roles assigned by SOP to individual groups and MNCC operations. This was a wonderful opportunity for me as a researcher
to experience defense diplomacy directly. I strongly hope that the TTX will contribute to the improvement of joint disaster
relief operations in the region and to the strengthening of Japan-ASEAN relations.

Committee (SCC) in April 2015 states that the two countries
would strengthen their continued close coordination on
cooperation including capacity building assistance to
realize peace, stability, and prosperity in the region. The
two ministers agreed to promote defense cooperation with
Southeast Asian countries, including capacity building
assistance.
Under a Japan-Australia personnel exchange program,
the MOD has received an official from the Australian
Department of Defense to its International Policy Division’s
Capacity Building Office four times since 2013. In exchange,
the MOD has dispatched an official to the Australian
Department of Defense three times since 2015. In November
2017, Japan and Australia held the first working group on
capacity building assistance.
Japan has also cooperated with the United States and
Australia in providing capacity building assistance to TimorLeste. The SDF and the U.S. forces participated in the Harii


Hamutuk capacity building assistance program sponsored
by the Australian forces in Timor-Leste four times since
October 2015, providing technical guidance on engineering,
including construction for engineering units of the TimorLeste forces.
In the joint statement issued for the third Japan-UK
Foreign and Defense Ministerial Meeting in December
2017, Japan and the United Kingdom welcomed progress of
coordination of capacity building in developing countries in
Southeast Asia, South Asia, the Middle East and Africa, and
shared the view to use a coordination mechanism for future
joint capacity building in strategic priorities such as maritime
security, counterterrorism, cybersecurity, HA/DR.
It is important for Japan and other countries providing
capacity building assistance to conduct such assistance
effectively and efficiently by closely coordinating with and
mutually complementing each other.

**2** **Ensuring Maritime Security**


The NDPG states that for Japan, a maritime nation,
strengthening the order of “Open and Stable Oceans” based
on fundamental norms, such as the rule of law and the
freedom of navigation, as well as ensuring safe maritime and
air transport, is the foundation for its peace and prosperity,
which is extremely important. From this viewpoint, the
MOD/SDF will promote assistance that contributes to
improving capabilities pertaining to the maritime security
of coastal states in the Indo-Pacific region, such as India,

**1** **Counter-Piracy Operations**


Piracy is a grave threat to public safety and order on the
seas. In particular, for Japan, which depends on maritime
transportation to import most of the resources and food
necessary for its survival and prosperity as a maritime nation,
it is an important issue that cannot be ignored.


Sri Lanka, and other South and Southeast Asian states.
Moreover, Japan will promote such activities as joint training
and exercises, unit-to-unit exchanges, and active port visits
on these occasions. Japan will also conduct activities such
as anti-piracy efforts in cooperation with relevant countries
and cooperation for strengthening the capabilities of the
Maritime Domain Awareness (MDA).

States, have dispatched their warships to the waters off
the coast of Somalia and in the Gulf of Aden. As part of
its counter-piracy initiatives, the EU has been conducting
Operation Atalanta since December 2008, in addition to the
counter-piracy operations conducted by the Combined Task
Force 151 (CTF 151)[2] that was established in January 2009.
Meanwhile, other countries have been dispatching their
assets to the area. The international community continues to
have a critical interest in and take actions to tackle the acts
of piracy off the coast of Somalia and in the Gulf of Aden.
As these initiatives by the international community have
proved to be effective, the number of acts of piracy occurring
in the waters off the coast of Somalia and in the Gulf of Aden
has currently hovered at a low level. However, the assumed
root causes of piracy such as terrorism and poverty in Somalia
have still remained unsolved. In addition, considering the
fact that Somalia’s capability to crack down on piracy is also
still insufficient, if the international community reduces its
counter-piracy efforts, the situation could be easily reversed.
Therefore, there is no great change in the situation in which
Japan must carry out its counter-piracy operations.

**Chapter**


1 Basic Concept


The Japan Coast Guard (JCG), one of the law enforcement
agencies in Japan, is primarily responsible for coping with
piracy. However, in cases where it is deemed extremely
difficult or impossible for the JCG to cope with piracy by
itself, the SDF is to take action as well.

2 Circumstances Surrounding Incidents of Piracy and
Initiatives by the International Community


For Japan and the international community, the waters off
the coast of Somalia and in the Gulf of Aden are extremely
important sea lanes, connecting Europe and the Middle East
with East Asia. Successive United Nations Security Council
resolutions[1] were adopted, such as United Nations Security
Council Resolution 1816, which was adopted in June 2008
in response to the frequent occurrence of and rapid increase
in the piracy incidents with the purpose of acquiring ransoms
by detaining hostages caused by pirates, who are armed with
machine guns and rocket launchers. These resolutions have
requested that various countries take actions, particularly the
dispatch of warships and military aircraft, to deter piracy in
the waters off the coast of Somalia and in the Gulf of Aden.
To date, approximately 30 countries, including the United

**b. Deployment Air Force for Counter Piracy Enforcement**
The Deployment Air Force for Counter Piracy Enforcement
(DAPE) conducts counterpiracy activities using the MSDF
P-3C patrol aircraft (two aircraft dispatched). The unit
conducts warning and surveillance operations in the flight
zone that is determined in coordination with the CTF 151
headquarters and confirms any suspicious boats. At the
same time, the unit also provides information to the MSDF
destroyers, the naval vessels of other countries and civilian
vessels, responding by such means as confirming the safety
of the surrounding area immediately, if requested. The
information gathered by MSDF P-3Cs is constantly shared
with other related organizations, and contributes significantly
to deterring acts of piracy and disarming vessels suspected of
being pirate ships.
**c. Deployment Support Group for Counter Piracy Enforcement**
In order to improve the operational efficiency and
effectiveness of the DAPE, the Deployment Support Group
for Counter Piracy Enforcement (DGPE) carries out activities
such as maintenance of the facility set up in the northwest
district of Djibouti International Airport.

Operations for the purpose of protecting Japan-affiliated
vessels from acts of piracy in the waters off the coast of
Somalia and in the Gulf of Aden, two MSDF destroyers[3]
began providing direct escort to Japan-affiliated vessels,
while MSDF P-3C patrol aircraft also commenced warning
and surveillance operations in June the same year.
In view of the United Nations Convention on the Law
of the Sea, Japan subsequently enacted the Anti-Piracy
Measures Act[4] in July the same year in order to deal
appropriately and effectively with acts of piracy. This act
made it possible to protect the vessels of all nations from
acts of piracy, regardless of their flag states. Moreover, it
also enabled the use of weapons to a reasonable extent, if no
other means were available, in order to halt vessels engaging
in acts of piracy, such as approaching civilian vessels.
Furthermore, the Act on Special Measures concerning the
Security of Japanese Flagged Vessels in Areas that Are Highly
Susceptible to Acts of Piracy came into force on November
2013, which made it possible to have security guards on board
a Japanese ship provided certain requirements are met, enabling
them to carry small arms for the purpose of security operations.

destroyers, which are engaging in counter-piracy operations
off the coast of Somalia and in the Gulf of Aden, has received
many messages from the captains and ship owners of the
vessels that its units have escorted, expressing their gratitude
that the ships were able to cross the Gulf of Aden with
peace of mind and asking them to continue escorting ships
there. Additionally, The Japanese Shipowners’ Association
and other groups expressed appreciation for protection of
Japan-related vessels and asked for continuation of efforts in
fighting against piracy.

**2** **Training-Centered Initiatives**


The MSDF not only endeavors to enhance its tactical skills
through joint training with coastal states alongside sea
lanes, but also strives to contribute to peace and stability in
the Indo-Pacific region, promote mutual understanding, and
strengthen relationships of trust. Recently, the Indo Southeast
Asia Deployment, consisting of three destroyers including
Destroyer JS “Kaga,” carried out training with India and Sri
Lanka, among others, during a lengthy deployment to the
Indo-Pacific region between August and October 2018. Three
destroyers, including Destroyer JS “Izumo,” also conduct


Indo-Pacific Deployment in 2019. The vessels also made a
number of port calls timed to coincide with this training.
Strengthening cooperation with coastal states of the
Indo-Pacific region through the joint training and port calls
contributes to the maintenance of maritime security, which
has extremely high significance.

**3** **Cooperation in Use of Space and Cyber Domains**


In the international community, there is a broadening and
diversifying array of security challenges that cannot be
dealt with by a single country alone. Rapid expansion in the
use of space and cyber domains is poised to fundamentally
change the existing paradigm of national security, which
makes the establishment of international rules and norms a
security agendum. The MOD/SDF will, based on the NDPG,


**Chapter**


swiftly achieve superiority in space and cyber domain by
strengthening coordination and cooperation with relevant
countries through information sharing, consultation, exercise,
and capacity building assistance, while promoting measures
concerning the development of international norms.

See Chapter 1, Section 2-3 (Responses in the Domains of Space,
Cyberspace and Electromagnetic Spectrum)


**1** **Cooperation in the Use of Space Domain**


Regarding the use of the space domain, Japan will promote
partnership and cooperation in various fields including the
SSA and mission assurance of the entire space system, through
consultations and information sharing with relevant countries
and active participation in multilateral exercises among others.
The MOD/SDF has taken part in the annual SSA
multinational tabletop exercise (Global Sentinel) and the
Schriever Wargame, a multinational tabletop exercise on
space security, hosted by the U.S. Forces and is working
to share the recognition of threats in space among multiple
countries and acquire knowledge related to cooperation
regarding SSA and guarantee of space system functions.

See Chapter 2, Section 2 (Strengthening Ability of Japan-U.S.


The MOD/SDF is also working on cooperation with
countries other than the United States. For example, the JapanAustralia Space Security Dialogue and Japan-U.S.-Australia
Space Security Dialogue are held to exchange opinions
on space policy. With France, based on the agreement to
strengthen bilateral dialogue on space at the Japan-France
Foreign and Defense Ministers' Meeting in March 2015, the
two countries decided to start the Japan-France Comprehensive
Space Dialogue. At the 2nd Japan-France Comprehensive
Space Dialogue in March 2017, in order to strengthen bilateral
cooperation on SSA, the two countries signed a technology
arrangement on information sharing pertaining to space
situation awareness between the competent authority of Japan
and the Minister of Defense of the Republic of France, and

agreed to promote specific cooperation initiatives. With
the EU, it was decided to start the Japan-EU Space Policy
Dialogue at the Japan-EU Summit in May 2014, and four
dialogue sessions have been held. At the Japan-India summit

**2** **Cooperation in the Use of Cyber Domain**


Regarding the use of the cyber domain, Japan will enhance
its partnership and cooperation with relevant countries
through measures such as sharing views on threat awareness,
exchanging views on response to cyber attacks, and
participating in multilateral exercises.
The MOD has held cyber dialogues with the respective

NATO, the MOD carries out initiatives looking at possible
future operational cooperation, such as establishing a cyber
dialogue between defense authorities called the Japan-NATO
Expert Staff Talks on Cyber Defense and participating in the
cyber defense exercise (Cyber Coalition) hosted by NATO
as an observer. Furthermore, Japan has participated in the
International Conference on Cyber Conflict (CyCon) and

relationships with NATO in the cyber domain through the
dispatch of personnel to the Centre since March 2019.
In addition, the IT Forum has been held between the defense
authorities of Singapore, Vietnam, and Indonesia to exchange
views on initiatives in the information communications area
including cybersecurity and current trends in technology. The
MOD has been expanding the cooperation by implementing
human resource development seminars for Vietnamese Forces
in the area of cybersecurity as part of its capacity building

**Keiko Kono, Senior Research Fellow at the National Institute for Defense Studies**

Since March 2019, I have been working as a researcher at the Law Branch of NATO Cooperative Cyber Defence Centre
of Excellence (CCDCOE) in Estonia. The centre holds a multinational cyber defense exercise named Locked Shields and
an annual international conference (CyCon) every year, and it also provides various education and training opportunities to
military officers and government officials. Furthermore, the centre conducts research on various aspects of cyber security
and publishes the outcome through its websites and other means.
This year, as a member of the headquarters, I engaged in the
legal play of Locked Shields by drafting legal questions and scoring
answers presented from 23 teams participating in the exercise. I
also research legal issues on cyber defense in the Law Branch.
How to respond to cyber attacks in terms of international
law, strategy, technology and operation has been increasingly
attracting attention also at NATO. Expectations for the centre,
which conducts research, education/training and exercises in
these fields, have been rising year by year.
I wish to learn the latest research trends at NATO and contribute to
research projects of the centre as a member of the centre, and reflect
my expertise in initiatives launched by the MOD/SDF in these fields. Author working at NATO CCDCOE (second from right)

The proliferation of weapons of mass destruction (WMDs)
and missiles that can deliver them, as well as the proliferation
of not only conventional arms but also goods and sensitive
technologies of potential military use, pose a pressing
challenge to the peace and stability of the international
community. Moreover, many countries are working on the
regulation of certain conventional weapons, considering
the need to maintain a balance between humanitarian
perspectives and defensive needs.
In order to deal with these issues, an international
framework for arms control, disarmament, and non

played an active role. Pursuant to the NDPG, Japan will
further promote the initiatives in this field in cooperation with
relevant countries and international organizations. Leveraging
SDF’s knowledge, Japan will engage in various activities
related to arms control and disarmament undertaken by the
United Nations and other bodies, including the discussion on
Lethal Autonomous Weapons Systems (LAWS).

The MOD/SDF has seconded GSDF and other personnel
to the Cabinet Office to handle this project, and since
2000, GSDF personnel with expertise in chemicals and
ammunitions have been dispatched to conduct excavation
and recovery projects on a total of 18 occasions.
In addition, the MOD has been cooperating in endeavors
aimed at increasing the effectiveness of regulations and
decisions, by dispatching MOD officials to major meetings
such as those of the Biological Weapons Convention (BWC),
as well as international export control regimes in the form of

**Lethal Autonomous Weapons Systems (LAWS)**

No international consensus on the definition of LAWS has yet been reached. International discussions on this matter have
been continuing under the framework of the Convention on Certain Conventional Weapons (CCW).
In March 2019, before the meetings of the Group of Governmental Experts (GGE) on LAWS under the framework of
CCW, Japan submitted a working paper. The submission aimed to contribute to well-balanced discussions considering
both humanity and security perspectives at GGE this year so that GGE can set a direction for possible future actions of
the international community on LAWS. The paper describes Japan’s approach to the key issues: (1) definition of LAWS;
(2) definition of lethality; (3) form of human control; (4) scope of rules; (5) relationships with international law and
ethics, and; (6) measures for confidence building. At the meeting, active discussions were made on the key issues but
gaps remained between the positions of the countries.
The MOD, as it has indicated, has no plan to develop any fully autonomous lethal weapons systems without human
involvement, nor will the ministry conduct R&D of equipment that is not permitted under international or domestic laws.
On the other hand, autonomous weapons systems do have positive security significance in terms of saving labor
and reducing human error. Moving toward a common understanding in the international community, including major
countries, MOD will continue to participate in making international rules actively and constructively, while considering
Japan’s security and clearly presenting its approach.

to international humanitarian law, and other matters. Japan
intends to continue its active involvement in the discussions,
while also considering the standpoints of national security.
Furthermore, the MOD has actively cooperated in the
initiatives of the international community that focus on the
problem of anti-personnel mines by submitting annual reports
that include data on Japan’s exceptional stocks to the UN.
In addition, the MOD/SDF participates in the meetings under
the frameworks of the UN Register of Conventional Arms, the
UN Report on Military Expenditures and Arms Trade Treaty
(ATT) with the purpose of increasing the transparency of its
military preparedness and military expenditure, and provides
the requisite reports. It also dispatches personnel as needed
to governmental expert meetings and other meetings for
reviewing and improving these systems. Since April 2018 the
MOD/SDF has been sending a Senior Fellow of the National
Institute for Defense Studies as a member of the Group of
Experts[4] of the 1540 Committee established pursuant to the UN
Security Council Resolution 1540[5] (Resolution 1540). In order
to promote implementation of the resolution, the researcher
handles reviews of reports from UN member countries,
responses to technical questions, and other activities.


Japan has signed various conventions on the regulation of
conventional weapons such as the Convention on Prohibitions
or Restrictions on the Use of Certain Conventional Weapons
Which May Be Deemed to Be Excessively Injurious or to
Have Indiscriminate Effects (CCW),[2] based on humanitarian
perspectives and security needs. In addition, Japan has signed
the Convention on Cluster Munitions (Oslo Convention),[3]
which was adopted outside the framework of the CCW.
With the entry of this Convention, the disposal of all cluster
munitions possessed by the SDF was completed in February
2015.
The Ministry dispatches personnel to Group of
Governmental Experts meetings related to LAWS and other
events as necessary under the CCW framework. International

**2** **International Initiatives Aimed at Non-Proliferation of Weapons of Mass Destruction**


Deeply concerned about the development of WMDs and
missiles by countries such as North Korea and Iran, the
United States announced its Proliferation Security Initiative
(PSI)[6] in May 2003, and sought the participation of other
countries therein. Various initiatives are being undertaken
based on PSI; PSI interdiction exercises aimed at improving
the ability to thwart the proliferation of WMDs and related
items and meetings to consider issues on policies and
legislations.
Since the 3rd PSI Meeting in Paris (September 2003), the
MOD/SDF has collaborated with relevant organizations and
countries, dispatching MOD officials and SDF personnel to
various meetings, as well as engaging in ongoing participation
in these exercises since 2004.
The MOD/SDF has participated in PSI maritime
interdiction exercises, hosted by Japan, thrice, working in
partnership with relevant organizations such as the Ministry
of Foreign Affairs, the National Police Agency, the Ministry
of Finance and the Japan Coast Guard, and also participated
in the PSI air interdiction exercise in July 2012, which Japan
hosted for the first time. Japan organized Pacific Shield 18,
a PSI maritime prevention exercise, in July 2018, to carry
out training in activities to prevent the spread of weapons
of mass destruction with Australia, New Zealand, the ROK,
Singapore, and the United States.

Based on the proliferation cases in the areas surrounding
Japan, and from the perspectives of preventing the
proliferation of WMDs and improving the response capability
of the SDF, the MOD/SDF strives to strengthen nonproliferation frameworks including PSI, as well as holding
various relevant exercises and meetings and participating in
the same kind of activities which other countries hold.

**5** **Efforts to Support International Peace Cooperation Activities**


The MOD/SDF has been proactively undertaking
international peace cooperation activities working in tandem
with diplomatic initiatives, including the use of ODA for
resolving the fundamental causes of conflicts, terrorism and
other problems.
The NDPG states that, in line with the Legislation for

**1** **Frameworks for International Peace Cooperation Activities**

1 Framework of International Peace Cooperation Activities
and Background to Stipulating Such Activities as One of
the Primary Missions of the SDF


The international peace cooperation activities undertaken
by the MOD/SDF to date are as follows: (1) international
peace cooperation assignments such as United Nations
peacekeeping operations (the so-called UN PKO); (2)
international disaster relief activities to respond to largescale natural disasters overseas; (3) activities based
on the former Special Measures Act on Humanitarian
Reconstruction Assistance in Iraq; and (4) activities based
on the former Anti-Terrorism Special Measures Act, and the
former Replenishment Support Special Measures Act. In
2007, international peace cooperation activities, which used
to be regarded as supplementary activities,[1] were upgraded
to become one of the primary missions of the SDF, alongside
the defense of Japan and the maintenance of public order.[2]
In March 2016, the Legislation for Peace and Security was
enforced, which allows cooperation and support operations
in response to situations threatening the international peace
and security that the international community is collectively
addressing based on general laws without establishing a
special measures act.


Peace and Security, Japan will actively promote international
peace cooperation activities, while giving comprehensive
consideration to such factors as purposes of missions,
situations in host countries, and political and economic
relations between Japan and host countries.

2 Continuous Initiatives to Promptly and Accurately Carry
Out International Peace Cooperation Activities


To be a proactive contributor to world peace, it is important
for the SDF to be fully prepared for any future operation. For
this reason, all three branches of the SDF, namely the GSDF,
MSDF and ASDF, designate dispatch stand-by units, and the
designated units are always ready to be deployed.
In September 2015, the UN launched the Peacekeeping
Capability Readiness System (PCRS) to enable the UN
Headquarters to grasp the registered items of each country
more specifically in order to ensure the flexibility and
readiness of international peacekeeping activities. In
light of this change, Japan registered engineering units
and staff officers of mission headquarters in March 2016.

Additionally, at the Defense Ministers Meeting on UN PKO
held in November 2017, Japan announced that it would
make arrangements for additional registration of fixed-wing
aircraft for PCRS to enable air transport assistance for rapid
PKO deployment.
Meanwhile, the SDF is enhancing information-gathering
abilities and protection abilities, which are required for the
SDF units to carry out their missions while ensuring the safety
of personnel and units in international peace cooperation
activities, etc. In addition, in order to respond to various
environments and prolonged missions, the SDF is improving
its capabilities for transport, deployment, and information
communication, as well as developing a structure of logistic
and medical support for conducting smooth and continuous
operations.
With regard to the education necessary for engaging
in international peace cooperation activities, the GSDF
International Peace Cooperation Activities Training Unit,
which belongs to the Ground Component Command,
provides training for GSDF personnel to be deployed to
international peace cooperation activities, as well as supports
their training. In addition, the Japan Peacekeeping Training
and Research Center (JPC) of the Joint Staff College offers
not only basic education courses on international peace
cooperation activities, but also specialized education to train
personnel who can be appointed as contingent commanders
of UN PKO missions and staff officers of mission
headquarters. These specialized courses are conducted by
using UN standard training materials and foreign instructors.
Furthermore, since FY2014, the JPC has also provided
education for personnel from foreign militaries and other
Japanese ministries and agencies. This initiative represents

in recent years to include such duties as the Protection of
Civilians (POC), the promotion of political processes,
providing assistance in Disarmament, Demobilization
and Reintegration (DDR) into society of former soldiers,
Security Sector Reform (SSR), the rule of law, elections,
human rights, and other fields, in addition to such traditional
missions as ceasefire monitoring. To date, there are 14 UN
PKO missions ongoing (as of the end of May 2019).
International organizations, such as the Office of the
United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR),
respective governments, and NGO conduct relief and


the approach taken by the MOD/ SDF, which emphasizes the
necessity of collaboration and cooperation with other related
ministries and foreign countries, based on the current situation
of more multi-dimensional and complicated international
peace cooperation activities. The initiative aims to contribute
to more effective international peace cooperation activities
by enhancing collaboration in the field of education.

3 Welfare and Mental Health Care of Dispatched SDF Units


SDF personnel are expected to fulfill their assigned duty
under severe working conditions while being far away
from their home country and their families. Therefore, it
is extremely important to make necessary arrangements
so that dispatched SDF personnel can effectively carry out
their assigned duty while maintaining both their physical
and mental health. For this reason, the MOD/SDF has
implemented various measures to support families to reduce
anxiety for the dispatched SDF personnel and their families.
In addition, the SDF also provides the following types
of mental health care support for personnel to be sent as
necessary according to the characteristics of the deployed
forces: (1) a pre-dispatch course to acquire necessary
knowledge on stress reduction; (2) mental health assessment
conducted several times during the pre-dispatch to postdispatch period; (3) counseling on anxiety, trouble and other
matters among the dispatched personnel provided by mental
health personnel being dispatched; (4) dispatch of mental
healthcare support teams from Japan consisting mainly of
medical officers with specialized knowledge; (5) education
before returning to Japan for reducing stress upon return; (6)
temporary health checkups after returning to Japan.

restoration activities for the victims of conflicts and largescale disasters from a humanitarian perspective and from the
viewpoint of stabilizing affected countries.
Japan has been promoting international peace cooperation
activities in various regions, including Cambodia, the Golan
Heights, Timor-Leste, Nepal, and South Sudan for more than
25 years, and the results of these activities have been highly
praised both inside and outside of Japan.
In addition to continuous dispatch of staff officers to
UNMISS, Japan is able to participate in Internationally
Coordinated Operations for Peace and Security along with
enforcement of the Legislation for Peace and Security. In
April 2019, Japan started to dispatch staff officers to the


-----

Multinational Force and Observers (MFO).
Based on the NDPG and the MTDP,[3] Japan will actively
promote international peace cooperation activities. In
particular, Japan will actively contribute through such
activities as dispatch of personnel to mission headquarters
and capacity building assistance in Japan’s field of expertise
by making good use of accumulated experience, while
working on human resource development.

contemplated by the Treaty of Peace, the President of the
Security Council announced that it would not be possible
for the United Nations to provide such peacekeeping force.
Against this backdrop, in August 1981, the parties signed the
Protocol to the Treaty of Peace through the agency of the
United States, establishing the MFO as an alternative to the
envisioned UN force.
Since 1982, when its activities started, by facilitating
dialogue and confidence building between Egypt and Israel,
the MFO has contributed to peace and stability in the Middle
East, which is a foundation of peace and prosperity for Japan.
With rising expectations of Japan’s role in the Middle East,
Japan has provided financial assistance to the MFO since
FY1988.
The MFO has expressed appreciation to Japan’s
contribution this background, the MFO requested that Japan

the first engineering rotation. In all of the PKO conducted by
Japan, the unit has made a record number of achievements.
The major achievements include a total of approximately
260 km of road repair and a total of approximately 500,000
m2 of development. Japan could move on to a new phase
regarding engineering activities in Juba that the SDF was
in charge of. Considering the above-mentioned issues in a
comprehensive manner, on March 10, 2017, the Government
of Japan came to the conclusion that the SDF engineering
unit would withdraw from Juba around the end of May 2017,
and the Minister of Defense issued an assignment termination
order for the dispatched engineering unit on March 24,
2017. SDF personnel engaged in withdrawal work, then
sequentially withdrew from South Sudan by the end of May
2017, and terminated the operations by the engineering unit
in UNMISS.
In response to a request from the UN to transfer items
possessed by the dispatched engineering unit such as heavy
machinery, vehicles, and residence-related containers, Japan
transferred these items to UNMISS with no charge, intending
to make Japan’s cooperation with UNMISS more effective.
Prior to this transfer of items, the MOD, responding to a
request from UNMISS, provided training on the operation
and maintenance of heavy machinery to UNMISS personnel,
so that UNMISS would be able to conduct engineering
activities in a smooth manner using these heavy machinery
and other equipment even after the withdrawal of the
Japanese unit.
These dedicated activities by the dispatched engineering
unit were highly appreciated and valued by the UN and
South Sudan.

**(3) Activities by Command Post Staff Officers and Others**
Personnel dispatches to the UNMISS headquarters are
continuing. Four GSDF members (logistics officer,
intelligence officer, engineering officer, and air operations
officer) currently carry out duties at the UNMISS headquarters.

**(1) Background to the Decision to Dispatch Personnel to**
**UNMISS**

The UN Mission in Sudan (UNMIS) was established following
the signing of the Comprehensive Peace Agreement (CPA)
between the Government of Sudan and the Sudan People’s
Liberation Movement/ Army in January 2005.
Beginning in October 2008, Japan dispatched two GSDF
officers to UNMIS headquarters as staff officers (logistics
and database officers), but UNMIS ended its mission in July
2011 following South Sudan’s independence. Meanwhile,
with the objective of consolidating peace and security
as well as helping establish necessary conditions for the
development of South Sudan, the UNMISS was established.
The Japanese Government was requested by the UN to
cooperate with UNMISS, particularly through the dispatch of
GSDF engineering units. The Cabinet approved the dispatch
of two staff officers (logistics and database officers) to
UNMISS in November 2011, and in December it decided to
dispatch an SDF engineering unit, Coordination Center, and
an additional staff officer (engineering officer). In addition,
the Cabinet also approved the dispatch of one staff officer
(air operations officer) in October 2014.
South Sudan shares borders with six countries and is
positioned in a highly important location, connecting the
African continent on all four points of the compass. The
peace and stability of South Sudan is not only essential
for the country itself; but also for the peace and stability
in its neighboring countries, and by extension, Africa as a
whole, as well as a crucial issue that should be dealt with
by the international community. Based on the accumulated
experience through past PKO, the MOD/SDF has contributed
to the peace and stability of South Sudan by providing
personnel-based cooperation in infrastructure development,
on which the UN places great expectations.

See Part I, Chapter 3, Section 7-3-7 (Situation in South Sudan)


**Chapter**


**(2) Activities by Dispatched Engineering Units**
In January 2012, SDF coordination centers were established
for the first time in the SDF’s participation in UN PKO,
one in the South Sudan capital city of Juba and another in
Uganda, in order to coordinate the activities conducted by the
dispatched engineering unit. Since the commencement of its
engineering activities within UN facilities in Juba in March
2012, the dispatched engineering unit has steadily expanded
its activities. The SDF has continued to dispatch over 300
personnel after the second unit took over in June of the same

4 Dispatch of Ministry of Defense Personnel to the UN
Secretariat


The MOD/SDF dispatches personnel to the United Nations
Secretariat for the purpose of actively contributing to the UN
efforts to achieve international peace and for the purpose
of utilizing experiences of dispatched personnel in Japan’s
PKO activity. As of May 2019, two Self Defense Forces
personnel (working level) are involved in the formulation of
UN PKO policies and plans at the UN Department of Peace
Operations (DPO). There is also one administrative official
(working level) working on activities related to the Triangular
Partnership Project[4] at the UN Department of Operational
Support (DOS). Since December 2002, including personnel
currently dispatched, Japan has sent six SDF members (one
director level, five working level) to the UN DPO and two
administrative officials (working level) to the UN DOS.

See Reference 52 (Dispatch of Ministry of Defense Personnel to
International Organizations)


5 Dispatch of Instructors to PKO Centers


To support PKO undertaken by African and other countries,
the MOD/SDF has dispatched SDF personnel as instructors
to PKO centers in Africa that provide education and training
for UN peacekeepers to contribute to peace and stability by
enhancing the capacity of the centers.

high quality activities, Prime Minister Abe expressed Japan s
active support at the PKO Summit in September 2014, and it
was embodied by the RDEC.
In the RDEC, the UN DOS procures heavy equipment
and carries out training for engineers using funds provided
by Japan. Japan has been dispatching SDF personnel to
the International Peace Support Training Centre (IPSTC)
in Nairobi, Kenya, as instructors since the trial training
in September 2015. It was decided to provide basic- and
middle-class training at the center twice during the period
from June to October 2018 so that many trainees can
receive training efficiently according to their level of heavy
equipment operation skill. SDF personnel were dispatched,
and they provided training regarding the operation of heavy
equipment for personnel of the Ghana national military and
others. Training has been provided in seven sessions to date
for a total of 211 members from eight African countries.


Considering that 30% or more of PKO personnel are from
Asia, Japan decided to implement the project for the first time
in Asia and the surrounding regions. The project provides
training on heavy engineering equipment operation for
engineering personnel. Trial training took place in Vietnam
from November to December 2018 for 16 personnel from
nine countries in Asia and the surrounding regions, including
Vietnam and Indonesia.

7 Revision of the UN Peacekeeping Missions Military
Engineer Unit Manual


In order to play a more leading role in international peace
cooperation activities, the MOD/SDF served as the chair of
the working group on the engineer unit manual[5] since 2013
with the aim of supporting the development of UN Military
Unit Manuals and contributed to the completion of the

**Major Kiichi Kaji, Staff of International peace cooperation activities, GSDF Engineer School (Hitachinaka City, Ibaraki)**
The UN has arranged UN Military Unit Manuals for ten fields, including aviation, communication, transport, and logistics
as references for countries participating in UN PKO. One of them, the Military Engineer Unit Manual, stipulates the
purpose of the activities, missions, abilities, training, and other standards of military engineer units participating in UN
PKO. The meeting of experts held in Tokyo in December 2018 was the first of the four meetings for revision work to be
held by Summer of 2019. In addition to the UN, ten countries, including Japan, attended the meeting.
As an assistant to the Chair, Chief Instructor of the GSDF Engineer School, who leads the revision work, I am in charge
of coordination for meetings, development of drafts of the military engineer unit manual, and other business concerning the
revision. Because the task requires coordination with experts of the UN and other countries, I felt considerably pressured
and uneasy until I meet them on the day of the meeting. However, as I interact with the frank experts, I was able to develop
a relationship with them familiar enough to call each other by our first names and smoothly proceed with the meetings.
The project is one of Japan’s intellectual contributions to the UN I feel very rewarded to be able to use the knowledge I
have acquired in GSDF for the UN. At the same time, I feel responsible for supporting military engineers around the world
who participate in UN PKO.

**3** **International Disaster Relief Activities**


In recent years, the role of military affairs has become
more diverse, and opportunities for military to use their
capabilities in humanitarian assistance and disaster relief are
growing. To contribute to the advancement of international
cooperation, the SDF has also engaged in international
disaster relief activities proactively from the viewpoint of
humanitarian contributions and improvement of the global
security environment.
To this end, the SDF maintains its readiness to take any
necessary action based on prepared disaster relief operation
plans. In consultation with the Minister of Foreign Affairs,
the SDF has been proactively conducting international
disaster relief activities, which fully utilize its functions
and capabilities, while taking into consideration specific
relief requests by the governments of affected countries and
disaster situations in these countries.


SDF decided to serve as the chair to handle the revision of
the manual. The first expert meeting was held in Tokyo in
December 2018.
The MOD/SDF will continue to work for the revision of

of relief items, patients and personnel by helicopter and other
means; and (3) water supply activities using water-purifying
devices. In addition, the SDF uses transport aircraft and
ships to carry disaster relief personnel and equipment to the
affected area.
The Ground Component Command regional units of
the GSDF and other relevant GSDF units maintain their
readiness to ensure that they can carry out international
disaster relief activities in an independent manner anytime
when needed. The Self Defense Fleet of the MSDF and Air
Support Command of the ASDF also constantly maintain
their readiness to transport personnel and their supplies to
disaster affected areas. Furthermore, in April 2015, the
MOD/SDF also improved its readiness to be able to swiftly
respond to a request for search activities using P-3C patrol
aircraft.

3 International Disaster Relief Activities in Response to
the Earthquakes and Tsunami in Indonesia


On September 28, 2018, a magnitude 7.5 earthquake struck
the area near Sulawesi Island in central Indonesia. Upon
request by the Indonesian government and based on the
results of the consultation with the Minister of Foreign
Affairs, the MOD/SDF decided to dispatch an SDF Disaster
Relief team (Local Coordination Center and an air transport
unit) on October 3.
Local Coordination Center personnel arrived at the
disaster site on October 3, followed by the air transport unit
on October 5, and the transport using a C-130H transport
aircraft started on the following day. On the 25th of the same
month the Minister of Defense ordered termination of the
mission, and the activities of the disaster relief team, which
had lasted for 23 days, ended on October 26th. The transport
unit handled transportation of about 200 tons of relief goods
(food, water, tents, clothes, etc.) in total and about 400
displaced and other people between Balikpapan (Kalimantan
island), Jakarta (Java island), and Palu (Sulawesi island),
which was the disaster area.


1 Outline of the Japan Disaster Relief Team Law


Since the enactment of the Law Concerning the Dispatch of
the Japan Disaster Relief Team (Japan Disaster Relief Team
Law) in 1987, Japan has engaged in international disaster
relief activities in response to requests from the governments
of affected countries and international organizations. In 1992,
the Japan Disaster Relief Team Law was partially amended,
enabling the SDF to participate in international disaster relief
activities and to transport its personnel and equipment for
this purpose.

The National Defense Program Guidelines for FY2019 and
beyond (NDPG)[1] specifi es that the core element of defense
capability is Self-Defense Forces (SDF) personnel, and that
securing human resources for SDF personnel and improving
their ability and morale are essential to strengthening defense
capability. This has become an imminent challenge in the face

**1** **Recruitment and Employment**

1 Recruitment


It is vital to secure highly qualifi ed personnel for the Ministry
of Defense (MOD)/SDF to carry out various missions
appropriately. Expectations from the public for the MOD/SDF
have continued to rise. In Japan, however, due to the recent
economic and employment upturn, as well as the advancement
of declining birthrate and popularization of higher education,
the environment surrounding the recruitment of uniformed
SDF personnel is severe. In such a situation, it is necessary
for the MOD/SDF to recruit excellent human resources with
a strong desire to enlist, by explaining suffi ciently to them the
missions, roles, duties, and working conditions of the SDF.
For this reason, the MOD/SDF holds recruiting meetings
at schools and also maintains Provincial Cooperation Offi ces
in 50 locations throughout Japan to respond to the individual
needs of applicants, with the understanding of educators
and support from recruitment counselors. Moreover, local
governments will carry out some of the administrative
activities regarding the recruitment of uniformed SDF
personnel and candidates for uniformed SDF personnel,
including announcing the recruitment period and promoting
the SDF as a workplace, with the MOD bearing the
requisite cost. At the same time, the MOD will strengthen
coordination with local governments to ensure successful
necessary collaboration including information provision on
the recruitment target, which is indispensable for ensuring
smooth administrative activities regarding the recruitment.


of shrinking and aging population with declining birth rates.
Also in light of the sustainability and resilience of defense
capability, the SDF needs to work even further to reinforce
the human resource base that sustains the defense capability.
SDF’s measures to reinforce the human resource base
including those taken so far are explained below.

2 Employment


**(1) Uniformed SDF Personnel**

Based on a voluntary system that respects individuals’ free will,
uniformed SDF personnel are recruited under various categories.
The upper age limit of general candidate for enlistment (Upper)
and candidates for uniformed SDF personnel was raised from
“under 27” to ”under 33” in October 2018 in order to secure
diverse human resources from a broader range, including people
with work experience in private companies.

Due to the uniqueness of their duties, personnel management
of uniformed SDF personnel differs from that of general civilian
government employees,[2] including “Early Retirement System”
and “Fixed Term System” to maintain the SDF’s strength.
After employment, uniformed SDF personnel are assigned
their branch of service and duties at units all around Japan,
in accordance with their choice or aptitude, following basic
education and training at respective training units or schools of
respective SDF services.

3 As for the SDF candidates, in order to enhance the initial education of SDF personnel in short-term service, in July 2010, it was decided that their status for the first three months of their enlistment would be as non-SDF personnel, and they would engage exclusively in
fundamental education and practice as non-regular Ministry of Defense personnel.

4 GSDF High Technical School trains people to be SDF personnel who will be capable not only of operating and making full use of equipment in the GSDF but also of conducting missions in the international community. For SDF students, starting from FY2010
appointments, their status was changed from SDF officer to “students,” which is a new non-regular status. New students receive a high school diploma at the conclusion of a student course (three years) through distance learning. From the FY2011 appointments, a
new recommendation system was introduced in which those who are considered appropriate to be a GSDF High Technical School student are selected from among the candidates based on the recommendation of the principal of their junior high school etc., in addition
to the conventional general examination.

**(2) SDF Reserve Personnel, SDF Ready Reserve Personnel,**
**and Candidates for SDF Reserve Personnel**

It is essential to secure the required number of uniformed
SDF personnel promptly depending on situational changes in
the event of a crisis. To secure the required number promptly
and systematically, the MOD maintains the following three
systems: the SDF Reserve Personnel system, the SDF Ready
Reserve Personnel system, and the Candidates for SDF
Reserve Personnel system.[3]

See Fig. IV-1-1-3 (Overview of Systems Related to SDF Reserve

See

Personnel)

SDF Reserve Personnel become uniformed SDF personnel
upon the issuance of a defense call-up order or other orders, and
carry out logistical support and base guard duties. SDF Ready
Reserve Personnel become uniformed SDF personnel and are
assigned to carry out their mission together with incumbent
uniformed SDF personnel as part of frontline units following
the issuance of a defense call-up order or other orders.
Candidates for SDF Reserve Personnel, some of whom are
recruited among those with no prior experience as uniformed
SDF personnel, are appointed as SDF Reserve Personnel after
completing the necessary education and training.
As SDF Reserve Personnel and others work in their
civilian jobs under normal circumstances, they need to
adjust their work schedule to participate in periodic training
exercises. Therefore, understanding and cooperation from
the companies that employ these personnel are essential.
For this purpose, the MOD provides a special subsidy to

**Fig. IV-1-1-3** Overview of Systems Related to SDF Reserve Personnel


**Chapter**


Graduation ceremony at the National Defense Academy (March 2019)

the companies that employ SDF Ready Reserve Personnel
and take necessary measures to allow such employees to
attend training sessions for 30 days a year, by taking into
consideration the burden on such companies. Also, in 2017,
the MOD established a framework that allows the MOD/SDF
to provide such information as the scheduled term of a training
call-up and scheduled term during which SDF Reserve
Personnel/SDF Ready Reserve Personnel are called up to
perform actual operations and are appointed as uniformed SDF
personnel, when requested by their employers. In 2018, the
MOD established a system to provide a subsidy which aims
to contribute to securing understanding and cooperation from
the employers regarding the duties of SDF Reserve Personnel.
Under the system, the employers are provided with a subsidy if
(1) SDF Reserve Personnel or SDF Ready Reserve Personnel
respond to a defense operation call-up order, civil protection
dispatch call-up order, or disaster relief call-up order, etc. or if

**Outstanding Performance by a SDF Ready Reserve Personnel and a Business Owner**
**Who Works with SDF Ready Reserve Personnel as His Employees**

**Ready Reserve Sergeant First Class Teruaki Shiina, 1st Infantry Company,**
**52nd Infantry Regiment (Makomanai, Sapporo)**
I participated in a disaster relief mission as a SDF Ready Reserve Personnel
in the aftermath of the September 2018 Hokkaido Eastern Iburi Earthquake.
Immediately after the earthquake, I learned about the severity of damage
in the affected areas, hinting that I would be called up for a disaster relief
operation. I consequently asked my superior at work for permission to
participate in a potential disaster relief assignment beforehand, with a desire
to utilize the experience I gained in participating in a two-week disaster
relief duty in response to the Great East Japan Earthquake. The permission
was granted.
I initially worried about my family suffering from an ongoing power
outage. However, my family supported and encouraged me to join the
disaster relief mission as a SDF Ready Reserve Personnel.
In the afflicted areas, I transported relief goods, supplied drinking water Shiina (front right) supplying drinking water in Atsuma Town
and engaged in other activities. Although I am not sure how much assistance
I was able to provide to disaster victims, they certainly cheered me up by showing their high spirits.
I sincerely hope that a disaster of this magnitude will never happen again. However, I will fully prepare for the next time I am called
up for a disaster relief mission, whenever it might be, by working hard in training sessions, which amount to a total of 30 days annually.

Although the damage caused in Obihiro by the September 2018 Hokkaido Eastern Iburi Earthquake was relatively minor, I had to shut
down the operation of my company there for several days due to a power outage, forcing us to deal with a lot of troubles. During the
shutdown, the GSDF called up my employees for a disaster relief mission. As a business owner, I was anxious as to how to run a business
with my employees away for the mission. At the same time, I was proud of the
fact that my employees were selected for the mission as I am also an active SDF
Reserve Personnel interested in joining disaster relief operations in affected
areas.
My company currently employs three SDF Ready Reserve Personnel, and
I agreed to send two of them this time. When I sent them off, I offered them
encouragement, with the hope that they would earnestly carry out their assigned
duty so that the livelihoods of affected people could be restored as quickly as
possible.
When my employees returned from the disaster relief mission, they looked
very satisfied. I believe that they gained valuable experience that will lead to
personal growth as members of society and as people in general. Recent photo of Fukuzawa in his workplace

SDF Ready Reserve Personnel were called up at the time of
the 2016 Kumamoto Earthquake[4], the 2018 July Heavy Rain,[5]
and the 2018 Hokkaido Eastern Iburi Earthquake.[6] They
carried out their missions, including transportation of goods
and water supply. The MOD has been implementing various
measures to increase and enhance SDF Reserve Personnel
and others because SDF Reserve Personnel are anticipated to
be called up more often in response to earthquake and other
disasters. Specifically, recruitment and appointment were


expanded in 2018 to secure a wide variety of human resources
from a broader range. The upper age limit for recruitment
of leading privates and lower SDF Reserve Personnel was
raised from “under 37” to “under 55” and the upper age limit
for their continued appointment from “under 61” to “under
62.” An upper age limit is not set for persons with a license
for a medical practitioner. Their continued appointment is
approved when it is confirmed that they properly maintain
their medical techniques and that there is no problem with
their duties as SDF Reserve Personnel. The upper age limit for
recruitment of leading privates and lower SDF Ready Reserve


In response to the Kumamoto Earthquake in 2016, a call-up order for SDF Ready Reserve Personnel was issued for the second time in the SDF’s history, and 162 Ready Reserve Personnel
engaged in activities such as livelihood support to the affected people.

In response to the heavy rain in July 2018, SDF Ready Reserve Personnel were called up for the 3rd time in its history. From July 12 to 30, 311 SDF Ready Reserve Personnel engaged in
life support and other activities.

At the time of the 2018 Hokkaido Eastern Iburi Earthquake, SDF Ready Reserve Personnel were called up for the 4th time in its history. From September 8 to 23, 251 SDF Ready Reserve

Personnel without experience as SDF personnel as SDF Ready
Reserve Personnel after certain education and training.
Also, the MOD promotes the use of SDF Reserve Personnel
in a wide range of fields, such as the appointment of retired
SDF pilots, who are to be reemployed in the private sector, to
SDF Reserve Personnel through the re-employment system.[7]

**(3) Administrative Officials, Technical and Engineering**
**Officials, Instructors, and Other Civilian Personnel**

There are approximately 21,000 civilian personnel —
administrative officials, technical and engineering officials,
instructors, and others[8] — in addition to uniformed SDF
personnel in the MOD/SDF. Civilian personnel are mainly
recruited from those who have passed the Recruitment
Examination for Comprehensive and General Service National
Public Employees conducted by the National Personnel
Authority (NPA), and those who have passed the Recruitment
Examination for Ministry of Defense Specialists conducted by
the MOD. After participating in the common training course,


civilian personnel recruited in this process work in a wide range
of fields.
Administrative officials are engaged in defense-related
policy planning in the Internal Bureaus of the MOD and at the
Acquisition, Technology and Logistics Agency (ATLA); analysis
and evaluation at the Defense Intelligence Headquarters; and
administrative works at the SDF bases, the Regional Defense
Bureaus, and other locations throughout the country.
Technical and engineering officials are working in the
Internal Bureaus of the MOD, the ATLA, the SDF bases, the
Regional Defense Bureaus, and other locations throughout
the country. They are engaged in constructing various defense
facilities (headquarters, runways, magazines, etc.), carrying
out research and development (R&D), efficient procurement,
maintenance and improvement of a range of equipment, as well
as providing mental health care for SDF personnel.
Instructors conduct advanced research on defense and
provide high-quality education to SDF personnel at the National
Institute for Defense Studies, the National Defense Academy,
the National Defense Medical College, and other organizations.

**Chapter**


1 Education of Uniformed SDF Personnel


Enhancing the ability of the individual uniformed SDF
personnel who comprise SDF units is essential for the
execution of the units’ duties. For this purpose, the respective
SDF training units and schools provide opportunities for
phased and systematic education according to rank and duties
to nurture necessary qualities and instill knowledge and skills.
A considerable extent of human, temporal, and economic
efforts such as securing instructors with special skills, and
improving equipment and educational facilities, are necessary
for providing education. In the event that personnel need to
further improve their professional knowledge and skills, or
that it is difficult for them to acquire such knowledge and
skills within the SDF, the MOD/SDF commissions education
to external institutions, including those abroad, as well as
domestic companies and research institutes. Furthermore,
based on the Medium Term Defense Program (FY2019FY2023; MTDP),[9] in order to promote cross-domain joint
operations, the MOD/SDF will strengthen joint education and


2 SDF Training


**(1) Training and Exercise by Each SDF**

Training and exercise conducted by units in each service can
be broadly divided into training for individual SDF personnel
to improve the necessary proficiency for their respective
fields, and training and exercise for units to enhance their
systematic capabilities. Training for individuals is conducted
one-on-one in stages based on occupational classification
and individual ability. Training and exercise for units is
conducted depending on the size of unit, from small to large;
meanwhile, large-scale comprehensive training including
coordination between units is also conducted.
In order to effectively respond to various contingencies
and enhance its deterrence effectiveness, based on the MTDP,


The re-employment system for SDF pilots aims to prevent the outflow of active young SDF pilots to civil aviation companies in an unregulated manner. This system is also designed to
utilize SDF pilots over a certain age as pilots of commercial airlines, and is also significant from the perspective of the development of the airline industry in Japan as a whole.

3 Initiatives to Safety Management, etc.


The MOD/SDF constantly strive as one for safety
management, such as by implementing the highest level of
safety measures and precautions during routine training.
Despite these efforts, two F-2 fighters of Air Self-Defense
Force (ASDF) Tsuiki Air Base (Fukuoka Prefecture) came
into contact midair in the training air space at sea to the west
of the base in November 2018. In the same month, a vehicle
of ASDF Misawa Air Base (Aomori Prefecture) crashed into
a house in Kamikita District, Aomori Prefecture. A shell hit a
surrounding area and damaged a private vehicle when a unit
belonging to Camp Shinodayama (Osaka Prefecture) was
conducting firing training using 81mm mortar in the GSDF
Aibano Training Area. Furthermore, in February 2019 an F-2
fighter of ASDF Tsuiki Air Base crashed in the Sea of Japan
off Yamaguchi Prefecture. The MOD/SDF is fully enforcing
recurrence prevention measures and expending all possible
means to ensure safety. Also, in April 2019, an F-35A fighter
of ASDF Misawa Air Base crashed in the Pacific Ocean to
the east of Aomori Prefecture, losing one SDF personnel on
duty. Regarding the cause of the accident, the MOD/SDF has
come to the judgement that it is extremely unlikely that the
pilot lost consciousness or the aircraft had a problem, and that
the pilot was likely to have fallen into spatial disorientation
(condition in which the pilot has lost sense of balance).
Therefore, the MOD/SDF has taken thorough measures
to prevent recurrence of the accident including providing
education/training to the pilots and special inspection of
F-35A aircraft just in case.
Any accident that can cause injury to the public, damage to its
property, or the loss of life of SDF personnel, must be avoided
at all costs. The MOD/SDF as a whole is making its utmost
effort to prevent recurrence of such accidents by thoroughly
investigating their causes and making sure each member has
recognized the importance of safety management once again.


SDF s joint training and exercises and Japan-U.S. bilateral
training and exercises are to be conducted in a tailored and
visible way. While leveraging the lessons learned from these
training and exercises, the SDF will conduct regular studies and
reviews of its plans to address contingencies.[10 ]The SDF will
also strive to further enhance amphibious operation capability
by the implementation of training by the Ground Self-Defense
Force (GSDF) and Maritime Self-Defense Force (MSDF) in
collaboration with U.S. Marines, the SDF will strive to enhance
the effectiveness of the swift and continuous deployment of
units and strengthen their presence on a steady-state basis by
organically coordinating such training and exercises that utilize
training environments in Japan and abroad.
Also, seeking to respond to various situations with a
whole-of-government approach, coordination with relevant
agencies including police, firefighters, and the Japan Coast
Guard will be reinforced. The SDF will also actively utilize
the opportunities presented by the joint training and exercises
of the SDF and Japan-U.S. bilateral training and exercises as
a way not only for considering and verifying plans for the
actual SDF operations, but also for actively considering and
verifying comprehensive issues including civil protection.

See Reference 58 (Major Exercises Conducted in FY2018)

See


**(2) Training Environment**

SDF training has been planned and conducted under
conditions that are as close as possible to actual combat
situations, yet many restrictions remain. Therefore, the SDF
will conduct effective training and exercises by expanding
the establishment and utilization of the training areas in
Hokkaido and elsewhere in Japan based on the NDPG and
other guidelines. Furthermore, the SDF will also facilitate
expanded joint/shared use of U.S. Forces facilities and
areas with the SDF while accounting for relations with local
communities. Furthermore, the SDF will facilitate the use of
places other than SDF facilities or U.S. Forces facilities and
areas, and the utilization of excellent training environments
overseas, such as the U.S. and Australia, and introduce
simulators actively.

**3** **Measures Aimed at Ensuring Effective Use of Human Resources**


3 Dealing with Retirement and Re-employment of SDF
Personnel


1 Effective Use of Human Resources


In order to maintain the strength of the SDF, many uniformed
SDF personnel retire in their mid-50s (personnel serving
under the early retirement system) or in their 20s (most
uniformed SDF personnel serving under the fixed-term
service system). Therefore, many of them need to find another
job after retirement in order to secure their livelihoods.
Since supporting re-employment is the responsibility of the
Japanese Government (the MOD) as the employer, and is crucial
both for resolving any concerns that uniformed SDF personnel
may have about their future as well as for securing qualified
human resources, the MOD conducts support measures such as
occupational training useful for their re-employment.
In addition, as the MOD does not have the authority to
provide them with employment placement, the Foundation
for the SDF Personnel Support Association provides free job
consultation services for retired SDF personnel with permission
from the Minister of Health, Labor and Welfare and the Minister
of Land, Infrastructure, Transport and Tourism.
Retired uniformed SDF personnel have excellent abilities in
planning, leadership, faculty, cooperativeness, and responsibility
gained through their work performance, education and training.
Furthermore, they have various qualifications and licenses
acquired through their duties and vocational training. Therefore,
they are making positive contributions in a broad range of
sectors, including manufacturing and service industries, as well
as finance, insurance, real estate, and construction industries, in
addition to the areas of disaster prevention and risk management
at local governments.
Based on the NDPG and MTDP, the MOD/SDF will strive
to further improve re-employment support by such means as
further utilization of retired SDF personnel while strengthening
collaboration with local governments and related organizations
from the perspective of utilizing the knowledge, skills, and
experience of retired SDF personnel in addition to expanding
vocational training subjects and support for step-by-step
acquisition of qualifications before their retirement. Specifically,
as of the end of March 2019, a total of 495 retired SDF personnel
work as crisis management officers at local governments’
disaster prevention bureaus—46 prefectural bureaus have 89
of them in total, and 348 municipal bureaus have 406. As this
strengthens collaboration with local governments and enhances
the ability to deal with crisis management, including disaster
prevention, the MOD/SDF will continue active support for
the utilization of retired SDF personnel in local governments’
disaster prevention bureaus by further enhancing these efforts.

See Reference 60 (Main Measures for Re-employment Support)

Reference 61 (Employment Situation of Retired Uniformed
SDF Personnel in Disaster Prevention-related Bureaus in
Local Government)


With regard to the personnel structure of the SDF, the fixed
number of SDF personnel has been constantly reduced. On
the other hand, there has been the need for further skilled
and professional personnel in order to respond to the
advancement of equipment as well as the diversification and
internationalization of SDF missions.
In light of such circumstances, while ensuring the
robustness of the SDF, the NDPG and others plan to raise
the mandatory early retirement age by one year during the
period of the MTDP from 2020, and another one year during
the period of the next MTDP in stages for each rank in order
to ensure further utilization of older human resources who
have rich knowledge, skills, and experience. The SDF also
continues to expand reenrollment after retirement (up to
the age of 65) and further promotes utilization of the skills
of retired SDF personnel in fields requiring high levels of
expertise. In addition, the SDF will promote manpower
saving and automation by leveraging technological
innovations such as artificial intelligence.

**Chapter**


See


2 Improvement of Living and Work Environment and
Treatment


To enable all SDF personnel to maintain high morale and
continue to fully exercise their ability, the NDPG and the
MTDP state that the MOD/SDF will improve living and
work environment. Specifically, the SDF will steadily renew
aged everyday life/workplace fixtures, secure the necessary
quantities of everyday necessities in addition to accelerating
the securing and reconstruction of the necessary barracks
and housing, and proceed with measures against aging and
earthquake resistance for facilities.
Because SDF personnel carry out their missions under a
severe environment, the SDF will improve their treatment
based on the special nature of their missions and work
environment. Specifically, in order to ensure appropriate
treatment in accordance with the risk and special nature
of their missions and the characteristics of the area of the
office, the SDF will make improvements, including special
work allowance. To enable SDF personnel to fulfill their
missions with high morale and pride, the MOD/SDF will
improve their treatment through measures concerning
honors and privileges, including the enhancement of the
defensive meritorious badges to better acknowledge their
achievements.
Although these measures have already been taken, the
SDF will continue to work on various measures in line with
the NDPG and the MTDP.

4 Initiatives to Support Families


In addition to exchanges between units and personnel’s
families, as well as between the families, the MOD in
cooperation with relevant external groups and organizations
is also actively working to develop a family support system
to be implemented in the event of large-scale natural disasters
and other events, which will include receiving cooperation
in confirming the safety of the family members of SDF
personnel. All of these are conducted as routine initiatives.
Furthermore, specific welfare services for SDF personnel
deployed overseas include facilitating direct communication
with their families in Japan by means such as e-mail and
video conference systems. Support for sending comfort
items from their families at a later date is also provided.
Moreover, briefing sessions for families of the dispatched
SDF personnel are held to provide them with a variety of
information, and a consultation desk exclusively for families
of the dispatched SDF personnel (family support centers), a
website for the families of the dispatched SDF personnel and
similar facilities have been established to provide consolation
for the various questions and concerns raised by the families.

5 Initiatives to Maintain Strong Discipline


The MOD/SDF has gained great expectations from the
public and in order for the SDF to perform its maximum
ability on duty, it is essential to achieve support and trust
from the public. To this end, the SDF is required to always
maintain strong discipline.
The MOD/SDF has so far strived to foster well-disciplined
personnel by impressing in them an awareness of compliance
with the law through setting up such campaign periods as
the “MOD Anti-Drug Abuse Month,” “Self-Defense Forces
Personnel Ethics Week,” and “Self-Defense Personnel
Harassment Prevention Week” and implemented various
measures such as thorough instructions on service discipline.

Notes 1: The mandatory age of retirement for SDF personnel who hold the rank of General (GSDF and ASDF) or Admiral (MSDF), and serve as
Chief of Staff of Joint Staff Office, GSDF Chief of Staff, MSDF Chief of Staff, or ASDF Chief of Staff, is 62.

2: The mandatory age of retirement for SDF personnel who hold positions such as physician, dentist, pharmacist, musician, military police
officer, or information analyst, is 60.

Meanwhile, with regard to the re-employment of
SDF personnel, new regulations about re-employment
were introduced in October 2015, replacing the former
prior approval system. As are the cases in other national
government employees, the following three regulations
were put in place in order to ensure the trust of the public
regarding the fairness of official duties: (1) regulation on
requesting re-employment of other personnel and retired
personnel and requesting information; (2) regulation on
seeking employment opportunities at companies in which
retired personnel had a stake whilst in office; and (3)
regulation on re-employed personnel making requests.[11] In
order to ensure strict observation of these regulations, bodies
comprised of academic experts with no history serving
as SDF members (Defense Personnel Review Board’s
Separate Meeting for Monitoring Reemployment and
Cabinet Office’s Re-employment Surveillance Commission)
monitor the situation, and any violation will be met with
penalties. Additionally, for the purpose of appropriate
implementation of unified management and disclosure of
re-employment information by institutionalizing notification
and announcement of such information by the Cabinet, it has
been decided that information on the re-employment status
of retired SDF personnel who were in managerial positions
(equivalent to the position of Senior Coordinator in the MOD
or higher) is to be published every fiscal year by the Cabinet.
In response to the introduction of this system in FY2015,
notifications of re-employment of the retired SDF personnel
who were in managerial positions submitted during FY2017

6 Initiatives to Prevent Suicide among SDF Personnel


SDF personnel suicides reached a record 101 in FY2005,
and have subsequently increased and decreased, with 62
suicides in FY2018. The suicide of SDF members is truly
a great tragedy for both the individuals themselves and
their bereaved families. It also represents a great loss to
the MOD/SDF in terms of the loss of capable personnel,
and the MOD/SDF is taking ongoing measures to prevent
suicides, including the following initiatives: (1) Expansion
and enhancement of the counseling system (internal/
external counselors, a 24-hour telephone counseling hotline,
assignment of clinical psychotherapists at camps and bases,
etc.); (2) Strengthening of education to raise awareness about
mental health for commanders as well as enlisted personnel;
and (3) Establishment of a campaign period for enhancing
mental health care, close monitoring by commanders of the
mental health condition of their subordinates whose working
environment has been changed due to personnel transfers,
etc., and distribution of various reference materials. In 2019
the MOD/SDF has been promoting measures using external
means, including proposals by outside experts, in order to
further improve the effectiveness of suicide prevention
measures.


of protecting the peace and independence of Japan. They
have been devoting themselves unstintingly to training, day
and night, to live up to the expectations and trust of Japanese
citizens, regardless of danger, and with a strong sense of
responsibility. During this time period, however, more than
1,900 personnel have lost their lives in the line of duty.
In the MOD/SDF, funeral ceremonies in order to
express condolences are carried out by each unit to which
the personnel who perished in the line of duty belonged.
Moreover, in order to eternally recognize the achievements
of the SDF personnel who perished in the line of duty, and to
express deep honor and condolences, memorial ceremonies
are carried out in various forms, such as the Memorial
Service for members of the SDF personnel who lost their
lives in the line of duty conducted with the participation of
the Prime Minister.[12]


7 Commemorating Personnel who Perished in the
Line of Duty


Since the establishment of the National Police Reserve
in 1950 and through its evolution via the National Safety
Force and the Coastal Safety Force into the SDF today, SDF
personnel have been striving to accomplish the noble mission

12 The Monument for SDF Personnel who Perished in the Line of Duty was constructed in 1962 in Ichigaya. In 1998, the Memorial Zone in its current form was completed by combining this
monument with other monuments located in the same area. The MOD holds an annual memorial ceremony for SDF personnel who perished in the line of duty with the attendance of
surviving family members, the Prime Minister, high-ranking officials of the MOD/SDF including the Minister of Defense, former Defense Ministers, and others. At the Monument for SDF
Personnel who Perished in the Line of Duty in the Memorial Zone, there is an iron plate containing the names and other information of personnel who perished in the line of duty. When
foreign dignitaries such as Defense Ministers visit the MOD, they make offerings of flowers, expressing their respect and condolences to personnel who perished in the line of duty.

**2** **Further Promotion of Work-Life Balance and Women’s Participation Capability**


The security environment surrounding Japan has become
increasingly severe, and both the number and the duration of
situations requiring the MOD/SDF’s response are increasing.
On the other hand, it is anticipated that a number of MOD
staff, both male and female, will face time and commuting
constraints for childcare, nursing care and other reasons due
to big changes in social structure.
Amid such challenging circumstances, ensuring
preparedness to consistently respond to various situations
requires creating an environment that enables staff to be
sound both mentally and physically, maintain high morale,
and fully demonstrate their abilities. On the basis of this
view, the MOD/SDF promotes initiatives to achieve worklife balance of its staff members.
Also, the MOD/SDF has been proactively encouraging

**1** **Working Style Reform**


**(1) Value and Mentality Reform**

In order to implement working style reform, focus needs to
be placed especially on reforming the values and mentality
of staff in managerial positions regarding working style.
Since FY2017, the MOD/SDF has been implementing
educational initiatives, such as message given by the MOD/
SDF leaders, seminars, and lecture meetings aimed at raising
awareness concerning working style reform and the concept
of work-life balance. With the increase of personnel facing
time/commuting constraints for child/family care, the MOD/
SDF is also promoting correction of long working hours and
encouraging taking leave to ensure proper work-life balance
so that every member can exert his/her full potential.


the active participation of female personnel, and the number
of female personnel is on the rise.
The MOD/SDF has been conducting a variety of
initiatives in order to promote work-life balance and the
further expansion of the recruitment and promotion of female
personnel in a unified manner, such as formulating various
plans[1] that include three reforms: (1) working style reform;
(2) reform to combine a successful career with childrearing
and nursing care; and (3) reform for promoting active
engagement of female personne. In addition, the Committee
to Promote Working style Reform of the Internal Bureau staff
was set up under the leadership of the Parliamentary ViceMinister of Defense in January 2019. Working style reform
and promoting active participation of female personnel are
also set in the NDPG and the MTDP.

and the State Minister of Defense honored particularly
excellent initiatives, out of the applications received from
various organizations and others, and used them to help
achieve work reform at each workplace.


**Chapter**


**(3) Flexible Working Hours and Location**

Realizing more flexible working hours and work locations
is necessary in light of factors such as workload fluctuations
and time constraints faced by individuals. For this reason,
the MOD/SDF introduced the flextime system in 2016
and enabled its staff to choose Flexible Working Hours by
dividing early/late shifts into multiple stages. In addition,
telework, a work style that allows working at home, has
been available in the Internal Bureau of the MOD since
FY2017 and in the ATLA since 2018. Other organizations
aim to begin adopting this work system from FY2019 and are
steadily making preparation by piloting the system.


**(2) Work Reform in the Workplace**

It is important that initiatives for the promotion of worklife balance are implemented in a way which fits the
individual workplaces, and that staff members themselves
consider specific measures for improving their workplace
environment. This approach will lead to developing effective
initiatives and workplace climate. Based on this perspective,
since 2016, the annual “Competition for initiatives to promote
Working Style Reform at the Ministry of Defense” has been
held during the campaign period for enhancing work-life
balance from June to September. The Minister of Defense


(1) “Action Plan for Promoting the Active Participation of Female Employees and Work-Life Balance at the MOD” (January 2015), (2) “Action Plan of the MOD Based on the Law to Promote
the Role of Women in the Workforce (FY2016-FY2020)” (April 2016), and (3) “Action Plan to Support a Good Work-Life Balance of the Personnel of the MOD based on the Act on
Ad t f M t S t R i i N t G ti Child (FY2015 FY2020)” (M h 2015)


-----

**2** **Reform to Combine a Successful Career with Childrearing and Nursing Care**


In order for MOD/SDF staff, both male and female, to be
successful in their careers while realizing work-life balance,
it is necessary to establish a system that enables balancing
work with childrearing/nursing care, and to ensure childcare
services tailored to the irregular working patterns unique to
the SDF.

**(1) Development of an Environment that Enables Staff to**
**Realize a Successful Career While Engaging in Childrearing**
**and Nursing Care**

The MOD/SDF has developed various schemes, which
enable staff to balance work with childrearing/nursing care,
such as ensuring substitute personnel for staff who take
childcare leave and other leave. In particular, the ministry is
encouraging its male staff to take childcare leave to promote
their participation in family settings. The target rate of
childcare leave acquisition by male staff is set at 13% by
2020.
The MOD/SDF is also developing an environment that
enables staff to balance work life with their family life by
distributing e-mail newsletters to help its staff to return to
work smoothly after childcare leave and encouraging staff to
use a “childcare form” to facilitate managers’ and the human
resources department’s thorough and detailed understanding
of the situation regarding childcare.
The MOD/SDF has a system to rehire SDF personnel
who have previously resigned mid-career. It reassessed the
system so that former SDF personnel who had resigned in
their mid-career due to childrearing and nursing care could
be reemployed from January 2017. The MOD/SDF started
recruitment based on this system in January 2018.

concentrate on their duties, it is important to ensure childcare
services tailored to the irregular working patterns unique
to the SDF. Since April 2007, the MOD/SDF has set up
workplace nurseries at GSDF Camp Mishuku, GSDF Camp
Kumamoto, GSDF Camp Makomanai, GSDF Asaka Camp
housing district, MSDF Yokosuka Naval Base district, ASDF
Iruma Air Base, Ichigaya district, where the MOD is located,
and National Defense Medical College.
In addition, in the event of emergency operations such
as disaster relief, the MOD promotes measures to provide
temporary childcare in SDF camps and bases for children
of SDF personnel who have no alternative but to attend to
duties with their children.


**3** **Reform for Promoting the Careers of Female Personnel**


**(1) Significance of Promoting Active Engagement of Female**
**SDF Personnel and Personnel Management Policy**

The “Initiative” outlines the significance of promoting the
active engagement of female personnel and the MOD/SDF
personnel management policy. Specifically, with SDF duties
becoming increasingly diverse and complex, SDF personnel
are required, more than ever, to have multifaceted capabilities
including higher levels of knowledge, decision-making
ability, and skills. In addition, under a severe recruitment
environment due to the declining birthrate and greater
advancement into higher education, it is anticipated that the
number of SDF personnel with time and location restraints,
including those involved in childcare nursing care and other


For the further expansion of the recruitment and promotion
of female personnel, the MOD/SDF has been making various
efforts to advance the careers of motivated and qualified
female personnel by setting up specific goals with regard to
the recruitment and promotion of female personnel under the
“Action Plan for Promoting the Active Participation of Female
Employees and Work-Life Balance.” Moreover, the MOD
formulated the “Initiative to Promote Active Engagement
of Female SDF Personnel – Aiming for Attractive SDF that
Adapts to the Times and Environment” (the “Initiative”) in
April 2017 to specify its conceptual policy for promoting the
active participation of female SDF personnel.

responsibilities, will significantly increase.
In light of these changes, the SDF is required to evolve
from a conventional organization with an emphasis on
homogeneity among the members, into an organization that
is capable of incorporating diverse human resources in a
flexible manner.
At present, the largest human resource that the SDF has
not been able to fully utilize is women, who account for
half of the population targeted for recruitment. Promoting
the active engagement of female SDF personnel has the
following significance: (1) securing useful human resources;
(2) utilizing diverse perspectives; and (3) reflecting values
of the nation. For this reason, the MOD/SDF has decided to
open up a path for female personnel with motivation, ability,
and aptitude to have opportunities to demonstrate their
abilities in various fields, and aim for doubling the ratio of
female SDF personnel.
In terms of employing and promoting female SDF


personnel, the MOD/SDF sets out a personnel management
policy to ensure equal opportunity between men and women
and assign the right person to the right place based on the
person’s motivation and ability/aptitude.

**(2) Removal of the Assignment Restriction of Female SDF**
**Personnel**

The MOD/SDF has been reviewing the restriction of
assignment of female personnel. With the removal of the
restriction on female assignments in submarines in 2018,
assignment restriction against females was completely
removed with the exception of the units where female
personnel cannot be assigned for reasons of maternity
protection (a part of the GSDF Nuclear Biological Chemical
(NBC) Weapon Defense Unit [chemical] and Tunnel
Company Units).

**Success of Female Personnel – the First Female Fighter Pilot of ASDF**

**First Lieutenant Misa Matsushima, 305th Squadron, Flight Group, 5th Air Wing Headquarters**
**(Shintomi Town, Koyu County, Miyazaki Prefecture)**

Since the latter half of the 1980s, female fighter pilots have been appearing one after another and flourishing in advanced
countries. ASDF also opened the door to female fighter pilots in 2015. Thanks to favorable trends around the world like
this, I was able to become a fighter pilot in August 2018 after completing various types of training.
I obtained my long-desired chance to become a fighter pilot. I feel strongly that I owe this to pioneering female pilots
who have been vigorously pursuing their flight tasks in the GSDF, MSDF and ASDF, and other female SDF personnel who
are active in a broad working range overcoming various troubles and difficulties.
I am now assigned to the 305th Squadron line troop and engage in missions against violation of our territorial air in
times of peace while working on exercises everyday so that I can carry out operations during armed contingencies. When
scrambling in response to unidentified aircraft, I feel a sense of tension like none I have felt before and the weight of
responsibility of the real mission. Daily training is grueling, where I sometimes push myself to my mental and physical
limits so that I will be able to complete my mission under any circumstances. I will accomplish highly tense and responsible
real missions and severe training with pride and a high-minded sense of mission to protect our country, and continue daily
diligence to become a full-fledged fighter pilot quickly.

**(3) Expansion of the Recruitment of Female Personnel**
**a. Female SDF Personnel**

As of the end of March 2019, the number of female SDF
personnel is about 16,000 (about 6.9% of total SDF
personnel). Compared with ten years ago (end of March
2009, about 5.2% of total SDF personnel), this is a rise of
1.7 percentage points, indicating that the ratio of female SDF
personnel has been on the rise in recent years.
In order to increase the proportion of female SDF
personnel among total SDF personnel to over 9% by
FY2027, the MOD/SDF aims to ensure that women account
for more than 10% of total newly employed SDF personnel
in and after FY2017. Specifically, in order to increase the
number of recruits through such measures as the elimination
of the gender quota and the increase in the scheduled number
of female recruits, the SDF will actively recruit women,
promote their active participation, and improve education,
living, and work environments for female SDF personnel.
In addition, with regard to promotion, MDO/SDF aims
to increase the proportion of women among SDF personnel
with a rank of field officer or higher to over 3.1%. As for
the careers of the personnel anticipated to reach a rank of
field officer or higher, emphasis is given on assigning them
to a commander or assistant commander post at the rank of
company officer, with the hope of allowing them to gain
experience

is approximately 3,300 (about 24.6% of total civilian
personnel). Compared with ten years ago (end of March 2009
when females made up 23% of the total civilian personnel),
this is a rise of 1.6 percentage points, indicating that the ratio
of female civilian personnel is on a rising trend in recent
years.
With regard to recruitment, in line with the overall
government target, the MOD has set up its goal of ensuring
that women account for over 30% of recruits in and after
FY2016. Regarding promotion, as a goal to be achieved by
the end of FY2020, the proportion of women of the DivisionDirector level at local organizations and Assistant-DivisionDirector level at the ministry proper or equivalent would
be approximately 5%, and the proportion of women of the
Division-Director level at the ministry proper or equivalent
would be approximately 2%, and the proportion of women
of the Unit-Chief level at the ministry proper or equivalent
should be approximately 27%.

**3** **Enhancement of Medical Functions**


For the SDF to perform its mission, SDF personnel
must remain in good health through appropriate health
management. Also, it is important for the SDF to always seek
to enhance its capabilities in military medicine for protecting
the lives of the personnel engaging in a variety of services as
much as possible.
Under the circumstances where the SDF’s missions are
becoming more diverse and internationalized, it is important

**1** **Enhancing Seamless Medical Care and Evacuation Posture**

1 Enhancement of Medical Functions in Various
Emergency Situations


In order to respond to various emergency situations, the MOD/
SDF will enhance a seamless medical care and evacuation
posture from the frontline to the final transport destination, while
considering joint operation, in accordance with the MTDP.
Specifically, for the purpose of providing maximum
protection for the lives of personnel injured on the frontline,
the MOD/SDF will enhance medical functions for seamless
implementation of a series of medical care and transportation
starting from emergency life support by Frontline Medics[1] and
damage control surgery (DCS)[2] at a medical base equipped with
a field operation system[3] to safe and speedy transportation to
a SDF hospital that is the final destination for complete cure.
Other measures necessary for the implementation of the above
will be taken, including the sharing of a patient information


to appropriately and accurately carry out various medical
activities, such as medical support in disaster relief and
international peace keeping activities, and capacity building
assistance in the medical field.
The MOD/SDF, therefore, is enhancing and strengthening
its medical capabilities to be able to appropriately respond to
various emergency events and carry out its various missions
in Japan and abroad.

introduction of armored ambulances.
On this occasion, MOD/JSDF plans to strengthen the
organization of the Joint Staff Office for control and coordination
concerning SDF medical operation on a daily basis.


**Chapter**


2 Enhancement of Medical Functions
in the Southwestern Region


In the enhancement of seamless medical care and evacuation
posture, in light of the geological characteristics of Japan,
with its vast sea area and large number of remote islands, the
MTDP places a special focus on the enhancement of medical
functions in the southwestern region. Specifically, the MOD/
SDF will develop maintenance and evacuation guidelines for
medical bases in the region and improve the medical equipment
reserve system in Okinawa Island and minor islands.

**2** **SDF Hospitals as Hub Hospitals with Enhanced Functions**


will continue to concentrate human and medical resources
on the consolidation of SDF hospitals with increased
performance levels to establish an efficient and high-quality
medical care regime by improving their capacity as transfer
hospitals with a certain level of medical care in response to
infections, gunshot wounds, and other trauma and injury
caused by NBC weapons in addition to general practice. SDF
hospitals have been also advancing regional medical care.


The role of SDF hospitals is to admit and treat injured SDF
personnel and other persons transported from their area of
activity in various emergency situations, while in normal
circumstances these hospitals provide medical care to SDF
personnel and their families, etc. These hospitals also play the
role of educational institutions that train medical personnel
and maintain and enhance their skills.

particular, accepted about 5,600 ambulances in 2018.
When the Hokkaido Eastern Iburi Earthquake occurred
in September 2018, many hospitals did not function due to
a massive blackout or other reasons. However, SDF Sapporo
Hospital, which had been rebuilt with the design of a disasterresilient hospital (opened in 2015) maintained its functions
intact and started carrying out treatment just after the disaster.
SDF Central Hospital, with the participation of GSDF
Eastern Army, GSDF Medical School, Tokyo Fire Department,
Metropolitan Police Department, Setagaya Ward, Setagaya

As the only educational institution of the MOD/SDF for
the training of SDF personnel who are physicians (medical
officers), SDF personnel who are public health and registered
nurses (nursing officers) and technical officers, the National
Defense Medical College plays the role to train and produce
the primary medical staff for the medical activities of the
SDF as well as to maintain and improve their skills.
In this context, the NDPG and the MTDP state that the
MOD/SDF will improve the operations of the National
Defense Medical College and enhance its research functions,
and endeavor to secure high-quality talents.
Specifically, the MOD/SDF will strengthen the system
for training of excellent medical and nursing officers, and

The MOD/SDF will also enhance research functions of
the Research Institute of the National Defense Medical
College and collaboration with medical care departments
of the GSDF, MSDF, and ASDF. Through these initiatives
the MOD/SDF will further enhance the education/ research
conditions at the college.

in areas such as infectious diseases and emergency medicine,
as well as increasing their motivation for work. Through these
measures the MOD/SDF is working to improve the sufficiency
of medical officers and maintain and improve their medical
skills. In the MTDP, the MOD/SDF will continue efforts to
improve the sufficiency and further promote the appointment
of SDF Reserve Personnel who are physicians to handle
missions that are expected to increase.
Similar measures are taken for nursing officers to maintain
and improve their knowledge/skills through practice at
external hospitals, etc.
Moreover, medical personnel and medical staff, such
as radiological technologists, clinical technologists, and

While greater abilities are required of personnel engaged in
medical care, such as medical officers, due to the diversification
of missions, only 80% of the positions have been filled in the
case of medical officers, although the rate has been improving
year by year. Such low sufficiency is caused by medical officers
leaving the SDF, one of the major reasons of which is the lack
of opportunity to engage in medical training and practice. The
MOD/SDF continues to implement various measures with
various career options to prevent medical officers from leaving
the SDF by enhancing clinical education after graduation from
the National Defense Medical College and other institutions,
promoting various initiatives for ensuring more opportunities
for medical officers to engage in medical practice, helping

In order to improve first aid capabilities on the frontline, and
damage control surgeries and treatment while transferring the
injured, the MOD/SDF has conducted research on relevant
initiatives taken by the U.S. Forces and others, carried out
reviews for appropriate and accurate life-saving activities,
and enhancing education, training and research, including
improvement of capabilities to treat combat injuries.
For the improvement of first aid capabilities on the
frontline, since FY2017 the MOD has been providing
specific education and training for SDF personnel who are
certified as both Licensed Practical Nurses and Emergency
Life-Saving Technicians to acquire necessary knowledge and
skills, so that the SDF personnel with these qualifications will
be able to provide specialized relief treatments[4] on the spot to

transfer to SDF hospitals and other medical facilities. SDF
personnel who have completed this education and training
curriculum have been designated as “Frontline Medics”
and allocated to units. The SDF is also improving medical
materials to be carried by the Frontline Medics.
In addition to medical care on the frontline, based on the
MTDP, the SDF will enhance education and training tailored
to the characteristics of the units and equipment of the GSDF,
MSDF, and ASDF, which include medical care on board ship
or plane, while promoting development of medical training
infrastructure necessary for combat injury education and
common to all SDFs.


**Chapter**


**6** **Developing Conditions Necessary for International Cooperation**


In light of the response to the Ebola virus disease outbreak in
West Africa in 2014, the MOD/SDF is accelerating training
of human resources with expertise to contribute to overseas
activities against infectious diseases that could be a global
threat and to the development of a framework including
the National Defense Medical College, while at the same
time making various efforts to improve the capabilities to

respond to infectious diseases. Specifically, the MOD/SDF is
currently improving the necessary facility equipment at units,
the National Defense Medical College Hospital and the SDF
Central Hospital. The aims of this improvement are to provide
personnel training for the enhancement of capabilities to deal
with infectious diseases, improve equipment to transport
infectious disease patients and develop readiness for offering
medical treatment to patients affected by Class I infectious
diseases,[5] which are classified as the most dangerous
category among known infectious diseases. The SDF Central
Hospital and the National Defense Medical College Hospital
were designated as a medical institution for Class I infectious
diseases in April 2017 and March 2019 respectively and have
been working to improve capabilities to deal with infectious
diseases.


SDF medical units engage in international cooperation
including international disaster relief operations and capacity
building assistance for foreign military forces. They have
provided medical care in overseas disaster-struck areas and
are actively assisting mostly Asian countries in their capacity
building in such medical fields as underwater medicine,
aeromedicine and disaster medicine.

For the future, the MOD/SDF will develop systems
necessary for various international cooperation initiatives,
which include the updating of mobile medical systems that
are effective for overseas medical activities and dispatch of
SDF personnel to the medical departments of international
organizations, the U.S. Forces and others.

further promote initiatives to optimize equipment structure.
The Medium Term Defense Program (FY2019-2023; MTDP)[1]
provides that the MOD/SDF will work on the following items
to build an effective and optimized equipment structure from
the perspective of joint operation.


on autonomous unmanned weapon systems equipped with
artifi cial intelligence (AI). Further technological innovations
will make it even more diffi cult to forecast future combat
aspects.
Amid such a situation, it is essential to work on (1)
reviewing equipment structure, (2) reinforcing technology
base, (3) optimizing equipment procurement, (4)
strengthening defense industrial base, and (5) promoting
defense equipment and technology cooperation in order to
ensure a necessary and suffi cient defense capability in terms
of both quality and quantity for the construction of a Multidomain Defense Force.

In view of the severe security environment surrounding Japan
and the rapid development of the aging population with
a declining birth rate, it is important to maximize defense
capability by effectively utilizing the limited human resources
to the utmost. Therefore, the MTDP plans to actively work on
manpower saving and automation of defense equipment.

1 Initiatives for Automation


The MTDP plans to actively promote initiatives towards
automation through such means as the introduction of AI to data
processing and decision making regarding unit operation, the
procurement of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs), and R&D of
unmanned surface vehicles (USVs) and unmanned underwater
vehicles (UUVs).
Specifically, the MOD/SDF will actively promote the use
of unmanned equipment, which includes procurement of
Global Hawk and Ship-Based Unmanned Aerial Vehicles of
the MSDF, and consideration to introduce long-endurance
UAVs to strengthen offshore surveillance capabilities on
the vast Pacific side, while at the same time establishing a
structure including a new specialized section that handles
the planning of AI utilization. The MOD/SDF also plans to
promote research on UUV with convertible mission modules
and research on the detection of suspicious ships based on
analysis of data of an automatic identification system (AIS)
using AI.


2 Initiatives for Manpower Saving


The MTDP plans to actively promote initiatives to save
manpower through such means as streamlining in the design
of new types of destroyers (FFM) and submarines and use
of remote control for radar sites and other equipment. Other
initiatives include the introduction of patrol vessels that can
be operated by a smaller crew (about 30 members) through
dedication to Intelligence, Surveillance, and Reconnaissance
(ISR).

defense equipment and ensuring Japan’s security. Also, the
improvement of the technology base is a pressing issue. The
state-of-the-art military technologies in each country are
sensitive technologies that must not be easily shared with
other countries. From the perspective of Japan, for the areas,
which should strategically maintain their domestic technology
base, it is necessary to promote research and development
domestically. In the cases of defense equipment and technology
cooperation, such as equipment procurement and international
joint development, it is important to maintain the leading role by
owning important cutting-edge technology (key technology).
This requires not only research and development by the MOD,
but also the promotion of research and development by both
the public and private sectors together.

scientific technology. In addition, the MOD develops and
publishes the Medium- to Long-Term Defense Technology
Outlook (see Paragraph 2 below) to identify advanced
technology fields, which have the potential to become game
**changers.**
(ii) Development of Technologies
The MOD formulates the “Research and Development
Vision” (see Paragraph 3 below) that promotes medium- to
long-term research and development. At the same time, the
MOD also promotes research and development that serve
as the foundation of defense force building and initiatives
such as “Innovative Science & Technology Initiative for
Security,” which puts into perspective the identification and
development of advanced technology expected to be used
for technology exchange with relevant domestic/overseas
agencies and defense purposes.
(iii) Protection of Technologies
The MOD implements technology control for proper
technology transfer to prevent situations in which Japan’s
technology leaks without the country’s intention, undermining
the maintenance of the peace and security of the international
community or ensuring Japan’s technological superiority.
The MOD also establishes intellectual property management
taking into account the transfer of defense equipment and
promotes the utilization of intellectual property.


will facilitate the integration of superior civilian advanced
technologies and the development of technologies outside
of the ministries aimed at defense equipment applications.
Review is now underway for taking a more strategic
approach to important technologies, including technologies
pertaining to new domains and other potentially gamechanging technologies such as AI.

3 “Research and Development (R&D)Vision”


The “Research and Development (R&D) Vision” presents
principles on R&D, technological challenges, and roadmaps
on R&D of the technologies required for our future defense
capability for the purpose of conducting advanced R&D
systematically from a mid-to-long term viewpoint.
The MOD publishes R&D Vision, and shares them with
the defense industry, with the aim of increasing predictability
for relevant companies, promoting prior investment,
and realizing more effective and efficient research and
development by maximally exploiting the investment. So
far, the MOD prepared and published the “R&D Vision on
the Future Fighter Aircraft” in 2010 and the “R&D Vision
on Future Unmanned Equipment: Focusing on Unmanned
Aerial Vehicle” in 2016. The MOD is currently conducting
various research and study that can serve as a common
foundation for unmanned aircraft, etc.
In August 2019, the MOD published the “Research and
Development (R&D) Vision—Toward Realization of MultiDomain Defense Force and Beyond” in order to contribute
to the realization of Multi-Domain Defense Force and to
achieve technological innovation necessary for further
strengthening defense capability. Considering the direction
of policy, operational needs, changes in technological trends
and others, the MOD will continue to review R&D Vision, as
well as establish and publish Visions on new themes.

in strategically important equipment and technology fi elds
through focused investment in technologies in new domains,
potentially game-changing cutting-edge technologies such as
AI, and other important technologies. Specifi cally, the MOD
has been making efforts to greatly shorten the research and
development periods of Hyper Velocity Gliding Projectile
intended for the defense of remote islands, UUV, hypersonic
weapons, and other equipment through fl exible and active use
of new methods such as block approach and modularization.
At the same time, the MOD/SDF has been working on
visualization of the capabilities of future equipment by
analyzing alternatives (AOA) in technological demonstration
at the initial stage of R&D. The MOD also conducts research
regarding a high-energy laser system (HEL) that responds
to such threats as a large number of small unmanned aerial
vehicles that fl y at a low altitude and mortar shells at a low
cost and with a short reaction time. Furthermore, the MOD
effi ciently and effectively conducts research on UUVs, etc.
using dual-use technologies based on the “Basic Policy on
the Relocation of Governmental Organizations”[2] along with
developing a new test and evaluation facility “Iwakuni Test
Evaluation Facility (provisional name)” in Iwakuni City.
The facility is also available for use by the civilian sector,
including local institutions for higher education and research
institutes.
In addition, based on the MTDP, the MOD is working to

**4** **Active Utilization of Civilian Technology**

1 1 Strengthening Technology Exchange with Relevant
Domestic and Overseas Entities and Collaboration
with Relevant Ministries and Agencies


The Acquisition, Technology & Logistics Agency (ATLA)
and domestic research institutions, such as universities and
independent administrative institutions, proactively engage
in research collaborations and technological information
exchanges in order to ensure that advanced civilian
technology is incorporated and effi cient research and
development is conducted.
At the same time, in order to create excellent defense
equipment through the utilization of advanced technologies
and effectively and effi ciently conduct R&D, the MOD
will ensure cross-sectoral and substantial coordination
at the Council for Science, Technology and Innovation
(CSTI)[3] and other control tower meetings[4] based on the
Integrated Innovation Strategy (Cabinet Decision on June
15, 2018). The ministry also actively participates in the

strengthen and expand cooperation with countries who
are making large-scale investments in game-changing
technologies, such as the U.S. and special strategic
partner countries, and promote mutually complementary
international joint R&D. The MOD/SDF is also conducting
studies to reinforce its structure aimed at early discovery of
innovative, emerging technologies and fostering thereof by
utilizing and creating think tanks that survey and analyze the
latest foreign and domestic technological trends.


Council for Integrated Innovation Strategy[5] established
for its promotion in order to further enhance collaboration
with relevant ministries and agencies, national research
and development agencies, industry, universities, and other
parties. Furthermore, the MOD will further strengthen human
exchange with research institutes, etc. in order to understand
trends of civilian technologies for complementary and
synergistic improvement of technological capabilities.
As international cooperative activities, the MOD will
continue Japan-U.S. joint research and engineer exchanges, and
continuously consider diverse possibilities through continued
opinion exchange with other countries at various opportunities
while closely observing their technology strategies, etc.

“Visualization” of molecular bonding for adhesives is one of the issues of our research group. Adhesion of carbon fiber
reinforced plastics (CFRPs) is widely applied in weight sensitive structures such as aircraft and spacecraft due to the
excellence of CFRPs in terms of their high strength-to-weight and stiffness-to-weight ratios. However, full demonstration
of the excellence has been difficult due to the adhesion design method of accepting an extra margin for bonding error
and the wide distribution of bonding strength. Therefore, our team introduced scanning electrochemical microscopy
(SECM), which is a new tool in biotechnology, fuel cell engineering, and so on, to seek the detrimental factors of bonding
and succeeded in the visualization of adhesive performance distribution for the
first time. Further development of this technology, we believe, will solve the
adhesion problems to realize future aerospace structures that utilize CFRPs’ full
performance. Our team is on the final term since the start of this three-year-project,
under the sincere support by the program officer, not only in the form of technical
comments and advice but also in the form of discussion opportunities with other
teams in different fields to provide us with hints and new ideas. The excellence of
program design also drives forward our team, especially the stable salary system

2 Innovative Science & Technology Initiative for
Security and Its Utilization future, but is also beneficial for the development of Japan’s

science, technology and innovation in non-defense areas as
well, similar to how investment in innovative technology by
the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA)
of the United States facilitated advances in science and
technology as a whole including civilian technology, such
as the development of the Internet and GPS. From this
perspective, the MOD intends to promote relevant measures
and strives to raise awareness of this program that contributes
to ensuring the freedom of study and its sound development.
In April 2019, an organizational change[7] was carried out
for the unified implementation of translational research in
order to connect the results of advanced basic research to
the research and development of specific equipment. Those
research results will be acquired through such efforts as
technology exchange with relevant domestic and overseas
entities, enhanced collaboration with relevant ministries and
agencies, and use of the “Innovative Science & Technology
Initiative for Security” program for the R&D of specific
equipment.

See Fig. IV-2-2-2 (FY2018 Awarded Research Projects for the
“Innovative Science & Technology Initiative for Security”
program)


In FY2015 the MOD launched a competitive research
funding program called “Innovative Science & Technology
Initiative for Security” to discover creative research activities
conducted in universities, research institutes, companies,
etc., which are expected to apply defense equipment in the
future and to promote promising research seeds. A total of
53 research projects were awarded[6] by FY2018, this program
was expanded in FY2017 in order to enable the awards of
larger-scale and longer-term research projects. The program
will continue to run on a similar scale in FY2019 (total
budget of about 10.1 billion yen).
In the basic research areas, free thinking of researchers
leads to innovative and creative results. For this reason,
it is necessary to assign maximum value to freedom of
research when sponsoring research, so that, for example,
researchers will be able to publish all of their research
results to have a wide range of academic discussions. Hence,
in this program the MOD will neither restrict contractors’
publication of research results, nor designate research results
as confidential, never providing any confidential data to
researchers. In actuality, some research results have already
been published through oral presentations, publications, etc.
Active utilization of advanced civilian technology
through such programs is not only essential for securing the
lives and peaceful livelihood of the Japanese people into the

Strategy. In August 2018, Analysis and Evaluation of the
acquisition programs were developed for 16 items for which
the Acquisition Strategy, etc. had been developed.

See Fig. IV-2-3-1 (Equipment for Project Management and

See

Equipment for Semi-Project Management)


1 Acquisition of Defense Equipment through Focused
Project Management


As defense equipment is becoming more sophisticated and
complex, its entire life cycle (concept study, research and
development, mass production, deployment, operation and
maintenance) cost has a tendency to increase in recent years.
It has become extremely important to streamline acquisition
throughout the life cycle of equipment and to establish a
systematic management to realize the streamlining in order to
efficiently acquire equipment of assured quality at appropriate
cost in a required timeline as planned.
Therefore, since the establishment of ATLA in October
2015, the Department of Project Management in ATLA
undertakes project management throughout the life cycle of
equipment upon selecting important equipment, and promotes
efforts to realize the optimized equipment acquisition.
Specifically, the MOD has selected 17 items for major
programs designated for project management and 3 items for
semi-major programs for project management[1] as of the end
of March 2019. The MOD designated Project Managers (PM)
dedicated to specific major programs. At the same time, the
MOD established a systematic project management system
by setting up the Integrated Project Team (IPT), which is
composed of officials from relevant divisions within the
Ministry.
So far (as of the end of March 2019), for 19 out of 20 items
that have been selected for major and semi-major programs,
the MOD has formulated the Acquisition Strategy and the
Acquisition Plan (hereinafter referred to as “Acquisition
Strategy, etc.”), which specify the basic matters necessary to
systematically implement project management, such as the
purpose of the acquisition program, acquisition policy, and life
cycle cost. The Acquisition Strategy, etc. shows strategic plans
to realize optimized acquisitions of equipment.
Furthermore, in principle, ATLA annually confirms the
project implementation status with each SDF service, and
endeavors to promote appropriate project management
reflecting the latest situation by developing Analysis and
Evaluation, which compiles changes made in acquisition
plans from the previous fiscal year, and reviews Acquisition

2 Initiatives to Promote and Strengthen Project
Management


**(1) Past Initiatives**

The following initiatives have been implemented to promote
and strengthen project management.
**a. Cost and Schedule Management Using WBS**

For certain kinds of equipment produced in Japan, the MOD
is promoting the introduction of a management method
to visualize the progress of work and cost generated by
component (Work Breakdown Structure [WBS][2]) and
endeavors to manage cost and schedule to detect the signs of
cost increase and schedule delay early so that swift measures
can be taken.
**b. Method for More Accurate Cost Estimate**

Life cycle cost and other costs have been estimated based on
actual cost data of similar equipment developed or introduced
in the past. However, as a larger amount of cost data is
needed for a more accurate estimate, the MOD promotes the
establishment of a cost database by collecting cost data and
accumulating them into a database.
**c. Accumulation and Development of Expertise through**
**Strengthened Cooperation with Research and Educational**
**Institutions, etc.**

For further improving the management skills of Project
Managers and enhancing human resources among those
who engage in project management, the MOD strengthens
collaboration with research and educational institutions on
project management and provides opportunities to study
project management methods from overseas and the private
sector on a regular basis.

**(2) Future Initiatives**

In order to further promote effective and efficient equipment
acquisition, the MOD needs to enhance the effectiveness and


A semi-major project is an acquisition project of specific equipment with a limited application of project management without the designation of PM and IPT, focusing on risks in functions,
performance, costs, schedules and other risk factors as in the case of equipment for project management.

take new initiatives, including undertakings that contribute
to cost reduction at mass production stage as a requirement
at the development stage, incorporating successful examples
in the civilian sector into the manufacture of defense
equipment, and actively adopting the competitive bidding
method and other contracting methods that contribute to the
utilization of private sector knowledge and expertise and

**2** **Improving the Contract System and Other Related Matters**

1 Reviewing Acquisition Systems


For the purpose of promoting acquisition reform, which is a
prompt response to swiftly changing surroundings, the MOD

Reform Committee since 2007, in addition to the Contractual
Systems Study Groups held since 2010 to review acquisition
systems. Since FY2016, a special research offi cer system[3]

the items subject to project management and strive to adjust
the standards for the specifi cations and the review of project
plans with consideration of life cycle costs. Furthermore, for
more effi cient acquisition, during the equipment selection
phase, the MOD will implement thorough life cycle cost
estimation, analysis of alternatives and secure binding
obligations against company principals.

has been adopted in order to surely bring the review results
to fruition.

procured in bulk, in many cases a contract for more than


This is a system to conduct research, which contributes to the acquisition system of defense equipment, by inviting experts, such as associate professors from different universities

five years is needed. With regard to defense equipment and
services, economies of scale[4] tend not to work mainly due
to the following reasons: (1) the MOD is the only customer;
and (2) companies that provide such defense equipment,
etc., are limited. In addition, it is difficult for companies to
systematically move forward with their businesses with a
high degree of predictability, which is peculiar to the defense
industry.
For these reasons, the upper limit of acts that incur
national debt prescribed in the Public Finance Act as within

five years in principle was changed to within ten years for
specific equipment through the enactment of the Long-term
Contract Act.[5] The introduction of this change regarding
long-term contracts will make stable procurement possible,
leading to the realization of the systematic improvement of
defense capability. At the same time, for companies, given
that the procurement amount will be assured, the systematic
use of personnel and equipment, as well as cost reductions
due to bulk orders, will be made possible.

See Fig. IV-2-3-2 (Image of Long-term Contracts and the Cost

Reduction Effect)
Part II, Chapter 4, Section 3-3 (Initiatives for Greater
Efficiency)

In addition, by realizing longer-term multiple-year
contracts utilizing the Private Finance Initiative (PFI) Act,[6]
the planned acquisition and execution of budgets is achieved


through the standardization of investment amounts of the
national expenditure, and certain benefits are obtained, such
as cutting equipment procurement costs, by reducing risks
for those taking orders and by promoting the entry of new
suppliers. As projects using the PFI Act, the MOD launched
the “project of development and operation of X-band satellite
communications” in January 2013 and the “project of
operation and management of private ships” in March 2016.
In addition, regarding procurement of certain equipment
with which little competitiveness can be expected due to its
characteristics, and companies that work on cost reduction
using the MOD’s programs, the MOD promotes limited
tendering contracts while ensuring transparency and fairness
as well as clarifying and putting the subject into patterns,
from the perspective of the implementation of smooth and
efficient procurement, and the enhancement of the company’s
predictability.
Specifically, as a new initiative, in acquiring new
destroyers,[7] the MOD has adopted a procurement method
to acquire the new destroyers efficiently equipped with
the necessary functions and to maintain and strengthen the
construction technology base since February 2017. This is
done by selecting a party that has made the best proposal
with respect to the MOD’s requirements as a procurement
counterparty, with the runner-up also involved in designing


“Economies of scale” refers to the cost advantage that arises with an increased output of a product. For example, costs per unit can be reduced by a bulk purchase of materials.

and building facilities as a subcontractor. The MOD concluded
a proposal agreement in April 2017 and decided on a
procurement counterparty and a subcontractor in August 2017.

3 Decrease Procurement Cost and Improve
Companies’ Incentives to Reduce Cost


With regard to the procurement of defense equipment, there
is a large variety of equipment without a market price, and
therefore, they tend to have high prices. In light of this
characteristic, it is necessary to achieve both the reduction of
procurement cost and improvement of companies’ incentives
to reduce cost simultaneously. Thus, the MOD has been
striving to achieve the reduction of procurement prices by
confirming the actual costs incurred and ensuring that no
excessive business profit will be added after the execution


of the contract through cost audit contracts with a special
provision requiring respective companies to conduct a review
of the contract sum and return any excessive profit (audit
contracts incorporating a provision requiring the return of
excessive profit).
However, it has also been noted that these contracts
diminish the companies’ motivation for cost reduction as
they would be required to return excessive profits after the
completion of the contract payment at the end of the fiscal

1 Effective and Efficient Maintenance and
Replenishment


With regard to periodic maintenance checks of defense
equipment, the MOD has been working to achieve greater
efficiency by extending the interval between the maintenance
checks, after making sufficient effort to ensure safety.
In addition, the MOD embarks on the introduction of
Performance Based Logistics (PBL)[8] from the perspective of
improving the equipment availability ratio and long-term cost
reductions. The Ministry is also reviewing the maintenance
methods. In the FY2019 budget, reduction of the maintenance
and operating costs is expected by grouping hardware and
software that were rented for each information system.

See Part II, Chapter 4, Section 3-3 (Initiatives for Increasing the

Efficiency of Procurement)

2 Achieving Further Efficiency in the Acquisition of
Defense Equipment


When acquiring defense equipment, the MOD aims to reduce
development, acquisition, and maintenance expenses through
the development of product families, standardization of
equipment specifications, joint procurement of equipment
common to multiple SDF services, etc., in addition to a review
of the contract system. In the FY2019 budget, cost reduction is
expected by switching to import of complete F-35As.
In addition, the MOD is facilitating the compilation of a
database on the breakdown of procurement price and actual
price of major equipment in the past. The Ministry expects


3 Efforts to Increase Fairness and Transparency


The MOD implements measures for making contracts more
appropriate and strengthening checking functions to promote
the enhancement of fairness and transparency in relation to
the acquisition of equipment and materials.
As a part of the effort to “make public procurement more
appropriate” across the whole government, the MOD continues
to carry out the introduction and expansion of a comprehensive
evaluation bidding system[9] and make bidding procedures
more efficient. In addition to these, based on reflection on the
past, strengthening system investigation, reviewing penalties,
ensuring the effectiveness of supervision and inspection,
and other measures have steadily been carried out in order
to prevent recurrence of such incidents as overcharging and
falsified results of equipment testing by defense-related
companies in 2012. Through these measures, the MOD strives
to surely prevent recurrence of scandals, enhance fairness and
transparency, and make contracts more appropriate.
In addition, ATLA carries out multilayered checks
through both internal and external checking systems and
check-and-balance within the organization – namely, ATLA


PBL is a contract method that involves payment of compensation according to the level of equipment performance achieved in terms of availability ratio and stable stock. It has achieved
positive outcomes upon application to the maintenance and servicing of equipment in Western countries.

Unlike the automatic bid system, which focuses only on price, this is a system whereby the successful bidder is determined on the basis of a comprehensive evaluation that includes both

**4** **Promoting Initiative towards Streamlining of Foreign Military Sales (FMS) Procurement**


FMS is a form of U.S. security assistance authorized by
the Arms Export Control Act (AECA) etc. that may enable
the U.S. allies and others to purchase defense equipment
and services from the U.S. government and is not intended
for making economic profits. The characteristics of FMS
include: (1) pricing is an estimate, (2) payments are made
in advance in principle and balanced out in effect after
fulfillment, and (3) the delivery date is an estimate. This
program allows Japan to procure equipment with a high level
of confidentiality that cannot be generally purchased through
Direct Commercial Sales and highly capable equipment
which can only be manufactured by the United States.
Therefore, FMS is critical to strengthen Japan’s defense

compliance awareness by providing thorough education
pertaining to compliance for ATLA personnel.

capabilities.
Meanwhile, there are FMS-related challenges, such as
ensuring cost transparency and late case closures. As the
FMS procurement amount is rising, the MOD has been
actively working to make improvements in these challenges.
Specific efforts for streamlining FMS procurement include
promoting equipment acquisition by aligning the timing
of procurement and specification with the U.S. Forces’
equipment to reduce cost, and strengthening cooperation with
the U.S. government through close Japan-U.S. consultations
to attempt improving cost transparency while reducing costs
and enhancing execution management.

**4** **Strengthening Defense Industrial Base**


Strong industrial base is essential for ensuring the production
and a high operation rate of high-performance equipment. For
this purpose, the MOD established the Strategy on Defense
Production and Technological Bases in June 2014 to maintain

**1** **Current Situation of Japan’s Defense Industrial Base**


The term “defense industrial base” refers to the human,
physical, and technological bases that are essential for the
production, operation, sustainment, and maintenance of
defense equipment required for the MOD/SDF’s activities. In
Japan, most of the base is covered by companies (the defense
industry) that manufacture defense equipment and associated
items. Therefore, a broad range of companies[2] that possess
special and advanced skills and facilities are involved in the
defense production and technological bases. Meanwhile,
the degree of defense demand dependence (the ratio of
defense-related sales that account for all company sales) is
approximately 3% on average, indicating that defense business
is not the primary business in many companies.[3] Furthermore,


and strengthen the base. For the future, the ministry will
make the defense industrial base more resilient, enabling to
effectively adapt to a changing security environment based on
the NDPG,[1] etc.

unit costs and maintenance/sustainment costs tend to increase
due to low-volume, high mix production and the sophistication
and complication of defense equipment. For this reason,
Japan’s defense industrial base faces some issues, such as
difficulties in maintaining and passing on skills and techniques,
and withdrawal of some companies from defense businesses
because work quantity is decreasing due to a decrease of
procurement volume.
In addition, as the realignment of the Western defense
industries and international joint development are making
progress, Japan formulated the Three Principles on Transfer
of Defense Equipment and Technology in April 2014.
However, improvement of international competitiveness has


See Part II, Chapter 3, Section 1, Footnote 1

For example, it is said that approximately 1,100, 1,300 and 8,300 companies are involved in the manufacture of fighter aircraft tanks and destroyers, respectively.

According to the survey of defense demand dependence conducted on 46 defense-related companies based on their sales performance in FY2015. Although relatively small in scale, some
companies possess important technologies for supporting the defense industry with over 50% of the defense demand dependence, in which case the scale of defense demand has a

1 Context of Formulation of the Strategy on Defense
Production and Technological Bases, etc.


For the purpose of maintaining and strengthening Japan’s
defense production and technological bases, which is
an important and essential element supporting Japan’s
defense capability, the “Strategy on Defense Production and
Technological Bases” was formulated in June 2014. The
Strategy responded to the National Security Strategy and
the 2013 NDPG, replacing “Kokusankahoshin (guideline for
domestic development/production).”[4]

See Reference 5 (National Security Strategy [Outline])

**(4) Defense Equipment Procurement Methods**

With regard to defense equipment procurement, currently
multiple methods, such as domestic development,
international joint development and production, licensed
domestic production, utilization of commercially produced
goods, and imports, are adopted. These methods directly
affect the defense production and technological bases.
According to the characteristics of defense equipment, the
MOD appropriately selects acquisition methods, including
international joint development and production, which have
become more agile and flexible due to the Three Principles
on Transfer of Defense Equipment and Technology.

collaboration with other relevant ministries and government
agencies.

**(6) Courses of Actions for Each Defense Equipment Sectors**

With regard to the main defense equipment sectors (such as
land equipment, supplies, etc., ships, aircraft, explosives,
guided weapons, communications electronics and command
control systems, unmanned equipment, space systems and
cyber), the MOD will analyze the current situation of defense
production and technological bases. At the same time, based
on the priority matters for developing the SDF’s structure
indicated in the 2013 NDPG, the MOD will present the future
direction of the maintenance and strengthening of defense
production and technological bases and the acquisition plan
for each defense equipment sectors, and thereby, seek to
increase predictability for companies.


**Chapter**


**(5) Measures for Maintaining and Strengthening Defense**
**Production and Technological Bases**

In order to maintain and strengthen defense production
and technological bases, the MOD will promote the
following measures with a focus on variation and efficiency,
while considering Japan’s severe financial condition: (1)
improvement in the contract system; (2) initiatives in research

**3** **Initiatives Based on the 2018 NDPG**

1 Past Initiatives


Based on the Strategy on Defense Production and
Technological Bases, the MOD has implemented various
measures contributing to the maintenance and strengthening

of the defense industrial base, such as improving the contract
system, including the Long-term Contract Act, and the
establishment of ATLA, which integrated the organizations
involved in the defense equipment procurement.
In addition, the following new measures are also taken in
ATLA: (1) formulation of Defense Technology Strategy, etc.
for ensuring the technological superiority, and implementation
of the “Innovative Science & Technology Initiative for
Security” (see Section 2); (2) formulation of the Acquisition
Strategic Plan for promoting project management, and
improvement of contract systems (see Section 3); (3) grasping
the supply chain in the defense industry and responses to risks
in order to maintain and strengthen the defense industrial base
(see Paragraph 2 below); and (4) participation of Japanese
companies in the international F-35 program and defense
equipment and technology cooperation involving joint
research and development with other countries (see Section 5).


2 Future Initiatives


In order to strengthen Japan’s defense industrial base, which
is essential to the production, operation, sustainment and
maintenance of defense equipment, the MOD will work on

the following initiatives based on the NDPG, etc., while
considering the orientation of the defense production and
technology strategy.

**(1) Reforming the Existing Contract System towards Creating**
**a Competitive Environment among Companies**

Japan’s defense industry has a poor competitive environment
as there are many defense equipment items that only one
company can produce. Furthermore, there is not much
incentive for cost reduction because equipment prices are
calculated using the cost accounting system.[5] To address
this issue, the MOD will review the existing contract system
towards creation of incentives and a competitive environment
among companies by actively evaluating initiatives and
results contributing to strengthening of the competitiveness
of the defense industry and cost reduction, and appropriately
reflecting the evaluation in companies’ profits through

the United States, etc.[7]

**(4) Promoting Appropriate Overseas Transfer of Defense**
**Equipment under the Three Principles on Transfer of**
**Defense Equipment and Technology**

The government as a whole will work on necessary
improvement in implementation or related rules for promoting
appropriate overseas transfer of defense equipment. At the
same time, the MOD will strengthen intellectual property
management, technology control and information security
to prevent leakages of important technologies regarding
defense equipment.
**a. Initiatives for Necessary Operational Improvement**

The MOD, in cooperation with relevant ministries
and agencies, will work on necessary improvement in
implementation or related rules based on the Three Principles
on Transfer of Defense Equipment and Technology, which
are the operational standards for the Foreign Exchange
and Foreign Trade Act. As a result, the MOD will enhance
predictability for the defense industry and will promote
appropriate and smooth equipment transfer.
Specifically, the ministry thinks it is necessary to improve
the implementation of relevant systems and procedures,
which include rationalization of the handling of basic
marketing information necessary for early business talks at
international trade shows, etc.[8] in order to ensure the smooth
provision of such information.
**b. Preventing Leakage of Advantageous Technologies**
(a) Intellectual Property Management

Through the revision of contract provisions regarding
intellectual properties and other means, the MOD accurately
grasps the intellectual properties generated through R&D,
etc. to promote the clarification of belongings and prevention
of leakages of advantageous technologies to abroad. The
ministry also presents options regarding the opening or
closing of intellectual properties based on the characteristics
of the technology and promotes appropriate management for
each option.
(b) Technology Control

The MOD will strengthen technology control systems
and functions to ensure prompt and proper assessment of
technical sensitivity based on the importance and superiority
of the technologies, which is needed in the examination
of the propriety of overseas transfer of defense equipment


contracts.

**(2) Strengthening Risk Management of Supply Chain for**
**Defense Equipment**

The procurement of defense equipment involves not only
prime companies that directly contract with the MOD but
also supplier companies in a broad range of fields and sizes,
which contract with the prime companies. The chains of these
companies (supply chains) are the basis of Japan’s defense
industry. However, these supply chains are confronted
with risks, such as supply disruption due to withdrawing or
bankruptcy of some manufacturing companies. In order to
deal with the risks, the MOD is taking measures in order to
maintain and strengthen the supply chains.
In the supply chain survey conducted by the end of 2017[6],
as part of the efforts mentioned above, key suppliers holding
irreplaceable technologies were identified. Additionally,
vulnerabilities became apparent, such as a concentration
of orders to a certain supplier and the current condition that
a number of companies, mainly small and medium-sized
enterprises (SMEs), are highly dependent on defense demand.
Based on the survey results, the MOD is currently working
to (1) create a database by using the results of the supply
chain survey, (2) build a regular monitoring system for early
identification of risks, such as supply disruption, and (3)
promote spin-off to strengthen the business structure of SMEs.
For the future, the MOD will accurately deal with the
vulnerabilities in the supply chain and strengthen them through
initiatives such as (1) an in-depth supply chain survey with
a focus on specific defense equipment, (2) a study of using
other ministries’ support measures to cope with advancement
of technology and business succession in order to manage
supply disruption and other risks, and (3) a study of measures
to improve production efficiency of SMEs.

**(3) Further Participation of Japan’s Defense Industry in**
**Sustainment and Maintenance of Imported Equipment, etc.**

Participating in the sustainment and maintenance business
of imported equipment is productive for the strengthening
of Japan’s industrial base. For this purpose, it is important to
pursue participation in the sustainment and maintenance of
F-35A, Osprey, and other imported equipment and benefits
for domestic companies through further promotion of
international joint R&D of high-capability equipment with


By the end of FY2017, the MOD conducted a supply chain survey up to the secondary subcontractors of 30 major defense equipment items.

SM-3 block IIA, jointly developed by Japan and the United States, is subject to FMS procurement, but Japanese companies have received contracts for manufacturing about half of the
components, including those procured by the United States.

In October 2018, the Q&A section of the Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry website made it clear that information on the performance of goods and other matters that is used in early
stage business talks and that does not include “specific information necessary for design, manufacture or use,” such as design information and production technique, is not subject to
regulation under the Foreign Exchange Act. At the request of companies, the MOD is currently confirming the range of information included in data created by a company that may be

**Defense Industry Supporting Development of Defense Capabilities**

**President Shigenori Yamamoto, TERAUCHI MANUFACTURING Co., Ltd.**

TERAUCHI MANUFACTURING Co., Ltd. was founded in 1913, and used to manufacture nuts and bolts for airframes
and aircraft engines as a designated factory of the old Japanese Army and Navy until the end of World War II. After
the war, our major products shifted to nuts and bolts for automobiles. Around the time of the establishment of the Japan
Defense Agency, we resumed manufacturing of nuts and bolts for aircraft for the Air Self Defense Force as its designated
supplier. In 2002, the company withdrew from the general industry and has specialized in aerospace and gas turbine fields
to this day.
Nuts and bolts for aircraft have their roots in the United States Air Force standards, which specify material, shape,
production method, and other requirements in detail. After the heat treatment process, a screw thread is formed by thread
rolling while rotating the screw on a rolling machine. This method makes the metal structure denser than machining and
thereby increases its strength.
Our products are used for a wide variety of defense aircraft and incorporated into engines, landing gears, airframe
structure, and other parts. Each of them plays a very important role.
The fundamental principle of our company is “We will contribute to world peace and social development through
manufacturing.” We are proud to be able to protect the lives of crew members and contribute to the peace of Japan and the
world through our work under the absolute requirement: Flight Safety.

and technology. In order to prevent leakages of sensitive
technologies, the MOD, in cooperation with relevant
ministries and agencies, promotes studies of reverse
engineering countermeasure technologies, such as black box
constitution.
(c) Strengthening Information Security

For Japan’s defense industry to participate in international
businesses, it is necessary to respond to increasing threats
of cyber attacks. With the aim of strengthening information
security measures, the MOD will review the information
security standard applicable to contractors handling the
MOD’s information to be protected.[9]

In order to further encourage companies to consider
entry into defense procurement business and facilitate
their business with defense-related companies in Japan and
abroad, it is important to improve the predictability of the


necessary security measures for the companies. For this
purpose, the MOD will develop an information security
guidebook that comprehensively defines security measures
that will normally be required for concluding a contract,
which involves the handling of information to be secured,
with the MOD in advance.

**(5) Other Initiatives to Achieve Efficiency and Strength**

Other than the above-mentioned initiatives, the MOD/SDF
will undertake measures such as making the equipment
manufacturing process efficient and thorough cost reduction
and will strive to make Japan’s defense industry base
efficient and resilient while foreseeing possible realignment
and consolidation of businesses that may occur as a result of
these measures.

**5** **Defense Equipment and Technology Cooperation**


Based on the Three Principles on Transfer of Defense
Equipment and Technology, Japan promotes cooperation
in defense equipment and technology with other countries
in order to contribute to the maintenance and strengthening
of defense production and technological bases, as well as
contributing to the promotion of our national security, peace

**1** **Three Principles on Transfer of Defense Equipment and Technology**

1 Purpose of Establishment of the Three Principles on
Transfer of Defense Equipment and Technology


Japan has dealt with arms exports in a careful manner, in
accordance with the Three Principles of Arms Exports
and their related policy guidelines. On the other hand, in
individual cases, such as the participation of domestic
companies in the joint development of Ballistic Missile
Defense (BMD) by Japan and the United States, it has taken
separate measures in which arms exports are dealt with
outside the Three Principles.[1]

Amidst this situation, in April 2014, based on the
National Security Strategy, the Government formulated the
Three Principles on Transfer of Defense Equipment and
Technology as new principles replacing the Three Principles
on Arms Exports etc.[2] and its implementation guidelines. The
new principles clarified the concrete standards, procedures
and limitation.

See Reference 62 (Three Principles on Transfer of Defense

Equipment and Technology)


and international cooperation. Japan will continue to realize
effective defense equipment and technological cooperation
through the strengthening of intelligence gathering such as the
needs of its counterparts, cooperation including assistance for
maintenance and repair of equipment, and strengthening of
cooperative posture between the public and private sectors.

**(1) Clarification of Cases Where Transfers Are Prohibited (the**
**First Principle)**

The cases where overseas transfers of defense equipment
are prohibited are clarified as follows: (1) in the case
of violating the obligations under treaties and other
international agreements that Japan has concluded; (2) in the
case of violating the obligations based on the Resolution of
the United Nations Security Council; or (3) in the case of
transferring to the countries in conflicts.

See Fig. IV-2-5-1 (The First Principle “The Cases Where Transfers

See

Are Prohibited”)


**Chapter**


**(2) Limitation to Cases Where Transfers May Be Permitted**
**As Well As Strict Examination and Information Disclosure**
**(the Second Principle)**

The cases where transfers may be permitted are limited
to (1) cases that contribute to the active promotion of
peace contribution and international cooperation, (2) cases
that contribute to the security of Japan, or other cases.
The Government will conduct strict examination on the
appropriateness of the destination and end user, and on the
extent of the concerns that the overseas transfer of such
equipment and technology will raise for Japan’s security,


2 Main Contents of the New Three Principles

|(3) Transfer to a nation which is party to a confl ict|Countries which are the target of measures taken by the United Nations Security Council to maintain or restore international peace and security in the event of an armed attack|



In December 2011, the Statement by the Chief Cabinet Secretary on Guidelines for Overseas Transfer of Defense Equipment, etc. put in place exemptions from the Three Principles of Arms
Exports based on the premise of strict control, with regard to (1) cases related to peace contribution and international cooperation, and (2) cases regarding international joint development
and production of defense equipment, etc. that contributes to Japan’s security.

The term “defense equipment” is deemed appropriate for the title of “Three Principles for the Transfer of Defense Equipment and Technology,” since possible articles of overseas transfers
help with peace contribution and international cooperation as was seen in the example of the provision of bulldozers and other items belonging to the SDF to disaster-stricken countries.

light of this decision, the Japanese Government has been
working to enable the involvement of Japanese industries in
the manufacturing process in preparation for the acquisition
of F-35A fighter aircraft from FY2013 onwards. So far the
Japanese companies have participated in the Final Assembly
and Check Out (FACO) for airframe and engines, and the
manufacture of some engine parts (19 items), radar parts
(7 items), and Electro-Optical Distributed Aperture System
(EODAS)[3] parts (3 items).
In order to efficiently strengthen Japan’s defense
capabilities under the severe fiscal circumstances, it is
important to reduce prices of defense equipment. The MOD
compared the unit price assuming participation of domestic
companies in the production with the import price of
completed aircraft. Since the latter was lower, the ministry
decided to import completed F-35A fighters in FY2019 and
after in order to promptly procure necessary number.[4]

The MOD believes that the past participation of domestic
companies in the manufacturing of F-35A fighters was
meaningful because it has started to bring about the
ensuring of operational and maintenance bases as well as
the sustainment, development and advancement of fighterrelated technology bases through working with cutting-edge
fighter technologies and knowhow.
As global operation of F-35 fighter aircraft is anticipated,
the U.S. Government plans to establish maintenance depot
(regional MRO&U Capability) mainly for airframes and
engines in the North America, Europe, and the Asia-Pacific
regions. In December 2014, with regard to regional MRO&U
in the Asia-Pacific region for the F-35, the U.S. Government
announced the following decisions: (1) Regional MRO&U
Capability for airframes will be provided to Japan and
Australia with both capabilities required not later than early
2018;[5] (2) with regard to the regional MRO&U Capability
for engines, initial capability will be provided by Australia by
early 2018, with Japan providing additional capability at least
3-5 years later.[6]

Currently the MOD is preparing regional MRO&U
capability for airframes maintenance depot to handle


maintenance needs that may exceed the capability of SDF
maintenance units due to a malfunction of F-35A fighters of
the ASDF. In February 2019, the U.S. government announced
its decision to establish an MRO&U capability of some
avionics components for F-35s in the Pacific Region in Japan
after 2025 according to the need for maintenance.[7]

Establishing a maintenance depot for airframes, engines
and others within Japan, and contributing to maintenance in
the Asia-Pacific region are significant from the perspectives
of securing the operational support system for F-35A fighter
aircraft in Japan, maintaining the Japanese defense industrial
base, strengthening the Japan-U.S. Alliance, and deepening
equipment cooperation in the Asia-Pacific region.

**(2) Initiatives towards the Establishment of a Common**
**Maintenance Base of the Japan-U.S. Osprey**

As the Planned Maintenance Interval (PMI) of the U.S.
Marine Corps Ospreys deployed at Marine Corps Air Station
Futenma was scheduled to commence roughly in 2017, the
U.S. Navy carried out a public tender to select a maintenance
company. Fuji Heavy Industries Ltd[8] was selected as the
maintenance company for this purpose in October 2015.
From February 2017, the PMI has been performed at GSDF
Camp Kisarazu. In March 2019 maintenance of the first
aircraft was completed and the aircraft was delivered to the
U.S. Forces.
The MOD intends to establish a common maintenance base
for both Japan’s and the United States’ Osprey by allowing
the maintenance company to use the hangar at GSDF Camp
Kisarazu for aircraft maintenance of the U.S. Marine Corps
Osprey and also to implement the future aircraft maintenance
of the GSDF Osprey at the same camp from the following
perspectives: (1) smooth introduction of the GSDF Osprey
(V-22);[9] (2) smooth and effective operation of the JapanU.S. security arrangements; and (3) enhanced efficiency in
maintenance. The establishment of a common maintenance
base at GSDF Camp Kisarazu would be extremely significant
in that it will contribute mitigating the burden on Okinawa as
well as the “Strengthening the basis to repair and maintain
common equipment” stated in the new guideline.

As partner countries in the Asia-Pacific region have
expressed their interest and expectation regarding defense
equipment and technology cooperation with Japan, the MOD
proactively seeks to build relationships with these countries.

**(1) Australia**

With Australia, the Agreement between the Government
of Japan and the Government of Australia concerning the
Transfer of Defence Equipment and Technology[15] was
signed in July 2014.
Meanwhile, at the Japan-Australia Defence Ministerial
Meeting held in October 2014, it was agreed to seek
multifaceted cooperation, including the following: (1)
exploration of potential cooperation opportunities in the F-35
program; (2) acquisition reform dialogue with the Defence
Material Organisation of Australia; (3) at the request of the
Australian side, exploration of the possibility of Japanese
cooperation in the Australian Future Submarine Program;
(4) defense technology exchanges with the Defence Science
and Technology Organization of Australia (in the field of
marine hydrodynamics and exchanges among engineers
and scientists); and (5) talks between defense industries
in both countries. Subsequently, joint research on Marine
Hydrodynamics started in December 2015. Moreover, even
though Japan had submitted the proposal for the Future
Submarine Program in November 2015, the Government
of Australia announced in April 2016, that they selected a
French company as their partner for the Program.
The first meeting of the Japan-Australia Steering
Committee for Defence Equipment and Technology
Cooperation was held in October 2017. At the meeting,
opinions were exchanged on measures for further promotion
of defence equipment and technology cooperation between
the countries. The second meeting was held in June 2019,
where two countries deepened discussion.
In March 2018, the ATLA and the Department of Defence
of Australia jointly held the Japan-Australia Defence
Industry Forum. Japan is promoting defense equipment and
technology cooperation between the two countries through
such initiatives as the participation of C-2 transport aircraft in
Avalon International Airshow held in Australia in February
2019, to demonstrate the technical strength of Japan.

See Part III, Chapter 3, Section 1-2-1 (Australia)

**(2) India**

Defence equipment and technology cooperation with India
is considered an important field of cooperation based on the
special strategic global partnership between Japan and India.
At the Japan-India Summit Meeting in December 2015,
the Agreement between the Government of Japan and the
Government of India concerning the Transfer of Defence
Equipment and Technology[16] was signed. The discussions on
the US-2 amphibian aircraft are underway for cooperation
between the two countries.
Other than the US-2, to form the case of defense
equipment and technology cooperation, including dual
use technologies, the Joint Working Group on Defence
Equipment and Technology Cooperation have been held four
times so far. At the Japan-India Defence Ministerial Meeting
held in September 2017, the ministers agreed to commence
the discussions for research collaboration. In July 2018,
the two countries launched the cooperative research on the
Visual SLAM based GNSS Augmentation Technology for
UGV[17]/Robotics.
As a follow up to the Japan-India Defence Industry
Business Forum that was held in September 2017, people
in the Japanese defense industry visited the Indian national
defense industry of India in August 2018. Progress has been
made in discussions on defense equipment and technology
cooperation between the two countries, including the second
Japan-India Defence Industry Business Forum, which was
held in February 2019.

technology cooperation in non-traditional security sectors,
such as humanitarian assistance, disaster relief, and maritime
security through the Japan-ASEAN Defense Vice-Ministerial
Meetings and other occasions. Participating countries
have expressed their expectation for Japan’s cooperation
in effectively dealing with these issues. In the “Vientiane
Vision” announced by Japan at the ASEAN-Japan Defence
Ministers’ Informal Meeting held in November 2016, it is
stated that Japan’ defense equipment and technological
cooperation with ASEAN countries would be promoted with
a focus on the following three points: (1) equipment and
technology transfer, (2) human resources development, and
(3) holding seminars on defense industries.
As a specific initiative with the Philippines, an official
agreement was made on the transfer of MSDF’s TC90 training aircraft to the Philippine Navy at the JapanPhilippines Summit Meeting in September 2016, and TC-90
pilot training was conducted for pilots from the Philippine
Navy at the MSDF Tokushima Air Base from November of
the same year to March 2018. Since April 2017, maintenance
and repair assistance by dispatched personnel from a Japanese
maintenance company has been provided. Furthermore, two
TC-90 aircraft were transferred to the Philippine Navy in
March 2017, and the remaining three TC-90 aircraft were
transferred in March 2018.
Based on a proposal from the Philippines, regarding the
transfer, it was confirmed at the Japan-Philippines Defence
Ministerial Meeting in June 2018 that parts and maintenance
equipment of the UH-1H utility helicopters that became
unnecessary for the SDF would also be donated. After the
signing of an arrangement between the defense officials
involved in the transfer in November 2018, some components
were delivered to the Philippines in March 2019. These two
transfers were cases of the application of the provision of
the SDF Act enforced in June 2017 that enables the MOD
to grant or transfer the SDF’s equipment which is no longer
used to the governments of developing states for a lower
price than the current price (See Paragraph 3 below).
Further, in January 2019, a framework was established for
regular consultation of the Joint Working Group on Defence
Equipment and Technology Cooperation.
In November 2017, Japan and Thailand agreed to promote
future defense equipment and technology cooperation,
including early conclusion of the agreement concerning the
Transfer of Defense Equipment and Technology.
Between Vietnam, the Terms of Reference (TOR) for
regular consultations concerning defense equipment and
technological cooperation was signed during the JapanVietnam Defense Vice-ministerial Level Meeting in
November 2016.

defense ministers’ meeting in May 2019. In addition, at
the Japan-Vietnam Leaders’ Working Lunch held in July
2019, the leaders agreed on commencing negotiations for an
agreement concerning the transfer of defense equipment and
technology.
Japan and Malaysia signed the Japan-Malaysia
Agreement concerning the Transfer of Defence Equipment
and Technology[18] in April 2018. The MOD will continue
to promote cooperation for humanitarian assistance and
disaster relief as well as the maritime security area through
these initiatives.

See Part III, Chapter 3, Section 1-2-3 (ASEAN Member Countries)


**Chapter**


**(4) Middle East**
In November 2017, the ASDF C-2 transport aircraft, which
was on an overseas flight training, participated in the “Dubai
Air Show 2017,” and the ATLA set up an exhibition booth
relating to the C-2 transport aircraft for the first time.
Upon a request from His Majesty King Abdullah II Ibn
Al Hussein, King of the Hashemite Kingdom of Jordan,
in August 2019, Japan transferred a retired GSDF type61-combat vehicle to Jordan for display at the Royal Tank
Museum. Meanwhile, the King offered to donate an armored
vehicle developed in Jordan to the Japanese GSDF, which
the GSDF received in the same month.

3 Establishment of Regulations on Equipment
Cooperation with Developing Countries


Surrounded by an increasingly severe security environment,
it has become even more important for Japan that the nations
which have a cooperative and friendly relationship with Japan
in terms of security and defense have appropriate capabilities.
It is also critical to develop a foundation that will serve as the


18 Offi i l A t b t th G t f J d th G t f M l i i th T f f D f E i t d T h


-----

basis for the international community to cooperate towards
improving the security environment. Among these friendly
nations, some have diffi culties in acquiring an adequate level
of defense equipment on their own because of their economic
and fi nancial situations. Some of these states are requesting
to use SDF’s equipment which is no longer used. However,
Article 9, Paragraph 1 of the Public Finance Act stipulates
that the Government must receive reasonable consideration
when transferring or leasing any governmental properties
including the SDF’s equipment to other countries. Therefore,
a grant or a transfer for lower price than the current price is
not allowed unless otherwise provided.
Under these circumstances, to respond to the needs of such
friendly nations, a special provision to Article 9, Paragraph 1
of the Public Finance Act[19] was created in the SDF Act and

**4** **Adapting Defense Equipment for Civilian Use**


With regard to aircraft involving many technological bases
shared between the defense and the civilian sectors, the MOD
has been considering the civilian use of aircraft developed
by the MOD from the perspective that taking measures to
contribute to the revitalization of the civilian sector will
contribute to maintaining and activating the industrial
bases of Japanese aircraft, and by extension, to maintaining
and strengthening the defense industrial base in Japan. In
August 2010, the MOD compiled a set of guidelines for the
development of a concrete system for converting aircraft to
civilian use, while in 2011, it also developed an application
procedure for private companies interested in civilian use.


put in force in June 2017. This provision enables the MOD
to grant or transfer the SDF’s equipment which is no longer
used to the governments of developing states for a lower
price than the current price.
Even in the case of granting or transferring equipment
for a lower price than the current price pursuant to this
provision, whether or not to transfer such equipment, and
to which government such equipment to be transferred, will
be determined on a case-by-case basis in light of the Three
Principles on Transfer of Defense Equipment and Technology
and other regulations. In addition, an international agreement
must be concluded between the Governments of Japan and
the recipient countries to prevent extra-purpose use and third
party transfer of the transferred equipment without the prior
consent of Japan.[20]

So far, technical data related to the civilian use of the US-2
amphibian rescue aircraft and the F7-10 engine that are
mounted on P-1 maritime patrol aircraft have been disclosed
in response to requests from the implementing companies. In
December 2016, the ATLA and IHI Corporation, a company
manufacturing the F7-10 engine, signed a contract for the
civilian use of the F7-10 for sales to the Japan Aerospace
Exploration Agency (JAXA) for the fi rst time.
For civilian use of equipment other than aircraft,
procedure rules were prepared in August 2018 towards
project formulation in the future.


**Chapter**


**5** **Participation in International Defense Equipment Exhibitions**


From the viewpoint of promoting defense equipment and
technology cooperation, the ATLA has participated in
international defense equipment exhibitions to introduce
Japan’s defense equipment policies and advanced technology.
These initiatives help foreign government offi cials better
understand Japan’s equipment policies and technology, and
contribute to building bases for the promotion of defense
equipment and technology cooperation.
The ATLA has participated in international defense
equipment exhibitions, such as Eurosatory in France, AUSA
in the United States, and INDO DEFENCE in Indonesia, as
well as the Berlin Air Show 2018 that was held in Germany
in 2018. At these events, the ATLA widely disseminated

In the domestic field, the ATLA participated in Japan
International Aerospace Exhibition 2018 Tokyo held in
Tokyo Big Sight in November of the same year and invited
people involved in national defense from 13 countries,
including Western and Southeast Asian countries, in order
to promote defense equipment and technology cooperation.

**6** **Public-Private Defense Industry Forum**


The Public-Private Defense Industry Forum is held with the
purpose of promoting defense equipment and technology
cooperation with partner countries as a joint effort between
the public and private sectors. This forum is held to deepen
understanding of the relevant parties and facilitate concrete
defense equipment and technology cooperation in the


In June 2019, the ATLA participated in the Paris Air

the P-1 patrol aircraft and the C-2 transport aircraft, both
of which were developed in Japan, the ATLA widely
disseminated information on our nation’s advanced
technology possessed by Japanese manufacturers, which are
symbolized by the domestically produced aircraft. In Japan,
the ATLA participated in the “MAST Asia 2019” held in
Makuhari Messe in June 2019, and exchanged opinions
with people involved in national defense from European and
Southeast Asian countries, promoting defense equipment
and technology cooperation.

future through explanation of various systems surrounding
the defense industry in Japan and each country as well
as presentations by each company on their products and
technology. Most recently, the said forum was held with
Italy in January 2019, and with India in February 2019.


**Chapter**


**7** **Preventing Leakage of Advantageous Technologies for Defense Equipment**


In promoting defense equipment and technology cooperation
internationally, the MOD will work to strengthen (1)
intellectual property management, (2) technology control,
and (3) information security in order to prevent leakage of
advantageous technologies for defense equipment.


See


Section 4-3-2 (4) (b. Preventing Leakage of Advantageous
Technologies)

**Enhancing Intelligence Capabilities**
### 3


**1** **Military Intelligence Collection**


For formulating defense policy accurately in response to the
changes in the situation and for operating defense capabilities
effectively in dealing with various situations, it is necessary to
grasp medium- to long-term military trends in the neighboring
countries of Japan and to detect the indications of various
situations promptly. To this end, the Ministry of Defense
(MOD)/Self-Defense Force (SDF) always makes efforts to
collect information swiftly and accurately by using various
methods.
Examples of intelligence collection means used by the
MOD/SDF include: (1) collecting, processing and analyzing
military communications and signals emanating from
electronic weapons in the air over Japan; (2) collecting,
processing, and analyzing data from various imagery satellites
(including Information Gathering Satellite);[1] (3) surveillance
activities by ships, aircraft and other assets; (4) collecting
and organizing a variety of open source information; (5)

**2** **Initiatives towards Enhancing Intelligence Capabilities**


Under the National Defense Program Guidelines for FY2019
and beyond (NDPG),[2] in order to provide timely and effective
intelligence support to policy decision and SDF operations,
the MOD/SDF will promote initiatives to comprehensively
enhance intelligence capabilities at all stages of intelligence,
including gathering, analyzing, sharing and securing of
information.
Specifi cally, the MOD/SDF will drastically strengthen
information gathering and analysis capabilities so that
the MOD/SDF will be fully capable of meeting various
intelligence requirements including those related to new
domains. This will be conducted by strengthening gathering
postures for SIGINT and IMINT through establishing and
enhancing capabilities of information collection facilities,
utilizing Information Gathering Satellites and commercial


information exchanges with defense organizations of other
nations; and (6) intelligence collection conducted by defense
attachés and other offi cials.
Additional attachés were dispatched to Belgium, where
the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) and the
European Union (EU) are headquartered, in February 2019
in view of the importance of ensuring continued robust
collaboration, cooperation and mutual security arrangements
with Europe. In March 2019, a new dispatch was made
to Chile in view of the importance of collecting strategic
information in Pacifi c Rim countries. Additional attachés are
also dispatched to Malaysia, a country located on key sea
lanes and with which Japan is increasingly engaged across a
range of fi elds from military exchange to capacity building
support, defense equipment and technology cooperation.

See Fig.VI-3-1 (Dispatched Defense Attachés)

satellites, and diversifying means for information collection
through new equipment such as long-endurance Unmanned
Aircraft Vehicles (UAVs). Furthermore, the MOD/SDF will
also strengthen the gathering posture of HUMINT through
enhancing its defense attaché system, reinforce the gathering
posture of OSINT and expand its cooperation with allied
countries.
In this regard, the MOD/SDF will proactively utilize the
latest information processing technology, promote all-source
analysis by fusing a wide variety of information sources
together, and successfully develop and connect systems that
will promote information sharing.[3]

In order to respond appropriately to increasingly diversifi ed
intelligence requirements, the MOD/SDF will promote the
securing and training of highly capable personnel handling


**Chapter**


Information Gathering Satellite (IGS) of the Japanese government is operated by the Cabinet Satellite Intelligence Center. The MOD, along with other ministries and agencies, utilizes the
imagery intelligence provided by the IGS.

**Interaction with Local Communities and**
**Japanese Citizens**
### 4


Various activities of the Ministry of Defense (MOD)/SelfDefense Forces (SDF) are hard to implement without the
understanding and cooperation of each and every person

**Section**
**1** **Collaboration with Local Communities**


The National Defense Program Guidelines for FY2019 and
beyond (NDPG) provides that, in recent years, training and
exercises of SDF and U.S. forces in Japan are becoming
more diverse and defense equipment more sophisticated,
and that, as a result, it is becoming all the more important to
gain understanding among and secure cooperation from local
governments and residents around defense facilities.


and local governments. Therefore it is necessary to further
deepen the trust between local communities and people, and
the SDF.

Therefore, the NDPG provides that the MOD/SDF will
constantly and actively engage in public relations activities
regarding defense policies and activities, and that, upon fi elding
units and equipment of SDF or U.S. Forces in Japan and
conducting training and exercises, the MOD/SDF will make
careful, detailed coordination to meet the desires and conditions
of local communities, while suffi ciently fulfi lling accountability.


**Chapter**


**1** **Supporting Civilian Life**


The MOD/SDF conduct activities to support the lives of
citizens in a range of fi elds, in response to requests from local
governments and relevant organizations. Such activities
contribute to further deepening the trust in the SDF, and

The GSDF handles the disposal of unexploded ordnance
and other dangerous explosives found throughout Japan. In
FY2018, there were approx. 1,480 such cases (approx. 53.0
tons). In particular, cases handled in Okinawa Prefecture
accounted for approx. 38% of the total cases. The MSDF
clears and disposes of underwater mines and other dangerous
explosives, and approx. 4,456 explosives (approx. 2.8 tons)
were handled in FY2018.

to their facilities to the extent that it does not interfere with unit
activities, thus striving to foster friendly interaction with local
communities. The SDF also provides transportation and other
assistance at a variety of athletic events. In addition, it supports
regional medical treatment efforts by providing general
medical care at some SDF hospitals as well as conducting
urgent transport for emergency patients from isolated islands.
Furthermore, based on national policy,[1] the MOD/SDF ensures
opportunities for local small and medium sized enterprises to
receive orders, while taking effi ciency into account, by such
measures as the promotion of separated/divided ordering[2] and
the securing of competition amongst companies within the
same qualify cation and grade divisions.[3]

**(2) Support for and Cooperation with SDF Activities**

The SDF camps and bases maintain close relations with local
communities, and therefore, various forms of support and
cooperation from the local community are indispensable for
the SDF to conduct its diverse activities, including education


and training, and disaster relief. Moreover, units dispatched
overseas for international peace cooperation operations and
other duties receive support and cooperation from the relevant
organizations for the procedures involved.
The MOD/SDF are further strengthening cooperation
with relevant entities such as local governments, police and
fire services in order to ensure immediate and sure activities
by the SDF in various contingencies.

**Making a Connection with the Local Community**

**Betsukai Town, Hokkaido**
Located on the eastern edge of Japan, Betsukai Town extends over a vast 1,300 km[2] of land abundant in nature. Dairy farming and fishery
are the town’ main industries. The residents of the town are keenly aware of the importance and necessity of the nation to protect the
lives and assets of its people, due to the town’s close proximity to Kunashiri Island, which is one of Japan’s northern territories in dispute
and is only 1.6 km away.
Betsukai Town hosts two SDF-related facilities: the Yausubetsu ManeuverArea, the largest facility of this kind in Japan, and GSDF
Camp Betsukai, which manages and operates the training area. SDF troops staying in the camp actively participate in local activities
held by the town.
In 1997, the Yausubetsu Maneuver Area accepted relocation of live fire drills by the U.S. forces across Prefectural Route 104 in
Okinawa. This training area was the first Japanese facility to accept such relocation in an effort to ease the military impact on the people
of Okinawa. The residents of Betsukai Town at that time commented that reducing the impact on Okinawa as much as possible was the
responsibility of Japanese citizens and they wanted to be helpful on this matter.
Since then, military drills have been held every year in the Yausubetsu Maneuver Area not only by the U.S. forces but also by SDF
units from all around Japan. Every time military units come to the town, the “SDF support group of Betsukai Town,” consisting of
town resident volunteers, hosts an exchange meeting to create an opportunity for local people and SDF troops to deepen friendships and
strengthen ties between them.
Betsukai Town will continue to support SDF troops engaged in national defense through the spirit of public-private partnership.

**Higashimatsushima City, Miyagi Prefecture**
Situated in the central coastal region of Miyagi Prefecture, Higashimatsushima City is about a one-hour drive from Sendai. The city is
rich in nature and surrounded by two shades of blue: the sea encircling Okumatsushima, and the clear sky.
After ASDF Matsushima Air Base in the city was damaged by the Great East Japan Earthquake, the ASDF’s Blue Impulse aerobatic
demonstration team and 21st Fighter Training Squadron (F-2 fighters) had been practicing at other bases. More recently, the teams have
returned to the home air base, resuming training flights above the city’s urban area and other tasks related to national defense.
Although Higashimatsushima City has to deal with some land use restrictions due to the existence of the air base on its premises,
the Special Defense Facilities Environs Improvement Adjustment Giantsare available for the city to effectively improve municipal
roads and develop the local community. The city also works to develop a good relationship between the air base and the local residents
by communicating base-related information to them. In addition, the city has been using grants for improvement of facilities vital to
people’s livelihoods in order to reconstruct a rest facility in Yamoto-kaihin-ryokuchi Park (Yamoto seashore green park), which will be


-----

completed this year, and a building for the Fire and Disaster Management Agency, which is scheduled to be completed next year. These
facilities were severely damaged by the great earthquake and we have long waited for their reconstruction.
Since I became mayor, my goal has been to support the coexistence and mutual prosperity of the local community and Matsushima
Air Base. This air base is set to be the first Japanese destination at which the torch for the 2020 Tokyo Olympics and Paralympics will
arrive. We hope to invite many local residents to the ceremony to celebrate this occasion and are currently making necessary requests to
relevant ministries and agencies.
In order for the air base and the city to be able to continue sharing prosperity, we will strive to build mutual trust between the base,
the city, and the local residents.

**Sasebo City, Nagasaki Prefecture**
Sasebo City, with a population of about 250,000, is an administratively determined “core city” (i.e., mid-sized city) situated in the north
of Nagasaki Prefecture. The city is home to such facilities as MSDF Sasebo District Headquarters, GSDF Camp Ainoura, and U.S. Navy
Sasebo Base.
Sasebo Naval District began operation and the modern Sasebo Port was opened 130 years ago in 1889. Sasebo City developed rapidly
as the home of naval forces and built up mutual trust with the MSDF and GSDF after World War II.
The city’s relationship with the SDF has been becoming even stronger in recent years through such developments as the launch of
the GSDF Amphibious Rapid Deployment Brigade in March 2018, the inauguration of the Sakibe Subcamp in March 2019—the site for
the deployment of an amphibious vehicle unit—and the formulation of specific port use plans by the MSDF, including the construction
of a long stretch of quay walls.
We are currently working to promote reemployment of retired SDF personnel to revitalize local industry under Sasebo City’s
comprehensive strategy for overcoming population decline and vitalizing local economy. We have established the Sasebo City liaison
committee for promoting re-employment of retired SDF personnel, consisting of the SDF, the chamber of commerce and industry,
economic organizations, and the local governments. The committee is regularly meeting to discuss this subject from various perspectives,
such as life quality and welfare, through collaboration between the public and private sectors.
We will continue making our utmost effort to create environments favorable to SDF personnel by developing a city conducive to
harmonious coexistence between the SDF and the local community, enhancing SDF facilities vital to national defense, and ensuring
adequate life quality for SDF personnel and their families.

1 Scale and Features of Defense Facilities


The uses of defense facilities are diverse, and they often
require large volumes of land. In addition, as of January
1, 2019, approx. 28% of the land area of the facilities and
areas (for exclusive use) of the U.S. Forces in Japan is jointly
used by the SDF in accordance with the Japan-U.S. Status of
Forces Agreement, with the purpose to enhance the diversity
and efficiency of Japan-U.S. bilateral training and exercises.
Meanwhile, problems related to restricted establishment
and operations of defense facilities have emerged due to the
urbanization of areas around many of the defense facilities.
Also, another problem is that frequent aircraft operations

through sports and music.
Furthermore, Regional Defense Bureaus provide
necessary explanations and conduct coordination for relevant
local governments when implementing the realignment of
the U.S. Forces, the reorganization of SDF units, deployment
of equipment, and training. They also conduct the necessary
liaison and coordination in the event of incidents and
accidents, or any other emergency situation, such as major
earthquakes.

＊ Newly added due to the partial revision of the Act on Improvement of Living Environment of Areas Around Defense Facilities (effective as of April 27, 2011)


and stable utilization by ensuring harmony between the
defense facilities and the surrounding areas as well as
obtaining the understanding and cooperation of the local
residents.
For that purpose, the MOD has taken measures to
prevent, reduce or mitigate aircraft noise and other impacts
caused by activities of the SDF or the U.S. Forces, or by
the establishment/operation of airport and other defense
facilities in the surrounding area since 1974 based on the Act
on Improvement of Living Environment of Areas Around
Defense Facilities (Living Environment Improvement Act).
Taking into consideration the requests from the relevant
local governments, the MOD partially revised the Living
Environment Improvement Act in 2011, and conducted a
review to enable the Specified Defense Facilities Environs
Improvement Adjustment Grants to be applied to so-called
soft projects, such as aid for medical expenses. In addition,
the MOD added defense facilities to be eligible for these
grants. Focused work is also underway to provide sound
insulation at residences.

-----

flying over Miyazaki Prefecture and temporarily reduced the
eyesight of a co-pilot. Starting from around the same month,
incidents of laser irradiation aimed at U.S. Forces aircraft
have occurred frequently around Yokota Air Base as well.
These are extremely dangerous and malicious acts that may
disrupt a pilot’s ability to operate aircraft and result in a
catastrophe such as a crash. Therefore, the MOD disseminates
information regarding the risks involved in these acts to local
residents by putting up posters and requests their cooperation
in reporting to the police while closely cooperating with
relevant local governments. Additionally, the Ordinance for
Enforcement of the Civil Aeronautics Act was revised in
December 2016, making these interference acts subject to
regulation as well as fines and other penalties.


2 Response to Small Unmanned Aircraft Flying over
Defense Facilities and Surrounding Airspace


In recent years there have been terror attacks overseas
including attempted ones using unmanned aircraft systems,
including commercial drones, some of which are targeted at
military facilities. Given such a situation, there is a concern
that drone terror attacks on the SDF facilities or the facilities/
area of the U.S. Forces Japan (USFJ) can also happen in
Japan, which will pose a serious threat to the function of
military installations for defending Japan. To address such
a concern, the Act on Prohibition of Flight of UASs around
and over Key Facilities was enforced on June 13, 2019, to
prohibit small unmanned aircraft from flying over the SDF
facilities and the facilities and area of the USFJ designated
by the Minister of Defense. On the same day, the Minister
of Defense designated 13 SDF facilities where major SDF
Headquarters are located.


**Chapter**


**Initiatives taken by local authorities in the vicinity of defense facilities**

It is imperative to gain cooperation from related local authorities in order to achieve harmony between defense facilities
and nearby areas.
Local authorities in the vicinity of defense facilities conduct initiatives to improve the local living environments utilizing
assistance projects funded by the Ministry of Defense to address obstacles resulting from the presence of defense facilities,
thereby ensuring the stability of the lives of local residents and the enhancement of their welfare.
For example, in cases where training sites, airfields, and other facilities affect the lives of local residents, local authorities
construct gymnasiums and other venues to facilitate evacuations of residents using the national subsidy.
In addition, schools, hospitals and other facilities that require quiet environments are outfitted with noise insulation
features that prevent and alleviate noise generated by the takeoff and landing of aircraft at airfields used by the SDF and
U.S. Forces stationed in Japan and other activities.

**1** **Various Public Relations Activities**


As the activities of the MOD/SDF cannot be carried out
without the understanding and support of the Japanese
people, it is important to be proactive in undertaking easily
comprehensible public relations activities and to gain the
trust and cooperation of the public.
According to a “Public Opinion Survey on the SelfDefense Forces and Defense Issues” conducted by the
Cabinet Office (in January 2018), public expectations
and evaluations towards the SDF have been increasing
as the scope of MOD/SDF activities has expanded both
domestically and internationally. In light of this result, the
MOD/SDF will continue to conduct a variety of PR activities,
thereby striving to ensure better understanding of the current
status of the MOD/SDF.
In addition, given that understanding and support from
foreign countries are also of utmost importance for the SDF
to conduct its missions successfully, it is essential that the
MOD strengthens efforts to provide information to foreign
countries about MOD/SDF initiatives, including about SDF
activities abroad.


English, and improving the contents of the MOD’s English
website. It is proactively transmitting information to the
international community through efforts such as providing
international media with opportunities for press coverage,
publishing English versions of the defense white paper and
brochures, as well as producing PR videos.

2 Events and PR Facilities


The MOD/SDF conducts activities to widely inform nationals of
the current circumstances of the SDF. These activities include the
GSDF Fuji Fire Power Exercise, cruises to experience Maritime
Self-Defense Force (MSDF) vessels, and demonstration flights
and boarding experiences on aircraft. In addition, at camps
and bases throughout the country, events including equipment
exhibitions and unit tours are held on occasions such as the
anniversary of a unit’s foundation. In some instances, they also
hold parades throughout the cities, with cooperation from the
local communities. Furthermore, as part of the commemoration
of the SDF anniversary, the SDF Marching Festival is held
at Nippon Budokan arena every year. The festival attracted
approximately 41,000 visitors in total in 2018.
Concerning annual reviews by the SDF, a troop review,
a fleet review, and an air review are hosted in rotation by
the GSDF, MSDF, and Air Self-Defense Force (ASDF)
respectively. In 2018, a troop review was held by the GSDF
at Asaka Training Area. About 4,000 uniformed GSDF,
MSDF and ASDF personnel with about 260 vehicles and
about 40 aircraft participated in the review and showed the

entities: public records are not possessions of national public
employees but are intellectual resources to be shared by
the people in supporting the basis of sound democracy, and
preparation and preservation are not auxiliary but rather an
essential business of national public employees.


1 Necessity of Proper Management of

The issue of daily reports in South Sudan started from
an inappropriate response to a disclosure request, followed
by further inappropriate responses and explanations seeking
consistency without thoroughly examining the issue, making
the matters worse. The issue of daily reports in Iraq occurred
due to multiple factors, including a lack of or insufficient
basic actions such as the following: delivery of orders/
instructions, coordination among relevant departments for
the execution thereof, and submission of proper reports to
the senior officers and leaders.
In order to regain the public’s confidence by reforming
the awareness of personnel and the organization culture, the
MOD/SDF is making full efforts to prevent recurrence based

2 Necessity of Appropriate Operation of the
Information Disclosure System


Democracy is founded on the principle that the public has
access to accurate information, thereby making appropriate
judgment and exercise of sovereignty. Administrative
documents held by the government are of the utmost
importance for the public’s access to accurate information,
and it is an important responsibility for the government
to manage them in an appropriate manner and respond
to the public’s information disclosure requests properly.
Information held by the MOD/SDF is no exception to this,
the MOD/SDF bears this important responsibility under
the Act on Access to Information Held by Administrative
Organs.

their recurrence was a pressing issue. To address the issue the meeting decided to assign a Chief Record Officer (CRO) to
each ministry/agency in order to strengthen their governance. In response, the MOD assigned a CRO in April 2019.
The CRO is effectively responsible for the management of the MOD’s administrative documents and information
disclosure, and provides: necessary instructions and coordination for inspection/audits concerning document management
and necessary improvements based on their results; measures to foster a sense of compliance concerning document
management; and affairs concerning information disclosure closely related to document management and protection of
personal information. In addition, an official document management office is set up to assist the CRO.
Under the new system, the MOD will strengthen efforts to ensure proper management of official documents, including
personnel education on compliance with document management and other rules and viable checking of document
management.

**Reference 5 National Security Strategy (Outline)**

(Approved by the National Security Council
and the Cabinet on December 17, 2013)
**I. Purpose**
❍ As Japan’s security environment becomes ever more severe, Japan
needs to identify its national interests from a long-term perspective,
determine the course it should pursue in the international community,
and adopt a whole-government approach for national security policies
and measures in order to continue developing a prosperous and peaceful
society.
❍ In a world where globalization continues, Japan should play an even
more proactive role as a major global player in the international
community.
❍ The Strategy, as fundamental policies pertaining to national security,
presents guidelines for policies in areas related to national security.
❍ With the National Security Council (NSC) serving as the control
tower, as well as with strong political leadership, the Government of
Japan will implement national security policies in a more strategic and
structured manner through a whole-government approach.
❍ When implementing policies in other areas, the Government of Japan
will give due consideration to national security so that Japan can utilize
its strengths, such as its diplomatic ability and defense capability, in a
smooth and fully-functional way as a whole, based on the Strategy.
❍ The Strategy will guide Japan’s national security policy over the next
decade. Through the implementation of concrete policies, the NSC will
regularly carry out systematic evaluation and upgrade the Strategy in a
timely and appropriate manner.
**II. Fundamental Principle of National Security**
1. Principles Japan Upholds
❍ Japan is a country with rich culture and tradition, and upholds universal
values, such as freedom, democracy, respect for fundamental human
rights and the rule of law. Japan has a wealth of highly educated human
capital and high cultural standards, and is an economic power with
strong economic capacity and high technological capabilities. Japan
has achieved its development benefiting from an open international
economic system. In addition, Japan as a maritime state has pursued
“Open and Stable Seas.”
❍ Japan has consistently followed the path of a peace-loving nation
since the end of World War II, and has adhered to a basic policy of
maintaining an exclusively national defense-oriented policy, not
becoming a military power that poses a threat to other countries, and
observing the Three Non-Nuclear Principles.
❍ Japan has maintained its security, and contributed to peace and stability
in the Asia-Pacific region, by enhancing its alliance with the United
States (U.S.), as well as by deepening cooperative relationships with
other countries. Japan has also contributed to the realization of stability
and prosperity in the international community through initiatives
for supporting the economic growth of developing countries and for
addressing global issues based on the principle of human security, as
well as through trade and investment relations with other countries.
❍ Complying with the United Nations (U.N.) Charter, Japan has been
cooperating with the U.N. and other international organizations, and
has actively contributed to their activities. Japan has also continuously
participated in international peace cooperation activities. In addition, as
the only country to have ever suffered atomic bombings in war, Japan
has consistently engaged in disarmament and non-proliferation efforts,
playing a leading role in international initiatives to realize “a world free
of nuclear weapons.”
❍ Japan will continue to adhere to the course that it has taken to date


economy, contribute even more proactively in securing peace, stability,
and prosperity of the international community, while achieving its own
security as well as peace and stability in the Asia-Pacific region, as a
“Proactive Contributor to Peace” based on the principle of international
cooperation. This is the fundamental principle of national security that
Japan should stand to hold.
2. Japan’s National Interests and National Security Objectives
National Interests
❍ To maintain its sovereignty and independence; to defend its territorial
integrity; to ensure the safety of life, person, and properties of its
nationals, and to ensure its survival while maintaining its own peace
and security and preserving its rich culture and tradition.
❍ To achieve the prosperity of Japan and its nationals through economic
development, thereby consolidating its peace and security (to this end,
it is essential that Japan strengthens the free trade regime and realizes
an international environment that offers stability, transparency and
predictability).
❍ To maintain and protect international order based on rules and universal
values, such as freedom, democracy, respect for fundamental human
rights, and the rule of law.
National Security Objectives
❍ To strengthen the deterrence necessary for maintaining Japan’s peace
and security and for ensuring its survival, thus deterring threats from
directly reaching Japan; at the same time, if by any chance a threat
should reach Japan, to defeat such threat and to minimize the damage.
❍ To improve the security environment of the Asia-Pacific region,
and prevent the emergence of and reduce direct threats to Japan,
through strengthening the Japan-U.S. Alliance, enhancing the trust
and cooperative relationships between Japan and its partners within
and outside the Asia-Pacific region, and promoting practical security
cooperation.
❍ To improve the global security environment and build a peaceful,
stable, and prosperous international community by strengthening the
international order based on universal values and rules, and by playing a
leading role in the settlement of disputes, through consistent diplomatic
efforts and further personnel contributions.
**III. Security Environment Surrounding Japan and National Security Challenges**
1. Global Security Environment and Challenges
(1) Shift in the Balance of Power and Rapid Progress of Technological
Innovation
❍ The balance of power between nations is changing due to the rise
of emerging countries (e.g., China and India). In particular, China
is increasing its presence in the international community. The
United States, which has the world’s largest power as a whole, has
manifested its policy to shift its emphasis of national security and
economic policy towards the Asia-Pacific region.
❍ The rapid advancement of globalization and technological innovation
has increased the relative influence of non-state actors, and the threat
of terrorism and crimes committed by non-state actors is expanding.
(2) Threat of the Proliferation of Weapons of Mass Destruction and Other
Related Materials
❍ The issue of the transfer, proliferation, and performance improvement
of weapons of mass destruction (WMD) and their means of delivery,
such as ballistic missiles, the issue of nuclear and missile development
by North Korea, and the nuclear issue of Iran remain major threats to
Japan and the international community.
(3) Threat of International Terrorism
❍ International terrorism has spread and become diverse in its forms
due to the advancement of globalization.
❍ Terrorist attacks against Japanese nationals and interests have


-----

actually taken place overseas. Japan and its people face the threat of
international terrorism both at home and abroad.
(4) Risks to Global Commons
❍ In recent years, risks that can impede the utilization of and free access
to global commons, such as the sea, outer space, and cyberspace, have
been spreading and become more serious.
❍ In the seas, in recent years, there have been an increasing number
of cases of unilateral actions in an attempt to change the status quo
by coercion with respect to natural resources and the security of
respective states.
❍ Due to these cases as well as piracy and other issues, there is a
growing risk of the stability of sea lanes and freedom of navigation
coming under threat.
❍ There exist risks that could impede the continuous and stable use of
outer space, including an increasing amount of space debris caused
by satellite collisions amongst others.
❍ Risks of cyber-attacks with the intent to disrupt critical infrastructure
and obstruct military systems are becoming more serious.
(5) Challenges to Human Security
❍ Global issues that cannot be dealt with by a single country—namely,
poverty, widening inequality, global health challenges including
infectious diseases, climate change and other environmental issues,
food security, and humanitarian crises caused by civil wars and
natural disasters—are emerging as critical and urgent issues of human
security, threatening the very survival and dignity of individuals.
❍ These challenges could have repercussions on peace and stability of
the international community.
(6) The Global Economy and Its Risks
❍ The risk of the expansion of an economic crisis from one country to
the entire global economy is growing.
❍ Signs of protectionism and reluctance towards the creation of new
trade rules are becoming apparent.
❍ The rise of resource nationalism in resource rich countries as well as
an intensified competition for the acquisition of energy and mineral
resources by emerging countries are observed.
2. Security Environment and Challenges in the Asia-Pacific Region
(1) Characteristics of the Strategic Environment of the Asia-Pacific Region
❍ The region has various political regimes and a host of countries with
large-scale military forces including nuclear-weapon states. Yet a
regional cooperation framework in the security realm has not been
sufficiently institutionalized.
(2) North Korea’s Military Buildup and Provocative Actions
❍ North Korea has enhanced the capability of WMDs including nuclear
weapons and that of ballistic missiles. At the same time, North Korea
has repeatedly taken provocative military actions including the use
of provocative rhetoric against Japan and other countries, thereby
increasing the tension in the region. The threat to the security of Japan
and of other countries is being substantially aggravated.
❍ As Kim Jong-un proceeds to consolidate his regime, the domestic
situation in North Korea needs to be closely monitored.
❍ North Korea’s abduction is a grave issue affecting Japan’s sovereignty
as well as the lives and safety of Japanese nationals. It is an urgent
issue for the Government of Japan to resolve under its responsibility.
(3) China’s Rapid Rise and Intensified Activities in Various Areas
❍ There is an expectation for China to share and comply with
international norms, and play a more active and cooperative role for
regional and global issues.
❍ China has been rapidly advancing its military capabilities in a wide
range of areas without sufficient transparency.
❍ China has taken actions that can be regarded as attempts to change
the status quo by coercion based on their own assertions, which
are incompatible with the existing order of international law, in the
maritime and aerial domains, including the East China Sea and the
South China Sea (e.g., intrusion into Japan’s territorial waters and
airspace around the Senkaku Islands, establishment of its own “Air
Defense Identification Zone”).
❍ The cross-strait relationship has deepened economically. Meanwhile,
the military balance has been changing. Thus, the relationship
contains both orientations towards stability and potential instability.
**IV. Japan’s Strategic Approaches to National Security**
1. Strengthening and Expanding Japan’s Capabilities and Roles

-  To ensure national security, Japan needs to first and foremost strengthen
its own capabilities and the foundation for exercising those capabilities.
Japan must also steadily fulfill the role it should play and adapt its
capabilities to respond to future developments.

-  Enhancing Japan’s resilience in national security, through reinforcing its
diplomatic power and defense force, as well as bolstering its economic
strengths and technological capabilities, contributes to peace and stability
in the Asia-Pacific region and the international community at large.

-  In order to overcome national security challenges and achieve national
security objectives, as well as to proactively contribute to peace in


cooperation with the international community, Japan needs to expand
and deepen cooperative relationships with other countries, with the
Japan-U.S. Alliance as the cornerstone. At the same time, Japan
needs to make effective use of its diverse resources and promote
comprehensive policies.
(1) Strengthening Diplomacy for Creating a Stable International
Environment
❍ The key of national security is to create a stable and predictable
international environment, and prevent the emergence of threats.
❍ It is necessary for Japan to realize an international order and security
environment that are desirable for Japan, by playing an even more
proactive role in achieving peace and stability of the international
community as a “Proactive Contributor to Peace” based on the
principle of international cooperation.
❍ It is necessary to enhance diplomatic creativity and negotiating
power to deepen the understanding of and garner support for Japan’s
position in the international community.
❍ By highlighting Japan’s attractiveness, Japan needs to strengthen its
soft power that would benefit the international community. Japan also
needs to strengthen its capacity to promptly and accurately identify
the needs of Japanese nationals and firms to support their overseas
activities.
❍ Japan will make even more proactive contributions to international

which plays a central role in these efforts, Japan will enhance its
defense structure for deterrence and response to various situations,
prioritizing important functions from a joint and comprehensive
perspective.
❍ With regard to the threat of nuclear weapons, the extended deterrence
of the U.S. with nuclear deterrence at its core is indispensable. In order

**Reference 6 NATIONAL DEFENSE PROGRAM GUIDELINES for FY2019 and**
**beyond**


(December 18, 2018)
**I. NDPG’s Objective**
Japan since the end of World War II has consistently treaded the path of a
peace- loving nation. This has been accomplished by the persistent efforts of
our forerunners under the principle of maintaining peace.
The most consequential responsibility of the Government of Japan is
to maintain Japan’s peace and security, to ensure its survival and to defend
to the end Japanese nationals’ life, person and property of its nationals and
territorial land, waters and airspace. This is the foremost responsibility that
Japan must fulfill as a sovereign nation. Carrying out this responsibility by
exerting efforts on its own accord and initiative is at the very heart of Japan’s
national security. Japan’s defense capability is the ultimate guarantor of its
security and the clear representation of the unwavering will and ability of
Japan as a peace-loving nation. And maintaining Japan’s peace and security
is an essential premise for its prosperity.
At present, security environment surrounding Japan is changing at
extremely high speeds. Changes in the balance of power in the international
arena are accelerating and becoming more complex, and uncertainty over the
existing order is increasing. In addition, rapid expansion in the use of new
domains, which are space, cyberspace and electromagnetic spectrum is poised
to fundamentally change the existing paradigm of national security, which
has prioritized responses in traditional, physical domains, which are land, sea
and air.
Even under these circumstances, Japan will vigorously march forward
as a peace- loving nation. To do so, Japan, amid the dramatically changing
security environment, needs to fundamentally strengthen its national defense
architecture with which to protect, by exerting efforts on its own accord and
initiative, life, person and property of its nationals, territorial land, waters
and airspace, and its sovereignty and independence, thereby expanding roles
Japan can fulfill. Today, no country can preserve its security by itself alone.
Strengthening the Japan-U.S. Alliance as well as security cooperation with
other countries are critical to Japan’s national security, and this cannot be
achieved without Japan's own efforts. The international community also
expects Japan to play roles that are commensurate with its national power.
In strengthening its defense capability, Japan must squarely face
the aforementioned realities of national security and ensure necessary


-----

and sufficient quality and quantity so as to build a truly effective defense
capability that does not lie on a linear extension of the past. In particular, it
has become essential that Japan achieve superiority in new domains, which
are space, cyberspace and electromagnetic spectrum. To build a new defense
capability that combines strengths across all domains, Japan needs to engage
in a transformation at a pace that is fundamentally different from the past,
completely shedding the thinking that relies on traditional division among
land, sea, and air. On the other hand, given the rapidly aging population with
declining birthrates and severe fiscal situation, Japan cannot strengthen its
defense capability without thorough rationalization that does not dwell on
the past.
The Japan-U.S. Alliance, together with Japan's own defense architecture,
continues to be the cornerstone of Japan’s national security. As stated above,
Japan's fulfillment of its foremost responsibility as a sovereign nation is the
very way to fulfill its roles under the Japan-U.S. Alliance and further enhance
the Alliance’s ability to deter and counter threats, and is a foundation upon
which to strategically promote security cooperation in line with the vision of
free and open Indo-Pacific.
Based on the foregoing thoughts, the Government, in line with “On
National Security Strategy” (approved by the National Security Council and
the Cabinet on December 17, 2013, and hereinafter referred to as “National
Security Strategy”), hereby sets forth the “National Defense Program
Guidelines for FY 2019 and beyond” as the new guidelines regarding how
Japan’s national defense ought to be to form the foundation of Japan’s future.

**II. Security Environment Surrounding Japan**
1. Characteristics of current security environment
In the international community, interdependency among countries further
expands and deepens. On the other hand, thanks to further growth of national
power of such countries as China, changes in the balance of power are
accelerating and becoming more complex, thereby increasing uncertainty
over the existing order. Against such a backdrop, prominently emerging are
inter-state competitions across the political, economic and military realms, in
which states seek to shape global and regional order to their advantage as well
as to increase their influence.
These inter-state competitions occur on a continuous basis: In conducting
inter- state competitions, states leverage various means such as undermining
other country’s sovereignty using military and law-enforcement entities, and
manipulating foreign country’s public opinion by exploiting social media.
Also, the so-called gray-zone situations are becoming persistent over a long
period of time, playing out as part of inter- state competitions. They may
possibly further increase and expand.
Such gray-zone situations harbor the risk of rapidly developing into graver
situations without showing clear indications. In addition, methods employed
to alter the status quo, such as “hybrid warfare,” that intentionally blur the
boundaries between the military and non-military realms are forcing affected
actors to take complex measures not limited to military ones.
Driven by rapid technological innovation in information &
communications and other fields, military technologies are showing
remarkable advances. Against the backdrop of such technological advances,
contemporary warfare increasingly features capabilities combined across all
domains: not only land, sea and air but also new domains, which are space,
cyberspace and electromagnetic spectrum. Aiming to improve overall military
capability, states are seeking to gain superiority in technologies that undergird
capabilities in new domains. Since space and cyber domains are widely used
for civilian purposes, if stable use of these domains is impeded, it may entail
serious consequences for the safety of state and its citizens.
Due to advances in military technologies, a variety of threats can now
easily penetrate national borders. States endeavor to develop weapons that
leverage cutting-edge, potentially game-changing technologies. They also
engage in research of autonomous unmanned weapon systems equipped with
artificial intelligence (AI). Further technological innovations hereafter are
expected to make it difficult still to foresee future warfare.
In the international community, there is a broadening and diversifying
array of security challenges that cannot be dealt with by a single country
alone. With respect to space and cyber domains, establishing international
rules and norms has been a security agenda. In maritime domain, there
have been cases where country unilaterally claims its entitlements or take
actions based on its own assertions that are incompatible with existing
international order. These have generated undue infringement upon freedom
in high seas. In addition, the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction
including nuclear, biological and chemical weapons, and ballistic missiles
as well as worsening international terrorism remain grave challenges for the
international community.
Against such background, qualitatively and quantitatively superior
military powers concentrate in Japan’s surroundings where clear trends are
observed in further military build-up and increase in military activities.

2. Situations by country and region
While remaining to possess the world’s largest comprehensive national
power, the United States, with inter-state competitions in a range of areas
prominently emerging, has acknowledged that particularly important
challenge is strategic competition with China and Russia who attempt to alter


global and regional order.
To rebuild its military power, the United States is engaged in such efforts
as maintaining military advantage in all domains through technological
innovations, enhancing nuclear deterrent, and advancing missile defense
capabilities. The United States upholds defense commitments to allies and
partners and maintains forward force presence, while calling on them to share
greater responsibility. The United States frames the Indo-Pacific as a priority
region where it adopts a policy of strengthening alliances and partnerships.
Member states of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO)
including the United States are reviewing their strategies to deal with coercive
attempts to alter the status-quo as well as “hybrid warfare.” In view of changes
in the security environment, NATO member states have been increasing their
defense expenditures.
With an aim to build “world-class forces” by the mid-21st century, China
has sustained high-level growth of defense expenditures with continued
lack of transparency. China has engaged in broad, rapid improvement of its
military power in qualitative and quantitative terms with focus on nuclear,
missile, naval and air forces. In so doing, China attaches importance to
ensuring superiority in new domains: it is rapidly advancing capabilities
in cyber and electromagnetic domains with which to disrupt opponent’s
command and control; and continues to enhance space domain capabilities
through developing and experimenting anti-satellite weapons. China is also
improving missile defense penetration capabilities and amphibious landing
capabilities. Such capability enhancement serves to improve the so-called
Anti-Access/Area Denial (“A2/AD”) capabilities—capabilities to deny access
and deployment of foreign militaries to one’s surrounding areas and to disrupt
their military operations therein—as well as to build capabilities with which
to conduct military operations over greater distances. In addition, China is
promoting civil-military integration policy in areas of national defense,
science & technology and industry, and actively developing and acquiring
cutting-edge technologies of potential military utility. Also, maritime law
enforcement agencies and the military are improving their collaboration.
China engages in unilateral, coercive attempts to alter the status quo based
on its own assertions that are incompatible with existing international order.
In the East China Sea and other waters, China is expanding and intensifying
its military activities at sea and in the air. Around the Senkaku Islands, an
inherent part of Japanese territory, Chinese government vessels continually
violate Japanese territorial waters despite Japan’s strong protests while
Chinese naval ships continuously operate in waters around the Islands. China
is also expanding its military activities in the Pacific Ocean and the Sea
of Japan. In particular, the Chinese military in recent years has frequently
advanced to the Pacific, with its navigation routes and unit composition
becoming more diverse. In the South China Sea, China has forcibly conducted
large-scale, rapid reclamation of maritime features, which are being converted
into military foothold. China in the South China Sea is also expanding and
intensifying its maritime and air activities.
Such Chinese military and other developments, coupled with the lack of
transparency surrounding its defense policy and military power, represent
a serious security concern for the region including Japan and for the
international community. Japan needs to continue to pay utmost attention to
these developments. China is eagerly expected to play active roles in a more
cooperative manner in the region and the international community.
North Korea in recent years has launched ballistic missiles at unprecedented
frequency, rapidly improving its operational capabilities such as simultaneous
launch and surprise attack. Given technological maturity obtained through a
series of nuclear tests, North Korea is assessed to have already successfully
miniaturized nuclear weapons to fit ballistic missile warheads. Although North
Korea expressed its intention for complete denuclearization of the Korean
Peninsula and blew up in public its nuclear test site, it has not carried out the
dismantlement of all weapons of mass destruction and ballistic missiles of all
ranges in a complete, verifiable and irreversible manner: There has been no
essential change in North Korea’s nuclear and missile capabilities.
North Korea is assessed to possess large-scale cyber units as part of its
asymmetric military capabilities, engaging in theft of military secrets and
developing capabilities to attack critical infrastructure of foreign countries.
North Korea also retains large-scale special operation forces.
Such military developments of North Korea pose grave and imminent
threats to Japan’s security and significantly undermine peace and security of
the region and the international community. Through United Nations Security
Council resolutions, the international community also has made it clear that
North Korea’s nuclear- and ballistic missile-related activities constitute a
clear threat to international peace and security.
Russia is enhancing its military posture by continuing force modernization
efforts with a focus on nuclear forces. Russia is in sharp confrontation with
Europe and the United States over issues including situation in Ukraine.
Russia’s military activities are trending upward in the Arctic Circle, Europe,
areas around the United States and the Middle East, as well as in the Far East
including Japan’s Northern Territories. Close attention therefore needs to be
paid to its developments.

3. Characteristics of Japan
Surrounded by sea on all sides and with long coastlines, Japan possesses
numerous islands remote from the mainland and is blessed with vast


-----

Exclusive Economic Zones: spread widely therein are life, person and
property of its nationals, territorial land, waters and airspace, as well as
various resources, all of which Japan must defend to the end. For Japan, a
maritime nation dependent on overseas trade for the bulk of energy resources
and food supplies, fundamental to its peace and prosperity is to ensure the
safety of maritime and air traffic by strengthening the order of “Open and
Stable Oceans,” an order based on fundamental norms such as rule of law and
freedom of navigation.
Japan is prone to natural disasters that exact heavy damage. Industry,
population and information infrastructure concentrate in Japan’s urban areas,
and a large number of critical facilities such as nuclear power plants are
located in coastal areas.
In addition, Japan is undergoing population decline and ageing with
dwindling birthrate at unprecedented pace. Severe fiscal conditions continue
as well.

4. Summary
In light of the foregoing, while the probability of a large-scale military
conflict between major countries, which was of concern during the Cold
War era, remains low, Japan’s security environment is becoming more
testing and uncertain at a remarkably faster speed than expected when the
“National Defense Program Guidelines for FY 2014 and beyond” (approved
by the National Security Council and the Cabinet on December 17, 2013 and
hereinafter referred to as the “former Guidelines”) was formulated.
To prevent threats to Japan from materializing to menace life and peaceful
livelihood of its nationals, it behooves Japan to take measures that are in line
with these realities.

**III. Japan’s Basic Defense Policy**
In line with the National Security Strategy and from the perspective of
“Proactive Contribution to Peace,” Japan has enhanced its diplomatic strength
and defense capability. Japan has also expanded and deepened cooperative
relationships with other countries, with the Japan-U.S. Alliance being a
cornerstone. In so doing, Japan under the Constitution has adhered to the
basic precept of maintaining the exclusively defense- oriented policy and not
becoming a military power that poses threat to other countries, ensured civilian
control of the military, and observed the Three Non-Nuclear Principles.
Japan under these precepts will ever not change the course it has taken as
a peace- loving nation. Based on this premise, Japan, even amid the realities
of security environment it has hitherto never faced, must strive to preserve
national interests identified in the National Security Strategy—defend to the
end Japanese nationals’ life, person and property, territorial land, waters and
airspace, and its sovereignty and independence. To that end, the Government
will identify national defense objectives and the means to achieve them, and
proactively and strategically promote measures with added variety.
National defense objectives are: first, to create, on a steady-state basis,
security environment desirable for Japan by integrating and drawing on the
strengths at the nation’s disposal; second, to deter threat from reaching Japan
by making opponent realize that doing harm to Japan would be difficult and
consequential; and finally, should threat reach Japan, to squarely counter the
threat and minimize damage.
Japan will strengthen each of the means by which to successfully achieve
these national defense objectives: Japan’s own architecture for national
defense; the Japan-U.S. Alliance; and international security cooperation.
These efforts, including achieving superiority in new domains, which are
space, cyberspace, and electromagnetic spectrum, must be carried out swiftly
and flexibly in order to deal with increasingly complex security environment
that is changing at accelerating speeds.
In dealing with the threat of nuclear weapons, U.S. extended deterrence,
with nuclear deterrence at its core, is essential: Japan will closely cooperate
with the United States to maintain and enhance its credibility. To deal with the
threat, Japan will also increase its own efforts including comprehensive air
and missile defense as well as civil protection. At the same time, towards the
long-term goal of bringing about a world free of nuclear weapons, Japan will
play an active and positive role in nuclear disarmament and non-proliferation.

1. Strengthening Japan’s own architecture for national defense
(1) Building comprehensive architecture for national defense
In order to squarely address the realities of security environment that it has
hitherto never faced and to securely achieve national defense objectives,
Japan will build national defense architecture that in all phases integrates
the strengths at the nation’s disposal: this structure enables not only
Ministry of Defense (MOD) and Self-Defense Forces (SDF) efforts but also
coherent, whole-of-government efforts; and enables cooperation with local
governments and private entities. In particular, Japan will accelerate its
efforts and cooperation in such fields as space, cyberspace, electromagnetic
spectrum, ocean, and science & technology, and also promote measures
concerning the formulation of international norms in fields such as space and
cyberspace.
Japan will further advance steady-state efforts such as strategic
communications by systematically combining all available policy tools.
In order to address a range of situations including armed contingencies and
“gray- zone” situations, Japan has been strengthening its posture under the


principle of civilian control of the military. Japan further needs to seamlessly
deal with various situations in a coherent, whole-of-government manner by
way of swift and pertinent decision-making under even stronger political
leadership, which will be assisted by enhanced support mechanism. In view
of protecting the life, person and property of its nationals, Japan will also
continue to strengthen organization for disaster response and civil protection,
and, in cooperation with local governments, work to secure evacuation
facilities. Japan will build a posture fully prepared to evacuate Japanese
nationals overseas during emergencies and ensure their safety. Japan will
promote measures to protect infrastructure critical to people’s daily lives such
as electricity and communication as well as to protect cyberspace.
In addition to making aforementioned efforts, in order to ensure the
effectiveness of various policies and measures, Japan will, on a steady-state
basis, devise and review relevant plans while systematizing them; also,
expand the use of simulations and comprehensive training and exercises to
improve the effectiveness of emergency response posture.

(2) Strengthening Japan’s defense capability
a. Significance and necessity of defense capability
Defense capability is the ultimate guarantor of Japan’s national security.
Defense capability represents Japan’s will and ability to: deter threat from
reaching Japan; and should threat reach Japan, eliminate the threat and, as a
sovereign nation, by exerting efforts on its own accord and initiative, defend
to the end Japanese nationals’ life, person and property as well as territorial
land, waters and airspace.
At the same time, defense capability is essential for Japan to play on its
initiative its roles in the Japan-U.S. Alliance at all phases from peacetime to
armed contingencies. Strengthening Japan’s defense capability to provide for
national security is none other than strengthening the Japan-U.S. Alliance.
Defense capability is essential also for advancing Japan’s efforts in security
cooperation with other countries.
Defense capability is the most important strength for Japan in retaining
self- sustained existence as a sovereign nation amid security environment
it has never faced before. Japan must strengthen this capability on its own
accord and initiative.
b. Truly effective defense capability – Multi-domain Defense Force
To be able to deter and counter qualitatively and quantitatively superior
military threats in increasingly testing security environment, it has become
vitally important to adapt to warfare that combines capabilities in new
domains—space, cyberspace and electromagnetic spectrum—and traditional
domains—land, sea and air.
Japan needs to develop, while qualitatively and quantitatively enhancing
capabilities in individual domains, a defense capability that can execute
cross-domain operations, which organically fuse capabilities in all domains
to generate synergy and amplify the overall strength, so that even when
inferiority exists in individual domains such inferiority will be overcome and
national defense accomplished.
In order to ensure national defense in increasingly uncertain security
environment, it is also important for Japan to be able to seamlessly conduct
activities at all stages from peacetime to armed contingencies. To date,
Japan has endeavored to develop a defense capability that allows to engage
in diverse activities in a swift and sustainable manner. In recent years,
however, SDF has had to increase the scope and frequency of its steady- state
activities such as maintaining presence, as well as intelligence, surveillance
and reconnaissance (ISR) activities: This is exacting a chronic burden on its
personnel and equipment, generating a concern that SDF may not be able to
maintain proficiency and the volume of its activities.
Japan needs to: improve quality and quantity of capabilities that support
sustainability and resiliency of various activities; and develop a defense
capability that enables sustained conduct of flexible and strategic activities
commensurate with the character of given situations.
Further, Japan’s defense capability needs to be capable of strengthening
the ability of the Japan-U.S. Alliance to deter and counter threats as well as
promoting multi-faceted and multi-layered security cooperation.
In light of the foregoing, Japan will henceforth build a truly effective
defense capability, “Multi-Domain Defense Force,” which: organically fuses
capabilities in all domains including space, cyberspace and electromagnetic
spectrum; and is capable of sustained conduct of flexible and strategic
activities during all phases from peacetime to armed contingencies. The
development of “Multi-Domain Defense Force” will be done while honing
the attributes of “Dynamic Joint Defense Force” under the former Guidelines.

(3) Roles that defense capability should play
In order to create a security environment desirable for Japan and to deter and
counter threats, Japan’s defense capability must be able to serve the roles
specified below in a seamless and combined manner. In particular, in view
of protecting the life and peaceful livelihood of Japanese nationals, it is all
the more important for Japan’s defense capability to fulfill diverse roles on a
steady-state basis.
a. From peacetime to “gray-zone” situations
SDF will enhance its presence on a steady-state basis by actively engaging
in, among others, joint training and exercises and overseas port visits, thereby
demonstrating Japan’s will and capability. SDF will, in close integration with


-----

diplomacy, promote strategic communications including aforementioned
activities by SDF units. SDF will leverage its capabilities in all domains to
conduct wide-area, persistent intelligence, surveillance and reconnaissance
(hereinafter referred to as “persistent ISR”) activities around Japan. SDF
will prevent occurrence or escalation of emergencies by employing flexible
deterrent options and other measures. Leveraging posture in place for these
activities, SDF will, in coordination with the police and other agencies,
immediately take appropriate measures in response to actions that violate
Japan’s sovereignty including incursions into its territorial airspace and
waters.
SDF will provide persistent protection against incoming ballistic missiles
and other threats, and minimize damage should it occur.
b. Attack against Japan including its remote islands
In response to attack on Japan including its remote islands, SDF will quickly
maneuver and deploy requisite units to block access and landing of invading
forces while ensuring maritime and air superiority. Even when maintaining
maritime and air superiority becomes untenable, SDF will block invading
forces’ access and landing from outside their threat envelopes. Should
any part of the territory be occupied, SDF will retake it by employing all
necessary measures.
Against airborne attack by missiles and aircraft, SDF will respond in a
swift and sustained manner by applying optimal means and minimize damage
to maintain SDF’s capabilities as well as the infrastructure upon which such
capabilities are employed.
In response to attack by guerrillas or special operations forces, SDF
will protect critical facilities including nuclear power plants and search and
destroy infiltrating forces.
c. Space, cyber and electromagnetic domains during all phases
In space, cyber and electromagnetic domains, to prevent any actions that
impede its activities, SDF will conduct on a steady-state basis persistent
monitoring as well as collection and analysis of relevant information. In case
of such event, SDF will promptly identify incidents and take such measures
as damage limitation and recovery.
In case of armed attack against Japan, SDF will, on top of taking these
actions, block and eliminate the attack by leveraging capabilities in space,
cyber and electromagnetic domains.
In addition, in light of the society’s growing dependence on space and
cyberspace, SDF will contribute to comprehensive, whole-of-government
efforts concerning these domains under appropriate partnership and shared
responsibility with relevant organizations.
d. Large-scale disasters
In case of large-scale disasters, to protect the life, person, and property of
Japanese nationals, SDF will swiftly transport and deploy requisite units to
take all necessary measures for initial response, and, as required, maintain its
posture for disaster response for a longer term. SDF will carefully address the
needs of affected citizens and local governments, and engage in life saving,
temporary repair and livelihood support in appropriate partnership and
cooperation with relevant organizations, local governments and the private
sector.
e. Collaboration with the United States based on the Japan-U.S. Alliance
In all stages from peacetime to armed contingencies, in line with the
“Guidelines for Japan-U.S. Defense Cooperation,” Japan will effectively
conduct activities described in 2. by playing on its initiative its own roles in
the Japan-U.S. Alliance.
f. Promotion of security cooperation
SDF will actively engage in efforts for enhanced security cooperation as stated
in 3.: In accordance with policies that are tailored to individual regions and
countries, SDF will strategically promote defense cooperation and exchanges
such as: joint training and exercises, cooperation in defense equipment and
technologies, capacity building assistance, and service-to-service exchange.

2. Strengthening the Japan-U.S. Alliance
The Japan-U.S. Security Arrangements based on the Japan-U.S. Security
Treaty, together with Japan’s own national defense architecture, constitute
a cornerstone for Japan’s national security. The Japan-U.S. Alliance, with
the Japan-U.S. Security Arrangements as its core, plays a significant role for
peace, stability and prosperity of not only Japan but also the Indo-Pacific
region and the international community.
As inter-sate competitions prominently emerge, it has become all the
more important for Japan’s national security to further strengthen relationship
with the United States, with whom Japan shares universal values and strategic
interests. The United States also views that cooperation with its allies has
become more important.
While the Japan-U.S. Alliance has been reinforced through activities
including those that were made possible by the Legislation for Peace and
Security, Japan needs to further enhance the Alliance through efforts under
the “Guidelines for Japan-US Defense Cooperation” in order to achieve
its national defense objective as security environment surrounding Japan
becomes more testing and uncertain at remarkably fast speeds.
In further strengthening the Japan-U.S. Alliance, it is an essential premise
that Japan strengthen its own defense capability on its own accord and
initiative. Fulfilling this premise, Japan needs to press ahead with efforts
such as: bolstering the ability of the Alliance to deter and counter threats;


enhancing and expanding cooperation in a wide range of areas; and steadily
implementing measures concerning the stationing of U.S. Forces in Japan.

(1) Strengthening ability of Japan-U.S. Alliance to deter and counter threats
In all stages from peacetime to armed contingencies as well as during
disasters, Japan will enhance information sharing with the United States,
conduct effective and smooth bilateral coordination involving all relevant
organizations and take all necessary measures to ensure Japan’s peace and
security.
For these purposes, Japan will further deepen various operational
cooperation and policy coordination with the United States. In particular,
Japan will expand and deepen cooperation in: space and cyber domains;
comprehensive air and missile defense; bilateral training and exercises;
bilateral ISR operations; and bilateral flexible deterrent options. Japan will
also promote formulation and renewal of bilateral plans and deepen the
Extended Deterrence Dialogue. In addition, Japan will even more actively
conduct activities such as logistic support for U.S. force activities and
protection of U.S. ships and aircraft.

(2) Strengthening and expanding cooperation in a wide range of areas
In order to create a desirable security environment including maintaining
and enhancing free and open maritime order, and with an eye on increasing
Japanese and U.S. presence in the Indo-Pacific region, Japan will conduct
bilateral activities such as capacity building assistance, humanitarian
assistance/disaster relief (HA/DR) and counter-piracy.
In order for Japan and the United States to be able to fully leverage
their capabilities during bilateral activities, Japan will enhance and expand
cooperation with the United States in such areas as equipment, technology,
facility, and intelligence as well as information security.
In particular, Japan will promote standardization of defense equipment
that contributes to Japan-U.S. bilateral activities, and sharing of various
networks. In order to support sustainable U.S. force activities around Japan as
well as to ensure high operational availability of SDF equipment, Japan will
build capacity for in-country maintenance of U.S.-made equipment.
To efficiently improve Japanese and U.S. capabilities, while facilitating
common understanding of respective priorities in defense capability
enhancement, promote measures such as effective acquisition of advanced
U.S equipment through optimized Foreign Military Sales (FMS) and JapanU.S. joint research and development.
With respect to SDF facilities and U.S force facilities and areas including
training facilities and areas, Japan will promote cooperation on joint/shared
use and efforts for improved resiliency.

(3) Steady implementation of measures concerning stationing of U.S. Forces in
Japan
Japan will provide stable support for smooth and effective stationing of U.S.
forces in Japan through various measures including Host Nation Support
(HNS). Japan will also steadily implement the realignment of U.S. forces in
Japan to mitigate impact on local communities while maintaining deterrence
provided by U.S. forces.
Okinawa is located in areas critically important to Japan’s national
security and U.S. force stationing in Okinawa greatly contributes to deterrent
the Japan-U.S. alliance provides: At the same time, facilities and areas of U.S.
forces in Japan are highly concentrated in Okinawa. In light of this, Japan in
recent years has been furthering its efforts to mitigate impact on Okinawa
including returns of U.S. facilities and areas. Japan will continue to work
to mitigate impact on Okinawa by steadily implementing such measures as
realignment, consolidation and reduction of facilities and areas of U.S. forces
in Okinawa including the relocation of Marine Corps Air Station Futenma as
well as the dispersion of impact on Okinawa.

3. Strengthening security cooperation
In line with the vision of free and open Indo-Pacific, Japan will strategically
promote multifaceted and multilayered security cooperation, taking into
account characteristics and situation specific to each region and country.
As part of such efforts, Japan will actively leverage its defense capability to
work on defense cooperation and exchanges which include joint training and
exercises, defense equipment and technology cooperation, capacity building
assistance, and interchanges among military branches. Furthermore, Japan
will also contribute to address global security challenges. In implementing
these initiatives, Japan will position the Japan-U.S. Alliance as its cornerstone
and will work closely with the countries that share universal values and
security interests, through full coordination with its diplomatic policy.

(1) Promoting defense cooperation and exchanges
With Australia, to further improve interoperability and by utilizing
frameworks such as Foreign and Defense Ministerial Consultations (“2+2”),
Japan will further promote joint training and exercises and defense equipment
and technology cooperation, and advance cooperative activities such as
bilaterally-aligned capacity building assistance to third parties. Japan will
also strengthen cooperative relations under trilateral framework among Japan,
Australia and the United States, which share universal values and strategic
interests.

practical bilateral and multilateral cooperation, including joint training and
exercises, defense equipment and technology cooperation, and capacity
building assistance.
With the Republic of Korea (ROK), Japan will promote defense
cooperation in a broad range of fields and strive to establish the foundation
for collaboration. Japan will also continue to strengthen trilateral cooperation
among Japan, the ROK and the United States to maintain peace and stability
in the region.
With the United Kingdom and France, to contribute to the stability of
maritime order in the Indo-Pacific region, Japan will, while leveraging such
frameworks as the “2+2,” promote efforts including more practical joint
training and exercises, defense equipment and technology cooperation and
bilateral collaboration on third-party engagement. Japan will strengthen
cooperation with European countries as well as NATO and the European
Union (EU).
With Canada and New Zealand, Japan will promote efforts including
joint training and exercises as well as bilateral collaboration on third-party
engagement.
With China, in order to enhance mutual understanding and trust, Japan
will promote multi-layered dialogues and exchange. In so doing, Japan will
continue to encourage China to play responsible and constructive roles for
peace and stability in the Indo-Pacific region, comply with international
norms of conduct, and improve transparency regarding military capability
enhancement. In order to avoid unexpected situations between the two
countries, Japan will utilize the “Maritime and Aerial Communication
Mechanism between the defense authorities of Japan and China” in a manner
that contributes to building a trusting relationship between the two countries.
Japan will calmly and firmly deal with Chinese activities at sea and in the air
around Japan.
With Russia, in order to enhance mutual understanding and trust, Japan
will promote security dialogues with Russia including the “2+2,” high-level
interactions and broad unit-to-unit exchanges, and deepen joint training and
exercises.
With island nations of the Pacific Ocean, Japan will promote port and
airport visits by SDF as well as exchanges and cooperation that utilize
capabilities and characteristics of each service of SDF.
With countries in Central Asia, the Middle East and Africa, in order to
build and strengthen cooperative relations Japan will promote exchanges at
all levels, including high level, and cooperation in such fields as capacity
building assistance related to the United Nations Peacekeeping Operations.
Regarding multilateral frameworks, Japan attaches importance to
the East Asia Summit (EAS), the ASEAN Defense Ministers’ MeetingPlus (ADMM-Plus) and the ASEAN Regional Forum (ARF) that provide
significant foundations for discussions, cooperation and exchanges related to
security field in the Indo-Pacific region. In addition, Japan will contribute to
strengthening cooperation and mutual trust among the countries in the region.

(2) Responding to global issues
From the viewpoint of securing the freedom and security of navigation and
flight, Japan will promote cooperation to contribute to the improvement of
capabilities pertaining to the maritime security of coastal states in the IndoPacific region, which include South Asian countries such as India and Sri
Lanka, as well as Southeast Asian countries. Moreover, Japan will promote
such activities as joint training and exercises, unit-to-unit exchanges and
active port visits at these occasions. Japan will also conduct activities such
as anti-piracy efforts in cooperation with relevant countries and cooperation
for strengthening capabilities of the Maritime Domain Awareness (MDA).
Regarding the use of space domain, Japan will promote partnership and
cooperation in various fields including the Space Situational Awareness
(SSA) and mission assurance of the entire space system, through consultations
and information sharing with relevant countries and active participation in
multilateral exercises among others. Regarding the use of cyber domain,
Japan will enhance its partnership and cooperation with relevant countries
through measures such as sharing views on threat awareness, exchanging
views on response to cyber attacks, and participating in multilateral exercises.
In cooperation with relevant countries and international organizations,
Japan will promote non-proliferation efforts regarding: weapons of mass
destruction and missiles which can serve as their delivery means; and goods
and sensitive technologies of potential military use. Leveraging SDF’s
knowledge and human resources, Japan will engage in various activities
related to arms control and disarmament undertaken by the United Nations
and other bodies, including the discussion on Lethal Autonomous Weapons
Systems (LAWS).
In line with the Legislation for Peace and Security, Japan will
actively promote international peace cooperation activities, while giving


comprehensive consideration to such factors as purposes of mission, situation
in host country, and political and economic relations between Japan and
host country. While making good use of past experiences to develop human
resources, Japan will actively contribute through such efforts as sending
embedded personnel to mission headquarters and capacity building assistance
in areas that Japan excels. Regarding SDF operation facility in the Republic
of Djibouti, which is used for anti-piracy efforts, Japan will work towards
stable, long-term use of the facility for regional security cooperation and other
activities.

**IV. Priorities in Strengthening Defense Capability**
1. Guiding thoughts
In order to adapt to increasingly rapid changes in security environment,
Japan must strengthen its defense capability at speeds that are fundamentally
different from the past. In view of aging population with declining birth rate
and severe fiscal situation, it is essential that Japan use budget and personnel
even more effectively.
In strengthening defense capability, Japan will enhance priority capability
areas as early as possible, allocating resources flexibly and intensively without
adhering to existing budget and human resource allocation, and undertake
necessary fundamental reforms.
In taking these measures, SDF will further promote joint-ness of the
Ground, Maritime and Air Self-Defense Forces in all areas and, avoiding
stove-piped approach, optimize their organizations and equipment. In
particular, SDF will further promote joint- ness in a wide range of areas
such as capabilities in new domains, which are space, cyberspace and
electromagnetic spectrum, comprehensive air and missile defense, damage
recovery, transportation, maintenance, supply, security, education, medical
service and research.
With respect to hedging against invasion scenarios such as amphibious
landing employing large-scale ground forces, which were assumed primarily
during the Cold War period, SDF will retain forces only enough to maintain
and carry on the minimum necessary expertise and skills with which to adapt
to changes in situation in the future, and work further to achieve even greater
efficiency and rationalization.

2. Priorities in strengthening capabilities necessary for cross-domain operations
(1) Acquiring and strengthening capabilities in space, cyber and electromagnetic
domains
In order to realize cross-domain operations, SDF will acquire and strengthen
capabilities in new domains, which are space, cyberspace and electromagnetic
spectrum by focusing resources and leveraging Japan’s superb science and
technology. In doing so, SDF will strengthen and protect command, control,
communications and information capabilities that effectively connect
capabilities in all domains including the new ones.
a. Capabilities in space domain
Effective use of satellites for such purposes as information-gathering,
communication and positioning is essential for realizing cross-domain
operations. On the other hand, threats to the stable use of space are increasing.
SDF therefore will further improve various capabilities that leverage space
domain including information-gathering, communication and positioning
capabilities. SDF will also build a structure to conduct persistent ground- and
space-based space situation monitoring. To ensure superiority in use of space
at all stages from peacetime to armed contingencies, SDF will also work to
strengthen capabilities including mission assurance capability and capability
to disrupt opponent’s command, control, communications and information.
In so doing, SDF will actively leverage civilian technologies and work to
enhance cooperation with relevant agencies including the Japan Aerospace
Exploration Agency (JAXA) and with the United States and other relevant
countries. SDF will also engage in organization building such as the creation
of units specializing in space and dedicated career field, and develop human
resources and accumulate knowledge and expertise in the space field.
b. Capabilities in cyber domain
Information and communications networks that leverage cyberspace are a
foundation for SDF’s activities in various domains, and attack against them
seriously disrupts organized activities of SDF. In order to prevent such attack,
SDF will continue to strengthen capabilities for persistent monitoring of
command and communications systems and networks as well as for damage
limitation and recovery. In addition, SDF will fundamentally strengthen its
cyber defense capability, including capability to disrupt, during attack against
Japan, opponent’s use of cyberspace for the attack.
In so doing, SDF will significantly expand its human resources with
specialized expertise and skills, and take into consideration its contributions
to whole-of-government efforts.
c. Capabilities in electromagnetic domain
Since the use of electromagnetic spectrum has expanded in range and purpose,
it is now recognized as a major operational domain situated on the frontline
of offense-defense dynamic in today’s warfare. Ensuring superiority in
electromagnetic domain is also critical to realizing cross-domain operations.
SDF will work to enhance information and communications capabilities
as well as information collection and analysis capabilities related to
electromagnetics, and develop an information sharing posture. SDF will
improve capabilities to minimize the effect of opponent’s electronic


-----

jamming. In addition, SDF will strengthen capabilities to neutralize radar
and communications of opponent who intends to invade Japan. In order to
smoothly perform these activities, SDF will enhance its ability to appropriately
manage and coordinate the use of electromagnetic spectrum.

(2) Enhancing capabilities in traditional domains
SDF will enhance capabilities to effectively counter attacks by aircraft, ships
and missiles during cross-domain operations in close combination with
capabilities in space, cyber and electromagnetic domains.
a. Capabilities in maritime and air domains
In order to effectively deal with armed attack against Japan, it is extremely
important for Japan to establish and maintain maritime and air superiority.
SDF will reinforce its posture for conducting persistent ISR at sea and in
the air around Japan.
SDF will also strengthen surface and underwater operational capabilities
including Unmanned Underwater Vehicles (UUV).
By taking measures such as developing a fighter force structure that
features Short Take-Off and Vertical Landing (STOVL) fighter aircraft
which bring operational flexibility, SDF will improve air operation capability
particularly on the Pacific side of Japan, where number of air bases is limited
despite its vast airspace. In so doing, as number of air bases that allow for
take-off and landing of fighters is limited, Japan will take necessary measures
to enable STOVL fighter aircraft to operate from existing SDF ships as
required, in order to further improve flexibility in fighter operations while
ensuring safety of SDF personnel.
b. Stand-off defense capability
As other countries make remarkable advances in early warning and control
capabilities and the performance of various missiles, SDF needs to effectively
intercept attack against Japan, while ensuring safety of its personnel.
SDF will acquire stand-off firepower and other requisite capabilities
to deal with ships and landing forces attempting to invade Japan including
remote islands from the outside of their threat envelopes. In addition, in
order to appropriately leverage advances in military technologies, Japan will
swiftly and flexibly strengthen stand-off defense capability through measures
such as comprehensive research and development of related technologies.

c. Comprehensive air and missile defense capability
Japan needs to effectively and efficiently counter increasingly diverse and
complex airborne threats of ballistic and cruise missiles and aircraft by
optimum means and minimize damage.
SDF will establish a structure with which to conduct integrated
operation of various equipment pieces, those for missile defense as well as
air defense equipment that each SDF service has separately used, thereby
providing persistent nation-wide protection and also enhancing capability to
simultaneously deal with multiple, complex airborne threats. SDF will also
study ways to counter future airborne threats.
Based on basic role and mission sharing between Japan and the United
States, in order to strengthen the deterrent of the Japan-U.S. Alliance as a
whole, Japan will continue to study a potential form of response capability
to address the means for missile launch and related facilities and will take
necessary measures.
d. Maneuver and deployment capability
In order to effectively deal with various situations such as attack on remote
islands, requisite SDF units need to conduct sustained, persistent activities
in appropriate areas on a steady-state basis and to maneuver and deploy
according to situation.
SDF will strengthen amphibious operation and other capabilities. In
addition, to enable swift and large-scale transport, SDF will strengthen joint
transport capability including inter- and intra-theater transport capabilities
tailored to the characteristics of remote island areas. SDF will also work to
collaborate with commercial transport on a steady-state basis.

(3) Strengthening sustainability and resiliency
To be able to sustain a range of requisite activities at all stages from peacetime
to armed contingencies, sustainability and resiliency of defense capability
including logistics support needs to be enhanced.
SDF will take necessary measures for securing ammunition and fuel,
ensuring maritime shipping lanes, and protecting important infrastructure. In
particular, while cooperating with relevant ministries and agencies, SDF will
improve sustainability through safe and steady acquisition and stockpiling
of ammunition and fuel. SDF will also improve resiliency in a multi-layered
way through efforts including dispersion, recovery, and substitution of
infrastructure and other foundations for SDF operations. Further, SDF
will work toward more effective and efficient equipment maintenance by
reviewing existing maintenance methods, thereby ensuring high operational
availability.

3. Priorities in strengthening core elements of defense capability
(1) Reinforcing human resource base
The core element of defense capability is SDF personnel. Securing human
resources for SDF personnel and improving their ability and morale are
essential to strengthening defense capability. This has become an imminent
challenge in the face of shrinking and aging population with declining birth


rates. Also in light of sustainability and resilience of defense capability, SDF
needs to work even further to reinforce human resource base that sustains
SDF personnel.
MOD/SDF will promote efforts, including those address institutional
aspects, in order to secure diverse, high-quality talents from a wider range
of people. These efforts include: various recruitment measures such as
cooperation with local governments and other entities; diversifying applicant
pool including college graduates; expanding women’s participation;
appropriate extension of SDF personnel’s mandatory retirement ages;
leveraging retired SDF personnel as well as reserve personnel; and measures
for raising fulfillment rates. MOD/SDF will also promote manpower saving
and automation by leveraging technological innovations such as artificial
intelligence.
To enable all SDF personnel to maintain high morale and continue to fully
exercise their ability, MOD/SDF will improve living and work environment
and promote work style reforms at MOD/SDF to ensure proper work-life
balance.
Through such efforts as enhancing joint education and research, MOD/
SDF will enrich education and research to improve SDF’s capabilities
and foster its unity. MOD/SDF will enhance education for organization
management skills. In addition, MOD/SDF will improve treatment through
measures concerning honors and privileges, and allowance increase that
reflects the special nature of SDF’s missions. MOD/SDF will also further
improve re-employment support for SDF personnel in view of the fact that
it is the responsibility of the Government to secure the livelihood of SDF
personnel under the mandatory early retirement system.

(2) Reviewing equipment structure
MOD/SDF will examine the existing equipment structure from joint operation
perspective and build an optimized equipment structure. In so doing, while
giving due considerations to capabilities each SDF service requires for its
operations, MOD/SDF will: develop equipment with multiple functional
variants; optimize and standardize specifications of equipment; and jointly
procure equipment commonly used across SDF services; reduce types of
aircraft; suspend the use of equipment whose importance has decreased; and
review or discontinue projects of low cost-effectiveness.

(3) Reinforcing technology base
As character of warfare changes dramatically due to advances in military
technologies, it is becoming all the more important to reinforce technological
base that has bearing on defense equipment through whole-of-government
approach by leveraging Japan’s superb science and technology.
MOD/SDF will make focused investments through selection and
concentration in important technologies including artificial intelligence
and other potentially game- changing technologies. MOD/SDF will also
dramatically shorten research and development timelines by streamlining
R&D processes and procedures. In doing so, MOD/SDF will encourage
company’s prior investments and leverage its strength to full potential by
actively using design proposal-based competition scheme and improving
foreseeability through the formulation of R&D visions on capabilities
required for Japan’s future national defense.
In addition, MOD/SDF will work to actively leverage potentially dualuse, advanced commercial technologies through such efforts as: technology
exchange with relevant domestic and overseas entities; enhanced collaboration
with relevant ministries and agencies; and use of the “Innovative Science &
Technology Initiative for Security” program.
MOD/SDF will reinforce its structure aimed at early discovery of
innovative, emerging technologies and fostering thereof by utilizing and
creating think tanks that survey and analyze latest foreign and domestic
technological trends.

(4) Optimizing equipment procurement
In order to secure necessary and sufficient quality and quantity of SDF
equipment, MOD/SDF needs to acquire high-performance equipment at the
most affordable prices possible. MOD/SDF also needs to do thorough cost
management and reduction not only during budget development but also
during budget implementation.
MOD/SDF will actively use systematic acquisition methods including
long-term contracts which facilitate efficient procurement, and streamline
equipment maintenance. MOD/SDF will facilitate competition among
domestic and foreign companies, and promote defense equipment development
that eyes towards international joint development and production as well as
overseas transfer. In order to efficiently procure U.S.-made high-performance
equipment, MOD/SDF will promote rationalization of FMS procurement and
work to align procurement timings and specifications with U.S. forces and
other parties. In taking these steps, MOD/SDF will further strengthen efforts
on project management throughout the entire life cycle of defense equipment.
(5) Strengthening defense industrial base
Japan’s defense industry is an essential foundation for the production,
operation, and maintenance of defense equipment. For the production of highperformance equipment and to ensure their high operational availability, it
is necessary to make defense industrial base more resilient by overcoming
challenges such as high costs due to low- volume, high-mix production and


-----

lack of international competitiveness, thereby enabling it to effectively adapt
to changing security environment.
In addition to taking various measures concerning equipment structure,
technological base, and equipment procurement, to create a competitive
environment for companies, MOD/SDF will reform the existing contract
system including affording incentives to companies. MOD/SDF will enhance
supply-chain risk management and work to further expand Japanese defense
industry’s participation in maintenance work of imported equipment. For
whole-of-government efforts to promote appropriate overseas transfer
of defense equipment under the Three Principles on Transfer of Defense
Equipment and Technology, which permits transfer of defense equipment
in cases where the transfer contributes to Japan’s security, MOD/SDF will
work to make necessary improvements in the Principles’ implementation. At
the same time, MOD/SDF will strengthen intellectual property management,
technology management and information security in order to prevent drain
of important defense equipment-related technologies. Through abovementioned measures, MOD/SDF will work to reduce equipment costs and
improve industrial competitiveness, thereby striving to build resilient defense
industrial base. MOD/SDF will also examine further measures to that end.

(6) Enhancing intelligence capabilities
MOD/SDF will enhance intelligence capabilities to provide timely, effective
intelligence support to policy decision and SDF operations. MOD/SDF will
strengthen capabilities for each stage of collection, processing, analysis,
sharing, and protection so that SDF can promptly detect and swiftly respond
to indications of various situations and also take requisite measures based on
medium- to long-term military trends.
In so doing, while giving due considerations to technological trends in
information processing, MOD/SDF will strengthen capability and posture,
including those related to new domains, for the collection of SIGINT, IMINT,
HUMINT, OSINT and others. MOD/SDF will enhance collaboration with
relevant domestic agencies including the Cabinet Satellite Intelligence Center
which operates Information Gathering Satellites and with the ally as well as
with other parties. MOD/SDF will work to hire, retain and train personnel for
information collection and analysis and to acquire and connect informationsharing systems. MOD/SDF also will establish more robust information
security regime and strengthen counter-intelligence capability.

**V. Organization of Self-Defense Forces**
In order to realize cross-domain operations, SDF will strengthen joint
operations as described in 1 and develop organization of each SDF service as
described in sections from 2 to 4. Organic structure of major units and specific
quantities of major equipment in the future are as shown in the Annex table.

1. Joint operation to realize cross-domain operations

In view of the excellent training environment it offers, GSDF will
maintain half of rapidly deployable basic operational units in Hokkaido,
on the premise that these units will deploy and move via joint transport
capability.
GSDF will strengthen its ability to deter and counter threats by taking
measures including: persistent steady-state maneuver such as coordinated
activities between ships and Amphibious Rapid Deployment Brigade and
other mobile operating units as well as their various training and exercises;
stationing of units in remote islands hitherto without SDF presence; and
establishing networks with MSDF and ASDF.
(2) To be able to counter invasion of remote islands, GSDF will maintain
surface-to-ship guided missile units and hyper-velocity gliding projectile
units for remote island defense.
(3) With respect to basic operational units (divisions and brigades) other
than the rapidly deployable ones referred to in (1), GSDF will review
their organization and equipment with focus on tanks, howitzers and
rockets. With respect to units under the direct command of regional
armies, GSDF will also review their organization and equipment related
to aerial firepower. GSDF will thoroughly implement rationalization
and streamlining of these units and appropriately position them to meet
conditions and characteristics of each region.

3. Organization of MSDF
(1) In order to provide for defense in the waters around Japan and security
of maritime traffic through effective prosecution of persistent ISR,
antisubmarine operations and mine countermeasure operations, and to be
able to effectively engage in security cooperation with other countries,
MSDF will maintain reinforced destroyer units including destroyers with
improved multi-mission capabilities, minesweeper units and embarked
patrol helicopter units. MSDF will organize surface units composed of
these destroyer units and minesweeper units. In addition, MSDF will
maintain patrol ship units to enable enhanced steady-state ISR in the
waters around Japan.
With respect to the destroyers equipped with improved multi-mission
capabilities, MSDF will introduce multi-crew shiftwork and promote
collaboration with patrol ships equipped with high ISR capability, thereby
enhancing persistent ISR posture.
(2) In order to effectively conduct steady-state, wide-area underwater ISR,
and to effectively engage in patrols and defense in the waters around
Japan, MSDF will maintain reinforced submarine units.
By introducing a test-bed submarine, MSDF will work to achieve
greater efficiency in submarine operations and accelerate capability
improvement, thereby enhancing persistent ISR posture.
(3) In order to effectively conduct steady-state, wide-area airborne ISR, and
to effectively engage in patrols and defense in the waters around Japan,
MSDF will maintain fixed- wing patrol aircraft units.

4. Organization of ASDF
(1) ASDF will maintain air warning and control units consisting of groundbased warning and control units and reinforced airborne warning units:
ground-based warning and control units are capable of conducting
persistent surveillance in airspace around Japan including vast airspace
on the Pacific side; and airborne warning units are capable of conducting
effective, sustained airborne warning, surveillance and control during
“gray zone” and other situations with heightened tensions.
(2) In order to be able to provide for air defense in airspace around Japan
including vast airspace on the Pacific side with a comprehensive posture
that brings together fighter aircraft and supporting functions, ASDF will
maintain fighter aircraft units reinforced by high-performance fighter
aircraft. In order to enable fighter aircraft units and airborne warning
units to sustainably conduct various operations in wide areas, ASDF will
maintain reinforced aerial refueling and transport units.
(3) In order to be able to effectively carry out activities such as maneuver
and deployment of ground forces and security cooperation with foreign
countries, ASDF will maintain air transport units.
(4) In order to be able to conduct information collection in areas relatively
remote from Japan and persistent airborne monitoring during situations
with heightened tensions, ASDF will maintain unmanned aerial vehicle
units.

**VI. Elements Supporting Defense Capability**
For Japan’s defense capability to demonstrate its true value, SDF needs
to constantly maintain and improve its capabilities and foster broad
understanding by Japanese nationals.


-----

MOD/SDF will constantly and actively engage in public relations activities
regarding defense policies and activities. Upon fielding units and equipment
of SDF or U.S. Forces in Japan and conducting training and exercises, MOD/
SDF will make careful, detailed coordination to meet desires and conditions
of local communities, while sufficiently fulfilling accountability. At the
same time, MOD/SDF will continue to promote various impact alleviation
measures include noise mitigation.
MOD/SDF will further strengthen collaboration with relevant
organizations including local governments, police and fire departments in
order to enable SDF to swiftly and securely conduct its activities in response
to various situations.
In certain regions, presence of SDF units makes substantial contributions
to maintenance and revitalization of local communities. There are also cases
where SDF’s emergency patient transport is supporting community medicine.
In light of this, MOD/SDF will give due considerations to local conditions and
characteristics upon reorganization of operation units as well as placement of
SDF garrisons and bases. At the same time, in administering garrisons and
bases, MOD/SDF will give due considerations to their contributions to local
economies.

4. Intellectual Base
In order to facilitate understanding of security and crisis management among
the populace, MOD/SDF will work to promote security-related education
at educational institutions. Within MOD/SDF, in order to achieve at high
levels both academic research and policy-support by the National Institute
for Defense Studies (NIDS), MOD/SDF will facilitate NIDS’ collaboration
with the policy-making sector. MOD/SDF will further enhance its defense
research regime with NIDS playing central roles. In so doing, MOD/SDF
will promote systematic collaboration on education and research with other
research and educational institutions within the Government, as well as with
universities and think-tanks of excellence both at home and abroad.

**VII. Points of Attention**
1. Japan’s defense capability these Guidelines set forth envisions
approximately 10 years. The National Security Council will conduct
periodic, systematic evaluations throughout the course of implementation
of various measures and programs. In order to build truly effective defense


1. Training and exercises
In order to maintain and improve its tactical skills, SDF will conduct more
practical, effective and systematic training and exercises while, as necessary,
work in partnership with relevant organizations, local governments and the
private sector. In so doing, in order to conduct more practical training, SDF
will: develop and utilize domestic training ranges such as those in Hokkaido
as well as fine training environment overseas; facilitate joint/shared use
of U.S. Forces facilities and areas; facilitate use of places other than SDF
facilities or U.S. Forces facilities and areas; and more actively introduce
training simulators and others. SDF will also actively utilize training and
exercises to constantly examine and review various plans for emergencies.

2. Medical Care
SDF needs to enhance its medical functions to keep SDF personnel’s vitality
and enhance their ability to deal with various situations and engage in a
diverse range of missions at home and abroad. In order to protect the lives
of SDF personnel to the maxim extent possible, MOD/SDF will strengthen
its posture for medical care and onward transfer of patients, seamlessly
covering the entire stretch between the frontline and final medical evacuation
destinations. Taking into account conditions and characteristics of each
region, SDF will focus on strengthening medical functions of SDF in Japan’s
southwestern region. SDF will establish an efficient and high-quality medical
care regime through endeavors including upgrading of SDF hospitals into
medical hubs with enhanced functions. In order to secure medical personnel
in operation units, SDF will: improve the management of the National
Defense Medical College; enrich and enhance education and research such
as improving medical care capabilities for war injury. In addition, SDF will
improve requisite posture for various international cooperation including
capacity building assistance.

3. Collaboration with local communities
Amid increasingly testing and uncertain security environment, activities,
training and exercises of SDF and U.S. forces in Japan are becoming more
diverse and defense equipment more sophisticated. As a result, it is becoming
all the more important to gain understanding among and secure cooperation
from local governments and residents around defense facilities.

SDF will conduct verifications regarding capabilities required for Japan's
defense in the future.
2. When major changes in situation are anticipated during evaluation and
verification processes, these Guidelines will be amended as necessary after
examining current security environment and others.
3. Considering increasingly severe fiscal conditions and importance of other
budgets related to people’s daily life, MOD/SDF will work to achieve
greater efficiency and streamlining in defense force development to curb
costs. MOD/SDF will work to ensure that defense capability can smoothly
and fully perform its functions while harmonizing with other policies and
measures of the Government.

**Reference 7 Medium Term Defense Program (FY 2019 - FY 2023)**


activities and consultations with the U.S., in a wide range of areas under
“Guidelines for Japan-U.S. Defense Cooperation”. Japan will also
actively facilitate measures for the smooth and effective stationing of
U.S. forces in Japan.
In line with the vision of free and open Indo-Pacific, to strategically
promote multifaceted and multilayered security cooperation, Japan will
actively leverage its defense capability to promote defense cooperation
and exchanges which include joint training and exercises, defense
equipment and technology cooperation, capacity building assistance,
and interchanges among military branches.
5. With respect to hedging against invasion scenarios such as amphibious
landing employing large-scale ground forces, which were assumed
primarily during the Cold War period, SDF will retain forces only
enough to maintain and carry on the minimum necessary expertise
and skills with which to adapt to changes in situation in the future, by
achieving efficiency and rationalization.
6. Considering increasingly severe fiscal conditions and importance
of other budgets related to people’s daily life, MOD/SDF will work
to achieve greater efficiency and streamlining in defense force
development while harmonizing with other policies and measures of
the Government.

**II. Reorganization of the Major SDF Units**
1. In order to build a structure that is capable of realizing cross-domain
operations including new domains, which are space, cyberspace and
electromagnetic spectrum, SDF will strengthen the Joint Staff’s posture
designed for effective SDF operations and for new domains, thereby
enabling swift exercise of SDF’s capabilities. For the future framework
for joint operations, SDF will take necessary measures after considering
how to conduct the operation of organizations in which the functions in
the new domains are operated unitarily, and come to conclusions after
considering how the integrated structure should be during steady-state
to appropriately execute instructions from the Minister based on the
posture of the strengthened Joint Staff. SDF will also work to flexibly
leverage personnel of each SDF service through such efforts as building
posture for force protection and damage recovery with an eye on mutual
cooperation among SDF services.
SDF will establish 1 squadron of ASDF space domain mission unit
in order to conduct persistent monitoring of situations in space, and to
ensure superiority in use of space at all stages from peacetime to armed
contingencies.
SDF will establish 1 squadron of cyber defense unit as joint unit in
order to fundamentally strengthen cyber defense capabilities, including
capability to disrupt, in the event of attack against Japan, opponent’s use
of cyberspace for the attack as well as to conduct persistent monitoring
of SDF’s information and communications networks.
SDF will strengthen the Joint Staff’s posture in order to appropriately
manage and coordinate, from joint operation perspective, the use of
electromagnetic spectrum, and advance efforts to enhance defense
capability related to the use of electromagnetic spectrum in each SDF
service.
In order to provide persistent nation-wide protection on a steadystate basis and to be able to simultaneously deal with multiple, complex
airborne threats, GSDF will establish 2 squadrons of ballistic missile
defense (BMD) units. In addition, in order to operate units more
efficiently including command and control in accordance with the
enhancement of SDF’s ballistic missile response capabilities, ASDF
will reorganize surface-to-air guided missile units from 6 fire groups to
4 groups while maintaining 24 fire squadrons.
At all stages from peacetime to armed contingencies, SDF will
establish 1 group of maritime transportation unit as Joint Unit that
allows SDF units to swiftly maneuver and deploy in joint operations.
2. In order to strengthen operation capabilities in new domains, GSDF
will establish cyberspace units and electromagnetic operation units as
subordinate units of the Ground Component Command.
In order to respond swiftly, and to deter and counter effectively and
swiftly with various situations, GSDF will transform 1 division and
2 brigades respectively into 1 rapid deployment division and 2 rapid
deployment brigades that are furnished with advanced mobility and ISR
capabilities. In addition to rapid deployment divisions and brigades, an
amphibious rapid deployment brigade, which will be strengthened by
the establishment of 1 amphibious rapid deployment regiment, will
strengthen its ability to deter and counter threats through conducting
persistent steady-state maneuver such as coordinated activities with
ships as well as various training and exercises. In addition, through
continuing to establish area security units in charge of initial response
activities, MOD will newly establish surface-to-air guided missile
units and surface-to-ship guided missile units, GSDF will strengthen
its defense posture of the remote islands in the southwest region.
Furthermore, to counter invasion of remote islands, GSDF will take
necessary measures to establish hyper-velocity gliding projectile
(HVGP) units for the defense of remote islands.
From the perspective of enabling swift and flexible operations,


December 18, 2018
**I. Program Guidelines**
In the defense program for FY 2019 - FY 2023, with accordance to
“National Defense Program Guidelines for FY 2019 and beyond”
(approved by the National Security Council and Cabinet on December
18, 2018), Japan will significantly strengthen defense capability to build a
truly effective defense capability, “Multi- Domain Defense Force,” which:
organically fuses capabilities in all domains including space, cyberspace
and electromagnetic spectrum; and is capable of sustained conduct of
flexible and strategic activities during all phases from peacetime to armed
contingencies. The development of “Multi-Domain Defense Force” will be
done while honing the attributes of “Dynamic Joint Defense Force” under
the “National Defense Program Guidelines for FY 2014 and beyond”
(approved by the National Security Council and the Cabinet on December
17, 2013).
In order to adapt to increasingly rapid changes in security environment,
Japan will strengthen its defense capability at speeds that are fundamentally
different from the past. In view of aging population with declining birth
rate and severe fiscal situation, Japan will strengthen its defense capability
effectively by allocating resources flexibly and intensively without
adhering to existing budget and human resource allocation. Furthermore,
SDF will further promote joint-ness of the Ground, Maritime and Air SelfDefense Forces in all areas, avoid stove-piped approach and optimize their
organizations and equipment.
Given the guiding thoughts above, SDF will effectively and efficiently
build, maintain and operate defense capability based on the following
program guidelines:
1. In order to realize cross-domain operations, SDF will acquire and
strengthen capabilities in new domains, which are space, cyberspace
and electromagnetic spectrum by focusing resources and leveraging
Japan’s superb science and technology, and strengthen and protect
command, control, communications and information (C4I) capabilities
that effectively connect capabilities in all domains including the new
ones. In addition, SDF will enhance capabilities in maritime and
air domains, stand-off defense capability, comprehensive air and
missile defense capability and maneuver and deployment capability
to effectively counter attacks by aircraft, ships and missiles during
cross-domain operations in close combination with capabilities in
space, cyber and electromagnetic domains. Furthermore, to be able to
sustain a range of requisite activities at all stages from peacetime to
armed contingencies, sustainability and resiliency of defense capability
including logistics support will be enhanced.
2. In procuring equipment, by properly combining the introduction of new,
high- performance equipment, with life extension and improvement
of existing equipment, MOD/SDF will efficiently secure defense
capability in necessary and sufficient “quality” and “quantity”. In this
regard, MOD/SDF will strengthen its project management throughout
its equipment life-cycle, including during its research and development
activities, and reduce the life-cycle costs to improve cost-effectiveness.
Moreover, MOD/SDF will make focused investments through selection
and concentration in cutting-edge technologies. MOD/SDF will also
dramatically shorten research and development (R&D) timelines by
streamlining its processes and procedures.
3. In the face of rapidly shrinking and aging population with declining
birth rates, to ensure SDF’s strength, to strive to secure human resources
for SDF personnel and to improve their ability and morale, who are the
core element of defense capability, MOD/SDF will comprehensively
promote various measures to reinforce human resource base such
as securing diverse and high-quality talents including diversifying
applicant pool, promoting women’s participation and leveraging
reserve personnel, improving living and work environment, promoting
work style reforms, and improving treatment.
4. In order to maintain and strengthen the commitment of the United
States (U.S.) to Japan and the Indo-Pacific region and to secure Japan’s
security, and based on the premise that Japan will strengthen its
own capabilities, Japan will further promote a variety of cooperative


-----

while thoroughly facilitating efficiency and rationalizing preparations
for invasion, such as the landing of large-scale ground forces, GSDF
will steadily implement programs towards successive formation of units
equipped with mobile combat vehicles and disuse of tanks deployed
in basic operational units stationed in locations other than Hokkaido
and Kyushu. In addition, GSDF will steadily carry out programs that
concentrate howitzers deployed in basic operational units stationed
in locations other than Hokkaido into newly organized field artillery
units under the direct command of the respective regional armies.
Furthermore, GSDF will reduce its combat helicopter units under the
direct command of the respective regional armies and consider the
review of their deployment to operate them effectively and efficiently.
3. In order to provide for defense in the waters around Japan and security
of maritime traffic through effective prosecution of persistent ISR,
anti-submarine operations and mine countermeasure operations, to be
able to effectively engage in security cooperation with other countries,
MSDF will maintain 4 groups mainly consisting of 1 helicopter
destroyer (DDH) and 2 Aegis-equipped destroyers (DDG), and
maintain 2 groups consisting of new type of destroyers (FFM) with
improved multi- mission capabilities and minesweeping vessels. MSDF
will newly establish surface units composed of these destroyer units
and minesweeper units. In addition, MSDF will establish patrol vessel
units to enable enhanced steady-state ISR in the waters around Japan.
Furthermore, by introducing a test submarine, which the type will
be changed from an existing submarine, MSDF will work to achieve
greater efficiency in submarine operations and accelerate capability
improvement, thereby enhancing persistent ISR posture. In order to
effectively conduct underwater ISR and patrols and defense in the
waters around Japan, MSDF will continue to take measures necessary
to increase the number of submarines.
4. In order to enhance the air defense posture and operate effectively in
airspace around Japan including vast airspace on the Pacific side, ASDF
will reorganize 8 warning groups and 20 warning squadrons to 28
warning squadrons and establish 1 airborne early warning (AEW) wing
as part of air warning and control units, and take necessary measures to
establish 1 squadron of fighter aircraft units.
ASDF will disband 1 squadron of tactical reconnaissance unit with
the retirement of its reconnaissance aircraft (RF-4), and will establish
1 squadron of aerial refueling/transport units to enhance its aerial
refueling/transport function.
In order to be able to conduct information collection in areas
relatively remote from Japan and persistent airborne monitoring during
situations with heightened tensions, ASDF will establish 1 squadron of
unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) unit.
5. The total number of authorized GSDF personnel at the end of FY 2023
will be approximately 159,000, with approximately 151,000 being
active-duty personnel, and approximately 8,000 being reserve-ready
personnel. The authorized number of active- duty personnel of the
MSDF and ASDF through FY 2023 will be approximately at the same
levels as at the end of FY 2018.
During the period of the program, SDF will promote initiatives
to optimize organizations and missions such as reviewing the
existing organizations and missions whose importance has declined
and assigning personnel mainly to new domains, which are space,
cyberspace and electromagnetic spectrum.

**III. Major Programs regarding SDF’s Capabilities**
1. Priorities in Strengthening Capabilities Necessary for Cross-Domain
Operations
(1) Acquiring and Strengthening Capabilities in Space, Cyber and
Electromagnetic Domains
(A) Capabilities in Space Domain
In order to secure the stable use of space, SDF will build a
structure to conduct persistent space monitoring under an
appropriate role-sharing with related ministries and agencies
by such means as newly establishing space domain mission
unit and establishing a space situational awareness (SSA)
system and will also newly introduce space-based optical
telescopes and SSA laser ranging devices.
In order to further improve various capabilities that
leverage space domain including information-gathering,
communication and positioning capabilities, SDF will
continue to enhance information gathering capabilities through
the use of various space satellites equipped with diverse
sensors, and strengthen C4I capabilities by continuing to
develop a sophisticated X-Band satellite communications
system. SDF will also strive to secure redundancy by such
means as receiving multiple positioning satellite signals
including those of Quasi-Zenith Satellite System (QZSS) and
utilizing information gathering satellites (IGS) and commercial
satellites including micro ones. Additionally, in order to use
these capabilities continuously, SDF will conduct necessary
study and research, and newly introduce training devices to


study and train responses to the vulnerabilities of Japanese
satellites, and devices to grasp the state of electromagnetic
interference against Japanese satellites. By this strengthening
of the structure for grasping the situation, SDF will build the
capability to disrupt C4I of opponents in collaboration with the
electromagnetic domain.
In this regard, in addition to efforts to establish new job
categories and enhance education dedicated to the space
domain, SDF will actively leverage civilian technologies and
promote to enhance cooperation including the development of
human resources, with relevant agencies including the Japan
Aerospace Exploration Agency (JAXA) and with the U.S. and
other relevant countries, given that cutting-edge technology
and knowhow have been accumulated in these organizations.
(B) Capabilities in Cyber Domain
SDF aims to persistently ensure sufficient security against
cyber attack and acquire capability to disrupt, opponent’s
use of cyberspace in the event of attack against Japan. With
consideration to enhancing joint functions and efficient
resource allocations, SDF will establish the necessary
environment by such measures as expanding the structure
of cyber defense squadron and other units, enhancing the
resiliency of the C4 systems of SDF, strengthening capabilities
of information gathering, research and analysis, and developing
a practical training environment that can test SDF’s cyber
defense capability. In addition, SDF will strive to keep abreast
of the latest information including cyber-related risks, counter
measures and technological trends, through cooperation with
the private sector, and strategic talks, joint exercises and other
opportunities with the ally and other parties.
As the methods of cyber attack are becoming increasingly
sophisticated and complicated, securing personnel with
expertise on a continuing basis is essential. SDF plans to
develop personnel with strong cyber security expertise,
through efforts such as improving the in-house curriculum
for specialized education, increasing learning opportunities
at institutions of higher education at home and abroad, and
conducting personnel management that cultivates expertise. In
addition, SDF will strengthen the cyber defense capability by
utilizing superior outside expertise.
In order to enable a comprehensive response through a
whole-of-government approach in cyber domain, MOD/SDF
seeks to enhance close coordination with relevant ministries
and agencies, etc. by providing knowledge and MOD/SDF
personnel on a steady-state basis, and enhance training and
exercises.
(C) Capabilities in the Electromagnetic Domain
MOD/SDF will newly establish specialized sections in the
internal bureau and the Joint Staff respectively in order to
enhance the function to make policies pertaining to effective
and efficient use of electromagnetic spectrum in MOD/SDF
as well as to improve coordination with other ministries and
agencies.
In order to enhance information gathering and analysis
capabilities concerning electromagnetic spectrum and
develop an information sharing posture, SDF will promote
the procurement of radio wave information gathering aircraft
and ground-based SIGINT sensor, the upgrade of the Japan
Aerospace Defense Ground Environment (JADGE) system,
the connection of each SDF service’s systems including the
Defense Information Infrastructure (DII) and the improvement
of each SDF service’s data links.
In order to neutralize the radar and communications of
opponent attempting to invade Japan, SDF will proceed with
the procurement of fighters (F-35A) and network electronic
warfare devices, and the upgrade of fighters (F-15) and
utility aircraft (EP-3 and UP-3D). SDF will also swiftly
proceed with studies and R&D aimed at the procurement of
standoff electronic warfare aircraft, high-output electronic
warfare equipment, high-output microwave equipment and
electromagnetic pulse (EMP) ammunition.
(2) Enhancing Capabilities in Traditional Domains
(A) Capabilities in the Maritime and Air Domains
(i) Strengthening a Posture of Persistent ISR
In order to strengthen the posture to conduct persistent ISR
in broad areas at sea and in the air around Japan including
vast airspace on the Pacific side, and to detect any signs
of significant development at an early stage, SDF will
procure new type of destroyers with enhanced capabilities
to respond to a wide range of missions (FFM), submarines,
patrol vessels, fixed-wing patrol aircraft (P-1), patrol
helicopters (SH- 60K/K (upgraded version)) and shipborne UAVs, conduct service-extension work on existing


-----

destroyers, submarines, fixed-wing patrol aircraft (P-3C)
and patrol helicopters (SH-60J and SH-60K) and upgrade
the capabilities of fixed-wing patrol aircraft (P-1). In
this respect, SDF will strengthen the posture of persistent
ISR through increasing the number of the operating
days by introducing rational shifts of multiple crews and
coordination with patrol vessels to be newly introduced for
the new type of destroyers (FFM), and through increasing
the opportunities for operation of the submarine fleet on a
steady-state basis by introducing the test submarine, which
the type has been changed from existing submarines. In
addition, SDF will maintain a fully-prepared ISR posture
through procuring airborne early warning aircraft (E-2D)
and a long-endurance UAV (Global Hawk), upgrading the
capabilities of the existing airborne warning and control
systems (E-767), development of a new fixed air defense
radar, establishing 1 AEW wing as part of air warning and
control units as stated in II4, preparing an operating base
for mobile air defense radars on the islands on the Pacific
side and strengthening over- the-horizon radar capabilities.
(ii) Obtaining and Maintaining Air Superiority
SDF will strive for the comprehensive enhancement of air
defense capability in airspace around Japan including vast
air space on the Pacific side.
SDF will proceed replacing fighters that are not suitable
for modernization (F-15) by increasing the number of
fighters (F-35A) and will newly introduce fighters that are
capable of short take-off and vertical landing (hereinafter
referred to as “STOVL aircraft”) to enhance the flexibility
of fighter operations, as the number of air bases that allow
for conventional take-off and landing of fighters is limited.
In this regard, SDF will refurbish MSDF’s multi-function
helicopter carrier destroyers (Izumo class) after studying
operation of STOVL aircraft so that the operation where
necessary will be possible such as response to air attacks
in time of emergency, ISR, training and disaster response,
in order to further improve flexibility in fighter operations
while ensuring safety of SDF personnel and to improve
air operation capability particularly on the Pacific side of
Japan, where number of air bases is limited despite its
vast airspace. These destroyers shall continue to engage
as multi-function destroyers in a wide range of missions
after refurbishment, such as the defense of Japan and the
response to large- scale disasters. There will be no change
in the existing Government opinion concerning equipment
that cannot be possessed under the Constitution. In addition,
SDF will upgrade the capabilities of modernized fighter
aircraft (F-15) including the enhancement of electronic
warfare capabilities, mounting stand-off missiles and
increasing the number of mounted missiles. Furthermore,
SDF will upgrade the capabilities of fighter aircraft (F-2)
including the enhancement of network functions.
With regard to future fighter, SDF will procure new
fighters that are capable of playing a central role in future
networked warfare before the retirement of the fighter
aircraft (F-2). MOD/SDF will promote necessary research
and launch a Japan-led development project at an early

organically coordinating such training and exercises that utilize
training environments in Japan and abroad.
Seeking to respond to various situations with a whole-ofgovernment approach, coordination with relevant agencies including
police, firefighters, and the Japan Coast Guard will be reinforced.
SDF will also actively utilize the opportunities presented by the joint
training and exercises of SDF and Japan-U.S. bilateral training and


exercises as a way not only for considering and verifying plans for
the actual operations of SDF, but also for actively considering and
verifying comprehensive issues including civil protection.

(2) Medical Care
SDF will enhance its medical functions to keep SDF personnel’s
vitality and enhance their ability to deal with various situations and
engage in a diverse range of missions at home and abroad.
In order to respond to various situations, SDF will strive to
enhance the capacity to rapidly deploy medical bases and conduct
Damage Control Surgery (DCS) to stabilize the symptoms of
patients, and the capacity to manage patients being sent back as part
of strengthening the system to seamlessly cover the entire stretch
between the frontline and final medical evacuation destinations
including the perspective of joint operations. In this regard, SDF
will establish a system to jointly possess patient information from
the frontline to final destinations. SDF will also strive to standardize
medical supplies for the sake of interoperability and to stockpile
necessary supplies. Furthermore, in order to transport patients
safely, SDF will take necessary measures to introduce armored
ambulances. Taking conditions and characteristics of each region
into account, SDF will focus on strengthening medical functions of
SDF in Japan’s southwestern region.
In order to conduct the control and coordination regarding
medical operations of SDF on a steady-state basis, SDF will strive
to strengthen the organization of the Joint Staff. SDF will establish
an efficient and high-quality medical care regime through further
endeavors including upgrading of SDF hospitals into medical
hubs with enhanced functions. Furthermore, SDF will proceed to
improve the management of the National Defense Medical College,
enhance its research functions and strive to secure high-quality
talents, as well as striving to enrich the clinical experience of
medical officers to better secure the number of medical officers, and
promoting the appointment of SDF Reserve Personnel (physicians).
In addition, MOD/SDF will proceed with the establishment of
hygienic education and training foundations common to each SDF
service that are necessary to improve medical care capabilities for
combat injuries and the requisite posture for various international
cooperation including capacity building assistance.
(3) Collaboration with Local Communities
MOD/SDF will constantly and actively engage in public relations
activities regarding defense policies and activities. Upon fielding
units and equipment of SDF or U.S. Forces in Japan and conducting
training and exercises, MOD/SDF will make careful, detailed
coordination to meet desires and conditions of local communities,
while sufficiently fulfilling accountability. At the same time, MOD/
SDF will continue to promote various impact alleviation measures
including sound insulation projects at residences. MOD/SDF
will further strengthen collaboration with relevant organizations
including local governments, police and fire departments in order to
enable SDF to swiftly and securely conduct its activities in response
to various situations.
In certain regions, presence of SDF units makes substantial
contributions to maintenance and revitalization of local
communities. There are also cases where SDF’s emergency
patient transport is supporting community medicine. In light of
this, MOD/SDF will give due considerations to local conditions
and characteristics upon reorganization of operation units as well
as placement of SDF garrisons and bases. MOD/SDF will also
promote various measures that contribute to the local community
by such means as striving to secure opportunities for local small
and medium enterprises to receive contract orders based on the
contracting policy of the nation, etc., concerning small and medium
enterprises while also being mindful of efficiency.
(4) Intellectual Base
MOD/SDF will contribute to the promotion of national security
education through such means as dispatching instructors to
educational institutions and holding public symposiums. In
addition, MOD/SDF will provide efficient and highly trustworthy
information to increase public access to the research results
regarding security. Moreover, MOD/SDF will promote various
measures to improve the capabilities for providing information
including that in foreign languages, the further utilization of
increasingly diversified social networks, and MOD/SDF will also
expand networks and institutional collaboration with research and
education organizations, and think-tanks in Japan and abroad in
order to further strengthen the research system of MOD/SDF with
the National Institute for Defense Studies playing central roles.
Furthermore, MOD/SDF will contribute to policy development
through timely and appropriate supply of high-quality research
results, based upon expertise and research capabilities, to the policy
development departments.

**IV. Quantities of Major Procurement**
The Annex Table shows details of the quantities of major procurement
described in Section III.

**V. Expenditures**
1. The expenditure target for the implementation of the defense capability
build-up described in this program amount to approximately ¥27,470
billion in FY 2018 prices.
2. For the duration of this program, in harmony with other measures
taken by the Government, substantive funds will be secured by means
of thoroughgoing greater efficiency and streamlining in defense force
development, suspending the use of equipment whose importance has
decreased, reviewing or discontinuing projects of low cost-effectiveness,
optimizing equipment procurement through cost management/
suppression and long-term contracts and securing other revenue. The
annual defense budgets target for the implementation of this program
is expected to be around approximately ¥25,500 billion over the next
five years. In order to adapt to increasingly rapid changes in the security
environment, Japan must strengthen its defense capability at speeds that
are fundamentally different from the past. Moreover, to achieve rapid
procurement of defense equipment, Japan must pursue flexible and


swift project management, and the budgetary process for each fiscal
year which will be conducted taking into account the economic and
fiscal conditions among other budgets.
3. The amount of expenses based on contracts (material expenses) to be
newly concluded to implement this program will be allocated within the
ceiling of approximately ¥17,170 billion in FY 2018 prices (excluding
the amount corresponding to payments outside of the program period
for contracts that contribute to improving project efficiency such as
maintenance), and the future obligation shall be managed appropriately.
4. This program will be reviewed after three years as necessary, with
consideration to such factors at home and abroad as the international
security environment, trends in technological standards including
information communication technology, and fiscal conditions.

**VI. Other**
While maintaining U.S. Forces deterrence, Japan will steadily implement
specific measures stipulated in “United States-Japan Roadmap for
Realignment Implementation” and other SCC documents and SACO
(Special Action Committee on Okinawa) related programs to mitigate the
impact on local communities, including those in Okinawa.

**Reference 14  Outline of Cabinet Decision and Legislation Development**

|Items of the Cabinet Decision|Outline|Legislation Development|
|---|---|---|
|1. Response to an Infringement that Does Not Amount to an Armed Attack|• Under the basic policy that relevant agencies including the police and Japan Coast Guard are to respond in close cooperation in accordance with their respective duties and authorities, the Government will further strengthen necessary measures in all areas, including enhancing the respective agency’s response capabilities and strengthening collaboration among agencies. In cases of responding to a situation where police forces are not present nearby or police agencies cannot respond immediately, the Government will consider measures for issuing orders swiftly and accelerating procedures for public security operations or maritime security operations. • The Government will develop legislation that enables the SDF to carry out very passive and limited “use of weapons” to the minimum extent necessary to protect weapons and other equipment of the units of the U.S. and other countries’ Armed Forces that are, in cooperation with the SDF, currently engaged in activities that contribute to the defense of Japan (including joint exercises), in line with the provisions of Article 95 of the Self-Defense Forces Law.|* Acceleration of procedures to issue orders for public security operations/maritime security operations * Revision of the Self-Defense Forces Law (Protection of weapons and other equipment of the units of the U.S. and other countries’ Armed Forces)|
|2. Further Contributions to the Peace and Stability of the International Community|• So-called Logistics Support and “Integration with the Use of Force” (*1) ➢ The Government is of the recognition that Japan’s support activities such as supply and transportation conducted at a place which is not “the scene where combat activities are actually being conducted” by a foreign country are not regarded as “Integration with the use of force” of that country. Based on that recognition, the Government will proceed with developing legislation which enables necessary support activities for the armed forces of foreign countries engaging in activities for ensuring Japan’s security or for the peace and stability of the international community. ➢ Japan does not conduct support activities in “the scene where combat activities are actually being conducted” by armed forces of a foreign country to which Japan provides support. ➢ Japan will immediately pause or cease support activities if the place where Japan is conducting support activities becomes “the scene where combat operations are actually being conducted” due to changes in the situation. • Use of Weapons Associated with International Peace Cooperation Activities Based on the following positions, the Government will proceed with developing legislation in order to enable the SDF’s use of weapons associated with so-called “kaketsuke-keigo” (coming to the protection of individuals related to operations in response to urgent requests) and the “use of weapons for the purpose of execution of missions” in international peace cooperation activities that do not involve the “use of force,” including U.N. peacekeeping operations, as well as police-like activities that do not involve the “use of force,” including the rescuing of Japanese nationals with the consent from the territorial State. ➢ As for U.N. peacekeeping operations, etc., under the framework of the Five Principles for PKOs, “a quasi-state organization” (*2) other than parties to the conflict who have given consent of acceptance is, in principle, not expected to appear as an adversary. ➢ When the SDF units conduct police-like activities that do not involve “use of force” including the rescuing of Japanese nationals in a foreign country based on the consent of the territorial State’s Government, it is natural that the activities be conducted in the area within which the consent of the territorial State’s Government is valid, i.e. the area within which its authority is maintained. This means that no “quasi-state organization” exists in that area. ➢ The Cabinet will make a decision on whether the consent of acceptance is stably maintained and whether the area within which the consent of the territorial State’s Government is valid, etc., based on deliberations, etc., at the National Security Council.|* The Act Concerning the Measures for the Peace and Security of Japan in Situations That Will Have an Important Influence on Japan’s Peace and Security (Revision of the Act Concerning the Measures for the Peace and Security of Japan in Situations in Areas Surrounding Japan), Revision of the Ship Inspection Operations Act, Enactment of the International Peace Support Act * Revision of the International Peace Cooperation Act, revision of the Self- Defense Forces Law (Rescue of measures for Japanese nationals overseas)|
|3. Measures for Self- Defense Permitted under Article 9 of the Constitution|• The Government understands that not only when an armed attack against Japan occurs but also when an armed attack against a foreign country that is in a close relationship with Japan occurs and as a result threatens Japan’s survival and poses a clear danger to fundamentally overturn people’s right to life, liberty and pursuit of happiness, and when there is no other appropriate means available to repel the attack and ensure Japan’s survival and protect its people, use of force to the minimum extent necessary should be interpreted to be permitted under the Constitution as measures for self-defense in accordance with the basic logic of the Government’s view to date. • The aforementioned “use of force” permitted under the Constitution could have, under international law, a basis on the right of collective self-defense. Although this “use of force” includes that which is triggered by an armed attack occurring against a foreign country, it is permitted under the Constitution only when it is taken as a measure for self- defense which is inevitable for ensuring Japan’s survival and protecting its people, in other words for defending Japan. • The Government will stipulate in the draft legislation that the prior approval of the Diet is in principle required upon issuing orders for operations to the SDF for carrying out “use of force” permitted under the Constitution when an armed attack occurs not against Japan but against a foreign country, in the same manner as the procedures related to defense operations stipulated in the current laws and regulations.|* Revision of Legislation for Responses to Armed Attack Situations, revision of the Self-Defense Forces Law (The provision concerning defense operations) etc.|



Notes: 1. As for Japan’s support activities, however, legal frameworks limiting the area of such activities to “rear area” or so-called “non-combat area,” etc., have been established in past legislations to
ensure that the issue of “integration with the use of force” (forming an “integral part” of the use of force) does not arise, in relation to Article 9 of the Constitution. This is intended to avoid Japan
from being legally evaluated as carrying out by itself the “use of force” which is not permitted under the Constitution because its support activities would form an “integral part” of the use of
force (“integration with the use of force”) by other countries.
2. Use of weapons associated with so-called “kaketsuke-keigo” (coming to the aid of geographically distant units or personnel under attack) or “use of weapons for the purpose of the execution
of missions” could constitute the “use of force” prohibited by Article 9 of the Constitution if such use of weapons is directed against “a state or a quasi-state organization.”

**Reference 17  MOD’s final statement regarding the incident of an ROK**
**naval vessel directing its fire-control radar at an MSDF**
**patrol aircraft (Provisional Translation)**

**Introduction**
The Ministry of Defense (MOD) has made endeavors in the past for close
communication to take place between the defense authorities of Japan and
the Republic of Korea (ROK), and in this spirit, regarding the current issue
concerning the fire-control radar irradiation by an ROK destroyer, a series
of consultations have been held between Japan and the ROK. However, it is
extremely regrettable that even today, the difference between the respective
understandings regarding major issues, including whether or not there was an
irradiation of fire-control radar, is not yet resolved.
The MOD takes this incident seriously, and in light of firmly seeking
for prevention of recurrence, has decided to summarize and make publicly
available the objective facts that are possessed by the Japanese side.
We hope that this announcement will lead to the prevention of similar
incidents in the future.

**1. Regarding the fire-control radar irradiation**
Because Japan is surrounded by wide sea space, in order to respond to a
variety of contingencies in a timely and appropriate manner, and to assure
the protection of the lives and property of the people as well as territorial
land, water and airspace, during peacetime, the MOD is engaged in persistent
intelligence collection and warning and surveillance of foreign vessels
conducting activities in Japan’s surrounding waters.
As shown in the footage released by the MOD on December 28, 2018, on
December 20, around 3PM, an MSDF P-1 patrol aircraft was flying within
Japan’s exclusive economic zone (EEZ) in the Sea of Japan as part of ordinary
intelligence collection and warningandsurveillance activities whenit observed
an ROKdestroyer andan ROKpatrol and rescue vessel. While photographing
the said vessels, the P-1 was suddenly irradiated by a fire-control radar from
the ROK destroyer. The MSDF P-1 immediately took actions to ensure safety.
Fire-control radars are directed at its target immediately before firing,
and to aim it at foreign aircrafts without a rational reason is an extremely
hazardous act that may cause unintended consequences.
According to CUES (Code for Unplanned Encounters at Sea), a code
adopted in 2014 by navies from 21 countries including Japan and the ROK,
aiming fire control radars is considered a simulation of attack, and is stipulated
as an action a commander might avoid


In response to the occurrence of a serious incident of such nature, the
MOD lodged a strong protest and requested the prevention of recurrence
to the ROK. However, not only did the ROK deny the fact this incident
occurred, their actions regarding the incident entirely focus on demanding
Japan to “stop distorting facts” and “apologize for conducting a threateningly
low-altitude flight”.
Upon careful and meticulous analysis by the MOD’s specialized unit of
the frequency, intensity, waveform, etc. of the radar waves directed at the
MSDF P-1, the MOD has confirmed that the P-1 was continuously irradiated
for a certain period, multiple times by the fire-control radar (STIR-180) of the
ROK destroyer that was being photographed. The STIR-180 was not mounted
on the patrol and rescue vessel that was nearby at the time, and the fact the
ROK destroyer directed its radar is clear from the footage released by the
MOD on December 28, 2018.
The MOD has decided publicly disclose at the Ministry’s website, upon
processing for information security, the data of the radar waves converted to
sound that the P-1 patrol aircraft crew heard inflight, as further evidence of the
irradiation of the fire-control radar.
In general, fire-control radars continuously direct radar waves to its
target in order to obtain the target’s location, speed etc. to fire missiles and
ammunition with precision. The data collected from the fire-control radar,
such as wave forms, is clearly different from that of a surface search radar,
which searches/detects targets in surrounding areas by emitting radar waves
while rotating its head. Therefore, by analyzing the emitted radio waves, it
is possible to determine its type and source of emission. The radio waves
directed at the MSDF P-1 had shown characteristics unique to that of firecontrol radars.
Although it is apparent from the result of MOD’s analysis that this radar
wave was emitted by the ROK destroyer being photographed by the MSDF
P-1, for the objective and neutral determination of these facts, it is necessary
that a comprehensive assessment is made upon comparison of Japan’s data
regarding the radar waves it has detected, and the ROK’sdataregardingthedet
ailedcapabilityofthefire-controlradarequippedonthe ROK destroyer, based on
the principle of reciprocity.
In this light, at the working-level meeting held on January 14, 2019, the
MOD proposed a joint verification of data based on the principle of reciprocity,
by comparing the factual evidence of the incident such as the detected radar
waves and its sound conversion, to the ROK radar’s capabilities and record
of use. However, this proposal was rejected. The MOD had made a proposal
of the same intent during the working-level meeting held on December 27,


-----

2018. In addition, the MOD also brought the data of the sound conversion of
the detected radar waves, as evidence to contribute to the verification of facts,
to the meeting on January 14 and proposed to have the ROK listen to it there,
but this proposal was also rejected.
On the following day, January 15, the spokesperson of the ROK’s Ministry
of National Defense denounced the MOD’s proposals as “extremely rude”, an
expression that is diplomatically rare, and, in violation of the agreement made
between Japan and the ROK ahead of the meeting, one-sidedly disclosed
information contrary to facts regarding the content of the meeting. These
comments by the ROK spokesperson undermine the relationship of mutual
trust and hinder the candid exchange of views. It is extremely regrettable
that such actions were taken, and on the 16th, the MOD firmly requested that
such actions never recur. However, the ROK has failed to provide a sincere
response.
Taking into account the series of actions by the ROK and the fact that the
ROK’s claims have lacked both consistency and credibility, there is no choice
but to conclude that the ROK has been repeating claims that by all means
differ from truth.
In such a situation, an objective and neutral determination of facts based
on the principle of reciprocity must be deemed difficult, and it is unlikely
that the truth will ever be made clear even if working-level meetings were
to continue to be held. The MOD once again strongly protests against the
ROK destroyer’s fire-control radar irradiation, and strongly urges the ROK to
accept that this incident occurred and conduct thorough measures to prevent
the recurrence of such event.

**2. Regarding other claims made by the ROK**
(1) Regarding the flight by the MSDF P-1
The ROK claims that the MSDF P-1 conducted “a threateningly
low-altitude flight” in the vicinity of a ROK destroyer conducting a
“humanitarian rescue mission”, and is demanding an apology.
There is no international law that directly regulates the minimum
safety altitude for military aircrafts, but in order to ensure safety, the
MSDF operates under Japan’s domestic law that conforms to the
Convention on International Civil Aviation, and did not conduct any
flight that may threaten the ROK destroyer. It is our understanding that
normal operations by the U.S. Forces and NATO are carried out under
similar standards.
In fact, as apparent from the footage released by the MOD
on December 28 and the MSDF P-1’s track chart, the MSDF P-1
maintained a sufficiently safe altitude (approx. 150m) and distance
(approx. 500m) from the ROK destroyer even at its closest, and did
not conduct flight that may interrupt the ROK destroyer’s activities. In
addition, because the ROK destroyer did not respond to the P-1’s call
outs by radio communication, the MSDF P-1 was unable to recognize
that the ROK was conducting rescue activities.
No evidence to support the ROK’s claim can be found in the tensecond footage released by the ROK of what seems to be the MSDF
P-1 patrol aircraft filmed from the ROKpatroland rescue vessel, and
noother objective evidence to support the ROK’s claim that the MSDF
P-1 conducted “a threateningly low-altitude flight” has been presented.
Even prior to this incident, the MSDF has conducted similar flights
and has photographed vessels when observing not only Korean but
other foreign vessels during its intelligence collection and warning and
surveillance activities. Since April 2018, the MSDF has photographed
the exact same ROK destroyer “Gwanggaeto-daewang” destroyer three
times (April 27, April 28 and August 23), but the ROK did not express
its concern regarding these flights.
The MOD had requested additional objective evidence to support
the ROK’s claim at the working-level meetings, but the ROK has failed
to provide such evidence, and has repeatedly responded with claims
that entirely lack in objectivity, such as “if the subject of the threat feels
threatened, it is then a threat”.
For these reasons, the MOD has concluded that the ROK’s claim
lacks both persuasiveness and support from factual evidence, and was
made to dilute other important issues regarding the fire-control radar
incident.

(2) Regarding communication conditions
In general, naval vessel crew will call out by radio communication
when feeling threat, but the ROK destroyer, despite seeing the MSDF
P-1 aircraft’s flight as a problem, had not taken measures by any means
to call out to the P-1 about its concern.
In addition, after being irradiated by the fire-control radar, the
MSDF P-1 patrol aircraft had called out using three frequencies in
international VHF (156.8MHz) and emergency frequencies (121.5MHz
and 243MHz), but there was no response at all from the ROK destroyer.
Regarding this issue, the ROK has explained that the destroyer did
not respond because the communication condition on site was poor,


and they were unable to catch most of the call outs from the aircraft
and thought they heard the phrase “KOREA COAST”. In addition, the
ROK also explained that the communication equipment on board was
not tuned to be able to hear one of the three frequencies.
However, the weather conditions on site that day was sunny with
very few clouds, and communication conditions were extremely
good. In addition, the MSDF P-1 used the same radio communication
equipment (it has been confirmed that this equipment was operating
normally before, during, and after flight) used to call out to the ROK
destroyer tocommunicatewithon-landstationsin Saitama Prefecture,
andithasalsobeenconfirmed that an ASDF training aircraft flying at a
location approximately 240 km away from the P- 1 heard the call out
made by the P-1 to the ROK destroyer.
It is improbable under normal circumstances that radio
communication could not be clearly received in such good
communication conditions, and in the footage released by the ROK,
the call out from the P-1 to the ROK destroyer can be clearly heard
(“KOREAN SOUTH NAVAL SHIP, HULL NUMBER 971, THIS
IS JAPAN NAVY.”) Considering this point, at the working-level
meetingon January 14, the ROKexplained for the first time that, upon
repeated inspection of the call out from the MSDF P-1 patrol aircraft,
it was later found that the communication personnel had misheard the
radio communication. Prior to this, the ROK had never disclosed this
information in its press conferences and had only explained that the
destroyer did not respond because they heard “KOREACOAST”.
The MOD strongly calls for the ROK to take measures to improve
communication between Japan-ROK defense authorities on site, such
as conducting appropriate communication to JSDF aircrafts, improving
conditions of communication reception, and conducting education/
training to communication personnel, so that such incidents never recur.

**3. Path forward**
For the above reasons, the MOD once again strongly protests against the
ROK destroyer’s fire-control radar irradiation, and strongly urges the ROK to
accept that this incident occurred and conduct thorough measures to prevent
its recurrence.
At the same time, given that the ROK refuses to conduct an objective
and neutral determination of facts based on the principle of reciprocity, and
thus it is unlikely that the truth will ever be made clear even if working-level
meetings were to continue, the MOD deems that it has become difficult to
continue to hold consultations with the  ROK regarding this matter.
That being said, our stance remains unchanged in that the Japan-ROK
and Japan-ROK-U.S defense cooperation is extremely important, and is
indispensable in confronting security challenges such as the nuclear and
missile issue in North Korea and maintaining the stability of the security
environment in East Asia. We hope that this announcement will lead to the
prevention of similar incidents in the future, and we will continue to make
sincere efforts towards continuous Japan-ROK and Japan-ROK-U.S defense
cooperation.

**Reference 22 United States Japan Roadmap for Realignment**
**Implementation**

(Washington, DC, May 1, 2006)
**Overview**
On October 29, 2005, the U.S.–Japan Security Consultative Committee
(SCC) members approved recommendations for realignment of U.S. forces in
Japan and related Japan Self-Defense Forces (SDF) in their document, “U.S.–
Japan Alliance: Transformation and Realignment for the Future.” In that
document, the SCC members directed their respective staffs “to finalize these
specific and interrelated initiatives and develop plans, including concrete
implementation schedules no later than March 2006.” This work has been
completed and is reflected in this document.
**Finalization of Realignment Initiatives**
The individual realignment initiatives form a coherent package. When
implemented, these realignments will ensure a life-of-the-alliance presence
for U.S. forces in Japan.
The construction and other costs for facility development in the
implementation of these initiatives will be borne by the Government of Japan
(GOJ) unless otherwise specified. The U.S. Government (USG) will bear
the operational costs that arise from implementation of these initiatives. The
two Governments will finance their realignment associated costs consistent
with their commitments in the October 29, 2005 SCC document to maintain
deterrence and capabilities while reducing burdens on local communities.
**Key Implementation Details**
1. Realignment on Okinawa
(a) Futenma Replacement Facility (FRF)
 The United States and Japan will locate the FRF in a configuration
that combines the Henoko-saki and adjacent water areas of Oura
and Henoko Bays, including two runways aligned in a “V”-shape,
each runway having a length of 1,600 meters plus two 100-meter
overruns. The length of each runway portion of the facility is 1,800
meters, exclusive of seawalls (see attached concept plan dated April
28, 2006). This facility ensures agreed operational capabilities while
addressing issues of safety, noise, and environmental impacts.
 In order to locate the FRF, inclusive of agreed support facilities, in
the Camp Schwab area, necessary adjustments will be made, such
as reconfiguration of Camp Schwab facilities and adjacent water
surface areas.
 Construction of the FRF is targeted for completion by 2014.
 Relocation to the FRF will occur when the facility is fully
operationally capable.
 Facility improvements for contingency use at ASDF bases at
Nyutabaru and Tsuiki related to replacement of Marine Corps Air
Station (MCAS) Futenma capabilities will be made, as necessary,
after conducting site surveys and before MCAS Futenma is
returned.
 Requirements for improved contingency use of civilian facilities
will be examined in the context of bilateral contingency planning,
and appropriate arrangements will be made in order to realize the
return of MCAS Futenma.
 In principle, the construction method for the FRF will be landfill.
 The USG does not intend to operate fighter aircraft from this
facility.
(b) Force Reductions and Relocation to Guam
 Approximately 8,000 III Marine Expeditionary Force (MEF)
personnel and their approximately 9,000 dependents will relocate
from Okinawa to Guam by 2014, in a manner that maintains unit
integrity. Units to relocate will include: III MEF Command Element,
3rd Marine Division Headquarters, 3rd Marine Logistics Group
(formerly known as Force Service Support Group) Headquarters,
1st Marine Air Wing Headquarters, and 12th Marine Regiment
Headquarters.
 The affected units will relocate from such facilities as Camp
Courtney, Camp Hansen, MCAS Futenma, Camp Zukeran, and
Makiminato Service Area.
 The U.S. Marine Corps (USMC) forces remaining on Okinawa
will consist of Marine Air-Ground Task Force elements, such as
command, ground, aviation, and combat service support, as well as
a base support capability.
 Of the estimated $10.27 billion cost of the facilities and
infrastructure development costs for the III MEF relocation to
Guam, Japan will provide $6.09 billion (in U.S. FY2008 dollars),
including $2.8 billion in direct cash contributions, to develop
facilities and infrastructure on Guam to enable the III MEF
relocation, recognizing the strong desire of Okinawa residents that
such force relocation be realized rapidly. The United States will
fund the remainder of the facilities and infrastructure development
costs for the relocation to Guam estimated in U.S. FY2008 dollars
at $3.18 billion in fiscal spending plus approximately $1 billion for
a road.
(c) Land Returns and Shared Use of Facilities
 F ll i th l ti t th FRF th t f MCAS F t


and the transfer of III MEF personnel to Guam, the remaining
facilities and areas on Okinawa will be consolidated, thereby
enabling the return of significant land areas south of Kadena Air
Base.
 Both sides will develop a detailed consolidation plan by March
2007. In this plan, total or partial return of the following six
candidate facilities will be examined:
 Camp Kuwae: Total return.
 Camp Zukeran: Partial return and consolidation of remaining
facilities and infrastructure to the extent possible.
 MCAS Futenma: Total return (see FRF section above).
 Makiminato Service Area: Total return.
 aha Port: Total return (relocated to the new facilities, including
additional staging constructed at Urasoe).
 Army POL Depot Kuwae Tank Farm No. 1: Total return.
 All functions and capabilities that are resident in facilities
designated for return, and that are required by forces remaining in
Okinawa, will be relocated within Okinawa. These relocations will
occur before the return of designated facilities.
 While emphasizing the importance of steady implementation of the
recommendations of the Special Action Committee on Okinawa
(SACO) Final Report, the SACO relocation and return initiatives
may need to be reevaluated.
 Camp Hansen will be used for GSDF training. Shared use that
requires no facility improvements will be possible from 2006.
 ASDF will use Kadena Air Base for bilateral training with U.S.
forces, taking into account noise impacts on local communities.
(d) Relationships among Initiatives
 Within the overall package, the Okinawa-related realignment
initiatives are interconnected.
 Specifically, consolidation and land returns south of Kadena depend
on completing the relocation of III MEF personnel and dependents
from Okinawa to Guam.
 The III MEF relocation from Okinawa to Guam is dependent on:
(1) tangible progress toward completion of the FRF, and (2) Japan’s
financial contributions to fund development of required facilities
and infrastructure on Guam.
2. Improvement of U.S. Army Command and Control Capability
 U.S. Army command and control structure at Camp Zama will be
transformed by U.S. FY2008. The headquarters of the GSDF Central
Readiness Force subsequently will arrive at Camp Zama by Japan
FY2012; SDF helicopters will have access to Kastner Heliport on Camp
Zama.
 Along with the transformation of Army headquarters in Japan, a battle
command training center and other support facilities will be constructed
within Sagami General Depot (SGD) using U.S. funding.
 In relation to this transformation, the following measures for efficient
and effective use of Camp Zama and SGD will be implemented.
 Some portions of land at SGD will be returned for local
redevelopment (approximately 15 hectares (ha)) and for road and
underground rail (approximately 2ha). Affected housing units will
be relocated to Sagamihara Housing Area.
 A specified area of open space in the northwest section of SGD
(approximately 35ha) will be provided for local use when not
required for contingency or training purposes.
 Portions of the Chapel Hill housing area of Camp Zama (1.1ha)
will be returned to the GOJ following relocation of affected housing
units within Camp Zama. Further discussions on possible additional
land returns at Chapel Hill will occur as appropriate.
3. Yokota Air Base and Airspace
 ASDF Air Defense Command (ADC) and relevant units will relocate
to Yokota Air Base in Japan FY2010. A bilateral master plan for base
use will be developed to accommodate facility and infrastructure
requirements.
 A bilateral, joint operations coordination center (BJOCC), established
at Yokota Air Base, will include a collocated air and missile defense
coordination function. The USG and GOJ will fund their own required
equipment and systems, respectively, while both sides will coordinate
appropriate funding of shared use equipment and systems.
 The following measures will be pursued to facilitate movement of
civilian aircraft through Yokota airspace while satisfying military
operational requirements.
 Establish a program in Japan FY2006 to inform commercial
aviation entities of existing procedures to transit Yokota airspace.
 Return portions of Yokota airspace to Japanese control by
September 2008; specific portions will be identified by October
2006.
 Develop procedures in Japan FY2006 for temporary transfers of air
traffic control responsibility to Japanese authorities for portions of
Yokota airspace, when not required for military purposes.
 Study the conditions required for the possible return of the entire
Yokota airspace as part of a comprehensive study of options for
related airspace reconfigurations and changes in air traffic control

**Reference 24 The Guidelines for Japan-U.S. Defense Cooperation**

(April 27, 2015)
**I. Defense Cooperation and the Aim of the Guidelines**
In order to ensure Japan’s peace and security under any circumstances,
from peacetime to contingencies, and to promote a stable, peaceful, and
prosperous Asia-Pacific region and beyond, bilateral security and defense
cooperation will emphasize:

-  seamless, robust, flexible, and effective bilateral responses;

-  synergy across the two governments’ national security policies;

-  a whole-of-government Alliance approach;

-  cooperation with regional and other partners, as well as international
organizations; and

-  the global nature of the Japan U S Alliance


-----

The two governments will continuously enhance the Japan-U.S.
Alliance. Each government will maintain its individual defense posture
based on its national security policy. Japan will possess defense capability
on the basis of the “National Security Strategy” and the “National Defense
Program Guidelines.” The United States will continue to extend deterrence
to Japan through the full range of capabilities, including U.S. nuclear
forces. The United States also will continue to forward deploy combatready forces in the Asia-Pacific region and maintain the ability to reinforce
those forces rapidly.
The Guidelines for Japan-U.S. Defense Cooperation (“the Guidelines”)
provide the general framework and policy direction for the roles and
missions of Japan and the United States, as well as ways of cooperation
and coordination, with a view to improving the effectiveness of bilateral
security and defense cooperation. In this way, the Guidelines advance
peace and security, deter conflict, secure the basis for economic prosperity,
and promote domestic and international understanding of the significance
of the Japan-U.S. Alliance.
**II. Basic Premises and Principles**
The Guidelines, as well as actions and activities under the Guidelines, are
and will be consistent with the following basic premises and principles.
A. The rights and obligations under the Treaty of Mutual Cooperation
and Security between Japan and the United States of America (the
Japan-U.S. Security Treaty) and its related arrangements, as well as
the fundamental framework of the Japan-U.S. Alliance, will remain
unchanged.
B. All actions and activities undertaken by Japan and the United States
under the Guidelines will be consistent with international law, including
the Charter of the United Nations and its provisions regarding the
peaceful settlement of disputes and sovereign equality of States, as well
as other relevant international agreements.
C. All actions and activities undertaken by Japan and the United States
will be in accordance with their respective constitutions, laws, and
regulations then in effect, and basic positions on national security
policy. Japan will conduct actions and activities in accordance with
its basic positions, such as the maintenance of its exclusively national
defense-oriented policy and its three non-nuclear principles.
D. The Guidelines do not obligate either government to take legislative,
budgetary, administrative, or other measures, nor do the Guidelines
create legal rights or obligations for either government. Since the
objective of the Guidelines, however, is to establish an effective
framework for bilateral cooperation, the two governments are expected
to reflect in an appropriate way the results of these efforts, based on
their own judgment, in their specific policies and measures.
**III. Strengthened Alliance Coordination**
Effective bilateral cooperation under the Guidelines will require the two
governments to conduct close, consultative dialogue and sound policy and
operational coordination from peacetime to contingencies.
The two governments must be well informed and coordinate at multiple
levels to ensure successful bilateral security and defense cooperation. To
that end, the two governments will take advantage of all available channels
to enhance information sharing and to ensure seamless and effective wholeof-government Alliance coordination that includes all relevant agencies.
For this purpose, the two governments will establish a new, standing
Alliance Coordination Mechanism, enhance operational coordination, and
strengthen bilateral planning.
A. Alliance Coordination Mechanism
Persistent and emerging threats can have a serious and immediate
impact on the peace and security of Japan and the United States. In
order to address seamlessly and effectively any situation that affects
Japan’s peace and security or any other situation that may require
an Alliance response, the two governments will utilize the Alliance
Coordination Mechanism. This mechanism will strengthen policy and
operational coordination related to activities conducted by the SelfDefense Forces and the United States Armed Forces in all phases from
peacetime to contingencies. This mechanism also will contribute to
timely information sharing as well as the development and maintenance
of common situational awareness. To ensure effective coordination, the
two governments will establish necessary procedures and infrastructure
(including facilities as well as information and communication systems)
and conduct regular training and exercises.
The two governments will tailor to the situation the procedures for
coordination as well as the exact composition of participating agencies
within the Alliance Coordination Mechanism structure. As part of these
procedures, contact information will be shared and maintained from
peacetime.
B. Enhanced Operational Coordination
Enhanced bilateral operational coordination for flexible and responsive
command and control is a core capability of critical importance to Japan
and the United States. In this context, the two governments recognize
the continued importance of collocating operational coordination
functions to strengthen cooperation between the Self-Defense Forces
and the United States Armed Forces.
The Self-Defense Forces and the United States Armed Forces


will exchange personnel to ensure robust information sharing, to
facilitate coordination from peacetime to contingencies, and to support
international activities. The Self-Defense Forces and the United States
Armed Forces, in close cooperation and coordination, will take action
through their respective chains-of-command.
C. Bilateral Planning
The two governments will continue to develop and update bilateral plans
to ensure smooth and effective execution of coordinated operations by
the Self-Defense Forces and the United States Armed Forces. To ensure
the effectiveness of the plans and the ability to make flexible, timely,
and appropriate responses, the two governments will exchange relevant
information, including identifying operational and logistic support
requirements and sources in advance, as appropriate.
The two governments will conduct bilateral planning in peacetime
for contingencies relevant to Japan’s peace and security through an
upgraded Bilateral Planning Mechanism, which includes relevant
agencies of the respective governments. Bilateral plans will be
developed with input from relevant agencies, as appropriate. The
Security Consultative Committee (SCC) will continue to be responsible
for presenting directions, validating the progress of the planning under
the mechanism, and issuing directives as necessary. The SCC will be
assisted by an appropriate subordinate body.
Bilateral plans are to be reflected appropriately in the plans of both
governments.
**IV. Seamlessly Ensuring Japan’s Peace and Security**
Persistent and emerging threats can have a serious and immediate
impact on Japan’s peace and security. In this increasingly complex
security environment, the two governments will take measures to ensure
Japan’s peace and security in all phases, seamlessly, from peacetime to
contingencies, including situations when an armed attack against Japan
is not involved. In this context, the two governments also will promote
further cooperation with partners.
The two governments recognize that these measures need to be taken
based on flexible, timely, and effective bilateral coordination tailored to
each situation and that interagency coordination is essential for appropriate
Alliance responses. Therefore, the two governments will utilize the wholeof-government Alliance Coordination Mechanism, as appropriate, to:

-  assess the situation;

-  share information; and

-  develop ways to implement the appropriate Alliance response, including
flexible deterrent options, as well as actions aimed at de-escalation.
To support these bilateral efforts, the two governments also will
coordinate strategic messaging through appropriate channels on issues that
could potentially affect Japan’s peace and security.
A. Cooperative Measures from Peacetime
In order to ensure the maintenance of Japan’s peace and security,  the
two governments will promote cooperation across a wide range of
areas, including through diplomatic efforts, to strengthen the deterrence
and capabilities of the Japan-U.S. Alliance.
The Self-Defense Forces and the United States Armed Forces
will enhance interoperability, readiness, and vigilance to prepare for
all possible situations. To these ends, the two governments will take
measures, including, but not limited to, the following:
1. Intelligence, Surveillance, and Reconnaissance
In order to identify at the earliest possible stage any indications
of threats to Japan’s peace and security and to ensure a decisive
advantage in intelligence gathering and analysis, the two
governments will share and protect information and intelligence,
while developing and maintaining common situational awareness.
This will include enhancing coordination and cooperation among
relevant agencies.
The Self-Defense Forces and the United States Armed Forces
will conduct intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance (ISR)
activities based on the capabilities and availability of their respective
assets. This will include conducting bilateral ISR activities in
a mutually supportive manner to ensure persistent coverage of
developments that could affect Japan’s peace and security.
2. Air and Missile Defense
The Self-Defense Forces and the United States Armed Forces will
maintain and strengthen deterrence and their defense postures
against ballistic missile launches and aerial incursions. The two
governments will cooperate to expand early warning capabilities,
interoperability, network coverage, and real-time information
exchange and to pursue the comprehensive improvement of
capabilities to respond to the threat of ballistic missiles. Moreover,
the two governments will continue to coordinate closely in
responding to provocative missile launches and other aerial
activities.
3. Maritime Security
The two governments will cooperate closely with each other on
measures to maintain maritime order based upon international law,
including freedom of navigation. The Self-Defense Forces and
the United States Armed Forces will cooperate, as appropriate, on


-----

various efforts such as maintaining and enhancing bilateral presence
in the maritime domain through ISR and training and exercises,
while further developing and enhancing shared maritime domain
awareness including by coordinating with relevant agencies, as
necessary.
4. Asset Protection
The Self-Defense Forces and the United States Armed Forces will
provide mutual protection of each other’s assets, as appropriate, if
engaged in activities that contribute to the defense of Japan in a
cooperative manner, including during training and exercises.
5. Training and Exercises
The Self-Defense Forces and the United States Armed Forces
will conduct effective bilateral and multilateral training and
exercises both inside and outside of Japan in order to strengthen
interoperability, sustainability, and readiness. Timely and realistic
training and exercises will enhance deterrence. To support these
activities, the two governments will cooperate to ensure that
training areas, facilities, and associated equipment are available,
accessible, and modern.
6. Logistic Support
Japan and the United States are primarily responsible for providing
logistic support for their respective forces in all phases. The SelfDefense Forces and the United States Armed Forces will provide
mutual logistic support where appropriate, including, but not
limited to, supply, maintenance, transportation, engineering, and
medical services, for such activities as set forth in the Agreement
between the Government of Japan and the Government of the
United States of America Concerning Reciprocal Provision of
Logistic Support, Supplies and Services between the Self-Defense
Forces of Japan and the Armed Forces of the United States of
America (the Acquisition and Cross-Servicing Agreement) and its
related arrangements.
7. Use of Facilities
In order to expand interoperability and improve flexibility and
resiliency of the Self-Defense Forces and the United States
Armed Forces, the two governments will enhance joint/shared
use and cooperate in ensuring the security of facilities and areas.
Recognizing the importance of being prepared for contingencies,
the two governments also will cooperate in conducting site surveys
on facilities including civilian airports and seaports, as appropriate.
B. Responses to Emerging Threats to Japan’s Peace and Security
The Alliance will respond to situations that will have an important
influence on Japan’s peace and security. Such situations cannot
be defined geographically. The measures described in this section
include those that may be taken, in accordance with the two countries’
respective laws and regulations, in circumstances that have not yet
amounted to such a situation. Early recognition and adaptable, resolute

**Reference 26 Joint Statement of the Security Consultative Committee**
**(2+2) (tentative translation)**

(April 19, 2019)
**Joint Statement of the Security Consultative Committee**
On April 19, 2019, the U.S.–Japan Security Consultative Committee
convened in Washington, DC, with the participation of Secretary of State
Pompeo, Acting Secretary of Defense Shanahan, Minister for Foreign Affairs
Kono, and Minister of Defense Iwaya. During the meeting, the Ministers
affirmed their strong commitment to realize a “free and open Indo-Pacific,”
a shared vision for a region in which all nations are sovereign, strong, and
prosperous. Decades after the U.S.-Japan Treaty of Mutual Cooperation and
Security was signed, the U.S.-Japan Alliance serves as the cornerstone of
peace, security, and prosperity in the Indo-Pacific region and remains ironclad amid an increasingly complex security environment. The Alliance will
continue to play an indispensable role in upholding a rules-based international
order and promoting the shared values of the American and Japanese people.
The Ministers welcomed the alignment of the strategic policy documents
of both countries, namely the United States’ National Security Strategy
and National Defense Strategy, and Japan’s National Defense Program
Guidelines. These strategies show that the U.S.-Japan security partnership
continues to adapt to be stronger, more advanced, and more effective,
consistent with the objectives of the bilateral 2015 Guidelines for U.S.-Japan
Defense Cooperation.
The Ministers acknowledged their shared concern that geopolitical
competition and coercive attempts to undermine international rules, norms,
and institutions present challenges to the Alliance and to the shared vision
of a free and open Indo-Pacific. The Ministers highlighted the need for an
increasingly networked structure of alliances and partnerships, anchored
by the U.S.-Japan Alliance, to counter these challenges. The Ministers also
expressed concern about rapidly evolving technological advancement in new
domains, including space, cyberspace, and the electromagnetic spectrum. The
Ministers highlighted the need to address these challenges jointly to ensure
the Alliance’s superiority in a contingency and to safeguard our institutions
and rules-based order during peacetime.
The Ministers affirmed that their two nations’ strong bilateral security
relationship continues to be the foundation of the U.S.-Japan Alliance. As
such, the Ministers decided that cooperation in cross- domain operations,
enhancing the Alliance’s capabilities, and increasing operational readiness
and cooperation should be core objectives to advance our defense relationship.
The United States welcomed Japan’s proactive steps to strengthen its
defensive capabilities, with the Ministers confirming that both nations need to
constantly re-evaluate their roles, missions, and capabilities.
Acknowledging the changing dynamics of warfare, the Ministers
highlighted the importance of developing capabilities and increasing
operational cooperation in both conventional and non- conventional domains.
The Ministers highlighted space, cyberspace, and the electromagnetic
spectrum as priority areas to better prepare the Alliance for cross-domain
operations.
On cyberspace issues, the Ministers recognized that malicious cyber
activity presents an increasing threat to the security and prosperity of both
the United States and Japan. To address this threat, the Ministers committed
to enhance cooperation on cyber issues, including deterrence and response
capabilities, but as a matter of priority, emphasized that each nation is
responsible for developing the relevant capabilities to protect their national
networks and critical infrastructure. The Ministers affirmed that international
law applies in cyberspace and that a cyber attack could, in certain


circumstances, constitute an armed attack for the purposes of Article V of the
U.S.-Japan Security Treaty. The Ministers also affirmed that a decision as to
when a cyber attack would constitute an armed attack under Article V would
be made on a case-by-case basis, and through close consultations between
Japan and the United States, as would be the case for any other threat.
The Ministers recognized the critical role that U.S. extended deterrence
plays in ensuring the security of Japan, as well as the peace and stability of
the Indo-Pacific region. The United States reiterated its commitment to the
defense of Japan through the full range of U.S. military capabilities, including
conventional and nuclear.
The Ministers reiterated the importance of the international community’s
ongoing commitment to achieving North Korea’s abandonment of all of its
weapons of mass destruction, ballistic missiles, and related programs and
facilities in a complete, verifiable, and irreversible manner in accordance with
relevant UN Security Council resolutions. The Ministers welcomed the United
States’ diplomatic efforts to achieve the final, fully verified denuclearization of
the Korean Peninsula, including through the U.S.-North Korea Summits. The
Ministers affirmed their commitment to lead international efforts in UNSCR
implementation, particularly in combatting illicit ship-to-ship transfers, and
the Ministers committed to strengthen and enhance cooperation with other
partner countries participating in UNSCR implementation. The Ministers also
recognized the successful efforts to bring back U.S. nationals held in North
Korea, and called upon North Korea to resolve the Japanese abductions issue
immediately.
The Ministers reaffirmed that U.S. force posture in the region would
remain robust and grounded in a clear-eyed assessment of threats, and they
determined to deepen consultation on ensuring deterrence and security in the
region. The Ministers also highlighted the importance of cooperation among
the United States, Japan, and the Republic of Korea, and committed to work
together to promote trilateral security cooperation and exercises.
The Ministers expressed serious concern about, and strong opposition to,
unilateral coercive attempts to alter the status quo in the East China Sea (ECS)
and South China Sea (SCS). The Ministers renewed their determination to
work together to safeguard the peace and stability of the ECS, and reconfirmed
that Article V of the U.S.-Japan Security Treaty applies to the Senkaku Islands
and that both nations oppose any unilateral action that seeks to undermine
Japan’s administration of these islands.
The Ministers renewed their commitment to work both together and
multilaterally to further support a free and open Indo-Pacific, including
through joint exercises and port calls with partners in the region, capacity
building in such areas as maritime domain awareness and law enforcement,
and promotion of sustainable economic development and connectivity
through quality infrastructure. The Ministers also recognized the crucial role
of the U.S.-Japan Security arrangements in facilitating the greater presence of
U.S. forces in the region.
To enable the United States to continue to maintain forward deployed
forces in Japan, the Ministers reaffirmed the two Governments’ commitment
to steadily implement the realignment of U.S. forces. The Ministers also
welcomed the significant progress on the Futenma Replacement Facility
(FRF) and reconfirmed that the plan to construct the FRF at the Camp
Schwab-Henokosaki area and adjacent waters is the only solution that
avoids the continued use of Marine Corps Air Station (MCAS) Futenma. The
Ministers underscored their strong determination to achieve its completion as
soon as possible.
In recognition of the depth and breadth of the U.S.-Japan Alliance, the
Ministers agreed to release a fact sheet detailing additional areas of bilateral
cooperation.

**Reference 30   The SACO Final Report (tentative translation)**
(December 2, 1996)
The Special Action Committee on Okinawa (SACO) was established in
November 1995 by the Governments of Japan and the United States. The
two Governments launched the SACO process to reduce the burden on the
people of Okinawa and thereby strengthen the Japan–U.S. alliance.
The mandate and guidelines for the SACO process were set forth by
the Governments of Japan and the United States at the outset of the
joint endeavor. Both sides decided that the SACO would develop
recommendations for the Security Consultative Committee (SCC) on ways
to realign, consolidate and reduce U.S. facilities and areas, and adjust
operational procedures of U.S. forces in Okinawa consistent with their
respective obligations under the Treaty of Mutual Cooperation and Security
and other related agreements. The work of the SACO was scheduled to
conclude after one year.
The SCC which was held on April 15, 1996, approved the SACO Interim
Report which included several significant initiatives, and instructed the
SACO to complete and recommend plans with concrete implementation
schedules by November 1996.
The SACO, together with the Joint Committee, has conducted a series of
intensive and detailed discussions and developed concrete plans and
measures to implement the recommendations set forth in the Interim Report.
Today, at the SCC, Minister Ikeda, Minister Kyuma, Secretary Perry and
Ambassador Mondale approved this SACO Final Report. The plans and
measures included in this Final Report, when implemented, will reduce the
impact of the activities of U.S. forces on communities in Okinawa. At the
same time, these measures will fully maintain the capabilities and readiness
of U.S. forces in Japan while addressing security and force protection
requirements. Approximately 21 percent of the total acreage of the U.S.
facilities and areas in Okinawa excluding joint use facilities and areas
(approx. 5,002ha/12,361 acres) will be returned.
Upon approving the Final Report, the members of the SCC welcomed the
successful conclusion of the yearlong SACO process and underscored their
strong resolve to continue joint efforts to ensure steady and prompt
implementation of the plans and measures of the SACO Final Report. With
this understanding, the SCC designated the Joint Committee as the primary
forum for bilateral coordination in the implementation phase, where specific
conditions for the completion of each item will be addressed. Coordination
with local communities will take place as necessary.
The SCC also reaffirmed the commitment of the two governments to
make every endeavor to deal with various issues related to the presence and
status of U.S. forces, and to enhance mutual understanding between U.S.
forces and local Japanese communities. In this respect, the SCC agreed that
efforts to these ends should continue, primarily through coordination at the
Joint Committee.
The members of the SCC agreed that the SCC itself and the Security SubCommittee (SSC) would monitor such coordination at the Joint Committee
described above and provide guidance as appropriate. The SCC also
instructed the SSC to seriously address the Okinawa-related issues as one of
the most important subjects and regularly report back to the SCC on this
subject.
In accordance with the April 1996 Japan–U.S. Joint Declaration on
Security, the SCC emphasized the importance of close consultation on the
international situation, defense policies and military postures, bilateral
policy coordination and efforts towards a more peaceful and stable security
environment in the Asia-Pacific region. The SCC instructed the SSC to
pursue these goals and to address the Okinawa related issues at the same
time.

payment will be accomplished as rapidly as possible.

-  A new system will be introduced by the end of March 1998, by which
Japanese authorities will make available to claimants no interest loans,
as appropriate, in advance of the final adjudication of claims by U.S.
authorities.

-  In the past there have been only a very few cases where payment by the
U.S. Government did not satisfy the full amount awarded by a final
court judgment. Should such a case occur in the future, the Government
of Japan will endeavor to make payment to the claimant, as appropriate,
in order to address the difference in amount.
— Quarantine procedures
Implement the updated agreement on quarantine procedures announced
by the Joint Committee on December 2, 1996.
— Removal of unexploded ordnance in Camp Hansen

**The SACO Final Report on Futenma Air Station**
**(an integral part of the SACO Final Report) (tentative translation)**
(Tokyo, Japan, December 2, 1996)
1. Introduction
a. At the Security Consultative Committee (SCC) held on December 2,
1996, Minister Ikeda, Minister Kyuma, Secretary Perry, and
Ambassador Mondale reaffirmed their commitment to the Special
Action Committee on Okinawa (SACO) Interim Report of April 15,
1996 and the Status Report of September 19, 1996. Based on the
SACO Interim Report, both Governments have been working to
determine a suitable option for the return of Futenma Air Station and
the relocation of its assets to other facilities and areas in Okinawa,
while maintaining the airfield’s critical military functions and
capabilities. The Status Report called for the Special Working Group
on Futenma to examine three specific alternatives: 1) incorporate the
heliport into Kadena Air Base; 2) construct a heliport at Camp
Schwab; and 3) develop and construct a sea-based facility (SBF).
b. On December 2, 1996, the SCC approved the SACO recommendation
to pursue the SBF option. Compared to the other two options, the SBF
is judged to be the best option in terms of enhanced safety and quality
of life for the Okinawan people while maintaining operational
capabilities of U.S. forces. In addition, the SBF can function as a fixed
facility during its use as a military base and can also be removed when
no longer necessary.
c. The SCC will establish a bilateral U.S.–Japan working group under
the supervision of the Security Sub-Committee (SSC) entitled the
Futenma Implementation Group (FIG), to be supported by a team of
technical experts. The FIG, working with the Joint Committee, will
develop a plan for implementation no later than December 1997. Upon
SCC approval of this plan, the FIG, working with the Joint Committee,
will oversee design, construction, testing, and transfer of assets.
Throughout this process, the FIG will periodically report to the SSC
on the status of its work.
2. Decisions of the SCC
a. Pursue construction of an SBF to absorb most of the helicopter
operational functions of Futenma Air Station. This facility will be
approximately 1,500 meters long, and will support the majority of
Futenma Air Station’s flying operations, including an Instrument
Flight Rules (IFR)—capable runway (approximately 1,300 meters
long), direct air operations support, and indirect support infrastructure
such as headquarters, maintenance, logistics, quality-of-life functions,
and base operating support. The SBF will be designed to support
basing of helicopter assets, and will also be able to support short-field
aircraft operations.


b. Transfer 12 KC-130 aircraft to Iwakuni Air Base. Construct facilities
at this base to ensure that associated infrastructure is available to
support these aircraft and their missions.
c. Develop additional facilities at Kadena Air Base to support aircraft,
maintenance, and logistics operations which are currently available at
Futenma Air Station but are not relocated to the SBF or Iwakuni Air
Base.
d. Study the emergency and contingency use of alternate facilities, which
may be needed in the event of a crisis. This is necessary because the
transfer of functions from Futenma Air Station to the SBF will reduce
operational flexibility currently available.
e. Return Futenma Air Station within the next five to seven years, after
adequate replacement facilities are completed and operational.
3. Guiding Principles
a. Futenma Air Station’s critical military functions and capabilities will
be maintained and will continue to operate at current readiness levels
throughout the transfer of personnel and equipment and the relocation
of facilities.
b. To the greatest extent possible, Futenma Air Station’s operations and
activities will be transferred to the SBF. Operational capabilities and
contingency planning flexibility which cannot be supported by the
shorter runway of the SBF (such as strategic airlift, logistics,
emergency alternate divert, and contingency throughput) must be fully
supported elsewhere. Those facilities unable to be located on the SBF,
due to operational cost, or quality-of-life considerations, will be
located on existing U.S. facilities and areas.
c. The SBF will be located off the east coast of the main island of
Okinawa, and is expected to be connected to land by a pier or
causeway. Selection of the location will take into account operational
requirements, airspace and sea-lane deconfliction, fishing access,
environmental compatibility, economic effects, noise abatement,
survivability, security, and convenient, acceptable personnel access to
other U.S. military facilities and housing.
d. The design of the SBF will incorporate adequate measures to ensure
platform, aircraft, equipment, and personnel survivability against
severe weather and ocean conditions; corrosion control treatment and
prevention for the SBF and all equipment located on the SBF; safety;
and platform security. Support will include reliable and secure fuel
supply, electrical power, fresh water, and other utilities and
consumables. Additionally, the facility will be fully self-supporting for
short-period contingency/emergency operations.
e. The Government of Japan will provide the SBF and other relocation
facilities for the use of U.S. forces, in accordance with the U.S.–Japan
Treaty of Mutual Cooperation and Security and the Status of Forces
Agreement. The two Governments will further consider all aspects of
life-cycle costs as part of the design/acquisition decision.
f. The Government of Japan will continue to keep the people of Okinawa
informed of the progress of this plan, including concept, location, and
schedules of implementation.
4. Possible Sea-Based Facility Construction Methods
Studies have been conducted by a “Technical Support Group” comprised
of Government engineers under the guidance of a “Technical Advisory
Group” comprised of university professors and other experts outside the
Government. These studies suggested that all three construction methods
mentioned below are technically feasible.
a. Pile Supported Pier Type (using floating modules)—supported by a
number of steel columns fixed to the sea bed.
b. Pontoon Type—platform consisting of steel pontoon type units,
installed in a calm sea protected by a breakwater.
c. Semi-Submersible Type—platform at a wave free height, supported by
buoyancy of the lower structure submerged under the sea.
5. The Next Steps
a. The FIG will recommend a candidate SBF area to the SCC as soon as
possible and formulate a detailed implementation plan no later than
December 1997. This plan will include completion of the following
items: concept development and definitions of operational
requirements, technology performance specifications and construction
method, site survey, environmental analysis, and final concept and site
selection.
b. The FIG will establish phases and schedules to achieve operational
capabilities at each location, including facility design, construction,
installation of required components, validation tests and suitability
demonstrations, and transfer of operations to the new facility.
c. The FIG will conduct periodic reviews and make decisions at
significant milestones concerning SBF program feasibility.

**Reference 35   Outline of the Act on Special Measures on Smooth Implementation of the Realignment of United States Forces in Japan**

1. Purpose


It is critically important to realize the realignment of the United States Forces in Japan (USFJ), in order to contribute to the maintenance of peace and
security in Japan and to mitigate the impact of defense facilities on surrounding residents by all of Japan. In this light, the purpose of this Act is to
contribute to the smooth implementation of USFJ realignment by taking the following special measures, etc.


2. Special Measures, etc.

(1) Realignment grants for municipalities incurring greater impacts


 In connection with the realignment of USFJ, the national government designates defense facilities for which it is deemed that consideration must be paid to
their increasing impacts on the stability of the lives of the residents in the surrounding areas. Realignment grants are awarded to municipalities in the area
of such defense facilities, in order to cover the expenses of the projects that contribute to making the residents’ lives more convenient and to developing
industries, if the grants are considered necessary to help carry out the USFJ realignment smoothly and infallibly.

 The national government takes into consideration the extent that the stability of the lives of the residents is impacted, and awards the realignment grants

based on both the progress of the measures for achieving realignment and the length of time that has passed since the measures were first implemented.

(2) Public project special provisions for areas incurring particularly large impacts


 Designate areas that include municipalities incurring particularly large impacts as Special Area for Development concerning Realignment, and promote the

development of these areas by establishing special provisions for cost sharing by local governments when developing roads, ports, and other infrastructure.

 Set up at the MOD the Council for Local Development concerning Realignment of U.S. Forces in Japan and Related SDF Forces comprised of relevant

ministers, and at the Council’s meetings discuss matters such as the designation of the Special Area for Development concerning Realignment and the
establishment of the development plan for the area (Development Plan for Special Area for Development concerning Realignment).

(3) Measures for USFJ local employees


 Implement skills education and training that contribute to the continuous employment of USFJ local employees.


3. Expiration of the Law

This Act expires on March 31, 2027; provided, however, that the realignment grants will be awarded until March 31, 2032 at the latest based on
the situation of the realignment.


Notes: 1. At the time of its enactment this Act was set to expire on March 31, 2017. However, the term of validity has been extended by 10 years to March 31, 2027 pursuantto
the law for the partial revision of this Act which entered into force on March 31, 2017.
2. At the time of its enactment, this Act provided for the special measures, etc. under this Act in 2. (1) to (3) above, as well as for special provisions for the operations of
the Japan Bank for International Cooperation for the implementation of investments and loans for family housing and infrastructure development related to USFJ
relocation to the United States of America (Guam) for the promotion of said relocation.
However, the said provision was abolished pursuant to the law for the partial revision of this Act which entered into force on March 31, 2017, after the 2+2 Joint
Statement of April 2012 limited Japan’ s financial commitment for the relocation of the U.S. Marine Corps in Okinawa to Guam to direct cash contribution and it was
confirmed that other forms of financial assistance (investments and loans) would not be utilized.

and the Cabinet on April 1, 2014)

TThe Government has made it its basic policy to deal with overseas

transfer of defense equipment and technology in a careful manner in

accordance with Prime Minster Eisaku Sato’s remarks at the Diet in 1967

(hereinafter referred to as “the Three Principles on Arms Exports”) and the

collateral policy guideline by the Miki administration in 1976. These policy

guidelines have played a certain role as Japan has been following the path of

a peace-loving nation. On the other hand, these policy guidelines including

the non-permission of arms exports to communist bloc countries have

increasingly proved unsuitable for the current situation. Also, the

Government has repeatedly taken exemption measures depending on the

individual necessity of each case since arms exports to substantially all areas

were not permitted, as a result of not promoting arms exports regardless of

the destinations.

Japan has consistently followed the path of a peace-loving nation since

the end of World War II. Japan has adhered to a basic policy of maintaining

an exclusively national defense-oriented policy, not becoming a military

power that poses a threat to other countries, and observing the Three Non
Nuclear Principles. At the same time, surrounded by an increasingly severe

security environment and confronted by complex and grave national security

challenges, it has become essential for Japan to make more proactive efforts

in line with the principle of international cooperation. Japan cannot secure

its own peace and security by itself, and the international community expects

Japan to play a more proactive role for peace and stability in the world

commensurate with its national capabilities. Against this backdrop, under the

evolving security environment, Japan will continue to adhere to the course

that it has taken to date as a peace-loving nation, and as a major player in

world politics and the world economy, contribute even more proactively in

securing peace, stability and prosperity of the international community,

while achieving its own security as well as peace and stability in the Asia
Pacific region, as a “Proactive Contributor to Peace” based on the principle

of international cooperation.

From the view point of achieving the fundamental principle of national

security by implementing concrete policies, the Government, in accordance

with the National Security Strategy adopted on December 17, 2013, decided

to review the Government’s existing policy guidelines on overseas transfer

of defense equipment and technology, and set out clear principles which fit

the new security environment while giving due consideration to the roles

that the existing policy guidelines have played so far and by consolidating

the policy guidelines comprehensively with consideration on the past

exemption measures.

An appropriate overseas transfer of defense equipment and technology

contributes to further active promotion of the maintenance of international

peace and security through timely and effective implementation of

contribution to peace and international cooperation such as international

peace cooperation, international disaster relief, humanitarian assistance,

responses to international terrorism and piracy, and capacity building of

developing countries (hereinafter referred to as “peace contribution and

international cooperation”). Such transfer also contributes to strengthening

security and defense cooperation with Japan’s ally, the United States as well

as other countries. Furthermore, it contributes to maintaining and enhancing

Japan’s defense production and technological bases, thereby contributing to

Japan’s enhancement of defense capability, given that international joint

development and production projects have become the international

mainstream in order to improve the performance of defense equipment and

to deal with their rising costs.

On the other hand, since the distribution of defense equipment and

technology has significant security, social, economic and humanitarian


impact on the international community, the need for each government to

control the transfer of defense equipment and technology in a responsible

manner while taking various factors into account is recognized.

In light of the above, while maintaining its basic philosophy as a peace
loving nation that conforms to the Charter of the United Nations and the

course it has taken as a peace-loving nation, Japan will control the overseas

transfer of defense equipment and technology based on the following three

principles. The overseas transfer of facilities related to arms production will

continue to be treated in the same manner as defense equipment and

technology.

**1. Clarification of cases where transfers are prohibited**

Overseas transfer of defense equipment and technology will not be

permitted when:

1) the transfer violates obligations under treaties and other international

agreements that Japan has concluded,

2) the transfer violates obligations under United Nations Security Council

resolutions, or

3) the defense equipment and technology is destined for a country party to

a conflict (a country against which the United Nations Security Council

is taking measures to maintain or restore international peace and

security in the event of an armed attack).

**2. Limitation to cases where transfers may be permitted as well as strict**

**examination and information disclosure**

In cases not within 1. above, cases where transfers may be permitted will

be limited to the following cases. Those cases will be examined strictly

while ensuring transparency. More specifically, overseas transfer of

defense equipment and technology may be permitted in such cases as the

transfer contributes to active promotion of peace contribution and

international cooperation, or to Japan’s security from the viewpoint of—

implementing international joint development and production projects

with countries cooperating with Japan in security area including its ally,

the U.S. (hereinafter referred to as “the ally and partners”), —enhancing

security and defense cooperation with the ally and partners, as well as—

supporting the activities of the Self-Defense Forces including the

maintenance of its equipment and ensuring the safety of Japanese

nationals. The Government will conduct strict examination on the

appropriateness of the destination and end user, and the extent the

overseas transfer of such equipment and technology will raise concern for

Japan’s security. Then the Government will make a comprehensive

judgment in light of the existing guidelines of the international export

control regime and based on the information available at the time of

export examinations.

Significant cases that require especially careful consideration from the

viewpoint of Japan’s security will be examined at the National Security

Council (NSC). As for the cases that were deliberated at the NSC, the

Government will disclose their information in accordance with the Act on

Access to Information Held by Administrative Organs (Law No. 42 of

1999).

**3. Ensuring appropriate control regarding extra-purpose use or transfer to**

**third parties**

In cases satisfying 2. above, overseas transfer of defense equipment and

technology will be permitted only in cases where appropriate control is

ensured. More concretely, the Government will in principle oblige the

Government of the recipient country to gain its prior consent regarding

extra-purpose use and transfer to third parties. However, appropriate

control may be ensured with the confirmation of control system at the

destination in such cases as those where the transfer is judged to be

appropriate for active promotion of peace contribution and international

cooperation, when the transfer involves participation in an international

system for sharing parts etc., and when the transfer involves delivery of

parts etc. to a licenser.


-----

Implementation guidelines for the policy described above will be

decided by the NSC. The Minister of Economy, Trade and Industry will

implement the Foreign Exchange and Foreign Trade Act (Law No.228 of

1949) appropriately in accordance with the decision.

For the purpose of this policy, “defense equipment and technology”

refers to “arms and military technologies”; “arms” refers to items listed in

Section 1, Annexed List 1 of the Export Trade Control Order (Cabinet

Order No. 378 of 1949), and are to be used by military forces and directly

employed in combat; and “military technologies” refers to technologies

for the design, production or use of arms.


The Government will contribute actively to the peace and stability of

the international community as a “Proactive Contributor to Peace” based

on the principle of international cooperation. Under such policy, it will

play a proactive role in the area of controlling defense equipment and

technology as well as sensitive dual-use goods and technologies to

achieve the early entry into force of the Arms Trade Treaty and further

strengthen the international export control regimes.
