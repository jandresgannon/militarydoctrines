FOREWORD BY THE PRESIDENT
OF THE REPUBLIC OF POLAND
BRONISŁAW KOMOROWSKI

_Th e past two decades brought about numerous dynamic changes in Poland’s security_
_strategic environment. Globalization and information revolution have contributed to the_
_world’s becoming more interconnected through increasingly tighter networks of interdepen-_
_dence. Along with the opportunities, new challenges, risks and threats to security have ap-_
_peared. Uncertainties have grown, while the level of trust has gone down. Although the threat_
_of mass-scale armed confl icts among states has become less imminent and the number of_
_internal confl icts (aft er the initial increase in the 1990s) has dwindled, equally dangerous_
_transnational and asymmetric threats have occured as well as new challenges have emerged,_
_particularly for the societal and economic (fi nancial, energy) security sectors. In addition,_
_we are facing an eruption of threats in cyberspace. All this will require a new approach to_
_national security._

_Poland has grasped the opportunity provided by the peace dividend of the past twenty_
_years. Th e Polish national security potential has grown, we have become a part of NATO_
_and the European Union, and we develop strategic cooperation with the United States. Th is_

_allows us to get engaged in stabilization operations in the world – we no longer “consume”_
_security; now we also “produce” it. It does not mean, however, that we can rest on our laurels._
_We must continuously bear in mind the security of our country; we must constantly strive_
_for it._

_Today, at the onset of the second decade of the 21[st] century, we need to view national_
_security in a comprehensive perspective. We must defi ne our interests and strategic objec-_
_tives as well as the manner of achieving them pursuant to the new circumstances. Simulta-_
_neously, we need to transform the entire system of national security, striving especially for_
_its integration. Th ese issues were the subject of analyses carried out by the National Security_
_Strategic Review Commission which I called into being in November 2010. Th e Commission_
_approached the issues of security in a complex manner, focusing not only on defence, which_
_to me as the Supreme Commander of the Armed Forces of the Republic of Poland is of par-_
_ticular importance, but also on the protective, societal and economic aspects._

_Th e review constituted an innovative, analytical and organizational project. Many of_
_the issues have never been covered so extensively before. Th is concerned the multi-faceted_
_approach to security issues, specifi cation of national interests and strategic objectives, prepa-_
_ration of alternative scenarios of the development of the security environment as well as of_
_corresponding concepts of strategic activities in the fi eld of security and options regarding the_
_preparation of the national security system for the implementation of these activities._

_Th e key conclusions from the Review were set forth in a classifi ed Report, which served_
_as the basis for the present White Book on National Security. Th is Book is addressed to all_
_fellow citizens, since the issues of national security are and should be important to us all._
_I also regard the publication of this Book as the fulfi lment of my obligation to provide relia-_
_ble information on issues relating to security._

_I am deeply convinced that this Book will contribute to a widespread public debate_
_about Poland’s security._

_I invite everyone to read it._

SYNTHESIS

Th e purpose of the present White Book on National Security of the Republic of Poland, which is
addressed to all state structures, public and non-public organizations and citizens, is to help deepen the
knowledge and public awareness of the security of Poland and Polish citizens.

Th e Book has been elaborated on the basis of the National Security Strategic Review (NSSR),
including, in particular, the Report of the NSSR Commission, containing key conclusions and recommendations concerning Poland’s security policy, including the streamlining of the national security system.

Diagnosis of the state of national security

Th e basis for strategic planning in the area of security is to determine the national interests
and resulting strategic objectives. Th e starting point for defi ning these objectives and interests was the
diagnosis of Poland as a strategic security entity, made in the context of both the historical formation
of Polish national identity and statehood, the present constitutional and political conditions, and the
current defence, protection, societal and economic potential.

**Historical experience proves that the geopolitical location of Poland between the West and the**
East was the most critical strategic factor which infl uenced the formation of Polish national identity
and statehood as well as determined the fundamental nature and character of national interests and
strategic objectives in the fi eld of security. Due to numerous confl icts (external wars and internal crises),
the security issues were in the centre of attention of the authorities and the people for a long time in
Polish history. Ignoring these issues led either to the state’s marginalization on the international scene
(the period of division into several duchies) or a total collapse of the state (the partition period). Th e
history also shows the importance of harmony (the right proportions) between particular interests (of
an individual) and collective interests (of the state) as well as between material and intangible (spiritual)
interests. Th e prevalence of individual or particular interests (dynastic interests, the gentry’s “golden
freedom”, etc.) over the national ones and ignoring the constant need for the material development of
the state have resulted in two major collapses of the Polish state. On the other hand, the cultivation of
intangible values, culture and national identity during the partition period allowed the Polish nation to
survive 123 years of enslavement.

In modern states, the individual liberty to interpret and implement national interests is limited
primarily by the system founding rules for functioning of states, which are codifi ed in constitutions.
Such rules were also set forth in the Constitution of the Republic of Poland. Th e national interests
formulated within such frameworks may be of various scale and strength; they may be more or less ambitious. Th is depends on the strategic potential of the state, which determines (i.e. limits or strengthens)
these ambitions.

Poland’s national interests and strategic objectives in the fi eld of security are largely infl uenced
by the state of the national security system. At present, the system is a sum of separate, variously interrelated operational and support subsystems and of a weakly coherent subsystem of national security
control. Th is hampers the synergy eff ect. Responsibilities of specifi c entities are dispersed or duplicated;
there are too many planning authorities, and coordination is limited. Consistent laws are lacking, especially with regard to the subsystem of national security control. On the one hand, such situation causes
the risk of gaps in responsibilities; on the other hand, it leads to unnecessary duplication of eff orts,
therefore certain powers and resources are wasted and the system is uneconomical and ineff ective.


-----

### WHITE BOOKTON NATIONAL SECURITY OF THE REPUBLIC OF POLAND

National interests and strategic objectives are reinforced by international relations in the fi eld
of security. Poland is a credible member of NATO, the strongest defence alliance in the world, and an
important and active member of the European Union. Moreover, Poland develops strategic relations
with the United States and is actively involved in regional cooperation, including with its neighbours.
Th is enables defi ning more ambitious national interests and strategic objectives.

Another factor having substantial infl uence on national interests and strategic objectives in the
fi eld of security is the defence potential. Th e foreign service (diplomacy), whose activities are focused
on security, and the Polish defence industry both play an important role in this context. Its main element,
however, is the Armed Forces of the Republic of Poland that maintain readiness to perform their three
main missions: guaranteeing defence of the state and counteracting aggression in accordance with allied
commitments; participating in the process of stabilization of the international situation and in crisis response and humanitarian operations; and supporting the internal security and assisting the population.
Th e strategic potential of the Polish Armed Forces, including their combat capabilities, is systematically
improved. Th e professionalization and transformation of the Armed Forces are oriented towards increasing
their defence operational capabilities, which also provide an opportunity to participate in allied operations
outside the territory of the country. Th e improvement of operational capabilities of the Polish Armed
Forces in recent years has had a positive impact on the level of Polish strategic ambitions and at the same
time on the scale and nature of national interests and strategic objectives in the fi eld of security.

Th e protection potential (services and guards) plays a major role in defi ning interests and strategic objectives. It faces now a number of challenges resulting, inter alia, from the escalation of the broadly
understood organized crime, the threat of terrorism (including cyber-terrorism), and an increase in illegal
migration. It is also important to note the signifi cant defi ciencies, e.g. in the rescue system and, in particular,
insuffi cient coordination of activities performed by the central and self-government administration, the
lack of resources for preventive activities, and weaknesses of the warning system. Excessive number of
services and dispersed supervision complicate coordination and weaken the eff ectiveness of the protection
potential. Consequently, the possible level of ambitions in defi ning national interests and strategic objectives in the fi eld of security is limited.

Analysis of Poland’s **societal and economic potential reveals its diverse impact on the**
defi nition of national interests and strategic objectives in the fi eld of security. Th e strategic potential
as well as the scale and nature of the state’s national interests and strategic objectives are adversely
infl uenced by diffi culties in such areas as demography, science, and technology. Other signifi cant
challenges include: the high unemployment rate which has a direct impact on the state of economy,
barriers to entrepreneurship, and diffi culties in creating appropriate conditions for the development
of the societal potential.

Th e development of economy is a favourable factor. Despite the current crisis, Poland has managed to maintain the growth of its gross domestic product (GDP). Moderation in defi ning interests,
however, is imposed by the state of public fi nances, which is a consequence of general imbalance in the
fi nancial sector. Th e state of infrastructure in terms of security is also unsatisfactory.

Ensuring the energy security is another challenge for Poland. Th e expected shale gas resources
off er an opportunity in this regard. Maintaining the necessary level of food self-suffi ciency of the
country, bio-safety of food products as well as drinking and industrial water resources – pose other
challenges which must be considered when defi ning national interests and strategic objectives in the
fi eld of security.


-----

SYNTHESIS

Th e diagnosis of Poland’s societal and economic potential shows that national interests and
strategic objectives in the fi eld of security should include the following: introducing an eff ective
pro-family policy; formulating a comprehensive migration policy; improving the innovativeness
(eff ectiveness, competitiveness) of economy; ensuring the fi nancial stability of the state; and improving
the energy security as well as ensuring the protection of the environment.

Th e historical experience which has determined the Polish strategic culture, the diagnoses of
the state’s strategic potential, and the provisions of the Constitution of the Republic of Poland may all
serve as a basis for the formulation of a catalogue of national interests and strategic objectives in the
**fi eld of security.**

Th e starting point is the set of so-called constitutional interests listed in Article 5 of the Constitution of the Republic of Poland, namely: the existence of the independent Polish state within its inviolable borders (state); freedom and security of citizens (citizens and society); sustainable development
of the societal (nation’s intangible assets) and economic (nation’s material assets) potential with the
constitutional emphasis on the national heritage and the protection of the environment.

Th e constitutional interests defi ned in this way provide the basis for identifying the following
national interests in the fi eld of security: development of the eff ective national security potential
(readiness and capability to deter, defend and protect); membership in credible international security
systems; freedom of citizens to exercise human rights and liberties without detriment to the security
of other persons and the security of the state; individual protection of citizens and collective protection
of population against accidental and intentional threats to their life and health as well as against any
violation, loss or degradation of the (material and spiritual) assets at their disposal; safe conditions for
developing the societal and economic potential; adequate societal and economic support for security,
corresponding to needs and capabilities.

Th e above interests, in turn, serve as the basis for deriving the corresponding sets of strategic
objectives of both an operational and preparatory nature.

Outlook for the security environment

One of the key factors shaping the security environment is the globalization and information
revolution, which generally help raise the level of prosperity as well as foster the spreading of modern
technologies and the improvement of methods of management and manners of fi nancing the economic development. Th ey create, therefore, a major opportunity for democratization as well as enable
economic and societal progress in the world, including also in its poorer regions.

Along with positive eff ects, the processes of globalization and information revolution bring
about new challenges and threats to worldwide security, both in the military and non-military aspects.
Th e severity and pace of new divisions in the world accompanying the globalization processes are
increasing. Th e development of technology and the expansion of the world market, in turn, led to the
rapidly growing demand for fuels, food and water. Th ese issues are important for worldwide policy,
economy, and societal processes.

Global and regional security is also infl uenced by instability in individual regions of the world.
At present, there are a number of hot spots (especially in the Middle East) which can become a source
of confl icts on a larger scale. Th is situation is accompanied by a dangerous phenomenon of prolifera

tion of weapons of mass destruction and means of their delivery. It causes the erosion of disarmament
regimes and, as a consequence, may lead to their breakdown.

At the global level, the most important challenge is posed by a group of failed and failing states
whose internal structural weakness, lack of an eff ective control over their territories or even internal
breakdowns have a negative impact on the situation in their vicinity.

It is predicted that in the coming decades the scale of transnational and asymmetric threats and
challenges will increase. Terrorism will constitute a threat to counteract which the countries will need
to prepare themselves not less than to the threat of war. Terrorist activity also spreads to cyberspace,
which becomes the area of rivalry and confrontation, including among states.

Th e faltering role of international organizations presents a serious challenge, which is refl ected
in their poor ability to launch eff ective, common mechanisms of security cooperation. It concerns,
in particular, the United Nations and, regionally (in Europe), the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe.

Th e process of relative decline of the nearly hegemonic, until recently, power of the United
States can be observed. It does not change the fact, however, that during the next two decades the USA
will continue to be the most powerful country in the world, both in terms of military potential and the
level of domestic product, and from the point of view of their share in global turnover capital and commodity markets. Projections which assume radical and increasingly faster development of the so-called emerging powers (frequently referred to also as BRIC countries: Brazil, Russia, India, and China)
as well as the leading position of China take into account the amount of GDP only. Th e United States,
however, is and will remain the issuer of the currency in which the vast majority of global fi nancial reserves have been accumulated as well as the world leader in the development of modern technologies.

Th e security of Europe is basically determined by the following four factors: NATO, the Euro**pean Union, the strategic presence of the USA, and relations with Russia.**

NATO is and most probably will remain the most powerful and eff ective political and military
alliance on the globe. Th e organization redefi ned its tasks in the context of the new international situation aft er the end of the cold war by adding two other tasks to the core mission of collective defence:
crisis management (in Polish terminology also referred to as crisis response) and ensuring security by
cooperation (cooperative security). Th e major challenge facing NATO is to defi ne its role in the “post-Afghan” period. Key in this context will be the answer to the following question: should the alliance
aft er the two decades of post-Cold-War enlargement move onto a new stage of consolidation around
its core function of ensuring direct security to its members, or should it continue the operational and
institutional development of its global role? It appears necessary above all to consolidate around the
defence function, thereby contributing to the strengthening of the sense of security of all member
countries of the Alliance and, consequently, increasing their willingness and readiness to engage in
_out-of-area operations which will be also necessary in the future._

Starting from the late 2008, the European Union has been facing a crisis and declining dynamics of the common economy. Despite this fact, it tries to adjust itself structurally to the new challenges, from among which the most demanding ones are the crisis of the euro area and diffi culties in
the development of the Common Security and Defence Policy (CSDP). Another serious challenge for
Europe is its low self-suffi ciency in terms of raw materials, which is compensated only partially by the
production of energy from alternative sources.


-----

SYNTHESIS

Th e most important challenge for economic security of the European Union pertains to fi nance. If
the EU member states are willing and ready to withstand the rigours of repair and the macroeconomic
policy in the euro area is reformed (above all, in order to extend the scope of community fi scal policy),
the crisis should be overcome.

A particularly serious challenge facing the EU is an update of the European Security Strategy
of 2003.

Th e strategic (political, military and economic) presence of the USA in Europe remains the
foundation of European security. Th ere is a number of unknowns connected with the more and more
visible strategic reorientation of the USA towards Asia and the Pacifi c.

An important external factor infl uencing the state of Poland’s security is **relations between**
**Russia and the West. Today, it is diffi cult to defi ne its clear perspective. Will Russia stick to its course**
towards restoration of its power status, ignoring interests of the others, especially its neighbours? Or
will it steer a course towards cooperation in building common security? Today, more likely seems the
continuation scenario, which is unfavourable to Poland.

Despite the crisis in the euro area and the economic stagnation, discrepancies in living standards, income, and access to goods and services, the escalating demographic crisis, as well as the
existence of peripheral hot spots which, in an unfavourable situation, can evolve into confl icts, Europe
is still widely perceived as a continent of prosperity and peace. Its centre (the European Union) holds
a powerful attraction for other countries.

**Challenges for and threats to Poland which arise from the analysis of its external security envi-**
ronment, are mainly of a non-military nature. Th e most serious non-military security challenges that Poland will have to meet are associated with ensuring the undisturbed economic development of the state,
a stable fi nancial situation, and consistent, far-reaching social policies, taking into account the containing
of the coming demographic decline. Signifi cant strategic dilemmas facing Poland during the next twenty
years also concern the need to ensure security in cyberspace as well as stave off the decapitalization of the
industrial and transport infrastructure. Th e decapitalization and, quite frequently, the devastation of the
infrastructure mean that the risk of technical and industrial disasters increases every year.

Military threats still remain signifi cant. Th ey may primarily have the nature of political and military crises provoked to exert a strategic pressure in the current politics, without crossing the brink of war.
Such activities might take the form of rapid development of military potential near the Polish borders,
practical demonstration of strength or military blackmail. Direct armed threats, however, cannot be excluded. Two kinds of such threats should be identifi ed: fi rst of all – threats which can be most generally
referred to as non-territorial (where an opponent does not intend to take control over the attacked territory), i.e. selective, pinpoint strikes, deliberately limited in scale and reach (oft en hidden, only implicit
in the authorship), the aim of which is to blackmail a given state or force it to take specifi c political steps
in isolation from the wider international security system (e.g. without NATO intervention, as a result
of creating situations which may be termed “consensus-challenging”, in which it would be diffi cult to
reach agreement among member countries on the manner and scope of response); secondly – threats
associated with a situation which today seems much less likely but at the same time would be the most
dangerous, such as war on a large scale. Such war could take place in an event of a radical change in the
current course of international policy, so it would need to be preceded by a rather long-lasting change in
the political and strategic situation in the world. As a result, there would be time to prepare a response,
including a collective response of the entire Alliance to which Poland belongs.

### WHITE BOOKTON NATIONAL SECURITY OF THE REPUBLIC OF POLAND

**Poland, as a member state of NATO and the EU, is a benefi ciary of positive political and econo-**
mic transformations in Europe. Th e predictions concerning internal security conditions should defi nitely exclude internal military threats (rebellion, coup). Th ere is a risk, however, of the spread of armed
organized crime, especially of the transnational character (with the large-scale use of weapons, e.g. in
criminal groups’ warfare). Tasks of the Armed Forces of the Republic of Poland will probably include,
_inter alia, the provision of traditional support for the other state structures in liquidating the eff ects of_
natural disasters and technical accidents or helping the state services to prevent uncontrollable mass
migrations of population within the territory of Poland.

Th e assessment of the security environment and directions of its development at global, regional (European) and national levels during the next two decades allows to outline three scenarios
of possible development of strategic security conditions: an integration scenario – with prevailing
positive and desirable phenomena and tendencies, indicating successive strengthening of the existing
international security system; a disintegration scenario – with prevailing unfavourable and dangerous
external and internal phenomena, indicating gradual degradation or even breakdown of the existing
security system; and an evolutionary scenario – assuming the continuation of the relative balance
between positive and negative phenomena, which would mean the continuation of the existing relative instability of international security characterized by irregular outbreaks of crises and attempts to
manage them on a short-term basis.

Th e evolutionary scenario is considered most likely.

Concept of strategic activities (operational strategy)

Poland’s security situation, which changes constantly under the infl uence of both opportunities
in the external and internal environment and new challenges and threats, requires an adjustment of
the state’s strategy of activities (operational strategy), so that it guarantees the optimum attainment of
strategic objectives under any conditions.

In accordance with the outlook scenarios concerning the development of the security environment, **three** **options of Poland’s operational strategy can be outlined: an option of maximum**
internationalization of Poland’s security, which corresponds to the integration scenario; an option of
strategic autarky (self-reliance and self-suffi ciency) which refers to the disintegration scenario; and
an option of sustainable internationalization and autonomy of Poland’s security corresponding to the
evolutionary scenario.

Th e third option is recommended, taking into account, however, the readiness to implement
the other options, if possible or required. It means that the strategic security activities should focus on
the following three main priorities:

-  remaining determined and ready to act in the full spectrum of fi elds, areas, and sectors of national
security, including especially these in which the allied operations can be diffi cult;

-  strengthening the international security community by intensifying integration processes in the
Euro-Atlantic area, based on shared interests and values, especially within NATO’s collective defence system, the EU’s Common Security and Defence Policy, and strategic partnerships (including
with the USA) as well as – within their frameworks – the strategic neighbourliness;


-----

SYNTHESIS

-  supporting and selectively participating in international operations aimed at preventing the emergence of new sources of threats or the spread of existing crises to supra-regional level, based on
a explicit international mandate.

Th e above-mentioned operational priorities should be further developed in the next National
Security Strategy of the Republic of Poland and later in the Political and Strategic Defence Directive of
the Republic of Poland (or in a Political and Strategic Directive on the National Security of the Republic of Poland, extended to non-military issues).

Concept of preparing the national security system (preparatory
strategy)

In accordance with the possible variants of the operational strategy, three options of the preparatory strategy can be formulated: internationalization of the national security system (corresponding
to the option of maximum internationalization of Poland’s security), an autonomy of the national
security system (corresponding to the option of strategic autarchy), and sustainable integration of the
national security system (corresponding to the option of sustainable internationalization and autonomy of Poland’s security).

Th e latter option, i.e. the sustainable integration of the national security system, is considered the most reasonable. Th is option consists in preparing the security system both for seizing the
opportunities resulting from international cooperation and for the rational development of capabilities in order to oppose military and non-military threats jointly with allies or individually, if need be.
A particular strategic specialty of the Polish security system should be its counter-surprise capabilities.
Th is is an extrapolation of the already initiated processes of transforming the security system. Its implementation, however, must also take into account the conceptual and planning preparations for the
two other options, if possible or necessary.

Considering the option of sustainable integration of the national security system reasonable
and realistic, the following major tasks regarding the preparation (maintenance, streamlining, and
transformation) of this system can be specifi ed: establishing the legal and organizational basis for
the integrated national security system; currently, its subsystems (and their components) function in
separation from each other, and the legal bases are incomplete and dispersed; setting the rules and
procedures for political and strategic control over the national security system, uniform in all security
conditions (the control subsystem). In this way, the synergy of the national security system will be
achieved as a result of the integration of the national security control subsystem, professionalization
of operational (defence and protection) subsystems, as well as the universal preparation of support
subsystems (societal and economic).

Th e aforesaid objectives for the preparation of the national security system of the Republic of
Poland are comprehensive and refl ect interests and needs of the state and population. Th eir aim is
to ensure greater eff ectiveness, remove the duplication of responsibilities, and allow a more rational
managing of funds allocated for national security purposes.

Th e vast majority of recommendations can be implemented within the existing constitutional
order. Further–going changes in the national security system would require constitutional changes.

INTRODUCTION

Th e White Book on National Security of the Republic of Poland has been conceived as a publicly available presentation which popularises the outcome of the National Security Strategic Review.

Th e obligation to conduct the NSSR was set out in the 2007 National Security Strategy of the Republic of Poland. In accordance with the said document, the President of the Republic of Poland decided to
conduct the Review and issued a relevant order on 24 November 2010. At the same time, he entrusted
this task to the head of the NSSR Commission. Th e Commission was chaired by the Head of the National
Security Bureau. Pursuant to the order of the President of the Republic of Poland, the Head of the National
Security Bureau determined the substantive and organizational details pertaining to conducting the NSSR.

Th e aim of the Review was to assess comprehensively Poland’s national security and formulate
conclusions regarding the state’s strategic objectives and practices in the fi eld of security as the preparation of the national security system. In accordance with the task defi ned in such a way, the concept
of the Review and the range of issues to be covered were determined.

Th e concept was based on a holistic approach to security, which allowed to identify its specifi c
areas such as: defence, protection, society, and economy, to which specifi c sectors were assigned along
with entities executing national security strategic tasks (fi g. 1). In order to harmonize the approach to
the issues analyzed and the manner of presenting them, a catalogue of basic security terms has been
prepared. Th e said catalogue constitutes appendix no. 2 to this publication.

Th e fi rst stage involved the diagnosis of Poland as a national security entity, on the basis of
which a catalogue of national interests and strategic objectives in the fi eld of security was drawn up
(the diagnosis was supported by an analysis of fundamental legal acts on national security – a list of
these acts is contained in appendix No. 3). Th e second stage consisted in the comprehensive analysis
of the security environment at global, regional, and national level, taking into account its military and
non-military spheres, as well as in the determination of possible strategic scenarios of the development
of future security conditions in Poland. During the third stage, possible and desirable options for the
concept of strategic activities (operational strategy) were prepared: the rules and ways of achieving
strategic security objectives were indicated and the tasks associated with strategic activities in specifi c
security sectors were outlined. Th e fourth stage focused on the designing – in accordance with the
tasks and requirements defi ned during the third stage – of the strategic options for the state’s preparations in the fi eld of security (preparatory strategy). Th e process is synthetically illustrated in fi g.3.

Th e Review has taken into account the results of the government’s work on integrated development strategies (including, in particular, the Strategy for the Development of the National Security
System of the Republic of Poland 2022) as well as the Long-term and Medium-term Strategy for the
Development of the State.

Th e Advisory Team provided substantial support to the problem area teams by preparing
relevant expertise and consultations on results of their respective work. Th e Commission Staff, which
was organized on the basis of the National Security Bureau, provided organizational and substantial
assistance to all entities involved in the Review. It was also responsible for the fi nal editing of the
Report of the NSSR Commission.

As a part of the commission work, numerous plenary conferences, problem-focused seminars
and workshops on the issues assigned to specifi c teams took place. Th eir aim was to facilitate the
exchange of opinions and help to formulate conclusions, which were later included in the fi nal documents of the Review.

INTRODUCTION

Th e Review brought together a wide range of representatives of various communities, including
the central and local government structures, non-governmental organizations and academic communities dealing with the security issues, parliamentary commissions responsible for security, former
heads of the National Security Bureau as well as independent experts in various areas of security. Such
a representative group provided an opportunity for professional, comprehensive and open discussion
on the national security issues, including the achievements of major scientifi c and academic institutions and non-governmental organizations in this fi eld.

Proceeding from the analysis conducted, a classifi ed Report of the National Security Strategic
Review Commission was drawn up, containing key conclusions and recommendations. In the coming
years, these conclusions and recommendations will be used as the basis for the preparation of substantial proposals to be decided by the President of the Republic of Poland and the Council of Ministers
and aimed at ensuring security and improving the national security system, including in particular the
verifi cation of the National Security Strategy of the Republic of Poland, the Political and Strategic Defence Directive of the Republic of Poland (or the Political and Strategic Directive of National Security
of the Republic of Poland, which also covers the non-military issues), as well as other documents of
strategic signifi cance.

Th e Report provided the substantial basis for the National Security Bureau to issue this White
Book. It is intended to reach a wide audience, not only institutions responsible for security issues by
law or obligation, but also all other state and non-state public and economic entities and citizens for
whom, in the globalizing world and “information-absorbing” society, security becomes the area of
challenges, threats, and risks which aff ect them directly. Everyone must therefore, as a minimum, not
only feel secure but also understand security and, to an increasingly large extent, both make individual
decisions and participate in collective decision-making. Th at is why the broadly understood education
for security has become one of the most critical tasks. Th e main purpose of the present White Book is
to make a substantial contribution to the implementation of the aforementioned task, which is of key
importance for the security of Poland.

DIAGNOSIS OF THE STATE OF NATIONAL SECURITY

Th e starting point of any comprehensive national security study is a diagnosis of the state’s
strategic potential as a security entity. Th is is a basic step allowing to formulate national interests and
resulting strategic objectives in the fi eld of national security.

Consequently, when analysing the state of Poland’s security, it is necessary fi rst of all to answer
the questions about its strategic potential: what characterises Poland as a security entity, what is its
strategic potential, and in what way does that infl uence its national interests and resulting strategic objectives in the fi eld of security? Th at is why the present chapter takes up three main themes. Th e fi rst one
elaborates on the development of national identity and statehood as well as of their impact on national
interests and strategic objectives in the fi eld of security. Th e analysis covers the period from the origins
of the state to the modern times. Th e second theme broaches the constitutional and political conditions
of the Republic of Poland and assesses Poland’s strategic potential in four areas: defence, protection,
society, and economy. Th e third theme identifi es and formulates a catalogue of national interests and
strategic objectives in the fi eld of security. Th is catalogue serves as a reference point for the discussion
of the outlook for the development of security environment at an international and national level as well
as for the formulation of the possible and desirable options of the operational and preparatory strategy.

### WHITE BOOKTON NATIONAL SECURITY OF THE REPUBLIC OF POLAND

1.1. Historical evolution of Poland’s security

From the very beginning of Poland as a state, the decisive factor for its survival and development was – apart from the internal sphere (system, the military, economy, human potential, etc.) –
its ability to build a friendly international environment using a wide range of political, military, and
economic tools. In this context, what became particularly important for ensuring security was – at
an external level – eff ective diplomatic and military activities (being an important element of skilful
foreign policy of the state) and – at an internal level – the shaping of a national identity and statehood.

Th e contemporary national interests and strategic objectives in the fi eld of security ought to
be defi ned on the basis of historical experience, as it shows the ways in which customs, habits, orientations, and beliefs regarding the needs and conditions for the existence and decent life among other
peoples have been engraved in the awareness, memory, and character of the Polish nation. In this
way the national policy relating to identity, functioning, and strengthening of the state as well as safeguarding its territorial integrity was formed.

From the early years of statehood to the partition period

Th e main national interests (in the contemporary understanding of this category) at the dawn
of statehood were focused on the survival of the Polish state, especially in the context of the civilization and military pressures coming from the west. Th ese interests were advanced by the adoption of
Christianity. Th e strategic security objectives of Poland under the fi rst, Piast, dynasty were aimed at:
maintaining statehood under the rule of the Piasts and, simultaneously, repelling the threat of German
expansion; wielding more eff ective internal control over individual provinces of the state; protecting
the integrity of the state in the face of external threats (Baltic tribes, the Mongols, the Teutonic Order);
developing the defence infrastructure; creating optimum conditions for legal, administrative, and economic development of the state as well as strengthening of its international position through active
foreign policy, oft en supported with the country’s own or coalition-based military operations.

During the Jagiellonian era, the concept of security policy was based on cooperation with
neighbours and territorial expansion, fi nding its expression in the personal union with neighbouring
countries (Hungary, Lithuania). Th e alliances moved the borders and interests to the east, making Poland reorient its interests towards the areas of Rus and Lithuania, but they also were the confi rmation
of Poland’s signifi cant ability to form coalitions (Grunwald, 1410).

Th e most important strategic interest of Poland under the Jagiellonian dynasty (1385–1572) was
concentrated on the integration of diff erent nationalities into one community of the Polish Commonwealth. Th e main strategic objectives of the Polish state in the fi eld of security included: strengthening the
military and demographic potential through the union of Poland and Lithuania; neutralizing and later
removing the threat to the autonomy and integrity of the state from the Teutonic Order as well as consolidating the international position of Poland as a regional power, thereby forming a kind of counterbalance to the expansion policy of other regional strategic players in this part of the continent (Germans,
the uniting Russia, the Ottoman Empire). At the same time, the Polish gentry gaining new privileges laid
down the foundations for the gentry’s democracy, which was a phenomenon in Europe, as well as the
base for the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth’s political and military might in the 16[th] century.


-----

DIAGNOSIS OF THE STATE OF NATIONAL SECURITY

In the 17[th] century, the security problems of the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth were to
a signifi cant extent associated with the multi-ethnicity of the state. Confl icts of interests between the
Polish nobility and the subjects in the borderlands triggered the Cossack rebellions, weakening the
Polish state internally. Additionally, the state was devastated by confl icts with Sweden, Russia, and
Turkey. Th e more limited was the power of elective kings, the weaker was the international position of
the Polish Commonwealth (cf. liberum veto). Th e last positive note of eff ective foreign policy was the
rule of John III Sobieski. Th e personal union with weak Saxony resulting from the election of Augustus
II the Strong as the king of Poland (1697), and later of his son Augustus III (1734), did not strengthen
Poland which at that time was devastated by wars. Th e Polish magnates and gentry, who feared strong
royal powers and obstructed or contested reforms, objectively weakened the authority and might of
the state.

In the 18[th] century, Poland was successively becoming the sphere of infl uence of neighbouring
powers which, at Poland’s expense, advanced their interests. During the Great Northern War (17001721), the Polish kingdom was the object rather than the subject of the strategic play in the region and
Polish lands became the scene of battles and marches of foreign troops. Th e dependence on Russia was
growing. In that part of Europe it was no longer Poland who fought war with Russia and Sweden, as
was the case in 16[th] and 17[th] century, but Sweden who fought Russia. Th e attempts to reform the political system, for which appealed Stanislaw Konarski in the fi rst half of the 18[th] century, were launched
following the ideals of the European Enlightenment under the rule of Stanislaw August Poniatowski.
In this period the state authorities placed great emphasis on the development of culture and art, thus
strengthening the national identity. Th e restoration of the Republic of Poland was accelerated aft er the
shock of the fi rst partition (1772). A series of internal reforms (e.g. the establishment of the Commission of National Education and of the Corps of Cadets) was undermined by the factions of gentry and
magnates who, defending their interests, even in good faith (protecting themselves against the allegedly absolute power of the king), objectively weakened the state (the Bar Confederation). Th e favourable international situation (the Russo–Turkish War and disputes among the partitioning powers) was
taken advantage of by the patriotic party during the Four-Year Sejm held in Warsaw between 1788 and
1792. It instituted far-reaching reforms, the most important of which was the adoption of the Constitution of May 3, 1791, setting forth the basis for a new political system of the Polish kingdom, as well
as the resolution on augmenting the army to 100 thousand soldiers. Th e reforms were soon brought
down by the treacherous Confederation of Targowica (despite the insurgent rebellion – the Kościuszko
Insurrection) and partitions executed by the neighbouring powers in 1793 and 1795.

To sum up, aft er the times of division of the state and the overcoming of it, followed by the
period of prosperity, especially in the 16[th] century, from the mid-17[th ]century on the eff ectiveness of
pursuing national interests was being hampered despite individual, meaningful military successes (the
Vienna battle, 1683).

Conclusions from that period from the point of view of current interests and strategic objectives can be summarized as follows: the vital interest is to be capable of organizing and maintaining
an eff ective state; the balance between the freedom of an individual or a group and the responsibility for the country must not be disturbed; the cultivation of national identity must be continuously
pursued; and unfavourable commonality of interests among neighbouring powers must be eff ectively
countered.

### WHITE BOOKTON NATIONAL SECURITY OF THE REPUBLIC OF POLAND

Th e period of partitions and regaining of independence

Th e critical national interest in the period of partitions was to maintain the national identity,
cultivate the Polish language and resists the programmes of Germanization and Russifi cation. Th e problem of Poles’ national identity during the period of partitions (between 1795 and 1918) was particularly
complex due to the loss of independence. Th e lack of independence along with the simultaneous transformations of the political and economic systems of the partitioned areas led to a gradual disappearance
of the “nobility nation”. Th e emergence of the contemporary Polish nation encompassing all social classes
and strata was accompanied by the enfranchisement of peasants (abolition of feudal service and personal
serfdom), urbanization and industrialization of partitioned Polish lands (the pace and scale of these phenomena varied among partitions) as well as the infl ow of people of various nationalities (Germans, Jews,
Russians). Such a situation resulted in a shift from the traditional gentry-only understanding of the Polish
national identity towards its interpretation as a modern political community, whether in the national
sense (the national movement) or the class sense (social democratic ideas).

Th e factors which were particularly important for the awakening of national awareness included education and the cultivation of the Polish language against the policies of Russifi cation and
Germanization by the respective partitioning powers, as well as the development of art, science, and
national culture. Th e reinforcement of national identity was supported by the patriotic (Romanticism)
and social (Positivism) mission of Polish literature.

Both national interests and strategic objectives of the society without a state – the Polish nation
building itself on new foundations – were oriented in individual partitions and in various forms towards: regaining independence (a nationwide objective, promoted by secret societies and in subsequent national uprisings); extending the autonomy (the Galicia region); organizing the resistance
against Germanization and Russifi cation; egalitarianism and social solidarity as well as improving the
level of awareness and quality of life of Polish communities in partitioned areas (the peasants’ issue,
the idea of organic work, positivism).

Th e period of World War I (1914–1918) showed particular determination of the nation and its
elites to build and strengthen a modern nation encompassing all social groups in every aspect – political, social, economic and cultural – in Polish lands and in exile. It also emphasized the importance of
Polish diplomacy eff orts to sustain international support for the Polish struggle for independence and
self-organization (including the military one – the Polish Legions) in the absence of a sovereign state.

Th e main conclusion that can be drawn from events of that period concerns the special role
of sustaining, cultivating, and developing the culture and national identity in the survival of a nation.

Th e interwar period and World War II

Th e main national interest in the interwar period was to build and strengthen the state. Aft er
regaining independence under the 1919 Versaille Treaty and as a result of the fi ght for the borders
of the Second Polish Republic, Poland held an important place in the Central Europe region. Th e
international position of Poland was signifi cantly enhanced by the victory in the Polish–Soviet War
(1919-1921), which for two decades stopped the expansion of communism to the west and stabilized
the political relations in Central and Eastern Europe. However, the situation of the state in terms of security guarantees from other entities in the international environment was diffi cult. Th is predicament


-----

DIAGNOSIS OF THE STATE OF NATIONAL SECURITY

resulted from the following: geopolitical conditions; submissive and inconsistent policy of western
countries (especially of Great Britain) towards Germany, associated with abolishing the constraints
imposed on Germany under the Treaty of Versailles; international isolation of the Weimar Republic
and the Bolshevik Russia and the resulting closer relations between the two powers, which was unfavourable to Poland (the Treaty of Rapallo, 1922), as well as the policy aiming at revision of the Polish
boundaries, exercised by German and Soviet diplomacy. Th e position of Poland in the region was
aff ected by bad relations with Lithuania and cool relations with Czechoslovakia. Th e relations with
Western Europe (with France in particular) suff ered a setback in 1925, when the Locarno Treaties
channelled German claims and expansion to the east. Th e British guarantees for Poland of March 1939
(and the earlier agreement with France) proved to be of little use in the face of German (1 September
1939) and, later, Soviet aggression (17 September 1939). Th at situation was the source of the betrayal
syndrome in the consciousness of the Poles. Such thinking was further reinforced by decisions taken
by the Allies “above the heads of Poles” which, aft er the end of World War II, left Poland in the Soviet
sphere of infl uence (Yalta–Potsdam agreements).

During the interwar period, Poland was a multinational state. Objective and subjective factors
in international and national policy antagonized the young state and its minorities against each other.

Th e eff ective achievement of strategic objectives in Polish security policy was hampered by
the following factors: ineff ectiveness of political and military alliances entered into by the authorities
of the Second Republic of Poland; the eff orts of German diplomacy towards the achievement of their
strategic objectives by exerting diplomatic pressure and taking military measures; the collusion between the Th ird Reich and the Soviet Union at the expense of Poland (the Molotov–Ribbentrop pact of
August 1939 and its secret protocol); signifi cant disproportions between the Polish military potential
and the German and Soviet potentials; the appeasement policy of western powers towards Germany
and diffi culties in building a state community on solid foundations, encompassing all citizens. Poland’s
security was severely aff ected by the global crisis (1929–1933) and the customs war with Germany,
which crippled the economy.

Th e fundamental Polish national interest during World War II was the physical survival of the
nation. Th e priorities also included regaining sovereignty within its pre-war borders. Th e main strategic objectives were the following: building and developing the structures of the Polish underground
state and the resistance movement at home and the military structures abroad; patriotic and historical
education of all social groups; active and passive resistance to the extermination policy and propaganda of the invader, as well as internationalizing the Polish cause and gaining the support of the Allies for Polish claims. Th e politics of the Soviet Union combined with the elimination of independent
political forces in the occupied countries of Central and Eastern Europe prevented the achievement
of strategic objectives set by the Polish government-in-exile. Th e fi nal political defeat of the Londonbased government in its fi ght “for government and borders” was the result of non-equitable treatment
of the Polish cause by the “Big Th ree” – the United Kingdom, the United States, and the Soviet Union.

Th e conclusions from that period in the context of the current interests and strategic objectives
indicate that special attention must be paid to the scope and form of cooperation between the two
powerful neighbours of Poland: Russia and Germany, as well as to ensuring that the Polish interests are
taken into account in critical areas of relations between these two powers. It is also necessary to keep
modernizing the state’s own defensive capabilities and rationally evaluate the eff ectiveness of alliances
to which Poland is a party.

### WHITE BOOKTON NATIONAL SECURITY OF THE REPUBLIC OF POLAND

Th e post-war period and the People’s Republic of Poland

As a consequence of World War II, the continuity of the statehood was broken and the country
lost its sovereignty. Th e resistance against the imposed authorities and political system, although futile,
was put up by the military and political underground. From 1945, the London-based government-in- exile was no longer recognized, while the communist government (de facto imposed on Poland
by the Soviet Union) was getting stronger, while revising the concept of national identity on the basis
of class criteria and justifying it also with the national security requirements. At least until 1956, the
communist authorities resorted to inhumane practices, and the continuously developed repression
system played a major role in these activities.
In the early years of the Polish People’s Republic (People’s Poland, PRL), the following issues
from among the national and state interests were considered to be of prime importance: building an
ideologized, “socialist” state in the absence of sovereignty; the permanence of the Oder–Neisse border between Poland and (East) Germany; internal security, which was associated, inter alia, with the
strengthening of the so-called people’s power and provided the basis for deep political, constitutional,
social, economic, and other kinds of changes.
Th e strategic objectives of the Polish People’s Republic in the fi eld of security were concentrated, above all, around maintaining power and internal order in the state at all costs (the development of
secret services, police forces (milicja), surveillance of the society, resorting to solving social problems
by force). External activities were dictated by the dependence on the Soviet Union and, comprised,
_inter alia, treaty guarantees for the post-war borders of the state, including especially the integration_
of the western and northern areas; maintaining the unity of the Eastern bloc, among others, through
participation in the Warsaw Treaty Organization (Warsaw Pact) and the build-up of the armed forces
in close cooperation with the Soviet army and other Warsaw Pact forces within the USSR’s strategic
plans (the military dimension), as well as the development of the imposed economic cooperation with
the Eastern bloc countries, including within the Council for Mutual Economic Assistance.
Activities in the non-military aspects of security were focused on the reconstruction and development of the state infrastructure; the reconstruction of the demographic potential of Poland, as
well as the improvement of the quality of social life through employment, education, health care, and
other social activities. Th e ineffi ciency of the central planning system hindered the achievement of the
majority of these objectives.
Strategic incapacitation of Poland expressed itself, inter alia, through the consent of the authorities to interference in internal aff airs of the allies of the Warsaw Pact – indirectly, in terms of politics
(Hungary, 1956), and directly, through military operations (Czechoslovakia, 1968).
In those conditions, the Polish authorities were interested in easing tensions between the blocs;
reducing the military dangers; seeking for itself a margin of political freedom in Europe, which found
expression in the plans of Rapacki (1957), Gomulka (1963) and Jaruzelski (1987); and strengthening
of Poland’s international position, inter alia, through its activity in the UN and the Conference of Security and Cooperation in Europe (CSCE).
During that period, the strategic objectives pursued by the Polish independence opposition, which
was not acknowledged by the authorities of the Polish People’s Republic, included: restoration of sovereignty
of the Polish state; real democratization of public life; rejection of the ineffi cient economic system; striving
for the improvement of the living conditions of the population; promoting truly pluralistic attitudes in the
society; ensuring the observance of human rights by the authorities; limiting the impact of the state propaganda; establishment and development of organizations defending the interests of persecuted individuals

DIAGNOSIS OF THE STATE OF NATIONAL SECURITY

and public groups; perpetrating acts of disobedience versus the communist authorities (strikes, appeals,
manifestations) as well as informing the public abroad about the situation in the country.
Th e ineffi ciency and stagnation of the national centrally-planned economy system aggravated
the national security, leading to the deterioration of the living conditions of the population (social unrests in years: 1956, 1970, 1976) as well as causing resistance of the intellectuals and students (March
1968) and giving rise to the nation-wide movement of “Solidarity” (“Solidarność”) (1980). In the face
of the deteriorating situation in years 1980–1981, the state authorities did not hesitate to declare martial law (13 December 1981), which impeded the democratic aspirations of the opposition.
In the deteriorating social and economic situation, the security policy of the Polish People’s
Republic in its fi nal years was focused on the internal sphere, ultimately leading to a “round table”
dialogue of the authorities with the opposition (6 February – 5 April 1989). It was agreed that the partially-free contract parliamentary elections would be held on 4 June 1989. As a result of the resounding
victory of the opposition, a peaceful transition of power took place and, on 12 September 1989, a new
government was formed by Tadeusz Mazowiecki, which initiated the process of transformation of the
entire state. Th e changes were confi rmed aft er the election of Lech Wałęsa as president of the Republic
of Poland in 1990 and the fi rst fully free parliamentary election of 27 October 1991.
Th e advancement of national interests in the post-war period was impossible due to Poland’s
dependence on the Soviet Union and the country’s strategic incapacitation. Although the survival of
the Polish nation and state was not at risk, its development and strengthening of the international
position were limited and conditioned by the interests and directions of policy and strategy of the
Soviet Union. Th e activity of the opposition groups in Poland, the deteriorating economic situation,
the overall “fatigue” (exhaustion) of the communist system, and changes in the geopolitical situation
(especially aft er Mikhail Gorbachev took power in the USSR in 1985) led to a peaceful restoration of
strategic autonomy and the change of the state’s system.
Despite its satellite role (and domination of the ideology alien to Poles), the Polish People’s Republic was seeking every opportunity to mark its subjectivity (e.g. in the CSCE process). Importantly,
the territorial integrity of the country was strengthened by the conclusion of a relevant treaty with the
Federal Republic of Germany, which normalized mutual relations (1970).
Conclusions from this period in the context of the current national interests and strategic
objectives indicate that maintaining national sovereignty remains one of the key tasks of the state,
while non-democratic (satellite) political and military alliances may turn out to be not a measure of
strengthening the security but rather an instrument of enslavement and strategic incapacitation by the
hegemon of such an alliance.

Th e Th ird Republic

Th e collapse of the Cold-War bi-polar international order was a result of the “Solidarity” revolution initiated in Poland in 1980, the transformations in the Soviet Union aft er the assumption of power
by Mikhail Gorbachev and, later, the “Autumn of Nations” in 1989. Th is process ushered in the change
of the political and economic system of the Republic of Poland, while determining its security situation.

Aft er Poland regained its full sovereignty, its main national interests included guaranteeing the security of the state under the new conditions (aft er the downfall of the Eastern bloc Poland found itself in a “grey
security” zone), the sustainable development, and the gradual growth of the international position, including
through membership in the most powerful organizations in the world – NATO and the European Union.

### WHITE BOOKTON NATIONAL SECURITY OF THE REPUBLIC OF POLAND

Th e strategic objectives of Poland in the fi eld of security were the following: the strengthening
of the state’s own defence potential in the conditions of strategic autonomy while simultaneously
seeking new strategic partners in the West (applying for membership in NATO and the EU as well
as developing relations with the USA), making the Soviet army leave the territory of Poland, and
conducting foreign policy in such a way that it contributes to the building of a stable and peaceful
international environment. In the non-military sphere, the strategic objective was the development of
economy based on free market principles.
As a result of the strategic work in the late 1980s and early 1990s, the Defensive Doctrine of the
Republic of Poland was developed and later adopted by a resolution of the State Defence Committee
(Komitet Obrony Kraju, KOK) of 21 February 1990. It was the fi rst unclassifi ed document in the post-war history of Poland, which determined and publicly declared the basic elements of its national
defence strategy.
Later, on 2 November 1992, two other documents were adopted at the KOK’s meeting – the
Polish Defence Policy Objectives as well as the Security Policy and Defence Strategy of the Republic of
Poland. Th e executive document was the Plan of Defence of the Republic of Poland, outlining specifi c
operational tasks of the state structures in the area of security, including various possible scenarios
under the conditions of strategic autonomy.
Other key state documents integrating the strategy of security and defence were adopted aft er
Poland joined the North Atlantic Treaty Organization, including the National Security Strategy of the
Republic of Poland (4 January 2000) and the Defence Strategy of the Republic of Poland (23 May 2000).
In the aft ermath of the events of 11 September 2001 (terrorist attacks on New York and the Pentagon)
and subsequent measures taken by the anti-terrorist coalition, and also as a result of the crisis over Iraq in
2002–2003, the said documents became outdated. Th ey were therefore replaced by the National Security
Strategy of the Republic of Poland (8 September 2003). In 2007, in turn, the National Security Strategy of
the Republic of Poland was adopted, where, for the fi rst time, the issue of security was approached from
a broader perspective, taking into consideration not only its military aspects but also the non-military
ones. Next, in 2009, an executive document was approved – the Political and Strategic Defence Directive
of the Republic of Poland. Th ese aforementioned documents, based on provisions of the Constitution of
the Republic of Poland and other legal acts, were the interpretation of the basic strategic tenets in the fi eld
of security of Poland as the member of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization and the European Union.
In addition, they provided the conceptual basis for further detailed planning, programme, and doctrinal
work relating to the preparation and use of the state’s defence potential in peace, crisis, and war.
Th e period of the Polish Th ird Republic has also marked a break with the ideological approach to national identity. Th is meant the return to traditional elements, such as the sense of common
history, special role of Catholicism and Christian traditions, as well as a strong rooting in history and
simultaneous rebirth of cultural and civilization ties with the West. It has found its symbolic expression, inter alia, in the restoration of the image of the white eagle wearing a golden crown on the coat
of arms of the Republic of Poland.
Th e process of strengthening the Th ird Republic is expressed in particular in: the democratization
and reinforcement of the free market economy; striving for gradual integration with the countries of Western
Europe in the political, economic, social, and military contexts as well as close cooperation with the United
States; political activity towards other countries in the region; the promotion of democracy in Ukraine and
Belarus; the development of political and military cooperation with neighbouring countries; regional initiatives (the Weimar Triangle: France, Germany, and Poland; the Visegrád Group: the Czech Republic, Hungary, Poland and Slovakia), or efforts to develop partnership relations with Russia on equal terms.


-----

DIAGNOSIS OF THE STATE OF NATIONAL SECURITY

Th e majority of strategic objectives of the Republic of Poland, which were set aft er 1989 have
been accomplished. Poland joined the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (1999) and the European
Union (2004); established strategic partnership with the United States; got engaged in sub-regional
cooperation (the Weimar Triangle; the Visegrád Group, the Central European Initiative, the Council
of the Baltic Sea States); and became more involved in international stabilization operations, thereby
increasing the level of interoperability of the Polish Armed Forces.

Th e fact that not all of the strategic objectives have been achieved is evidenced by: the mixed
balance sheet of relations with Russia (particularly in regarding non-military aspects of security –
energy industry, historical policy) as well as the deterioration of relations with Belarus.

Historically, the geopolitical location of Poland between the East and the West has predominantly shaped the Polish national identity and statehood, determining the nature of national interests
and objectives in the fi eld security (fi g. 5).

Due to external wars and other crises, the policy and activities of authorities and the population
were concentrated around the issues of security for a long time in Polish history. Ignoring such issues
led either to marginalization on the international scene (the division into duchies period, the rule of
the Saxon Dynasty) or total collapse of the state (the partition period, World War II). Th e history also
shows the importance of right proportions between particular interests (of an individual) and collective interests (of the state) as well as between material interests and intangible (spiritual) interests.
Th e prevalence of individual or particular interests (dynastic interests, the gentry’s “golden freedom”/
anarchy, etc.) over the national ones led to a number of crises and undermined the international subjectivity of Poland, as well as resulted in the collapse of the Polish state (fragmentation and partitions).

History teaches an important lesson that the survival of the Polish nation, also in the period
when it did not have its own state, was possible owing to the cultivation of the language, tradition,
culture, and art, all of them strengthening the national identity.

### WHITE BOOKTON NATIONAL SECURITY OF THE REPUBLIC OF POLAND

Th e history of Poland says also a lot about the reliability of allied and coalition commitments.
Simply making or signing such commitments did not guarantee the real help in the time of trial, as
evidenced by September 1939. It is therefore critical, on the one hand, to make consistent eff orts to
maintain the credibility, cohesiveness and strength of organizations of which Poland is a member, and,
on the other hand, to strive to build the state’s own security potential.

1.2. Poland’s security potential

National security system

Th e national security system is not optimal. Th e 2007 National Security Strategy of the Republic of Poland does not defi ne the system in full, but merely indicates a number of various partial
subsystems.

In the present White Book, the national security system (that of security of the state) is understood as the entirety of resources, means and forces (entities) earmarked by the state for the performance
of tasks in the fi eld of security, organized (into subsystems and components), maintained and prepared
in a manner adequate to the purpose of performing such tasks. Th e system consists of a control system
(subsystem) as well as a number of executive subsystems (systems), including operational subsystems
(defence and protection) and support subsystems (societal and economic subsystems). Its structure is
presented graphically in fi gure 6.

DIAGNOSIS OF THE STATE OF NATIONAL SECURITY

As the entire state, the national security system of the Republic of Poland has a territorial structure. In this sense, the commune (gmina), district (powiat), and province (województwo) subsystems
of territorial security can be identifi ed. Given the functional structure of the state, there are ministerial
(departmental) security systems.

Th e nationality security system is multi-layered and multidimensional. It takes into account the
shaping of relations within the state and the state’s relations with external entities, as well as it covers
their diff erent spheres and levels: political, legal, military, economic, social, cultural, scientifi c and other
relations.

Controlling national security is one of the most important functions of the state the aim of
which is to ensure its existence and development under the changing conditions of the security environment. Th ere are three basic elements of the national security control: control of defence of the state
(the competence of the President of the Republic of Poland acting in cooperation with the Council of
Ministers), general security control (the competence of the Council of Ministers), and crisis management (the competence of the Council of Ministers, province governors (wojewoda), district governors
(starosta), commune heads (wójt), town mayors and presidents).

Th e control subsystem is the key element of the national security system. It is the part of the national security system designed for the purposes of controlling the functioning thereof, encompassing
public authorities and heads of organizational units which perform tasks related to national security
(including the command authorities of the Polish Armed Forces), along with advisory bodies and administrative (staff ) apparatus as well as operating procedures and infrastructure (control and management positions and centres, communication system). Th e control subsystem is of vital importance for
the entire security system in times of peace, crisis, and war. Th e subsystem ensures the identifi cation
of threats and their analysis, the planning of preparations and activities of the operational and support
subsystems and their management (command) during operations.

Th ere are four strategic task areas of the control subsystem. Th e fi rst one concerns monitoring
of threats, including their scale, type, and location. Th e second one deals with preventing the emergence of threats in the territory of the state and abroad. Th e third one includes the removal of relevant
dangers, if the threats were not prevented. Th e fi nal task area concerns the control of defence of the
state in case of direct military aggression.

Th e fulfi lment of these tasks requires adequate planning, organizational, fi nancial and technical
conditions. Such conditions, in turn, are ensured by legal regulations aimed at increasing the defence
readiness of the state and preparing a system of command positions for specifi c public administration
authorities, including the Central Control Post of the State Defence.

**Executive subsystems (including components) the means and forces earmarked for the**
performance of statutory tasks in the fi eld of security which remain available to security control
authorities. Th ere are two kinds of such subsystems: operational subsystems and support subsystems.

Operational subsystems consist of: the state’s defence subsystem (defence, national defence,
military security) – designed to seize opportunities, face challenges, reduce risks and counter (prevent
and resist) external threats of a politico-military nature – as well as the state and civil protection subsystems (non-military, civil security) – designed to seize opportunities, face challenges, reduce risks,
and counter (prevent and resist) external and internal threats of a non-military (civil) nature.


-----

### WHITE BOOKTON NATIONAL SECURITY OF THE REPUBLIC OF POLAND

Th e support subsystems are societal and economic entities, the aim of which is to seize opportunities, face challenges, reduce risks, and counter (prevent and resist) external and internal threats of
a socio-economic nature, as well as to support socially and economically the operational subsystems
of national security in times of peace, crisis, and war.

As stated before, the security system is not yet organized in an optimal way, the major challenge
being the proper integration of its elements.

Political system conditions as the basis
of the management potential

Th e basis for the national security control subsystem is the political system conditions the legal
foundations of which are laid down in the Constitution of the Republic of Poland of 2 April 1997.
Article 5 which lays down the basic functions of the state, is key in this regard.

In accordance with the said article, the Republic of Poland preserves the independence and
integrity of its territory (the state as a national political organization), ensures the freedoms and rights
of persons and citizens as well as the security of the citizens (a citizen as the unitary element of the
nation), safeguards the national heritage (the intangible potential, the constant component of which
is the cultural and historical heritage) as well as provides the protection of the natural environment
pursuant to the principles of sustainable development (the material potential, built in the course of
the social and economic development, taking into account the need for the protection of the natural
environment). Th ese functions determine specifi c responsibilities and tasks of the state authorities.
Preserving the independence and territorial integrity of the state – even in view of the scheme of the
basic law – is the state’s key function, the implementation of which allows for fulfi lling of other functions defi ned as fundamental in Article 5.

As regards preservation of independence, ter
**Th e Constitution of the Republic** ritorial integrity and national security, the provision
**of Poland of 2 April 1997** of aforementioned Article 5 of the Constitution of the

Republic of Poland corresponds closely with the stand
**Art. 5. Th e Republic of Poland shall** ard set in Article 26, para. 1 of the Constitution, which
safeguard the independence and determines the system position of the Polish Armed
integrity of its territory and ensure the Forces. By ascribing the Polish Armed Forces the role of

of sustainable development.

Within the framework of the political system
conditions, the Polish Constitution contains provisions
which determine the system founding principles of the Republic of Poland. Th e following tenets are of
particular importance: a democratic state of law realizing the principles of social justice; a unitary nature
of the state; the supreme power of the nation; sustainable development; access to national cultural heritage; the rule of law; separation of and balance among public powers (legislative, executive and judicial);


-----

DIAGNOSIS OF THE STATE OF NATIONAL SECURITY

political pluralism; freedom of association; freedom of the press and of other means of social communication; decentralization; a social market economy and the freedom of economic activity; the neutrality of
the Armed Forces in political matters and their being subject to civil and democratic control.

Th e institutional and functional conditions in the sphere of security are determined by the
constitutional principle of separation and balance among the branches – the legislative (the Sejm and
the Senate), the executive (the President of the Republic of Poland and the Council of Ministers), and
the judiciary (courts and tribunals). Th e structure of the executive in the state is of basic importance
for the shaping of solutions in the security system.

Th e position of the President of the Republic of Poland is defi ned under Article 126 of the
Constitution, in accordance with which the President is the supreme representative of the Republic of
Poland and the guarantor of the continuity of state authority, ensures observance of the Constitution,
safeguards the sovereignty and security of the state as well as the inviolability and integrity of its territory. Th e functions performed by the President correspond therefore to Article 5 of the Constitution,
making the head of the state the guardian of the basic values of the state such as sovereignty, territorial
integrity, and external and internal security. Important in this context is the provision of Article 134
of the Constitution which – by entrusting the supreme command of the Polish Armed Forces to the
President – determines the position of the head of the state in relation to the apparatus appointed to
perform the most important function of the state. Th e position of the President of the Republic of
Poland in the security system is confi rmed under Article 135 of the Constitution, pursuant to which
the National Security Council is an advisory body to the President regarding internal and external
security of the state. Th e responsibilities and instruments of the President concerning the issues of
security – with the exclusion of extraordinary measures – fall within the general powers provided for
in the constitutional and statutory standards. In order for the President of the Republic of Poland to
fulfi l his constitutional functions, it is essential that the President has the powers to: approve, at request
of the Prime Minister, the National Security Strategy of the Republic of Poland as well as to issue, also
at request of the Prime Minister and by way of a decision, the Political and Strategic Defence Directive
of the Republic of Poland. In addition, the President, by way of a decision issued at the request of the
minister of national defence, determines the key objectives of the development of the Armed Forces
and their preparation to defend the state as well as, on the motion of the Council of Ministers, decides
about the deployment of the Polish military contingents abroad.

It should be stressed that the function of the state regarding security as defi ned in Article 5 of
the Constitution is transferred to the Council of Ministers competence under Article 146 para. 1 of the
Constitution. In the light of provisions of this article, the Council of Ministers conducts the internal
aff airs and foreign policy of the Republic of Poland. Detailed objectives of the Council of Ministers defi ned in the Constitution and therefore considered particularly important include ensuring the internal security of the state and public order (Article 146 para. 4 item 7 of the Constitution of the Republic
of Poland), ensuring the external security of the state (Article 146 para. 4 item 8), as well as exercising
general control in the fi eld of national defence and annually specifying the number of citizens who are
required to perform active military service (Article 146 para. 4 item 11).

Th e development of the strategic concept and national security system is guided by the constitutional principles of the rule of law, supremacy and direct applicability of the provisions of the Constitution of the Republic of Poland, as well as observance of international law by Poland. Th e public
authorities shall function on the basis and within the limits of the law.


-----

### WHITE BOOKTON NATIONAL SECURITY OF THE REPUBLIC OF POLAND

Th e contents of the constitutional catalogue of rights, freedoms, and obligations of persons and
citizens set a framework for defi ning the system objectives and solutions in the fi eld of security.

Th e strategic concept and the national security system must be developed taking into account,
in particular, the rights of every person, as listed: protection of life; legal protection of their private and
family life; making decisions about their personal life; rearing their children in accordance with their own
convictions; not disclosing information concerning them and their philosophy of life, religious convictions or belief; having access to the public service based on the principle of equality; obtaining information on the activities of public authorities as well as foreigners’ right of asylum or right to obtain the status
of a refugee. It also concerns numerous freedoms, especially the freedom of: communication; movement
within the territory of the Republic of Poland and leaving it; choice of place of residence and sojourn;
expressing opinions; assembly and association, as well as the prohibition (excluding the cases defi ned in
the Constitution of the Republic of Poland) of extradition of a Polish citizen.

Important circumstances when designing the security-related solutions include: establishing, under
the Constitution of the Republic of Poland, of a broad catalogue of measures for the protection of rights and
freedoms; identifying clearly which of them can be claimed directly under the Constitution of the Republic
of Poland; establishing the rules and procedures for introducing extraordinary measures (martial law, a state
of emergency, a state of natural disaster) as well as specifying the admissible degree to which the freedoms
and rights of persons and citizens may be subjected to limitation for the duration of extraordinary measures.

In the context of developing the strategic concept and preparing (maintaining and transforming) the national security system, the state of law is a problem in itself. In the fi eld of security, the
Polish legal system lacks comprehensive regulations of statutory nature. Th e regulations are scattered
among various acts, lack a systematic character, and do not refl ect in a suffi cient manner the changing
notion of national security associated with the growing importance of its non-military dimension.

**Party system. Th e fundamentals of the party system are laid down by the constitutional prin-**
ciples of a democratic state and political pluralism. Th e boundaries of the party system are marked by
the constitutional prohibition of the existence of political parties and other organizations whose programmes are advocate totalitarian methods and Nazi, fascist or communist practices, as well as those
whose programmes or activities assume or acknowledges racial or national hatred, the use of violence
aimed at obtaining power or infl uencing the state policy, or provide for the secrecy of their own structure or membership. Th e constitutional principle that the fi nancing of political parties is open to public
inspection is essential from the perspective of political security.

Th e characteristic feature of the political scene is its multi-party nature, and this feature appears
permanent. At the programme level, apart from the traditional division between the left and the right
there is – and will continue to be – a partially overlapping (and even countervailing) division into supporters of solutions leaning toward traditionally-understood interests of the nation-state and, on the
other hand, those advocating the broadest possible international and supranational cooperation, including in the framework of the European integration process. Th e European Union and in particular
its institutional and functional consolidation becomes, under such conditions, the subject of dispute
between proponents of European integration and Euro-sceptics, which reshapes the political scene.

**Local government. An important factor in developing the security strategy is, in accordance**
with the constitutional principle of decentralization, the share of local government in the exercise of
public power as well as the execution by local government of the substantial part of public duties which
it is empowered to discharge by law.


-----

DIAGNOSIS OF THE STATE OF NATIONAL SECURITY

Th e tasks associated with the public security, including public order, and citizens’ safety, are
carried out by local government units at commune and district level as its direct responsibility. As
a result, the coordination and allotting of tasks in this fi eld can be done only in accordance with the
provisions of generally applicable law. Th e strong position of local self-government, particularly at the
level of communes and districts – which are the territorial units in which only local public administration authorities of general jurisdiction can function – is further accentuated by the rule of locally
combined administration. Th e supervision by the central administration over the activities of the local
government is, in principle, except for a situation when extraordinary measures have been introduced,
limited by the provisions of the Constitution of the Republic of Poland to the criterion of legality.

**Non-governmental organizations. Non-governmental organizations (NGOs) are an element**
of public space, which, to a certain extent, aff ects the national security system. In accordance with
the principle of freedom of association, there exist trade unions, socio-occupational organizations,
societies, citizens’ movements, as well as other voluntary associations and foundations. In addition,
on the basis of laws, there are self-governments created within a profession in which the public repose
confi dence, which concern themselves with the due practice of such professions in accordance with
and for the purpose of protecting the public interest. Th e best chance for the national security system
associated with the existence of non-governmental organizations is that they are established, function,
and fulfi l their statutory objectives spontaneously, at grass-root level, and consequently – that the civil
society is being built, whose members feel jointly responsible for important matters, either at the local
community or state level.

Poland’s experience resulting from NGOs activities is not long enough to allow elaboration of
eff ective cooperation mechanisms between such organizations and the administration. It means that
despite the implementation of solutions in the fi eld of public benefi t, they are not suffi ciently involved
in carrying out public tasks, including the measures taken to ensure national security. Above all, the
third sector is noticed in the context of security when sudden disasters befall, but its role in daily activity is underestimated.

Th e activities of non-governmental organizations contributing to ensuring security include
both their involvement in the measures directly improving the security of the state (e.g. in the case of
Voluntary Fire Brigades, for which the security system provides the protective, interventional, educational, and cultural functions) and their indirect involvement (e.g. think tanks suggesting directions
of security policy of Poland, organizations combating pathological phenomena – such as corruption,
foundations supporting families, health, education, etc.).

**Authority control mechanisms. Th e constitutional and legal system provides for solutions**
aimed at ensuring the control over activities of the public authorities as well as providing these
authorities with necessary tools to carry out the control tasks. Regulations in force allow to determine,
also in issues relating to national security, the correspondence between the existing situation and the
projected or admissible one, establish, the reasons for discrepancies, formulate of conclusions (for an
institution being controlled and for other state authorities), as well as improve management support
mechanisms.

Th e said solutions comprise internal and external control mechanisms within the administrative structures, mechanisms of control imposed by state institutions (including the Supreme Audit
Offi ce), as well as prosecutorial and judicial control. Political control exercised by legislative entities
(using such tools as interpellations, enquiries, desiderata, votes of approval, investigations, activities of


-----

### WHITE BOOKTON NATIONAL SECURITY OF THE REPUBLIC OF POLAND

parliamentary commissions, including of parliamentary investigation commissions) as well as directly
by citizens (e.g. through elections and access to public documents) is of particular signifi cance. Th e
media fulfi l an important control function, too. In a growing number of cases to which the provisions
of international law and interstate agreements apply, the control function is performed by external
entities (including, above all, the bodies of the European Union and of the Council of Europe).

-  * *

Th e political system and legal conditions stipulated in the Constitution of the Republic of Poland provide a general framework for defi ning the catalogue of national interests and strategic objectives in the fi eld of security, as these interests and objectives should be formulated taking into account
both the functions of the state specifi ed in Article 5 of the Constitution and the system-founding rules
of the Republic of Poland.

Th e defence potential

Th e defence potential is comprised of: the foreign service (diplomacy) whose task is to ensure
security, the Armed Forces of the Republic of Poland, military secret services, and defence industry.

Th e **foreign service tasked with ensuring security functions and transforms itself in ac-**
cordance with the contemporary trends and the changing geopolitical and economic situation. Poland has embassies in 89 countries and representations with 9 international organizations. Th ere are
36 consulates general in 19 countries and, in addition, there are consular departments of the Polish
embassies. Currently, there are 23 Polish Institutes functioning abroad (as of 31 December 2012).

Th e support for foreign service tasked with ensuring security is provided by 55 defence attachés
at diplomatic missions of the Republic of Poland around the world. Th ey are an important element
within the structure of Polish embassies and play a signifi cant role in the development and coordination of international military cooperation.

Th e task of foreign policy – and of diplomacy as its tool – is to help ensure favourable international conditions, thereby guaranteeing, as much as possible, the security of the Republic of Poland
and protecting its broadly-conceived security interests. Diplomacy allows the country to express and
conduct foreign policy through, inter alia, appropriate legal bases, organization, staff, procedures, and
methods of operation.

Poland’s location as a frontier country of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization and of the
European Union places a special responsibility on diplomacy. Polish diplomacy represents the interests of a major state in central Europe, having ambitions to play a signifi cant role on the continent.
Its activities include creating a stable international security environment at regional and global level
through international cooperation, particularly within the North Atlantic Treaty Organization, the
European Union, the United Nations, the Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe and
other international organizations as well as in relations with its nearest neighbours and main partners.

Th e Permanent Representation of the Republic of Poland to NATO plays a particularly important role within the foreign service tasked with ensuring security and participates in the decision-making processes of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization on an ongoing basis. Essential tasks in the
field of security are also implemented by the Permanent Representation of the Republic of Poland to

the European Union. Th eir value is that they can seek, within the Alliance and the EU, to have Polish
national interests and strategic objectives taken into account in activities of the two organizations. It is
achieved through participation in the work and meetings of various committees and working groups.

Th e Polish Military Representation to the NATO Military Committee and the EU Military
Committee as well as the representations to the NATO strategic commands are the liaison cells between
the national and NATO military authorities. Activities of the Polish MilRep are mainly concentrated
around the issues of military security of the Euro-Atlantic area as well as military cooperation between
the allies and the partners from NATO and the EU. Th e strength of the Polish Military Representation
lies in its ability to infl uence the ongoing operation of NATO and the EU through participation in the
processes of defence planning, crisis management, command structure transformation, exchange of
information and of reconnaissance and intelligence data, as well as in their ability to develop military
and civil cooperation with international security institutions.

As the globalization process advances – leading, inter alia, to a relatively weakened role of the
state, a broader notion of security, the quickening pace of the dissemination of information and the
multitude of its resources – diplomacy will become even more signifi cant. Moreover, the functions of
diplomacy will change as well. For instance, the signifi cance of development policies in the activities of
the Polish Ministry of Foreign Aff airs will increase – as an expression of aspirations to enjoy the status
of a developed country and an instrument to stabilise crises aft er the confl ict stage is over.

Changes in the foreign service which have taken place in recent years included: the introduction of new standards for formulation and assignment of objectives; the categorization of missions
abroad; the introduction of project management; the informatization and streamlining of consular
services; the reform of the diplomatic security system; the modernization of the IT platform as well
as focusing on promotion of the image of Poland and Polish foreign policy through modern forms of
communication, mainly via the Internet.

Th ere are two common models of recruitment of diplomatic personnel functioning in the
world: the American model (where top diplomatic positions are given to activists and persons who
made signifi cant contributions to a winning party, and the executive positions – to professional diplomats with best qualifi cations) and the European model (where diplomatic positions are held only by
specialists selected in competitions from among the personnel of the department of foreign aff airs).
In Poland, there is a mixed model in place. Positions in diplomatic missions are partially assigned to
unprepared party activists, partially – through “external recruitment” – to personnel from ministries
and central offi ces, and partially to staff employees of the Ministry of Foreign Aff airs. Th e picture is
completed with military attaches and liaison offi cers of uniformed services as well as employees of the
Polish Institutes who are newcomers in the fi eld of diplomacy. From among the above categories, only
the professional diplomats, military attaches, and liaison offi cers always receive suffi cient preparation
to undertake diplomatic service.

Th e Armed Forces of the Republic of Poland remain the key instrument in implementing Polish security policy. Th eir constitutional task is to safeguard the independence and territorial integrity
of Poland, and to ensure the security and inviolability of its borders.

Th e Armed Forces of the Republic of Poland maintain readiness to perform three types of
missions: guaranteeing defence of the state and ward off aggression; participating in the process of
stabilization of the international situation and in crisis response and humanitarian operations; and
supporting the internal security and rendering assistance to the population.

For more than two decades the Polish Armed Forces have been undergoing deep systemic transformation. Th e starting point of this process was more than 400-thousand mass army based on conscription, which concentrated its eff orts on preparations for major armed confl ict within the forces of the
Warsaw Pact. Large and costly reserves were an inherent element in the system. Further maintenance of
such potential in completely diff erent geopolitical conditions not only did not fi t the defence needs, but
also substantially exceeded the economic capabilities of the state. Th e initial stage of the transformation
consisted, in fact, in a rather chaotic reduction of the personnel and of signifi cant amounts of military
equipment and armaments. Only between 1989 and 1993, the armed forces were reduced by 25 per cent.

Th e organizational and structural reforms carried out in accordance with the changing concepts,
led, ons the one hand, to certain savings, but on the other – resulted in the loss of certain capabilities (as
a consequence of withdrawing from service of large quantities of outdated equipment and armaments,
including destruction means) as well as in the technical degradation of (mainly post-Soviet) armament,
equipment and military infrastructure.

Another negative consequence of the transformations was uneven and ineff ective deployments
of military units (oft en in isolation from training ranges) as well as the unfavourable change of proportions between the combat components and the broadly understood supply base (support units,
training and education system potential, overextended command structures, etc.). All these factors
aff ected directly the level of defence capabilities.

Th e second stage of transformations as well as an attempt to organise this process began with
Polish eff orts to join the North Atlantic Alliance. Th e standardization process was launched and eff orts
were made to achieve compatibility and interoperability of the Polish Armed Forces with the forces
of other NATO members. Moreover, the number of garrisons was successively limited and, in order
to meet social expectations, the duration of conscript military service started to be gradually reduced.

An important turning point marking the beginning of the third stage of the armed forces transformations was the Act on the Restructuring, Technical

planning cycle, owing to which it was possible to reach and later exceed the level of 20 per cent of capital (modernization) expenditure under the defence budget. Substantial modernization projects were
launched as well (fi g. 8), as a result of which F-16 multi-role aircraft, CASA transport aircraft, Spike
anti-tank guided missiles, and Rosomak wheeled armoured vehicles (kołowy transporter opancerzony,
KTO) all entered into service. Th e major process of computerization and IT advancement of the army
commenced.

Th e next stage of transformation of the Polish army was marked by the adoption of the “Programme of Professionalization of the Armed Forces for the years 2008–2010” by the Council of Ministers on 5 August 2008. Th e professionalization of the armed forces was the most important transformation decision of the past two decades. As a result, the military service is completely voluntary, with
all consequences of this fact.

nical modernization of the Polish Armed Forces has accelerated. Owing to the planned purchases and
the successive entry into service of modern military equipment and armaments, certain segments of the
Polish Armed Forces have already been suffi ciently modernized, while other require further investments.

In the defence budget for 2012, the share of capital expenditure once again exceeded, as planned, the level of 20 per cent of defence spending, reaching exactly 24.4 per cent (as shown in fi g. 9).

Despite the deep transformation that the armed forces have undergone for many years, there are
still a number of shortfalls resulting from both the above-mentioned historical conditions of the process
and the lack of consistency in introducing the changes (particularly from the initial period of reforms
in early 1990s), which still signifi cantly aff ects the level and effi ciency of Poland’s defence capabilities.
As a consequence of substantial reductions of the number of posts, many valuable soldiers left the ranks
and their skills and experience are not easy to replace in the short term. Th is has led to a kind of a “generation gap” in various areas. Th e withdrawal of the bulk of Warsaw Pact-vintage armaments, as well as
the “ageing” of the equipment and armaments, in particular of the missile and artillery systems, have
greatly limited the striking capabilities, which is especially palpable in the area of air defence. In a situation when missiles have become the key carrier of the striking force, the Polish Armed Forces have
currently no anti-missile defence capabilities. Th e lack of purchases, inconsistency in the implemented
programmes (cf. the Gawron corvette) and the changing concepts undermined also the potential of the
Polish Navy.

Th e organization of the control and command system at the strategic level is hardly eff ective.
Overblown and frequently duplicated functions of the command structure do not meet the needs of
allied cooperation/collaboration or of the considerably reduced army, thereby complicating the strategic planning and ongoing implementation of tasks. Th e major weakness of the current command and


-----

### WHITE BOOKTON NATIONAL SECURITY OF THE REPUBLIC OF POLAND

control system of the armed forces lies in ineffi cient supervision of the execution of the decisions and
the lax implementation discipline. Th is results from the defective organization of the system, in which
the minister of national defence has limited possibilities to fully control the armed forces (in terms
of decision-making, implementation, and accountability). In fact, the minister is dependent on the
General Staff which, in its capacity as the staff /command entity, holds all the command functions: it is
responsible for planning the tasks (as the staff ), their implementation (as the command of the armed
forces), as well as for the assessment of execution (again as the staff ).

A number of problems emerged in the area of enlistment and reserves. Forming the National
Reserve Forces (NSR), with the target number 20 thousand soldiers, began on 1 July 2010. Th e Ministry
of National Defence initially divided this process into two stages. It was planned that 10 thousand of
the National Reserve Forces would be enlisted by the end of 2010, and the other 10 thousand – by the
end of 2011. Currently (as of the end of 2012) there are less than 10 thousand soldiers in the NSR. Th e
concept was that the NSR soldiers would fi ll in the full-time posts for specialists in defi cient specialities
as well as will staff the posts in military specialities which do not require everyday military training.

Th e military education system, despite successive reforms, remains dispersed and far too large.
Moreover, it focuses more on the needs of the civil market rather than the army, which is contrary to
the idea of professionalization of the armed forces. At present, there are three military academies: the
National Defence Academy, the Military University of Technology, and the Naval Academy, as well as
two military higher education institutions: the Polish Air Force Academy and the Military Academy of
Land Forces.

Th e health care system faces some problems, too. Th e health service is understaff ed and fi nds it
diffi cult to secure the operations of the Polish military contingents (PMCs, polskie _kontyngenty wojsko-_
_we) abroad. Both the state of the battlefi eld medical technology and the system of training and bettering_
qualifi cations of medical personnel are unsatisfactory.

DIAGNOSIS OF THE STATE OF NATIONAL SECURITY

Th e IT systems used in the army, both in the logistics and support area and the automated command systems, are oft en incompatible, which makes it diffi cult to use data eff ectively, particularly in the
real time, hampers joint operations, and complicates the decision-making processes. Th e armed forces
do not make suffi cient use of unmanned aerial vehicles as well as use the satellite technologies – which
ensure eff ective communication over long distances and an off er informational advantage – only to a limited extent. Th e potential of the country’s arms industry and research base is not exploited enough.

A positive result of the transformation of the armed forces is the fact that, since Poland’s entry
into NATO, the country has become not only the consumer of security, but also its “producer”. Th is
fi nds its confi rmation in the participation of Polish military contingents in missions abroad, which is
highly assessed by allies and partners (fi g. 10). A turning point in this regard was the PMC participation in the stabilization mission in Iraq, during which Poland took the command of the Centre-South
Multinational Division responsible for security in the central region of the country, and in the ISAF
operations in Afghanistan, where Poland was tasked with ensuring security in the Ghazni province.
Tens of thousands of soldiers and military staff have gained invaluable experience in those missions.

Experience gained so far in the course of the transformation process confi rmed that professional armed forces – fl exible, mobile, as well as adequately armed and trained – are more eff ective and
effi cient and, consequently, are of greater operational value and better guarantee the security of the
state and its citizens than a conscript army. It was therefore an important achievement of the previous
transformations of the Polish Armed Forces that, irrespective of minor shortfalls, the professionalization programme was completed. Th is process needs to be continued and appropriately adjusted
taking into account the experience of the last few years during which the Polish army functioned in
accordance with the new scheme.

Th e armed forces successfully fulfi l their tasks connected with assistance provided to the population in crisis situations, including during natural disasters (this is one of the reasons why the army
enjoys the undiminished confi dence of the public). Th e bond between the army and the population is
of particular importance in the conditions of the professional army.

In conclusion, the condition of the Polish army is systematically improving. Th e process of further transformation of the Armed Forces of the Republic of Poland, is underway, aiming at increasing
the military potential and operational capabilities. Th e modern equipment is successively provided
to the army while the ongoing organizational consolidation helps gradually improve the operational
capabilities of the Polish armed forces. Th ere are still some areas, however, which require special attention and further modernization eff ort.

**Military intelligence and counterintelligence. Th e** **_Military Intelligence Service (Służba_**
_Wywiadu Wojskowego, SWW) carries out intelligence operations for the Polish Armed Forces. It is_
a secret service tasked with ensuring protection against external threats to the state’s defence, security, and combat capabilities of the Polish Armed Forces and other organizational units reporting to
or supervised by the minister of national defence. Th e SWW was established aft er the liquidation of
the Military Information Service in 2006 and operates on the basis of the Act of 9 June 2006 on the
Military Counterintelligence Service and the Military Intelligence Service. Th e chief of the SWW is
responsible to the minister of national defence, on the stipulation of the powers of the Prime Minister
or the minister-coordinator of the secret services, in case one is appointed.

Th e aforesaid formation is a member of the international intelligence community. It participates in the exchange of information and experience among intelligence services of members of NATO

and the EU. Th e SWW carries out its tasks outside the territory of the Republic of Poland. Th e activity
of SWW within the territory of Poland can be conducted only in association with its operations
abroad. Th e statutory tasks of SWW offi cers include the preliminary reconnaissance as well as analytical and informational activities. Th ey are authorized to use fi rearms and have the powers under the act
on protection of people and property as regards offi cers and soldiers handling tasks relating to physical
protection of the SWW facilities.

Some of the key tasks systematically performed by the Military Intelligence Service include:
collection and processing of information critical for the safety of the defence potential, combat capabilities and implementation of tasks by the Polish Armed Forces; identifying and counteracting military threats against Poland’s defence capabilities as well as international terrorism threats; identifying


-----

DIAGNOSIS OF THE STATE OF NATIONAL SECURITY

threats associated with illicit international trade in arms, ammunition and explosive materials, trade
in goods, technologies and services of strategic importance for the state’s security as well as the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction; participating in planning and controlling the implementation
of international disarmament agreements; identifying and analyzing threats in regions of international
tensions, confl icts, and crises, which aff ect the national defence and operational ability of the Polish
Armed Forces, as well as taking steps to eliminate those threats; carrying out electronic intelligence
activities for the Polish Armed Forces and projects in the fi eld of cryptanalysis and cryptography.

Th e counterintelligence activities for the Armed Forces of the Republic of Poland are pursued
by the **_Military Counterintelligence Service (Służba Kontrwywiadu Wojskowego,_** SKW) – a secret
service responsible for ensuring protection against internal threats to the defence capabilities of the
state, security and combat capabilities of the Armed Forces and other organizational units responsible
to or supervised by the minister of national defence. To this aim, the SKW carries out a number of
activities associated with counteracting espionage, corruption in the area of dangers to the defence
capabilities of the state as well as threats to units, facilities and installations important from the point of
view of defence, and also ensuring cyber security of the Polish Armed Forces. Moreover, the SKW performs tasks associated with ensuring security and conducting scientifi c research, development work,
the aim of which is to enhance the military security of Poland.

**Defence industry. Th e defence industry potential (przemysłowy potencjał obronny) is made**
up of tangible and intangible assets of the Polish industry which meet the defence needs of the state,
including the needs of the Polish Armed Forces as regards armaments and military equipment (AME).
At present, the defence industry potential comprises, inter alia, the companies conducting business
activity for the needs of security and defence of the state, the majority shareholder of which is the state
treasury; enterprises founded by the minister of national defence; R&D units as well as companies
engaged in foreign trade in goods, technologies, and services of strategic importance for the state’s
security. Moreover, the importance of non-state-owned companies on the domestic defence market
is growing.

Th e system of procurement of armaments and military equipment for the Polish Armed Forces,
i.e. selection of a supplier or manufacturer of a specifi c product or service, is based on principles set
forth in the Act of 29 January 2004 – Public Procurement Law as well as relevant decisions of the
minister of national defence. Th e selection process takes the form of open tenders and every bidder
can take part in those ones. Due to the competitiveness of the European market and the consequences
of Poland’s membership in the European Union, tenders are open also to foreign suppliers.

Th e procurement of armaments and military equipment for the Polish Armed Forces is based
on specifi c future and current needs, as well as on urgent operational requirements. Future needs result
from operational requirements defi ned in long-term plans and programmes, aimed at achieving or
streamlining specifi c operational capabilities of the Polish Armed Forces. Th e current needs, in turn,
necessitate reaching specifi c operational capabilities, the aim of which is to ensure that the Armed
Forces function systematically, as intended. Th e urgent operational requirement means immediate
acquisition of AME due to the necessity of using the Polish Armed Forces, which could not have been
foreseen during the planning stage given reasonable diligence.

According to the objectives of the Strategy for Consolidation and Support of the Development
of the Polish Defence Industry, the defence industry potential is one of the basic elements of security
and defence of the state. Th e strategy of activities relating to the defence industry potential provides for


-----

### WHITE BOOKTON NATIONAL SECURITY OF THE REPUBLIC OF POLAND

the consolidation based on, inter alia, the commercialization of state enterprises and selected research
and development (R&D) units, the reorganization of the defence industry potential, and cooperation
with strategic investors.

Th e current condition of the defence industry potential is unsatisfactory. Th e defence industry
is not competitive enough to participate extensively in the process of technical modernization of the
Polish Armed Forces, as well as to eff ectively compete on foreign markets. Companies in this sector –
especially those which are directly or indirectly controlled by the State Treasury – are not suffi ciently
resistant to eff ects of fl uctuations on the defence market while they cope with a number of structural
problems. Th is results in their strong dependence on orders from the government; their insuffi ciently
attractive market off er in terms of the product range, costs, and technological advancement; their weak
position on foreign markets as well as the lack of activity in the fi eld of R&D and in obtaining funds
for this purpose.

Th e current experience with the restructuring of the sector has indicated that division of
responsibilities among a number of ministries (the Ministry of National Defence, the Ministry of
Treasury, the Ministry of Economy), which results, inter alia, from the previous ownership structure
of the DIP, excessively lengthens the decision-making process and is not conducive to the eff ectiveness
of activities related to the acquisition, manufacture and promotion of armaments and military equipment. From the perspective of technical modernization of the Polish Armed Forces, ensuring of the
state’s security should be understood as a need to develop and introduce modern armaments and
military equipment as well as to maintain the state’s own production capabilities. Guaranteeing the
safety of supplies of armaments and military equipment to the armed forces and the eff ective operation
of the equipment supplied (the warranty period, overhauls, servicing) are a constant challenge for the
state’s administration.

-  * *

Th e defence potential of the Republic of Poland is systematically growing. Th e improvement
of operational capabilities of the professional Polish Armed Forces has a positive eff ect on the level of
Polish ambitions and, therefore, on the scale and nature of national interests and strategic objectives
in the fi eld of security.

Th e protection potential

Th e protection potential comprises: the judiciary; secret services; services, guards, and inspections specializing in providing security and public order; rescue and civil safety services; elements of
crisis management; border guards and other institutions whose direct or indirect task is to safeguard
public security.

**Th e judiciary. A properly operating system of justice guarantees a stable functioning of the**
state and ensures the security of the population and citizens. Th e judicial power is one of the three elements of the systemic separation of powers. Pursuant to Article 175 of the Constitution of the Republic
of Poland, the justice in the Republic of Poland shall be administered by courts only. Th ese include: the
Supreme Court, common courts, administrative courts, and military courts. Apart from courts, the
judicial powers are also vested in two tribunals – the Constitutional Tribunal and the Tribunal of State.


-----

DIAGNOSIS OF THE STATE OF NATIONAL SECURITY

Special courts, competent for a specifi c group of cases, are outside the system of common courts. Th ey include administrative and military courts. Th e rules applicable in proceedings held before
special courts are the same as in common courts. Administrative courts control the legality of activities
of the public administration.

One of the most serious problems of the Polish judiciary is the lengthiness of court proceedings. Th is situation aff ects the certainty and stability of business activity, the freedom of which is one
of the pillars of the economic system of the Republic of Poland. In addition, the authorities conducting
proceedings frequently demand exorbitant bail bonds and unjustifi ed security on property, which may
lead to bankruptcy of companies and consequential loss of jobs even before the court verdict is issued.

Th e unsatisfactory eff ectiveness of the Polish judicial system is also associated with its insuffi cient computerization, the process of which has in fact just started and requires intensifi cation. Th e
weakness of the judiciary lies in the insuffi cient fl ow of information among various entities due to
the lack of a common electronic database. For instance, the National Court Register, in which data
on members of companies’ governing bodies are held, has no access to the criminal record base and
therefore is unable to verify whether the function of a member of management board or supervisory
board of a given company has been entrusted or not to a person with a criminal record.

Institutions of the system of justice closely cooperate with legal protection bodies, including the
public prosecutors and the Prison Service.

**_Public prosecutors. Th e role of public prosecutors is to ensure the observance of the law and to_**
combat crimes. Th ey comprise: the public prosecutor general and subordinate prosecutors of common
and military organizational units of as well as prosecutors of the Institute of National Remembrance –
Commission for the Prosecution of Crimes against the Polish Nation.

Prosecutors of common organizational units of the prosecutor’s offi ces are prosecutors of the
General Public Prosecutor’s Offi ce, appellate public prosecutor’s offi ces, regional public prosecutor’s
offi ces, and district public prosecutor’s offi ces.

Prosecutors of military organizational units of prosecutor’s offi ces are prosecutors of the Chief Military Prosecutor’s Offi ce, regional military prosecutor’s offi ces, and garrison military prosecutor’s offi ces.

In terms of substance, military prosecutors are responsible to the public prosecutor general,
whose one of the deputies is the chief military prosecutor. In terms of structure and organization,
military organizational units of the prosecutor’s offi ces are part of the Polish Armed Forces and their
activity is fi nanced from separate budgetary funds of the Ministry of National Defence. In terms of
military service, the chief military prosecutor reports to the minister of national defence.

Th e Constitution of the Republic of Poland does not contain any direct provisions stipulating
the legal model of the prosecutor’s offi ce or its position within the constitutional system of the state.
Th e organization and activity of the prosecutor’s offi ce were defi ned in the Act of 20 June 1985 on the
Prosecutor’s Offi ce, which later has been amended many a time.

Prosecutors conduct or oversee preliminary proceedings in criminal cases as well as perform
the function of a public prosecutor before courts. A detailed range of powers held by prosecutors who
participate in such cases and their obligations are regulated by the law of criminal procedure.

Military prosecutors – apart from carrying out their offi cial tasks corresponding to the obligations of prosecutors of common organizational units of the prosecution service – pursue in addition
activities directly connected with ensuring the observance of law and maintaining an appropriate level
of military discipline both in military units and institutions and in military contingents abroad.

### WHITE BOOKTON NATIONAL SECURITY OF THE REPUBLIC OF POLAND

In 2010, the functions of the public prosecutor general and of the minister of justice were
separated.

Th e Prison Service (Służba Więzienna) pursues penitentiary, protection, and social rehabilitation activities towards persons sentenced to imprisonment. It is also responsible for temporary detainment in a manner ensuring the proper conduct of criminal proceedings. Th e basic tasks of the Prison
Service include: protecting the public against the negative impact of off enders identifi ed by the system
of justice; fending off threats by deterring potential perpetrators of off ences; isolating sentenced persons from the rest of the society with respect for human dignity and humanitarian principles, as well
as social rehabilitation of off enders.

Th e Prison Service consists of the following organizational units: the Central Board of Prison
Service, regional inspectorates of the Prison Service, correctional facilities, and remand centres as well
as of in-service training centres for personnel. Nearly 27 thousand offi cers serve in the Prison Service.
In addition, there are approximately 3 thousand civilian employees in the sector.

Th e biggest challenge for the Polish penitentiary system in recent years was overcrowding of
correctional facilities and remand centres. Such a situation was a result of the increase in crime, especially in 1990s and at the turn of the century. Overcrowding in Polish prisons was the subject matter of
decisions of the European Court of Human Rights and the Polish Tribunal of State.

Prison overcrowding is still a problem in certain units but, in general, the situation has lately
improved. In November 2012, the population in penitentiary units did not exceed their normative
capacity and reached 96.7 per cent. Penitentiary facilities held 85.2 thousand convicts, while nearly 47
thousand persons waited to serve their prison terms (as of March 2012).

DIAGNOSIS OF THE STATE OF NATIONAL SECURITY

Another problem that the Prison Service faces is the chronic lack of adequate funding. Th e
assets owned by the Prison Service are constantly declining. Th ree-quarters of the 160 penitentiary
units were erected before World War II. Th e aged infrastructure, especially taking into consideration
the large numbers of convicts, may have a negative eff ect on effi cient performance of the isolating
function or social rehabilitation.
In order to improve the functioning of the Polish prison system, a new act on Prison Service
was adopted on 9 April 2010, which established the Penitentiary Policy Council – an advisory body to
the minister of justice. Th e act tidied up a number of issues relating to the employment of the Prison
Service offi cers. It is assumed that certain problems connected with overcrowding will be solved by the
electronic probation system.
**Secret services. Th ere is no defi nition of secret services in Polish law. Although Article 11 of the**
Act on Internal Security Agency and the Intelligence Agency refers to the Internal Security Agency (Agenc_ja Bezpieczeństwa Wewnętrznego, ABW), the Foreign Intelligence Agency (Agencja Wywiadu, AW), the_
Central Anti-Corruption Bureau (Centralne Biuro Antykorupcyjne, CBA), the Military Counterintelligence
Service and the Military Intelligence Service as special services, it does so only for the purposes of the act.
Taking into consideration the fact, that the above services are not the only ones that shoulder the preliminary investigative responsibilities, it is diffi cult to state without doubt which of them should be considered
secret services and what the classifi cation criteria are. Above all, there is no single act which would defi ne
and classify the preliminary investigation activities and stipulate, for all services, who, when, and in what
circumstances as well as upon whose authority can carry out these tasks.
Th e main entities who carry out special protection tasks include: the Internal Security Agency,
the Intelligence Agency, the Central Anti-Corruption Bureau as well as – already discussed in the
section devoted to the defence potential – the Military Counterintelligence Service and the Military
Intelligence Service (fi g. 11).

Agency

Th e Internal Security Agency is a secret service responsible for safeguarding the internal security of the state and its constitutional order. Its tasks include surveillance, heading off and combating threats against the state’s internal security, its constitutional order, and specifi cally its sovereignty
and international position, independence and territorial integrity, as well as national defence. As the
national security authority, the ABW implements, within its competence, the tasks relating to protection of classifi ed information. An important element of the Agency’s operation is its analytical and
informational activity, which involves collecting information that is potentially signifi cant from the
point of view of internal security of the state as well as analysing of this information and its provision to
competent authorities. Th e Head of the Internal Security Agency, who leads the Agency’s operations,
is a central organ of the government administration. Th e organ reports directly to the Prime Minister
and its activity is controlled by the Sejm.

Th e **_Foreign Intelligence Agency is responsible for safeguarding the external security of the_**
state and, in principle, carries out its operations outside the territory of the Republic of Poland. Th e
basic tasks of the AW include: collecting information which is potentially signifi cant from the point of
view of security and international position of Poland and its economic and defence potential as well as
the analysis of this information and its provision to competent authorities; identifying and combating
external threats to the state’s security – including international terrorism, extremism, international
organized crime groups; operations of foreign secret services and other activities which can be detrimental to the interests of the Republic of Poland. Th e Agency ensures cryptographic protection of
communication with Polish diplomatic and consular missions. Another critical challenge facing the
Agency in the age of globalization and the development of cyberspace is electronic intelligence. Th e
Foreign Intelligence Agency is managed by the Head of the Foreign Intelligence Agency who reports
directly to the Prime Minister and whose activity is controlled by the Sejm.

**_Th e Central Anti-Corruption Bureau is a secret service established to combat corruption in_**
public life and economy, particularly in public and local government institutions, as well as to combat
activities detrimental to the State’s economic interests. Th e CBA is managed by its Head, who is supervised by the Prime Minister. Th e activities of the head of the CBA are controlled by the Sejm.

Th e Bureau, apart from operational issues and preparatory proceedings, exercises control, analytical, informational, and preventative activities, including the educational tasks.

DIAGNOSIS OF THE STATE OF NATIONAL SECURITY

Corruption is one of off ences against the interests of the state and its citizens, which are particularly
diffi cult to detect and prove. Poland is considered a country in which corruption – understood as using one’s
position or infl uence for personal gain – is quite common. According to global data from 2012 collected by
Transparency International, Poland ranked 41[st] (out of 176 countries surveyed) and scored 58 points (on the
scale of 0-100, where 0 means the highest index of corruption in the public sector) – table 1.

Corruption is not just a problem of criminal behaviour, but also of the quality and transparency
of public life, education, and control of the state’s socio-economic mechanisms.

Th e services performing tasks the aim of which is to ensure Poland’s security also include
treasury control authorities that are subordinate to the minister of fi nance (General Inspector of
Treasury Control, heads of treasury control offi ces) and have certain investigative powers in the fi eld
of treasury intelligence.

Th e assessment of functioning of the secret services is diffi cult due to the imprecise separation
(and overlapping) of responsibilities among civil services as well as between civil and military services.

### WHITE BOOKTON NATIONAL SECURITY OF THE REPUBLIC OF POLAND

Th e existence of many agencies tasked with safeguarding the state’s security and its constitutional order,
with overlapping responsibilities and subject to various system structures and having investigative and
surveillance powers, questions the practicality of the present solution.

Another problem – apart from the overlapping scope of tangible properties – is an inconsistent
defi nition of powers held by the services (e.g. the ABW is entitled to the so-called passive provocation,
and the CBA and the Police – are also authorized to active provocation, while the SKW has limited
powers in this fi eld). Moreover, the overly extensive use of the secret services by the prosecutors in the
course of their investigations and proceedings raises many doubts.

**Safety and public order. Th e aim of the subsystem of safety and public order is prevention and**
prosecution of perpetrators of attacks on life, health, and property of Polish citizens and other persons
staying within the territory of the Republic of Poland as well as against the state’s interests. Th e said
subsystem consists of public authorities, services, guards, and inspections specializing in safeguarding
security and public order. It is also a sector in which – apart from the medical rescue subsystem –
certain tasks, which were previously fulfi lled by the state, are now partially privatized.

Th e tasks of the public authorities in the fi eld of safety and public order are set forth in relevant
acts, inter alia, those regarding secret services, the Police, the Border Guard, the Customs Service, and
the Government Protection Bureau.

In recent years, the number of disturbances of safety and public order has been decreasing, but
it still remains a problem, especially during mass events.[1] It is important to note, however, that mass

1 In recent years, the number of mass-scale events during which the police guarded security has dropped from nearly 11
thousand in 2008 to approximately 8 thousand in 2011 and 3699 in the fi rst half of 2012. At the same time, the numbers of
off ences and misdemeanours connected with these events have increased (in 2010, 701 off ences and 1690 misdemeanours were
committed; in 2011 – 901 off ences and 6791 misdemeanours, and in the fi rst half of 2012 – as many as 735 off ences and 3905
misdemeanours were recorded). Th e vast majority of these is related to football matches (1065 misdemeanours and 530 off ences
in 2010, or 2209 misdemeanours and 574 off ences in the fi rst half of 2012).

-scale violations of the law in the context of public gatherings, social protests, strikes and blockades
have been slightly on the rise.

A negative phenomenon in Poland is that organizers of mass-scale events, in particular those who
organise political or public events, oft en lack basic knowledge about their duties relating to ensuring security, binding procedures, and associated consequences. On the other hand, the services who, under the
law, are responsible for ensuring security and public order during such events are frequently the subject
of public accusations. Such a situation has a negative infl uence on decisions regarding the engagement of
the said services, in consequence of which the measures are taken under conditions of legal uncertainty.

**_Th e_** **_Police, as a uniformed and armed formation, are tasked with protecting citizens, and en-_**
suring security and public order. Th e main responsibilities of the Police include: protecting human life
and health as well as protecting property against violent attacks which might cause damage to these
assets; protecting security and public order; initiating and organizing activities aimed at staving off
off ences and misdemeanours. Th e Police’s organizational structure is made of offi cers working in the
following services: criminal service, prevention service, as well as the service providing support for the
Police activities in the areas of organization, logistics, and technology. Th e Police also consist of the
court police, prevention units and anti-terrorist subunits.

Police training facilities include the Police Academy in Szczytno, the Police Training Centre
in Legionowo, the Police Academy in Piła, the Police School in Słupsk, the Police School in Katowice,
and research institutes. Th e Police are one of the largest formations among all uniformed services. As
of 1 November 2012, 95 997 offi cers served in its ranks, along with 24 792 civilian employees. All Police offi cers ultimately report to the Police Commander in Chief (the structure of the General Police
Headquarters is shown in fi g. 12), who in turn reports to the minister for the interior.

It is essential to properly utilise the forces and resources at the Police’s disposal – make sure
not to disperse them, but to concentrate them on tasks that are deemed priorities. Th e Police’s potential should be adjusted to real or most probable threats.

Th e **Government Protection Bureau (Biuro Ochrony Rządu, BOR), a uniform, uniformed**
and armed formation functioning within the ministry of the interior, is tasked with protection of the
highest authorities and public administration bodies. Responsibilities of the BOR include protecting
the President of the Republic of Poland, the Marshal (Speaker) of the Sejm, the Marshal of the Senate, the Prime Minister, the Deputy Prime Minister, the minister of the interior, and the minister of
foreign aff airs, as well as: other persons important for the state’s security; former presidents, offi cial
foreign delegations during their visits to Poland; Polish diplomatic representations; consular offi ces
and representations to international organizations. It is also responsible for ensuring security of facilities and installations of special importance.

A number of problems faced by the BOR result from inadequate budgetary funding for the
scale of activities as well as the multi-stage decision-making path in the course of carrying out the
tasks.

**_Cyber-crime prevention. Th e development of the so-called information society as well as new_**

riod of time, and their actions also cause substantial intangible damage. Th e Polish procedures
and regulations pertaining to the exchange of information on practices and tactics employed by
such off enders are not perfect. Consequently, it is diffi cult to develop uniform methods aimed
at detection, monitoring and prevention of such off ences in cyberspace and, therefore, to adequately prepare the law enforcement agencies. Due to the fact that information technologies
quickly become obsolete, that means earmarked on ensuring proper security of IT and data
communication systems are constantly growing.

At present, the protection of cyberspace is one of the key strategic tasks in the fi eld of security
in practically every country. With the rapid development of technology observed in recent years, in
particular of telecommunication technologies, as well as a very rapid computerization of virtually every
sphere of life, information becomes the most valuable asset. It is a key to success not only in politics
and business, but also in planning and carrying out military operations. What is also important is the
fact that the proper fl ow and availability of information is a condition for ensuring effi cient economy,
administration, and specialist services in any state.

In order to meet challenges connected with the development and wide application of data communication networks, a Ministry of Administration and Digitization (Ministerstwo Administracji i Cy_fryzacji, MAC) was established on 21 November 2011. Th e new ministry assumed full responsibility_
for the computerization and communication areas. It is responsible for the computerization of public
administration and its data communication networks, information techniques and technologies, IT
standards, the support for IT investments, the application of IT technologies in information society;
the development of information society, a well as the fulfi lment of Poland’s international commitments
concerning computerization, mail, and data telecommunication.

It must be stressed that modern data communication systems and in particular the systems
which are part of the so-called critical infrastructure and are of key importance for the state’s security
should be most reliable. Th ese systems must also ensure a high level of integrity and confi dentiality of
information processed and sent through them. Th is is all the more important as systems and information they store are liable to become a target of attacks by e.g. foreign secret services or even private
users, as evidenced by WikiLeaks and hacker attacks in response to Poland’s signing of the international
ACTA agreement.

Th e responsibility for appropriate response in the case of attacks on data communication systems lies with the Governmental Computer Security Incident Response Team CERT.GOV.PL, which
functions within the ABW.

Technically, the creation of an absolutely secure data communication system is practically impossible. Th e eff ectiveness of even best designed and most costly security systems depends mostly on
their users as well as on their awareness, training, and knowledge of the regulations.

Another serious problem faced by institutions tasked with ensuring data communication security are diffi culties in fi nding specialists, in particular IT engineers knowledgeable about data communication security issues. Th ey belong to a group of professionals who are very much in demand. What
negatively impacts the security of telecommunication systems is also the lack of suffi cient skills and
awareness of threats to the information processed, both at the level of users and of administrators or
organisers of data communication systems.

Yet another problem may arise from the dispersion of responsibility for data communication
safety and improper fl ow of information between entities obliged to tackle with problems. Lack of

Th e solutions adopted in these acts translate into the system of functioning of the authorities

scale of the phenomenon of terrorism pose a serious
challenge for the majority of international and national authorities. National and international
authorities responsible for the analysis and exchange of information on terrorist threats are still being
shaped both in terms of responsibilities and the manners of operation. Th is concerns the strategic and
operational levels in particular.

Poland has at its disposal the necessary forces and resources (services and institutions) to combat terrorism; nonetheless these forces and resources are scattered. Th e imprecise defi nition of obligations and responsibilities of specifi c entities within the security system that are responsible for
combating terrorism as well as the insuffi cient coordination of activities are a major impediment to
cooperation and collaboration at national and international level. An example of this situation is the
National Crisis Management Plan (adopted by the Council of Ministers on 6 March 2012). In accordance with this document, there are four stages of activities performed by services in the fi eld of crisis
management – including a crisis arising from a terrorist threat: prevention, preparation, response, and
recovery. Th e responsibility for each type of these activities lies with diff erent services (fi g. 14).

**Rescue and civil protection services. Th e State Fire Service (Państwowa Straż Pożarna, PSP),**
a professional formation set up to fi ght fi res, natural disasters and other local threats, plays the leading
role among rescue and civil protection services. Within the rescue and civil protection subsystem,
the PSP is supported by other services, guards, and state institutions as well as a network of non-governmental organizations. Th e PSP’s scope of duties has been signifi cantly expanded since its establishment. It is no longer limited to fi ghting fi res, as it used to be in the beginning, but covers also the
organization and execution of rescue mission in crisis situations, including disasters and traffi c, construction, or chemical accidents. Moreover, the formation oversees compliance with fi re regulations,
carries out the scientifi c and research work in the fi eld of fi re protection and civil protection, as well
as cooperates with the head of the National Criminal Information Centre. Nearly 30 thousand offi cers
serve in the State Fire Service. Th e head of the formation is the Chief Commandant of the National Fire
Service, who is subordinate to the minister of the interior.

In practice, the PSP oft en coordinates rescue operations at the site of a disaster, including the
work of policemen and ambulance service. In recent years, the fi re service underwent technical modernization. Both its vehicles and rescue and fi re-fi ghting equipment have been systematically replaced with new ones. Moreover, the PSP procedures have been revized and adjusted to meet new challenges. Th e PSP works particularly closely with the voluntary fi re service (Ochotnicza Straż Pożarna,
OSP), which counts nearly 17 thousand units with ca. 500 thousand active volunteer fi re fi ghters (of
which 3815 voluntary fi re fi ghting units with 126 thousand fi re-fi ghters are a part of the National Fire
Fighting and Rescue System (Krajowy System Ratowniczo-Gaśniczy, KSRG)).

Th e responsibility for building the National Fire Fighting and Rescue System lies with the Chief
Commandant. Th e objective of this task was to create an integrated system which would bring together various interrelated rescue units and enable carrying out operations in the fi eld of rescue and civil protection.
At present, the KSRG is an integral part of the state’s internal security system and covers operations aimed
at protecting life, health, property, or environment against fi res, natural disasters and other local dangers.

DIAGNOSIS OF THE STATE OF NATIONAL SECURITY

It should be pointed out in this context that insuffi cient cooperation of the rescue and civil
protection services with the population poses a problem. On the one hand, it concerns the evolution
of methods applied previously to inform the population about dangers. On the other hand, however,
certain shortcomings associated with the establishing of emergency call centres need to be addressed.
Th e centres do not serve the population of the entire country in a proper and uniform manner, and
people calling 112 do not always receive adequate assistance. Nonetheless, the previous emergency
telephone numbers are still valid and active.

An important element of operations in the fi eld of rescue and civil protection is the functioning
of the civil protection system in time of war (civil defence).

Under the current state of the law, the Chief of the National Civil Defence, as the central government administration authority for civil defence matters, is responsible for the implementation of
tasks involving the preparation of draft objectives and principles of civil defence operations, determination of general rules of performing civil defence tasks, as well as coordination of specifi c projects and
control over the performance of civil defence tasks by government administration and local government authorities. According to the law, the Chief of the National Civil Defence may issue dispositions,
guidelines, instructions and regulations on matters within his competence.

Other challenges in the context of effi ciency of civil defence include the lack of defi nition of tasks in this fi eld (which is required by a ratifi ed international convention[3]) as well as the issue of release
of the OSP members (this issue is referred to in the Council of Ministers regulation of 21 September
2004 on releasing from the obligation to do active military duty in case of mobilization or during war
– Journal of Laws of 2004 No. 210, item 2136) from the obligation to do military duty in the event of
resuming of conscription under imminent threat to the state’s security (or militarization of the entire
KSRG).

**Elements of the crisis management system. Th e issue of crisis management deserves special**
attention when discussing the national security potential. In the Polish model, a crisis situation refers
only to non-military threats, although crisis management takes place both in emergency and in wartime.

In Poland, the responsibility for crisis management at the central level lies with the Council of
Ministers, which is supported in this task by the Government Crisis Management Team (its composition is shown in fi g. 15). In accordance with the law, in special situations, the said tasks can be carried
out by the minister competent for the interior, although replacing this position with the minister for
public administration should be considered.

At the province level, crisis management is in the hands of province governors, who use the
province crisis management teams and centres. At the local government level, crisis management is
the responsibility of: in districts – of district governors; in communes – of heads of communes, town
mayors and presidents. Again, support in this fi eld is provided by relevant crisis management teams
and centres.

Armed Confl icts (Protocol I), drawn up in Geneva on 8 June 1977 (Journal of Laws of 1992 No. 41, item 175) and adopted by
the Republic of Poland on 19 September 1991.

**Border services. Aft er Poland’s entry to the EU and the Schengen area, the Polish subsystem**
of state border protection was revised, thereby becoming an element of the joint European strategy
for EU protection of external borders and migration control. Consequently, the subsystem aff ects the
security of the Republic of Poland as well as of the other EU member states in the fi elds of freedom,
security, and justice. Th e lack of control of the internal EU/Schengen border means that it is necessary
to enhance controls on the Union’s external border as well as to intensify actions taken within the
country, inter alia, through closer cooperation, exchange of information, and collaboration between
services in Poland and in other EU member states (fi g. 16).

Th e state border protection model adopted in Poland is the result of external and internal environment and international commitments. Th e responsibility for protection of the state’s land and sea
borders as well as for border traffi c control lies with the minister competent for the interior, who performs these tasks with the assistance of the Chief Commander of the Border Guard. Th e protection of
the air space borders is the responsibility of the minister of national defence.

Th e Border Guard (Straż Graniczna, SG), a uniform, uniformed and armed formation, plays
the leading role in the state border protection subsystem. It is a specialized administrative unit subordinate to the Ministry of the Interior, with 15 thousand offi cers and 4 thousand civilian employees.
Th e SG performs tasks associated with the protection of state borders and control of border traffi c.
Moreover, it is responsible for issuing of permits for crossing of the state border, including visas, as
well as for preventing of transport of dangerous substances without a required permit. Th e Border
Guard’s responsibilities also include the identifi cation, prevention and detection of off ences and

misdemeanours concerning illegal crossing of state borders, as well as the control of legality of doing
work and conducting business activity by foreigners or of allowing foreigners to have work.

Apart from its standard equipment the Border Guard has at its disposal the following equipment:
aircraft for patrolling of land and sea areas, vessels, as well as land and mobile infrared and night-vision
observation systems.

**_Customs Service. Th e other component in the broadly understood subsystem of state border_**
protection is the Customs Service, which is subordinate to the minister of fi nance. Th e Customs Service is a uniform and uniformed formation tasked with ensuring protection and security of the EU
customs territory, including compliance with the law on import and export of goods. In addition, it
performs duties specifi ed in separate regulations, in particular on excise tax and gambling tax. Th e
Customs Service is also involved in fi ghting the smuggling and illegal production of cigarettes and
tobacco products, gambling, infringement of intellectual property, and cyber crime. Th ere are nearly
15 thousand offi cers employed in the Customs Service.

Th e comparison of duties and powers reveals that certain tasks of individual institutions overlap. For instance, the Border Guard and the Customs Service have duplicative powers as regards fi ghting fi scal off ences and misdemeanours as well as preventing movement of excise goods, dangerous
substances, radioactive materials, weapons, etc. across the state borders.

Th e transfer of responsibility for the state border protection in the event of armed aggression
against the Republic of Poland is another issue that needs to be regulated. Today, there are no legal
regulations which would determine the point at which the state borders cease to be protected by the
Border Guard and its role is taken over by the Polish Armed Forces. Th e manner in which the responsibility for the state border protection would be transferred to the Armed Forces is not regulated either.

DIAGNOSIS OF THE STATE OF NATIONAL SECURITY

Poland’s accession to the European Union and the integration of the legal framework for foreigners led to the establishing of the Offi ce for Foreigners (Urząd do Spraw Cudzoziemców), which replaced the previous Offi ce for Repatriation and Foreigners. Th e Head of the Offi ce for Foreigners is the
central authority of governmental administration competent with respect to entry of foreigners in the
territory of the Republic of Poland, their transit through the territory, residence in the territory, and
leaving of the territory, as well as granting to foreigners the refugee status, asylum, permit for tolerated
stay, and temporary protection (excluding matters reserved for other authorities). Th e activities of the
Head of the Offi ce for Foreigners are supervised by the minister of the interior.

Important actors in the Polish immigration policy – especially in terms of collaboration in
controlling the legality of stay and employment – are province governors. Th ey conduct various proceedings relating to foreigners, concerning, inter alia, the issues of residence, i.e. issuing of decisions
on granting (or cancelling) a permit to stay for a defi nite period of time (temporary residence up to
2 years), a permit to settle (unlimited residence), a permit to stay as a long-term resident of the EU
(unlimited residence), extending, upon a foreigner’s application, of a national visa and Schengen visa
in urgent and exceptional circumstances, such as for humanitarian reasons.

**Subsystem of secret information protection. Th e Act on Protection of Secret Information**
adopted on 5 August 2010 (which repealed the previous act of 1999) led to the creation of a uniform,
comprehensive, and eff ective system of protection of information both at national and international
level. What is important, the act has ensured both the simplicity and fl exibility of functioning of the
entire classifi ed information security system.

At present, the protection specifi ed by the provisions of the act covers only such information, the
disclosure of which would be detrimental to the interests of the Polish state. Th e remaining information resources, which are also important from the point of view of the state’s interests and concern such
spheres as economy, social and economic relations, and security of citizens, are regulated by other acts.

Th e protection of personal data of Polish citizens is ensured by the Act on Personal Data Protection
of 29 August 1997. Th e act is implemented by authorized bodies, institutions, organizational units, entities
or persons who take decisions on the purposes of processing information and the means used to this end.
Th e implementation of the act is overseen by the Inspector General for the Protection of Personal Data.

Th e state’s information security becomes a new area of the comprehensive national security
system. It introduces the standards regarding data and information protection as well as on the selection of measures and technical parameters for processing of information and data depending on the
required level of confi dentiality. Th is also concerns the security of information processed in the strategic sectors, such as industry, banking, telecommunications, energy industry, and health care.

**Other protection subsystems. In Poland, there numerous institutions directly or indirectly**
tasked with protecting public security. Regrettably, these institutions do not form a fully structured
system. Th ree types of these institutions, however, can be identifi ed, depending on their hierarchical
position, organizational structure and scope of tasks, namely: central institutions, local government
**_institutions, and private institutions._**

Th e central institutions include, inter alia, the following ones :

-  Th e Road Transport Inspection (Inspekcja Transportu Drogowego). It has been established to control the compliance with regulations on road transport and on the transport of passengers and
goods; its activities are aimed at eliminating any negative phenomena in road transport;


-----

### WHITE BOOKTON NATIONAL SECURITY OF THE REPUBLIC OF POLAND

-  Th e State Sanitary and Epidemiological Inspection (Państwowa Inspekcja Sanitarno-Epidemiolo_giczna), the Veterinary Inspection (Inspekcja Weterynaryjna), and the Agricultural and Food Qu-_
ality Inspection (Inspekcja Jakości Handlowej Artykułów Rolno-Spożywczych) perform tasks in the
fi eld of civil protection. Th ey are supervised by ministers competent for health or agriculture. In
addition, the fi rst two of them implement tasks for the subsystem of state border protection;

-  Th e Offi ce of Competition and Consumer Protection (Urząd Ochrony Konkurencji i Konsumen_tów) and its subordinate State Trade Inspection (Państwowa Inspekcja Handlowa) pursue activities_
aimed at improving the well-being of consumers by creating adequate conditions for competition
and its protection;

-  Th e General Inspector of Building Control (Główny Inspektor Nadzoru Budowlanego) carries out
activities in the fi eld of construction safety, including: fi re safety, evacuation routes, and users’ safety. Th ese activities overlap to a certain extent with tasks implemented by other security institutions
(e.g. PSP), sometimes at the expense of operational activities;

-  meteorological and hydrological services, tasked with warning about potential natural disasters;

-  control services at the disposal of specifi c ministries and province governors, as well as security
services established at certain research or production facilities which are key for national security;

-  Th e Railroad Guard (Straż Ochrony Kolei) – a uniformed, equipped with direct coercion means and
partially armed protection formation at the disposal of the Polish State Railways (PKP, Polskie Koleje
_Państwowe), a commercialized company owned by the State Treasury. Similar tasks are performed_
by company guards in certain production enterprises.

Public security institutions, subordinate to or supervised by local government, include municipal (city) guards and voluntary fi re brigades.

Municipal (city) guards are a uniformed formation, equipped with means of direct coercion, and
serve as a tool of commune governments in maintaining public order. Municipal guards are optionally
established by the commune decision-making bodies. Th e commune councils decide, inter alia, about
the organization status of the guards, their structure, and number of posts. Th e decision to establish or
dissolve the guards requires consultation with the Police and notifying the province governor.

Responsibilities of the municipal guards include in particular: preserving peace and order
in public places, controlling road traffi c, co-operating with entities responsible for saving life and
health of citizens, helping to remove technical breakdowns and consequences of natural disasters
and other local threats. Relevant legal standards impose on the municipal guards and on the Police
the obligation to cooperate and coordinate activities in the area of local security and in particular
regarding preventative actions. Th is involves, inter alia, the exchange of information, joint control,
and joint trainings.

Municipal guards are equipped with means of direct coercion, including handcuff s, batons,
pepper spray, and electroshock weapons. In order to restore order, the guards may apply these means
as well as other technical means, impose fi nes, and detain persons who disturb order to hand them
over to the Police. In cases of misdemeanours, they have also the trial rights.

Voluntary fi re brigades within the rescue and fi re fi ghting system traditionally carry out fi re
fi ghting and prevention activities. Th eir functions, however, have evolved in recent years. Th e brigades
have become more commonly involved in other types of rescue operations, including primarily technical or road incidents, where various rescue methods and measures are applied. Quite oft en voluntary
fi re fi ghters are the fi rst to appear at the site of an accident and take measures to save people’s life,


-----

health, and property. Voluntary fi re brigades also play an important role by participating in educational and charity events of local communities.

**_Private protection institutions are commercial entities which ensure security of individuals and_**
property (Specialized Armed Security Formations (specjalistyczne uzbrojone formacje ochrony, SUFO);
Internal Security Service (Wewnętrzna Służba Ochrony, WSO) security companies protecting people
and property). Th e development of the private sector of people and property protection services in
Poland dates back to the early 1990s. Th e fi rst permits for conducting this type of business activity
were issued on the basis of regulations on business activity. In 1998, however, the Act on Protection of
People and Property was introduced into the Polish legal system, which comprehensively regulated the
activities of private security institutions.

Th e private security sector in Poland off ers a wide range of services: physical protection of
facilities and sites; escorting money and valuable assets; personal, physical protection of people, as
well as protection during sports and artistic events. Th e protection of people and property is provided
also in the form of technical protection. It is estimated that in Poland there are approximately 110-150
thousand security offi cers.

-  * *

Th e protection potential is now confronted with a number of diffi cult challenges, which result
from the high crime rate (although slightly declining), including organized crime, the threat of terrorism, including cyberterrorism, as well as a higher rate of illegal immigration. In addition, there
are certain shortcomings in the rescue system, as the coordination of activities of central and local
administration is insuffi cient. Another noticeable problem is the lack of funds for preventive activities
and weaknesses of the warning system. Moreover, the excessive number of services and dispersed
supervision complicate the coordination and weaken the eff ectiveness of the protective potential.
Th ese weaknesses substantially limit the possible level of ambitions in defi ning national interests and
strategic objectives in the fi eld of security.

Th e societal security potential

Th e societal potential of security is conditioned by national identity and cultural heritage. It is
also predicated on social safety, the demographic potential, as well as the intellectual, scientifi c, and
technological potential. Important factors in the development of the societal security potential include
education, training, R&D in the fi eld of security, health service, or media.

**National identity and cultural heritage. Every nation develops and cultivates values and the**
memory of its history, which distinguish it from other nations and constitute a foundation of a belief in
its distinctiveness, on the one hand, and of the sense of belonging to a given community which shares
the same historical awareness and experience, on the other hand. Th is is called national identity and its
determinants are national heritage (national culture) and the belief in the necessity of its commemoration and of passing it on to future generations.

Th e national identity of the Polish nation has been shaped over centuries on the basis of such
elements as: language, historical tradition, religion, customs, literature, culture, art, and national symbols, including in particular the coat of arms, national colours, and the national anthem. Depending


-----

on the times and the social and political situation, this was an open phenomenon, to a lesser or greater
extent susceptible to external cultural infl uences and substantially aff ected by cultural patterns from
Western Europe (and, to a certain extent, from the East), including the common tradition of philosophy, culture, science and law. Th is is also from where the main philosophical trends, art styles,
upbringing and education models, or even economic models and legal and political systems were received and adapted. At the same time the process was oft en accompanied by the cultivation of cultural
distinctiveness and national identity. Th is was particularly evident in the times of enslavement, wars,
and partitions.

Th e historical tradition connected with struggles for independence, including the commemoration of the glory of the Polish Army (e.g. the 1410 battle of Grunwald, the Napoleonic Wars and
insurrections) as well as the care for the sites of national remembrance, in particular of military and insurgents’ cemeteries, have also played an important role in the development of Poles’ national identity.

**Social safety. Social safety is one of the fundamental values and citizen’s rights. Measures taken**
by the state to eliminate or reduce the uncertainties and threats associated with a life situation are an
important tool used to maintain the social order. Th e state’s policy includes its commitments to citizens who are in diffi cult or exceptional situations, guaranteeing aid and securing minimum benefi ts.

Th e changes which took place in Poland aft er 1989 led to a deep stratifi cation of the society. Th e
number of people with the lowest income grew dramatically, as did the number of persons permanently unemployed. One of the consequences of this fact was the expansion of the group of people suff ering
from poverty. In the long-term perspective, these persons having low income, no job, housing, access
to culture, health care, and not rarely, to education, have their chances for changing their situation
wrecked and get marginalized. Th is situation brings serious social consequences, such as higher crime
rates or pathological phenomena e.g. drug abuse, alcoholism and prostitution. It should be noted that
the process of poverty alleviation is extremely diffi cult, and children born and brought up in such an
environment usually remain in there.

As a result of the current fi nancial crisis, the number of people who cannot cope with the diffi cult economic situation has grown additionally. Th is phenomenon is associated not only with events
on fi nancial markets, but also with the insuffi cient engagement of the state in providing social support
for those most in need. Higher unemployment and the increasing number of people who are poor,
excluded or at risk of social exclusion automatically result in growing expectations towards the state.
Th e situation also gives rise to extreme views and positions as well as leads to greater susceptibility of
the crisis-stricken population to populist propaganda. Th is may stir social unrest and weaken internal
security of the state.

Recent years have also witnessed a change in the family structure, which is refl ected in the decreasing number of marriages, the growing divorce rate, and the declining birth rate. In this context,
young people who face decisions about starting a family and having children require special assistance
from the state. At present, there are an insuffi cient number of nurseries and kindergartens, and prospects in the labour market aft er having a child are unsatisfactory. Th e deteriorating value of family may
lead to weakening of interpersonal bonds and, as a further consequence, of social bonds.

**Demographic potential. Demography is a component of national security, which determines**
Poland’s position in the European balance of power. In recent years the European countries, including
Poland, have witnessed adverse demographic changes.


-----

DIAGNOSIS OF THE STATE OF NATIONAL SECURITY

At the end of 2011, Poland’s population was 38 million 482 thousand, which ranked Poland in
the 8[th] place in Europe and the 6[th] place in the European Union. It was the second year since 1997, in
which the population growth was recorded. Despite the natural increase in the number of population,
the birth rate remains low – it was 1.3 in 2011. Th is causes a number of social and economic problems:
further deformation of the age structure of the population and acceleration of depopulation processes
as well as the ageing of society (fi g. 17).

Th e number of births is not suffi cient to stop the ageing of society (fi g. 18). In 2008, the number
of elderly people, aged over 65, grew again[4]. In 2011, these persons accounted for 13.8 per cent of the
entire population, i.e. 5.3 million. Th e eldest group (aged over 80) accounts for 3.6 per cent of population.

**Societal capital. Th e essential components of the societal security capital include: the shape of**
the social and demographic structure, existing inequalities and social confl icts, and the activity of civil
society. Another important factor is the population’s awareness of national security issues.

Th e societal capital refers to the potential accumulated in the society in the form of standards
of conduct, trust, and commitment. An active society, possessing high qualifi cations and competences,
adequately prepared for contemporary security threats and challenges, is a condition sine qua non for
ensuring the social and economic development, including the development of the civil society and
further improvement of the quality of life and security of citizens.

Assessing the standards of conduct is an extremely complex process. Th e key factors which
determine the development potential of Poles and of Poland include: cooperation, independent thinking, subjectivity and integrity. Other factors are: trust and entrepreneurship, and lastly, leadership
and energy. Th e level of trust is additionally correlated with the competitiveness of the economy.

**National security in the public opinion[5]. Nearly three-quarters of respondents (72 per cent)**
consider Poland a safe country to live in (fi g. 19). Less than one-fourth of respondents have the opposite views (24 per cent). Th e opinions on this issue are the most positive in the entire period of the
Th ird Republic (fi g. 20).

4 Th e age of 65 years (the same for females and males) is used as the so-called elderly threshold in documents prepared by the
UN.

Th e Report from the Survey Conducted by the CBOS at Request of the National Security Bureau, January 2012. Th e survey was

Th e conviction that Poland is a safe country to live in is predominant in all social and demographic groups. It is less common, however, among people with lower fi nancial status. At this point
it is worth noting that the question whether Poland is a safe country to live in may rather make the
respondents think of “daily” threats (such as crime) rather than in terms of “global” national security.
Nevertheless, this does describe an important psychosocial context of national security.

### WHITE BOOKTON NATIONAL SECURITY OF THE REPUBLIC OF POLAND

Th e public awareness surveys show that there is a relatively high sense of security among Poles
and generally a low level of anxiety about a loss of sovereignty and independence. Th e dangers experienced in recent years, such as the economic crisis, social unrest, and crime, are perceived as the most
real. Th e hierarchy of threats in terms of their perceived reality is shown in table 3.

Table 3. Answer to the question: What, and to what extent, may currently and in the near feature
constitute a real threat to the security of the Republic of Poland?

|What, and to what extent, may currently and in the near feature constitute a real threat to the security of the Republic of Poland?|Average on the scale from 0 to 10|

According to Poles, the most real threats are the ones they are familiar with. Th is is therefore,
in some sense, a picture of “fears tamed”. Th e social and economic threats are more real than the one
associated with disasters and military operations. Also the threats resulting from unintended events
are considered more real than the ones being a consequence of intentional actions. It is a paradox that,
despite the generally positive assessment of the institutions responsible for the state’s security, the level
of the state’s preparedness to face terrorist, military, or environmental threats or natural disasters is perceived as low. Apparently, Poles assess these institutions more in terms of trust/sympathy that in terms
of effi ciency (we like the army, which does not mean that we trust it will defend us).

In the opinion of the public, the state’s security depends largely on the activity of numerous
institutions, primarily national and international ones (table 4). Interestingly, the majority of re

-----

spondents did not say about any of the institutions mentioned that their activity has a major impact
on the state’s security.

|Table 4. Hierarchy of perceived impact on security.|Col2|

Note: the above are net indicators being the diff erence between the following proportions:

(major impact + high impact) – (minor impact + no impact)

_Source: authors’ own compilation based on the “Assessment of the State of National Security...” op.cit._

Worth noting is a relatively high position of the media, as well as the comparison to previous
results concerning the probability of specifi c threats. Th ese threats were mostly of economic and social
nature, and those who may be important from the point of view of such threats have, in the respondents’
opinion, the least impact on them (citizens, local governments and entrepreneurs).

In the eyes of the public, all important institutions which are signifi cant from the point of view of
Poland’s security perform their role well. From among these institutions, the activity of the fi re service
is assessed most positively (82 per cent of positive opinions). Approximately three-quarters of Poles are
satisfi ed with the activity of the army (77 per cent) and the Police (74 per cent). Similarly, three-quarters
of those surveyed believe that NATO serves well the security of Poland.

More than two thirds of respondents (69 per cent) are of the opinion that Polish authorities
perform their role well in ensuring security of Poland. Th e same proportion of people (68 per cent) appreciate the importance of Poland’s membership in the European Union for the security of the state. Th e
majority of respondents (61 per cent) are satisfi ed with the activity of the secret servicess. More than the
half surveyed (58 per cent) assess positively the role of local government authorities.

Th e most obvious relationship for respondents exists between security and having a modern
army and being a member of military alliances. Th e vast majority of people (80 per cent) also recognize
the importance of the economic development level for security of the state.

In the opinion of respondents, all that can be called a high level of the societal potential serves
the strengthening of security (fi g. 21): citizens’ trust in authorities (72 per cent), authorities’ trust in
citizens (69 per cent), and the existence of the strong civil society (66 per cent). Th e majority surveyed


-----

### WHITE BOOKTON NATIONAL SECURITY OF THE REPUBLIC OF POLAND

(59 per cent) also believe that the existence of a democratic system in the country strengthens the security (as apparently – in the opinion of the public – democratic countries are less likely to engage in
armed confl icts than the non-democratic ones).

Most respondents (75 per cent) think that the occurrence of strong social confl icts may contribute to the weakening of national security. Th e largest proportion of respondents (43 per cent) deems
the existence of a multicultural and ethnically diverse society to be a factor rather negatively aff ecting
the level of security.

Figure 21. Answer to the question: In your opinion, what does the security of the country depend
on? Please state the signifi cance for state security of each of the issues mentioned.

_Source: Assessment of the State of National Security..., op.cit._

Th e majority of factors which aff ect the state of national security are – in the opinion of respondents – rather strongly or very strongly correlated. Th e public believe that the military power of the
state is connected with the level of its economic development. What is more, the economic power (so
indirectly the military power) is, according to the public, related to a specifi c model of social cohesion
which is based on trust and democratic mechanisms for the elaboration of social consensus. One of the
elements of this model, which is also connected with the high degree of economic development (and –
perhaps – with the low level of social inequality), is low intensity of social confl icts.

Th e existence of a multicultural, ethnically diverse society is poorly correlated with other factors. Th e analyses show only a strong relation between functioning of the multicultural society and the
perceived high intensity of social confl icts.

DIAGNOSIS OF THE STATE OF NATIONAL SECURITY

Th e majority of Poles (75 per cent) believe Poland’s independence is not threatened at the moment. At the same time, 13 per cent surveyed are convinced that such a danger exists.

Th e only period since the beginning of Poland’s political system changes when most respondents
saw a threat to its sovereignty was early 1991; the Soviet Union still existed then. Aft er its collapse, the
majority of respondents were no longer concerned much about independence. With time, the proportion of people concerned about the curtailment or loss of sovereignty has gradually been dwindling.

Th e belief that at present Poland’ independence is not threatened prevails among all social and
demographic groups (fi g. 22). Most of the respondents concerned about Poland’s independence are
among the religious population – who participate in religious activities every week (31 per cent), as
well as among those who claim to have right-wing views (22 per cent). Moreover, people who are not
satisfi ed with their living conditions, pensioners (23 per cent), and unemployed (21 per cent) tend to
express their concerns about Poland’s independence more frequently.

People who saw a danger of Poland losing or having its sovereignty curtailed were further asked
what – in their opinion – this threat was. What is it that threatens Poland’s independence?

Respondents indicated in their answers both the kinds and possible sources of threats. Generally, the external threats were mentioned more frequently than the internal ones, although in some cases
it was diffi cult to distinguish one from another. Nearly one-fi ft h surveyed (19 per cent) see a threat to
the sovereignty of the state from its neighbours; however – in their opinion – the threat comes mostly
from Russia. Th e problem which was raised more oft en was the energy dependence on Russia. Just
slightly fewer respondents (17 per cent) pointed to the risks associated with membership in the European Union. Th e concerns stem mainly from federalization of the European Union and the associated
processes of the transfer of the state’s competence to the Union authorities.

A large portion of comments referred to economic threats: on the one hand, associated with the
presence of foreign capital in Poland and associated economic dependence (13 per cent in total) and, on
the other hand, with the fi nancial crisis and the excessive debt of the country (9 per cent).

Nearly one in eight people (12 per cent) pointed to military threats, such as an outbreak of war,
an international confl ict, or a terrorist attack. Th e danger connected with the potential deployments of
the US missiles was also mentioned. Some respondents (8 per cent in total) mentioned threats resulting
from the inappropriate – in their opinion – policy of the government or simply pointed to the menace
to Poland’s political sovereignty or the lack of sovereignty in the government’s decision-making.

Various internal threats were also mentioned (7 per cent) such as, inter alia, confl icts and tensions among various social groups, immigration, separatist tendencies, the progressing loss of national
and cultural identity by Poles, as well as the weakening of traditional values.

Generally, people who saw a threat to Poland’s independence and sovereignty most frequently
indicated that the threat is of the economic nature and is associated with the dependence on other states
as well as on the fi nancial and economic institutions (50 per cent). Nearly one in three people (31 per
cent) saw a threat to the state’s sovereignty in Poland’s political dependence and the lack of autonomy
of Polish authorities in decision-making. Poland’s military security causes least concern – only one in
ten respondents who saw threats to the state’s independence considered an attack on Poland’s territory
a serious possibility. Th e above is shown in fi g. 23.

Despite the positive assessment of the role of institutions in ensuring Poland’s security, the prevailing conviction is that the country is not prepared adequately to act in emergency and unforeseen
situations (fi g. 24) – whether caused by the forces of nature or negligence on the part of people, or
planned and organized by forces hostile to Poland. Such situations include e.g. fl oods, which were experienced by Poles several times in recent years. Th is is probably the reason for the particularly severe
criticism of the state’s preparedness to encounter natural disasters (61 per cent of negative answers, and
23 per cent of the positive ones).

DIAGNOSIS OF THE STATE OF NATIONAL SECURITY

In recent years Poles have not experienced any of the other situations aforesaid, such as an environmental disaster (on a large scale), a military attack on the territory of Poland, or a terrorist attack, Th at
is why it is all the more diffi cult for them to fully assess the state’s preparedness for any of these situations.
Most of respondents, however, are concerned with Poland not being well prepared for such events.

Figure 24. Answer to the question: Is the Republic of Poland suffi cienty (or insuffi ciently) prepared to
take action in the event of:

_Source: Assessment of the State of National Security..., op.cit._

In conclusion, Poles consider themselves to be rather poorly prepared to deal with threats and
believe to be relatively less prepared to deal with the unintentional threats than the intentional ones.
In the areas in which threats are considered more real there are weak actors. What is also important
is the discrepancy observed between the favourable assessment of institutions responsible for security
and the weak assessment of their preparedness to face threats. One of the explanations for this may be
that the assessment is made considering the trust/sympathy rather than the perceived eff ectiveness (we
value these institutions, which does not mean that they will be eff ective).

It is important to be prepared to face new social phenomena which are important from the
point of view of national security. Th is concerns above all the new areas of confl icts, their new participants, as well as the new forms of expressing discontent[6]. As far as the forms of discontent are
concerned, these may include not only open rebellions but also numerous strategies for “going beyond
the system” in the form of refusal to participate, emigration, and escape into the unoffi cial zones. Even
today a greater threat to security results from the lack of civic activity then from some forms of mass,
radical and non-civic participation. Th e new areas of confl ict, on the other hand, are the consequence
of the evolution from the traditional industrial patterns to the post-industrial era, where the reason is
not so much the frustration over the lack of access to material goods but rather the intangible goods
which are increasingly critical for social success – such as health, education, culture, and information.
Th e third feature concerns the participants: mainly the groups of professionals. Th e protesters include
university students, school students, patients, doctors, and not just industrial workers. Th e authorities
(the entire state system), however, still seem to be better prepared to face confl icts and threats to the
security of the old type.

6 Admittedly, these are not recent phenomena. Th eir occurrence was already signalled in the study entitled “Th reats to Social
Stability” prepared for the Economic Advisory Team of the President of the Republic of Poland to the “Memorandum on Economic Th reats to Social Life in Poland” drawn up by the team in October 2002.

### WHITE BOOKTON NATIONAL SECURITY OF THE REPUBLIC OF POLAND

With the emergence of new social phenomena, the activity of the civil society becomes particularly important. Th e new threats and confl icts, including these perceived by the public as the most
real, are of social and economic nature. Th e nature of confl icts of the post-industrial era makes the civil
society, as it were, a natural actor, important from the point of view of regulating and resolving these
confl icts (note that the civil society does not mean only the offi cial organizations of the third sector,
but also the local unoffi cial self-help neighbourhood network; such ties are also created through the
Internet network, which is free from any geographical constraints). Incorporating this type of local
communities and bonds into the national security system constitutes a challenge for its architects.
**Institutions of education for security. In accordance with the present conceptual solutions,**
the organization and provision of education for security is in the hands of a number of ministries.
Th ese include: the Ministry of National Education, the Ministry of Science and Higher Education, the
Ministry of National Defence, and the Ministry of the Interior. Th e educational tasks in the area of security are also performed by the formations subordinate to the Ministry of the Interior (the Police, the
State Fire Service, and the Border Guard) as well as to the Ministry of National Defence (the Military
Centre for Civil Education, Wojskowe Centrum Edukacji Obywatelskiej).
Apart from the central institutions, education for security is also provided in local government
centres at the level of province, district, commune, and town, as well as in companies important from
the point of view of the security and defence of the state.
Important elements of the system of education for security are public and non-public higher
education institutions. Higher education institutions off er the fi rst-, second-, and third-degree courses
on national security and internal security. According to the data of the Ministry of Science and Higher
Education, there are 83 higher education institutions off ering such courses.
As far as the defence education is concerned, the National Defence Academy (Akademia Obro_ny Narodowej) continues to play the major role in this area. Among other things, it off ers education in_
the fi eld of defence to representatives of the central and local government administration in the form
of defence courses (wyższe kursy obronne).
Other important institutions in the system of education for security include the non-governmental organizations and associations. Th e organizations which are most engaged in these activities
include, inter alia, the Polish Scouting and Guiding Association (Związek Harcerstwa Polskiego), the
Scouting Association of the Republic (Związek Harcerstwa Rzeczypospolitej), the Rifl emen’s Association “Strzelec” (Związek Strzelecki “Strzelec”), the Police Sports Association (Policyjne Towarzystwo
_Sportowe), the Association of Military Tradition and Culture (Stowarzyszenie Kulturalne i Tradycji_
_Wojskowej), the Association of Soldiers of the National Armed Forces (Związek Żołnierzy Narodowych_
_Sił Zbrojnych), the Association of War Invalids (Związek Inwalidów Wojennych), veteran associations,_
the National Defence League (Liga Obrony Kraju), and the Polish Red Cross (Polski Czerwony Krzyż).
Th e educational activities of organizations specializing in mountain (Mountain Volunteer Search and
Rescue, _Górskie Ochotnicze Pogotowie Ratunkowe, GOPR, and Tatra Volunteer Search and Rescue,_
_Tatrzańskie Ochotnicze Pogotowie Ratunkowe, TOPR) and water rescue (WOPR) are worth noting._
When evaluating the education for security in Poland one concludes that it attains an increasingly higher level in lower and upper secondary training. Nevertheless, the present educational processes
use various curricula and capabilities. In order for these processes to be eff ective, the educational activity should be controlled centrally by a single institution. Consequently, this area requires structural
and organizational changes.
Th e eff ectiveness of the education for security depends largely on the adjustment of its objectives contents and organization to the constantly changing needs in the field of structural and personal

security, as well as on rational linking of the factor of attractiveness of this education with the proper
preparation of the teaching staff and securing the material and fi nancial base.
Moreover, there is no supra-ministerial academic centre in the group of state higher education
institutions, which could be tasked with providing education in the fi eld of integrated security (external and internal; military and non-military) and encompass all didactic activities in this area, going
beyond just the specialist and professional (ministerial) or general academic scope.
**R&D in the fi eld of security. Th e Ministry of Science and Higher Education is the main centre**
for the promotion of Polish science policy. Th e 2010 reform of the science system allowed the Ministry to
assume the role of a coordination centre in this scope. Th e fi nancing of scientifi c studies and research projects was entrusted to the National Science Centre (Narodowe Centrum Nauki) and the National Centre for
Research and Development (Narodowe Centrum Badań i Rozwoju) as the executive agencies of the Ministry.
Th e National Science Centre supports the scientifi c activities regarding basic research undertaken primarily to acquire new knowledge about the underlying foundations of phenomena and observable facts, without any direct practical application or use.
Th e applied research, oriented towards practical application, is the domain of the National Centre for Research and Development, which is responsible for the management of strategic programmes
of scientifi c R&D work (including R&D work for the purposes of the state’s security and defence). It
also fi nances or co-fi nances such programmes.
In Poland, the basic and applied research and the developmental work are conducted mainly
by higher education institutions (basic organization units of higher education institutions), scientifi c
institutes of the Polish Academy of Sciences (Polska Akademia Nauk, PAN), as well as by research
institutes, R&D centres, and enterprises.
Basic research in the fi eld of security and defence of the state is just being developed. It is mainly due to the fact that the science of security and the science of defence, which constitute the subject
of the research, were created in 2011.
At present, only two higher education institutions can award the degree of doctor habilitatus in the
aforementioned disciplines. Th ese institutions include: the Academy of National Defence and the Naval
Academy (Akademia Marynki Wojennej). Th e Police Academy in Szczytno can award the doctoral degree
in the discipline of security science. Th e academies also conduct basic research as part of fi nancing of the
statutory activity (the National Science Centre does not fi nance the basic research in the fi eld of security
and defence). Other higher education institutions and science centres concentrate on research and developmental work in the fi eld of security and defence only in the aspect of technical sciences.
Th e applied research in the fi eld of national security and defence are, in turn, conducted mainly
to the order of the Ministry of National Defence and the Ministry of the Interior. Proposals concerning
research projects and programmes to be fi nanced by the National Centre for Research and Development are submitted also by the Internal Security Agency.

Th e priority areas in the realm of R&D work for security and defence of the state include:

-  For the Ministry of National Defence (MON): information and network technologies; sensors and
observation; precision weapons and armaments; unmanned (autonomous) platforms; protection
and survival in the battlefi eld; and modern materials, including high-energy and smart materials;

-  For the Minister of the Interior (MSW): modern technologies and innovative solutions for detecting,
combating, and neutralizing threats; forensic technology; individual protection means and equipment;
social prevention, victimology, criminology, and social research; organization and management.

### WHITE BOOKTON NATIONAL SECURITY OF THE REPUBLIC OF POLAND

Th e diagnosis of existing solutions in R&D work in the fi eld of national security and defence
indicates that at present the sectoral system of planning and implementation of research activities
prevails. As a result, we face a situation where the limited fi nancial resources are allocated for strictly
ministerial projects instead of the capital being accumulated in cross-ministerial programmes and
projects which would integrate the defence (military) and protection (non-military) spheres of the
national security system.

In this context, it is important to note the amount of funds spent on the R&D activities. In 2012,
the funds allocated for science amounted to PLN 6.4 billion. R&D work in the fi eld of national security
and defence were fi nanced in the amount of PLN 300 million (which is more than PLN 118 million
less than the subsidy allocated for this purpose in 2011).

Another weakness of the current solutions regarding programmes and developmental work
aimed at improving the security and defence capabilities of the state is the lack of a well-developed
cooperation platform between the fi nal recipient (end user) and the scientifi c team and industry, especially during the key stages of implementation of such programmes and projects.

**Th e intellectual, scientifi c and technological potential. Th e national security of contempo-**
rary countries depends to a large extent on their intellectual and technological potential. According
to studies analysing the changes taking place in the countries with most dynamic technological and
intellectual capacities, the potential of these countries is strongly linked to “knowledge institutions”
such as: universities, research centres, technological parks, as well as innovative educational and social
programmes. Th e transition to the networked economy, IT development, as well as social stability and
extending the spheres of democratization of public life goes hand in hand with the strong innovativeness by national knowledge institutions.

Some of the indicators of the IT potential include: the number of students on given types of
courses, the scale of research and patents. Referring to the OECD report[7] presenting the number of
students of specifi c disciplines we can say that Poland has reached a high level of potential associated
with education in social, pedagogical, and economic sciences, and a low level of potential in disciplines
which are nowadays considered crucial, i.e. technology and engineering.

At present, one of the problems connected with the Polish IT potential is migration of researchers to centres located in Western Europe and the USA. It is worthwhile to note that not only
the best scientists but also representatives of the world of culture and art choose easier careers
abroad, which eff ects the image of Poland as a peripheral country.

**Th e media in the national security system. Th e media, broadly understood as means of public**
communication, undergo deep changes. Th e previous development of the media was associated with
the emergence of new media – from large-circulation newspapers and magazines, through radio to television. Th e current changes are connected with digitization, as a result of which the former media are
transformed and the new ones appear. Digitization has led to the emergence of network media (the Internet), which use various services – data transmission, electronic mail, web pages, and community portals.

Th ere are multiple relationships between the media and national security. Th e media, both
factually and potentially, help identify threats. Moreover, they inform the public about the threats and
about the ways of repelling them. Th e media also stimulate pro-public attitudes, which is an essential
premise of the democratic order, including the formation of “democratic security”.

DIAGNOSIS OF THE STATE OF NATIONAL SECURITY

Eff ective cooperation of the media with entities responsible for crisis management appears
extremely important – most frequently the media shape public awareness of a given threat. Th erefore,
they can widely educate the public about preventing and eff ectively coping with threats as well as
about cooperation with crisis management authorities responsible for the area inhabited by a given
community.

Th e media should show the population the topics and problems deserving public interest.
Meanwhile, in recent years, due to business requirements, the media have been undergoing the
process of tabloidization – in pursuit of the widest possible audience the media subordinate the
information to sensation which is supposed to attract the interest of the largest possible group of
recipients. In case of accumulated negative information this may greatly arouse the general sense of
security collapse. Media reports too oft en dramatise and personalise the message – both in terms of
form and contents. Th at is why common themes in the media are violent events or human tragedy
such as catastrophes or acts of terrorism.

**Th e health service in the national security system. Th e Ministry of Health is responsible,**
_inter alia, for the organization of the health care system, health policy, and drug policy. Legal tools_
at the disposal of the minister of health allow him to carry out policy as part of the state’s constitutional obligation which consist, among other things, in providing each citizen with the right
to protection of health, equal access to health care services fi nanced from public funds, ensuring
special health care for children, pregnant women, the disabled, and elderly persons, as well as fi ghting epidemic diseases and preventing negative health consequences of environmental degradation.
In the current legal framework, when fulfi lling the constitutional obligation to provide access to
medical services, including in crisis situations, it is important to consider the fact that all activities
of entities authorized to provide medical services and the organizational and logistic support result
solely from the authorities’ competence under the law, while eff ective, fully modern and competent
medical assistance should be the result of collaboration and cooperation of all units and emergency,
technical, medical, and administrative services. When referring to the state authorities responsible
for ensuring the required level of health care, it should be noted that this competence is not only in
the hands of the minister of health, but also of central and local government administration bodies.

One of the challenges for health care in the context of security tasks of the state is the shortfall of clear rules concerning cooperation and collaboration with the minister of national defence,
resulting, inter alia, from the so-called precedence of the needs of the armed forces over other needs, as well as the lack of a consistent policy on management and administration of staff reserves.
Lacking are also uniform and consistent rules (including of fi nancing) adjusting health care units
to effi cient implementation of tasks for uniformed services as well as the readiness of these units
to carry out specifi c defence tasks. In a situation where more and more health care entities undergo restructuring by changing their legal form (non-public health institution, niepubliczne zakłady
_opieki zdrowotnej), the issue of fi nancing or refi nancing the implementation of certain defence tasks_
creates a number of issues for the authorities responsible for the organization of the assignment and
launching of such tasks.

Another problem is that there is no possibility to isolate patients suff ering from infectious diseases transmitted from person to person. Individual provinces had designated places for isolation and
quarantine, but aft er inspecting them more closely it was found that these facilities could be of use for
quarantine purposes only and were not suitable for isolation. Consequently, the chances to prevent the


-----

### WHITE BOOKTON NATIONAL SECURITY OF THE REPUBLIC OF POLAND

spread of particularly dangerous diseases do not look good. Once the local stocks are exhausted, the
logistics of launching and securing the supplies of new medicines, medical materials and equipment
from the state reserves to sites of events would pose a problem.

-  * *

When analyzing Poland’s societal potential, it is important to stress its numerous weaknesses
which do or will aff ect national security. It concerns, in particular, the social, demographic, educational and cognitive, media and health care areas.

At present, Poland has a signifi cant demographic potential. However, if the low birth rate continues, the situation will start changing in the near future. Th e resulting phenomena such as the deformation of the age structure of the population and the ageing of society will directly result in problems
in the socio-economic sphere.

Th e stratifi cation of society, including large areas of poverty, remains one of major problems
in Poland. Th is phenomenon, along with the high level of unemployment and the noticeable change
of the traditional family structure, leads to the deterioration of social bonds, the growth of extreme
and populist attitudes, and, as a consequence, to social unrest, which directly undermines national
security.

When assessing the societal potential, attention should also be paid to the shortcomings in
disseminating the knowledge about security. As a result, the awareness of needs, conditions and
tasks in the area of security among citizens and social structures is insuffi cient. Th e level of such
awareness among the major state structures that are not directly responsible for security is not
satisfactory either, in particular in terms of their relevant responsibilities. All these elements have,
to a certain extent, a limiting eff ect on the defi nition of national interests and strategic objectives in
the fi eld of security.

Th e economic security potential

Security and development are two fundamental aspects of functioning of the state. Th ey are
also inextricably linked with each other. On the one hand, without an appropriate level of security, it
is not possible to ensure stable and long-term development of economy. On the other hand, without
development a continuous necessary improvement of the national security potential would not happen.

Th e economic security potential (in combination with the political will of the decision makers)
constitutes the basis for defi ning the power, eff ectiveness and international position of a state.

In 2011, in terms of the gross domestic product calculated at purchasing power parity, Poland
took the twentieth place among the world’s biggest economies with GDP estimated at USD 768 billion.

It accounted for ca. 5 per cent of the value of economy of the entire European Union, but 25 per
cent of the German economy, 33 per cent of the economies of Russia, France or the UK, as well as more
than 40 per cent of the economy of Italy, and 50 per cent of the economy of Spain. In the same year,
however, the level of economic development measured by GDP per capita at purchasing power parity
accounted for more than 43 per cent of the average for the United States and approximately 64 per cent of

the average for the entire EU. At the same time it represented ca 52.8 per cent of the value of this indicator
in Germany, 58.7 per cent in Great Britain, 59.2 per cent in France, 64 per cent in Italy, and 65.3 per cent
in Spain. It is important to note, however, that in years 2001–2011 the relative GDP per capita in Poland
increased by ca. 16 per cent in relation to the European Union and about 13 per cent in relation to the
USA[8]. It was due to the continuous growth of GDP during that period, in particular aft er 2008, i.e. during
the global crisis (fi g 25).

From the global point of view, Poland can be considered a relatively highly developed country;
nevertheless, there is still a large gap between Poland and the most developed countries, as evidenced,
_inter alia, by the structure of economy and the corresponding employment structure – 13 per cent of the_
population work in agriculture (the EU average is 5 per cent, while in some of the countries, e.g. USA, it
is even less than 2 per cent) and only 57 per cent in the sector of services (the EU average – 68 per cent).
A relatively large number of people work in industry (30 per cent, while the EU average is 26 per cent),
which is a legacy from the period of centrally planned economy.

A major problem of Polish economy is a persistent high unemployment rate (at present, the
rate of unemployment is about 13.4 per cent – as of December 2012), but there is no clarity as to
the methods of its estimation (it is diffi cult, e.g. to determine the scale of hidden unemployment in
agriculture). A better indicator of professional activity of the population is the proportion of working
age population that is employed. In Poland this ratio is approximately 59 per cent, which diff ers from
the European average of 64 per cent, and even more from such countries as the Netherlands – 77 per
cent, and Denmark – 75 per cent. Select indicators presenting macroeconomic changes in Poland are

**Poland in international economic relations. An important dimension of the economic status**
consists not only in the size of economy or the level of its development, but also in the share in foreign
trade, and particularly in the export competitiveness. When analysing the competitiveness of Polish
economy in this fi eld, it is important to note, primarily, the systematic growth of Polish export value. In
years 2000–2011, exports increased almost three and half times from EUR 39 billion to EUR 139 billion,
while at the same time imports increased by nearly 3.5 times from EUR 52 billion to EUR 149 billion
(fi g. 27). Th e large increase in exports in the last decade was to a large extent associated with the infl ow
of direct foreign investments in processing industries. It is evidenced by the fact that from 2000 to 2008
the most noticeable export increase was in the sectors of economy in which the largest direct foreign
investment infl ow was noted.

Regarding the development of competitiveness in foreign trade, particularly important is the
analysis of the export structure and indicators of revealed relative advantage, carried out with the use
of various quality classifi cations of processing industries, including the technological level, the use
of material and intangible input, and workforce qualifi cations. When analysing the changes in the
Polish export structure, from the technological point of view it should be noted that the key positive
change in the last decade was the decline in the share of exports in low-tech industries accompanied
by the increase in the share of export of medium-high technology industries and, during the last two
decades, also of high-tech branches. During this entire period the largest share in exports of Polish
processing industries was noted in medium-high technology sectors.

DIAGNOSIS OF THE STATE OF NATIONAL SECURITY

When analyzing Polish exports in terms of the classifi cation of industries and according to the
use of tangible and intangible factors of production, it is important to note the positive trends, such
as a substantial decline in the share of labour-intensive industries, as well as – although to a moderate
extent – strengthening of the position in other industries, in particular those based on research and
marketing. Moreover, Polish workforce qualifi cations are also improving.

Th e infl ows of direct foreign investment in Poland grew signifi cantly aft er its accession to the
European Union. Th e value of direct foreign investments located in the Polish economy has increased
by EUR 84 billion and at the end of 2011 reached EUR 147.7 billion. Th e sectoral structure of foreign
investments in Poland has changed since then as well. Initially, in the 1990s most of foreign investment
infl ows were concentrated in production sectors as well as in trade and less advanced services. With
time, however, the investments in fi nancial services and, since 2004, also in real estate and company
services, especially in various business services, started to grow. Poland attracted more investors not
only due to lower costs (owing, inter alia, to inexpensive workforce), but also due to the higher quality
of rendered services and qualifi ed workers.

**Financial security. Th e most important aspects of the fi nancial security of the state are: stability**
of the fi nancial sector, the size of the public debt, as well as the size and structure of the state’s foreign
currency reserves.

**_Financial security institutions. Th e fi nancial sector, including the banking sector, plays a si-_**
gnifi cant role in the economic development of the country. Financial sector institutions perform the
role of an intermediary, transforming fi nancial savings of citizens into investment needs of economy.
Transformation of savings into investments is a very complex and risky process. Wrong investment of
funds by fi nancial intermediaries leads to their bankruptcy, which causes further bankruptcies of those
who entrusted their fi nancial resources to them. Due to this specifi city of fi nancial intermediation, the
sector is regulated and supervised by various public institutions which form a fi nancial security network. Th e most important fi nancial security institutions in Poland include: the Council of Ministers,
the Ministry of Finance, the Polish Financial Supervision Authority, the National Bank of Poland, and
the Bank Guarantee Fund.


-----

### WHITE BOOKTON NATIONAL SECURITY OF THE REPUBLIC OF POLAND

Th e Polish government has two important crisis response tools at its disposal. Pursuant to the
Act of 12 February 2009 on the State Treasury Support for Financial Institutions, the government can
provide liquidity support to banks and certain fi nancial institutions. On the basis of the Act of 12 February 2010 on the Recapitalization of Certain Financial Institutions, the Council of Ministers can
provide capital to certain fi nancial institutions or take them over. Th e aforementioned instruments are
associated with the use of public funds. Th ey are also of temporary nature, depending on the European
Commission’s approval for their use.

Th e Polish Financial Supervision Authority (Komisja Nadzoru Finansowego, KNF) plays a signifi cant role in ensuring fi nancial security. It is tasked with the supervision of the fi nancial market,
including, inter alia, the banking, pension, and insurance supervision as well as the supervision over
the capital market. Th e aim of the supervision is to ensure proper functioning of the fi nancial market,
its stability, security and transparency, to build trust in the market as well as to ensure protection of its
participants’ interests. Th e supervision by the KNF is focused on the secure functioning of individual
institutions and thereby indirectly on security and stability of the entire fi nancial market.

In turn, the National Bank of Poland (Narodowy Bank Polski, NBP) promotes the stability of the
banking sector and – provided appropriate security is established – ensures liquidity of the banks. Th e
National Bank of Poland contributes to fi nancial stability also indirectly – by taking responsibility for the
stability of prices as well as supporting the government’s economic policy, unless its policy contradicts the
objective of the stability. Th e monetary policy of the NBP has been implemented since the end of 1998
as part of the direct infl ation targeting strategy. One of its elements is the fl oating exchange rate regime.

Another important fi nancial security institution is the Bank Guarantee Fund (Bankowy Fundusz
_Gwarancyjny). Th e Fund’s fundamental tasks include: payment of the guaranteed funds up to the_
amount determined by the law (at present, an equivalent of EUR 100 thousand) in the event of a suspension of a bank’s activity as well as the provision of fi nancial help to banks at risk of insolvency.

Th e aforementioned fi nancial security institutions, within their competence, are responsible for
the stability and security of the fi nancial system in Poland. Th ey enjoy a broad mandate and have a range of crisis prevention and management tools.

Th e experience of the current global fi nancial crisis as well as the fi nancial security standards
introduced around the world indicate that the fi nancial security network in Poland needs to be supplemented. One of the threats might be also that the activities of non-bank organizations, i.e. companies
performing banking activities and providing fi nancial services, which do not have the legal status of
a bank, are poorly regulated. Th e accumulation of large, multi-billion savings outside fi nancial supervision increases the risk of speculative bubbles. A crash caused by the bursting of such a speculative
bubble can lead to a signifi cant decline in the value of savings and, as a further consequence, to an
economic downturn.

**_Foreign currency reserves of the National Bank of Poland. Foreign currency reserves, their ac-_**
cumulation, management, as well as ensuring the security of foreign exchange dealing are some of the
major tasks of the NBP as the central foreign exchange banking institution of the state.

Under the fl oating exchange rate regime the aim of foreign currency reserves is to strengthen the
fi nancial credibility of the state by reducing the costs of fi nancing on global markets and the likelihood
of withholding access to this source of fi nancing, as well as by limiting the risk of sudden capital outfl ows (including speculative attacks). Foreign currency reserves can also be used to support the stability

DIAGNOSIS OF THE STATE OF NATIONAL SECURITY

of fi nancial markets and of the banking sector, inter alia, by ensuring currency liquidity in conditions of
disfunctionalities of fi nancial markets.

Th e accumulated reserve assets of the National Bank securely cover the potential joint needs as
regards fi nancing the banking sector in foreign currencies, corresponding – in an extreme scenario – to
all currency liabilities vis-à-vis foreign fi nancial institutions as well as to open balance sheet currency
position. At the end of November 2012, the offi cial reserve assets of the Bank reached EUR 82.7 billion,
increasing by EUR 6.7 billion (8 per cent) since the beginning of the year, and by EUR 38 billion (85 per
cent) over the past fi ve years.

Th e strategy of managing the foreign currency reserves ensures an appropriate level of security
and liquidity of funds. It is therefore reasonable to continue to follow this strategy taking into consideration the market conditions, in particular the fi nancial risk profi le, as well as changes taking place in
the global economy and the international fi nancial system.

**_Public debt. In Poland, the limitations of the public debt amount are specifi ed in the Consti-_**
tution of the Republic of Poland and the Act on Public Finance. Th e constitution sets the limit of the
public debt at the level of 60 per cent of the GDP. Th e Act on Public Finance, in turn, determines the
method of calculating the public debt – the so-called prudence limits – at the levels of 50 per cent, 55
per cent, and 60 per cent of the GDP, as well as sanctions resulting from exceeding such limits.

Th e level of public debt is still close to the constitutional limit (fi g. 28). Th is situation results, to
a large extent, from the general imbalance of the public fi nance sector. It combines a large – although
not so disturbing as in other countries – public debt and the defi cit of the public fi nance sector, which
is strongly correlated with the economic cycle.

**Th e pension system. In the next few years, the stable functioning of the pension system is thre-**
atened by the unfavourable demographic changes. Th e system rests on three pillars: the fi rst one is the
Social Insurance Institution (Zakład Ubezpieczeń Społecznych); the second one includes Open Pension
Funds (Otwarte Fundusze Emerytalne, OFE) – with 15.7 million accounts as of June 2012; the third
one consists of Individual Pension Accounts (Pol. _Indywidualne Konta Emerytalne, IKE), Individual_
Pension Security Accounts (Indywidualne Konta Zabezpieczenia _Emerytalnego, IKZE), and Employee_
Pension Accounts (Pracownicze Programy Emerytalne, PPE) – with more than 1.18 million accounts as
at the end of March 2012. Th e total value of the OFE assets as of June 2012 was PLN 241.1 billion. In
the fi rst pillar, the money to pay out pensions is funded by the contributions paid today, in the second
pillar, the money from contributions is invested by the OFE, while in the third pillar the future pensioners decide on their own the amount of contributions paid. In accordance with the amended Act on the
Organization and Functioning of Pensions Funds which entered into force in the 2[nd] quarter of 2011,
the major part of the contributions is supposed to be paid to the Public Insurance Institution instead
of to the OFE (previously 7.3 per cent of contribution was paid to OFE; at present it is 2.3 per cent).

In addition, in Poland there is a separate social insurance system for farmers, based on the Agricultural Social Insurance Fund (Kasa Rolniczego Ubezpieczenia Społecznego, KRUS). At the end of 2011,
there were 1 516 318 people insured by the KRUS, while 1 326 638 people collected benefi ts. Th e
number of insured by the KRUS falls every year. Th e payment of benefi ts under this scheme is based, to
a large extent, on subsidies from the state budget.

**Energy security. Th e legal basis of the Polish energy security system is the act of 10 April 1997**
– the Energy Law. Th e act is continuously amended, which is mainly due to the dynamics of legislative
changes at the European level. Th e energy law sets forth the principles for the development of the state’s
energy policy, the rules and terms of the supply and use of fuels and energy, including heating, and the
activity of energy companies, as well as it specifi es the bodies responsible for fuel and energy management.

Over the past decades, a series of strategic documents determined the main directions of development of the Polish energy policy. In principle, the documents were rather general and treated the
diversifi cation policy of natural gas supplies from abroad as a priority. Th eir political implementation,
however, proved to be extremely diffi cult. Th e lack of proper analyses which would summarise previous
studies should be assessed critically. Th e currently binding document is the Energy Policy of Poland
until 2030, which was adopted on 10 November 2009. Th e document was elaborated before the fi rst
information on potential shale basins in Poland appeared.

Additionally, in 2011, the Ministry of Economy and the Ministry of the Environment presented a draft document entitled: “Th e Strategy: Energy Security and the Environment”, which is one of
nine development strategies being prepared. It focuses on three fundamental objectives: sustainable
management of environmental resources, ensuring safe and competitive energy supply to the domestic
economy, and improving the condition of the environment.

**_Energy security entities. Th e most important institutions which have the impact on the energy_**
security policy are: the Council of Ministers, the minister of economy, the president of the Energy Regulatory Offi ce (Urząd Regulacji Energetyki, URE), province governors, as well as province and commune
local governments (district local government has only indirect impact on the state’s energy security,
_inter alia, by responsibilities associated with the spatial planning, connected with the implementation of_
all lines investments such as power transmission lines, gas pipelines, as well as crude oil and petroleum
products transmission infrastructure).


-----

DIAGNOSIS OF THE STATE OF NATIONAL SECURITY

According to the Act of 4 September 1997 on Government Administration Departments (działy
_administracji rządowej), the minister of economy is responsible for the implementation of the energy_
policy and is the main government administration authority in matters relating to this policy as well as
is the guarantor of maintaining energy security. Th e tasks of the minister of economy include, among
others: draft ing the energy policy of the state as well as coordinating its implementation; planning and
overseeing the fuel and energy supply to the state; exercising control over the security and stability of
supplies of gaseous fuels, electric power, as well as control of the state energy system; cooperating with
province governors and local governments in planning and implementing the supply of fuels and energy as well as coordinating cooperation with international organizations.

Th e Energy Regulatory Offi ce is subordinate to the minister of economy. Th e president of the
URE is tasked with implementing tasks relating to the regulation of the fuel and energy management
as well as supporting the competitiveness of the energy sector. It is also assigned to regulating the work
of energy enterprises in such a manner so as to balance their interests with interests of fuel and energy
consumers.

Other departments which play an important role in this regard include:

-  the Ministry of Treasury, which is qualifi ed for appointing and dismissing the governing bodies of
gas industry companies (production, distribution, trade), oil industry and the power industry, as
well as plays an important role in privatization process;

-  the Ministry of the Environment, which is responsible for rational use of natural energy resources,
including for issue of concessions for the exploration and exploitation of energy resources;

-  the Ministry of Transport, Construction and Maritime Economy, competent, inter alia, in matters
of transportation policy.

Th e group of entities that fulfi l direct and indirect tasks relating to energy security includes also
province governors and governing bodies of local governments. Th e local governments of provinces
provide opinions on the development plans of energy enterprises as well as the draft assumptions for
heating, electric power and gaseous fuel supply plans prepared by the communes. Th e task of the province local governments is to assess the compliance of the above documents with the Energy Policy of
Poland until 2030. Th e Energy Law, in turn, imposes on the municipalities tasks associated with: the
development of spatial management plans; planning and organizing the provision of heating, electric
power and gaseous fuels; and planning and fi nancing public lighting.

**_Energy raw materials and the storage capacities. According to the data published by the Pol-_**
ish Geological Institute (Państwowy Instytut Geologiczny, PGI), in Poland there are 84 documented
deposits of oil of total exploitable balance resources of 26.29 million tonnes, 279 conventional natural gas resources – of 146 billion cubic metres, nearly 100–120 thousand tonnes of natural uranium,
44 billion tonnes of hard coal and 14 billion tonnes of lignite. In March 2012, the Institute estimated
that the national shale gas resources are at the level of 346.1–767.9 billion cubic metres. In eff ect, the
deposits of hard coal and brown coal in Poland are suffi cient to ensure its energy security; however oil
and natural gas need to be imported.

Poland has geological structures which can be utilized for storing energy raw materials. Salt
caves (e.g. in Pomerania) which can be used for construction of tanks for crude oil and natural gas,
are particularly important in this regard. Poland has now eight underground storage sites for natural
gas, which belong to Polskie Górnictwo Naft owe i Gazownictwo company (PGNIG). Th eir total capacity is 2.06 billion cubic metres of natural gas, thereby allowing to storage this raw material for 45 days


-----

### WHITE BOOKTON NATIONAL SECURITY OF THE REPUBLIC OF POLAND

of average consumption. It is planned that the storage capacities will reach the level of 3 billion cubic
metres of natural gas by 2015.

Poland also has an adequate infrastructure for crude oil storage. Th e company PERN “Przyjaźń”
has three bases with a total capacity of 3 billion cubic metres of crude oil, but the capacity allocated
for intervention stocks is nearly 1.4 million cubic metres. PKN Orlen Capital Group operates crude oil
storage sites of total capacity of 6.4 million cubic metres, of which 5.8 million cubic metres is intended
for storage of crude oil and fuels.

Th e fuel and energy sector is characterized, inter alia, by uneven development, delays in modernization, obsolete technology, the ill-arranged structure of production assets, underinvestment (it
concerns mainly the production capacities and transmission infrastructure), and the lack of transborder connections.

**_Diversifi cation of energy raw material supplies. Th e national economy is dependent on sup-_**
plies of certain energy raw materials from external producers. More than 95 per cent of crude oil and
60 per cent of natural gas consumed in Poland is imported. Currently, the majority of these raw materials come from the Russian Federation.

Aiming at improving its energy security, Poland has taken measures at two levels: through the
process of physical diversifi cation of sources and routes of energy raw material supplies, and through
political activities supporting the creation of a legal and institutional environment in order to build
a free energy market within the European Union.

Work on the previous project of diversifi cation of crude oil supplies via the Odessa-BrodyPłock (Gdańsk) pipeline was focused on establishing a consortium (with 24.75 per cent of shares held
by the company PERN “Przyjaźń” S.A.) and putting it on the list of co-fi nanced projects. Natural gas
from Russia is supplied from two directions – nearly 3/5 of the contracted raw material is supplied via
Ukraine, while the other 2/5 is collected at two supply points of the Yamal pipeline.

According to the Yamal contract and its annex, starting from 2022 the PGNIG company will
purchase from the Russian Gazprom 10 billion cubic meters of natural gas per year, with a possible
deviation of 15 per cent from the contracted amount. Moreover, the PGNIG company has concluded
a contract with VNG-Verbundnetz Gas AG on natural gas supply to Lasowo in years 2006–2016 at the
level of 400 million cubic metres per year and with Vitol – on natural gas supply to Cieszyn in years
2011–2014 in the amount of 550 million cubic metres per year.

Polish shale gas deposits provide a great opportunity to gain independence from external suppliers. It is expected that the non-conventional gas deposits may contribute to a geopolitical change in
the region, becoming signifi cantly competitive for the current monopolists on European markets. Th e
experience of the United States connected with the utilization of shale gas in the economy indicated
that this raw material may have a substantial infl uence on the currents directions of supplies. It is
also estimated that Polish shale formations may contain as much as 215–268 million tonnes of liquid
hydrocarbons, the so-called shale oil. Th e Ministry of Environment has obligated the state-owned
companies to extract 400 million cubic meters – up to 1 billion cubic meters of shale gas by 2015. Th e
biggest Polish energy companies have invested a lot in the exploration and extraction of this raw material. However, a threat to shale gas extraction in Poland may be the attempts being made within the
European Union to limit or prohibit the exploitation of shale gas deposits with the use of the available
technologies, as well as the possible withdrawal of foreign companies from Poland which have thus

DIAGNOSIS OF THE STATE OF NATIONAL SECURITY

far been involved in the project and which hold the majority of exploration concessions issued by the
Polish authorities (fi g 29). Another diffi culty in shale gas extraction may also be the environmental
regulations in force in Poland (e.g. the Natura 2000 programme).

**_Energy infrastructure. Th e energy infrastructure is understood as a set of devices which in-_**
clude the following subsystems: electricity, CHP, gas, solid fuels, and liquid fuels. For the sake of state
security, the subsystems of electricity, gas, solid fuels, and liquid fuels are the most important.

Electricity is supplied to its recipients with the use of the national electricity system, which is
comprised of the following:

-  electricity generating devices;

-  transmission devices and networks;

-  distribution networks;

-  power stations;

-  devices which receive and convert electricity;

Analysis of the electricity sector infrastructure gives rise to concerns about its technical condition. Th e major weakness of the electricity system is the high voltage transmission lines (400 kV),
both in terms of their technical capacity and the lack of the network coverage in northern Poland.
Despite the fact that the transmission lines are on average 35 years old, their reliability looks good. Th e
technical condition of distribution networks is similar to that of the transmission networks; one of Th e
challenge, however, is the necessity to modernize and develop them in the context of connecting the
new power generation capacities.

Th e quality of the electricity networks and their security are verifi ed by natural weather conditions which pose a threat of system failure. Th e biggest failure of this type was the blackout in 2008
in the West Pomeranian Province, which was classifi ed as an event of extraordinary nature. In the
succeeding years, similar events unfolded in other provinces, but on a smaller scale. Th e high degree
of exploitation of the electricity infrastructure, however, contributes to its overload and aff ects its resistance to extraordinary factors and events. As a consequence, the risk that such failures will occur
more frequently increases.

Power generation facilities are located mainly in central and southern Poland. Most of them
were built decades ago and are characterized by low energy effi ciency. Th e uneven arrangement of
power generation capacities puts at risk the continuous power supply in northern regions of the country. Th e power is distributed via transmission networks, and the energy security of that part of Poland
depends of the quality of these networks.

Th e gas system infrastructure is operated by a transmission system operator – Gaz-System. Th e
company manages the transmission system comprised of more than 9.7 thousand km of high-pressure
gas pipelines, 15 compressor stations, 56 nodes, and 970 exit points.

Th e technical capacity of receipt points of imported natural gas (excluding its domestic production) to the transmission system allows for import of as much as nearly 18 billion cubic metres of
natural gas per year.

DIAGNOSIS OF THE STATE OF NATIONAL SECURITY

Aft er commissioning of the LNG terminal in Świnoujście, the transmission capacity will
increase by 5 billion cubic metres per year. Another increase in the receiving capacities is associated
with the launching of the so-called virtual and real reverse fl ow on the Yamal gas pipeline. It will allow
for importing gas from the West. Th e development of input capacities of the system is accompanied by
the extension and construction of new transmission networks.

**Infrastructural security institutions. Th e responsibility for continuous and eff ective function-**
ing of the infrastructure lies with the central and local government administration. Th e earliest legislation in this matter dating back to 1997 was the Act on Protection of Persons and Property, which defi ned the areas, facilities, equipment and transports of importance for national defence and economic
interests, public security and other essential interests of the state, which were required to be protected
by SUFO or proper technical protection.

All facilities listed in the register are protected on the basis of protection plans of such areas,
facilities and equipment, agreed upon with a competent
province police commissioner. **Th e Act of 26 April 2007 on Crisis**

for the protection of the state’s critical infrastructure. Th e
current system, however, has a number of defects, the most critical of which include:

-  the lack of factual criteria for the identifi cation of facilities of key importance for the security of
the state and its citizens (this does not concern the Act on crisis management). Fulfi lment of the
function indicated in the act or regulation does not always indicate the important role for security
of the state and its citizens. Th is leads to a signifi cant discretion in deciding which facilities should
be on the lists;

-  the focus on physical protection of facilities indicated in the act on protection of persons and property as well as in the regulation on facilities of particular importance for the security and defence
of the state and on their special protection;

-  the remarkable dispersion of responsibilities of specifi c authorities as regards the organization and
control of protection tasks;

-  the existence of a number of systems for protection of the critical infrastructure results in ineffi cient
utilization of the forces and resources, as well as frequent cases of misapplication of the regulations
and resulting obligations fulfi lled by persons responsible for the protection of these facilities;

-  the lack of real incentives from the state for owners of the critical infrastructure to invest in its safety;


-----

### WHITE BOOKTON NATIONAL SECURITY OF THE REPUBLIC OF POLAND

-  the lack of regulations which would enable effi cient collection of information on persons managing
the state’s critical infrastructure;

-  the lack of diff erence between the terms “the critical infrastructure of the state” and “the critical
infrastructure of a province, district, and commune”.

Violations of secured areas[9] show that despite strong legal regulations, the system of physical
protection of critical infrastructure facilities is not always eff ective.

**Th e geographic potential, the natural environment and agriculture. Poland is a country lo-**
cated in central Europe, along the east-west and north-south axes, which creates good conditions for
international cooperation. Th e country is also characterized by territorial compactness – its shape
resembles a circle, which is positive in defence terms.

Th e Polish state lies at the crossroads of transit routes, which is of key importance for economy.
It is a country with access to the Baltic Sea, owing to which it has an opportunity to diversify the raw
materials supplies by sea. Moreover, the Baltic Sea region has good climatic conditions for the development of wind power engineering. Poland has also its own natural resources, including hard coal,
lignite, copper and shale gas.

Poland is one of the poorest countries in Europe in terms of water resources. Th e current water
consumption generated mainly by the industry increase every year. Poland is also one of the most forested countries in the European Union (in 2010, forests covered more than 29 per cent of the country’s
area). Forests have the production (economic), environmental (protection) and social function. Th ey
are also strategic assets which shape the environmental security of the state – they stabilize the water
cycle in the environment, prevent fl oods, avalanches and landslides; shape the climate; increase the
accumulation of carbon; and even improve the health and living conditions of the population.

Poland is also a country with high environmental pollution (of atmosphere, water, soil, and
forests). As a result of numerous economic and social phenomena and, above all, political decisions,
the environment steadily deteriorated until the end of 1980s. Th e processes which took place in Poland aft er 1989, such as limiting the role of heavy industry, the growing environmental awareness and
Poland’s international commitments, reversed the negative trend. Nevertheless, there are still areas of
substantial environmental degradation on the Polish territory (e.g. areas of Upper Silesia).

At present, the nature conservation activities in Poland include the creation of national parks
(there are 23 such parks on the territory of Poland), nature reserves, landscape parks, and natural monuments as well as species protection. Since 2004, there is a new act on nature conservation in force
in Poland, which made it possible, inter alia, to join the EU Natura 2000 network, forming a comman
European system of environmental protection. In Poland, Natura 2000 covers a dozen or so per cent
of the country’s area, which helps improve the natural environment. On the other hand, it limits the
possibility of exploitation of natural resources and the development of infrastructure (including the
power infrastructure).

Th e potential of Polish agriculture, used through adequate investments and agro-technical development, ensures a stable situation in terms of food self-suffi ciency. Analysis of the fl ows of agricultural and processed products shows that Poland has a surplus of food production.

9 In July 2009 in Bełchatów, the Greenpeace activities entered the premises of the power station, climbed the cooling tower and
painted a slogan on it, reading: “Stop CO2.” In December 2008 in Konin, environmentalists broke into the power plant, climbed
a chimney, and began a protest against greenhouse gas emission.

DIAGNOSIS OF THE STATE OF NATIONAL SECURITY

One aspect indirectly related with food production is the use of the results of research carried
out in the BIO[10] category, which enable prevention or earlier detection of diseases that threaten the population. Besides its infl uence on public health, conducting such research and implementing its results
will help improve the innovativeness and, as a consequence, the competitiveness of food.

**Strategic reserves. At present, the strategic reserve system functions on the basis of the Act of**
29 October 2010 on Strategic Reserves. Th e act sets forth the principles for the creation, storage, sharing, liquidating, and fi nancing of strategic reserves, as well as determines the tasks and organization
of the Material Reserves Agency (Agencja Rezerw Materiałowych, ARM). Th e Agency is an executive
body, as defi ned in the Act on Public Finance, which carries out the state’s tasks relating to strategic
reserves and state stocks of crude oil and petroleum products. Th e regulations regarding the functioning and organization of the Agency are not basically diff erent from those adopted for other similar
entities – state legal persons.

A rational, effi cient, and transparent system of strategic reserves is to support the implementation of tasks in the fi eld of security and defence of the state, reconstruction of the critical infrastructure, mitigation of disturbances in the continuity of supplies serving the functioning of economy and
meeting the basic needs of citizens, saving life and health of citizens, as well as fulfi lling the international commitments of the Republic of Poland.

Th e most important system solutions include: the obligation to develop a government strategic
reserves programme which is adopted by the Council of Ministers; the principle that a proposal to
establish certain reserves must be preceded by an analysis of risks and uncertainties regarding threats,
for the fi ghting or prevention of which the reserves would be used; the introduction of one type of
reserves – the strategic reserves – without determining their specifi c range or amount; authorizing
one body – the Minister of Economy – to create, share, and liquidate the strategic reserves, as well as
allowing the possibility of maintaining strategic reserves which are not owned by the State Treasury.

Th e range and amount of strategic reserves is defi ned in the Government Strategic Reserves
Programme. Its main basis is the analysis of risks and uncertainties regarding threats to security and
defence of the state, safety, law and order, natural disasters and crisis situations, as well as the assessment of the economic and social situation of the state, and of the outlook for the world economy. Th e
programme is developed for the period of fi ve years and may be updated annually, if the conditions
under which it was developed have changed. Owing to this solution, the system is able to dynamically
respond to any change in security conditions. Moreover, the act provides a possibility to plan the budgetary funds to fi nance operations in the event of threats which could not have been foreseen and in
particular to fi nance the costs of making the reserves available in crisis situations.

Th e ARM can carry out its tasks on its own or entrust the storage of reserves to another entity,
with pay, on the basis of a storage agreement, the elements of which are defi ned in the act.

**Institutions responsible for planning economic support for security purposes. Planning of**
economic support for national security purposes is indirectly refl ected in a number of legal acts. It
concerns, inter alia, special acts, which form the basis for implementation of economically important
investments in the country. However, there is no single comprehensive regulation in this regard.

10 Research carried out in the fi eld of biology, ecology, medicine and agriculture – in accordance with the classifi cation of the
Innovative Economy Operational Programme.

### WHITE BOOKTON NATIONAL SECURITY OF THE REPUBLIC OF POLAND

Another problem is the lack of consistent policy of the state with regard to a broadly understood planning of economic support for national security purposes, including a clear defi nition of
responsibilities and tasks as well as the provision of appropriate powers and tools. Such a problem is
evident in the fi eld of energy security and in particular of the protection of the critical infrastructure,
where, on the one hand, the responsibility for energy security– according to the act – lies with the
minister, and, on the other hand, the powers and appointment of security offi cers – due to the owner
supervision – is in the hands of the minister of treasury.

Th is analysis of the Polish economic potential reveals its diverse infl uence on the shaping of
national security and the defi nition of national interests and strategic objectives. Th e development of
economy is a positive factor. Despite the current crisis, Poland has managed to maintain the growth of
its gross domestic product. Moderation in defi ning interests and strategic objectives, however, stems
from the condition of public fi nances resulting from the general imbalance of the fi nancial sector. Its
main causes are the public debt and defi cit in the public fi nance sector.

Ensuring energy security is another challenge for Poland. Th e shale gas resources provide an
opportunity in this regard. However, Poland is one of the poorest countries in Europe in terms of water
resources. Current water consumption rates (mainly in the industrial sector) grow year by year. Against this background, a positive element is forests, which are a strategic asset determining the environmental security. Th e condition of the infrastructure is unsatisfactory. Maintaining the necessary level
of food self-suffi ciency of the country, the bio-security of food products, as well as the drinking and
industrial water resources is another challenge which must be taken into account when determining
the national interest and strategic objectives in the fi eld of security.

Th e diagnosis of the Poland’s economic potential indicates that national interests and strategic
objectives in the fi eld of security should include the following: the improvement of innovativeness,
eff ectiveness and competitiveness of economy; ensuring the fi nancial stability of the country and its
energy security; and ensuring the environmental protection.

1.3. National interests and strategic objectives in the
fi eld of security

Th e events of the late 1980s and early 1990s led to signifi cant changes in the international
situation in Europe and in the world. As a consequence, Poland became a sovereign and democratic
country in constitutional and political terms. Its position was additionally strengthened aft er its accession to the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (1999) and the European Union (2004). Poland’s direct
surroundings witnessed some positive changes, too. Th e fact that Poland and Germany are members
of NATO and the EU, their close bilateral collaboration, including within the Weimar Triangle, and the
practical military cooperation (including between Poland, Denmark and Germany within the Multinational Corps Northeast), all they made it possible to fully normalise mutual relations, thus opening
up a new good-neighbourliness chapter. Slovakia’s and the Czech Republic’s memberships in the EU

DIAGNOSIS OF THE STATE OF NATIONAL SECURITY

and NATO as well as cooperation within the Visegrád Group have consolidated the rapports among
southern neighbours. Strengthening of Poland’s position through memberships in NATO and the EU
enabled to develop the partnership cooperation with Russia. In addition, Poland has consistently supported the existence of independent and sovereign Ukraine.

As a result, Poland’s security situation has greatly improved. A menace in the form of a large,
conventional confl ict in Central Europe is currently very unlikely. Poland’s territorial integrity is not
called into question, its constitutional system ensures democratic, political independence and internal
stability, and the economic development helps improve the quality of life of citizens.

A diagnosis of Poland’s potential is necessary in order to correctly defi ne its national interests
and strategic objectives in the fi eld of security. Th is constitutes the starting point for elaboration (taking into consideration the outlook for the development of external and internal security) of a comprehensive concept of the national security system, including the operational and preparatory options
of the system.

Th e starting point of the proposed catalogue of interests and objectives is a set of the constitutional interests, i.e. the fundamental functions of the Republic of Poland set forth in Article 5 of
the Constitution, which are as follows: the existence of the independent Polish state within inviolable
borders; the free and safe life of its citizens; the sustainable development of the societal and economic
potential of the state, with the constitutional emphasis placed on the issues of national heritage and the
protection of the environment.

Th e said functions correspond to the four spheres of the Republic of Poland as a national whole: the state as a political national organization; the citizens as a national community; the intangible
(spiritual) potential, an element of which is the historical heritage, including in particular the national
identity and culture; as well as the material potential built in the course of the social and economic
development, including the need of protecting the natural environment.

Th e constitutional interests can be specifi ed by referring to the two fundamental spheres of activity of any state, i.e. development and security. Consequently, two groups of national interests can be
identifi ed: the development interests and the security interests. Th is White Book analyses primarily the
national interests of the Republic of Poland in the fi eld of security, because the development interests
were the subject of analyses carried out as part of the government’s work on integrated development
strategies of the country.

In practice, there are two dimensions of the implementation of national interests in the fi eld of
security (as in the case of an entire security strategy): the operational dimension and the preparatory
dimension. In both cases, specifi c strategic objectives in the fi eld of security can be identifi ed.

**Consequently, in the wake of disaggregation of the constitutional interests, while taking**
**into account the above-mentioned procedure, a catalogue of the national interests and strategic**
**objectives in the fi eld of security was compiled, as presented in table 5.**

Th e catalogue can be termed a “constitutional catalogue”, as it was drawn up following an analysis of the state’s fundamental functions listed in Article 5 of the Constitution of the Republic of Poland
in the context of security.

It is also important to stress that as far as the typology of strategic objectives in the fi eld of security is concerned, two spheres of security can be additionally considered: the sphere of external relations
(external security) and the sphere of internal relations (internal security). What is more, two kinds of
activities supporting the national interests can be identifi ed within each of these spheres: strengthening
of all that contributes to security (positive relations with other entities, the state’s own strengths) and
combating all that undermines it (negative international phenomena and the state’s own weaknesses).
Th at is why, in more detailed analysis, an additional study of the following four types of strategic objectives in the fi eld of security might be helpful: promoting the positive in the international environment
and seizing the resulting opportunities; counteracting external risks and threats; reinforcing the country’s own strengths; and eliminating one’s own weaknesses.

-   *  *

Analysis of the process of shaping the national identity and statehood shows that the most critical factors were the following: creating the conditions for the development of the state, nation and
society which consolidate the historical heritage and national identity; providing adequate resources
and capabilities for the national security system; building and maintaining Poland’s strong position
internationally through consistent diplomatic activities, including integration ones (alliances).

Th e principles set forth in the constitution – of the democratic rule of law, upholding the principles of social justice, the protection of freedoms and rights of persons and citizens; the unitary nature
of the state; the supreme power (sovereignty) of the nation and political representation; separation and
balance among the public authorities; the decentralization of the state administration and local government as well as the function of ensuring security and inviolability of the state’s borders – all determine
the constitutional and political conditions of Poland and provide the framework for the formulation of
the catalogue of interests and strategic objectives in the fi eld of security.

Th e defence potential is systematically reinforced. Its key element is the fully professionalized
Polish Armed Forces which are being gradually modernized. Th is potential has a positive impact on the
level of Polish strategic ambitions.

Th e protection potential (services and guards) plays an important role in defi ning the national
interests and strategic objectives. It faces, however, a number of diffi cult challenges. Th ese include: the
broadly understood organized crime, terrorism (including cyber-terrorism) and illegal migration. Th e
excessive number of the services and dispersed supervision complicate the coordination and undermine the coherence of their operations.

Th e societal and economic potential of Poland aff ects the process of defi ning the national interests
and strategic objectives in the fi eld of security in various ways. Th e sustainable socio-economic development
of Poland ensures adequate resources and capabilities for the state’s security system. Th e development of
economy is a positive factor. Th e state of public fi nances, resulting from the general imbalance of the fi nancial
sector, has a restrictive impact. Th e country’s demographic situation may also have negative consequences.

Th e analysis of the above elements of Poland’s security potential made it possible to compile
a catalogue of national interests and strategic objectives in the fi eld of security. To the constitutional
national interests in the spheres such as: the state, citizen, and society, intangible resources and material
resources, relevant national security interests were assigned, within which, in turn, strategic (operational and preparatory) security objectives were identifi ed. Th e catalogue of the national interests and
strategic objectives in the fi eld of security provides the basis for discussions in subsequent chapters.

In this chapter, the present state of aff airs is presented as well as forecasts regarding the strategic
security environment in external (international) and internal (national) as well as military and non-military terms are outlined. Th e analysis comprises opportunities, challenges, risks and threats the
Republic of Poland will face during the next 20 years.

It is assumed that in the two decades to come, the conditions of external and internal security
of Poland shall evolve very dynamically, therefore forecasting should also refl ect the dynamic – and
sometimes diffi cult to predict – behaviour of actors of international relations in global and regional
dimensions, as well as the development of national factors. Consequently, this should allow to outline
possible scenarios of development of Poland’s security conditions.

2.1. Th e global dimension

Th e security of a nation on the international arena is a combination of its internal power and
capabilities that can be shaped depending on the possibilities and needs as well as the external factors
the infl uence of which can be modifi ed only to a limited extent.

**Eff ects of globalization. Globalization processes have yielded both positive and negative re-**
sults. On the one hand, they have enabled the global fl ows of thoughts, people, capital, technology, etc.
at an unprecedented scale. Th is had a positive impact on the acceleration of development processes
across the globe. On the other hand, this led to the dissemination of a wide range of negative phenomena. Internal political, economic and fi nancial crises, international terrorism, cyber-threats, organized
crime, corruption, traffi cking in human beings and drugs, money laundering, maritime piracy and
similar phenomena spread quickly across the globe from one region to another. Adaptation to globalization is uneven and entails turbulences in international relations.

### WHITE BOOKTON NATIONAL SECURITY OF THE REPUBLIC OF POLAND

Th e role of the state as the main player on the international arena is waning. Th is trend is
palpable all over the world. Th e regulatory role of the state towards external entities is being limited.
Th is phenomenon is benefi cial in some areas, as it stabilizes the situation through the voluntary
delegation of certain sovereign rights onto the international level. It increases the predictability of
states’ behaviour and off ers better opportunities of coordinating activities, and enforces the harmonization of the law (the condition of EU membership). However, states are now facing more serious
and more varied challenges stemming from the presence of powerful non-state players – supranational corporations, organized crime, terrorist organizations, and even private paramilitary companies. In unfavourable circumstances these organizations may, albeit to a varied degree – become
factors of instability.

**Th e changing role of main international actors. In recent years, the gradual constraining of**
the United States of America as a global superpower has become visible. However, the USA remains
a global military power. In the previous decade, the public debt of the USA soared, which was in part
the result of the wars in Afghanistan and Iraq, as well as the problems of the American economy:
high consumption levels, the low savings volume and ineff ective supervision of the banking system.
As a result, the United States is gradually falling out of the role of the “global policeman”. Th is means
that it is already necessary for the EU member states to increase their responsibility for security in
their direct strategic surroundings (operations in Libya in 2011 and in Mali in 2013).

However, one ought to bear in mind that the USA is still a highly innovative country characterized by a high level of entrepreneurship as well as dynamic and technical development. As the
country that issues the currency in which the vast majority of fi nancial reserves is held, the USA has
a very fl exible budget.

Just a few years ago, the European Union, as a whole, was perceived as the second global power.
Th e crises verifi ed this assessment. At the end of the previous decade the EU entered a phase of turbulences and attempts to structurally adjust to new challenges. the common currency was endangered,
and as a result the very existence of the Union in its current institutional shape was in question.

Th e probability that in the coming decades the position of the EU among other strategic
players will be weakened is relatively high. Currently, approximately 20 per cent of global GDP is
generated in Europe. In 2030, this share will, however, probably amount to ca. 10-15 per cent, while
in 2050, this share may fall to 5-10 per cent.

It ought to be underlined that the EU has become a stability factor in international relations
at the global level and a signifi cant normative force (international legislation). Th is situation should
be considered an auspicious opportunity for the future.

**Emerging powers. Th e increasing pluralism of the global correlation of forces stems mainly**
from the rapid growth of new powerful states whose signifi cance exceeds regional status. As a result,
for a few decades the focus of the global balance of powers has been shift ing from the Euro-Atlantic
area to the Pacifi c and Asia, which is a challenge for Europe. Th e change in the global confi guration
of powers is being brought about particularly by China, and – to a lesser extent – Brazil, India and
Russia[11] (the so-called BRIC group). Th e total economic potential of the latter three states is notably
weaker than that of the Chinese economy measured by purchasing power parity (PPP). Th e declared

11 Th e Russian Federation will be discussed in greater detail in the part dedicated to the regional dimension.

THE SECURITY ENVIRONMENT OUTLOOK

strategic partnership of Russia and China did not entail establishing a defence alliance; the “emerging superpowers” also failed to form lasting coalitions. At this stage, shift s in the balance of powers
do not give rise to armed confl icts, albeit clashes cannot be excluded in the future. In this aspect,
what attracts attention is the growing activity of China in the Far East, which Beijing considers to
be the Chinese zone of infl uence. Th is position of China might be exacerbated if the infl uence of
the military and nationalist groups increases in the Chinese authorities. Th e possible aggravation
of the economic situation, including social attitudes, might lead to the adoption of a nationalist
direction in foreign policy by the Chinese authorities. Th is would probably increase the frequency
of clashes between China and its neighbours, e.g. concerning the seas surrounding China. Th e relations between China and Taiwan, which are already very strong, are being tightened. Reintegration
with Taiwan would notably strengthen the geopolitical position of China (control of sea routes) as
well as their innovation, research and economic potential. Th is means, among other things, that one
cannot exclude the possibility of an escalation of the confl ict concerning Taiwan between Beijing
and Washington, which is the guarantor of Taiwan’s security.

Owing to the focus on economic aspects, the role of the military factor in the growth of the
Chinese superpower is not decisive at the moment. In the course of time, however, the constantly
rising Chinese military spending may have a signifi cant impact on the global correlation of forces.

Brazil is quickly climbing the ranking of states that count on the international arena. Specialists of the International Monetary Fund estimate that it will take fi ft h position in terms of GDP
already in 2015. In contrast to the remaining members of the BRIC group, Brazil devotes equal
attention to the development of the economy and political power, including the so-called soft power.

According to the World Bank’s GDP ranking, India takes the tenth place. In the opinion
of many economists, in the next twenty years India will become a leader of the global race for the
title of the largest world economy. Apart from economic expansion, India focuses on the development of its military potential (owing to the confl ict with Pakistan). Signifi cant purchases of military
equipment are accompanied by acquisitions of licensed technological lines for military equipment
assembly.

**Increased signifi cance of regional powers. Th e changes in the international balance of po-**
wers also cover a group of medium-sized states that has emerged and aspires to the role of regional
powers. Important non-European representatives of this group are as follows: Iran, Indonesia, Pakistan, South Africa, Turkey and Nigeria. In the context of emerging medium-sized powers, Turkey
(which is a NATO member and candidate for full EU membership) is of particular signifi cance for
the interests of Poland, as is, to a lesser extent, Iran.

Turkey holds the key strategic geographical place between Asia and Europe, and lies close to
North Africa. Economic outlooks of western research centres indicate that in the next 25 years, GDP
of Turkey, measured by PPP (which currently exceeds a trillion of US dollars), in the next quarter of a
century will rise faster than GDP of Russia, and much faster than GDP of the EU. As a result, in 2050,
the Turkish economy will be only slightly less powerful than that of Russia or Germany. In the coming
decades, Turkey will have the opportunity to join the group of highest-developed states in the world.

In the coming years, it is predicted that Turkey’s signifi cance will increase in the Middle East
and in North Africa, as well as in the post-Soviet area, especially in the Black Sea basin and in the


-----

### WHITE BOOKTON NATIONAL SECURITY OF THE REPUBLIC OF POLAND

South Caucasus and Central Asia. In the face of the increase in Muslim population in the former
Soviet space, this country will gain greater infl uence in the region.

Iran is an Islamic state with a notable and rising demographic potential accompanied by
increasing political ambitions. Its future is of importance for the process of shaping regional and
global security (the so-called Greater Middle East). In the Euro-Asian network of energy-related
interests, this state is important, as it holds immense oil resources (third place in the world, more
than 10 per cent of the market) and gas (second place in the world, approximately 15 per cent of the
market), whose sales and transit to Europe would have great impact on global energy relations. Th e
second reason for Iran’s signifi cance is of military character: acquisition of nuclear weapons by this
state and a possible armed confl ict resulting from this fact would have very serious consequences for
the confi guration of powers in the Greater Middle East, also on the global scale. If Iran gains the capacity to produce a nuclear device and obtains appropriate means for its delivery, one might assume
that the USA and Israel would not accept such a situation. It cannot be ruled out that Israel would
carry out armed operations (on its own or in cooperation with the USA) targeting Iranian nuclear
installations.

**Failed states. Th reats to international security are increasingly generated by the internal aff a-**
irs of states. Th is concerns especially the so-called failed states that are incapable of ensuring control
of their territory or guaranteeing the protection and security of their borders. As a result, they become a haven for fundamentalist terrorist organizations and organized crime. In times of globalization
and IT spread, the political message of these organizations and the actual tangible eff ects of their
activity can reach recipients anywhere across the globe immediately. Until 2001, Afghanistan was
an exemplary failed state. It was ruled by the Taliban regime that provided protection to training
camps of international terrorist organizations. Currently, there is growing concern that the Afghan
scenario might repeat itself in Mali and other Sahel states. In the perspective of the coming 20 years,
the phenomenon of so-called failed states will remain the most important concern of international
communities.

**Erosion of international agreements and organizations and the proliferation of weapons**
**of mass destruction. Th e changes in the global correlation of forces are accompanied by the erosion**
of most important international agreements. Th is process is becoming more and more apparent,
especially in the case of those accords that concern disarmament regimes based on the Treaty on
the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons (NPT), as well as disarmament treaties on: Conventional Armed Forces in Europe (CFE) and the Elimination of Intermediate-Range and Shorter-Range
Missiles (INF). Additionally, the international community has yet to ratify the Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty (CTBT) and the Fissile Material Cut-off Treaty (FMCT). More and more oft en,
the problems connected with proliferation and armaments are discussed at informal meetings and
produce informal arrangements, which is benefi cial in the short run, but does not eliminate the
impermanence and uncertainty related with these areas.

Th e growing proliferation of weapons of mass destruction can give rise to three “black scenarios”: “nuclear anarchy” resulting from a breakdown of the global non-proliferation regime based
on the NPT; the destabilization of a state that holds nuclear weapons; or the threat or use of nuclear
means by terrorists.


-----

THE SECURITY ENVIRONMENT OUTLOOK

Th e actions of Iran expose the weaknesses of the non-proliferation regime and the NPT itself.
It turns out that states might obtain threshold capacities in the area of nuclear weapons and at the
same time formally comply with the limitations imposed by treaties. Th e policy of Iran poses the risk
of a chain reaction in the region, where states one aft er another would display interest in acquiring
nuclear know-how and technology. North Korean nuclear tests also have negative regional and global
eff ects: on the one hand, they elicit the concern of neighbouring states and worsen regional security.
On the other hand, they challenge the NPT and undermine the perspective of ratifying the treaty on
the global and comprehensive ban on nuclear testing. Th e case of Iran shows that North Korea and
Pakistan might also be suppliers of technology and materials to other states interested in acquiring
nuclear weapons and means of their delivery contrary to the valid international agreements.

Th ere is also the danger that a country that possesses nuclear weapons and means of their
delivery would be destabilised. Pakistan is a good example here, as it has dozens of nuclear warheads (probably not installed and stored at various locations) and ballistic missiles capable of their
delivery. Uncertainty concerning the permanence of the ruling authorities and the loyalty towards
the power apparatus, special services as well as the army, combined with religious and political fundamentalism, the proximity of Afghanistan and Central Asia – all that raises concerns regarding the
security of the Pakistani arsenal.

One cannot also exclude the possibility of use or the threat to use (and blackmail is almost
equally dangerous as fulfi lment of the threat) nuclear weapons by terrorists, e.g. in a large urban
centre in the West. Such weapons can be either stolen or self-assembled; today, it is already
technically possible to use a conventional explosive to disperse radioactive materials (so-called dirty
bomb). Even if the number of victims is low and material losses negligent, the political, social and
psychological eff ects of such an attack would be immense. It is also worth noting that terrorists
might use biological weapons, e.g. to poison drinking water.

Th e regime of controlling conventional arms is gradually eroding. It has been signifi cantly
weakened, among other things, due to Russia’s non-fulfi lment of the commitments taken at the 1999
Istanbul summit, and because it aft erwards suspended the implementation of the CFE treaty. In the
perspective of the coming years, there is nothing indicative of Russia resuming the implementation of
treaty provisions. Th e breach of the culture of dialogue and cooperation in the area of arms control
is another issue.

What is particularly destabilising here is the proliferation of various missile systems. Th e
rapid development of missiles is characteristic mainly of unstable regions tormented by long-term
military and political crises. In the Middle East, Iran and Syria have developed systems capable of
targeting places located in Israel and American bases across the region. Combined with the nuclear
ambitions of Iran, this might elicit pre-emptive reactions by Israel and the United States.

Th e rivalry between India and Pakistan might have dangerous consequences, as both these
states possess nuclear weapons. In this nuclear arms race, India has initiated a new phase of confrontation by starting the development and construction of air- and sea-launched cruise missiles.

Poland pays special attention to the development of the missile systems of the Russian Federation. The situation is complicated by the non-transparent policy of Russia and the repeated


-----

### WHITE BOOKTON NATIONAL SECURITY OF THE REPUBLIC OF POLAND


threats of developing off ensive missile systems close
to Poland’s borders (Kaliningrad oblast) in response to
the construction of an allied (NATO) anti-missile defence system. Th e situation would rapidly deteriorate if
Russia withdrew from the INF treaty. Th e postulates of
some NATO members concerning the withdrawal of US
tactical nuclear weapons from Europe do not make the
situation any simpler. Such a withdrawal would be a US
strategic manoeuvre, while a similar decision taken by
Russia (pullout of tactical nuclear weapons to the Asian
part of Russia) would only be a tactical step. However,
owing to the strategic interests of the USA, it is hardly
likely that the Americans would withdraw their tactical
nuclear weapons in the foresee – able future.

International organizations that are concerned
with security and had until recently monitored compliance with these agreements are now changing their roles
and functions. It is becoming more and more apparent
that they do not adapt suffi ciently to the dynamic changes in the international environment.

Th e political and military functions (peace missions) of the United Nations have dwindled. Th e UN
Security Council has yet to be reformed, and the postulated changes would better refl ect today’s confi guration of powers. Th is is signifi cant, because the Security
Council formally remains the ultimate decision-making
platform that legitimizes the use of force (although force
is more and more oft en used without its mandate).

Th e functions of the UN, however, have increased
in the area of development and social issues. Th is very
type of activity seems to delineate the most probable direction of growth that common international organizations will adopt in the coming years.


**Charter of the United Nations signed**
**on 26 June 1945 in San Francisco**

**Article 39**
Th e Security Council shall determine
the existence of any threat to the peace,
breach of the peace, or act of aggression
and shall make recommendations, or
decide what measures shall be taken in
accordance with Articles 41 and 42, to
maintain or restore international peace
and security.

**Article 41**
Th e Security Council may decide
what measures not involving the use
of armed force are to be employed to
give eff ect to its decisions, and it may
call upon the Members of the United Nations to apply such measures.
Th ese may include complete or partial
interruption of economic relations
and of rail, sea, air, postal, telegraphic,
radio, and other means of communication, and the severance of diplomatic
relations.

**Article 42**
Should the Security Council consider
that measures provided for in Article 41
would be inadequate or have proved to
be inadequate, it may take such action
by air, sea, or land forces as may be
necessary to maintain or restore international peace and security.
Such action may include demonstrations, blockade, and other operations
by air, sea, or land forces of Members of
the United Nations.

THE SECURITY ENVIRONMENT OUTLOOK

Global challenges and transnational and asymmetric threats.

Security is constantly shaped anew while new challenges and threats appear. Th ey concern
not only particular political actors on the political scene, but also entire regions, continents and
civilization circles. Th ese phenomena will become more intense in the future. Although they are not
of military nature, they pose a threat to many sectors of public life and might disrupt the functioning
of states and organizations. Th reats of this sort, referred to as transnational and asymmetric, are
diffi cult to uproot, as – being of supranational, even global, nature – they are mainly not connected
with the existence of a specifi c state-perpetrator and specifi c territory. As a result, these negative
phenomena acquire a new dimension: the criminal activity that had been known for years escalates
as supranational organized crime, local terrorism becomes global terrorism that functions across
borders, and economic crises in one part of the world have a negative impact on the economy of
other, also far-off, regions.

Globalization and the information revolution impact the security environment by shaping
its new quality. On the one hand, it is characterized by growing interdependence and integration at
the level of states, nations and societies, and on the other hand, by increasing unpredictability and
uncertain further development. Th ough globalization and the information revolution yield great,
tangible advantages for the economy, communication and education, thanks to which these are
perceived as desired instruments and engines of change, still, they are accompanied by unfavourable phenomena that have a negative impact on safety and security. In the “globinfo” environment,
transformations connected with the appearance of new asymmetric threats, as well as the shift s in
the nature of the already existing ones, occur. Th e most important threats here are terrorism, cyber-threats and international organized crime. Governments have to face the additional challenge of
rising up to the phenomenon of cyber-protests, which are becoming an increasingly popular form
of expressing public disapproval.

**Terrorism. Although for the last few years the number of attacks has been falling, terrorism**
remains one of the main asymmetric and transnational threats to international and national security. It poses a risk to the lives of citizens, the stability of democratic institutions, infrastructure of
the state and other elements of its correct functioning. It is the tool for conducting radical political
or ideological warfare. Irrespective of the initial motivation of the perpetrators, and despite the enhancement of national counteracting mechanisms and systems and international initiatives aimed
at its combating, it will remain one of the main threats to the international community (fi g. 30).

Terrorism motivated by radical Islamic ideology is a particularly dangerous threat. In recent years, this type of terrorism has evolved from the activity of small regional organizations with
a hierarchical structure to the global jihad network (Al-Qaeda). Th is network is composed mainly
of autonomous cells functioning in various regions of the world, inspired by extremist ideology,
with the common strategic goal of destroying the western world and eradicating its non-material
symptoms. Th e expansion of global jihad will probably continue, and it will be characterized by the
application of increasingly refi ned methods and tactics that exploit the loopholes in the security
systems of states.

What is characteristic of the current and future terrorism of this type is the attempt to shift the
focus of its activity to the western world by intensifying the phenomenon of home-grown terrorism
(radicalization and performance of attacks by followers of Islam who are the second or further generation of migrants born in western states or converts to Islam), as well as the call for so-called individual
jihad, expressed by ideologists and organization leaders.

Terrorists will still mainly aim at shocking a given society by conducting spectacular attacks
that will cause as many victims as possible. However, smaller attacks might also be performed at
a larger scale, e.g. in the European countries, to destabilise order and keep up the feeling of insecurity
in societies.

Extremist terrorism, which has been reawakening recently, is a type of terrorism that diff ers
from the above-mentioned in terms of its basis and ideological motives, yet it brings about similar
eff ects. One can distinguish: extremely left ist, far-rightist, nationalist and separatist terrorism. It constitutes a threat also for the European countries, and it stems from, inter _alia, xenophobia, aversion to-_
wards immigrants, the economic crisis and the dissatisfaction of the society with the remedies adopted
by the governments. Most attacks of such groups are aimed at business and government targets. One
should expect that the number of such acts of terror will keep increasing in the future.

Previously marginalized far-rightist or nationalist movements will probably become an increasing threat to the stability of democratic states. Approaches negating the liberal concepts of multiculturalism and openness are becoming more and more popular. Th is leads to the formation of a dangerous new trend that employs terrorism as its method of conducting combat and manifesting radical
anti-immigrant and conservative views. Th is phenomenon applies not only to organizations, but also
to individuals (the “lone wolf” terrorists).

**Susceptibility to cyber-threats.** Th e susceptibility of states to cyber-threats, including terrorism-related cyber-risks, is growing. Th is is an upward trend, and it will systematically increase in
the future.


-----

THE SECURITY ENVIRONMENT OUTLOOK

Th e functioning of a modern economically-developed state is inextricably bound with
ensuring permanent and correctly functioning systems for data collection and transmission, as well
as monitoring and control systems. Cyber-aggression might also be employed by the authorities or
services of hostile states that are ready to engage in an information war, as well as big concerns, nongovernmental or supranational organizations, including criminal organizations, as well as groups of
activists, informal Internet users groups, and even individual users. As the experience of recent years
has shown, cyber-attacks might also have an ideological, political, religious and business background.
One cannot rule out that in the near future cyber-attacks, targeted mainly at critical infrastructure,
will become the tool for blackmailing by organized crime organizations. Th e fact that it is extremely
diffi cult to prove the perpetration of such an attack is conducive to the performance of such acts.
Technological development with its incredible dynamics will lead to the creation and promotion of
new attack techniques and methods, and the threats classifi ed as conventional will be refl ected by new
types of crime in the virtual world, e.g. as cyber-protests or cyber-demonstrations. Th e threats that
appear in virtual space will be more and more oft en classifi ed as situations that jeopardize national
safety and stability. In the future, cyber-attacks will probably be treated just like any act of breaching
the sovereignty of the state and its citizens. In the next two decades, such events and the responses to
them will be classed as conventional activity in the area of cyber-warfare and cyber-confl ict. Challenges may emerge regarding the necessity to take a political decision on whether to consider hostile
activity an attack against the state. Such a decision may shift the confl ict to a dimension other than
cyberspace.

Terrorist organizations are also active in virtual space. Until now, cyber-space was used to perform large-scale propaganda, training and recruitment activities, however one can now observe a new
type of threats and the trend to move purely terrorist activities to cyber-space (attacks aimed at information and communications technology networks and technological systems that are of strategic
importance for states). In the coming years, the signifi cance of the information environment and the
security of cyber-space will undoubtedly rise and become one of the top priorities in adjusting mechanisms ensuring international security.

In this situation, it is a great challenge for governments to
attempt to draw the line between personal freedom and the protection of individuals’ rights in the virtual world, and the means applied to ensure security.

Th e scale in which cyber-space, and especially online blogs
and social portals, might impact the security of states, was exemplifi ed during the “Arab Spring” that commenced in 2011: participants of the street events and protests, when they were shut off from
conventional mass media, eff ectively organized their activity via social networks such as Facebook and Twitter. Th is is most certainly
an upward trend that will become more apparent in the future, parallel to the dissemination of modern technologies among users.

### WHITE BOOKTON NATIONAL SECURITY OF THE REPUBLIC OF POLAND

**International organized crime and corruption. Th e globalization process also covers organ-**
ized crime and corruption. Illegal trading in drugs, high-gain goods and raw materials (gold, precious
stones, works of art, weapons and cigarettes), people (immigrants and “slave trade”) and their organs,
illegal cash fl ows (including money laundering), cyber-space (computer-aided fraud and forgery, extortion of information, theft and destruction of data and information, economic intelligence, breach
of copyrights, child pornography, gambling, etc.) are becoming the domain of supranational groups.
Some of them have at their disposal funds exceeding GDP of medium-sized states. Factors conducive
to their activity include the existence of migration diasporas and weak state structures, including especially those of so-called failed states. Th ese symptoms of crime are oft en linked to corruption. At
the international scale, it weakens, inter alia, transparency and stabilization, and contributes to the
appearance of crisis activities.

Th ere is a concern (which is highly likely to come true) that these phenomena will become
more intense in the coming years and will evolve in directions that are increasingly diffi cult to combat
by national and international police services, as the funds generated by criminal activity in one state
are located in legal enterprises registered in another country.

One may expect that in the perspective of next few years, criminal organizations, including the
terrorist ones, will increasingly frequently opt for opportunities off ered by the development of modern
technologies and globalization. Th e fi elds of criminal activity will not change noticeably; however,
technology will play a more and more important role in this regard. Th e combination of globalization
processes and the development of modern technologies in criminal activity will also expand opportunities for cooperation between various criminal groups, regardless of ethnic or cultural diff erences.
Th e functioning of unstable states and the existence of places and regions that constitute “hot spots”
with incapable administrative and ineff ective security bodies will also have impact on the international
criminal groups gaining in power.

In the global environment, for the most time security-related threats and challenges other than
conventional (military) ones are going to intensify in the coming decades. One of the most important
challenges are economic crisis phenomena. Th ey generate more and more problems connected with
state security. In terms of structural economic problems, the world and Europe are in a worse position
than during the fi rst decade of the current century. Numerous risks and destabilization factors have
accumulated, especially in the context of the shift in the global balance of powers: China and other
states with high economic growth are simultaneously the main creditors of the USA and Europe. Th e
deepening deregulation of fi nancial markets has led to a massive escalation of fi nancial speculation,
where a small group piles up gains, while wide social strata are pauperised.

Th e main destabilization factors involve:

-  Th e general slowdown of the economic growth rate, except for China, Brazil, India and several
other states;

-  the diffi cult debt write-off process;

-  fears regarding the possibility of the US fi scal defi cit slipping out of control;

-  disruptions of fi nancial systems (indebtedness) and turbulence in the real estate sector;

-  the growing unemployment, diffi cult access to loans;

-  the infl ation and drop in profi ts from investments;

-  rising prices of raw materials owing, among other things, to the multidimensional geostrategic uncertainty in the Middle East;


-----

THE SECURITY ENVIRONMENT OUTLOOK

-  the activities of some large banks and rating agencies that destabilize the monetary systems of some
states;

-  concerns about the fi nancial standing of some euro zone states (especially the Greek crisis).

Th ese problems lead, among other things, to the trust crisis among investors, and are conducive
to recession.

**Demographic changes. Th e geography of demographic changes across the globe gives rise to**
concerns. It is forecast that Earth’s population will reach 9 billion by 2050. Population growth will
almost entirely be generated by developing countries, the majority of which are incapable of providing their residents with food, housing, jobs, medical care, education and other basic living conditions. Th is entails the risk of uncontrolled migration to wealthier states, especially those in Europe
and North America. Th is risk grows during confl icts, which is troublesome for, among others, the
European Union, as became evident, e.g. during the crisis in the Arab world and the civil war in Libya
in 2011.

On the other hand, the developed countries have to cope with the ageing of their societies.
Despite insuffi cient labour force, these countries display xenophobic attitudes and reluctance towards
immigrants, who are considered to be a threat to national identity, and have exacerbated the crisis of
multiculturalism. Demographic changes, combined with other negative global developments, e.g. economic and fi nancial crises and climate changes, carry many potential risks, especially because existing
international structures are incapable of counteracting them.

**Climate changes. Challenges resulting from climate changes might result in disastrous con-**
sequences that we are not fully capable of specifying yet. Th ey also have growing infl uence on the
security of states, including Poland. Global warming is the remarkable change with long-term consequences. According to the data provided by the most representative group of specialists in this area,
the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, climate warming is undoubtedly taking place and
is refl ected by the increase in average air temperatures, water temperatures of seas and oceans, the
melting of glaciers and the raising average sea and ocean levels. Th is change results from the emission,
generated mainly by economic activity, and concentration of greenhouse gasses (GHG) in the atmosphere. Although scientists have yet to reach full agreement here, carbon dioxide plays a special role
in this process. One ought to underline that it is likely that the changes in climate “parameters”, such
as temperature, precipitation, geographical range of climate zones, will modify the security conditions
of social systems, as they will yield both direct threats, e.g. confl icts over water, and indirect risks, e.g.
migration and epidemics.

Long-term climate changes may entail epidemics – infections of people, animals and plants that
have previously not occurred in the given region or have seldom taken place. Th e instant spread of epidemics may also be enabled by various eff ects of globalization such as global transportation (especially
airborne) and world trade networks, the easiness of travelling, as well as temporary or permanent
migration. Such threats have until now been incidental, however, the phenomenon and related trends
require constant monitoring. Th e examples of “swine” and “bird” fl u show that such scenarios are all
the more possible.

Climate change is also opening up new opportunities which will become more and more possible in the future, e.g. development of the polar regionas in connection with natural resources and
transportation routes (new naval opportunities), especially in the Arctic. However, this will require
the development of a new formula for cooperation between the states bordering on this area and other


-----

### WHITE BOOKTON NATIONAL SECURITY OF THE REPUBLIC OF POLAND

players willing to sustain activity in this region, e.g. China. Owing to the frequently contrary interests
of these states, this will not be an easy process.

Once relatively inexpensive and accessible methods of extracting the raw materials that are
covered with the ice sheet are developed, it will become possible to temporarily solve the issues related
to the fact that humanity will reach the limit of further growth as forecast by scientists, which will be
the result of exploiting raw materials.

**Access to rare earth materials. Access to raw and energy materials that are especially rare in**
nature constitutes an important and constantly growing confl ict-generating factor in international relations. Rare earth metals currently used, among other things, to produce, among other things, a wide
range of modern industrial goods and so-called green technologies, are of special importance. Th e
short- and medium-term rivalry for ensuring raw material security, and mainly energy security, might
intensify every now and then, and the struggle may involve a threat or use of force.

Across the globe, many states depend on deliveries of raw materials, while other states have
almost monopolized[12] the extraction of certain fossil fuels. However, one may assume that in the long
run, the signifi cance of access to raw materials will decline parallel to the application of new technologies and technical progress. In the area of state security policy, what is gaining in importance is
such issues as diversifi cation of deliveries, alternative energy sources, protection of transmission lines,
transparency and stable functioning of the market and common energy system.

Military confl icts and crises

Apart from new non-military threats, one should also take into account the conventional risks,
i.e. internal and external military confl icts and crises. One may assume that in the foreseeable future,
the possibility of an eruption of a conventional confl ict on a global scale, with an epicentre in Europe,
is highly unlikely. However, due to globalization the potential challenges and threats to Poland’s security are determined not only by tensions on the European continent, but also by the appearance of
various confl ict centres beyond Europe.

**Political and societal changes in the Arab world. At the beginning of the second decade of**
this century, the political and societal turmoil in the Arab world, oft en referred to as “Arab Spring”
became a challenge for global security. Th e changes occurring in that part of the world took on the
character of either peaceful transformations (as in Tunisia and, to a lesser degree, Egypt), or open
confl icts. Th e military confl ict in Libya (where NATO launched operation “Unifi ed Protector” to protect civilians) and the long-lasting confl ict in Syria have had a particularly dramatic course. Th e latter
proved to be a diffi cult test of the eff ectiveness of the international community, especially in terms of
responsibility for civilians. It also has had a critical impact on the balance of regional powers, especially
on the infl uences of Russia and Iran.

Tensions in the Arab world bear the features of a long-term process, mainly complicated by
the diffi cult economic situation. Th e ties between that region and Europe are obvious: the continent is
inhabited by more than ten million Muslims from the Mediterranean Basin, and their population will

12 For instance, OPEC member countries produce about 40 per cent of the world’s crude oil, Russia provides 12 per cent, and
the USA – 10 per cent. In reference to rare earth elements, 95 per cent of their extraction is controlled by China, whose territory
holds approximately 35 per cent of global resources.

THE SECURITY ENVIRONMENT OUTLOOK

increase in the next decades. Th e indeterminacy of the political, social and economic changes in the
Arab world itself undermines the stability of Europe and Poland. It infl uences the position of many
Western European governments on the events taking place in this region.

For more than six decades, the Israeli-Palestinian confl ict has monopolised Europe’s attention,
with brief pauses for the recurring crisis in Lebanon fuelled by Syria and Iran, Egypt is suff ering from
the crisis following the fall of the regime of Hosni Mubarak, religion-based tensions between Christians and Muslims, and Muslims and Jews are recurring, there are also clashes within the Islamic community: between Shias and Sunnis. Th e Middle East region is also destabilised by the world power and
nuclear ambitions of Iran, terrorist attacks and proliferation of weapons of mass destruction.

**Th e Iran** **problem is a particularly important challenge that may bring about most serious**
consequences for global security. Th e international community have introduced economic sanctions
to stop Iran from obtaining nuclear weapons. Iran’s going nuclear would entail the spread of nuclear
weapons across the whole Middle East, as the neighbouring Arab states will also want to have nuclear
weapons of their own. If the world does not stop Iran, it will not be able to stop other countries of the
region. Th e Middle East, today’s global “powder keg”, would turn into a global “nuke”. If that happened,
the most critical challenge would be to fi nd a way out in the conditions of a nuclearized Middle East.
It would be the most serious global strategic dilemma of the following decades.

**Confl icts in South Asia. South Asia is a particular area, closely observed by the international**
community. Aft er the closure of the ISAF mission in 2014, Afghanistan will, for years to come, certainly remain the state that generates serious problems in terms of regional security. Th e achievements
of the international community in stabilizing Afghanistan are fragile, and it is not certain whether they
will be sustainable aft er 2014 without further international support.

Th e nuclear standstill between India and Pakistan limits the risk of a large-scale war, but the
confl ict in Kashmir may turn into a clash with global implications. In the worst-case scenario, the
outbreak of a war between India and Pakistan and exacerbation of the confrontation might entail
a confl ict between China and India, as Beijing disputes some sections of their common border.

**Th e Korean Peninsula. Th e Korean Peninsula is a similar hot spot in terms of the scale of po-**
tential threats (the menace of nuclear weapons use). Th e totalitarian regime of North Korea (DPRK)
has for many years been provoking armed incidents with South Korea. Th e immense risk grows as the
DPRK continues its acute and confrontation-seeking line of action, which may intensify these incidents and turn them into a larger military confl ict that would involve not only South Korea, but also
the United States and Japan. A decisive role in reducing the risks connected with North Korea’s policy
may be played by China.

-  * *

Th e global political scene is changing dynamically. As a result of the progressing globalization,
the regulatory functions of states have been weakened with non-state actors, taking advantage of these
developmends. Th is process will intensify, and will bear consequences especially in non-military security dimensions.


-----

### WHITE BOOKTON NATIONAL SECURITY OF THE REPUBLIC OF POLAND

As new powers rise, the states that previously unquestionably dominated decline slowly and
relatively. One might expect that especially China’s rise will have the most spectacular global impact.
Alongside the level of global security is falling with the weakening of the most important international
organizations and disarmament regimes. Th is negative trend will probably continue in the future.

Th e global situation might be termed “co-dependent instability”, as crises are being shift ed from
one region to another (sometimes very distant). In the globalized world, this trend will gain momentum.

2.2. Th e regional dimension

Th e territory of Europe, and especially its geopolitical and economic centre (the European
Union), is and will be the zone of internal stability towards which other states gravitate. However, military confl icts of limited range may arise on the peripheries of the EU (such as the 2008 Georgia-Russia
armed confl ict), which may alter the political situation and aff ect the security of the Republic of Poland. Both areas (the centre and the peripheries) are characterized by security asymmetry. While central states (including Poland) are linked by a vast network of international cooperation based mainly
on NATO and the EU (fi g. 31), peripheral states remain in the “grey security zone”.

THE SECURITY ENVIRONMENT OUTLOOK

Factors infl uencing Europe’s security environment

Currently, European security rests on a few, constantly evolving, co-related, albeit heterogeneous, components. Th e North Atlantic Alliance is undoubtedly the most important element here,
as it is capable of using “hard” force to guarantee the protection of its members. Importantly, NATO
strengthens the geopolitical ties between the USA and Europe and warrants American presence on the
European continent.

Aft er the end of the cold war confrontation, the Alliance successfully adapted itself to the
altered international reality. Th is was possible because the Alliance undertook to perform new tasks
(out-of-area missions), admitted new members and established and developed intense cooperation
with partners.

NATO is, and probably will remain, the most powerful and eff ective political and military alliance capable of successful deterrence and defence. Th is organization has redefi ned its tasks in the

objectives to its core mission: crisis management (cri

that boosts the deterrence capacity of the Alliance. Such actions should consist in making appropriate
investments by member states amounting to approximately 2 per cent of GDP, ensuring a balanced development of the NATO infrastructure in its member states, the consistent construction of the NATO
missile defence system, conducting joint military training, including training in scenarios of collective
defence, as well as regular preparation and updating of NATO contingency plans. Such activities will
enable buttressing the feeling of security in all NATO member states, including especially frontline
states, and contribute to increasing readiness to engage in out-of-area operations.

Th e **European Union** and its Common Security and Defence Policy (CSDP) constitute another fundamental element of European security. Th e CSDP has high value and potential for Poland.
However, the usefulness of the EU security policy for Poland depends on the progress in EU internal
integration and the intensifi cation of cooperation with NATO, as well as an EU coherent policy towards Russia. Unfortunately, these very issues elicit various opinions in the EU, and these diff erences
weaken the Union’s role in the fi eld of security.

Th e activity taken by individual Eurozone members, as well as EU institutions (e.g. the European Central Bank, ECB), helped increase the trust in the economies of EU member states. In these
circumstances, while at the beginning of 2012 a breakdown of the Eurozone seemed quite likely, this
issue now appears to be outdated, which is signifi cant in the context of Poland’s possible introduction
of the common currency.

THE SECURITY ENVIRONMENT OUTLOOK

From Poland’s perspective, deepening European integration in the security zone is desired as an
element that boosts the European capacity to act in emergency situations.

One of the signifi cant problems in the area of EU security is the 2003 European Security Strategy, which is to a large extent outdated. Its revision is necessary to strengthen EU security tools and
mechanisms.

Th e further strengthening of the CSDP will be dependent on both the political will of EU member states and the development of institutions, building capabilities and active operational involvement
of the EU in its neighbourhood. Th e development of European military capabilities may be enhanced
mainly by the pooling-and-sharing initiative, the adaptation of the EU battle groups to actual operational needs by increasing the possibilities of their use, establishing a permanent EU planning and
command structure at the operational level, deepening
relations with the Eastern Partnership states in the area of
security policy and developing the practical dimension of **Declaration on Strategic Coope-**

Any radical reduction in of American interest in Europe could have particularly dramatic effects if Europe itself disintegrated at the same time. A Europe of internal divisions, a Europe of free
struggle of competing interests of particular superpowers, is the real source of most dangerous confl icts. Th e history of the 19[th] century, and especially of the 20[th] century – the century of two world wars,
is indicative of this. In both cases, it was not until the USA intervened that the hostilities were brought
to an end. Without the USA, the divided Europe could not function. Th at is why today, in the face of
the objective reduction of the strategic presence of the USA in Europe in favour of its presence in the
Asia–Pacifi c region, the safe future of Europe depends on the pace and depth of integration in the Old
World. If, for example, the United States of Europe were established, the risk of confl icts resembling the
wars of the 20[th] century could be completely eliminated. However, if Europe fails to integrate, this risk
will most certainly increase. Nowadays, it is hard to predict which tendency will prevail.

Currently, **Russia** is incapable of regaining the position it held in the Soviet era, neither in
Europe nor on the global scale. Th e basic ambition of Russia is to play the role of one of the main and
crucial global centres, including the European continent, as the US presence declines.

Th e Russian economic system is evaluated by experts as ineff ective and uncompetitive, with
raw materials dominating over modern technology (the economy is principally based on raw material
exports). Additionally, the demographic structure of the Russian society is unfavourable.

Th e Russian Federation has signifi cant potential of natural resources; Russia is also the sixth
economy in the world (GDP measured by PPP), with the outlook to advance in the coming years by
one or two ranks. Russia is also a permanent member of the UN Security Council. In military terms,
owing to its notable nuclear capacity, it remains a global superpower. It then will continue to impact
global and regional strategic relations.

Th e future of Russia is diffi cult to foresee. It is dependent on the approach of its authorities to
the problems of modernising the economy, adapting state structures and the society to the new reality.
Th is indeterminacy is and will long remain the main source of uncertainty among its direct neighbours. Especially that Russia, by availing itself of the good economic situation on the energy resources,
is continuing the large-scale programme of modernizing its armed forces that was launched in 2008.
Th is process, however, is not fully transparent, owing to the fact that Russia suspended the implementation of the CFE treaty provisions at the end of 2007.

Perspectives for the extraction of shale gas by some European states may weaken the hegemonic position of Russia in the area of natural gas. However, irrespective of unfavourable conditions,
Russia has signifi cant development potential, which – on condition that appropriate mobilization is
ensured – may yield positive results.

Th e security of Poland to a large extent depends on the development of relations between
Russia and the West. Today, it is diffi cult to foresee clearly how they will develop in the future. Will
Russia maintain its policy aimed at strengthening its position as a superpower, without taking into
consideration others, especially neighbouring states, or will seek to develop at their expense? Or will
it switch to cooperating on collective security? Nowadays, unfortunately the former scenario seems
more probable, and this scenario is unfavourable for Poland. Th is is also the reason why Russia is
carefully examined by NATO states which are, on the one hand, open to cooperation, and, on the other
hand, cautious, as Russian strategic documents still stipulate that NATO is Russia’s potential enemy.

THE SECURITY ENVIRONMENT OUTLOOK

Th e infl uence of Russia in the post-Soviet area has relatively weakened. However, in recent
years one may speak of Russia’s increasing infl uence in some countries, especially those that adjoin
Poland (Belarus, and to a certain extent – Ukraine). Indicative of this trend is that Ukraine’s attempts
to draw its foreign and security policy closer to the West have become feebler. It is quite likely that in
the next few decades Ukraine will remain in the buff er zone between the EU and Russia, seeking to
steer a middle course between the two centres of power.

Th e above-mentioned elements of European security remain cooperatively intertwined with
various intensity and help maintain a relatively stable order by mitigating crises and confl icts and
preserving democratic standards in Europe internally and externally.

When discussing the European security system, one cannot disregard the Organization for
**Security** **and** **Co-operation in Europe (OSCE). Th e OSCE focuses its activity on the territory of Europe,**
in the broad sense, and especially on the territory of the former Soviet Union. Th e OSCE’s capacity
has severely been limited in the past few years. Th is is mainly the outcome of the policy pursued by
Russia. Th e OSCE is experiencing diffi culties when engaging in activity in post-Soviet states, especially
relative to the so-called frozen confl icts. Also other states, discerning the marginalization of the OSCE,
limit their involvement in this organization’s activity.

Nevertheless, the OSCE still has an important role to play in the strengthening of security in
Europe, especially in the context of the common goal specifi ed in 2010 at the OSCE summit in Astana.
Th e OSCE adopted a common vision of a Euro-Atlantic and Eurasian security community rooted in
agreed principles, shared commitments and common goals. Treaty-based arms control systems and
military confi dence- and security-building measures, including “open skies”, activity in the area of the
“third basket” (the human dimension), as well as the work of the Confl ict Prevention Centre are also of
importance. Moreover, its Central European and Central Asian activity range provide the opportunity
for democratization and strengthening security in the OSCE area.

Hotbeds of tensions and confl icts in Europe

In security terms, Poland’s position is unfavourable, as it is located in the vicinity of the most
important European centres of potential and actual confl icts. In the region of the Black Sea and the
Caspian Sea there are four frozen confl icts (Abkhazia, South Ossetia, Nagorno-Karabakh and Transnistria). Sometimes these confl icts get “defrosted” and enter a vehement phase, as in the case of the 2008
Georgian-Russian war. Another factor is the separatist trends and ethnic and religion-related tensions
in Eastern Europe (the North Caucasus), as well as in Western Europe (Spain and Northern Ireland).

Poland also shares a border with the Kaliningrad oblast – the most heavily militarised area in
Europe – and with Belarus, which is ruled by an authoritarian regime.

Th e Balkan region, aft er a series of wars and confl icts, is slowly and gradually restoring stability.
Th e best prepared states of the region joined NATO and the EU. However, owing to the persisting
sources of tensions in Bosnia and Herzegovina and Kosovo, it is necessary to retain international (also
military) forces there to support the stabilization and post-confl ict reconstruction process.

Direct military threats to Poland

Considering the whole spectrum of strategic security conditions, Poland must take into account the necessity to stand up to military threats. Th ese might be of twofold nature: threats related to
political and military crises, and war threats. Th e former involve international entities employing the
military factor to exert strategic pressure as part of their current, day-to-day policy without crossing
the threshold of a war. Th e latter is formed by the occurrence of an actual armed confl ict.

Strategic military pressure may assume the form of:

-  developing military capacity in sudden leaps that disrupt the existing balance of forces;

-  demonstrating power in the form of military exercises;

-  blackmailing via a threat of an armed confl ict.

An actual armed confl ict may be the consequence of an uncontrolled escalation of a crisis situation. In the foreseeable future, two types of such confl icts can be discerned:

- First, confl icts that can most generally be referred to as aterritorial (where the adversary does not
intend to occupy the attacked territory), i.e. targeted strikes of purposefully moderate scale and
range (including covert strikes with “alleged responsibility”), aimed at forcing the attacked state to
take political action in the circumstances of isolation from a larger international security system,
e.g. without setting in motion a NATO operation in consensus-challenging situations;

- Second, confl icts connected with a situation that is less likely nowadays, but at the same time most
dangerous, i.e. a large-scale war. However, such a war could occur aft er a previous radicalization of
the current course of international politics. It would be preceded by a rather long-standing process
involving unfavourable political and strategic changes across the globe that would lead to an escalating acute crisis situation. As a result, there would be enough time to prepare a response, as well as
a collective reaction of the entire Alliance, of which Poland is the member.

-  * *

Europe remains the area the centre of which (the European Union and the European NATO
member states) is characterized by a high level of stability that results from the embedded integration
ties embracing all possible areas. Overcoming of the economic and fi nancial crisis in the EU (which
seems a foregone conclusion) will confi rm the role and signifi cance of the EU also in the future. Th e
peripheral areas of Europe, however, are rather prone to crises which are mostly “frozen” confl icts, but
sometimes evolve into open clashes.

2.3. Th e national dimension

Conditions of security in the areas of defence and protection

**Internal (national) arms-related challenges. While assessing and forecasting the national se-**
curity conditions, one should, to start with, exclude with regard to the military dimension the existence of an internal military threat (rebellion, coup). However, there is a risk that organized armed
crime will escalate, especially when it comes to transnational crime (crimes committed with the use of

weapons on a larger scale). Also, it cannot be totally excluded that paramilitary or domestic terrorist
groups will emerge, thus enforcing adoption of protection measures.

Article 228 para. 1 of the Constitution of the Republic of Poland stipulates that in situations of
particular danger, when ordinary constitutional measures are insuffi cient, any of the following appropriate extraordinary measures may be introduced: martial law, a state of emergency or a state of natural
disaster. It makes it possible to involve armed forces into various activities in order to support internal
security and provide help to the society. In turn, the Act on the General Obligation to Defend the Republic of Poland imposes the obligation of participation

uncontrolled, mass migration into the territory of the Republic of Poland.

**Espionage. Th e information resource is one of the most signifi cant assets a modern state has**
at its disposal. It has direct infl uence not only on the political (including politico-military) condition
of a state, but also on the manner it operates in the socio-economic fi eld. Th e traditionally understood
intelligence activities is a process of obtaining, processing, analysing, and distributing information to
help policy-makers in taking key decisions. Any breach of national security by foreign special services
both when a foreign country obtains specifi c data as the integrity of information systems, including
ICT systems, is breached, may result in serious dangers.

Along with the growing signifi cance of information in the context of the state’s functioning, security threats in this fi eld shall get bigger, too. In traditional terms, such threats are generated
by states that conduct strategic intelligence activities. One should also take into account information
diversion, or activities of foreign special services with an aim of infl uencing individual behaviour (of
policy-makers in critical posts) and also civil behaviour, conducted both in the virtual and real world.
E.g., there are hypotheses that interpret the particular force and range of
demonstrated opposition against extraction of shale gas, which would
put in danger producers who use energy sources hitherto available, as
the result of such activities. Th is issue also involves disinformation activity, oft en aimed at provoking desired social and political reactions.

A threat that is particularly important when it comes to the actions of Poland in international organizations, may be activity aimed
at obtaining access to negotiation positions (negotiation instructions)
for Polish representatives during the debates.

However, states are not the sole entities that conduct intelligence (espionage). Terrorist organizations, for instance, also effi ciently use various methods of gathering information in order to create


-----

### WHITE BOOKTON NATIONAL SECURITY OF THE REPUBLIC OF POLAND

a danger to the state. Th erefore, threats connected with espionage by non-state entities will constitute
an accruing category of threats.

It should be also stressed that simultaneously with the growing signifi cance of non-state entities, espionage has also encroached the private sector. Such notions emerged as economic intelligence
or industrial espionage which relate to gathering knowledge of business competition and production
operations. Such dangers, which are connected with the growing signifi cance of the private sector
not only in the fi eld of economy, but also in relation to the progressing “privatization of security”, will
constitute a serious challenge in the years to come.

Technological progress and computerization era, in turn, also enabled intelligence activities
to penetrate the cyberspace. Cyber-espionage, as well as diversion and sabotage activities in the cyberspace may in the years to come turn out to be a serious threat generated by foreign special services. Technological progress of audio-visual monitoring tools, including the far-ranging ones, causes
that in response to challenges in the context of protection of state interests the following intelligence
approaches will be employed:

- Measurements and Signatures Intelligence, MASINT, i.e. intelligence information of scientifi c and
technical nature obtained through qualitative and quantitative data analyses (metrical, angular, spatial, wave-length, time dependence, modulation, hydromagnetic) on the basis of data originating
from advanced technical sensors;

- Signals Intelligence, SIGINT, i.e. information originating from communication, electronic or radio
intelligence, singularly or in combination;

- Imagery Intelligence, IMINT, i.e. information coming from the use of photography, infrared sensors,
lasers, electro-optics and radars, where images of facilities are optically or electronically reproduced
in a fi lm, electronic imaging devices and other media.

**Crime and other threats to public security. Stabilization and security in Poland depend to**
a large extent on the crime rate, and organized crime in particular, as the latter is interlinked in a corruptive manner, internally and externally. Owing to globalization processes, these threats acquired
cross-border dimensions. It may be predicted that evolving organized groups that engage in economic
crime on a large scale and launder funds coming from their activity, will constitute one of the biggest
non-military threats to the functioning of a democratic country.

Aft er the period of the mid-90s of the past century and the beginning of the current century
when large criminal groups characterized by high levels of organization and hierarchy dominated
in Poland, numerous smaller groups have recently come into being, oft en loosely connected among
themselves and collaborating. Such a decentralized structure makes it signifi cantly more diffi cult to
liquidate whole organizations. In recent years, the involvement of persons originating from circles of
sports pseudo-fans in activities of organized criminal groups has been noted. Also, a phenomenon of
international criminal groups acting in Poland is noticeable. It seems that such a trend will go on in
the next years.

Smaller, mobile criminal groups involved in a broad spectrum of illegal activities, undertaking
short-term cooperation with other such organizations, domestically and internationally, will constitute a source of varied threats to Poland’s security.

Organized crime in Poland is weaker than in many other European countries due to the effi ciency of the Polish police, which cooperate more and more closely with police structures of other
Union countries. Nevertheless, open borders within the Schengen Area and a long external border of


-----

THE SECURITY ENVIRONMENT OUTLOOK

the EU makes it likely that threats to Poland’s security caused by organized crime will continue also in
the foreseeable future.

In the fi eld of drug crimes, Poland – as a result of its geographical situation – is both a transit
country as well as a target market. At the same time, it is necessary to take into account that Polish
criminal structures participate in the illegal practice of large-scale production of synthetic narcotics. Th e
production is directed both to the internal market and smuggled to European countries. In this context, it is necessary to draw attention to the phenomenon of illegal cultivation of cannabis, whereby the
perpetrators oft en use specialist equipment in closed cultivation systems. As far as of drug threats, are
concerned, one should expect in the years to come a further growth in production of synthetics; nevertheless there still be a substantial danger connected with smuggling of cocaine from South America, and
heroine from Asia, and consequently, the risk that smuggling channels from these locations to Europe
will remain active.

On the basis of statistical data of the law enforcement authorities, it is possible to indicate a certain trend in criminal group activities in last years. Indeed, there was a shift from the activity in the
fi eld of criminal off ences towards economic crimes, and those to the detriment of the State Treasury, in
particular. In this scope, one may assume that organized groups will get involved in defrauding funds
coming from grants and subsidies as well as support and structural funds from the EU. Also, one can
assume that criminal organizations operating in Poland, just like international criminal structures,
will use state-of-the-art technologies for the purposes of their activity, and, along with technological
advancement, this tendency will accrue.

With regard to organized economic crime, the most common off ences are defraudment or
unlawful reductions in the scope of VAT and excise tax (smuggling, illegal production and turnover
of alcohol, tobacco products and fuels). Illegally obtained funds are then subject to the process of socalled laundering and deposited both at home as well as abroad. Th ey are used, among other things,
for the purposes of purchase of real estates, securities, luxury commodities, works of art; they are also
invested in legal economic undertakings. A growth in criminal activity on the capital market is being
witnessed. Also criminals gain profi ts from production, smuggling, and trading in goods protected by
copyrights or patents. It is estimated that in the globalizing world, economic crime will show intensifying tendency.

Criminal off ences, including also so-called common crimes, includes fi rst of all: homicides,
scrimmages, beatings, causing detriment to health, rapes, robberies, theft s, burglaries and damages
to property. One should bear in mind that many of those crimes are committed in connection with
organized crime activity. With regard to criminal practice, owing to changing trends in activities of
perpetrators and their increasing focus primarily on the economic sphere, one may assume a drop in
crime rates for such types of crimes. Th e eff ects of economic downturn, economic instability or high
unemployment may temporarily negatively infl uence trends in the considered realm (it is confi rmed
by a slight increase in the number of off ences, observed since 2009, aft er a period of several years of
a distinct downward tendency).

What is worth stressing in this context is the increasing general crime detection rate. Restoration of decreasing tendency in the number of off ences and maintaining the growth of the detection
rate is conditioned by effi cient cooperation of individual entities responsible for combating crime with
the society, and also active implementation of preventative measures, including those instituted by
non-governmental agencies. Of considerable signifi cance is also education for security.


-----

### WHITE BOOKTON NATIONAL SECURITY OF THE REPUBLIC OF POLAND

An important element of general security is road traffi c security. Main reasons for traffi c
dangers in Poland are irresponsible behaviours of traffi c participants and the low quality of the road
infrastructure, resulting in large numbers of casualties. Road traffi c security depends mostly on effi cient systems of monitoring behaviours of traffi c participants, on social awareness and discipline,
general education in the road security realm, the road infrastructure condition, technical condition
of vehicles, and the condition and quality of road traffi c control and supervision. It should be assumed that eff ective actions in the aforesaid fi elds, primarily inclusive of the planned build-up of
modern road infrastructure in the next years, will help decrease the number of traffi c accidents and
road casualties.

Another test of law and order is the number of collective disruptions thereof, which has been
decreasing in recent years, especially during organized mass events. However, what is worth noting
is the phenomenon of slow increase, in recent years, in the collective law abuses in the course of public assemblies, public protests, strikes, and blockages. As in the case of criminal off ences, the number of such events may be infl uenced by economic factors, high unemployment or public discontent.

**Natural disasters. An inseparable element that shapes the internal security of Poland will**
be challenges related to disasters caused by the man or natural catastrophes. Human activity, which
remains high and even grows systematically in many fi elds of activity – oft en burdened with high
risks – (e.g. power engineering, extracting industry, environmental interferences), will obviously increase the risk of occurrence of events with disastrous eff ects for property, health and life of
people.

Similar is the case for disasters caused by natural factors, such as heavy rainfalls or violent
windstorms, hurricanes and whirlwinds. Climatic conditions and changes will result in ever more
frequent violent weather phenomena in the climatic area, in which Poland is located. One of the
most serious challenges to the internal security of the country will be extensive fl oods. Th eir frequency may grow in a ten- to fi ve-year cycle, which – given defi ciencies of the protection infrastructure – would cause the losses of the state and its citizens even more severe.

Social conditions of security

**National identity and cultural heritage. National heritage is an important element of life**
and activity of nations and the society as well as individual citizens. It is a result of a multi-century
process and consists of tangible as well as intangible accomplishments of the past generations. At
the same time it determines the identity of the contemporary nations that, as the community linked
with ethnical and cultural and civilization bonds, are characterized by a sense of separate identity
and the capability of transmitting it to next generations.

Th e globalization processes which are now making their way, inclusive of the integration of
European Union states, lead to the tightening of relations between individual countries in economic, legal, social and political terms. Such situation creates conditions for diff usion and unifi cation
of cultures.

Th erefore, a challenge for the identity of nations and their cultural heritage, also in Poland,
may be the expansion of a uniformed mass culture which is an element of the globalization process.

### WHITE BOOKTON NATIONAL SECURITY OF THE REPUBLIC OF POLAND

Diff usion and mixing of various nationalities and cultures lead naturally to underrating of the signifi cance of tradition and to reassessing of values, ideals or principles observed so far in a given
society. In the long run it may lead to disintegration processes.

**Social conditions. Economic condition of a country translates directly into its social condi-**
tions, structure of the society, and living conditions of the population. A natural consequence of the
economic cycle when it deteriorates is a growing unemployment and limitation of opportunities to
realise one’s own initiatives and professional development. In a longer run, such situation may cause
growing despondency and impoverishment of the society, build-up of the group of those excluded,
intensifi cation of radical and extreme views, and, as a result, social discontent and unrest. People
who lack suffi cient means to satisfy their basic needs are automatically subject to marginalization,
and children that are brought up in such conditions have poor chances to change their situation.
Th erefore, an important thing in social support is to place an emphasis on helping the family, as it is
fi rst of all an investment in the young generation, which – instead of being a possible threat – may
constitute future human capital and support national economy.

**Demography. All scenarios forecast an unavoidable decrease in the population count and an**
accelerating process of ageing of the Polish society. An Eurostat demographic forecast indicates that
in 2060, every third Pole will be retired, and Poland will be on the fi rst position in Europe in terms
of the percentage of people above 65 years of age. It is also estimated that Poland’s population shall
drop from 38 million to 31 million (fi g. 32)[14]. Th e estimate was prepared only on the basis of results
related to the number of births and deaths, without taking into account the so-called aft er-accession
outfl ow of Poles, namely their economic emigration to EU countries.

Also disturbing are demographic forecasts prepared by the Chief Statistical Offi ce. Th ey indicate that Poland’s population will decrease systematically; the fi rst years will bring about a slight
decrease (by approximately 10 thousand per year); however, aft er 2015, the demographic decline in
Poland will accelerate, and the Polish population in 2020 will be fewer by nearly 200 thousand than
in 2015.

Th e Polish demographic structure will deteriorate; fi rst of all the process of ageing of the
society will gather momentum. In 2035, the number of people in post-working age will amount to
approximately 9.6 million and will constitute 26.7 per cent of Poland’s population in general[15]. Th e
shortage of people of working age will amount in 2035 to as many as 3.8 million people. Th e number
of people aged under 18 will be lower by 2035 by ca. 2 million, so they will account for only 15.6
per cent of general population. Th erefore, the demographic dependency ratio for people of post-working age in relation to people of working age will go up from 55 in 2007 to 74 in 2035.[16] (fi g. 33).

Th e demographic decline and the ageing of the population will have an adverse eff ect on the
labour market and the pension system. Th is may call into question Poland’s ability to continue civilizational development at a fast rate. To put it in other words: weakening of the demographic safety of
a country will also negatively aff ect its internal and external security.


-----

### WHITE BOOKTON NATIONAL SECURITY OF THE REPUBLIC OF POLAND

Th e most painful eff ect of the diffi cult demographic situation of Poland may be a crisis of the
pension system and of the state fi nance system. Studies indicate that in countries of the Organization
of Economic Cooperation and Development, approximately half of the public debt is generated by the
pension system. Th erefore, it requires an adequate and eff ectively implemented reform.

Th e declining and ageing society will increase the demand for labour force from other countries, although it may be alleviated by the increase in labour effi ciency by technical progress, by
extending the employment period and by increasing the fertility rate. In the years to come, social and
cultural factors connected with the infl ow of large groups of immigrants would be of importance for
possible changes in the security environment. As the most favourable solution, Poland would remain
a coherent society in which new citizens would be integrated with the rest. Otherwise, an ominous
phenomenon of immigrant ghettos on the one hand, and the intensifi cation of xenophobic attitudes
and antipathy to the newcomers on the other, would occur.

**Social capital. Th e period of the systemic transformation, which took place in Poland aft er**
1989, caused numerous changes in the social structure. New social groups emerged, such as the middle
class, entrepreneurs and persons permanently unemployed or with extremely low income. At the same
time, the diversifi cation of income levels in the society signifi cantly deepened. Th e degree of concentration of incomes is systematically rising: the gap between salaries of the wealthiest 10 per cent and
the poorest 10 per cent of people is widening, indicating the strong intensifi cation of social stratifi cation. Th e correlation between the level of education and the professional position is getting lower; in
result of expansive development of higher education and a growing number of high school graduates,
the market value of education is decreasing. Th ese are phenomena which – should no activities aimed
at elimination thereof be adopted – shall cause material social perturbations in the future.

Surveys of public opinion point, inter alia, to the lack of trust in state institutions. Th e latter are
still sometimes perceived as a hostile bureaucracy and not structures serving the society. A signifi cant
role in the unfavourable perception of state institutions, and the consequential perception of corruption, is played by the historical and cultural factor. Th e aversion to cooperation with state bodies is
rooted in the society in the same way as the fear connected with revealing crime perpetrators, the
shame associated with snitching, and even sometimes the conviction that to cheat “them” (i.e. authorities understood as alien to society) is something of merit. Such attitudes are not only a factor that
determines social connivance to corruptive behaviours, but also to antisocial, hooligan and criminal
activities (in particular towards property). Th ey bring negative infl uence to bear on the economy and
its functioning.

Th e issue of attitude to the state should be raised in a broader context of the low level of trust in
interpersonal relationships in the Polish society. In the case of Poland, this indicator is among the lowest
in Europe. It has a negative infl uence on the development of social bonds and weakens the thinking in
categories of the common good. Among Poles, owing, inter alia, to the high unemployment rate among
the youngest and the oldest citizens’ groups of working age, the phenomenon of economic stratifi cation
and the accompanying sense of frustration, social injustice, rejection, lack of fulfi lment of expectations
and ambitions and the incapability of achieving one’s aims, grow systematically. Such feelings may be
sometimes accompanied by aggressive and destructive behaviours that disavow the social order. What
should be considered particularly dangerous is the intensifi cation of individual attitudes and civil movements of distinctly extremist character. It may lead to an erosion of the public order, the legal system and
the system of values. Such situations call for adopting of adequate measures on the part of the authorities,

because the incorrectly managed, negative social energy may be utilised by forces unfriendly or even
hostile to the state. Directing – for example from the outside – the emotions of frustrated and excluded
strata of the society may pose a material danger for economic stabilization, and thus for the state security.

Th e catalogue of negative social phenomena, which should be addressed in an interventional
manner, is long: emigration of the young generation; lack of eff ective pro-family policy; the sense of
helplessness in confrontation with the bureaucratic machine; inequalities stemming from the gender,
age, location (region) of residence, and access to education.

**Intellectual and technological potential. Th e intellectual and technological potential is a fac-**
tor of fundamental importance for national security; the basis for working it out is constituted by
a modern, adequate education system at each level. True, the Polish education system at the primary
and secondary level may be considered to be in line with the requirements of the future[17], however,
one should also take into account that successes in the secondary school do not always translate into
achievements in high education – the standing of Polish universities in international rankings is rather
poor; in the group of the best universities there is not even one Polish higher education school. Particularly low results of Polish universities are visible in technological and bioengineering sciences.
Th is weakness of intellectual and technological potential, combined with low and oft en inadequate
expenditures on research and development, translates into low innovation levels of the whole Polish
economy, which is moving from the stage in which effi ciency is the most important factor of growth
to a stage in which what counts most is innovation. Diff erences in levels of innovativeness of Poland
and select countries of the European Union and world are shown in fi g. 34. Th is situation should be
consider a signifi cant challenge, to be managed in the coming period of time.

Polish sciences face many problems, among which the most serious ones are: the weakness of
pro-innovative attitudes, lack of full connection between research and practice, the bureaucratic manner of operation and fi nancing in decision-making circles of the economy, and the brain-drain. Th ese
factors, along with the insuffi cient fi nancing of higher education and culture, are among main reasons
for insuffi cient level of Poland’s development. However, the phenomenon may also have a positive impact, as it is oft en connected with the transfers of income and know-how onto the Polish market. Employees staying abroad gain experience hardly possible to obtain at home, and many a time they bring
certain solutions onto Polish turf. Poland should be expected that, taking care of its own interests, it
will pursue policies aiming at taking full advantage of all possible benefi ts which may stem from the
migration of specialists. Th e most favourable solution would be connected with an immediate work
on the Polish policy towards brain-drain and using this policy as a means to increase local scientifi c
and technological potential.

processes creates a network of interlinks between supranational corporations operating on various
continents, which may result – similarly as in the case of critical infrastructure – in the risk of the
“domino eff ect” with consequences that are diffi cult to predict.

In order to fully utilise the possibilities brought about by digital revolution and development of
the cyberspace, Internet users must be convinced that it is secure: sensitive information is protected,
trade online will not be interfered, and the network infrastructure is immune to infi ltration. Nevertheless, reality in this scope is far away from the perfect state. Losses resulting from criminal activities in
the cyberspace are estimated globally in hundreds billion dollars per year[18].

Another type of threats stemming from the cyberspace is also threats to the so-called information society, connected with the uncontrolled fl ow of unidentifi ed data and information which may
arise in public circulation in consequence of disinformation activities. Modern societies witness today
the process of gradual extension of the scope of information media (TV, radio and Internet) that more
and more oft en operate on international and even global scale. Th e infl uence of the media on shaping
social attitudes or views is signifi cant, which creates a risk of manipulation and a possibility of eliciting
public reactions undermining internal security of the state.

Th e role of mass media as a factor shaping social attitudes, behaviours and expectations will
grow together with expanding technological possibilities, while at the same time limiting to some
extent the signifi cance of other forms of social participation. To put it diff erently, electronic media will
slowly replace traditional social bonds (peer, collegial, environmental, and maybe also family ones).

**Th e** **“third sector” and the national security system. At present, the “third sector” is a com-**
monly used term to denote the area of public life which is separate from the private sector (the domain
of profi t-oriented enterprises) and the public sector (the domain of state institutions), in which citizens
mobilise, associate and establish entities (NGOs) in order to satisfy public needs, solve social problems
and articulate and represent collective interests (e.g. of certain communities or groups).

It should be expected that as civic society structures solidify, both the number as well as the
attractiveness of non-government organizations constituting an inseparable part of the global stream
of public diplomacy will grow. Non-governmental organizations may also be a subject of the national

18 Based on the “Norton Cybercrime Report 2011”, it was 388 billion dollars in 2010.

THE SECURITY ENVIRONMENT OUTLOOK

security policy in a negative sense – as a possible source of risk or threat. Th e risk of NGOs being
used by criminal groups to hide illegal property, launder money and avoid taxes cannot be excluded.
Besides, there may be risks connected with terrorist organizations which use e.g. charity mechanisms
(grants, subsidies, donations, etc.) or NGOs (mainly charities that lend material development support)
without the informed participation of the latter as a platform to launder illegal profi ts or to transfer
property and in-kind support to terrorists.

Economic conditions of security

**Poland and international economic relations.** In times of growing indebtedness of many
countries and persisting global economic slowdown, Poland is a country that stands out in a positive
manner, which is evidenced by the gradually improving position of Polish economy in competitiveness
rankings. An important determinant of such state of aff airs is the infl ow of foreign direct investments
to the country, which in 2011 amounted to nearly EUR 11 billion. In this regard, Poland is the leader
among 10 new EU members and in the years to come it shall probably retain its standing. Th e role of
Poland on economic markets is also evidenced by the growing importance of the Warsaw Stock Exchange which is perceived by markets as the fi nancial centre of Central and Eastern Europe.

Despite these positive phenomena, it should be borne in mind that the Polish economy is not
regarded as a highly competitive one. Among its vulnerabilities one should point to the still too low
innovativeness and eff ectiveness of the labour market, the poorly developed infrastructure, and numerous barriers such as unfavourable conditions for start-ups, long time of collection of receivables
under agreements, complex tax procedures and too long and overly formalised process of obtaining
construction permits.

One of the most important challenges for the Polish economy, which should enable it to improve its competitiveness, will be the growth of innovativeness. It requires above all a change of approach to education, which must be treated as an investment in the economy.

A dominant share in the commodity turn-over of Poland is attributed to European countries,
and particularly states of the European Union. Aft er the deep recession in 2008-2009, most of them
witnessed a slight recovery in 2010. However, negative eff ects of the fi nancial crisis are still palpable.
Th ey manifest themselves, _inter alia, in the profound indebtedness of certain EU economies or in_
a serious deterioration of ratings of many an EU country, which in turn jeopardises the prospects for
their constant development. Th e consequences of such a situation for Poland include a declining share
of commodity exchanges in this direction and its growth vis-à-vis non-European countries, such as
China, Brazil or India. It is signifi cant in the light of development forecasts for those powers in the
coming decade or more years, and at the same time in the perspective of ever-growing readiness of
Polish companies to expand on foreign markets, stepping up investments there and trade in technologically advanced commodities.

In recent years, Poland’s position in international economic relations has been systematically
strengthening and within next two decades one may expect continuation of this trend (the premises
for such situation already exist). Nevertheless it should be pointed out that Poland will not be only
a recipient of foreign capitals and a location for foreign companies, but it will also become an origin

of the expansion of domestic companies onto foreign markets. It is refl ected in the fact that in 2011,
the value of Polish foreign direct investments reached EUR 5 billion (fi g. 35). One should also bear
in mind that competitive edges in foreign trade will also change, resulting in further strengthening of
Poland’s position in trade in more advanced goods.

**Risks in the fi nancial area. Numerous destabilization factors which may adversely aff ect the**
level of security of Poland are concentrated around fi nance, above all at the internal level. However, the
eff ects of the situation in the region and in the world are also clearly noticeable. It should be stressed
that the signifi cance of the international infl uence of Polish fi nancial security will become even more
apparent along with the progress of globalization processes. Financial risks concern (and will concern
in the future), among other things, the following:

-  Th e negative infl uence of fi nancial crises in the EU countries on the economic growth and public
fi nance stability, as well as the stability of the sector of fi nancial institutions in other countries of the
European Union, including Poland;

-  Th e lack of guarantees given by relevant Polish fi nancial institutions for deposits accumulated in
branches of foreign lending institutions;

-  Th e negative infl uence of exchange rates on the market of internal currency loans;

-  Deregulation of markets and the need of their renewed regulation.

From the external surroundings engulfed by the crisis, infl ationary phenomena will penetrate
the Polish economy. Stopping the infl ation caused by factors originating from crises abroad and to develop defensive mechanisms which will alleviate the negative infl uence from the outside in the future,
is a great challenge for the Polish economic policy. Th e problem concerns fi rst and foremost the character of monetary policy, all the more so that fi ghting the soaring infl ation should not lead to arresting the growth of Polish GDP. Widespread crisis phenomena and Polish economy relations with the
global fi nancial system constrain the wiggle room for the government in economic and social policy,


-----

THE SECURITY ENVIRONMENT OUTLOOK

including the room for manoeuvre within the taxation and pension system, healthcare and transport
infrastructure. What is more, they limit the general control over globalization phenomena in the fi elds
of fi nance and technologies. Divisions and divergences among euro zone countries may also put Poland at risk of being pushed out of the main circle of European economic and political integration.

Th e European crisis also illustrated that foreign market groups may rapidly limit demand for
Polish securities. Th is may cause a sale of Polish bonds by foreign investors as well as a majority of
banks operating in Poland. Th erefore, it is necessary to increase in Poland the share of banks controlled
and managed at the national level. Poland’s security is connected with ability to fl exibly adapt to changes and to guarantee itself the participation in steering (or infl uence on) the economic processes in the
EU and inside the country, and of ensuring a relevant pace of economic growth and modernization.

**Business activity online. It is worth noting the importance of Internet business activity, which**
is not only becoming a showcase of Polish innovativeness, but is also an opportunity and a driving
force of the economy. Online economy, if accounted as a separate sector (e-economy), constitutes 2.7
of Polish GDP. Today its estimated volume amounts to PLN 35.7 billion, which accounts for a higher
share in Polish GDP than the share of the mining industry which for many years had been the pillar of
the Polish economy. It is estimated that in 2015 the value of e-economy will total nearly PLN 77 billion,
or 4.1 per cent of GDP. Th e Internet will have then a higher share in GDP than the fi nance, energy or
healthcare sector, and will grow twice as fast as GDP itself.

**Th e energy sector. Poland enjoys energy independence based on coal, but it largely depends**
on supplies of oil and gas. What is more, the problem of lack of adequate investments in the energy
infrastructure is coming to a head – energy companies are more and more ineff ective, thus increasing
energy costs. Moreover, coal has ceased to be attractive and exploiting it raises the costs of energy
independence.

In the coming years, the most critical threats in the fi eld of energy safety aff ecting the security
policy will be connected with:

-  Th e transmission grids from Russia to Western Europe, bypassing Poland and Central and Eastern
Europe, which causes the cut-off of the country from the West in the fi eld of transit and distribution
of oil and gas; all this is connected with Russia’s manner of treating energy supplies as means of
political pressure;

-  Th e dependence of the reliability of supplies on relations with producers and exporters of energy
carriers (Russia) and transit countries (Ukraine, Belarus), and also the danger of destabilization in
these countries;

-  physical stoppages in supply of energy resources;

-  the depreciation of the generation infrastructure, and transmission and distribution grids (it is the
case with nearly 70 per cent of the infrastructure).

So far, Poland has been procuring gas and crude oil from producers located in the east, as its
transmission infrastructure had been built earlier in this region. Aft er 1989, the infrastructure has not
been signifi cantly modernized, and major investments made in the mid-90s (Yamal pipeline) did not
change the supplier dominant on the Polish market. Th e construction of new gas and oil pipelines
for transmission of resources from farther regions of Russia to the European Union, without using
the existing routes running through the territory of Poland, poses challenges for energy safety of the
country. Diversifi cation of supply sources and transportation routes will enable to minimise possible
dangers stemming from disruptions of or limitations on fuel supplies. Security may be strengthened


-----

### WHITE BOOKTON NATIONAL SECURITY OF THE REPUBLIC OF POLAND

with the use of tools provided by the European Union legislation. Th ese legal instruments stimulate
the development of the free market of energy transmission and are focused on the sector of natural
gas and electricity. Implementation of the principles of the community law will reduce the potential of
monopolistic practices applied by the suppliers of energy carriers.

In the coming 10-20 years Poland is likely to witness a better diversifi cation of supplies and
a sustainable energy balance. However, the scale and character of this diversifi cation remain open. Th e
bigger it will be the more stable will be grounds for Poland’s development, and also its internal security.
Poland has at its disposal several options as regards diversifi cation of the balance and supplies. In the
case of gas supplies, short-term diversifi cation will be ensured by an LNG port which will be constructed in Świnoujście, and the construction of the so-called interconnectors (connecting pipelines) with
the Czech Republic and Germany.

Good hopes for a signifi cant strengthening of energy safety of the country lie with developing
industrial extraction of shale gas. If estimates relating to the volumes of this resource are confi rmed
during exploration work, and its extraction turns out to be technically feasible and justifi ed in economic terms, the national energy sector will undergo a signifi cant restructuring. Launching of shale gas
extraction will lead to an increased share of gas in the so-called energy mix, which will cause a reduction of demand for other, less competitive energy carriers. One cannot exclude that the development
of the gas energy sector will limit development plans of such branches as coal and nuclear energy industries. According to preliminary estimates, shale gas will guarantee 30-year coverage of the present
energy demand of Poland. Should the estimates be confi rmed, Poland would emerge as an important
exporter of the resource and ensure the diversifi cation of shale gas supply in the region. However,
should no signifi cant changes in the energy balance occur, Poland would remain to a certain extent
susceptible to the negative infl uence of possible gas confl icts or energy blackmail.

Th e crucial factor that puts the national security at risk is the systematic loss of control over Polish
deposits of energy resources. Many concessions for natural gas and unconventional gas have been
taken over by foreign companies. Such situation may result in delays in exploration and exploitation of
the resource and, in the worst scenario, a “concession freeze”. Also, Poland lacks an adequate geological service which would exercise supervision over Poland’s natural resources. Th e powers of the Polish
Geological Institute are limited and focused mainly on geological surveys and risk monitoring. Th e
postulated geological service would be a new body to take over hitherto tasks of PGI and also take on
additional tasks, connected, inter alia, with rational management of geological structures, including
fossil resources and protection thereof, as well as underground water and environment management
and protection.

New prospects would brighten for Poland also by progress in the fi eld of technology aimed at
carbon capture and storage (CCS), which generates the so-called clean carbon. Th e European Union
adopted a directive with an aim of creating a favourable regulatory framework for implementation of
CCS technology in the EU countries. Moreover, Brussels took a decision on ensuring fi nancial support
for the fi rst demonstration projects in a couple of member states, including Poland (two CCS demonstration projects).

Th e policy of reducing greenhouse gas emissions is accompanied by the so-called carbon leakage problem, namely the outfl ow of emission to a cheaper country or countries with lower standards
that do not undertake activities aimed at its reduction. European restrictions with regard to emission
and emission amounts of greenhouse gases, adopted accorded to individual countries, encourages


-----

THE SECURITY ENVIRONMENT OUTLOOK

the industry that emits particularly high volumes of pollution to transferring them to other countries
which failed to sign international treaties on climate protection. Th e scale of this phenomenon is estimated at a dozen or so per cent of the primary energy-intensive and high-emission reduction, but
some estimates indicate even several dozens per cent of outfl ow of emission abroad. In consequence
of relocation (transfer) of industrial activity to countries where restrictions connected with reduction
of the greenhouse gas emission are not as severe as in the European Union, neither does the expected
decrease in gas concentration occur, nor is the so-called ozone hole reduced in this way. Th e greenhouse eff ect that aff ects the whole globe does not decrease, while countries from which the emission
“escaped” lose not only the production, transferred (in most cases) to China, but also jobs. One cannot
rule out a total exclusion of Polish energy industry based on coal, while the “escape” of chemical, paper,
and cement industry abroad has not yet occurred solely due to the weakness of investments in these
branches. Th e EU policy related to emission quotas for carbon dioxide, provided it remains unchanged, may therefore lead not only to escape, but also liquidation of a substantial part of Polish heavy
industry, while not bringing about the expected benefi ts in limiting the greenhouse eff ect.

An opportunity for diversifi cation of the Polish energy balance is provided by the decision on
the construction of a nuclear power station, and the slowly growing share of renewable energy. Irrespective of changes in the energy balance, the problem of dependence on external factors will remain
actual in the long-term perspective. It is impossible to ensure energy the safety based on shale gas or
clean coal technology without coming to terms with necessary substantial concessions to be granted
to big concerns. In turn, relying on clean energy requires taking into account the use of rare metal
elements, necessary to exploit virtually all renewable energies, but available solely on the territory of
several countries. Purchases of fuel for nuclear plants are also connected with the necessity to import
it, while the possibilities to diversify the suppliers are very limited. Polish natural resources off er a hypothetical possibility of obtaining domestic fuel for nuclear plants, but it would call for an extremely
expensive investment process.

In addition, Poland needs a grand programme of modernization of energy infrastructure. 37
per cent of electric energy generated in Poland is produced by power plants which are 20 to 30 years
old, and 43 per cent of power plants have been operating for more than thirty years. As little as 8 per
cent are relatively new facilities (5-10 years). Despite expectations, aft er 1989 the process of an intensive build-up of the country’s energy infrastructure and its modernization has not been started. On
the contrary: the absence of necessary investments (so-called replacement investments) has resulted
in a signifi cant technical degradation. In order to reverse this tendency, measures and actions are
necessary.

**Infrastructure, including critical infrastructure (CI). Th e gradual process of making the**
modern society contingent on services and goods used in every-day live leads to the growing signifi cance of the country’s critical infrastructure.

In Poland, there are today nearly one thousand elements of this type of infrastructure, and their
number will grow. Th e scale of eff ects related to its operation is also on the increase. Th is situation
requires diagnosing possible consequences of critical infrastructure dysfunction, developing methods
of CI protection against such dysfunction, and elaborating of a model providing the population and
business entities with the conditions necessary for survival in the event of destruction or a failure of
one, few, or a larger number of CI elements. A signifi cant portion of critical infrastructure elements is
managed by business entities which are not connected with public administration. It raises a possibi

lity of using business (e.g. legal purchase of shares in an enterprise) to obtain a means of infl uence on
the level of internal security by possible CI exclusion.

Th e Polish infrastructure is quite obsolete. For instance, only 8 per cent of Polish rail tracks
are adapted for trains travelling with a velocity of more than 150 km/h, and an average railway car in
Poland has been used for nearly 30 years.

In Poland, one of the lowest rates of the highway length per area was noted. Th e nearest decade
will be of critical importance for Polish infrastructure: either it will be possible to stop the „strategic
devastation” trend through new investments, or already in 2020 the country will face a total depreciation of possessions. In order to meet the needs, infrastructural investments are necessary, which
amount to approximately EUR 16 billion a year. Th is amount is signifi cantly higher than the lending
capability of banks operating in Poland. A factor which enables planning further investments is, however, means from the European funds. Still, it is necessary to fi nd additional direct fi nancing methods
from the state budget and private companies in favour of increasing the rate of investments, even at the
expense of limiting the growth of the consumption rate. A constant growth of consumption without
a modernization of the infrastructure is bound to become impossible soon.

-  * *

Conclusions drawn from the assessment of domestic security conditions are a kind of warning signals. Should they not be addressed soon and adequately, they may become threats. Especially
serious are demographic and energy challenges, as well as those connected with rapidly developing
activities in the cyberspace.

THE SECURITY ENVIRONMENT OUTLOOK

2.4. Strategic scenarios of the development of security
conditions

Analyzing the possible development of security conditions in Poland, and assuming dynamic
changes of the international environment as well as excluding static behaviour of international and domestic actors, one may consider the following possible scenarios (variants) of unfolding of the security
conditions of the Republic of Poland for the next 20 years:

**1. An integration scenario, which assumes a possible prevalence of positive and desirable phe-**
nomena and tendencies in shaping of the future security conditions, and especially integration and
rapid economic development of the EU, including Poland;

**2. A disintegration scenario, which can materialise if unfavourable and dangerous external**
and internal phenomena prevail, including a breakdown of the European integration and the rate of
civilization development of the country;

**3. An evolutionary scenario, as a continuation of the present trends, with a relative balance of**
negative and positive phenomena from the viewpoint of Poland’s security.

While analyzing the above-mentioned scenarios one should bear in mind, however, that they
are viewed in a long, twenty-year perspective. For that reason, they may change, evolve and turn into
another in consequence of unpredictable changes in the international and domestic security environment.

An integration scenario

An integration scenario (very favourable, optimistic one) proceeds from the assumption of
intensifi cation of trends in the global, European, and domestic security environment, which are favourable to Poland, and especially: durable returning of Europe to the path of economic growth; overcoming the euro zone crisis as well as the crisis of the European Union itself, and a deeper European
integration; maintaining the vitality, coherence, and reliability of NATO; continuation of political and
military presence of the USA on European soil (including full implementation, in accordance with
the adopted schedule, of the anti-missile defence system, the American part of the European Phased
Adaptive Approach (EPAA); counteracting eff ectively terrorism and the proliferation of ballistic and
mass weapons as well as adequate respect for international law.

In this scenario, EU countries would arrive at a common solution to the euro zone crisis,
strengthen the structure of the monetary union and implement an effi cient budgetary and fi scal discipline. A Europe which is strong in economic terms would mean a competitive economy that accounts
for ca. 10 per cent of global GDP, with stable trade balance and balance of payments and a strong
currency, a guaranteed food and raw material safety (including energy), capable of further growth at
a rate enabling its signifi cant position in the world to be retained. Strong Europe would keep up with
other countries of North America, South America and the Far East in terms of innovativeness. Th is
scenario is – for obvious reasons – the most favourable one for Europe’s security in all areas, including
the military one.


-----

### WHITE BOOKTON NATIONAL SECURITY OF THE REPUBLIC OF POLAND

In the reformed Europe, Polish exports would enjoy a constant growth. By modernising the
structure of its economy thanks to the increase of the innovativeness and competitiveness and lowering the demographic pressure (by way of relevant social politics and controlled migration), Poland
would make another civilization leap forward.

A positive eff ect on the development of the country would also be evident through a successful
diversifi cation of energy carrier supplies. In the optimistic scenario it should be assumed that earlier
estimates related to the deposits of shale gas would be positively verifi ed during exploratory works, the
extraction would turn out to be easier and cheaper (as a result of technological progress) than forecast,
and Poland would not only satisfy its own energy needs, but also become a signifi cant exporter of the
natural material to the countries in the region. Having substantial and own resources of shale gas would practically mean elimination of the threat of stoppages of energy resources delivery from outside,
resources which are necessary for stable economic growth.

Such situation would allow Poland to continue stable economic development, and also make
it possible to maintain a relatively rapid increase in direct investments and export of services to EU
countries. It would boost chances for the growth of prosperity of the society, faster strengthening of
defence capabilities as a contribution to the security of NATO and the EU and for consolidation of the
role and position of Poland in the European and North Atlantic structures.

Convincing other countries that Poland is a stable country would result in the positive feedback, i.e. it would improve ranking assessments of Poland made by international fi nancing institutions
and translate into a possible increase in foreign direct investments and Poland’s access to foreign capital.
Th en, one could assume Poland’s accession to the common currency, Euro, in the second half on the
current decade. Th is in turn would positively infl uence further civilization development of Poland
and, in this regard, catching up with countries of western and northern Europe within 15 to 20 years.
Possibly, it would also be a beginning of creation of a national brand to promote Poland as a signifi cant
country of the EU. An ambitions but achievable goal would be to strenghten Poland’s position on the
market of food export and high-quality industrial consumables. Export of services to EU countries
would witness a substantial increase, which means that Polish enterprises would take over bigger and
bigger part of the added value in the European economy.

In the optimistic scenario, it would not be necessary for Poland to verify the main assumptions
of its security policy, but only make sure of entering decision-making bodies and eff ectively achieve the
detailed objectives adopted at operational and tactical level, and also help promote the positive processes
referred to above. In such situation, Poland would have infl uence on directions of the development of
European integration, inclusive of infl uence on increasing the eff ectiveness of the Common Security and
Defence Policy of the EU. It would also become a more and more important member state of an effi cient
and eff ective NATO, thus leading to ultimate liquidation of the division into “old and new” members
of the Alliance, increasing the number of Poles in international structures of the Alliance, and possibly
bringing to eff ect the deployment of further elements of NATO’s infrastructure on the Polish territory.

Of positive signifi cance for strengthening Poland’s position would be partner-like relations
with Russia, an maybe even a breakthrough in mutual relations, on the assumption that Russia would
depart from the imperial policy towards its neighbours and embark on a path to increased democracy.

A favourable international environment would create an opportunity for Poland to continue
calmly its process of modernization of the armed forces and to eliminate the existing shortcomings
in the fi eld of defence capabilities. It would also make it possible to more extensively address selected,


-----

THE SECURITY ENVIRONMENT OUTLOOK

specialist elements of the defence system, such as development of special forces or streamlining capabilities in combating cybernetic threats. Such capabilities would possibly become a showcase and an
asset of Poland on the international scene. Stable and predictable direct surroundings of the country
would enable to have more active involvement in international security abroad. Th e growing economic
strength and military potential would allow Poland to achieve the status of a regional power, able to
co-create European and global security, as well as widen its strategic horizons by way of developing
relations with new partners.

A disintegration scenario

A disintegration scenario (highly unfavourable, pessimistic one) would comprise several parallel and mutually enhancing trends that are inauspicious for Poland. One of the most signifi cant among
them would be a lasting, and even deteriorating, political, fi nancial and economic crisis in Europe,
expressing itself and resulting in social disorders, stemming from the evolution of the so-called “occupy” movement and eurosceptic circles seizing power (in the wake of elections).

A manifestation of such tendency would be fi rst of all deepening discrepancies in the interests
of the EU countries and the accompanying centrifugal tendencies in the European Union and in the
eurozone, the growing popularity of nationalist and populist groups that undermine common values,
thus leading to a weakening of the cohesion of this organization and limiting the scope of the so-called
community (integration) method. It would mean also a considerable renationalization of the security
policy and a decline of respect for international and EU law. (Alternatively, it may be the emerging of
a “two-speed union”, i.e. a permanent division of the EU countries into: the “hard core” versus the remaining countries, with Poland possibly falling outside the group of countries taking strategic decisions.) In
an extreme variant one cannot rule out a possible collapse of the euro and disintegration of the European
Union itself, which would be unavoidably accompanied by a weakened NATO and other multilateral
institutions, internal and interstate confl icts, and even a return to the power politics pressures.

A determinant of the social and economic crisis on a European scale would be: economic stagnation or recession; an ineffi cient pension and social security system in conditions of ageing societies
in the European Union as a whole; exacerbation of internal stemming from incompetent integration
of immigrants and an increasing dependence of Western European countries on supplies of energy
resources from outside.

Th e disintegration scenario would also mean a gradual decline of the European Union’s share
in world GDP, with further downward trend and weakening position of the competitive economy. It
would be bound up with a permanent balance of payment defi cit, large budget defi cits and a weak
currency (or even weaker national currencies).

When it comes to Poland, it would probably face a slower pace of the economic growth, limited fi nancial means for social goals and state security as well as the occurrence of crisis-related social
tensions. Poland would then be perceived as an economically backward region of the weakening West.
Th e biggest social and economic burden of the EU and Poland would be expenditures on social goals,
including the pension system. In case of any disintegration of the EU (from a “two-speed Europe” to
its overall collapse), Poland would risk fi nding itself in the area that is weakest in economic terms. Th e
weakening economy would result in marginalising of the political position of the EU, and also Poland,
on the international arena.


-----

### WHITE BOOKTON NATIONAL SECURITY OF THE REPUBLIC OF POLAND

Should such unfavourable circumstances really occur, a chance for Poland, which would partly
neutralise negative trends, could turn out a continuing cooperation and good relations with partners
in the Weimar Triangle and the Visegrád Group, as well as with the Baltic and Scandinavian countries.

Negative consequences of the changed correlation of forces on the continental and global scale
would also be related to a progressing decrease in the scope of presence of the USA in Europe politically (no interest in maintaining strong transatlantic bonds), militarily (withdrawal of a majority of the
stationed armed forces, abandoning plans related to the construction of the American part of the allied
ballistic missile defence system), as well as to somewhat smaller degree – economically. It would also
mean a deep crisis in the fi eld of security on the continental scale. In the extreme case, Poland would
witness a weakening of guarantees for its defence and a fall of importance of the NATO protection
function. Th e eclipse of power of the USA as a stabilising factor would disturb the strategic positions of
many allies (e.g. Israel or South Korea). Farther changes as regards involvement of the USA in Europe
would have the maximum negative infl uence on Poland and other countries of Central and Eastern
Europe and would contribute to a crisis, and even a collapse of the present defence system which is
based on NATO, the EU and strategic relations with the United States. Probably, it would lead to strategic isolation of Poland in the context of renewed competition between the powers.

Such a process would inescapably be accompanied by intensifying assertive, neo-imperialist
politics of Russia, and by attempts to partially regain its infl uences in the post-Soviet space. Such developments, which would render Poland and Europe much weaker, would pose the greatest challenge.
Russia would repeatedly and eff ectively take advantage of resources owned by it, employing them as
political means. Possible domestic problems of Russia would limit, however, its capability of assuming
full domination in Eastern Europe. Changes in the balance of powers would also lead to a constrained
stabilising role of great powers and intensifi ed chaos in international relations. It would mean, among
other things, the intensifi cation of confl icts and threats, terrorist attacks, and the erosion of counteracting globally the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction and means of their delivery. Such
development of events would result in a necessity to adopt even more costly eff orts aimed at preventing
such tendencies and their elimination. Also, one could not exclude then attempts to limit civil liberties
in the light of intensifying strategic threats.

Should Iran (and possibly other countries too) acquire nuclear weapons, it might lead to an
arms race in this fi eld. Quite likely would be the lowering of the so-called threshold of use of these
weapons in case of crisis. Th is situation would pose a threat to the existing world stability, including
also Poland in the vicinity of which large amounts of atomic weapons are located. Th e cost of Poland’s
participation in stabilizing and protection ventures would probably exceed the possibilities off ered by
the Polish economy.

In the pessimistic variant, one should also consider an exhaustion of possibilities in regard to
Poland’s economic growth, caused by arrested infl ow of EU funds, which would result in a halt of the
modernization processes in the country. Th e pace of growth of Polish economy would signifi cantly
decrease. Western investments would outfl ow from Poland to other European countries off ering lower production costs (Romania, Bulgaria, Ukraine, and countries of the former Yugoslavia), and to
non-European countries. Th e Polish banking system, in which most banks are subsidiaries of foreign
banks, makes it easy to transfer crisis-related fi nancial phenomena from outside, that is the limitation
of accessibility of lending, disposal of foreign banks’ branches, obstacles in fi nancing Polish debt, maintaining a reasonable exchange rate of the Polish zloty, etc.

THE SECURITY ENVIRONMENT OUTLOOK

Th e worst version of this scenario would mean the persistence of PLN for indefi nite time and
no possibility of entering the euro zone (should the latter survive) due to a weak condition of the Polish
economy.

Th e scenario which assumes an inhibition of the Polish economy would mean, for the Polish
exports, a probable growth of share of agricultural, low-processed products, and, at the most, a slight
growth in industrial products, and also an increased dependence on other markets. It means that the
economy would be so much uncompetitive that the trade balance would grow strongly negative.

Aggregation of unfavourable circumstances in the Polish energy sector (in internal and external terms) would create threats to development and stability of the Polish economy, and thus - to the
general security condition of the state. Pessimistically, it may be assumed that extraction of shale gas
would turn out unprofi table or its future production would be minor and remain poorly signifi cant to
play a role in satisfying the national demand for this resource.

Lack of necessary replacement investments in energy sector might also lead to radical technical degradation. If Russia took over control of the gas transit routes (provided the hitherto share of
imported gas in the Polish energy balance would be kept), it might increase the pressure potential of
the eastern neighbour.

Economic problems would also lead to an impoverishment of the society and such situation
would translate into a radicalised civil mood. Extreme groups would stand to gain public support.

Another problem for Poland would be its inability to implement EU directives in the fi elds of
climate protection as well as the limitations connected with carbon dioxide emissions and environment protection. Owing to EU restrictions, especially related to energy production based on coal, the
competitiveness of Polish industry would fall.

Th e possible accumulation of unfavourable phenomena in the internal development of Poland
would mean:

-  in the political area – deepened divisions, intensifi ed political struggles (along with their radicalization) and a paralysis of the state;

-  in the economic area – failure of modernization strategies, stagnation and recession, and a growing
dependence on import of energy resources;

-  in the social area – intensifying claim attitudes, problems stemming from the demographic decline
and immigration problems.

Such combination would cause a dramatic deterioration of the international position of Poland.
Th erefore, Poland would be forced to fundamentally redefi ne its security policy, including its rationalization and focusing on costly eff orts aimed at building up its own defence and deterrence capabilities.
Also, seeking immediate bilateral alliances in Europe would be necessary, sometimes obtained with
substantial concessions. Poland would also have to limit its international activity, and resign from
aspirations to play a defi ned role in international security operations.

In strategic terms, such developments would mean a radical limitation of Poland’s freedom of
action, a loss or dramatic limitation of its subjectivity. In such a variant it would be diffi cult to indicate
the best direction for the security policy apart from the one that prescribes damage limitation.

### WHITE BOOKTON NATIONAL SECURITY OF THE REPUBLIC OF POLAND

An evolutionary scenario

An evolutionary scenario (realistic, most probable one) is a scenario which would envisage
a continuation of the relative balance of positive and negative tendencies in the development of security environment in the context of Polish interests and their realization. It assumes that no radical
(revolutionary) changes will occur – neither overly negative, nor excessively positive ones.

In this scenario, integration processes in Europe would continue (but their pace would be fairly
less dynamic), and despite crises, basic elements of cohesion of the European Union would be preserved, inclusive of its ability (albeit limited) to operate on the international arena, also with Poland’s
participation and contribution. It is very probable that the EU will gradually manage crisis-related
phenomena and head towards a deepening of cooperation, in particular by implementing integration
elements in the fi eld of fi scal policy. In this scenario, given the above-mentioned general cohesion of
the European Union, numerous initiatives aimed at creation of the so-called ‘hard core’ may occur. Th e
German-French leadership would be quietly accepted provided that it would not be in contradiction
with the basic national interests of the member states.

Th ere are many reasons to assume that the debt crisis in the euro zone will be tamed, and
the mechanism of joint decision-making processes will be adjusted. If so, discipline would be strengthened and divergences reduced in the countries of the Union. A recovery from the crisis in the euro
zone would have a relevant infl uence on the level of valuation of the Polish debts and the exchange rate
of the Polish currency. At the same time, fi rst steps would be taken towards a greater takeover of the
burden of defence expenditures by the European allies within NATO.

Th e option of continuation of the present economic tendencies and decision-making mechanisms in the EU seems to be the most likely one, on the assumption of economic crises of low or average
intensity. Th is embraces the problem of diff erentiation of the European Union’s development rate, that
is, not to allow an existence in an institutionalized form of two integration areas. Th is process would
most probably be accompanied by a gradual weakening of the global economic position of the Union
states, including Poland, as well as a decline in their competitive capability on internal and global
markets.

In the scenario under consideration, a certain limitation of the United States’ presence in Europe would happen, and some cooperation plans would be modifi ed, however with maintaining the
Americans’ engagement within NATO. Th e probable scenario assumes that the North Atlantic Alliance would survive the crisis perturbations, and basic components that make NATO a defensive alliance
would be preserved, while at the same time new missions of the Alliance would be developed.

It may be assumed that the whole western world will also gradually restrain its domination,
including military one, on the international arena. Benefi ciaries of such situation would be fi rst of all
the so-called emerging powers gaining more infl uence on the world aff airs.

Also, it may be assumed that all the aforesaid threats and challenges as well as hotbeds will
remain, however without any distinct escalation signs, especially in the military domain.

As far as Russia is concerned, it is likely that no radical changes in its internal and foreign policy
would occur. In eff ect Russia would strive for maintaining the status quo by way of intensifi cation of an
effi cient political and economic subjection of the former Soviet Union republics (with the exception of
Baltic countries) as well as by continuous use of the energy carrier supplies for political aims. However,
eff ects of such a policy would be diverse in relation to individual countries, but would not bring about


-----

THE SECURITY ENVIRONMENT OUTLOOK

any breakthrough in the form of a strong political structure steered from Moscow as a counterweight
to the united West. Relations with the latter would constitute a dynamic combination of cooperation
and rivalry as well non-military confrontations from time to time.

It should be also assumed that over the next twenty years there would be sporadic, individual
terrorist attacks in the USA and Europe, but without any dramatic infl uence on the international policy, as it was the case with similar events at the beginning of the 21[st] century. Also, the regime of prevention of nuclear weapons and missile proliferation would not collapse, even though probably further
countries would come into possession of or steer towards obtaining such a capacity. Th is general trend
would certainly stall disarmament eff orts.

Materialization of the realistic scenario would mean an economic growth of Poland at an
average pace of 2-4 per cent yearly, which would enable retaining the present role in the regional context, but make it diffi cult to function within the “big six” of the EU. Th e infl uence of Poland on the EU
foreign policy would remain at a similar level as today, but globally it would probably decrease.

Poland would primarily become a place of manufacturing mass products, the import of which
from other continents would be unprofi table. Th is variant would also mean a slight growth in agriculture and services, both in quantitative and qualitative terms, as well as a growth in exports. An
increase in direct investments in Poland might be assumed, however at a lower level than in the optimistic scenario. At an opportune time, Poland would decide on introduction of the euro.

Poland would remain an average-developed economy in technological terms, which in connection with changes in non-European countries would mean a deterioration of its competitive edge on
the global scale. It would mean that in 2020, the Polish economy would have less favourable competitiveness perspectives for next decades (2020-2050). Faster than in Europe and Poland growth of other
centres of dynamic economy would pose a danger of marginalization in the long run, that is until 2050.
Disruptions of Poland’s internal development could hamper active actions on the international arena,
in some areas of the European security policy.

Th e evolutionary scenario also assumes a gradual putting in order of the internal crisis management system as well as a more extensive and eff ective consideration of demographic, social, cultural,
and other issues in developing a more eff ective Polish security policy.

Th e continuation of the present energy security policy would enable increasing the long-term
safety of Poland in this regard, however without a radical lessening of related threats. It would comprise construction of a nuclear plant, and completion of the liquefi ed petroleum gas port. However,
a certain dependence on gas supplies would continue, as would do the still excessive share of coal in
the energy balance (the importance of renewable energy in the resources balance, despite a gradual
growth, will remain slim). Th e situation would possibly change should the profi tability of extraction of the shale gas in Poland be confi rmed and the industrial rate of its extraction be achieved to
a degree entirely satisfying the domestic demand. It ought to be assumed that at European Union level
no legal regulations will be introduced, which would cause a signifi cant growth of costs of shale gas
extraction.

Objective external diffi culties and the insuffi cient sense of one’s own strength would enforce
“self-containment” adjustments in setting goals and implementing the Polish security policy. Even
though both NATO and the EU would remain a reference point for Poland’s security, the main stress
would be put on extension of the country’s own defensive capabilities, however to a fairly lesser degree


-----

### WHITE BOOKTON NATIONAL SECURITY OF THE REPUBLIC OF POLAND

than in the case of a pessimistic scenario. Th e Polish authorities would also have to seek additional safety guarantees through bilateral agreements (e.g. with the USA), or agreements with several select on
countries (closer cooperation within the “big six” of the EU at the expense of developing the CSDP).

Uncertainty and lack of stability in the global context would call Poland to get involved to a greater degree in the strengthening of institutions and international law, and above all in extension and
development of detailed norms and principles of conduct in relations between countries.

In this scenario, there would be a possibility of maintaining the state of internal and external
security at a level close to the present one. And even if it were slightly limited (however not in the internal context), it would nevertheless be compensated by the gradual civilization progress and economic
development of Poland.

-   *  *

Strategic conditions of Poland’s security have a increasingly complex and quickly-changing
character in qualitative terms. Th e contemporary world carries a lot of challenges and threats that call
for consolidation and solidarity both at international cooperation level and in the internal policy. At
the same time, the present opens opportunities unknown before.

Two decades that have passed since regaining by Poland of its sovereignty mark a period of
a civilization leap. It is reasonably forecast that in the next two decades this advancement will continue.

Each modern state must be prepared to respond to any scenarios, including situations which
are diffi cult to predict. In order to seek for an answer to questions related to future security conditions, it is not enough to articulate warnings against the threats that should be staved off, but also to
recognize opportunities which should not be squandered. Of equal importance is to correctly identify
challenges to be taken up, as well as to assess and reduce the risks stemming from the country’s own
activity.

(OPERATIONAL STRATEGY)

OPERATIONAL STRATEGY

Th e diagnosis of Poland’s security and the forecast of development of its conditions provide the
foundation for formulating a concept of strategic activities (operational strategy). Th e concept is understood as a division (area) of national security (state security) strategy encompassing the rules and
methods of attaining strategic objectives (implementation of operational strategic tasks in the fi eld of
national security) in the predicted security conditions (environment) as well as the determination of
operational requirements with regard to the national security system.

3.1. Fo undation and guiding principle
of the operational strategy

Current challenges for Poland’s national security system are scattered and more numerous than
ever before in the contemporary history. It is a qualitatively new situation which requires a modifi cation of the state’s approach towards security issues. In this context, the possible scenarios of shaping
Poland’s future security conditions – integration, disintegration and evolution – imply three operatio**nal strategy** **options:**
1. An option of maximum internationalization of Poland’s security, related at the same time to
a shift of priorities towards non-military actions – corresponding to the integration scenario;
2. An option of strategic autarky (self-reliance and self-suffi ciency), assuming a decisive strengthening of self-reliance as far as the state’s activity in the fi eld of security is concerned, in the context of
a crisis of the collective defence policy in Europe and in the transatlantic community – corresponding to the disintegration scenario; and
3. An option of sustainable internationalization and autonomy of Poland’s security, assuming the
strengthening of allied bonds and bilateral relations with the most important partners and, through
this, making external pillars more credible, with the simultaneous readiness to act autonomously in


-----

### WHITE BOOKTON NATIONAL SECURITY OF THE REPUBLIC OF POLAND

situations in which full allied credibility cannot be guaranteed – corresponding to the evolutionary
scenario.

Th e planning of actions of the state within the framework of the operational strategy should,
pursuant to the most likely scenario of the development of security conditions, be founded on the
third option – of sustainable internationalization and autonomy of Poland’s security. At the same time,
however, one should predict and include in plans a possibility or a necessity of appropriate implementation of elements included in the options of both maximum internationalization and autarky.

Within the basic option, it is possible to distinguish three main operational priorities (main
security policy guidelines):

-  **Maintaining and demonstrating one’s determination and readiness to act within a full spectrum**
of national security domains, fi elds and sectors, in particular with regard to those in which allied
(joint) action could be hampered.

-  **Strengthening the international security community, in particular by acting in favour of deep-**
ening of integration processes based on a community of interests and values, including especially
the consolidation of the North Atlantic Alliance in relation to the function of collective defence, the
development of the EU Common Security and Defence Policy, as well as strengthening of strategic
partnerships (also with the USA), and within their framework – of the strategic good neighbourliness;

-  **Supporting and selective participating in actions of the international community aiming at** preventing the emergence of hotbeds or the spillover of already existing crises on the basis of an explicit
international mandate.

Depending on conditions and development of the situation, strategic activities may take on
a form of one of three types:

-  **Stabilizing security (promoting and developing cooperation, seizing opportunities, taking up chal-**
lenges, preventing risks and threats, etc.);

-  **Crisis response/management (monitoring, recognizing, informing, preventing, suppressing, eli-**
minating eff ects of a crisis);

-  **Defensive measures (deterring, preventing, repelling aggression, counter-attacking).**

Guided by the priorities enumerated above, as well as taking into consideration the three types
of strategic activities, one can distinguish a range of signifi cant actions (operations) in the domain of
security which Poland should undertake with the aim of pursuing national interests and achieving
strategic objectives. Th ese actions should be part of an active policy of seizing opportunities and pre-emptive risk reduction in the domain of security.

Th e most important action, which conditions all other actions, consists in achieving agree**ment (consensus) of all political forces regarding the political will to treat national security issues**
**as a priority of the state policy. Such a will, underpinned by consensus, should be presented in an**
unambigous and decisive way, both in domestic policy and – or perhaps primarily – in external policy.
National security needs to be placed above all political (party) divisions. It is a foundation of the eff ectiveness of all other strategic operations in the domain of security. It conditions the strength of Poland
in international relations, which is needed in order to both “attract and deter” – to attract allies and
partners, and to deter potential adversaries. What is more, it enables to respond eff ectively, if necessary,
to any possible pressures, political and military blackmail, as well as other forms of information warfare in international relations, which may intensify in the years to come. A good place to forge political


-----

OPERATIONAL STRATEGY

agreement in relation to security issues above party divisions is the National Security Council, which
operates with the participation of persons constitutionally responsible for the security of the state. For
the past three years, it is also possible for leaders of all political forces represented in the parliament to
join the work of the Council.

Political will and consensus among the most important political forces are especially needed
in elaborating a new National Security Strategy of the Republic of Poland, a document defi ning the
national interests and strategic objectives in the fi eld of security, describing a prospective development
of the international environment, and defi ning operational and preparatory actions connected with
the integrated system of national security.

In addition to shaping and presenting a consistent and uniform political position in terms of
matters which are key as far as security is concerned, the second strategic activity within domestic
policy consists in responding in a professional (adequate and eff ective) manner to all current in**ternal threats, which are detrimental to state institutions and safety of citizens. It refers not only to**
routine operations of the national authorities, but also to responses to crisis situations and to the implementation of tasks in situations of particular dangers in which the Constitution of the Republic of
Poland foresees introduction of a state of emergency. It also refers to active policy in terms of new and
important areas of security, such as cyber security, energy security, and fi nancial and social security.

A wide complex of strategic activities in the fi eld of security is related to the strengthening of
**the international security community. In this regard, Poland should concentrate on three fundamen-**
tal tasks: consolidating NATO in its defence function; engaging in the deepening of the integration
processes in the European Union in the domain of the CSDP; and developing strategic partnerships
(also with the USA) and good neighbourly relations (including the strengthening of the status of an
entity for the East European countries).

Establishing and intensifying relations with emerging powers should constitute an additional
objective.

Th e main external pillar of Poland’s security is NATO. Th is is why the key activity in the framework of NATO should be the strengthening of the Alliance’s credibility and, in particular, the con**solidation of its defence function. For Poland’s security, it is necessary to strongly support the fun-**
damental principle of collective defence as refl ected in Article 5 of the Washington Treaty. In this
connection, it is important to strive for the eff ectiveness of allied mechanisms designed for the purposes of collective defence, such as: periodical revision of contingency plans, conduct of exercises with
the participation of troops based on scenarios foreseeing the use of Article 5 of the North Atlantic
Treaty, and an even territorial distribution of the allied infrastructure. It is also important to maintain
the reliable defence planning within NATO. Its planning documents have to include the requirement
to have adequate military capabilities for all, and not only the most likely contingencies, i.e. also for the
most demanding collective defence missions.

Moreover, the military capabilities of the NATO member states should be strengthened, as
they have been depleted due to the decrease in defence spending in the wake of the economic crisis.
In this context, it may be helpful to carry out common projects within the concept of “smart defence”.
Poland should also constantly strive for an increase in appropriate defence expenditure of all member
states. Aiming to achieve the level desired by NATO, close to 2 per cent of GDP, should be the goal.
Joint threat assessment eff ectuated by the member states is also essential for the sake of the unity and
cohesion of the Alliance.

Poland should emphasize the fact that only the eff ectiveness as a transatlantic defence alliance
allows NATO to reliably engage in bringing crisis situations under control and settling confl icts outside the treaty area. For this purpose, political agreement will be necessary regarding these NATO
operations which require the involvement of all member states, as well as those where the fl exibility
rule can be further developed. At the same time, it should be emphasized that the essential value of the
Alliance is its unity. Th at is the reason why special attention should be paid to minimizing the risk of
adversely undermining NATO’s unity while applying the rule of fl exibility.

Another necessary task to be undertaken in the framework of NATO is strengthening the
transatlantic ties between Europe and the United States. Th e North Atlantic Alliance should remain
the principal forum of this cooperation.

An important task of reinforcing the security of NATO’s treaty area is the construction of an
allied anti-missile defence system. Poland advocates its fi nalization on time, including the deployment
on Polish soil of elements of the allied system delivered by the United States within the framework of
the European Phased Adaptive Approach (EPAA).

An important role in NATO’s policy is also played by the allied partnership policy. It refers,
_inter alia, to Poland’s steady support for the “open door policy”, as well as to the Alliance’s cooperation_
with Ukraine and Georgia within the NATO–Ukraine Commission and the NATO–Georgia Commission. Th e allied partnership policy is currently focused on NATO’s southern neighbourhood in
particular. Nevertheless, Poland should strive for its geographical (and, consequently, also fi nancial)
balance, especially in the Eastern Europe.

Poland is also interested in the development of NATO-Russia cooperation, particularly in such
areas as combating terrorism, non-proliferation of weapons of mass destruction and their means of delivery, and exchanges of data relating to airspace traffi c (Cooperative Airspace Initiative). Th e condition
for the eff ectiveness of this cooperation is the rule of reciprocity and transparency.

Th e development of the European Union, is the second external pillar of Polish security policy. The EU countries will remain the main economic partner having by far the largest share in the


-----

OPERATIONAL STRATEGY

Polish trade balance and in cumulative foreign investments. Th erefore, the Polish economy will remain
highly correlated with the economic condition of the EU.

For Poland’s security, its engagement in the deepening of security integration processes in Europe is very important. It is fundamentally critical in the context of the EU’s ability to play the role of
a signifi cant actor in this fi eld. Th e character of the European integration is functional. Th e prospects
of integration depend on whether it will adequately respond to the needs and interests of the member states. At the moment, it is at a turning point. For the integration, the crisis in the euro zone is
an existential challenge, which calls into question the potential of mutual trust between the member
states.

Poland should ensure that it will be able to participate in all Union decision-making processes.
A guarantee of being rooted in the EU mainstream would be the joining the euro zone at the most
favourable moment for Poland. From the Polish perspective, the preparation for joining the euro zone
would be connected with a fi rm striving to balance the public debt and the budget defi cit. Entry into
the euro zone will also have to respond to signifi cant challenges. Th e requirement to maintain a moderate budget defi cit under control and to carefully monitor the functioning of the banking system is of
special meaning in this context.

Poland’s ambition should be to join the avant-garde of the EU countries, which would allow to
ensure better development conditions, as well as a greater impact on decision-making processes and
the future shape of the EU.

Poland should also aim at building a strong position of the EU in the world, building its maximum defence against the existing crisis and maintaining the ability to infl uence global processes more
effi ciently. Th e creation of CSDP structures and procedures, in particular the European External Action Service (EEAS), needs to be accelerated. In this context, Poland should try to increase the number
of its diplomats working in the EEAS.

Strengthening of the CSDP would have a positive impact on the strengthened global position
of the Union.

Poland should support further enlargement of the EU not only because of the stabilizing infl uence of that process on the direct neighbourhood of Poland, but also because of the additional eff ect
supporting the image of the EU as a strategic actor involved in shaping the global balance of power.

Th e dynamic process of changes in the neighbourhood of the EU (Eastern Europe, North Africa, the Middle East, potentially the Arctic), the evolving global balance of powers which is infl uenced
by emerging powers and the global economic crisis, all have forced the Union to face the challenge of
redefi ning its interests and the objectives of its security policy. Th e strategic foundation of the EU – the
2003 European Security Strategy – has become less and less adequate to the contemporary security
environment. Th is observation is supported by the fact that at the same time the EU itself is changing
because of its own widening and deepening (Treaty of Lisbon).

Of late, the member states are increasingly interested in the debate regarding strategic problems
related to the functioning of the Union, both at the regional and global level. Th e need to elaborate
a new EU strategic document in the domain of security has been noticed. In 2012, actions were undertaken to develop a European Global Strategy. Th eir results will hopefully constitute an important point
of reference in the debate regarding a new EU security strategy.

A new security strategy should comprehensively diagnose the European Union as a security
actor in order to determine its mission in this domain more precisely than before. It will also be indispensable to review and agree upon a catalogue of common interests and strategic objectives of the
member states. Moreover, it is desirable to determine, by way of the assessment and forecast of the development of the close and distant security environment of the Union, the most probable scenarios of
its evolution. Th e new security strategy should outline, in accordance with these scenarios, a concept
of framework actions. Th ey would aim at the achievement of agreed objectives (operational strategy),
as well as at preparing the necessary ways and means and keeping them ready (preparatory strategy).

From the Polish point of view, the most important common interests of the EU countries include the following:
1. Th e Union should have at its disposal an appropriately strong, commensurate with threats, security
potential, including the defence one.
2. Th e capacity to ensure individual (citizens) and collective (population) protection against random
and deliberate threats to their lives and health;
3. Th e guarantee of safe conditions for the development of societal and economic potential of all
member states, as well as optimal use of this potential in the support of security operations.

Strategic objectives of the member states derive directly from their common interests. Th e Union
should conduct an active policy of using opportunities and reducing risks pre-emptively, which implies
the need to conduct international military and civilian security operations. In this context, a particular role
is played by the ability of the EU to stabilize its neighbourhood. Moreover, the Union should maintain its
political decision-making, planning and training readiness to eff ectively respond to threats faced by the EU
countries. Th is will imply a necessity to elaborate mechanisms for co-operation between the Union and
NATO, as well as a reform of the EU operational planning and command system.

OPERATIONAL STRATEGY

**Treaty on the European Union**

**Article 42 para 6. Th ose Member**
States whose military capabilities
fulfi l higher criteria and which have
made more binding commitments to
one another in this area with a view
to the most demanding missions
shall establish permanent structured
cooperation within the Union
framework

**Treaty on the Functioning of the**
**European Union**

**Article 222 para 1. Th e Union and**
its Member States shall act jointly in
a spirit of solidarity if a Member State
is the object of a terrorist attack or
the victim of a natural or man-made
disaster. Th e Union shall mobilise
all the instruments at its disposal,
including the military resources made
available by the Member States, to:
a) prevent the terrorist threat in the
territory of the Member States;
protect democratic institutions
and the civilian population from
any terrorist attack; assist a Member State in its territory, at the
request of its political authorities,
in the event of a terrorist attack;
b) assist a Member State in its territory, at the request of its political
authorities, in the event of a natural or man-made disaster.


In addition to the elaboration of the above-mentioned strategy, it is important to join specifi c practical
projects reinforcing the CSDP. For Poland it means a continuing commitment to the reform of the EU battle groups concept, aiming at their actual consolidation and use
as a real, practical tool of the EU Common Security and
Defence Policy, strengthening of the EU-NATO cooperation, particularly between the European Defence Agency
and NATO’s Allied Command Transformation, as well
as creation of a permanent EU command for the purposes of military operations. Poland should also back the
strengthening of the European military potential by developing, within the framework of multinational projects,
capabilities to be at the disposal of individual countries
(pooling and sharing), as well as by cooperation in the
fi eld of development and purchase of armaments.

A possible evolution option for the CSDP may be
an emergence of a European leadership (“avant-garde”) in
security matters, which would translate into bigger CSDP
eff ectiveness, strengthening of civilian and military crisis response capabilities, as well as modernization and
wider cooperation of defence industries of the European
states. In such a situation, Poland should seek to join the
avant-garde. Actions of this kind could be implemented
through the provision of _permanent structured coopera-_
_tion, laid down in the Treaty on the European Union (tak-_
ing account of the amendments introduced by the Treaty
of Lisbon (Article 42 para. 6), for which the Weimar Triangle could constitute an initiative group. Irrespective of
the current concerns about a threat to the EU cohesion,
Poland should actively participate in the enhanced cooperation mechanism, which creates a chance for real reinforcement of the Common Security and Defence Policy.

Poland should also strive to eff ectuate the provisions of both the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union regarding the solidarity clause (Article 222),
and of the Treaty on the European Union, pertaining to
the mutual defence clause (Article 42 para. 7). Th e fi rst
treaty establishes an obligation to cooperate and to support each other in the event of a terrorist attack or natural
disasters and crises. Th e second one establishes a requirement for cooperation in the event of an armed attack. Th e
entry into force of the Treaty of Lisbon notwithstanding,


-----

### WHITE BOOKTON NATIONAL SECURITY OF THE REPUBLIC OF POLAND

successful operational implementation of the two clauses is not prejudged. Th is creates room for active
Polish diplomacy.

In order to ensure the consistency of this eff ort with actions undertaken by the entire EU,
it is necessary to strengthen the common security threat assessment, and hence develop the strategic culture. Th e development of EU civilian capabilities in the realm of crisis response is important
as well.

**Strategic cooperation between NATO and the EU, including reinforcement of its political**
cohesion and an increase in the eff ectiveness of their actions, will also be very signifi cant for Poland’s
security. Th e initial stage of Poland’s membership of NATO and the European Union ran in parallel
with profound transformations of both organizations. From the moment of its accession, Poland has
consequently been in favour of deeper integration within the framework of both the North Atlantic
Alliance and the European Union, assuming that the very existence of the two organizations is an
eff ective guarantee of its own security. At present – in the face of structural strains which aff ect both
NATO and the EU – Poland has to move to another stage of its membership of the two organizations
by promoting solutions which would enhance their strength for the benefi t of Poland.

It is particularly important to strive for enhancing NATO–EU cooperation, which would
pursue the goal of creating a Euro-Atlantic security tandem able to eff ectively head off an entire
spectrum of contemporary threats. It is in Poland’s interest that the two organizations complement
each other within the framework of strategic partnership and, thanks to the resulting synergy, obtain better results of joint actions. In this respect, it is important to ensure a better coordination of
initiatives regarding the development of defence capabilities both within NATO, in the framework
of the smart defence initiative, and within the EU, with regard to the pooling and sharing concept.
Direct cooperation between the two organizations in international security operations conducted in
the same places is needed too.

**Strategic partnerships and good-neighbourliness. It is in the interest of Poland to develop a close**
strategic cooperation with the USA, with other strategic partners and with the neighbouring states.

Th e United States is currently reducing its military presence in Europe. Th is process should
not be played down by the European members of NATO. Poland should advocate a decreased scale of
withdrawal of the US military potential and help defi ne the new foundations of American presence
by linking it closely with the readiness to respond to threats to Euro-Atlantic security. Simultaneously,
Poland should aim at a real increase in European military capabilities within the CSDP.

Poland should develop its cooperation with the United States, as this collaboration serves to
consolidate transatlantic ties and allows both sides to achieve measurable benefi ts. It should, among
other things, concern enhancing the ability to undertake joint actions and joint military operations.

Th e success of Polish-American cooperation in the domain of security will in the coming years
be determined primarily by the eff ectiveness of implementation of specifi c military cooperation programmes (training, in particular, of special forces, permanent presence of the US Air Force component
in Poland and consistent implementation of plans to build the American part of the allied anti-missile
defence system, to be deployed in the Polish territory in the third phase of EPAA), which are perceived
to be advantageous for both sides.

It is in Poland’s interest to have the American arsenal of tactical nuclear weapons (TNW) kept
in Europe and to oppose various proposals for its unilateral withdrawal. Alternatively, reductions of

OPERATIONAL STRATEGY

TNW should be taken into consideration solely in accordance with the rule of transparency and reciprocity in relations with Russia.

Th e multidimensionality of Polish-American relations, consisting in expanding the scope of
cooperation to a greater number of fi elds and areas (energy, science and research, etc.), and thus deepening the sphere of joint Polish–American interests, should become a new paradigm.

Poland should work in favour of consolidating the status of an entity for the East European
**states.** Th is refers, in particular, to countries covered by the Eastern Partnership initiative of the EU.
Th e Eastern dimension of the Union’s policy has to be continued and deepened by Poland as the advocate and promoter of this region. Consequently, it is especially important to share the transformation
experience, to constantly support the pro-western vector in Ukraine’s security policy, and to gradually
include Ukraine in the mechanisms of European integration. Th e quality of cooperation between the
EU and Poland, on one hand, and Ukraine, on the other, will considerably determine the evolution
of developments across Eastern Europe. Th e development of relations with Moldova and the South
Caucasus states – in addition to the support for their modernization and their European choice (in
particular, in the cases of Georgia and Moldova) – promotes stabilization in unsettled confl ict zones.
Poland should strongly defend the principle of territorial integrity of states in the region, as well as
their right to freely choose alliances. Outside Eastern Europe, benefi cial prospects for Poland are also
off ered by closer relations with the Central Asian states by way of, inter alia, the possibility to import
natural resources and the geopolitical position of the sub-region. A more extensive cooperation should
be developed with Belarus, as soon as it starts meeting the basic criteria for democratization.

Th e foregoing actions ought to be accompanied by a development of cooperation with Russia
based on the rule of reciprocity. Th e appropriate way to proceed in this regard is, however, to free
relations with this partner from the logic of spheres of infl uence. Russia still considers Eastern Europe
a territory in which a zero-sum game is played. Proceeding from this assumption, Russia seeks to
consolidate a quasi-monopolistic infl uence across the former Soviet Union space. It is in the Polish
interest to demonstrate that the Europeanization of Eastern Partnership states is also advantageous for
Russia, since it is tantamount to implanting the principles of democracy, building the predictability at
the socio-political level and the stable economic development. All this contributes to an increased stabilization of the region, thus serving the common interests of the European Union (including Poland)
and Russia. Th e fi rst step towards establishing of a common foundation of norms and similar rules of
conduct in the triangle of the EU–Eastern Europe–Russia may consist in extending the WTO norms
to all states of the region (note that Belarus and Azerbaijan, as well as Kazakhstan, remain outside the
organization).

**Cooperation with neighbours is also important for the security of Poland. It takes place both**
in formal (Weimar’s Triangle, Visegrád Group) and ad hoc formats (the Baltic states). Th e Nordic countries are also important partners, as they are interested not only in the security in the Baltic Sea, but
also in political cooperation at regional and global levels (e.g. the common Polish-Norwegian initiative
regarding tactical nuclear weapons).

Afghanistan, patrol in Ghazni province.

Developing strategic good-neighbourly relations with Ukraine is of special importance for Poland. Independent, stable, and open for cooperation Ukraine is a key element of stability in Central
and Eastern Europe.

Taking a glance on the neighbourhood issues from a broader perspective, in the era of decreasing defence expenditure in Europe, which is especially notable in Poland’s closest vicinity, states
that are trying to maintain their military ambitions at levels adequate to the challenges are gaining in
importance. In this context it is worthwhile to mention Romania and Turkey as potential partners in
politico-military cooperation.

Relations between Poland and emerging powers in terms of economy constitute an opportunity for development. As an EU member, Poland will become an increasingly attractive investment
market for enterprises from the BRIC countries which will want to access the European common
market. Moreover, by means of cooperation with these countries, Poland will open new avenues of
exportation for its domestic products.

As far as the military dimension is concerned, it is important, however, to pay attention to military expenditure of these countries. A signifi cant, abrupt augmentation of their spending would pose
a serious challenge for NATO, the EU – so would for Poland.

**Participation in activities of the international community aimed at nipping dangers in the**
bud is an important operational priority. A revitalization of other than NATO and EU organizations,
institutions and international security regimes would be a factor enhancing this course of action.

Globally, it is advisable to increase the activity and emphasize the importance of Poland in
the United Nations. A catalogue of actions should comprise more active involvement in the debate
undertaken by the UN on the eff ectiveness of peace operations. Furthermore, Poland should take
into consideration the renewal of its participation in select peace missions carried out by the UN, and

increasing its engagement in disarmament eff orts (in particular, to implement the Chemical Weapons
Convention and the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons).

Regionally, there is a need to restore the importance of the Organization for Security and
Co-operation in Europe. However, the process requires a constructive approach on the part of all participating states to cooperation within the OSCE.

It is also necessary to review the norms of international law, which would increase its eff ectiveness in countering new threats, especially those related to the proliferation of weapons of mass
destruction, terrorism and organized crime, as well as to the destabilizing infl uence of failed countries.
It also concerns the enhancing of the eff ectiveness of regimes and regulations in the domain of arms
control and disarmament, as well as confi dence- and security-building measures. In many cases, in
particular in the fi eld of terrorism and cybernetic threats, given the network nature of the phenomena
which have to be head off, intensive international cooperation becomes more and more important and
is an indispensable condition of successful eff orts.

Th e character of modern and future threats to security necessitates identifi cation of their
sources as early as possible and taking quick preventive actions as the main operational strategy principle. It is necessary to undertake comprehensive actions which take into account political, economic,
social and military elements. Not only states and international organizations, but also NGOs should be
involved in the above-mentioned actions. Poland should also take part in these actions.

Participation in operations beyond national borders is a signifi cant tool of the Polish foreign
and security policy. At the same time, it is a source of operational experience and one of the indicators of the transformation course of the Polish Armed Forces. Military actions should be concurrently
reinforced by means of civilian involvement (actions aimed at achieving political stability and ensuring social rehabilitation and economic reconstruction of confl ict regions), including the provision of
development assistance.

### WHITE BOOKTON NATIONAL SECURITY OF THE REPUBLIC OF POLAND

It is necessary to analyze Poland’s involvement in the actions of the international community
taken in recent years in order to settle regional and global confl icts, crises and problems. Th at is the
basis on which the most important criteria of such participation in the coming years should be established. Decision-making on whether Poland should participate in a given operation ought to result
from its national interests, strategic objectives and capabilities of (resources possessed by) the state.
Th e secondary criterion would refer to the entity carrying out the operation (NATO, the EU, the UN,
the OSCE or a coalition of the willing ones). An important premise of taking a decision with regard to
Poland joining a given operation is whether the latter has been given an explicit international mandate.

3.2. S trategic tasks of national security operational
subsystems

Th e defence subsystem

Th e basic course of action of the defence subsystem is the permanent readiness to eff ectively respond to threats to the independence and territorial integrity of the Republic of Poland. In this respect,
Poland should also encourage security organizations, of which Poland is a member, to maintain and
enhance their readiness to undertake political decision-making, planning and training actions. Supplementary actions should focus on conducting active policy of using opportunities and pre-emptive
risk reduction in the domain of security, e.g. by participating in international eff orts to avert dangers,
including international security operations.

**Security activities of the foreign service. Th e globalization and the increasing scale of inter-**
national interdependence have shed new light on the security-related tasks of the diplomatic service
which has to adjust its actions to the changing milieu.

It is assumed here that Poland’s alliances, as well as its current structures and international
relations will continue in the long term. Th erefore, Polish diplomacy should constantly participate in
actions aimed at consolidating their cohesion, reliability and eff ectiveness.

Th e Polish diplomacy has to take into account the ongoing strategic change consisting in the
shift ing of the centre of global economy from the Atlantic area towards the Asia-Pacifi c region. For the
diplomacy, it would imply a task of expanding partnerships with the emerging powers.

Th e most important tasks of the Polish diplomacy in the context of requirements related to the
national security concern:

-  Maintaining the importance of the fundamental NATO mission, that is the common defence, while
expanding the activity of the Alliance by adding new tasks, also in the domain of crisis management
and cooperative security;

-  Participating in the renewing of the European project via both political initiatives and eff ective
communication of benefi ts which arise for Poland thanks to the European integration;

-  Intensive support for improving the EU Common Security and Defence Policy by enhancing it on
a politico-strategic (amendment of the European Security Strategy), as well as institutional (permanent command) and operational (EU battle groups) levels;

-  Developing cooperation with the strategic partners in the EU, including Germany and France in
the framework of the Weimar Triangle, as well as building possibly durable coalitions with the
countries of the Visegrád Group and of the Baltic Sea region;


-----

OPERATIONAL STRATEGY

-  Expanding the spectrum of bilateral cooperation with the United States (energy, science and research, innovations) while intensifying politico-military cooperation;

-  Developing the partnership with Russia in accordance with the principles of reciprocity, transparency and respect for the sovereignty of neighbouring countries;

-  Promoting non-proliferation of weapons of mass destruction and their means of delivery as well as
arms control, and disarmament;

-  Strengthening the European energy policy by way of building up the transmission infrastructure
and respecting the competition rules, also in relation to entities from energy-supplying countries;

-  Developing relations with emerging powers, including the dialogue with regard to security.

**Military activities. As was mentioned before, the key course of action of the defence subsystem is**
to maintain the political decision-making, planning and training readiness to eff ectively respond to threats
to the independence and territorial integrity of Poland. Ultimately, the Polish Armed Forces have to be
able to eff ectively perform three key missions, the scope of which will not change compared with the one
currently adopted in strategic documents. Th ese three missions are and will be: defence of the state, international engagement, and support of internal security (public and civil institutions of the state). A certain
re-assessment should, however, take place in relation to the emphasis placed on each of them.

Th e fundamental task of the armed forces should remain the defence of their own territory. In
this context, they should be ready to: act autonomously in case of a small-scale local confl ict; receive
allied force back-ups and retain certain points of defence until their arrival in case of a large-scale
confl ict; participate in an allied defence operation in the event of an attack on another state, in keeping
with the principles of collective defence. Th e mission of defending the national territory also includes
the function of military deterrence by demonstration of the readiness to defence with the use of forces
kept in peacetime and the readiness to mobilize them in the event of a large-scale war.

Th e Polish Armed Forces should be ready to carry out counter-surprise operations and to independently operate in the most eff ective possible way in consensus-challenging situations, i.e. in which
it is diffi cult to reach a consensus (among allies), as well as in the circumstances of aterritorial, selective, unpredicted threats of a limited scale, caused by unclear or hidden political motives. Th e doctrinal
premises and the guiding principle of the national defence should fully correspond with the strategy
of NATO as a whole, but, above all, they should take into account the Polish national interests and
conditions for their implementation.

Within the second mission, the Polish Armed Forces should stay in readiness for engaging in
various types of international security operations conducted both at regional and global levels in an
increasingly complex environment. Such engagement should be considered a signifi cant tool of the
Polish foreign and security policy (support for the diplomacy), ensuring the infl uence on shaping
the international environment. At the same time, it is a source of operational experience and one of
indicators of the directions of transforming the Polish Armed Forces.

Th e level of future involvement in the activities pursued in the international arena is contingent
on the capabilities of the state determined by fi nancial, human, material and organizational resources.
Th e decision concerning the participation of the armed forces should result from the national interests
and capabilities of the state, as well as international obligations towards allied partners and organizations. While making a decision regarding any participation in future missions, it is necessary to take
into consideration primarily the convergence of aims of these missions with the Polish interests and
strategic objectives.


-----

### WHITE BOOKTON NATIONAL SECURITY OF THE REPUBLIC OF POLAND

Th e third mission of the Polish Armed Forces is to support national security and to render help
to the society. Fulfi lling this function they should: monitor and protect the airspace; support the protection of the land borders and territorial waters; conduct reconnaissance and intelligence activities;
monitor radioactive, chemical and biological contaminations in the territory of the country; clean
off the territory from explosive remnants and dangerous military objects; conduct search-and-rescue
operations; and aid the state authorities, public administration and the population in crisis situations
and in the event of natural disasters.

As far as the security of the state is concerned, apart from the above-mentioned basic missions
of the armed forces, the following additional operational tasks should be performed:

-  Pursuing the expansion of military cooperation between NATO and the EU, based on the rule of
complementariness;

-  Developing the capability to receive allied back-up forces in the territory of Poland and to conduct
exercises preparing to joint operations;

-  Contributing to the development of EU military capabilities related to crisis response;

-  Building confi dence in relations with Russia (on the reciprocity principle) by expanding the military cooperation within the existing possibilities resulting from the membership of NATO;

-  Participating in the verifi cation of compliance with agreements on arms control, disarmament and
confi dence- and security-building measures, including, in particular, avoiding unfavourable changes in the balance of military forces in the region;

-  Cooperating in the fi eld of modernization and reconstruction of Poland’s industrial defence capacity, in line with the national needs; and

-  Assisting in the evacuation of Polish citizens from abroad in a situation in which their lives would
be at risk.

Th e armed forces are responsible primarily for executing defence tasks. However, changes in
Poland’s security environment constantly result in accumulating new tasks. Th e increasingly ambitious
strategic objectives of Poland in the domain of security, along with the globalization, force changes
in some of the tasks and have impact on the sustainability of engagement of the forces. Th ey also call
for undertaking action in a diffi cult operationally environment and cooperating with numerous, both
military and civilian, participants in order to achieve common goals. Th e limits of military action are
determined by an ever-increasing range of legal regulations. Th e tasks executed by the armed forces are
and will be watched and assessed with a growing interest by the media and the society. Th e situation
calls for adjustment, i.e. constant transformation of the armed forces in order to enable them to eff ectively and timely perform tasks which are laid before them by the state.

**Intelligence activities. Th e intelligence services should: recognize and inform about the**
existing and potential threats to Poland, its interests and citizens; identify and monitor opportunities
for and risks to the national security; support the forces participating in operations outside the country; track the international trade in arms and the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction and
their means of delivery; monitor actions related to energy and raw materials policy; expand their own
capabilities by cooperating with allies and coalition partners. Th e mission of the intelligence should
also be to eff ectively identify intentions of third countries that are detrimental to the Polish interests.

Apart from operational activities conducted by the intelligence services, an important role, as far
as security is concerned, is played by open-source intelligence. Tasks performed in this fi eld are focused
on analyzing and processing information from publicly available sources (mainly from the mass media,
including open electronic communication means, registries, personal sources) concerning, in particular,


-----

OPERATIONAL STRATEGY

events, places and persons having potential impact on the internal and external security of the state. Th e
“verifi ed open-source intelligence”, which comprises data collected from open sources and databases, including confi dential information, is equally important. Open-source intelligence constitutes one of the
priorities of analytical and information activities performed by the services and is an integral part of all
activities conducted within the framework of precise intelligence (operational) tasks described above.

**Counterintelligence activities in support of the Polish Armed Forces and defence industry.**
An extremely important aspect of the military counterintelligence activities consists in preventing
actions which could threaten the security or combat capability of the Polish Armed Forces. In this
context, important are activities aimed at protecting the security of military units and personnel of
the armed forces. Among the specifi c tasks, one should mention activities aimed to counter espionage,
to prevent attempts at military units and defence facilities and installations, corruption in the area of
threats to national defence, as well as violations of classifi ed information security, including the aspect
of information combat in cyberspace. Another signifi cant task within this area is to protect the security
of research and development ordered by the armed forces and other units of the Ministry of National
Defence, as well as to secure the production and turnover of military goods, technologies and services.

**Defence production. In the coming years, the Polish industrial defence potential should be**
engaged, to the maximum extent, in the processes of technical modernization of the Polish Armed
Forces. Analysis of the problem indicates that the Polish defence industry entities are capable of
producing, within a relatively short period of time (2–3 years), elements of armaments and military
equipment demanded by the Polish army.

Support for Polish arms companies and enterprises and their involvement in the implementation
of the prioritized modernization programmes of the Ministry of National Defence are therefore legitimate. Th e most important of them, specifi ed in the Main Directions for the Development of the Polish
Armed Forces as well as their preparation for defence of the state in the period 2013-2022, are: air defence
(including anti-missile defence), IT systems, and mobility of the land forces (helicopters).

Long-term plans regarding purchases for and modernization of the Polish Armed Forces
should be elaborated on the basis of a complex diagnosis, in close cooperation with representatives
of science and industry. Th ese consultations, supported by real fi nancial investments, e.g. from the
National Centre for Research and Development, will make it possible to harmonize and systematize
defence expenditure for the coming years. Such activities should result in modern products utilized
and exploited by the Polish army both at home and in international security operations.

Th e protection subsystems

Th e main tasks within protection subsystems include the securing of conditions for maintaining the constitutional order, internal stability and public safety. Th ese tasks concern, in particular,
the protection of state institutions, citizens, common and individual tangible and intangible assets
against non-military threats. Such dangers result from both human activities and natural forces. In
the fi rst case, they do not always need to take a form of violation of the provisions of applicable law.
According to the operational strategy rules, tasks in this respect have to be executed both within the
national security system and within the network of international ties, in particular, in the framework
of NATO, the EU and through bilateral cooperation.


-----

### WHITE BOOKTON NATIONAL SECURITY OF THE REPUBLIC OF POLAND

Strategic tasks performed within the protection subsystems concern, in particular, the domains of public safety, combating terrorism and political extremism, as well as threats resulting
from cyber crime, including civil protection.

A complementary objective of activities undertaken within the Polish protection subsystems
should be the participation in promoting internationally and fostering domestically the rules and
awareness of duly enjoying the rights and freedoms of man and citizen.

**Th e judiciary. Th e main function of the judiciary is to settle in a binding disputes between**
defi ned entities. Th e supreme objective of Poland as a democratic state governed by the rule of law
is to eradicate dangers to the liberty of exercising the rights and freedoms, as well as consistent
prosecution and punishment of off enders against the above-mentioned liberty. In this regard, the
state should ensure that courts and public prosecutor’s offi ces function effi ciently, proceedings are
carried and cases are resolved in a timely manner, and decisions are enforced eff ectively.

Another extremely important task of the judiciary is to ensure the security of trade, which is
possible when there are simplifi ed and fl exible legal procedures off ered to business entities.

Th e judiciary has to ensure that the constitutional guarantees of rights and freedoms are implemented. Th is is possible when there is a broad access to judicial institutions which function fast
and in a citizen-friendly manner. Indeed, everyone has the right to a fair and open hearing without
undue delay (i.e. smooth and timely) conducted by an appropriate, independent and impartial court.

A the same time, however, the judiciary has to function in a way which makes citizens realize
that punishment for a committed off ence is inevitable, as well as justifi ed and proportionate to the
scale of the public violation. Adjudication of fi nes for minor off ences, rather than imprisonment, is
advisable. Th e catalogue of punishments, also those for economic crimes, has to be reviewed in order to avoid the impression that the Polish justice condemns minor off ences too severely, and that it
is too lenient for the perpetrators of serious crimes. Moreover, the judiciary should support actions
aimed at promoting and strengthening human rights, the rule of law and democracy.

An important challenge is to strengthen the image of Poland as a well-functioning state governed by the rule of law, supporting and protecting its citizens both at home and abroad. Th erefore,
it is necessary to promote the commitment to human rights and civil liberties; to combat all forms
of discrimination (including the discrimination of Polish citizens abroad), since such activities will
consolidate a positive image of Poland abroad; have prejudices and negative stereotypes humiliating
Poland and Poles eliminated; and to prevent manipulations of history (such as the expression “Polish concentration camps”).

**Counterintelligence shield. Th e strategic task of counterintelligence services is to protect**
the constitutional order and the democratic system of the state against violations of the state’s stability and to operationally identify threats to Poland’s security resulting from the activities of foreign
secret services. Th e latter take, inter alia, steps aimed at gathering information in the areas of business, political, scientifi c and technical intelligence, which may constitute a threat to the security
of the state. As far as the counterintelligence protection of the country is concerned, of utmost
importance is also to safeguard the key strategic information resources, which ensure the proper
functioning of the state.


-----

OPERATIONAL STRATEGY

Th e main tasks of the counterintelligence service should therefore include: eff ective reconnoitring of potential and real threats and preventing them by means of available operational and
procedural methods; continuous monitoring and analysis of identifi ed threats to the security of
the state; taking preventive actions, in particular in the fi eld of protection of secret information;
coordination of activities and cooperation with other components of Poland’s national security system, as well as with foreign and international (transnational) entities, in conformity with allied
obligations.

**Combating terrorism and political extremism. Th reats related to terrorism in Europe are**
connected with the activeness of both the global network of Al-Qaeda and groups of extreme left
(the renaissance of which can be seen in connection with the fi nancial crisis) or extreme right (resulting, among other things, from the rise of xenophobia and anti-immigrant attitudes) nature. Th e
activity of this type of extremist groups may constitute a threat to the political stability of the state,
regardless of whether they are able to undertake purely terrorist activities or not.

Strategic tasks of entities responsible for combating terrorism and political extremism may
be catalogued in the following way: reconnoitring terrorist threats to Poland, both at home and
abroad; continuous monitoring of threats and working out forecasts of likely attempts on the basis
of risk analysis; neutralizing terrorist threats, including physical fi ght against terrorism; eliminating
sources of fi nancing terrorism; prosecuting perpetrators of terrorist threats and acts, in accordance
with the norms of international law applicable in Poland; reconnoitring symptoms of radicalized
behaviour and preventing it; cooperating internationally on political, operational, analytical and
legal levels in the fi ght against terrorism; information struggle aimed at reducing the impact of views
promulgated by extremist and terrorist organizations on the Polish society; anti-terrorism prevention, including shaping the public awareness of the signifi cance of terrorist threats and forming
the appropriate behaviour to increase the security of citizens; constant reinforcement of the state’s
and population’s resistance to terrorist attacks, focused on minimizing material (direct) losses and
psychological traumas (indirect losses), as well as on maintaining the continuity of the state’s functioning critical infrastructure.

**Protection of information. Th e protection of information is one of the most important areas**
of the national security system. In the era of the growing signifi cance of information security, including the vital importance of information collection, processing and distribution processes within
certifi ed information technology systems, the role of cybernetic information security is also increasing. A specifi c domain of information security is the protection of information, i.e. information of
which unauthorized disclosure causes or may cause harm to Poland or would be unfavourable from
the point of view of its interests.

Strategic tasks within the information protection system include the securing of information
security of the state and an eff ective exercise of those of its functions which require processing and
distribution of information via preventing unauthorised access to information and its disclosure,
providing personnel, technical and physical security of information, accrediting information technology systems which serve to store and process information, and exercising tasks related to the
national security authority in order to make possible the international exchange of information.


-----

### WHITE BOOKTON NATIONAL SECURITY OF THE REPUBLIC OF POLAND

**Cybersecurity. Cyber threats concern the interests of citizens, of the state and of business en-**
tities alike. Th erefore, the cyberspace is an arena on which the information struggle is taking place.
Th e most serious threats are related to data theft, obtaining bank accounts access data, the takeover
of control over computers, and DDoS[19] attacks. Th ere have been cases of acquisition of control over
the computer system steering the operation of an industrial facility (e.g. attack on nuclear installations in Iran).

Strategic tasks in the fi eld of cybersecurity are the follows: prevention of threats in the cyber
space; protection of information systems of the state; development of cooperation and coordination
of protective activities with the private sector – above all the banking sector – entities, regarding, in
particular, access to information about the attacks carried out and their types; conducting actions
of preventive and prophylactic character with regard to the protection of citizens against threats
from the cyberspace; identifi cation of off ences committed in cyberspace and preventing them, as
well as prosecution of their perpetrators; conducting off ensive and defensive information struggle
in cyberspace, as well as coordination of activities with other entities of Poland’s national security
system.

Cybernetic threats are underestimated by the majority of the society. Counteracting them requires large groups of specialists equipped with appropriate equipment and fi nancial means to collaborate, and safeguards against the reduction of possibility or failure to use digital data transmission. Th is
cooperation should be closely integrated with the state defence system.

**Law and order. Existence of threats to the public safety and order calls for the identifi cation**
and neutralization of negative phenomena, and if they occur – the reduction of their extent and impact, including eff ective prosecution of their perpetrators. In the context of real and potential threats,
the fi ght against organized crime has to be considered a priority. Although organized crime was traditionally related to criminality and drugs, nowadays it more and more oft en takes the form of broadly-conceived economic crime. Another priority is protection of the public order, also during mass events
and gatherings.

Basic objectives of the state, as far as the infringement of law and order is concerned, consist in
achieving a high eff ectiveness in:

-  the identifi cation of off ences and public safety breaches;

-  the inevitability of punishment of their perpetrators;

-  recovery of lost property and reducing of losses of the state treasury.

Th ese activities have to take into account the need to conform to human and civil rights standards as well as to the democratic rule of law. In this respect, the tasks include:

-  Constant monitoring of criminality with the aim of elaborating and implementing solutions regarding its combating in various dimensions, including a current threat analysis;

-  Conducting current and long-term analyses with the aim of detecting changing trends and tendencies related to threats;

-  Increasing the eff ectiveness of the prosecution of persons responsible for violating public safety and
order, in particular as far as organized crime is concerned;

19 DDoS (Distributed Denial of Service) – attack on a computer system or network service, which aims to prevent it from
functioning by making it overloaded with connections; launched from many computers.


-----

OPERATIONAL STRATEGY

-  Organizing and coordinating activities with the aim of fi ghting against the most serious crimes, in
particular those against life and health, as well as extortions and off ences with the use of weapons
or other dangerous devices;

-  Undertaking actions aimed at recognizing and combating drug-related crime; preventing crimes of
economic nature, in particular those related to the trade in goods subject to excise duty and VAT
frauds, as well as countering money laundering;

-  Intensifying activities aimed at identifying and fi ghting against hooliganism, including the activities
of groups of so-called pseudo-fans;

-  Performing tasks concerning combating child pornography and paedophilia;

-  Ensuring the road traffi c safety by pursuing control activities and analyses of circumstances in
which collisions and road accidents take place; and

-  Undertaking eff ective activities of preventive nature by means of appropriate organization and coordination of tasks; conducting widespread prophylactic activities.

It is important to identify and monitor sources of threats, to neutralize and eliminate them
by introducing changes to the law, as well as, where necessary and possible, carrying out direct
intervention by the authorities responsible for law and order (this primarily refers to a radical restriction of legal means, discretion within the administrative procedures limiting the possibility of
corruption).

Coordination of activities and cooperation with other components of the Polish national
security system, including private entities operating in the security sector (e.g. SUFO), as well as
with foreign and international (transnational) partners, is of utmost importance. In particular, one
can point to: police cooperation within the framework of the Union Area of Freedom, Security and
Justice, as well as cooperation with entrepreneurs, government entities, local authorities and other
public institutions; improvement of the public security system; streamlining of legal mechanisms
and eff ectiveness of the judiciary in combating crime, in particular, organized and economic crime;
protection of the independence of the judiciary and absolute protection of the judiciary against
political pressure; education for security and engaging the people in the process of forming the national security foundations; preventing unlawful infringement of intellectual property rights of the
state and of its citizens, as well as supporting activities aimed at fostering and strengthening human
rights, the rule of law and democracy.

**Civil protection in crisis situations. Th e primary purpose of the state as far as crisis re-**
sponse is concerned is to remain in high readiness and to be prepared at planning, training and
operational levels to promptly react in the event of a crisis menace (individual to citizens and collective to the population and their property). In most cases, eff ective neutralization and minimizing
of the results of disasters require cooperation and coordination of many entities. Enhancing of the
state’s capacity to react in this regard has to concentrate on preventive activities and effi cient operation in case of a disaster.

Concepts elaborated in relation to this domain should emphasize the need to create a universal model of cooperation of bodies, services and other entities performing tasks connected with civil
protection, improving the coordination of the rendered humanitarian assistance and promoting
appropriate behaviours of the society in case of threats. Such comprehensive approach is proposed

within the framework of the National Fire Fighting and Rescue System as an integral element of the
state security system.

Th e strategic tasks in this area include:

-  Current risk analysis and identifi cation of sources of threats to the safety of the population;

-  Elaborating emergency plans including the threat analysis, embracing particularly rules for the use
of forces and means, means of communication, coordination and rules for cooperation of entities
during the emergency response;

-  Protecting life, health, property or environment by dealing with natural or man-made disasters, as
well as eliminating other local dangers;

OPERATIONAL STRATEGY

-  Organizing and conducting rescue operations, in particular, in the fi eld of technical, chemical and
environmental rescues as well as emergency medical service;

-  Monitoring, informing, warning and alarming people and institutions, services and other entities
performing tasks related to civil protection about threats;

-  Preventive, scientifi c and educational activities in the area of civil protection;

-  Organizing rescue exercises;

-  Cooperating with emergency formations and services from other countries as well as with international organizations, and utilizing international cooperation mechanisms related to civil protection.

**Protection of the state border. Safeguarding the integrity of borders is a signifi cant indicator**
of sovereignty of every country. Th erefore, protecting the state borders is one of key strategic tasks
within the national security system of Poland. In order to perform this task, the designated authorities undertake a range of protection activities aimed at preserving the inviolability of borders and the
control of border traffi c.

Th e specifi c character of duties of the Border Guard which executes tasks in this domain has
signifi cantly changed in recent years in connection with the Polish accession to the EU and the joining
of the Schengen area. Th ese changes were primarily connected with the cessation of physical protection at border crossings on those parts of the Polish border which became the EU’s internal borders,
and with the enhancement of controls in those sectors which became the EU’s external borders.

In connection with the requirement of a full implementation of the above-mentioned obligations, a series of concept papers, legislative and organizational changes were elaborated and implemented in order to transform the Border Guard into a modern border-and-immigration service
responsible for carrying out border clearances and protecting the EU external border, and at the same
time performing control tasks in the territory of the country.

### WHITE BOOKTON NATIONAL SECURITY OF THE REPUBLIC OF POLAND

Modifi cations relating to the European integration notwithstanding, the range of strategic
tasks of this formation has not changed much and includes: protection of the state border in such
a way as to ensure the protection of the territory of the Republic of Poland against illegal fl ows of
goods and persons, as well as to prevent hazardous substances and materials from entering the
territory of Poland, which is especially important in the era of asymmetric threats, those related to
terrorism in particular; organization and performance of the control of border traffi c in such a way
as to ensure that it is smooth and, thus, that it has a positive impact on the development of cross-border economic relations; the fi ght against cross-border crime and crime involving foreigners.
Furthermore, as far as security of the state and of citizens is concerned, the Border Guard fulfi ls
the task of backing up the objectives of Polish migration policy. Th e scope of this task is apparently
going to expand. Rescue operations conducted on the Polish sea border are also turning into a more
and more important task performed by the BG.

In accordance with the Act on the State Border Protection, the body responsible for the protection of the airspace of the Republic of Poland is the Minister of National Defence. His duties in
this respect are fulfi lled by the Operational Commander of the Polish Armed Forces with the
help of the air defence command authority. In order to perform this task, the Polish Armed Forces
maintain appropriate forces and resources within a system of standing duty shift s, keeping them in
appropriate readiness for use.

What is more, the Polish Armed Forces are responsible for taking preventive measures if a foreign aircraft crosses the Polish border unauthorized, under the so-called RENEGADE procedures.
In an extreme situation, such as a terrorist attack, these procedures provide for possible destroying
of an aircraft, whether it is a military aircraft or a civilian aircraft on board of which there are no
people or there are only persons who launch the terrorist attack.

Th e broadly conceived state border protection subsystem comprises also the Customs Ser**_vice which does duties related to the protection and safety of the EU’s customs territory, including_**
the legality of goods import and export. By fulfi lling its obligations, this formation has to meet the
expectations of entrepreneurs regarding the assurance of a smooth fl ow of goods, on the one hand
and, on the other, to ensure eff ective control which protects the economic interest of both Poland
and the EU with regard to: performing of activities related to the assignment of goods to the customs
destination; preventing violations of provisions regarding importation to and exportation from the
Polish territory of goods subject to trade restrictions or bans with due respect for public safety and
order or international security, and the fi ght against fi scal off ences.

Th e system of the state border protection also imposes certain obligations on province heads.
Th ey are particularly obliged to permanently keep road, rail, air, sea and river border crossings in
conditions making it possible to carry out effi cient and eff ective security, borders, customs, sanitary,
veterinary, phytosanitary, chemical and radiometric control, as well as to supervise the trade quality
of agricultural and food products.

Th e state border protection subsystem is also connected with the migration system. Th e
**_Head of the Offi ce for Foreigners plays an important role as far as the regulation of issues related to_**
the stay of foreigners in the country is concerned. It is a task which will be more and more important
due to the demographic decline and forecast increase in the dynamics of immigration processes

OPERATIONAL STRATEGY

within the framework of an watchful, clearly defi ned migration policy allowing for an increase in the
population potential of the Republic of Poland.

**Protection of the supreme authorities and public administration bodies. In Poland, tasks**
in this area are performed by the Government Protection Bureau, the principal strategic objective
of which is the “protection of persons and objects important for the good and interest of the state”.
Th is basic task is fulfi lled both within and outside the borders of the country – in direct relation
to persons and objects. Among the most important actions undertaken by the service, one can
mention: planning of the safety of persons, objects and facilities; identifi cation and analysis of potential threats and prevention of their coming into being; coordination of the protection activities
implementation; direct protection; securing objects and facilities, as well as training and improving
working methods of the service.

Fulfi lling these tasks requires a permanent access to resources of credible information which
can constitute a point of reference for planning and implementing protectio actions. It implies
a need for close cooperation with both civil and military (depending on the theatre of the conducted protection operations) classifi ed services. One of the essential conditions for the eff ective
performance of tasks by the Government Protection Bureau is the most optimal introduction of
mechanisms making it possible to use information furnished by the Police, the Internal Security
Agency, the Intelligence Agency, the Border Guard, the Military Counterintelligence Service, the
Military Intelligence Service and the Military Gendarmerie.

Ensuring the maximum protection of Polish diplomatic missions, consular posts and representations with international organizations in places of high social tensions or regions highly threatened by terrorism is becoming a priority. It results from the Poland’s engagement in activities of the
international community, which determines the presence of its representations and representatives
in particularly dangerous regions. Th is requires that the Government Protection Bureau improve
its cooperation with other institutions involved in protection. Actions undertaken by offi cers in the
war-risk zones and ensuring of safety to persons subject to protection who visit countries such as
Afghanistan constitute an additional challenge, since in such situations non-standard procedures
are used, which require elaborate systemic coordination solutions taking into account political and
diplomatic, as well as civilian and military actions undertaken by other services in this fi eld.

An important category of activities related to the protection of the very important persons
of the state is also the planning and implementing of security procedures (not only at the level of
tactical protection provided by the Government Protection Bureau, but also of standing procedures)
concerning locations (co-location) of VIPs, especially in the event of an introduction of the state of
emergency, in time of war and during transportation, by means of air transport in particular.

**Combating corruption. Corruption is a serious threat to the correct functioning of a state.**
Th erefore, combating this phenomenon constitutes one of the main priorities of activities aimed at
ensuring the protection of citizens’ rights and eff ective management of the country’s development.
An eff ective anti-corruption system and an effi cient functioning of services responsible for law and
order constitute guarantors public life integrity. As far as law enforcement agencies are concerned, the
Central Anti-Corruption Bureau, the Police, the Internal Security Agency and the Military Counterintelligence Service are responsible for preventing and combating corruption.


-----

### WHITE BOOKTON NATIONAL SECURITY OF THE REPUBLIC OF POLAND

At the level of public administration, the system comprises the Ministry of the Interior, as well
as controlling authorities, i.e. the Supreme Audit Offi ce, fi scal audit and units of internal audit in public
administration offi ces.

Th e main strategic objective is to curb corruption and corruption-generating phenomena. It
should be fi rst of all realized by means of educational activities conducted at many diff erent levels
(media, school, administration). Strategic tasks of the state with regard to combating corruption are
specifi ed in the document elaborated in 2011 by the Ministry of the Interior and Administration – in
cooperation with other central institutions – entitled the Government Anti-Corruption Programme
for the years 2012-2016, and include[20]: elaboration and implementation of a coordinated national anti-corruption policy; strengthening anti-corruption mechanisms in the public administration (including the enhancement of cooperation and coordination of activities undertaken by law enforcement
agencies and the judiciary, as well as the streamlining of legal solutions); increased participation of
the society, including non-governmental organizations, in the process of preventing and combating
corruption; strengthening cooperation with the public administration and forming anti-corruption
attitudes in the society, as well as fulfi lling Poland’s international obligations related to anti-corruption
prevention and education.

In 2008, a concept of an “anti-corruption shield” was elaborated. Actions within its scope are
undertaken by the Internal Security Agency, the Military Counterintelligence Service and the Central
Anti-Corruption Bureau in cooperation with relevant government departments and their subordinate
organizational units. Th e coordinating institution is the Chancellery of the Prime Minister. Strategic
operational activities include the creation of preventive mechanisms aimed to fend off the corruption
dangers and counter irregularities in two major areas: privatization of key enterprises and the assets of
the Treasury, as well as public contracts worth in excess of PLN 20 million.

**Other protection subsystems. In addition to the aforesaid basic protection subsystems, the**
strategic operational tasks in the fi eld of select activities aimed at maintaining public order, both on
central and local levels, are performed in the following areas:

-  **Civil protection – actions are focused primarily on protecting health against the impact of harmful**
and burdensome factors, and preventing infectious and occupational diseases in particular, performing veterinary checks in trade exchanges and veterinary border control aimed at protecting
public health (e.g. General Veterinary Inspectorate, State Sanitary Inspection);

-  **Rescue – as far as selected activities related to rescue are concerned, an important role is played**
by volunteer fi re departments which struggle with fi res, natural disasters and other local threats.
Specifi c tasks in this area include: activities aimed at preventing fi res and cooperation with the
State Fire Service, local authorities and other entities in this respect; participation in rescue operations conducted during fi res, environmental risks associated with environmental protection as well
as other disasters and incidents; informing the population about existing fi re and environmental
hazards, and about ways of protecting against them; conducting educational activities addressed to
local communities;

20 In 2009, the implementation of the 2nd stage of the “Anti-Corruption Programme – Anti-Corruption Strategy” was completed. On 23 April 2010, the Council of Ministers adopted the “Final report on the implementation of the Anti-Corruption
Programme – Anti-Corruption Strategy – 2[nd] phase of 2005-2009 implementation,” in which one of the recommendations was
to establish a body responsible for the preparation of a subsequent draft government programme with regard to preventing and
combating corruption by the Minister of the Interior and Administration.

-  **Protection of areas, objects or facilities important for the defence, economic interest of the**
**state, public safety or other signifi cant interests of the state – they are** realized by specialized
armed security formations (most of the services they off er are provided in the private sector);
spheres subject to obligatory protection are areas indicated by ministers, heads of central offi ces

President of the National Bank of Poland, the National Broadcasting Council, ministers, heads
of central offi ces and province heads in relation to subordinate, dependent or supervised organizational units;

-  **Road safety and transport protection – particularly control of the compliance with existing regu-**

all negative phenomena related to road transport, and tasks related to the compliance with order
regulations, protection of life and health of people and of property in the railway area (e.g. Road
Transport Inspection, Railroad Guard);

-  **Local safety cooperation and coordination of actions – particularly preservation of law and order**
in public places, cooperation with relevant entities as far as saving lives and health of citizens is
concerned (commune and municipal police, volunteer fi re departments).

3.3. Strategic tasks of national security support
subsystems

Th e societal subsystems

Th e fundamental strategic objectives in the fi eld of societal safety sectors ought to be identifi ed
as follows: creating conditions for the civilization and economic development which determine the
purview of national and state action; creating safe conditions for a decent life of citizens and the development of the nation as a whole, in material and spiritual dimensions, and the protection of spiritual
and material national heritage (natural resources, property of individual citizens and the collective national wealth), including the opportunities ensuring its safe development in all the spheres of national
activeness, especially the economic, social and intellectual ones.

Strategic tasks executed within the societal security subsystems concern particularly: preventing negative demographic trends, undertaking actions with the aim of protecting and strengthening
the national identity, improving social safety of the citizens, improving the level of Poland’s technological advancement and developing the broadly understood education for security.

**National identity. One of the most important tasks of the state in the domain of societal securi-**
ty is to preserve national identity by developing culture and cultivating the national heritage. Th is problem is especially important in the light of challenges stemming from the globalization which, in many
cases, prompts peoples and states as well as, to a lesser extent, social groups, to re-assess within their
identity.

Th e emergence of new phenomena nowadays, such as global mass culture or the European
integration process, force Poland to face new tasks which, in the long term, should be focused not only
protecting the cultural heritage and national identity, but also on liberating their potential for deve

lopment and creation of a modern state. Th e most important tasks in this area include: guaranteeing
universal and equal access to culture; raising the profi le of culture within the structure of administrative tasks, e.g. by increasing the amount of fi nancial outlays; elaborating a policy enabling the use of
the national heritage potential as an element of the state’s development; supporting local associations
and organizations promoting patriotic attitudes and taking care of the national heritage, as well as
working out a new model of cultural patronage.

Undertaking appropriate steps in the sector related to culture will be essential in the light of the
challenges faced by Poland in the context of recently emerged negative demographic trends and the
infl ux of migrants expected in the coming years. Enhancing the national identity should constitute an
integral component of the policy aimed at achieving a stronger identifi cation of citizens with the state.
Strong identifi cation with the motherland might make them rethink their decision regarding emigration. Taking into consideration the signifi cance of social capital, a passive acceptance of brain drain
will result in the dwindling population which, in a long term, can mean Poland’s waning importance
on the international arena.

**Education for security. Current threats to the security of the state and its citizens are more**
numerous and more complex than they were several decades or even a dozen or so years ago. It is
a qualitatively new situation which calls on the state authorities, local governments and non-governmental organizations to modify their approach to the society’s education for security. In this context,
two priority courses of action (implementation of a broadly conceived education for security) can be
distinguished:

-  First, increasing the public awareness regarding the contemporary phenomena and processes which
are the perils, as well as equipping citizens with knowledge and skills which would allow them to
react to the arising threats in a conscious, purposeful, eff ective and rational ways. Th e goal of this

OPERATIONAL STRATEGY

activity is to build a common will and readiness of the social segments of the national security system to support and fi nance it by citizens;

-  Second, increasing the eff ectiveness of activities by the public administration (state and local, acting
collectively and individually) in security matters by systematically and continuously raising the
level of skills in order to obtain high-level readiness and capabilities of forces, services, guards and
administration to effi ciently respond to occurring threats. Th e aim of such activities is to create
professional human resources of the national security system.

Depending on the target group (students, staff of the uniformed public services as well as of
forces, services and guard), the organizer (state, local government, non-governmental organizations)
and implementing bodies (public, private), as well as on the problematic specifi city of the national
security domain, the education for security should take on the form of one of the three following types
of action:

-  Teaching and training on the secondary and upper-secondary levels, organized within the curricula
of the public education system:
a) teaching students about general security and behaviour in case of threats to life and health,
including the acquiring of skills relating to medical rescue and behaviour in crisis situations;
b) teaching students, parents and teachers about communications security, preventing social
dangers and pathologies (peer violence, including cyber violence; drug- and alcohol-related
menaces; safe behaviours near water reservoirs, in the mountains, e.g. during the holidays);
and improving their knowledge regarding criminal responsibility of minors.

-  Training courses within the system of vocational education (improving occupational qualifi cations and skills of the uniformed public services staff, employees of national and local administration, including education-for-security classes’ teachers);

-  Academic courses relating to the integrated national security within the higher education system,
including the vocational preparation at all academic levels of the research staff and employees of
the uniformed public services.

**Scientifi c research and development work in the domain of security. Th e level of Poland’s**
development stage and a balance between development and security are two issues which have to be
included in the scope of scientifi c research and development studies.

First, the technological foundation of the state’s civilization development should be consolidated. Polish science – like the society, economy and other domains – has been and, in the coming
years, will be infl uenced by technological progress which, on the one hand, has contributed to the
modernization of the state, but on the other – has created a trap of excessive imitativeness of technological, institutional and organizational innovations. Th erefore the key course of the currently
conducted research policy is innovativeness. Th is direction should remain the priority in the coming
years.

Second, development should be correlated with security issues, as security and development
are inextricably linked, interdependent (threats to security are simultaneously barriers to development; in turn, development stabilizes security). It concerns, inter alia, long-term harmonization of
the energy, food and environmental security with progress, modernization and technological development of the country.


-----

### WHITE BOOKTON NATIONAL SECURITY OF THE REPUBLIC OF POLAND

Th ere is no doubt that science has an important role to play in this matter. Scientifi c research
and development should be focused not only on the innovativeness and civilization progress, but also
on issues related to the broadly conceived integrated security, especially with regard to social and
economic security. Moreover, the share of the potential of science and research should be increased in
relation to the state security and defence in activities directed towards the creation and development
of systems constituting the foundation of civilization based on knowledge and of integrated economy.
Th e above-mentioned potential not only provides modern technological know-how to the national
security system, but also is a source of numerous innovations and technology transfer to other fi elds,
including the economic and social ones.

Another important course of actions related to research and development for the state security
and defence should be the augmentation of the number of inter-departmental research programmes
and projects. Th is task is more and more important in the context of budget constraints and the
increasing number of demanding requirements regarding eff ective public spending. Research related
to the aforesaid domain should be focused on integrated national security issues and the integrated
national security system which serves to fulfi l tasks in this sphere. Aft er designating an entity responsible for social and economic security, it will be necessary to include these topics into the range of
scientifi c research and development.

**Social safety. One of the most important tasks of the state, as far as the societal security sector**
is concerned, should be to strengthen the sense of social safety, and to prevent the social stratifying
and exclusion, e.g. by providing all citizens with access to manufactured goods enabling them to satisfy
at least their basic needs. It is of extreme importance to support families, also via providing children
with full access to education (kindergartens, public education) and health care. Otherwise, the abovementioned processes may lead to an increase in social discontent, escalating extreme views and intensifi ed claims against the state which, as a consequence, will negatively infl uence the internal security
level and weaken its international position.

In the contemporary world, the state is a guarantor of security, including social safety. Its main
objectives comprise providing the citizens with conditions for having quiet existence. Th e role of the
state in this regard is to create a development framework, e.g. by means of relevant social, demographic
or education policies, which will prevent social stratifi cation and exclusion.

It is also important to develop good relations based on mutual trust between the state and its
citizens. Th e citizens should be certain that in a diffi cult situation they will not be left alone and the
state will provide them with necessary aid. To strengthen the social safety, active citizenship, including
participation of citizens in undertakings of the state, is necessary, which allows them to change their
existing status.

**Demography and security. An important element of the state security should be to decrease**
signifi cantly the number of people emigrating from Poland, particularly those who are young and
well-educated. Th e off er by the state in relation to appropriate working and living conditions should
also be addressed to persons who live currently abroad and who declare their willingness to come
back. Return to Poland or suspending the decision to leave Poland are likely to signifi cantly limit the
adverse demographic trends. At the same time, they will pose a serious challenge for the state, e.g. due
to the increase in the number of persons looking for a job or having problems with adaptation, which
will the case with some of the repatriates, and especially their children.


-----

OPERATIONAL STRATEGY

Th e immigration policy of the state is also important. Within its framework, it is necessary
to intensify activities which could, at least to some extent, meet the expectations of the Polish labour
market, particularly in the domains which will show a signifi cant defi cit of employees. It is important,
however, to take into consideration the fact that the infl ux of immigrants will require, as it is the case
of emigrants, a provision of appropriate working and living conditions, and may generate additional
problems, particularly those of integration related to culture adaptation. Th erefore, the Polish migration
policy should be targeted towards certain groups of foreigners who have the potential for integration
(e.g. cultural proximity) or occupational qualifi cations required in the labour market. People with the
Polish roots should be especially preferred, including scientists and graduates from Polish universities,
as well as members of the families of people who already legally reside in Poland.

In the long run, the essential objective of the state’s policy should be, however, to reverse the
observed unfavourable trend and to lead to a signifi cant increase in the fertility rate, e.g. by means of
an appropriate family-friendly policy and, as a result, a change in the ratio of working-age population
to the post-working-age population. It would have a signifi cant impact on the security of the state,
particularly on the fi nance security, the stabilization of economic growth and the defence sector.

**Social capital. Th e national security system cannot function in a social vacuum. It has to be**
assumed that a high-quality social capital not only increases the chances to fi nd a good job and to
avoid poverty and social exclusion, but is also important in making decisions aimed at sustainable
economic growth, including the need to protect the environment. Without an increase in the quality of
social capital, it will be much harder to make another leap forward in civilization terms, which would
make it possible to catch up with more developed EU countries and to respond to challenges created
by those countries which systematically enhance their competitiveness.

Th erefore, it is indispensable to plan the development of social capital in Poland in a way which
will support objectives laid down in the European Union’s strategy document entitled “Europe 2020,”
particularly the employment growth, the increased level of citizens’ competences and the decreased
poverty level. Th e principal objective, consistent with the provisions of the Human Capital Development Strategy 2020 project[21], is its development achieved by bringing out the potential of people so
they could participate in the social, political and economic life on every stage of their lives.

It implies a necessity for the Polish state authorities to concentrate on supporting the development of social and human capital in Poland by, inter alia, systematically overcoming social inequalities, eliminating poverty and unemployment, enhancing social cohesion and, in consequence, increasing the competitiveness of the Polish economy.

**Health care within the security system. Th e basic operational objective of the health care sys-**
tem is to ensure the continuous functioning of medical entities and the provision of medical services
by the latter in a crisis situation, a threat to the security of the state or war. Th e most important tasks
in this area include:

-  Creating conditions to protect the health and life of the population, including formal and legal,
organizational and logistic conditions;

-  Preparing and maintaining the readiness of the health care system to operate in case of threats to
the state security and war;

### WHITE BOOKTON NATIONAL SECURITY OF THE REPUBLIC OF POLAND

-  Mitigating and eliminating the consequences of threats and reducing the happening of mass losses;

-  Supporting the health care system of the uniformed services;

-  Fulfi lling the obligations of the host state towards allied forces resulting from the Host Nation Support (HNS) programme.

**Media in the national security system. As far as shaping social behaviours is concerned,**
a signifi cant role is played by the mass media which have at their disposal numerous means to reach
citizens with information about a crisis situation in a fast and eff ective manner. Th e modern media
constitute the basic source describing not only the emergence of a threat, but also transmitting possible guidelines concerning steps and behaviour appropriate to face the events that have taken place.
Th erefore, they infl uence the attitudes of their recipients to a signifi cant extent. Cooperation of the
administration and the services with the media should therefore concern principally social awareness
issues regarding appropriate responses to the emerging threats.

Th e task of the mass media in case of a crisis situation or war should be to credibly convey
warnings and information about situations posing a threat and to pursue educational activities aimed
at dissemination of the knowledge concerning proper identifi cation of threats and eff ective reactions
to such situations. Cooperation with the services responsible for security is an extremely important
source of information for both the services and the societ, should a crisis situation arise. Th e responsibility for the performance of the aforesaid tasks should be borne especially by the public media, taking
their mission role into account.

Th e economic subsystems

Th e principal strategic objectives relating to economic subsystems comprise: protection of entities with economic potential against the destructive impact of external and internal threats in peacetime, in the time of crisis and war, as well as fi nancial, energy, infrastructure and material support and
other types of support for the functioning of operational links of the national security system.

**Financial security. Ensuring fi nancial security is related to achieving the best possible internal**
conditions and eliminating existing external threats which can aff ect the economic development of the
state. In the coming years, the most important action regarding this type of security for Poland will be
the strengthening of its fi nancial stabilization, understood as an increased competitiveness, and of the
foundations for sustainable development, as well as a reduction of risk concerning the unfavourable
impact of fi nancial markets on the economy. What is more, the next stage of the internationalization
of economy has to be started by expanding its presence in global markets. Th ese actions should be
manifested by an increase in the export of capital, as well as in the creation and expansion of domestic
transnational corporations.

Th e most important tasks aimed to reinforce the fi nancial security include: fi scal consolidation,
or the reduction of the budget defi cit and halting the accumulation of the public debt, an element of
which are structural changes in spending, and a decrease in its growth dynamics; imposing of fi nancial
supervision on all institutions providing services of banking nature, which will enable to increase the
stability of the fi scal system; acceleration of structural changes in the economy, which will allow to gain
a new competitive edge and create sources of growth; creation of a new system for fi nancing research,

OPERATIONAL STRATEGY

which would connect more closely scientifi c, research and academic institutes with the business world.
Th is is of particular importance in the free market conditions, where small and medium enterprises
dominate. Th ese fi rms are unable to generate adequate means for: conducting their own R&D; increasing the economic awareness of the society by popularizing fi nancial knowledge as well as shaping
social attitudes and behaviour in case of a fi nancial crisis.

As the basic macroeconomic parameters are concerned, it is to be assumed that in the coming
years the doctrine of debt reduction and sustainable economy development will prevail. Under the
pressure of fi nancial markets, Poland will have to adhere to fi scal discipline, in accordance with the
requirements applicable in the euro area.

In a medium-term perspective, the most eff ective protection against monetary and fi nancial
turbulences and at the same time Poland’s strategic objective should be to adopt the common European currency. Aft er the crisis in the euro zone is over, Poland should elaborate a strategy for entering
the euro zone and join eff orts to strengthen the fi nancial discipline as well as coordinate macroeconomic undertakings within the euro zone. In this regard, it is also indispensable to take steps aimed at
reducing the Polish debt, the most important element of which is the budget defi cit and the negative
balance of foreign trade. In the long perspective, the increasing debt of the state constitutes not only
a barrier limiting the development of its economy, but also a way of making the country dependent on
foreign and transnational fi nancial institutions and other states. Th e membership of the euro zone will
augment the importance of Poland among other EU countries, while at the same time ensuring full
participation in the EU’s decision-making processes.

Poland has to strengthen instruments of market supervision. Its Financial Supervision Authority should be able to make sure that foreign fi nancial institutions fulfi l their investment commitments
in Poland. Another aim should be to restrict the outfl ow of capital within banking groups, which
would inescapably lead to limiting the Polish enterprises’ access to loans.

**Energy security. Th e strengthening of the energy security includes a collection of internal ac-**
tions aimed at creating a legal and economic system which would enforce:

-  Reliability and security of supply;

-  Fulfi lment of requirement related to environmental protection;

-  Sustainable and varied structure of energy carriers constituting the so-called fuel balance of the
country;

-  Optimum level of the so-called energy mix, i.e. the diversifi cation of raw material sources consistent
with EU guidelines, given the acceptable level of costs and expected demand related to the projected
development of the country;

-  Geographical diversifi cation of raw materials supplies;

-  Effi ciency of the mining and manufacturing system, as well as of systems of transfer, distribution
and transportation of fuels and energy;

-  Preparation of fuel reserves specifi ed in days and volumes (safety of the demand of end-users and
industry) in the amount ensuring the continuity of supply;

-  Preparation of parameter-based (consistent with the provincial and national plans), detailed plans
related to electricity, heat, gas and water supplies to communes;

-  Economic competitiveness of the energy sector, allowing a stable, innovative and long-term development.

### WHITE BOOKTON NATIONAL SECURITY OF THE REPUBLIC OF POLAND

Apart from internal factors, main external factors have to be taken into account, including:
the energy and climate policies of the European Union; Russia’s energy policy, the political situation
in other countries which have signifi cant deposits of natural resources (petroleum and natural gas),
and particularly the current political changes in the countries of the Gulf, the South Caucasus and the
Caspian Sea; and the rate of development of new technologies, their accessibility in particular.

Energy security of Poland is to a certain extent connected with the Baltic Sea region. In the
coming years, cooperation with the Nordic and Baltic countries will gain in importance. Among
them, an important role is played by Norway which, aft er Russia, is the second largest supplier of
energy resources to the EU countries. Taking into account the universalization of the technologies
of liquefaction of natural gas in Europe, it looks essential to establish closer cooperation with Norway in order to make it possible to transfer Norwegian gas to Poland via the gas terminal in Świnoujście, currently under construction. It seems equally important to continue cooperation between
Polish enterprises and foreign partners with regard to the hydrocarbon resources management on
the Norwegian shelf.

Cooperation with Finland should to a larger extent concern the exchange of experience and
technological solutions regarding the functioning of the nuclear industry and obtaining energy from
renewable resources. Likewise, the intensifi cation of scientifi c and research contacts with Sweden
ought to result in the development of technology regarding the exploitation of renewable energy, primarily in northern regions of Poland, as well as in further integration of electricity markets through
construction of subsequent system connections.

Owing to its geographical connection, Poland can play an important role towards Lithuania,
Latvia and Estonia, as well as the Visegrád Group countries, regarding the diversifi cation of sources
from which these countries can obtain energy resources. Recently, these states have explicitly indicated
the diversifi cation of energy resources supplies as their vested interest.

OPERATIONAL STRATEGY

Poland should, in an eff ective manner, take advantage of this trend not only by developing
intersystem connections related to gas and electricity transfers, but also by increasing the number of
Polish investments in diff erent sectors of the energy market in the region. As far as these activities are
concerned, the opportunity to cooperate with Ukraine should not be left out.

Th e shale gas deposits constitute a chance for Poland. In order to seize this possibility, the Polish authorities need to closely cooperate with the countries (especially with the USA) which possess
the technology necessary to extract this raw material, to oppose any possible attempts to block the
exploitation of shale gas on the European arena, and to strive for having this raw material regulated
by Western companies so as to make concluded contracts profi table for Poland to the largest possible
extent.

Furthermore, cooperation with European countries interested in the exploitation of shale gas
should be strengthened without delay. Poland’s natural partners in this respect would be Slovakia,
Hungary, Bulgaria, Romania, Ukraine and Turkey. Nor can cooperation with Sweden, Denmark and
the United Kingdom, which do not exclude exploiting their shale gas deposits, be ignored.

As the majority of Polish domestic power units is in large measure exploited or has low quality
parameters, their adequate modernization is necessary. Th is process should be an integral part of the
implementation of the Union’s energy and climate policies. Besides, investments in mining, mainly in
the opening of new exploitation levels and the construction of new or the extension of currently used
mineshaft s, are also necessary, as they will help stop the decline of coal mining.

Polish coal mining gains a signifi cant advantage thanks to collaboration with universities and
design offi ces, technical resources, i.e. machinery and mining equipment factories, as well as the managerial staff and specialists working in mines. Th erefore, not only the optimal use of resources
already exploited is important, but also the management of new prospective deposits: Gubin–Brody
and Legnica–Głogów. Th e yield of prospective deposits may rise to the level of 100-110 million tonnes
per year.

At present, it is diffi cult to determine the possible scale of the shale gas extraction. Th is is why
until 2022 Russian Gazprom will supply considerable quantities of natural gas to Poland, although
its dominant position is to weaken aft er 2014, when the LNG marine terminal in Świnoujście will
start up.

It is also planned that in the next years the construction of the fi rst nuclear power plant in
Poland will begin. Th e fi rst nuclear unit is supposed to begin to generate electricity between 2020
and 2025. Th e entire project of construction and development of nuclear energy in Poland is assumed to account for ca. 6 per cent of total national demand for electricity, as well as to facilitate
the diversifi cation of the manufacturing base of the electricity sector and the reduction of carbon
dioxide emissions.

Th e fulfi lment of obligations towards the European Union requires the gross electricity production from renewable energy sources at the level of about 31 TWh in 2020, mainly from wind power
stations and biomass.

Tasks aimed at strengthening the energy security include: stepping up necessary investments
in the energy sector (including the construction of nuclear power plants), as well as conducting an
appropriate policy in regard to the climate package (CO2 aspect); creating competition conditions

in the fuel and energy market; developing an infrastructure for the transmission and use of energy;
eff ective activities of the authorities regulating and supervising companies operating in the fuel and
energy market (URE), the Offi ce of Competition and Consumer Protection (UOKiK); continuing the
processes of restructuring and improving the operation of energy companies; strengthening the environmental security of the state; utilizing rationally accessible, renewable energy sources, and increasing the effi ciency of energy used.

**Safety of the infrastructure, including the critical infrastructure. Effi ciency and smooth func-**
tioning of the country’s infrastructure is fundamental to its economic development and, as a consequence,
to the safety and prosperity of its citizens. Th e most important component of the broadly-conceived infrastructure is the part called the critical infrastructure. It includes key elements and systems which ensure, among other things, the continuous
functioning of the public administration bodies or make it possible to
provide a range of essential services to citizens (e.g. water supply, medical rescue). For this reason, the protection of the critical infrastructure
constitutes one of the most important objectives from the viewpoint of
providing an eff ective operation of the modern state.

As for this fi eld, the role of public administration bodies,
according to their competences, consists in the creation of legal
mechanisms aimed to protect the critical infrastructure and to enforce their application. Owners and holders of such an infrastructure,
regardless of whether they are public or private entities, are obliged
to ensure a total protection of facilities, devices, installations and individual elements of systems making up the critical infrastructure.

Th is protection consists primarily in the elaboration and implementation of protection plans,
also when special threats emerge, and in the maintenance of their own back-up systems ensuring
safety and sustaining the operation of the infrastructure until its complete restoration.

Also, legal protection of the critical infrastructure has to be provided in the course of organizational and ownership changes relating to entities being owners of such infrastructure. Currently,
aft er the privatization transformations which took place over the last twenty years, a signifi cant part of
the critical infrastructure is in the hands of the private sector. Effi cient and collision-free cooperation
between the public and private sector is therefore needed, and within its framework transparent rules
and procedures of collaboration between bodies and services of the state and the owners of critical
elements of the infrastructure have to be elaborated.

Th us strategic tasks in the fi eld of infrastructure safety include:

-  Elaboration and implementation of procedures and mechanisms of cooperation between the public
and private sector, with the aim of eff ective, multidimensional protection of the critical infrastructure;

-  Elaboration of a programme aimed to protect the telecommunications critical infrastructure against disturbances of its operation caused by activities in virtual space (cyber attacks of criminal or
terrorist nature or being a symptom of hostile actions by a specifi c state);

-  Implementation of a legal mechanism which would make it possible to control, block or suspend
decisions of bodies or companies relating to problems regarding, inter alia, hostile takeover, merger
or the sale of certain elements of the infrastructure, particularly those considered critical.

OPERATIONAL STRATEGY

**Transport safety. One of the important tasks of the state in the coming years is to develop**
and modernize the transport (both road and railway) network, as well as to ensure a high quality of
transport services which not only constitute an important element of the economic development of the
country, but are also signifi cant from the viewpoint of the national security system.

Preventing communications and industrial disasters by developing the transport system has
to be considered not only from the economic perspective, but also in terms of the country’s spatial
planning, the natural environment protection and the safety of road users. Because of the scale of
accidents, including fatal accidents and their social consequences, one of the key challenges will be to
improve the safety of transport users.

Strategic objectives in the domain of transport safety include: development and modernization
of the transport network in order to enable performing tasks in the fi eld of the most important national interests, both in peacetime and the state of emergency or war; prevention of communications and
industrial disasters by developing the transport system; enhancing the integration in the domains of
security management and monitoring, rescue, information system and research.

**Natural environment protection (ecological safety). Th e state’s policy regarding the environ-**
mental safety should concentrate on two areas: improvement of the environment quality and preventive activities.

As for the improvement of the environment quality, the following actions are signifi cant:

-  Progressive reduction in carbon dioxide, sulphur and nitrogen, and fi ne dust emitted during energy
generation in order to fulfi l obligations under the treaty of accession and the relevant EU directives;

-  Adopting solutions favouring energy saving and obtaining it from renewable energy sources as set
forth in the Polish new energy policy until 2030;

-  Making steps towards preparations for the implementation of technologies on capturing and storing carbon dioxide;

-  Maintaining or achieving a satisfactory condition of waters by concluding the programme for the
construction and expansion of the wastewater treatment plants and sewage systems for agglomerations within the framework of the EU’s Operational Programme Infrastructure and Environment;

-  Elaborating a water management plan for every river basin; preparing a water and environmental
programme for the country;

-  Reducing the contamination caused by dangerous substances from industrial sources;

-  Increasing the energy recovery from municipal waste;

-  Increasing up to over 50 per cent the amount of recovered waste produced in households;

-  Creating an effi cient system of surveillance over chemicals admitted onto the market;

-  Removing the polychloride biphenyl from transformers and other devices as well as removing asbestos.

As for preventive actions, the priorities should be as follows:

-  Monitoring air, water and soil contamination as well as conducting ad hoc control and measurement tests;

-  Informing decision-making bodies and the population about contamination and alerting them in
case of a particular danger;

-  Eliminating consequences of dangers within the framework of rescue operations;

-  Preventive and educational activities concerning threats related to dangerous substances and actions aimed to restore the environment to its natural state.

**Maintaining strategic reserves. Strategic reserves are maintained with the intention of making**
them available in case of broadly conceived crisis situations. Th ey should therefore be considered to be
one of the most important elements of the system ensuring the security and protection of the state. Th e
main objective in this fi eld is to have the Council of Ministers elaborate and adopt the Government
Programme of Strategic Reserves. Because of the role played by these reserves in the system of broadly
conceived security of the state and the need to spend considerable funds on the purchase and maintenance of the reserves, the formula of a multi-annual programme was chosen. Th e programme will
be prepared for a period of fi ve years and it will be possible to review it every year in case of a change
in the circumstances which constituted the premises for its elaboration. In addition, the adoption of
the Government Programme of Strategic Reserves requires in addition that certain budgetary outlays
are guaranteed in a medium-term perspective for the purposes of pursuing objectives specifi ed in the
programme.

-   *  *

Pursuant to the prognosticated scenarios of the security environment evolution, it was possible
to distinguish three operational strategy options for Poland: the option of maximum internationalization of Poland’s security; the option of strategic autarky (self-reliance and self-suffi ciency); and the
option of sustainable internationalization and autonomy of Poland’s security.

According to the most probable scenario, the main (fundamental) operational option should
preferably be the third one. It assumes that strategic activities for the sake of security should, on the
one hand, be focused on maintaining, as a priority, the country’s determination and readiness to act
in the domains, fi elds and sectors in which allied joint operations may be diffi cult, and, on the other,
on strengthening the international security community, by consolidating the integration processes in
Europe (NATO, EU), as well as strategic relations with the USA and other partners, and, if possible,
selectively participating in the international community’s undertakings based on an explicit international mandate in order to head off the emergence of new threats.

Th ese activities should be taken into account in the course of preparing a new National Security
Strategy of the Republic of Poland, and aft erwards described in detail in the implementing documents:
the Political and Strategic Defence Directive of the Republic of Poland or the Political and Strategic National Security Directive of the Republic of Poland supplemented with non-military aspects, amended
plans for the use of the Polish Armed Forces and other operational plans.

Aft er this process is fi nished, it would be desirable to carry out another National Security Strategic Review.

PREPARATORY STRATEGY

Th is chapter presents a desirable and feasible concept of strategic preparations to be undertaken by the Republic of Poland in the fi eld of security, i.e. its preparatory strategy. Th e latter is understood as a division (area) of national security (state security) strategy encompassing the rules and methods pertaining to the preparation (maintenance and transformation) of a national security system
(the implementation of preparatory strategic tasks in the fi eld of national security) in accordance with
the requirements stemming from the operational strategy.

Strategic Review.

4.1. Foundations and leading theme of the preparatory
strategy

Pursuant to the three operational strategy options presented in the previous chapter, three corresponding preparatory strategy options can be formulated:
1. An option of **internationalization of the national security system, which corresponds to the**
option which involves the maximum internationalization of Poland’s security;
2. An option of autonomy of **the national security system, which corresponds to the option of strategic**
autorky;
3. An option of sustainable integration of the national security system, which corresponds to the
option of sustainable internationalization and autonomy of Poland’s security.

It is the third option which should be viewed as the primary choice that should guide the
formulation of tasks and the development and implementation of preparatory programmes, especially those which entail substantial expenditure. At the same time, however, such programmes should
(especially in their planning and training dimensions) be in readiness to move to the implementation
of possible or necessary preparatory tasks which rather belong in the other two options – either the
more advantageous one or the one which is not advantageous, but the application of which is necessitated by possible negative developments with regard to the strategic conditions of security.

### WHITE BOOKTON NATIONAL SECURITY OF THE REPUBLIC OF POLAND

Th e national security system as a whole as well as its individual subsystems and links should be
prepared for taking eff ective action in three possible variants with regard to the functioning of the state.
Th e fi rst of these variants is a normal operation where the state (or another entity) operates in
accordance with its mission and assumptions and pursues routine activities to make sure that this state
of aff airs is maintained.
Th e second variant is the situation wherein the existing development process breaks down,
with the given entity’s functioning becoming disrupted in one or more of its fi elds of activity. Routine
operations become insuffi cient, leading to an actual loss of control over the situation and the existing
decision-making process is disrupted, with reactions being overtaken by events. Th is state of aff airs
can be described as a state of crisis.
Finally, the third variant describes a situation where the taken actions fail to produce the intended results, and the circumstances make the given entity cease to operate in either of the above variants – averting the crisis and returning to normal operation prove impossible. In such cases the nature
of the entity is prone to change radically. Th e situation in question usually involves a failure, collapse
or liquidation of an entity but may also result in another organizational state which involves system
change. In that case we have to do with a state of emergency. In the case of a state (or a group of states)
an unresolved crisis may also degenerate – in the worst-case scenario – into an open armed confl ict.
Symptoms of likely external and internal threats to national security and development – both those
existing today and those emerging – are diff use, unpredictable and ill-defi ned as to their signifi cance, scale,
direction and the type of entity involved or source of origin. It necessitates the preparation or adaptation
of the national security system so as to adequately respond to a variety of situations in the national security
environment – from those which are local and limited in to those having a nationwide range. An ultimate
system must therefore be prepared in advance as a fully developed, multi-faceted and multi-purpose legal
and organizational system, encompassing all state structures involved in the execution of security tasks,
capable of responding to a variety of threats and, at the same time, designed for quick adaptation, allowing
it to take actions aimed at averting those threats which had not been foreseen earlier.
Th e ultimate objective is the system that must rest on a uniform legal basis, allowing it to be
“adjustable” to a specifi c operational strategy. Such adjustment of the system may be eff ective solely in
a medium-term and long-term perspective, as it requires both time and substantial organizational eff orts.
If a need were to arise for a sudden re-forming of the national security structures, it would mean that the
state was caught unawares. Th is would only serve as testimony to the ineptitude of analytical institutions,
while poorly planned moves to adjust the system would not guarantee an eff ective outcome.

4.2. Preparation of the national security control
subsystem

National security control belongs to the most important functions of the state, intended to ensure its continued existence and development in a constantly changeable security environment.

Th e key function of the managing entity in the national security control process is discharged
– within the scope of the applicable law – by the public authority bodies and the heads of organizational
units performing national security-related tasks, including the command authorities of the Polish Armed
Forces. Control functions are carried out by entities which specialize in executing individual tasks related to
the attainment of security objectives, and operate at all organizational levels of the state


-----

PREPARATORY STRATEGY

Control authorities and their advisory and staff bodies

Th e objective of the subsystem which, thereaft er referred to as the national security control
system, should be fi rst and foremost to ensure the continuity of the decision-making process and
the coordination of activities aimed at maintaining and restoring national security in any possible
conditions and circumstances of the functioning of the state. Th e structure of the national security
control system should be designed in a manner consistent with the universal control model which
encompasses three components: a decision-making entity, a collegial advisory body and a standing
(full-time) body. Th e decisions developed within such structure are subsequently forwarded to the
executive components for implementation (fi g. 36).

Figure 36. Universal control system model

DECISION-MAKING COLLEGIAL
ENTITY ADVISORY BODY

STAFF BODY

EXECUTIVE
COMPONENTS


Th e current national security control system in Poland does not, regrettably, suit the model. According to the Constitution of the Republic of Poland, the function of the political decision-making entity is
discharged jointly by the President of the Republic of Poland and the Council of Ministers – both comprise
the executive branch. Th e President is equipped with both an advisory body (the National Security Council)
and a staff body (the National Security Bureau). Th e Council of Ministers, on the other hand, possesses neither an advisory nor a staff body with regard to the issues of integrated national security. Th e Government
Crisis Management Team and the Government Centre for Security come closest to performing these
functions; their current scope of competence, however, remains restricted to crisis management tasks
and does not extend to national security as a whole.

For the aforesaid reason, in the course of laying down the groundwork for national security control
in the coming years the existing system should be gradually reshaped in order to attain the target structure
presented above (fi g. 37): the political decision-making entity – the functions of which, pursuant to the
provisions of the Constitution, are jointly discharged by the President of the Republic of Poland and the
Council of Ministers; advisory and consultative bodies supporting both decision-making entities – the National Security Council, in support of the President, and a new Council of Ministers Committee for National
Security (or a Government Committee for National Security), headed by the Prime Minister; administrative
bodies supporting both decision-making entities: the National Security Bureau, providing support to the
President, and a Government Centre for National Security, providing support to the Council of Ministers

_Source: authors’ own compilation._

Th e proposed Council of Ministers Committee for National Security (KRMds.BN) should incorporate the existing collegial structures which deal with specifi c security-related issues (the Government Crisis Management Team, the Collegium for Secret Services); its activities should encompass the
analysis and submission to the Council of Ministers of concepts for solution of national security issues
having a supra-ministerial, nationwide signifi cance.

Th e proposed Government Centre for National Security (RCBN) would, in turn, perform, inter
_alia, the following tasks:_

-  Preparing draft strategic plans, concepts and programmes in the fi eld of national security;

-  Supporting the operations of the Council of Ministers Committee for National Security (the head
of the Government Centre for National Security would discharge the function of the chairman of
such committee);

-  Ensuring appropriate conditions for the operation of the Council of Ministers and the Council of
Ministers Committee for National Security in crisis situations or during armed confl icts;

-  Organizing the Central Control Post of the State Defence within the scope necessary;

-  Coordinating inter-ministerial activities for ensuring security;

-  Analyzing and evaluating security conditions and threats to the interests of the state;


-----

PREPARATORY STRATEGY

-  Coordinating tasks fulfi lled by the secret services;

-  Preparing draft documents (guidelines) for international agreements and legislative work pertaining to security issues.

Th e operation of the main control system at times of crisis should also make it possible for the
state to take actions in the event of an armed confl icts for the purposes of controlling state defence.
No signifi cant organizational changes need be made at the strategic management level in the event
of a crisis, except for the “contingency” mode of work of the President and the Council of Ministers.

Solutions to be adopted in the event of an armed confl ict with the direct participation of the
Republic of Poland take on a particular importance. In wartime, the role of the President increases;
furthermore, in such situation it would also turned out necessary to work out guidelines as to the
composition and nature of operations of the Council of Ministers.

During the normal operation of the state, ministers perform tasks in the fi eld of national security within the administrative departments which they control. Th e situation is the same in the event
of a crisis, except that in such cases the importance of those ministers who compose the Government
Crisis Management Team (or the KRMds.BN – if established) is increased. Th e situation undergoes
a substantial change when martial law is introduced. In such a case, the national security control
wielded by ministers designated by the Prime Minister for this purpose, is exerted within the framework of the Central Control Post of the State Defence.

Th e province (województwo) is a peculiar feature of the Polish government system. Th e province
governor (wojewoda), among many competences and tasks which he has as the representative of the
Council of Ministers in the province and as the head of the combined administration, remains the
individual (one-person) authority with regard to the issues entrusted to him as a coordinator of all
activities which encompass the entire province and extend beyond the scope of competence and capabilities of the heads of both combined and non-combined administration. Auxiliary bodies which support the work of the governor, both in an advisory/consultative and staff (assistant) capacity, should therefore
be used for the purposes of performing by the governor their duties in the fi eld of territorial security within
the province (as a part of the national security eff ort), without substituting the competences of individual
heads of administrative authorities operating within the given province.

As in the case of the central level, where it is recommended that an integrated Council of
Ministers Committee for National Security be established, the provinces and local-government
bodies would also benefi t from the transformation of the existing crisis management teams into
broader, integrated territorial security teams (zespoły bezpieczeństwa terytorialnego), responsible for
both defence issues and issues of crisis management – acting as advisory and consultative bodies of,
respectively, the province governor, the district governor (starosta), the mayor, and the head of the
commune (wójt). Th is also applies to their respective bodies (fi g. 38).

Th e advisory staff body supporting the province governor, the Province Territorial Security Team
(WZBT, _Wojewódzki Zespół Bezpieczeństwa Terytorialnego), should take the form of a collegial body_
which, in ordinary circumstances (in the absence of any threats) does not operate on a permanent basis, only convening at regular intervals for the purposes of, inter alia, evaluating the security status of
the province, supporting the coordination eff orts with regard to planning and the organizational eff orts
made in this regard, examining fi nancial issues, determining the directions of streamlining the security
system in the province and undertaking other necessary actions in order to avert any possible threats.
Th e composition of the team, apart from its permanent portion, should be determined according to the
needs and the nature of the given situation. During normal operation of the province and in emergencies

### WHITE BOOKTON NATIONAL SECURITY OF THE REPUBLIC OF POLAND

or during armed confl icts, this advisory entity would operate by holding sessions headed by the province
governor, providing him with substantive support in the course of decision making, the coordination of
the fl ow of information and the implementation of the adopted decisions.

Th e basic composition of the staff body operating within the province should be based on the
personnel of the relevant department of the province governor’s offi ce (including the province centre for
crisis management, operating on a 24-hour basis), acting as the core of the governor’s board which could
be expanded in a manner refl ecting the given situation (also in times of crisis or armed confl ict).

Th e tasks of the staff would include:

-  Substantive management of non-military aff airs which rest within the competence of the province
governor;

-  Analysis and evaluation of the security status of the province on the basis of data provided by other
administrative leaders, including the central authorities, the neighbouring provinces, combined
and non-combined administration bodies, districts and communes;

-  Preparation of variants of solutions with regard to various situations; and

-  Facilitation of the implementation of adopted decisions.

Heads of both combined and non-combined administrative bodies should take on the role
of functional coordinators in the process of planning and organization of interdisciplinary activities,


-----

PREPARATORY STRATEGY

and not just of formal managers of their respective institutions. Leaders within combined and noncombined administration structures, for the purposes of coordinating the functions entrusted to them,
should have at their disposal an analogous management body structure (should the need arise).

Th e underlying concept for national security control at district (powiat) level with regard to
each specifi c variant of the operation of state structures is similar to the solutions proposed with respect to provinces.

At district level, the applicable functions should be discharged by the following entities:

-  decision-making entity – the district governor (or mayor of a city having the status of a district);

-  advisory body – the District Territorial Security Team (PZBT, _powiatowy zespół_ _bezpieczeństwa_
_terytorialnego), comprising the heads of district-level organizational entities competent with regard_
to the planning, organization and performance of tasks in the fi eld of territorial security;

-  staff body – the District Territorial Security Board (PSBT, powiatowy sztab bezpieczeństwa teryto_rialnego), e.g. having the status of a department (section)._

National security control activities at commune (gmina) level has a specifi c set of characteristics which are slightly diff erent than at district level. Th e distinguishing feature is that there are no local
government bodies the scope of activities of which would only extend to the territories of individual
communes.

However, the tasks performed at commune level make it necessary for a control system to be
established at this level as well, considering the capabilities of these local government structures in
terms of organization, human and fi nancial resources. Th e functions of the decision-making authority
are discharged by the head of the commune (wójt) or mayor, who, depending on the needs, would be
entitled to establish an advisory body (the Commune Territorial Security Team, GZBT, gminny zespół
_bezpieczeństwa terytorialnego) and a staff body (the Commune Territorial Security Board, GSBT,_
_gminny sztab bezpieczeństwa terytorialnego)._

Control infrastructure

Th e infrastructure functioning within the framework of the control apparatus encompasses
control positions and centres which consist of technical facilities and devices necessary for the purposes of ensuring an effi cient and secure functioning of control bodies in performing their tasks in
the fi eld of security. One of the fundamental objectives with respect to the preparation of the said
infrastructure is to establish and maintain a system of control positions. Th is system, at every level of it
(i.e. national, province, district and commune levels) encompasses primary and back-up control positions. Within the framework of primary positions it includes buildings and other structures, including
special facilities; stationary and mobile communications systems, including secret communication;
ICT systems, including warning and alert systems, etc., as shown on fi g. 39.
Th e preparation of buildings and other structures, including special facilities, for the purposes
of ensuring the functioning of individual authorities in case of a threat to national security as well as
in wartime encompasses the designation and subsequent adaptation as well as the build-up, when
specifi c circumstances arise, of such facilities and structures. Within the framework of planning and
organization activities, these facilities are adapted for the purposes of ensuring proper conditions for
discharging the functions of the given authority. Th eir adaptation includes, inter alia, the provision of
the necessary communication systems, ICT systems as well as systems aimed at ensuring the security
and “viability” of such facilities, e.g. in case of biological, chemical or radiological threats.

Th e facilities in question should fulfi l a number of criteria which make it possible for the situation to be continuously monitored and enables the given authority to adopt the necessary decisions.
Additionally, proper working and living conditions for the support staff need to be ensured within the
aforementioned facilities.

Stationary (as well as mobile) communications, including secret communications, should enable
decision-makers at every control level to gain access to the necessary information and public administration authorities which are engaged in performing security-related tasks. Th e preparation of these systems
also concerns secret communications and connections, which calls for applying adequate cryptographic
measures. In this regard, it would be advisable to attain the full national capacities both regarding the establishment of the system (design, manufacture of devices, owner’s supervision over components of the
system) as well as with respect to its subsequent usage. Moreover, one should take into account the needs
to ensure the availability of communication channels in cases where the national/territorial security control
authorities need to change their location using various means of transport (air, land and sea), to an extent
which corresponds with their role within the system. Such means of transport should be able to provide the
select individuals with the continuous capability of controlling national security within the administrated
area. Th is also applies to communication services provided for the purposes of armed forces command and
control (including the activities of the Commander-in-Chief of the Armed Forces).


-----

PREPARATORY STRATEGY

Th e usage of ICT systems – including those related to warning and alert systems – utilized
for the purposes of security control needs to be put in order. Th e integration of such systems should
ensure the capacity to exercise control within a designated area (nationwide or at province, district
or commune level), which necessitates the establishment of information exchange platforms and the
elimination of the department (ministry)-based approach.

Th e issues related to the preparation of the national security control system infrastructure are
addressed in the 2004 Council of Ministers regulation. Th e analysis of these issues indicates that a part
of the provisions in question should be elevated to statutory level, which means that they should be
transferred to the proposed act on national security control.

National security control procedures

Statutory regulations need to be put in force with regard to the rules pertaining to the functioning of
the national security control system, possibly as an act on national security control. Such act should precisely
determine the role of the authorities and state institutions within the national security system, including:

-  an unambiguous defi nition of the tasks and competences at executive level;

-  a more precise description of the competences of the President and the Council of Ministers, as conferred
upon them by the Constitution;

-  ensuring the effi ciency in the area of control and coordination of the entire national security control
system, working out the principles of cooperation of the bodies within the system in any conditions,
situations and circumstances of the functioning of the state; and

-  the establishment of appropriate conditions that will enable the Council of Ministers to control the entirety of the issues related to the national security of the Republic of Poland in terms of analysis, concept
and coordination capacity.

Th e proposed act should cover the matters related to the national security control of the Republic
of Poland (today, these issues are governed by the act on the general defence obligation as well as the act on
crisis management). At the same time, the existing legislation and organizational structures should be reorganised insofar as they pertain to the same or similar tasks in the sphere of national security.

It is also necessary – within the proposed act on national security control – to clarify the principles
pertaining to the control of the state defence in wartime, with particular emphasis on the unambiguous
determination of the principles of cooperation of the President and the Council of Ministers in this regard,
as well to clarify the competences of the Commander-in-Chief of the Armed Forces in the context of his
subordination to the President who exercises the control of the state defence.

Furthermore, it is essential to ensure – within new act on national security control – that security is
controlled in a uniform manner at all levels of public administration: national, province, district and commune level. Th e necessary changes include: the universalization of the organizational structure of the management network (including at local level); the rationalization of the number of planning, organizational and
executive structures; the integration – to the extent possible – of the separate crisis planning processes and
operational planning processes pertaining to the functioning of the relevant entities in case of any threat or
in wartime, and, as a consequence, the integration of the planning documentation, in particular at central
level (e.g. the Strategy for National Security of the Republic of Poland, the Political and Strategic Defence
Directive of the Republic of Poland or a possibly extended the Political and Strategic Directive National
Security of the Republic of Poland[22]).

22 Th is document would replace the current Political and Strategic Defence Directive of the Republic of Poland.

It should be considered to what extent the integration of planning processes and executive documents within government administration departments, in central authorities, provinces, districts and
communes into a single security operational plan (for the given administrative department, province,
district and commune) would be practicable. It needs to be taken into account, of course, that the crisis
management planning is performed on a bottom-up basis (starting with threats and capabilities that exist within a commune, then within a district, province and fi nally on a nationwide scale), while defence
planning is carried out on a top-down basis, in accordance with the political concept adopted by the state.

It is postulated that the approach based on entrusting the role of coordinators in the process of
management of a given area of security on a nationwide (comprehensive) scale to individual ministers
be abandoned in favour of having these tasks transferred to a supra-ministerial structure in the form
of a Government Centre for National Security.

Th e recommendations presented above can be implemented within the existing constitutional
framework. Should the appropriate conditions arise and a political consensus be reached with regard
to a possible amendment of the Constitution, it would be worth considering changes to be introduced
with respect to the regulations concerning national security, which would, inter alia, involve:

-  Eeliminating certain provisions which are too detailed to be retained within the Constitution and
to replace them with general constitutional norms;

-  Abolishing the separate post of Commander-in-Chief of the Armed Forces in time of war or at
least anticipating its status optionally. In case this position retains its constitutional status, a legal
possibility should be made for the designation of a functional person who would hold this position
in the event of armed confl ict;

-  Determining in an unambiguous and unconditional manner an authority tasked with the control of
the state defence in wartime. Competences in this regard should not be shared with any other entities (the principle of unity of control in wartime). If, however, the principle, relevant to peacetime,
of cooperation between the two entities (the President and the Council of Ministers) in the state
defence control were to be retained, then appropriate constitutional competences to ensure such
cooperation should be conferred upon the Cabinet Council. Th e composition of the Cabinet Council in wartime should be extended to include the Marshals (Speakers) of the Sejm and the Senate as
potential successors of the President.

If the Constitution were to be amended in a manner aimed at transforming the current system
of government into a presidential or cabinet system, the following actions would need to be taken:
a) in a presidential model – altering the structure of the National Security Council so that it is
transformed from an exclusively advisory entity into a constitutional advisory and coordinating
authority, or, alternatively, transforming the Cabinet Council into an authority of this type;
b) in a cabinet model – abandoning the current constitutional position of the National Security
Council.

-   *  *

Th e main challenge which the national security control subsystem now faces is its complete
integration. Th is integration should pertain, fi rst and foremost, to advisory and staff bodies which
support the activities of the decision-making entities. It is also necessary to establish an appropriate
control infrastructure as well as to comprehensively regulate the national security control procedures.
Th ese components should be guided by the provisions of an act on national security control.

PREPARATORY STRATEGY

4.3. Preparation of national security operational
subsystems

Th e defence subsystem

**Foreign Service (diplomacy) for security. Th e progressing globalization, the growing inter-**
national signifi cance of emerging powers, the increasing importance of international economic and
fi nancial relations as well as the rapid technological development make it necessary to redefi ne the
tasks lying before diplomatic representations and consular posts.

Th e structures, potential and principles of operation of the diplomatic and consular services
need to be adjusted to new challenges in keeping with the adopted priorities of the Polish foreign
policy. Th erefore both the role and the methods of work of the diplomatic corps need to be redefi ned.

Th e consistent, long-term and effi cient implementation of the primary tenets of Polish foreign
policy can only be eff ected by a qualifi ed and apolitical personnel. For this reason, it is essential to:

-  Develop and consistently apply in a practical manner uniform principles of recruiting and preparing candidates for work in the diplomatic services;

-  Elaborate uniform principles of career advancement in the foreign service, including the continuing
education process (culminating with a compulsory examination at the end of each respective stage),
and determine career development paths;

-  Prepare a remuneration model for foreign service personnel, which encourages skills development;

-  Adjust the diplomatic service to the needs of the information technology revolution by introducing
new technologies; and

-  Ensure the durable protection and defence of the state interests through the continuous operation
of impartial, apolitical and competent experts in central institutions (Th is means, _inter alia, the_
exchange of only the political level in ministries should follow the change of government aft er successive election.).

It is worthwhile to consider the establishment of a separate career path for Polish candidates
to the European External Action Service as well as to ensure that the degree of participation of Polish
personnel in the Service corresponds with Poland’s standing and size – especially in locations which
are essential as far as the security of the Republic of Poland is concerned (e.g. in the Eastern Partnership states). It is also important that eff orts are made to ensure Polish diplomats’ representation in the
decision-making structures of international organizations to the maximum possible extent.

**Th e Polish Armed Forces. Irrespective of the possible scenarios regarding Poland’s security, it**
is guaranteed primarily by its own defence potential which ensures the capability of responding to any
form of contemporary political and military threats (blackmail, threats of use of force, surprise short-term military actions by surprise, including air strikes (especially missile strikes), special operations,
border incidents, subversive incursions without an intention of seizing territories, etc.), in relation to
which the capacity of international security organizations to take action is limited.

It is necessary to have the process of the transformation of the Polish Armed Forces expedited, primarily in accordance with the priorities adopted under the decision of the President of the
Republic of Poland, dated 8 November, 2011, on determination of the main directions for the development of the Polish Armed Forces and their preparation for the defence of the state for the years


-----

### WHITE BOOKTON NATIONAL SECURITY OF THE REPUBLIC OF POLAND

2013-2022. Th is document points to three priority directions of organizational change in the Polish
Armed Forces – the organizational and deployment consolidation of the Polish Armed Forces; the
reform of the command and control system; and the streamlining of the training system, including
the consolidation of the military education, as well as three most important directions in the technical
modernization of the Polish Armed Forces: the development of information systems; the development
of air defence systems, including missile defence; and an increased mobility of the Polish Land Forces).

Th e organizational and deployment consolidation is intended to constrain the dispersion of the
armed forces in small garrisons. Th e eff ective implementation of this objective is particularly signifi cant
with regard to the professional Polish Armed Forces.

Th ere is an urgent need to adjust the armed forces’ command and control system at the strategic
and political level to the needs of the professional armed forces and the current political, strategic and
operational conditions. Th e system in question was created in the 1990s, at the time when the civilian control of the military had only begun. Th e number of strategic commands must also be reduced,
with the remaining entities being consolidated around the three basic functions: strategic planning
(the Polish Armed Forces General Staff ), the current general command operations (the General Command) and operational command (the Operational Command). Th e command authorities responsible for the foregoing should report directly to the minister of national defence. Th is should, fi rst and
foremost, result in an increased potential and quality of the long-term forecasting, planning and programming of the future shape of the armed forces, create proper conditions for the necessary training
within the joint operations system and ensure the uniformity of the command system in peacetime, in
a crisis and during armed confl icts. Th e aforesaid issues should be regulated by way of an amended act
on the offi ce of the minister of national defence.

Th e changes which are taking place in the world, and especially their pace, as well as the challenges
which the armed forces are facing today (the need for quick and varied response) make it highly desirable
to establish units with universal (modular) organizational structures – effi ciently commanded and well-equipped units, capable of immediate deployment in any region of operations. It is therefore desirable to
ensure a high quality of training, equipment, logistics and support necessary to respond eff ectively to new
operational challenges and to perform by the Polish armed forces their scheduled tasks. Th e above-mentioned transformation activities are included in the Strategy 2022 on national security system development,
which forms one of Poland’s nine integrated development strategies.

Th ere is also a need to provide the armed forces with equipment in the form of state-of-the-art computerized combat and support systems, used for the purposes of reconnaissance, cyberspace
warfare, command, weapon systems control, precision-guided munitions, remote control of unmanned systems as well as robotic warfare. Achieving this goal requires the decommissioning of outdated
military equipment which should be replaced with weaponry and
equipment that satisfi es the needs of a network-centric operational
environment and ensures compatibility with other NATO armed
forces (the modernization strategy guided by a “generation leap”).
Furthermore, there is an urgent need to attain the capability of the

Archive effi cient surveillance system, coupled with a system of command and


-----

PREPARATORY STRATEGY

target acquisition system. Th e use of the aforementioned solutions will make it possible to attain the ability
to counter surprise attacks, which is crucial from the viewpoint of national defence. Th is capacity should
be additionally reinforced through the maximum mobility of land forces, rapidly deploy able across the
Polish territory, depending on the location of a danger. Such mobility should be primarily based on the
use of helicopters.

An important objective is the modernization of the air defence system, including the building of
a missile defence system aimed to insure more eff ective national security, as attacks from above are the
easiest for the enemy to launch and may reach the Polish territory in a very short period of time. Th e
primary delivery systems today are various types and categories of missiles with diff ering ranges and
payloads – from strategic missiles to the lowest classes of tactical weapons. Consequently, no national
defence can be said to be complete without a proper air defence system. Of equal importance is the need
to provide the armed forces with modern equipment (such as combat and support helicopters) for the
purposes of fi ghting in the increasingly demanding combat conditions (e.g. asymmetrical warfare).

Among the further directions for modernization eff orts one needs to point out the need for
an increase in the potential and resources of the Polish Navy units through the acquisition of modern
weaponry, while concentrating on the protection of the Polish territorial waters, and the capability of
performing the necessary minimum of tasks outside the Baltic Sea (the “Baltic plus” option). In the
course of modernization the aim should be to furnish the naval forces with modern armaments and
equipment, including the national industry potential.

It is also recommended that a national cybernetic defence system be established; such system, encompassing also the resources provided by other government departments – ought to be integrated with similar
systems employed by the allied states. In the future, one of the most important long-term transformation
tasks should also be the attaining of the capacity to use space technologies for national defence purposes.


-----

### WHITE BOOKTON NATIONAL SECURITY OF THE REPUBLIC OF POLAND

As a priority, any new armaments acquired must comply with the criteria related to state security, with an option of being deployable in international operations, while satisfying the NATO interoperability requirements.

Taking into account the scale of modernization needs, it is essential that the level of national
defence expenditure in a long-term perspective remains at the present level of 1.95 per cent of GDP
for the previous year and that approximately 1/3 of the entire defence budget is allocated to the technological modernization of the Polish Armed Forces.

Technological modernization and organizational change in the armed forces must go in parallel with the professional preparation of soldiers as well as commands, staff s and entire formations for
the attainment of specifi c goals. A modern military training system should, to the maximum extent
possible, take into account such preparation of the armed forces which allows them to attain the capabilities necessary on the modern battlefi eld. Th e training must be implemented using state-of-the-art
methods and technologically advanced equipment which, in particular, allows using real situation
simulation scenarios. Th e professional contents of the training process should be based on adequately
updated strategic documents, doctrines, regulations, instructions, manuals, procedures, etc. Th e experience gained during international security operations must also be applied during the training
process.

Th e military exercises carried out at national level must refl ect real conditions created by present-times threats which must be countered and fought back by the armed forces. Th e training programmes must, to the maximum extent, prepare its participants for the performance of tasks related
to state defence. It is also recommended that the exercises encompass the entire defence system, i.e.
involve scenarios which test the procedures of cooperation between the armed forces and other services as well as civilian entities at diff erent levels.

For the purposes of rationalizing the costs of training, the acquisition of military equipment and
armaments must be accompanied by the purchase of appropriate simulation and training equipment.

PREPARATORY STRATEGY

Th e armed forces should, at the same time, participate in numerous international military exercises, the objective of which is to make them accustomed to cooperation and functioning in a multinational environment (including for the purposes of international security operations) as well as to
verifi cation of the effi ciency of allied support should a need arise to carry out a joint defence operation.
As Poland – from the point of view of NATO – remains a border state, it is recommended that such
exercises be carried out within its territory as well, was the case with the 2013 “Steadfast Jazz” allied
military exercise.

As far as non-military defence preparations are concerned, there is a need to determine the
precise scope of responsibility of individual state entities which participate in the defence planning
process at both national and local government levels; the participants of the aforementioned process
should be covered by an education and skills development system. Enhancing the capability of administrative and economic structures of the state to operate in crisis situations and to support the national
defence eff orts is necessary for the survival and the effi cient functioning of the state both in case of an
external threat and in wartime. Th e crucial components of non-military defence preparatory eff orts include: establishment of a national security control system and the provision of logistical and technical
support for such system; meeting the necessary needs of the Polish Armed Forces and the armed forces
of Poland’s allies; defence training and carrying out defence task performance checks; preparation of
enterpreneurs for the fulfi lment of defence tasks; and the militarization of selected public administration
bodies. Th e issues referred to above are currently appropriately settled in legal and organizational ways.
Nevertheless, due to the dynamically changing nature of the security environment, constant streamlining
eff orts are necessary in that regard, including the conduct of systematic, joint exercises involving both
military and non-military entities.

If the Polish Armed Forces are to be seen as an essential part of the national crisis management
system, the effi ciency of the procedures related to the provision of aid by military units (e.g. supporting
the activities of the Police) aimed at expediting the response to crisis situations needs to be stepped up.
Additionally, an increase in the participation of public administration bodies and rescue services in
exercises and training programmes at operational level, carried out by the units and institutions of the
Polish Armed Forces, will allow the crisis management system effi ciency to further improve.

State institutions should also constantly strive for building a favourable image of the armed
forces among the society as an attractive and reliable employer as well as for the reinforcement of the
military service ethos. Th is will allow to recruit the best candidates for professional soldiers as well as
to increase the effi cacy of the National Reserve Forces. Th e support of the professional army should be
provided by the reserve forces, which are rapidly deployable should any threats, both military and non-military, arise in response to the needs of the crisis management process, including actions performed
during natural disasters and aimed at the elimination of their consequences, anti-terrorist operations,
the protection of property, etc. Th e underlying concept of the National Reserve Forces should involve
the establishment of separate, comprehensive units specializing mainly in providing support to the
general public (the so-called “province governors’ army”).

Th e military education system must be adjusted to the modern-day needs of the Polish Armed Forces through their organizational consolidation, with an emphasis on technical education and
education for prospective commanding offi cers. Integrating the dispersed potential of military educational facilities and placing a decisive emphasis on the tasks which are of direct importance for the
armed forces should result in an increased effi ciency of the educational process. It would be advisable
to establish two new institutions of higher education on the basis of the existing potential in terms of


-----

### WHITE BOOKTON NATIONAL SECURITY OF THE REPUBLIC OF POLAND

higher military education; one joint military academy aimed at meeting the needs of the Polish Armed
Forces (a military university) and one institution focusing on national security (an academy of national security), which would operate as a supra-ministerial educational institution and which would
serve the needs of the entire integrated national security system.

Th e streamlining of the military medical care system should encompass the adoption of solutions aimed at restoring the medical corps through the establishment of an adequate recruitment, motivation, education and professional development system. Th ere is a need to improve the mechanisms
related to the functioning of the healthcare system and the applicable legal regulations, including those
regulations which govern the military healthcare service with regard to providing medical support to
the Polish Armed Forces in military missions abroad. Activities linked to the technical modernization
of the military healthcare service should focus on the acquisition and implementation of modernized
medical appliances as well as new equipment and devices enabling the development and streamlining
of the battlefi eld medical evacuation system (including evacuation by air) on tactical, operational and
strategic levels. Telemedicine should be one of the top priorities in terms of modernization.

**Military intelligence agencies. Preparatory activities involving the Military Intelligence Ser-**
vice and the Military Counterintelligence Service – as components of the defence subsystem – should
be closely linked to the process of designing the entire system of intelligence services of the Republic
of Poland (see the chapter on the “Protection subsystems”).

It is recommended that eff orts are made to “reunite” the military special services with the military,
i.e. to incorporate them into the armed forces permanently (both in peacetime and wartime), as opposed
to the current regulations which provide that they will only be so incorporated at a time of war. Adopting
this solution would mean that these services would report exclusively to the minister of national defence,
much like all other military structures do. Insofar as military intelligence is concerned, the solution referred to above might entail the ultimate incorporation thereof into the structures of a new General Staff
of the Polish Armed Forces, exercising functions traditionally associated with this entity (thus returning
to the historical tradition of the Second Department of the General Staff ). Th e purpose of such changes
is to have military intelligence services specialized in, and concentrated on, the tasks related to military
security (national defence) and distinguished from civilian services in terms of both whom they report
to and how they are managed.

**Defence industry. Th e national defence indu-**
stry needs to become more competitive; the achieve

PREPARATORY STRATEGY

In pursuing this objective it is necessary to take advantage of the available instruments aimed
at providing support to the national defence industry, such as: off set instruments, subsidies granted
under the Economy Mobilization Plan (EMP), proceeds from the privatization of the Polish defence
industry as well as the promotion of the armaments and military equipment (AME) manufactured
in Poland. It would be also desirable to improve the government procurement system with regard to
AME by the following actions: advance planning with regard to the conclusion of contracts for defence
products to enable Polish defence industry entities to obtain the orders in question; conducting preemptive R&D activities with regard to those areas which are the most important in light of the longterm needs of the Polish Armed Forces; the initiation of appropriate procedures well in advance; as
well as the improved method of fi nancing of orders relating to defence products.

As from defence sector entities, a particularly valuable development would be intensifi ed activities and improved management of Polish defence industry companies, in order to: gain a better
understanding of the needs of the prime users with regard to AME; diversify and expand the range of
state-of-the-art products as well as improve their delivery schedules, pricing, available warranties etc.;
seek for opportunities to rationalize the assortment and production costs; carry an effi cient search for
opportunities in terms of extending cooperation – in particular with foreign business partners – in the
domain of capital resources, technologies, products, industrial cooperation and markets; modify the
marketing and commercial strategies allowing exports boost a, and concentrate on product development as the primary guarantee of survival on the market in a long-term perspective.

Poland should therefore develop such structural arrangements which will make an eff ective contribution towards attaining a high-quality produce by the Polish defence industry according to the expectations of the Polish Armed Forces, and at the same time attaining a level of competitiveness which will
allow to cooperate – on an equal footing – with both European and world defence companies.

-   *  *

Th e primary preparatory objective of the defence subsystem is to maintain and qualitatively
transform the defence potential of the state, particularly to keep the priority status of the capabilities
which are necessary to ensure the direct security of the state. Th e development of the defence potential
should at the same time be translated into the further reinforcement of NATO’s defence capabilities
and the building of such capabilities by the European Union.

Th e protection subsystems

**Th e judiciary. In order to ensure the full and eff ective protection of human rights in Poland it is**
necessary to have a constant and systematic cooperation of all public authorities whose responsibilities
lie in the area of human and civil rights and freedoms. In particular, it is advisable to have an ongoing
exchange of information concerning the evident violations of human and civil rights and freedoms,
the actions taken to remedy any such infractions and the results of such actions.

In order to allow ordinary citizens to have easier access to the justice system, it is necessary to
continue the eff orts aimed at informatizing the system wherever possible. Informatization, as one of
the primary components of the reform of the entire judiciary, may help fi nd a solution to the problem
of excessive delays in judicial proceedings. Taking maximum advantage of the possibilities off ered
by modern information and telecommunications technologies creates an opportunity for increasing


-----

### WHITE BOOKTON NATIONAL SECURITY OF THE REPUBLIC OF POLAND

the pace of proceedings and the degree of its transparency. An important task should be the practical
implementation of changes which will improve information exchanges between individual components of the judiciary system, including, in particular, between the registers maintained within it
(criminal register, court register). In order to expedite criminal proceedings, it seems necessary that
the option of recording the courtroom proceedings in electronic form be introduced, much as in the
case of civil proceedings. Th is solution would enable an exact record of the proceedings to be accessed
at a later stage, ensuring greater transparency in the activities of the court and the reasoning behind
the decisions adopted by it in individual cases. Electronic recording of court proceedings constitutes
an indispensable component of the process of building trust in the courts among the general public.

It is essential that court proceedings be simplifi ed. In the context of economic freedom it is
necessary to increase the degree of trust in state institutions among entrepreneurs by rationalizing
the application of preventative measures in criminal proceedings, taking into account the guarantees
issued by associations of entrepreneurs with respect to their members, to carry a review of the applicable laws and legal practice with regard to the appointment of judicial experts and the creation of opportunities for educating judges and prosecutors in economics. At the same time, due to the identifi ed
cases of incompetence of state offi cials in the area of applying the law with respect to entrepreneurs, it
is necessary to perform a detailed audit of all cases of power abuse or disregard of duties and, as a consequence, to take criminal or disciplinary action against such state offi cials.

In the context of reforming the Polish Armed Forces it is also worth considering whether the
military prosecution service could be restructured by merging it with the civilian prosecution service.

Insofar as the penitentiary system is concerned, it is necessary to correlate the current criminal
policy with the investments available for developing the prison system in order to allow the Prison Service to perform their tasks effi ciently, both with regard to imprisonment and rehabilitation. Th erefore
one should seek to take maximum advantage of the opportunities off ered by the use of probationary
measures[23], including the usage of electronic prisoner monitoring. It is important that individuals
who have fi nished serving their sentences are aided in the task of re-joining society by helping them
fi nd work or study. With regard to the above issue an option worth taking under consideration is the
introduction of incentives (e.g. tax incentives) for those who decide to employ individuals serving
prison sentences.

In order to ensure the proper functioning of the authorities tasked with the protection of human rights it is necessary to establish and streamline the legal regulations in this respect. In addition,
it is necessary to ensure appropriate fi nancial resources for this purpose in the state budget. Lack of
adequate fi nancing of institutions which form part of the subsystem for the protection of human and
civil rights and freedoms may result in neglecting protection of rights of individuals.

One of the most signifi cant problems is also the absence of adequate legal knowledge and
awareness on the part of citizens with regard to their rights and the authorities set up to protect them.
For this purpose, it is essential, inter alia, that actions be taken to disseminate the knowledge on human rights and fundamental freedoms, also in the school curricula, workshops and classes aimed at
young people. It is desirable that human rights education and anti-discrimination education be considered part of the lifelong learning process.

23 Probationary measures – measures introduced under the provisions of substantive criminal law and criminal enforcement
law which involve putting the off ender to the test, giving him or her a chance to improve his or her conduct in non-detention
settings, with the enforcement of the sentence being suspended in whole or in part.


-----

PREPARATORY STRATEGY

**Secret services. Among the preparatory objectives with respect to the activities of the secret**
services, their adequate organization, equipment resources and training are of particular importance.
In this regard, one of the challenges regarding transformation is to restrict the excessive number of
nationwide secret service organizations. In a model solution there is a case for the existence of 2-4 such
services: 1 or 2 services having a general systemic application (internal and external service) and 1-2
sector services (services dealing with the military, economy or anti-corruption practices). Reforming
the number of secret services as they exist today, however, is a diffi cult task (it is easier to establish
a new secret service than to dissolve an existing one); the political context, inter alia, plays a signifi cant
part in this regard. Th erefore, while a quantitative reform would be purposeful, it should by no means
be considered a top priority. Secret services are a very sensitive component of the national security
system and therefore reforms in this regard must be carried out in a cautious and prudent manner.
Revolutionary changes are ill-advised and any reforms of this type should be introduced gradually.

At the fi rst stage it would presumably be advisable to improve the system of supervision over the
secret services. Th e direct competences of the Prime Minister should solely be restricted to personnel issues
regarding directors of the services as well as the coordination and supervision of the secret services responsible for intelligence and, possibly, for the prevention of corruption at the highest levels of power (if such
service were to be retained as a separate entity; however it would seem more advisable to merge the Central
Anti-Corruption Bureau with the Internal Security Agency. Th e coordination and supervision of other services should be exercised by constitutional ministers (the minister of internal aff airs and the minister of
national defence).

If a Council of Ministers Committee for National Security were to be set up, it should take over the
powers of the minister–secret services coordinator, and in addition, the Collegium for Secret Services should also be merged into the Committee. Th e separate existence of the above entities appears to suggest that
the secret services enjoy a privileged status within the state system, which, in the light of their actual (and,
in the future, possibly also legal) subordination to the relevant constitutional ministers, fi nds no grounds.

In order to ensure the optimum management of information at the highest levels of state administration, it would also be advisable to establish an entity (bureau, centre, department, etc.) responsible for preparation of strategic syntheses of the information provided by the secret services and the
preparation of integrated evaluations for the purposes of national security control. Th e task of such an
entity would be to gather the information from all state services responsible for the individual spheres
of security and its subsequent analysis and evaluation for the supreme authorities of the state. Th e
establishment of the aforementioned institution would make it possible to: ensure the support with
regard to the decision-making process, especially when adopting decisions of strategic signifi cance
for state security; generate a comprehensive presentation of the situation, available solely to the main
decision-makers in the state; prepare relevant plans regard the directions of secret service activity and
improve the exchange of information between the most signifi cant components of the state security
system. Th e cell responsible for furnishing syntheses of strategic information should be established
within an institution providing administrative support to the proposed Council of Ministers Committee for National Security, or within a new Government Centre for National Security, to be located, in
organizational terms, within the Chancellery of the Prime Minister.

Eff orts must also be made towards a meaningful standardization of the problems related to the
operational and surveillance activities of the individual secret services through the unifi cation of the
applied terminology, operational procedures (having regard to the functional specifi city of individual
services) as well as the rules and scope of their coordination. Th e rights of the offi cials of diff erent
services, their operational procedures and their professional codes of conduct need to be unifi ed. As


-----

### WHITE BOOKTON NATIONAL SECURITY OF THE REPUBLIC OF POLAND

a result, it should be possible to effi ciently utilize the human resources of the secret services, on condition that the personnel of individual services will be interchangeable.

Given the increasingly transsectoral nature of security threats it is also necessary to establish
cooperation platforms for the secret services and other institutions to counteract threats having a particular weight for state security (e.g. cyber crime, terrorism, organised crime activities). Th ese platforms
should be maintained in a manner which assumes an evolutionary development of their organizational
forms. An example of such an entity is the Anti-Terrorist Centre (an interdisciplinary entity having a status which might be described as supra-systemic from the point of view of the organizational structure of
the administration), comprising seconded offi cers, soldiers and employees of organizations such as the
Police, the Border Guard, the Government Protection Bureau, the Intelligence Agency, the Military Intelligence Service, the Military Counterintelligence Service and the Customs Service, having online access
to the information resources of their institutions of origin. It is worth pointing out, however, that centres
of this kind should be subject to supra-ministerial supervision (due to their supra-ministerial nature)
instead of remaining an organizational component of any of the services.

Against this background, it is worth considering the proposal to reduce to a minimum the workload of the secret services attributable to duties related to the legal process (these obligations should be
taken over by the Central Bureau of Investigation), concentrating instead on informational and analytical
tasks as well as operational and surveillance activities, i.e. tasks and activities aimed at proving the commission of a crime on the balance of probabilities. Th e obligations of these services with respect to the
legal process should be limited solely to highly specialized tasks related, for example, to proceedings in
espionage or terrorist cases. Th is would allow to adopt eff ective preventative and pre-emptive measures
in areas which are particularly sensitive from the viewpoint of the functioning of the state.

Th e optimization of secret services’ work, their consolidation, the systematization of their competences and the attainment of interoperability between such services may be achieved by the proposal
to elaborate a new act on secret services which would amend the existing legal regulations in this regard. Also worth considering is preparation of an act on operational (or operational and surveillance)
activities for the purposes of unifying and specifying the procedures and competences with respect
to the use of operational and surveillance techniques. Th e draft ing and enactment of consolidated
legislation on the secret services would also form the basis for improving the effi ciency of training and
cooperation as well as for facilitating personnel transfers between these services.

**Institutions for combating terrorism and political extremism. Both domestic and international**
institutions responsible for the analysis and exchange of information on terrorist threats continue to
evolve, especially at strategic and operational levels. Th e Polish system of multidimensional and multi-entity countering of terrorism requires the implementation of more robust, statutory coordination
mechanisms allowing the Anti-Terrorist Centre to eff ectively coordinate anti-terrorist eff orts, both those
which are preventative in nature (staving off terrorist attacks) and those which aim at minimising potential losses. Th ere is a particular need, for adopting legislative regulations governing cooperation between
individual entities to replace the current agreements between such entities.

In order to bring about appropriate response to potential threats, it is important to streamline
the coordinated exchange of information on terrorist threats between the Police, the Border Guard
and the Government Protection Bureau, as well as among the civilian and military secret services and
other services (e.g. the Customs Service, tax audit authorities, fi nancial information authorities). Such
coordination is necessary for the timely transfer of information concerning criminal acts of a terrorist
nature, making it possible to detect, identify, prevent and prosecute such crimes.

From the point of view of establishing an integrated and effi cient anti-terrorist system of the
Republic of Poland, it is essential to develop an algorithm for cooperation and management of activities performed at the scene of a terrorist act as well as the proper implementation of the procedures related to the cooperation of the state services and institutions participating in the anti-terrorist defence
system in case of any incidents of a terrorist nature.

**Cybersecurity-related institutions. In order to raise the level of cybernetic security, it appears**
necessary to coordinate activities, in the fi eld of education and legislation in particular. It also appears
desirable to introduce organizational changes with regard to the currently operating information and
communications technology (ICT) security subsystem. Taking into account the personnel issues with
which many state institutions are coping, one of the possible solutions would be to work out procedures of cooperation, information exchange and coordination of activities followed by the entities
operating in the fi eld of ICT security, which will allow to better use the human resources available to
the given units. Th e above-mentioned activities can include the following:

-  Ensuring that cyclical, comprehensive analyses of the existing level of cyberspace threats carried out.
(At present, selected services produce this type of analyses within the scope of their competences.);

-  Defi ning unambiguously the ICT infrastructure having a critical value for the Republic of Poland as
well as developing a plan and procedures for its protection;

-  Reviewing and, if possible, amending the existing legal acts with regard to their compatibility with the
laws of other jurisdictions and/or international organizations for the purposes of facilitating international cooperation in protecting cyberspace and determining precisely the structural rationality, role,
scope of responsibility and competences, specifi c rights as well as rules governing mutual cooperation
and information exchange with respect to individual organizations, institutions, organizational units,
authorities and services of the Republic of Poland concerning their activities in cyberspace;

-  Performing intensive activities aimed at prevention and raising awareness, in the form of training
courses and public information campaigns which should concern both state administration entities
and – more importantly – ordinary citizens–users of cyberspace on an everyday basis. Th e public
education with regard to these issues is, along with legal and organizational activities and technical measures, one of the most critical pillars of the activities aimed to eliminate the threats which


-----

### WHITE BOOKTON NATIONAL SECURITY OF THE REPUBLIC OF POLAND

occur in virtual space. In this context, it is necessary to increase the level of funds available for the
development of science and research programmes as well as the creation and implementation of
educational programmes for children and young people as a part of the school curricula.

It is also worth considering the introduction of legislative changes which would determine
the principles of active defence of cyberspace as well as organizational changes enabling the adoption
of pre-emptive measures in the fi eld of ICT security by specialized departments within institutions,
organizational units, authorities and services of the Republic of Poland. It would also be legitimate to
build mechanisms and systems designed for taking off ensive actions in this fi eld, also treated as support for conventional measures – especially since virtual space is becoming an area used for hostile
operations not only by hackers or terrorist organizations, but also by state entities.

A review will be needed of the programmes of supplementary training and of the curricula of
higher education institutions being under the supervision of the state (including military educational
institutions) as well as the scope of the planned research or R&D work, taking into account the needs
related to cyber security (with particular emphasis on the safety of state institutions signifi cant from
the viewpoint of the security of the state). Th is would allow to carry out cyclical simulations, trainings
and exercises with the involvement of designated companies and institutions as well as the development of national solutions in the fi eld of cryptography and their wider implementation within the
national information technology systems.

Th e primary state entity responsible for the identifi cation, counteraction and neutralization of
cybernetic threats is the Government Computer Security Incident Response Team (CERT.GOV.PL),
operating within the ICT Security Department of the Internal Security Agency. Th e overall responsibility for issues related to cyber security should rest upon the Council of Ministers, performing its
tasks in this regard through the minister of administration and digitalization, the minister of national
defence, the minister of internal aff airs, head of the Internal Security Agency and the Head of Military
Counterintelligence Service as well as other government administration bodies. If a Council of Ministers Committee for National Security is set up, its scope of competences should encompass a supraministerial coordination of the tasks related to cyber security.

Th e rise of cyber crime calls for equally dynamic countermeasures, implemented in active partnership with the private sector, especially with internet service providers, organizations responsible
for internet security and the suppliers of fi nancial services at strategic and operational levels (industry,
domestic and international). Th is partnership is of great importance for the development of IT tools
that are useful to law enforcement agencies.

**Institutions protecting secret information. Th e system of protection of confi dential information**
in its current form came into being aft er the 1989 political transformation. In its current shape it is the result of the act on the protection of confi dential information dated 5 August, 2010. Th is new act was intended to streamline the system of protection of such information, and, in particular, to eliminate loopholes
such as the in suffi ciently clear defi nition of its subject matter, the too rigid defi nition of the method of
protecting information, the absence of a suffi ciently clear scope of individual responsibility for the protection of secret information as well as the lack of effi cient protection possible against nascent threats.

Every organizational unit tasked with the processing of confi dential information is under a statutory obligation to implement specifi c rules of conduct once the emergency state is introduced. Contingent on the situation, actions should be consistent with the guidelines provided by the entity introducing
the state of emergency. Heretofore, no fi nal decision has been reached with regard to the tasks carried
out by an entrepreneur who holds the industrial security certifi cate in specifi c situations (such as martial

PREPARATORY STRATEGY

law). Th e state services, taking advantage of the laconic wording of the applicable legislation, demand that
an entrepreneur (including the one who only holds a third-degree industrial security certifi cate which
merely confi rms the ability of such entrepreneur to aff ord protection to such information, excluding his
capability of processing such information within the facilities he uses) prepare a plan for the evacuation
of such information. Th is entails a need to pay the relevant service charge (under a contract with an appropriate security contractor), the amount of which depends on the location where the evacuation is to
take place. Th ere are troubles with fi nding a location to which such materials could be evacuated as the
state administration institutions do not accept any such materials for safe-keeping.

It is legitimate to assign the obligations to protect confi dential information at times of crisis
or war to the appropriate province governor (through the subordinate authorities and organizational
entities of government administration and local self-government of the province); such obligations
would include, inter alia: reinforcing the protection of areas which are particularly vulnerable; reinforcing the internal and external access control (e.g. through detailed checkups of vehicles and individuals in cooperation with the police, city guard and civil defence units) as well as identifying locations
to which secret materials are to be evacuated.

Th e information security of the state and its citizens must be strengthened, as the threats
emerge, through a constant enactment of legal regulations and the development of international cooperation within NATO and the EU, with the aim of:

-  Preventing cyber crime and ensuring the safe distribution of information (through ICT systems
and networks as well as other data carriers), and also through education and compulsory training
with regard to the implemented safeguards in order to make sure that the implemented procedures
are properly understood and applied;

-  Raising the public awareness of threats originating from cyberspace;

-  Ensuring that information is monitored at each stage of its life cycle;

-  Appropriately classifying and declassifying information according to relevant procedures, especially for the purposes of determining the level and the moment from which the information in question should be aff orded a special degree of protection;

-  Reinforcing the internal capabilities with respect to ensuring information and IT security with the
aim of implementating eff ective defence measures.

Th e information security of the state should also be increased by enhancing the quality of safeguards for information and IT resources and by popularizing training programmes and awarenessraising eff orts at school education level.

**Public order services and guards. Th e organizational development of the services and guards**
responsible for the protection of the population, public safety and crisis response remains a constant
preparatory objective within the framework of protection subsystems.

It is necessary to precisely determine the responsibilities of individual institutions, services and
guards concerning the maintenance of public order, the rules and procedures they follow in performing their tasks and the areas for which they are accountable. Th ere is a need for sharing out competences between the police, the secret services and guards, eliminating any duplication of eff orts and
forcing the entities in question to engage in actual, as opposed to declaratory, cooperation. Th e absence
of a uniform method of recording, evidencing and comparing the achieved results, in the context of
the overlapping competences of individual services, makes it impossible to evaluate their effi cacy in
an objective and comparable manner. Within the individual areas of law and order there is a need to
designate leaders, i.e. institutions specializing in gathering the knowledge (both theoretical and prac

tical) in the given fi eld and coordinating the activities of all components of the defence subsystem,
protection subsystems and transsectoral areas. Th is applies, in particular, to:

-  Combating terrorism, including the monitoring of international terrorism, prevention, protection
of the critical infrastructure, the training of units earmarked for the active combating of terrorist
acts as well as the methods and procedures of preparing the population for possible terrorist attacks.
It is also essential to verify the legal regulations aimed at combating terrorism;

-  Enhancing mechanisms earmarked for combating organized crime: it is in this context that the ongoing discussion on the organizational and structural changes within the Central Bureau of Investigation of the General Police Headquarters (KGP) should be interpreted. Th ese changes are intended to
increase the autonomy of the Bureau through, inter alia, separating it from the KGP organizational
structures and conferring upon it the status of an organizational entity as well as through providing
it with a separate budget – all changes aimed at enhancing the functioning of the Central Bureau of
Investigation are most desirable from the point of view of the security of the state and its citizens;

-  Combating cybercrime;

-  Improving road traffi c safety. An appropriate diagnosis of the threats existing in this area should
translate into priority directions of the performed activities. It is important that controlling entities
responsible for the performance of individual tasks be designated and that eff ective coordination
be ensured. A good example is the initiative adopted by the Ministry of Transport, Construction
and Maritime Economy, aimed at establishing a National Road Traffi c Safety Programme, based on
a number of primary tenets: establishment of an appropriate infrastructure, eff ective supervision of
the conduct of road users; and an extensive educational actions.

Insofar as combating crime and containing its negative consequences are concerned, the institutionalized forms of information exchange between all security entities should be streamlined
through the establishment of a nationwide crime database. Furthermore, there is a need for a more
extensive dissemination and use of the data obtained through international cooperation as well as
the cooperation with Europol, Interpol, within the Schengen Information System (SIS) and through
liaison offi cers. Th is system should also exercise analytical functions and off er a variety of access levels,
depending on the status of the given user. Th e structure of the system should be built around a database equipped with a search option, modelled aft er the Information Reporting System/Operational
Information System. Th e system should replace the current National Criminal Information Centre,
which in fact contains only the so-called police data. Both the data and the systems used should be
standardized in a manner ensuring the compatibility of data contained in separate registers.

In connection with the extensive catalogue of prohibited acts, which encompasses both violent
crimes – including crimes against life and health – and crimes which solely aff ect property, documents,
security and communication, as well as other types of crimes, it is necessary to streamline the methods
employed for the purposes of combating these crimes, taking into account the multi-dimensional
nature of these threats.

It is necessary to introduce solutions which constrain the phenomenon of criminality occurring amongst habitual off enders in penitentiary facilities by imposing a more direct obligation on the
Prison Service to cooperate with the Police and other services tasked with the protection of law and
order. It should also be whether the Prison Service should be given limited rights to operational and
investigative work, subject to any principles which apply to the rights of prison inmates.

Th ought should also be given to the idea of establishing a platform for public-private cooperation for combating cyber crime, along with elaborating anew the legal regulations governing the rights
and duties of the participants of such platform, designating the sources of fi nancing, determining the


-----

PREPARATORY STRATEGY

rules of domestic and international cooperation (an inter-institutional and cross-border approaches),
along with an estimated quantity of the data processed and indicating the technical solutions for such
platform.

Legal solutions should be developed and implemented to impose upon investors or proprietors
who make construction investments earmarked for organization of mass events, an obligation to install
or equip such facilities with devices designed to detect chemical, biological, radiological or radioactive
threats. Th ere is also a necessity to elaborate legal solutions which introduce an obligation to install at
select train and bus stations a system of monitoring places in which baggage lockers are located as well
as systems which enable to analyze high-resolution video feeds for the purposes of detecting abandoned baggage, entries into restricted areas (security zones), dense traffi c volume (crowds or gatherings
of people), unnatural behaviour of individuals as well as the recognition of vehicle registration plates.
Th e use of state-of-the-art monitoring systems brings about a multitude of new possibilities, such as
the detection of biometric parameters, radiological, chemical or biological materials as well as the
capability to monitor selected contents in cyberspace. It is important, however, that such sophisticated
monitoring systems are not used for the purposes of constant surveillance of all citizens. It is therefore
necessary to start a discussion on a legal settlement of possibilities to use modern monitoring systems,
including the systems used by private entities, as well as providing for the establishment of adequate
control mechanisms to prevent violations of the citizens’ rights to freedom and privacy.

It is legitimate to develop rules of informing the society about the threats posed by criminal activities as well as to the preventative actions, including a permanent information programme intended
to raise the awareness and shape desirable conduct and behaviour in the event of a threat.

Law and order cannot be guaranteed in the absence of a constant and sturdy cooperation between all entities within the system as well as a wide involvement of the society as a whole, promoted as
a patriotic duty. Public authorities should work out a commonly accepted (i.e. transcending any existing
divisions) model for the cooperation with society, based on the general dissemination of knowledge at all
levels of education and professional activity of all citizens. Within this educational eff ort, the following
components are of particular importance: the general school education (introduction to the curricula the
subjects regarding law and order, adjusted to the cognitive abilities of learners and taking into account the
dangers which are typical for individual age groups); the incorporation of security issues into the existing
compulsory health–and–safety training programmes for all employees and students; the imposition of an
obligation upon insurance companies to co-fi nance the general educational eff orts aimed at the society at
large in this regard; the promotion of appropriate civic attitudes with respect to abiding by the regulations
related to law and order; the striving for the allocation of a specifi c minimum part of the central and local
budgets for the purposes of improving the existing security infrastructure.

In a longer perspective, it is worth considering changes in the structure of the state apparatus
responsible for internal aff airs, including the elimination of duplications of certain tasks and competences between the minister of internal aff airs and the commanders-in-chief of the services. According to one of the presented proposals, the general headquarters of the Police, the Border Guard and
the State Fire Service would either be dissolved or transformed into respective departments of the
ministry of internal aff airs, with the corresponding entities at province level to be reinforced. Under
another proposal, the operational tasks performed by the general headquarters would be restricted,
with their analytical and information functions to be extended and the standing of the headquarters
of the aforesaid services at province level to be reinforced. Both concepts have their advantages as well
as drawbacks; it appears that the latter proposal is more in line with the existing situation in Poland,
especially if supplemented by moves aimed at depoliticizing the positions of the heads of the Police

and other services, for example by having them hold offi ce not coinciding with the term of offi ce of
political authorities.

Th e globalization processes and the resulting absence of territorial barriers to criminal activities have made it necessary to increasingly apply innovative technological solutions in the struggle
against crime. It is diffi cult to imagine a modern, well-organized and secure state that does not take
advantage of such technologies.

Th e constant monitoring of technological development – in the context of activities of the services responsible for law and order – is necessary, since criminals also seek to take advantage of new
technologies. Not rarely technological innovations are swift ly and effi ciently employed by organized
criminal groups, terrorist organizations or even by common criminals and youth off enders. Th is is
proven by the growing threat of cyber terrorism and cyber crime.

An important aspect of the contemporary technological solutions is also the ability to confi gure them in a variety of ways and to integrate them within increasingly complicated systems, thereby
increasing their potential and scope of possible uses. Th e objective of such systems may be to detect
specifi c events, especially those which pose a threat to citizens, and, consequently, to prevent criminal
acts and off ences and to aid the process of identifying and tracking down the off enders.

Countering violations of law and order calls for coordinating all aspects of the protection security sector, especially in the fi eld of the prosecution of criminal acts, prevention and, fi rst and foremost,
law-making and the protection of human and civil rights. Th is confi rms the integration needs in the fi eld
of security. Such coordinating functions could be vested in a Government Centre for National Security.

An important preparatory task regarding the operations of services, guards and other institutions responsible for the protection of the population, public safety and crisis management is technical
development. Of late these needs have found an expression, inter alia, in the expenses incurred in the
years 2007-2011 under the modernization programme for the Police, Border Guard, State Fire Service
and Government Protection Bureau. Th e programme pointed to investment requirements in practically
every sphere of activity of the services, from buildings and the infrastructure, through transportation
equipment, vehicles and specialist equipment, to the salaries of offi cers and employees. Both the aforementioned Programme and the spending incurred at an earlier stage have improved the situation in the
services, although there remain signifi cant needs in terms of investments. Ensuring the adequate infrastructure and equipment resources as well as the proper conditions of service and work for offi cers and
employees constitutes a guarantee that their tasks will be performed eff ectively and in a proper manner.

Another component of the system of public order services and formations is the communal/municipal guards. Aft er nearly 20 years of their operation, discussion has begun as to the future of these formations. Certain concepts have been put forward which would extend the scope of competences of the guard,
transforming it into a municipal police sensu stricto, i.e. a type of government-controlled local police, which
would result in the conferral of additional rights, including with regard to their remuneration and pension
privileges. In case the status of the municipal guard were to be elevated, it would be necessary to carry out
appropriate procedures for the selection, training, supervision and establishment of logistical facilities. On
the other hand, there are also proposals for the municipal guard forces to be merged into state police structures, along with the budget funds earmarked for the fi nancing of their functioning.

**Rescue and population protection guards. Th e rules governing the functioning of civil defence**
and the protection of the population should correspond to the challenges faced by the contemporary state
as well as the requirements brought about by Poland’s EU membership. In that regard, the key issue is the
constant improvements in the fi eld of crisis management, protection of the population and public safety.

Th e issues related to civil defence should be regulated in a comprehensive manner in a separate
statutory act, given the scope of its tasks. Th e catalogue of tasks of civil defence derived from the Additional Protocol (Protocol I) to the Geneva conventions on the protection of war victims encompasses
a number of tasks related to the civil population, primarily during hostilities, but also in peacetime in
the case of natural disasters. It is the state which must decide, however, which tasks are to be performed
by civil defence structures and to what extent (e.g. due to the limited economic capacity or human
resources) as well as how to solve the issue of fi lling the positions within the civil defence structures
following the announcement of a general or partial mobilization of the Polish Armed Forces.

Necessary changes should have the tasks related to the protection of the population (as well
as civil defence) properly placed within the state security system and, in this regard, a clear division
of competences of public administration bodies established. All the changes made would result in
a harmonization of the applicable laws and the existing regulations adjusted to modern-day threats as
well as in streamlined responses to normal and extraordinary situations. For this reason, the primary
objectives of statutory regulations should aim at:

-  Unifying the terminology related to civil defence and the protection of the population;

-  Determining the objectives and organization of the system of protecting the population;

-  Determining the principles governing the operation of the system of protecting the population;

-  Raising the level of public education with regard to the protection of the population; and

-  Determining the rules of participation of citizens in performing the tasks aimed at protecting the
population and determining the rules of the planning process within the system of protecting the
population (both in peacetime and wartime).

Statutory regulations should also extend to the rules governing the operation of the system of
protecting the population (including in wartime), which requires the enactment of regulations on civil
defence, as mentioned earlier. In the process, eff orts must be made to streamline:

-  the cooperation of authorities and entities which perform tasks intended to ensure the safety of the citizens, including rescue operations, in the event of local threats as well as natural disasters, catastrophes
and technical failures, through the implementation of qualitatively news legal solutions in this regard;

-  Th e mechanisms for controlling the activities, uniformity of emergency procedures and standardization of equipment;


-----

### WHITE BOOKTON NATIONAL SECURITY OF THE REPUBLIC OF POLAND

-  Th e mechanisms for the coordination of rescue operations as well as other tasks related to the protection of the population; the formation of a coherent model for the training of rescue services and
providing common training facilities to all entities which participate in the system;

-  Th e functioning of rescue dispatch centres, based on the administrative division of the country and
having an identical functionality (this role could be fulfi lled by rescue communication centres –
which are currently being organized – following their appropriate organizational adjustment to the
requirements of the system).

One should mention that the ministry of internal aff airs has initiated the work aimed at the
systematization of the rules pertaining to the protection of the population and civil defence within
the existing legislation. Th e prepared draft bill on protection of the population supports the proposed
concept of covering all the main eff orts related to the protection of the population in a single piece of
legislation so that the concerned entities are given clear guidelines for action.
Th e civilization development as well as the new challenges faced by the rescue services and
organizations in various types of rescue operations have made it necessary to systematize the existing
legal situation in the fi eld of rescue operations and the protection of the population, including the
transformation of the National Fire Fighting and Rescue System into a National Rescue System (Kra_jowy system ratowniczy, KSR). In establishing the KSR, eff orts must be made to have all rescue entities_
operate according to uniform rules pertaining, in particular, to: the notifi cation system; the alerting
system; the organization and coordination of rescue operations; the procedures applicable to emergency rescue operations; the system of rescue training; communications systems for all rescue entities;
the unifi cation of equipment used by rescue entities; the documentation of events; the information
exchange and database systems and the criteria of the effi ciency of their operation.
Th e majority of entities should participate in the integrated rescue system under the provisions
of applicable laws, except for community rescue and humanitarian organizations, non-governmental
organizations and other entities provided for under the response plans. Th e rescue tasks and activities
of the entities participating in the system should be taken on the basis of common rescue procedures
and standards with regard to preparedness, equipment and training. Th is will allow using in a fl exible
manner the existing rescue potential in the event of any foreseeable threat. It is essential to streamline the mechanisms for granting target subsidies to perform the tasks entrusted to public and nongovernmental organizations.
Th e primary tasks of the national rescue system should be concentrated within the district and
take on the form of delegated tasks. At province and national levels, the roles of support or coordination of operations should be played respectively[24].

24 Th e task of forming a National Rescue System and controlling it should rest upon the district governor. Th e standards of conduct should be set by the commander-in-chief of the State Fire Service. Other public administration structures should exercise
supporting functions (for example the province governor ensures the logistical support and reinforcements, while the mayors
and heads of the commune ensure the public base).

In essence, the proposal for the establishment of a National Rescue System would entail the incorporation into that system of
all state services pursuant to the statutory obligations and having these services operate under a single command, which should
translate into the unifi cation of training standards, procedures, equipment interoperability, common terminology, identical
status of offi cers etc. It also off ers an opportunity to link delegated tasks, i.e. legal contracts, to appropriate payments made to
specialized non-governmental rescue organizations (e.g. GOPR, TOPR, WOPR), Masurian Rescue Service (Mazurska Służba
_Ratownicza, MSR) and humanitarian organizations (e.g. Polish Red Cross (Polski Czerwony Krzyż, PCK), Th e Polish Scouting_
and Guiding Association (Związek Harcerstwa Polskiego, ZHP), Scouting Association of the Republic of Poland (Związek Harc_erstwa Rzeczypospolitej, ZHR), Doctors Without Borders), which may provide these organizations with an impulse for further_
development.

PREPARATORY STRATEGY

Pursuant to the above-mentioned principles of operation of the system of protecting the population, the primary objectives of the KSR should be: streamlined response of the rescue entities;
streamlined activity control mechanisms; streamlined rescue tasks coordination mechanisms; establishment of a consistent model for the training of emergency rescue entities; establishment of a uniform
system of requirements with respect to persons participating in rescue operations and rescue service
offi cers; and commissioning of rescue dispatch centres.

In this connection, one should consider extending the draft act on the protection of the population to rescue operations issues in order to create the framework and legal foundations for a modern
system of rescue and protection of the population, the creation of a formal and legal synergy between
activities of the society and the activities of professional state institutions as well as the establishment
of a National Emergency System in order to ensure a functional integration of the area which currently
remains dispersed. Non-defence issues contained in the current act on the general defence duty could
also be transferred to the proposed act on rescue and protection of the population. Th is would also
entail the transferring from the existing act on crisis management, of some of the regulations which
govern control-related issues to the proposed act on national security control.

Th e Polish EU membership also entails the need to reinforce and streamline the cooperation
and coordination mechanisms, especially the mechanisms provided for under Article 222 of the Treaty
on the Functioning of the European Union, with particular emphasis on the following areas: the capacity
to identify threats and their evaluation; keeping of the means and resources which may be made available to the EU in the event of setting in motion the procedures provided for under the article in question as well the ability to start evaluation (as well as applicable procedures) should the EU’s support
must be sought.

**Border services. Insofar as the subsystem of the protection of state boundaries is concerned,**
steps should be taken to streamline the integrated EU/Schengen system for border management. Such
eff orts should result in the designation of main authorities responsible for the exercise of specifi c state
functions and putting in order the competences of individual participants.

Another direction in the process of improving the Integrated Border Management System
in Poland would be the scope of the tasks performed and functions exercised by the Border Guard
extended to the area of activities currently pursued by the Offi ce for Foreigners. Such solution would
optimize the effi ciency of the state with respect to combating illegal migration and would constitute
a continuation of the Border Guard transformation process, aimed at remodelling the Border Guard
into a formation tasked with both border control and migration issues. Th is is because the issues of migration are directly linked to state security, and for that reason they should be dealt with by a formation
of a permanent nature and performing its tasks on an continuous basis.

Th e signifi cance of migration issues should be expected to rise, also as in consequence of the
planned increase in the accessibility of the Polish labour market, which is one of the measures aimed
at mitigating the consequences of the expected population decline in Poland. Th e above-mentioned
eff orts should be correlated with an amendment of, inter alia, the act on foreigners, as well as the development of an action plan and a road map for the implementation of the policy document adopted
by the Council of Ministers, entitled “Th e Polish Migration Policy – Current Position and Proposals
for Action”. Th e plan should contain proposals of detailed solutions along with an indication of the
entities responsible for their implementation as well as the evaluation of costs and sources of fi nancing.

Th ere is a need to ensure a build-up of cooperation between the Border Guard and the consular
services of the Ministry of Foreign Aff airs through, inter alia, increasing the number of liaison offi cers


-----

### WHITE BOOKTON NATIONAL SECURITY OF THE REPUBLIC OF POLAND

operating in Polish diplomatic missions as well as through a more effi cient exchange of information.
Th is would allow, inter alia, to reduce the number of denials of entry issued by the Border Guard offi cers on the external border of the European Union.
Taking into account the current potential of the Border Guard, used for the purpose of tasks
in marine zones, the role of this formation could be expanded within the marine Search and Rescue
(SAR) system, including having the Border Guard take over the overall SAR service duties, as the latter
currently reports to the minister of maritime economy. Th is proposal should be followed by legislative changes, as a result of which the minister of the internal aff airs would become responsible for the
supervision of SAR activities.
It is also necessary to develop and modernize the systems of communications (digital communications) and databases, to carry out joint purchases (in order to take advantage of the economy
of scale) as well as to bring about a broadly-conceived logistical integration within the ministry of the
internal aff airs; another important requirement is the introduction of a common system of education,
e.g. through the establishment of an educational institution (institute or department within the proposed Academy of National Security) which would place an emphasis on the training of management
staff for the individual services.
**Services for the protection of supreme authorities and public administration bodies. Th e**
Government Protection Bureau fulfi lls a number of policing tasks (protection of individuals and facilities, surveillance of the surroundings which are to be visited by individuals under protection). Attention
needs therefore to be given to solutions already applied by other countries, where this type of entity forms
a constituent part of the Police (with the status of an offi ce of the general headquarters), while protection tasks are executed by the local police forces under its supervision. Another option is to retain a unit
consisting of a few hundred individuals, tasked exclusively with the protection of the top-ranking state
persons, with the remaining tasks being entrusted to the Police.
Given the need to ensure the security of the state control system, it is necessary to establish general rules concerning such a dispersal of highest-ranking offi cials (HEAD status of VIPs) while travelling
to diff erent locations that in cases where a number of such persons is present at the same time on board
an aircraft (such rules also pertaining to land and sea transport), the level of reasonable risk for the continuity of control of the primary state functions is not exceeded. It is therefore proposed that a separate act
is drawn up, containing the primary assumptions of the agreement concluded on 10 February, 2011, by
the respective chancelleries of the President of the Republic of Poland, the Prime Minister, the Sejm and
the Senate with respect to air transport arrangements for top-ranking offi cials.
It is important that legal regulations are enacted which provide that the President and the Marshal (Speaker) of the Sejm as well as the President and the Prime Minister ought not to travel on the
same fl ight. Th e Prime Minister should also refrain from travelling on the same fl ight with the Deputy
Prime Minister (or with all deputy prime ministers in the event that more than one deputy prime
minister is appointed). It should also be prohibited for more than half of the members of the Council
of Ministers, the National Security Council, the Collegium for Secret Services as well as the highestranking military offi cials to travel on the same fl ight. It also seems reasonable to prohibit the Marshals
of the Sejm and the Senate from travelling together by virtue of their necessity to remain ready to step
in for the President should the need arise.
Measures need to be adopted to aff ord legal protection to the commander of the aircraft against
any pressure being exerted by third parties. It is also necessary to implement rules pertaining to making
travel arrangements for VIPs using civilian aircraft (introduction of statutory provisions prohibiting the
President, the Prime Minister, the Marshal of the Sejm and the Marshal of the Senate from travelling on

PREPARATORY STRATEGY

private aircraft owned by persons or entities that do not have the status of air carriers). VIP passengers
should be under an obligation to comply with the basic requirements with regard to fl ight safety, i.e.
requirements as to compliance with deadlines and “on-board discipline”, including a mandatory prohibition against accessing the cockpit during take-off and landing. As a result of such legal changes, there
should be a specifi c authority which is legally authorized to enforce the safety rules agreed upon, i.e. the
possibility to call upon the provisions of specifi c legislation in the event that the requirements referred
to above are not complied with by VIPs. It is also necessary to enunciate in greater detail the rules and
procedures pertaining to air transport arrangements for VIPs in such manner that, among the basic factors which determine the performance of the tasks in question (i.e. political exigencies, economic and
fi nancial capabilities, safety requirements), the safety factor is accorded priority regardless of the class of
the fl ight. Th is rule should be included in a new National Security Strategy.
Th ere is a need to establish a coordination centre for air transport safety with regard to top-ranking state offi cials, e.g. within the Chancellery of the Prime Minister, the proposed Government
Centre for National Security or the Government Protection Bureau. It is necessary to introduce an
additional requirement with regard to safety control during the preparatory phase of the operation
prior to the decision-making stage and the fi nal approval for its implementation.
Th e pilot training system needs to be re-examined by placing an emphasis on the compulsory
simulation training pertaining to emergency situations during fl ight. It should be assessed whether it
would be legitimate to establish and organize an integrated system for civilian and military aviation
operations, especially with regard to pilot training and airfi eld infrastructure.
New aircraft need to be acquired for the purposes of VIP transportation. At least two airplanes
and two helicopters need to be fi tted out as airborne state control posts (stations), taking into account
the requirements relating to crisis situations (or the outbreak of an armed confl ict). A list of the posts
of state authority which are critical from the point of view of national security should be included in
the Political and Strategic Defence Directive or the Political and Strategic National Security Directive,
in the section dedicated to the organization and transformation of the national security control system. A back-up airfi eld for VIPs in Warsaw also needs to be provided, in the context of the air mobility
of the strategic state control system – especially in situations of a crisis (or a war).
It should also be considered whether to establish an integrated, supra-ministerial commission
for the investigation of transportation accidents (not limited to aviation accidents).
Th e dangers which exist in the modern world also call for transformation undertakings aimed
at formulating comprehensive solutions regarding the protection of Polish personnel abroad. In the
course of protecting the Polish diplomatic missions, consular offi ces, representations operating with
international organizations as well as individuals working with the aforesaid institutions and Polish
citizens staying abroad in general, there is a risk of personnel isolation (which means that individuals
may for example be abducted, taken hostage or missing). Th ese threats are particularly apparent in
the regions covered by the operations of the Polish military contingents. All this makes it necessary to
establish an effi cient system for personnel recovery.
Due to the constant need for adjusting the forms and modes of operation and protection to
new dangers posed by, inter alia, the dynamics of asymmetrical confl icts, systemic solutions need to be
developed which would allow to coordinate political, diplomatic, military and civilian actions in the
process of personnel recovery. Legal regulations should be enacted which would allow to determine
rules and procedures for inter-ministerial cooperation in the event of isolation incidents concerning
state offi cials, soldiers and employees participating in military operations as well as in case of Polish
citizens being abducted or missing.


-----

### WHITE BOOKTON NATIONAL SECURITY OF THE REPUBLIC OF POLAND

It is also necessary to provide back-up to teams responsible for the security of diplomatic missions in areas aff ected by armed confl icts in which no Polish military contingents are operating, to
determine the rules pertaining to cooperation with local services and services of other states and to
reinforce the cooperation with foreign services of this kind. Th e Government Protection Bureau does
not have autonomous competences which would allow it to designate the scope of long-term international cooperation within this fi eld.
**Other protection subsystems. Having regard to the multi-dimensional nature of the functioning**
of central and local government institutions as well as private entities within the framework of other protection subsystems, emphasis must be placed on the need to take actions aimed at clarifying the respective competences and improving the coordination of activities so that duplication of eff orts is avoided.
Given the number of security service employees (110–150 thousand), the role of the commercial (private) protection sector within the protection subsystems may be taken into consideration.
Th ere are two models which are applicable in this case. According to the fi rst of these models, the state
should not impose restrictions on its own tasks and competences within the fi eld of security, and even
if it allowed a partial privatization of the sector, it should keep strict supervision over it. According to
the second model, security remains a service as any other, and the most that the state should do is to
supervise the quality of the services rendered.
At this point it needs to be pointed out that private security agencies in other countries are
engaged, inter alia, in the transportation of prisoners, the protection of court buildings as well as the
so-called special purpose areas such as military and nuclear facilities. Th erefore the possible benefi ts
from the further privatization of security entities may be tangible on condition that proper supervision
and controls over their activities are strict.
Th ere are obviously many types of risks which must be taken into consideration during the
law-making process; for example, the private security sector operates on a profi t-oriented basis, private
security fi rms do not form a coherent system, being engaged in competitive struggle for their clients,
while the degree of their substantive preparation remains insuffi cient and no regulations exist as to the
obligation to ensure the professional development of the employees of security fi rms. Effi cient verifi cation of security service employees also needs to be improved.

-   *  *

Th e unwavering preparatory objective with respect to the scope of preparation of protection
subsystems within the national security system should be the optimum organizational, technical and
training-related development of services, guards and any other institutions responsible for the protection of the population, public safety and crisis management as well as for ensuring that everyone can
freely enjoy of his/her rights and freedoms as citizens.

4.4. Preparation of national security support subsystems

Th e societal subsystems

**National heritage protection system. Th e broadly-defi ned national heritage has always been**
– and will always be – a signifi cant part of Polish identity as a nation. While during the period of intermitent subjugation and limited sovereignty of Poland (the 19[th] and 20[th] centuries) national heritage


-----

PREPARATORY STRATEGY

formed the cornerstone of Polish resistance against the partitioning/occupying powers and the struggle against them, the modern-day system needs to be based upon new tenets and criteria, encompassing such factors as sovereignty, democratization, relying on strong alliances and organizations in areas
which are relevant from the point of view of security (i.e. political, military and economic) as well as
the impact of popular culture and globalization. Moreover, the latter infl uences off er both an opportunity and a challenge with respect to the task of supporting and reinforcing Polish security. Th ere is
strong tendency among the Polish society to consider these factors threats and compare them to the
eff orts aimed at eradicating Poles’ national identity, which had been made in the bygone days; such
interpretation, however, depreciates the Polish patriotic potential. Th e modern-day model of patriotism should be based upon historic consciousness, perceiving the developments and accomplishments
of Poles as a source of pride; however, it should also be founded on a critical analysis of the deeds and
omissions which resulted in many a failure and defeat of the past.

National identity coupled with openness (stemming from the geopolitical position of Poland), seizing the integration opportunities within the great European family (the European Union) and reinforcing
the national substance in the fi elds of culture, education and knowledge should increasingly be the prominent hallmarks of modern patriotism. Apart from traditional tools such as the protection of historic monuments, national memorials, etc., it is also important to eff ectively and skilfully reach out to the recipients
(and especially to the young generation) by using adequate forms of expression.

All this should be supported by adequate fi nancial means and effi cient promotional activities
both at home and abroad. Th e broadly-defi ned Polish culture, the contribution it makes to the European heritage and its proper promotion via modern media should not only imbue the Polish society with
a feeling of pride, but also generate the interest therein other societies and nations. Such programme
should be developed in an innovative manner.

**Education-for-security institutions. Th e concept of improving the education-for-security**
subsystem should be directed at altering the structure, organization and programme of the process of
education and teaching in this fi eld. It is therefore necessary to adopt a government programme dedicated to education for security and thus increase the effi ciency of this dimension of societal education
(elaboration of the content and form of this branch of education; integration of the activities pursued
by the central and local government administration and by public administration institutions and
non-government organizations in this regard).

Eff orts must also be made to develop the organization of didactic components. A rational solution
would be to establish a supra-ministerial public educational institution – the earlier mentioned Academy
of National Security – which would be tasked with the education and skill development in the fi eld of
integrated security, including its multi-sectoral aspects. Th e work of the Academy would encompass the
coordination of common, supra-ministerial, specialized operations run for the purposes of providing
training for both uniformed and non-uniformed employees of state administration, representatives of
parliament as well as employees of local government administration, NGO activists and civilian domestic
and international students within the framework of the publicly available educational programme.

Insofar as the streamlining of the education-for-security programme is concerned, the role of
NGOs should not be ignored. It is necessary to encourage and intensify cooperation between these
entities and the central and local government institutions, for this will allow the sector in question to
participate, to a greater extent, in the pursuit of societal objectives related to security – both on individual, societal and national levels.

Th e diversity of the entities engaged in spreading the education for security makes it necessary
to establish a single institution to deal with coordination of the scope of activities and cooperation between such entities. Th e institution could, for example, take the form of a unit (department, bureau,
division) tasked with education for security, operating within the proposed Government Centre for National Security which would itself be set up on the basis of the current Government Centre for Security.
Th e unit would comprise representatives of all ministries which participate in the education-for-security
programme, including, fi rst and foremost, the Ministry of Science and Higher Education, the Ministry
of National Education, the Ministry of National Defence and the Ministry of the Internal Aff airs. Th e
unit would elaborate the general objectives and tasks of education for security analyze the condition
of the educational sector and the rules of the system operation, etc. Such a solution would allow the
education-for-security programme to operate on an ongoing, universal basis.

**Scientifi c research and development institutions in the sphere of security. Taking into ac-**
count the evaluation of the current status of scientifi c research and development operations in the fi eld
of security and national defence, a number of areas may be identifi ed that are in need of improvement.
Th ere is also an urgent need to guarantee – within the scope of funds earmarked for science – the
availability of adequate fi nancial resources for the purposes of scientifi c research and development in
the fi eld of national security.

It is legitimate to retain, within the existing structure of basic research fi nanced by the National
Science Centre, a separate thematic panel encompassing the security and defence theory.

It is also essential to work out new solutions regarding the inclusion of applied research “for
the benefi t of state security and defence”, fi nanced by the National Centre for Research and Development, within a single integrated area – national security, comprising defence, protection, societal and
economic dimensions.

Extending the scope of issues covered by scientifi c research and development makes it necessary to establish a body responsible for the coordinated, supra-ministerial policy in this regard. Such
body could take the form of a unit included in the structures of the proposed Government Centre for
National Security.


-----

PREPARATORY STRATEGY

Also relevant in this context is the proposal on establishing a supra-ministerial educational
institution (an Academy of National Security), the scientifi c potential of which could encompass the
issues of integrated national security within a system covering both basic research and R&D activities.
It is also needed to intensify the cooperation of the scientifi c community with the industry and
to direct their substantive and fi nancial eff orts towards projects which would meet the expectations of
two or more institutions (ministries) responsible for security.
**System for counteracting demographic menaces. Re-examining the heretofore assumptions**
of pro-family policies and working out mechanisms facilitating and promoting the raising of children
would be highly desirable. Among these mechanisms, the following deserve to be mentioned: extension of the maternity leave, fi nancial support (including through a system of tax deduction for multiple–children families), labour market incentives for parents, support for apartment buyers (e.g. in
the form of tax deductions, less stringent requirements with regard to loans, reinstatement of support
schemes such as “Th e Family on Its Own” (“Rodzina na swoim”), greater availability of nursery and
kindergarten care as well as eff orts aimed at ensuring appropriate health care level.
In the struggle against unfavourable demographic tendencies it is important to halt or restrict
the process of economic migration among Polish citizens. It is therefore of crucial importance that
conditions be established which will allow citizens to develop their career domestically, e.g. by enhancing
the attractiveness of job opportunities aimed at young and well-educated people, allowing them to
fulfi l their professional ambitions. Additionally, one of the components of state policy should be to
actively encourage those of Polish citizens work abroad to return to Poland.
One of the tools of minimizing the adverse consequences of the demographic decline, but exclusively insofar as to make up for insuffi cient human resources (not only on the labour market) should be migration policy. If well-educated foreigners consider Poland a place attractive enough to move into and take up
employment there, it may be possible to reverse the current tendency. An important issue is to establish an
effi cient system for integrating migrants with local communitieswith the aim ofavoiding xenophobia, social
unrest and resistance like the ones recently seen in some EU states. If one takes into account the statistics
which indicate that the largest proportion of migrants originates from Eastern Europe and Asia, then it is
those regions at which Poland should aim its activities to promote its labour market. It is also advisable to
reinforce the immigration services in order to prevent illegal immigration.
One cannot forget about the Polish diaspora abroad either; encouraging members of the diaspora to
return to Poland may be one of the ways of coping with the demographic threats which Poland now faces.
An institution coordinating eff orts aiming at diminishing the scope of demographic threats
could be the Government Demographic Council. Its powers, however, would need to be extended, for
example by conferring statutory competences upon the Council, since its current status positions it
solely in the role of a consultative body supporting the Prime Minister. It is then worth tapping into the
potential of the Council as it assembles numerous specialists and experts; their knowledge and experience would be used for the purposes of elaborating the concept, providing direction and supervising
the actions taken by competent entities.
**Health service in the security system. Preparation of the health service for uninterrupted and**
effi cient operations at times of crisis and war should concentrate on improving the existing organizational and planning as well as procedural solutions, particularly at the executive and cooperative
levels. Also development of the existing capabilities of the health service should be ensured, taking
into account an increase in the potential and capacity to respond to threats which may disrupt the
functioning of health care facilities and destabilize the whole system (through a mass infl ux of patients,
insufficiency of available medical staff or deficits in drugs or blood reserves)


-----

### WHITE BOOKTON NATIONAL SECURITY OF THE REPUBLIC OF POLAND

It is essential to defi ne clear principles of cooperation and joint action between the Ministry of
Health and the Ministry of National Defence with respect to the state security needs, including cooperation in the event of a crisis. Th ere is also a need to elaborate unifi ed and coherent rules pertaining to
the adjustment (including fi nancing) of health care institutions with the aim of providing health care
to uniformed services.

In order to ensure the security of the state in terms of health care in the event of a threat to state security or in wartime, it is necessary to increase the number of available hospital beds so that there are at least
75 hospital beds available for every 10 000 residents, with 50 per cent of these beds being operating beds,
including beds intended to cater for the needs of the Polish Armed Forces, the armed forces of Poland’s
allies, the authorities and organizational units reporting to the minister of the internal aff airs as well as the
Internal Security Agency. In the course of planning an increase in the number of hospital beds, attention
must be paid to a possible increase in the number of beds in the existing general and specialist hospitals, in
health care centres, residential care facilities, sanatoriums and health resorts. In order to attain this objective,
it would be advisable to have the management of such institutions submit full information on the possibility
of increasing the number of beds, using administrative or social facilities as care units as well as to specify
the requirements in this regard. Following an analysis of the dangers, requirements and possibilities, the
managers of the aforementioned institutions should take action to implement the relevant measures.

It is necessary to expedite a broader utilization of IT systems based on the examination and analysis
of disease symptoms, detecting possible use of biological weapons, using real-time monitoring of behaviours and exercising a support function in the decision-making process. Th ere is also a need to develop an
eff ective system for the detection of smuggling and illegal transfer of biological agents across the borders.

Th ere is a case for reinforcement of military biological monitoring teams. It is also necessary
to create such conditions which will allow, in the event of a crisis, the full utilization of the national
potential in terms of diagnostic operations, inter alia, through the improvement of identifi cation capabilities of laboratory facilities as well as the maintenance of their level of scientifi c expertise by ensuring the participation of their personnel in both domestic and international exercises. Th e location of
laboratories which are being prepared for rapid diagnostic operations should correspond to the needs

of large urban agglomerations. Th ere is also a need to solve the problem of fi nancing the deposit of
reagents used for diagnostic purposes.

It is also necessary to prepare hospital facilities for handling mass casualty events, by performing, inter alia, the following actions: establishing hospital crisis management teams, preparing
response plans in the event of attacks with weapons of mass destruction, organizing regular training
and exercises, and determining the rules of fi nancing such eff orts. In addition, there is a need for
a systematic rise of the level of knowledge pertaining to biological threats at various levels of public administration as well as among the health service personnel and the personnel of other services which
carry out crisis management tasks.

**Th e media in the national security system. Th e execution of tasks by individual subsystems**
(the control subsystem, the operational subsystem and the support subsystem) must take into account
the infl uence of mass media. Th ey are an essential tool for public fl ow of information. For that reason,
the overall concept of making improvements in this regard should focus on developing and deepening
cooperation between the representatives of state institutions and the media which are engaged in the
protection of national security. It is important that cooperation between the administration and the
media not exacerbate the negative consequences of actual or potential threats. Cooperation in this fi eld
should revolve around the supply of substantive knowledge on how to behave and where to turn for
help should the need arise.

Among the objectives which compose the mission to be fulfi lled by the media (and especially
the public media), attention must be also paid to issues of national security in the course of the National Broadcasting Council’s preparation for the subsequent regulatory strategy. Th e additional objective
should take into account an increased of media participation in raising public awareness with regard to
national security, the types of threats which may occur and the methods of preventing them. Of particular importance is the identifi cation of threats to national security as well as the presentation of activities
through which ordinary citizens may contribute to an improvement in the level of national security.

Th ere are also proposals for an extension of the university journalist education curriculum
through the inclusion of a subject which demonstrates the role of the media within the national security system. Attention must be paid to an appropriate technical training of services which establish
contacts with the media so that the information provided by such services is clear and reliable and does
not violate the principles relating to security and offi cial secrets.

-   *  *

Th e key preparatory objective for the societal subsystems is to streamline the principles, procedures and capabilities in the fi eld of cooperation between the components of the said subsystems and
the entities responsible for the protection and security of the state in peacetime, at the time of crisis
and in wartime.


-----

PREPARATORY STRATEGY

Th e economic subsystems

**Financial security institutions. Th e development and improvement of the capabilities of institu-**
tions responsible for the fi nancial security of the Republic of Poland takes on a particular importance at
the time of the worldwide fi nancial crisis. In this regard, the issue which takes centre stage is the need for
implementation of the macro-prudential supervision of the fi nancial system in order to ensure a better
protection of the fi nancial security of the state, including the calling into being of an institution responsible for the restructuring and organized liquidation of banks as well as the inclusion of a representative of
the Bank Guarantee Fund in the composition of the Committee for Financial Stability.

It is legitimate to set up a coordinating mechanism for the activities between the institutions
responsible for the fi nancial stability and security of the state and the appropriate state protection
services, such as the Internal Security Agency or the Central Anti-Corruption Bureau, which would
allow to prevent threats in a complementary manner and counter the emergence of mechanisms which
border on the illegal from the point of view of criminal provisions relating to fi nancial issues as well as
the exploitation of legal loopholes.

It is also necessary to reinforce the fi scal rules and procedures through the introduction of
a rule which restricts expenditure increments and budget defi cit within the business cycle. It should
also make it possible for balance-sheet losses which may occur as a result of the appreciation of the
Polish zloty towards foreign currencies held by the National Bank of Poland, to be covered with the
profi ts gained in subsequent years.

It is also important to reinforce the stability of the banking system in Poland, primarily through
the continuing growth of the capital base of banks as well as through the diversifi cation of their sources
of fi nancing and the lessening of the share of loans, especially in foreign currencies, which are off ered by
these banks. It is also desirable to expand the control powers of the Polish Financial Supervision Authority
so that they cover all fi nancial institutions as well as to embolden the activeness of and intensify steps
by the judiciary against entities the actions of which pose a danger to investors or the economy as such.

**Energy security entities. Th e concept of preparing the energy security entities for the effi cient**
performance of their tasks should encompass both regulatory, organizational and investment (fi nancial) steps.

Th e Polish Energy Policy until 2030 needs to be extended and supplemented with the missing analyses pertaining to the exploitation of shale gas, including the intensifi cation of inter-ministerial coordination
and communication within the energy security policy. Th ere are also postulates regarding the preparation of
a long-term strategy pertaining to the rules governing the exploitation of geological resources.

Measures need to be adopted which will ensure that the State Treasury retains control over those
energy companies which are of key importance from the point of view of state security. Equally important is
obligate the province authorities to draw up applicable energy security strategies at the province level which
will correspond with the nationwide strategy in this regard, as well as to include in the crisis management
plan measures aimed at responding to system-wide malfunctions in the given province.

Th ere is a need to extend the powers of the Geological Service to include the supervision and
control of geological resources of the state as well as to enlarge the scope of supervision and control
of processes related to the allocation of licences for the exploitation of Polish raw material resources.

Other desirable developments include: the diversifi cation of energy resources supply and the diversifi cation of production structures as well as the build-up of the capacity of liquid fuel storage facilities.


-----

### WHITE BOOKTON NATIONAL SECURITY OF THE REPUBLIC OF POLAND

Furthermore, over the next few years, the intensive modernization and development of energy
production facilities and transmission networks are to continue in order to enhance the reliability of
power supply and the usage of electricity reserves.

**Critical infrastructure security institutions. Th e fundamental objectives of the activities pur-**
sued with regard to the protection of critical infrastructure facilities should be as follows:

-  Increasing the security level of the critical infrastructure by increasing its resilience (i.e. reducing
vulnerability) to threats;

-  Integrating (or at least increasing the interoperability and complementarity) with other security
programmes (systems), e.g. those operated under the provisions of the Telecommunications Act;

-  Integrating the state’s critical infrastructure protection systems; and

-  Designating a single entity responsible for the planning and programming issues in the fi eld of the
critical state infrastructure protection.

Th e following activities are also recommended:

-  Ensuring more favourable conditions for enterprises willing to invest in security measures;

-  Introducing a clear division between items of the critical infrastructure at central and regional levels;

-  Introducing uniform regulations pertaining to the protection of the critical state infrastructure, i.e.
all such regulations should be drawn up in a single piece of legislation;

-  Unifying the approach to the issues related to critical infrastructure security (facilities, equipment
and areas).

Th e criteria for qualifying individual items of the critical infrastructure in Poland need to be
verifi ed, taking into account the diff erentiation of the types and levels of such infrastructure as provided for in the EU directives, ensuring the appropriate levels of national defence and security as well
as the meeting the needs of the safe functioning of the provinces (the option of designating critical
infrastructure at the level of individual districts and large cities may also be considered). One of the
foundations of such verifi cation should be the fact that the infrastructure in question has been included in the Defence Response Plan, the Economy Mobilization Plan as well as the Crisis Management
Plan at national, province or other level, etc.

**Strategic reserves. In accordance with the provisions of Polish law, strategic reserves are created,**
_inter alia, in the event of necessity to defend the territory of the state, possible threats to state security,_
health and public order, natural disasters, eff orts to mitigate interruptions in the continuity of supplies
necessary to ensure the functioning of the economy and to satisfy the basic needs of citizens as well as to
protect the life and health of citizens. Th e scope of strategic reserves as well as the types of products to be
included are determined in the government strategic reserve programme, drawn up by the minister of
the economy in cooperation, inter alia, with the minister of national defence, the minister of the internal
aff airs, the minister of health and the minister of transportation, construction and maritime economy.

At present, the solutions applied to the strategic reserve subsystem take into account the changes
with respect to threats to state security as well as to the international and macroeconomic environment. Th e simplifi cation of the reserve system and the unifi cation of procedures have a direct bearing
upon expediting the decision-making process as well as improving the effi ciency of activities related to
the maintenance of the reserves. Th e critical challenge will be to adopt a government programme for
strategic reserves by the Council of Ministers and ensure its fi nancing from the state budget at a level
enabling the pursuit of objectives planned in a 5-year perspective.


-----

PREPARATORY STRATEGY

**Environmental protection system. Insofar as the protection of the natural environment is**
concerned, there is a need for decisive action. Of particular importance is to reinforce the supervision
of the installations the failure of which may pose a substantial danger to the environment (the Inspectorate for Environmental Protection) through the extension of the register of monitored facilities. Of
similar importance are eff orts aimed at increasing the effi ciency of the international system for the
notifi cation of failures. Th e recommended course of action would be to draw up a long-term strategy
for the exploitation of the national hydrological (water) resources.

Th ere is a need to develop health risk analysis regulations for the procedures relating to: the
approval for implementation of investment projects; improvement of the functioning of the state environmental and sanitation monitoring system by providing the appropriate control services with modern equipment and alerting networks; and, fi nally, joint activities of the Chief Sanitary Inspectorate
and the Inspectorate for Environmental Protection in order to improve the quality of drinking water
and the joint conducting of educational and training campaigns for the services operating at industrial
facilities and for public administration employees, concerning the prevention of technical failures and
contamination of the environment. It is also necessary to provide the Fire Service with additional
chemical and environmental rescue equipment and to draw up plans regarding the management of
risks related to failures.

Responding to industrial accidents requires increasing the societal awareness regarding the
threats related to the production, transportation and use of hazardous materials as well as the preparation, in cooperation with local communities, of emergency response plans. Th is will apply in particular
to advance warnings pertaining to nuclear incidents.

Ensuring environmental safety also requires an intensive international cooperation regarding
both the consolidation of legal foundations and the development of practical cooperation mechanisms
in the event of a danger, including rapid information exchange and cooperation in mutual aid and R&D
operations aimed at preventing possible threats. In this context, the activities pursued by Poland should
encompass the support for international organizations and agreements pertaining to the global climate
policy respecting the development level and structure of the national economies of participating states.

In sum, the important preparatory objective for economic subsystems is to work out adequate
strategies and programmes concerning the preparation (i.e. maintenance and improvement) of state
economic entities for operations in situations of danger, including undertaking the tasks of operational
support for the individual components of the national security system.

-   *  *

Th is chapter has presented a model of state structures pursuing state security objectives as well
as relations between these structures within the framework of the option of sustainable integration
of the national security system. Th e option provides for such an organization of the national security
system which would ensure its internal consistency, balance and integrative nature, thus allowing to
combine individual entities and relations between them into a legally and functionally harmonized
national security system.

Th e need now arises to introduce changes into the existing legal regulations at two levels: the
**administrative level, which remains within the competence of individual authorities and institutions,**
as well as **the legislative level, relating to system-wide solutions the responsibility for which rests**


-----

### WHITE BOOKTON NATIONAL SECURITY OF THE REPUBLIC OF POLAND

upon parliament. Th ese transformations, involving both structural and institutional changes, should
be aimed at establishing a network-based security structure, improving the eff ectiveness of adopted
measures, introducing more economical solutions as well as enhancing the qualitative development of
the system. In order to achieve these objectives, it is fi rst and foremost necessary for decision makers
to demonstrate the political will and abandon the sectoral thinking approach.

In the event of amending the Constitution, it would be advisable to consider an institution of
the changes proposed in this chapter with regard to national security.

It is impossible to state in an arbitrary fashion what should be the method and order of creating an internally consistent legal structure of the national security system. Th ere are a number of
autonomous regulations which may be developed, amended and improved without having a bearing
upon the remaining legal provisions governing the national security system. However, most pieces
of legislation remain functionally linked to one another – from the provisions relating to security in
the strict meaning of the word, through provisions which support the attainment of national security
objectives and the regulations pertaining to the “hard”, physical security of the state and right up to the
regulations which concern the broad area of “soft ”, local and individual security. A recommendable
course of action would be to start with the establishment of formal and legal conditions for the control
**of national security in the form of an act regulating this issue.**

In a consequence, a reference point for all the remaining special regulations pertaining to other
areas within the security system and its functions should be established. Th is will allow to eliminate
the most glaring drawbacks of the current system, making it possible to limit the duplication of tasks
and competences of the state authorities, better concretize the responsibilities of offi cers, simplify the
organizational structures within central institutions and systemize the strategic planning functions as
well as extend such planning processes to all entities composing the national security system.

At the executive decision-taking level, in order to improve the functionality and internal consistency of the entire system, it is advisable to establish a Council of Ministers Committee for Na**tional Security as well as to create an administrative structure of this Committee in the form of a Gov-**
ernment Centre for National Security, based on the existing Government Centre for Security.

Poland is in need of an integrated, modern and eff ective national security system; today the
system’s individual components do not always operate in an optimal manner. Th e improvement of
this system will require eff orts by practically all state institutions and authorities in the coming years.

### WHITE BOOKTON NATIONAL SECURITY OF THE REPUBLIC OF POLAND


-----

CONCLUSION

Th e comprehensive approach to national security as presented in this White Book is determined by the nature and pace of change in both the internal and external security environments of
the Republic of Poland in the coming years. Th e authors of this document realize that the presented
assessment of the future developments with respect to the security environment is characterized with
a relatively high degree of uncertainty, which is typical for any long-term forecasting. In order to mitigate this precariousness, we have presented several variants with respect to the development scenarios
in this environment. Th is has allowed us to design a number of options for strategic action and preparation of the State Bookin the fi eld of security in the coming years.

Th e present White Book is the fi rst attempt made in Poland to consider the questions of security in a comprehensive manner. Apart from the issues relating to “hard” security encompassing the
defence and protection of the state, particular emphasis is placed on new fi elds, sectors (both societal
and economic) and trans-sectoral security areas which have emerged in recent years and which present both challenges for and threats to the security of our state. Th e issues in question relate to fi nancial, energy, demographic, cybernetic, climatic and environmental security now and in future.

As shown by the analyses, Poland faces the need to tackle a variety of issues of diff erent scale.
Th e current international environment is generally favourable for Poland and its interests, hence the
opportunity for a rational and methodical development and conduct of our security policy. Th is White
Book lays substantive foundations for such endeavours. It is also possible to systematically enrich and
improve the adopted assumptions, plans and programmes and to verify the traditional approaches – as
well to plant new ones – in the course of subsequent periodical strategic reviews, as well as to reinforce
the Polish security potential and the standing of our country on the international scene. We should take
full advantage of these favourable opportunities in order to be adequately prepared for any “foul weather”
in the fi eld of security (which cannot and should not be ruled out on an a priori basis).

_Si vis pacem, para pacem_ (if you want peace, prepare for peace) – this paraphrased Roman
maxim should guide our eff orts aimed at increasing the level of security, the scope of which extends far
beyond the traditional military axiom. Th e present White Book is therefore addressed to state authorities and institutions, civic organizations as well as to the citizens themselves. It should form part of the
eff orts made within the education–for–security programme as well as form the basis for a debate on
this issue, which should be as broad as possible. Security ought not any longer to remain limited to the
obligations of the state – it is now also the commitment and responsibility of all citizens.

Th e publication of the fi rst ever Polish White Book on National Security elevates the process of
shaping the Polish strategic culture to a qualitatively new level. Th e authors hope that its publication
will increase the dynamics of the broad debate among citizens concerning Polish national security in
the 21[st] century. Th e success of this endeavour will be complete if, as a result, reforms are implemented
which to reinforce the synergies within the national security system through the integration of the
national security control system, the professionalization of operational subsystems (the defence subsystem and the protection subsystems) as well as the preparation of support subsystems (both societal
and economic) on a broadest possible scale.

Since we would also like the present White Book to contribute to the ongoing international
debate on security issues, especially with the participation of our NATO allies and EU partners, as
well as to a broader clarifi cation of the core values which underlie the tenets and contents of the Polish
security policy among other actors of international relations, the present document has hereby been
published in the English language.

Appendix 2

List of main conceptual categories

Basic category

**Security – the theory and practice of ensuring the possibility of survival (existence) and the realization of an entity’s**
own interests, including, in particular, by taking advantage of opportunities (favourable circumstances), facing challenges, reducing risks and counteracting (preventing and opposing) all kinds of threats to the given entity and its interests. Contemporary
security is integrated (comprehensive, multidimensional) in nature and may – depending on the adopted criteria – be subdivided into various types, fi elds, sectors, divisions and areas:

a) depending on the type of entity involved, the following types of security may be distinguished: individual (personal)
security, group security, national security (including state and territorial security: at the province, district and commune
level), international security (regional and global), including interstate security (alliances and coalition arrangements) and
transnational security;

b) depending on the subject (content) of security, it is possible to distinguish as many types, fi elds, sectors, divisions, areas etc.
as many potential spheres of activity of the given entity are possible (security issues arise in every sphere of activity):

i. Within the framework of integrated national security of the Republic of Poland (state security) it is possible to distinguish two constitutional areas thereof: internal and external security, as well as four primary fi elds of security: defence
(national defence, i.e. the military security of a state), protection (civilian, non-military security) as well as societal and
economic security (one may, in fact, also speak of “socio-economic security”, including societal and economic support
of security eff orts).

ii. Within the above fi elds, one may distinguish – in accordance with the Polish state activity structure, encompassing
a number of departments of public administration – national security sectors such as: diplomacy for security, military
issues, intelligence and counterintelligence, public security, emergency rescue, societal security (including, inter alia,
the protection of heritage, education for security, the media in the security system), economic security (including, inter
_alia, energy, fi nancial and infrastructural security);_

iii. Due to the very nature of integrated security there are also security areas which span multiple sectors or fi elds, such as
cyber-security.

Defi nition subcategories:

**Security entity – every consciously existing and intentionally operating entity (whether individual or collective) con-**
sidered from the point of view of the security thereof. With respect to security analyzed from a political perspective, the main
types of security entities are states (nations organized in the form of states), organizational entities of states (e.g. states, federated
states, provinces, local government units) as well as international organizations (interstate organizations as well as the increasingly important non-state structures such as multinational corporations or terrorist and criminal organizations).

**Interests of a security entity – the aggregated expectations of an entity towards its environment, derived from and**
shaped by its identity, values, historical heritage, traditions, current needs and future aspirations and goals. One may distinguish
between critical interests (pertaining to the continuing existence of the given entity) and desired interests (related to the quality
of such existence).

**Security environment – the internal and external, military and non-military (civilian) security conditions (the condi-**
tions for the realization of the interests of the given entity in the fi eld of security and the attainment of the goals designated by
such entity in this regard), characterized by using four basic categories, i.e.: opportunities, challenges, risks and threats.


-----

APPENDICES

**Security opportunities – circumstances which arise independently of the will of the given entity (phenomena and**
processes occurring within the security environment) which are favourable to the realization of interests and the attainment of
objectives of the entity in question in the fi eld of security.

**Security challenges –** problematic situations giving rise to decision-making dilemmas faced by the given entity when
adopting its course of action with regard to security issues. If security challenges are not properly addressed or responded to,
they may, in eff ect, transform into actual security threats.

**Security risks – risks of occurrence of consequences of the actions of the given entity within the sphere of security**
which are unfavourable to the entity in question.

**Security threats – direct or indirect destructive infl uences aff ecting the given entity. It is the most classic factor which**
appears within the security environment; threats can be divided into potential and real threats, subjective and objective threats,
external and internal threats, military and non-military threats, threats related to crises and armed confl icts as well as intentional and accidental (fortuitous) threats.

**Integrated security – a type of security which is established where links and interactions (both natural and inten-**
tionally established) exist between various security entities, types, fi elds, sectors, divisions, areas etc., resulting in a security
becoming integrated into a single, internally consistent whole and ensuring the greater effi ciency thereof through the resulting
synergy eff ect.

**National security (state security) – a type of security the subject (security entity) of which is the nation, organized in**
the form of a state.

**Areas of national security (state security) – the spheres of activity of the state in the fi eld of security, distinguished**
from the point of view of the implementation of four main groups of security tasks, i.e. defence (military security, national
defence), protection (civilian, non-military safety; protection of the population, infrastructural resources and state structures)
as well as societal and economic security, including the societal and economic support of security eff orts). In organizational
practice, fi elds of national security are in fact aggregated security sectors.

**National security (state security) sectors – components of integrated national security, corresponding (subject to cer-**
tain corrections where necessary) to the government administration departments operating under relevant statutory provisions
or groups of such departments, aggregated due to the similarity of subject matter (proximity in terms of the scope of activities
of entities responsible for individual departments).

**Trans-sectoral (involving many entities) areas of national security (state security) – components of integrated na-**
tional security, encompassing the issues typical of various security entities, fi elds and sectors (e.g. external or internal security
or issues related to contemporary multinational, asymmetrical security processes and phenomena, such as, for example, information security (including cybernetic security), prevention of terrorism, non-proliferation of weapons of mass destruction,
combating of organized crime). Such areas are frequently identifi ed due to practical needs which are of an urgent nature at
the given time and which raise qualitatively novel issues with respect to which there is no obvious recipient within the existing
executive structure of the given entity.

**External state security – a trans-sectoral area of security the contents of which (objectives, conditions, means and**
methods) pertain to the external environment of the state (i.e. its surroundings).

**Internal state security – a trans-sectoral area of security the contents of which (objectives, conditions, means and**
methods) pertain to the internal environment of the state.

**Information security (including cybernetic security) of the state – a trans-sectoral area of security the contents of**
which (objectives, conditions, means and methods) pertain to the information environment of the state (including cyberspace).

Miscellaneous conceptual categories:

APPENDICES
**Strategic objectives of the state in the fi eld of security – operationalized national interests, i.e. the future conditions,**
phenomena and processes in the fi eld of security (resulting from the disaggregation of individual national interests, made in the
context of specifi c (both current and predicted) strategic security conditions as well as the needs and possibilities (the strategic
potential of the state)) which are considered desirable from the point of view of the said national interests. Unlike national
interests themselves, which are a relatively permanent category, strategic objectives pertain to specifi c conditions in the given
historical period of existence of the given entity; the objectives in question are attained through the implementation of a security
policy.

**Strategic activities of the state in the fi eld of security – military and non-military activities of the state and the basic**
components thereof, aimed at ensuring the possibility of realization of national interests and the attainment of strategic objectives in a dangerous environment.

**National security control – the activities of the public authorities and administrative bodies, encompassing the deter-**
mination of national interests and strategic objectives in the fi eld of security, the preparation of plans of strategic actions leading
to the attainment of such objectives, the programming and organization activities aimed at ensuring the adequate preparation
of the state in the fi eld of security as well as the coordination and supervision of the implementation of plans and programmes
according to the needs which stem from the conditions prevailing within the security environment (opportunities, challenges,
risks and threats).

**Strategic preparations in the fi eld of security –** the activities of all state structures aimed at attaining and maintaining
their capabilities which are necessary for the purposes of executing of tasks provided for under strategic action plans. In particular, such preparations encompass planning, budgetary, investment, training and similar activities.

**Strategic self-identifi cation – the diagnosis of one’s own state as a security entity (the ascertainment of the existing**
