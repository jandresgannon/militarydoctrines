###### Security Environment


1.1 India’s foreign policy and defence strategy seeks to

ensure a peaceful and enabling environment for achieving

transformative national growth and development. A

complex and increasingly unpredictable interplay of

regional and global developments, ranging from West Asia

to the Indo Pacific, shapes India’s security environment.

Guided by the principles of strategic autonomy and self

the year, India continued to adopt a holistic approach to

security threats and successfully addressed its security

imperatives, including emerging aspects such as energy

security, information and cyber security and environmental

issues.

1.4 The situation in India’s immediate neighbourhood
remains complex. There has been a rise in terrorism in the
Pakistan-Afghanistan region. In Sri Lanka and Nepal, the
success of post-conflict transition processes depend on the
ability of the political system to evolve an inclusive agenda
that accommodates the aspirations of all communities. The
growing trend of countries in the region falling into debttraps through new paradigms of external developmental
assistance poses a challenge to the long term stability of
these relatively small and vulnerable economies. Such loans
and assistance have already led to adverse consequences
for some recipient countries.

1.5 In Afghanistan, the emergence of ‘Islamic State’
and Taliban with the support of countries in the region and
outside has further complicated the security situation and
continued to foment terrorism and violence. The Afghan
National Security Forces, with the help of US and NATO
forces, continue to target Taliban and Islamic State to
reduce their influence. The Taliban however continues
to pursue distinct military as well as political objectives
in Afghanistan. The newly announced US policy for

1.11 The politico-security situation in Pakistan
continues to remain problematic. Law enforcement and
security agencies remained largely unaccountable for
human rights violations and exercised disproportionate
political influence. Pakistan’s precarious economic situation
and fluid political setting since the ouster of former Prime
Minister Nawaz Sharif in July 2017 pose serious challenges
to its internal stability. The Pakistan Army maintains its rigid
control on national security policies. Pakistan continues to
pursue a confrontational policy vis-a-vis India, primarily
driven by Pakistan Army and ISI. The proxy war through
its Jehadi organizations in Jammu and Kashmir continues
unabated. Under the rubric of CPEC, China has positioned
itself as the primary supplier of military hardware, technoeconomic funding and diplomatic support to Pakistan. The
Pakistan Army continues to differentiate between good
and bad terrorists and nurture anti-India terror groups as
strategic assets. Internationally proscribed terror entities
and individuals are being encouraged to enter the political
mainstream in Pakistan.

1.12 Sri Lanka is a key strategic partner with an
important role in ensuring security and stability in the
Indian Ocean Region. Increasing investments from foreign
entities with a high debt component is a concern. India
continued to engage with Sri Lanka on issues of defence
and security, including capacity building and training of
the armed forces.

1.13 Though events in 2017 added to the complexities
in India-China relations, the strategic dialogue between
India and China continued under the overall context of a
developmental partnership, which also helped in peaceful
disengagement of border personnel of India and China
at the face-off site in the Doklam region. Both sides
recognized that ensuring peace and tranquillity in the

the Indo-US defence partnership has progressed in tandem

freedom of navigation in the Indian Ocean and the wider

the key objectives of India’s engagement with the US and

While constantly reviewing its operational preparedness/

postures to meet the perceived security challenges, the

Indian Army (IA) is committed to the defence of the

country from external and internal threats across the entire

spectrum of warfare. Also, in times of disaster/ natural

calamities, the Indian Army is in the forefront, providing


soft targets like security force bases and convoys. The

sentiments of the local population are being exploited by

Separatists and inimical elements to ignite passion and to

destabilise democratic institutions. Increased radicalisation

3.10 **_Assam:_** The security situation in the State
remained largely peaceful and under control. Calibrated,
synergised and coordinated operations by Security
Forces significantly reduced the operational space of
insurgent groups. National Democratic Front of Bodoland
(Saraigaora) {NDFB (S)} has been marginalised leading to
demoralisation and disenchantment amongst its cadres.
Insurgent groups are facing acute financial crunch and
have resorted to extortion and sporadic acts of violence to
maintain their relevance.

3.11 **_Nagaland:_** Security situation in the State has
improved considerably since 2015. National Socialist
Council of Nagaland (Khaplang) [NSCN(K)] has been
marginalized due to focused counter insurgency operations
by Security Forces and presently its activities are confined
to Eastern Nagaland and Myanmar Naga Hills. Concerted
and relentless operations by Security Forces along India –
Myanmar border (IMB) has severely dented the outfit, both
physically and psychologically.

3.12 Framework Agreement for Naga Peace Accord
was signed on August 3, 2015 and attempts to gain
consensus of various stakeholders by Government of
India is in progress. National Socialist Council of Nagaland
(KitoviNeakpao) and six Insurgent Groups have come
together to form the ‘Working Group’ in an attempt to
counter the increased influence of National Socialist
Council of Nagaland (Isaac Muivah) {NSCN (IM)}. The
Working Group of Naga National People’s Group (NNPG)
have recently met Mr RN Ravi to convey their concerns on

and its opposition were the main factors for protests in
Manipur. Politics of “Blockades” and “Bandhs” continued
to prevail and led to increasing fissures amongst the three
major communities namely; Meiteis – Nagas – Kukis. The
State is witnessing increased activities of NSCN (IM) in
Naga dominated areas. There is also increased activity
of Civil Society Organisations seeking clarification on the
content of the Frame Work Agreement and these have
been voicing concerns over maintaining territorial integrity
of Manipur in light of the NSCN (IM)’s claim for Nagalim.

3.15 **_Arunachal Pradesh:_** Security situation in
Arunachal Pradesh has been gradually improving in terms
of reduction in violent incidents, lower civilian casualties
and increasing number of apprehending of terrorists.
Synergised operations by Security Forces have reduced the
operational space of insurgents. Apart from the districts
of Longding, Tirap and Changlang, the areas falling under
the jurisdiction of 11 Police stations along the Assam
border have been declared as ‘Disturbed Area’ for six
months beyond September 30, 2017. Earlier areas under 14
police stations were declared as ‘Disturbed Area’.


3.18 **_Mizoram: State remained peaceful with increase_**
in attempts by insurgent groups to smuggle arms and
narcotics. Off late there is an increase in activities of
Myanmar Ethnic Armed Groups (EAG) along the trijunction of India, Myanmar and Bangladesh Border. There is
a likelihood of spill-over of EAG activities in South Mizoram
and influx of Myanmar population fearing violence by
EAGs. Crackdown of Myanmar Army on ArakanRohingya
Salvation Army (ARSA) has led to mass exodus of certain
communities from Myanmar to neighbouring countries.
Proactive measures are thus being taken to establish a
coordinated intelligence grid and undertake effective
border management to preclude any deterioration of
situation on own side of India Myanmar Border.

3.19 **_Tripura:_** The State has remained comparatively
peaceful and violence was within the threshold of law and
order. Based on requisition from District Magistrate, West
Tripura and Khowai districts, Assam Rifles columns were
deployed in aid to civil authority for maintaining law and
order in the affected areas with effect from September 21
to 30, 2017.

3.20 **_Summary: The year 2017 witnessed reduced_**
levels of violence which reflect the efforts of Security
Forcesto ensure transition of security environment from

3.24 Disengagement at Face-Off Point between
own troops and PLA took place on August 28, 2017. The
mutual disengagement was a result of intense diplomatic
communications between both the sides, complemented
by the firm Resolve and Determination shown by Indian
Army on ground. Post the disengagement, however, deescalation of troops is yet to take place.

3.26 **_Transgressions:_** The number of transgressions
in 2017 have increased from 2016 indicating PLA’s

the Northern Borders are 334 (including 65 by fishermen
at Dichu) vis-a-vis 235 (including 56 by fishermen at Dichu)
in 2016 for the corresponding period.

###### DEFENCE COOPERATION WITH FRIENDLY FOREIGN COUNTRIES

3.27 Defence Cooperation activities constitute an
important tool for furtherance of our national interests
and foreign policy objectives. In keeping with India’s rising
global stature in recent years, there has been a considerable
increase in Defence Cooperation activities undertaken
by the Indian Army. Accordingly, an increasing number
of Friendly Foreign Countries (FFCs) have shown keen
interest to engage with the Indian Army, which is viewed
not only as the world’s second largest standing Army
but also as a professional, apolitical force with extensive
combat experience and exemplary training standards. As
on date, Indian Army undertakes Defence cooperation
activities with 99 countries.

###### RASHTRIYA RIFLES

3.56 Rashtriya Rifles since its raising has
rendered invaluable assistance towards the security as
well as socio-economic development of the State. During
2017, Rashtriya Rifles has relentlessly pressed on with its
operational tasks. The Force as a whole provided pivotal
support for maintaining peace and tranquillity in the State
which otherwise continues to be in turmoil.


This has made a visible change in the way people

perceive the Army, besides increasing the comfort levels

between 'Awaam' and 'Jawan'. Also, Youth Employment

and Guidance Nodes (YEGN), set up by Rashtriya Rifles,

targeted the youth of the State effectively. This has

helped them explore avenues of higher education and

employment, thus guiding them away from the lure of

easy money and a misplaced sense of power through

terrorism.

3.61 Creation of Rashtriya Rifles, the only specially

structured Counter Insurgency/Counter Terrorism Force in

the world has been one of the finest examples of a strategic

decision with a long term perspective. The expertise

gained is invaluable in building comprehensive National

###### Defence Production


7.1 The Department of Defence Production (DDP)
was set up in November 1962 with the objective of
developing a comprehensive production infrastructure to
produce the weapons/ systems/ platforms/ equipment
required for defence. Over the years, the Department has
established wide ranging production facilities for various
defence equipment through the Ordnance Factories
and Defence Public Sector Undertakings (DPSUs). The
products being manufactured by these units include arms
and ammunition, tanks, armoured vehicles, heavy vehicles,
fighter aircraft and helicopters, warships, submarines,
missiles, ammunition, electronic equipment, earth moving
equipment, special alloys and special purpose steels. The
Department has also made efforts to increase private
sector participation in defence manufacturing through its
policies and programmes.

pursued by the Department, been outsourcing many of
their requirements and have over the years developed
a wide vendor base which includes a large number of
medium and small scale enterprises apart from large

###### Private Sector Participation

7.7 To achieve the goal of self-reliance in the Defence
sector, continuous efforts are being made to increase
indigenization, wherever technologically feasible and
economically viable.

7.8 In May, 2001, the Defence Industry sector, which
was hitherto reserved for the public sector, was opened
up to 100% for Indian private sector participation, with
Foreign Direct Investment (FDI) up to 26% both subject
to licensing. However, Department of Industrial Policy &
Promotion, Ministry of Commerce & Industry vide Press
Note No. 5 (2016 Series) (Available at www.dipp.nic.
in under Acts and Rules followed by Press Notes), has
allowed FDI under automatic route up to 49% and above
49% wherever it is likely to result in access to modern
technology or for other reasons to be recorded. Further,
defence industry is subjected to industrial license under
Industries (Development & Regulation) Act, 1951 and
manufacturing of small arms and ammunition under the
Arms Act, 1959 and Arms Rules, 2016. Other conditions can
be viewed on DIPP website (www.dipp.nic.in) under FDI
policy followed by Consolidated FDI Policy Circular of 2017.


7.11 Further, subsequent to abolition of the Foreign
Investment Promotion Board (FIPB), the work of granting
government approval for foreign investment under the
extant FDI Policy has been entrusted to the concerned
Administrative Ministries/ Departments. DIPP has been
given the responsibility of overseeing the applications
filed on the Foreign Investment Facilitation Portal and to
forward the same to the concerned Administrative Ministry.
The proposals on FDI in Defence sector is scrutinised in
DDP.

7.12 DIPP has, so far issued 343 Industrial Licences
(ILs) covering 206 companies till November, 2017
for manufacture of a wide range of defence items to
private companies. 69 licensed companies covering 112
industrial licenses have so far reported commencement of
production.

7.13 After opening up of the Defence Industry Sector
for Indian Private Sector Participation, so far 40 FDI
proposals/ Joint Ventures have been approved in defence
sector for manufacture of various defence equipment,
both in public and private sector. FDI amounting to ` 25.51
crores (US$ 5.12 million) has been received in the Defence
Industry Sector from April, 2000 to September, 2017

Organisation (DRDO) has come a long way since its

inception on January 1, 1958 to become a major Science

& Technology force to reckon with in the country. Starting

as a very small organisation with only 10 laboratories,

DRDO has grown multi-dimensionally and emerged as a


technological advice to the MoD in support of defence

policy; as evaluator of defence equipment for the

military operational requirements; and generating new

technological knowledge to be transferred to the defence

industries for development of state-of-the-art weapon

systems.

Indian Army is one of the biggest recruiters in the
country which recruits almost 60,000 youths into the
Army each year. Previously, recruitment was carried out
through an ‘Open Rally System’ wherein candidates
could walk in for recruitment without applying for
a rally. The ‘Revised Recruitment System’ has been
introduced wherein a candidate is required to register
online with the overall aim of reducing masses which
turn up for recruitment by a regulated call up system.
Thus connected administrative and discipline issues
that arise due to large crowd have been negated. Till
date, 225 rallies have conducted with the ‘Revised
Recruitment System’ and approximately 55 lakh
aspirants have applied online through the directorate of
Recruiting website: www.joinindianarmy.nic.in. The revised
Recruitment Rally System is being implemented in the
following phases:

forward, a revised ‘Make’ procedure was promulgated

which provides for Government funding upto 90 percent

and preferential treatment to MSMEs.

18.15 The ‘Make’ procedure under the Defence

Procurement Procedures which was introduced initially

in 2006, provides for collaboration between Government

and private Indian Industry for indigenous design,

Two sub-categories of ‘Make’ viz. ‘Make-I’ and ‘Make-II’

were introduced in 2016. Make-II procedure is for projects

of prototype development without Government funding.

As a major boost to ‘Make in India’ in the defence sector,

the Defence Acquisition Council (DAC) on 16[th] January

2018 cleared a simplified ‘Make-II’ procedure after a series

of consultations with the industry. Salient features of the

The defence pension is disbursed to over 25 lakh pensioners
involving an expenditure of over ` 60,000 crore every year.
The defence pension management system rests primarily
on four pillars comprising the Record Offices that maintain
the service records, the pension sanctioning authorities, the
pension disbursing agencies and the RBI, which manages
the cash balance of the government and reimburses the
pension disbursed by the banks to the pensioners.

Pension is sanctioned by the Principal Controllers of
Defence Accounts, at Allahabad, Mumbai (for Navy)
and Controller of Defence Account, New Delhi (for Air
Force), working under the Controller General of Defence
Accounts, Ministry of Defence. Pension is disbursed by
the Defence Pension Disbursing Offices (DPDO) of the
Defence Accounts Department, banks, Indian Embassy,
Nepal, State Treasuries, Pay & Accounts Offices and Post
Office, Kathua (J&K).

**Why did we do this Review?**

The review was undertaken to ascertain the efficiency
and effectiveness of the Pension Disbursement System
including the budgeting, accounting and internal controls
existing in the four pillars of the defence pension system
viz., the Record Offices, the Pension Sanctioning Authorities
(PSAs), the Pension Disbursement Agencies (PDAs) and
the Reserve Bank of India. The objective of the review
was to report on the efficiency and effectiveness issues,
including the Information Technology applications in place,
with a view to make appropriate recommendations.

amount lying in the suspense head at the end of March,

2016 was ` 6,831.95 crore.

**2.** **Inefficiencies in the pension authorisation**
**process**

We observed that the process for authorization of the
pension involved several players and multiple stages,
often resulting in avoidable delays in issue of the pension
payment order (PPOs). There was a need for review of the
authorization process, so that it is less cumbersome and
less time consuming.

We also observed that although the information is
being captured electronically at the Record Offices, the
PSAs and the PDAs, the lack of their integration results
in an inefficient flow of information that is prone to
transcription errors and the resultant error in the pension
payments.

(b) Similarly, we observed overpayment of ` 118.23
crore to 11,973 pensioners based on test audit
of the records of one month. Major reasons for
over-payment were incorrect revision of pension,
non-deduction of commuted portion of pension,
and irregular payment of fixed medical allowance.
Analysis of bulk data for the period 2011-12 to
2015-16 indicated an overpayment of ` 518.70
crore. These cases needed detailed investigation.

**(Paragraph 4.3)**

(c) Out test audit also indicated several cases of
double payments and other irregularities in
disbursement of pension such as pensions
of multiple pensioners being credited to one
account, pension being paid by the PDA without
the Pension Payment orders (PPOs), and certain
instances of pension being paid from the defence
head to the pensioners of other departments.

**(Paragraph 4.4 and 4.5)**


**(Paragraph 4.9)**

**4.** **Control deficiencies**

We observed control deficiencies in all the four pillars

of the pension disbursement system which adversely

impacted the efficiency and effectiveness of the system.

Some of the major control deficiencies were:

-----

- While the existing monitoring system for
timely authorisation of the pension should be
strengthened, the existing procedure should be
reviewed to see if it could be simplified to make
the process less cumbersome and less time
consuming. Lessons learnt on the non-defence,
civil pension side, including delegated powers to
Heads of the Offices to sanction pension, could be
explored for adoption.

- PPOs should be sent by the PSAs
directly to the PDAs, in electronic form.

- The three pillars-Record Offices, PSAs, and PDAsshould be connected online, enabling automated
flow of information, in a secure mode, with proper
validation and security checks.

- PCDA (P) should implement comprehensive
e-audit of the scrolls for timely detection of
deviations, including under and overpayments, to
enable prompt corrective action.


This Report relates to matters arising from the audit of the
financial transactions of IAF and relevant records relating
to IAF in the Ministry of Defence (MoD), Defence Accounts

**Sector**

In view of the threat perception, Government of India
approved the induction of Strategic missile in the ‘S’
sector to provide the necessary deterrence. The missile
systems were to be installed at the six designated sites,
between 2013 and 2015. But till date none of the missile
systems has been installed. The main reason for the
delay in installation of the missile systems procured at `
3,619.25 crore from M/s Bharat Electronics Limited (BEL)
was, delay in execution of civil works at the sites.

be undertaken from Air Force Station ‘CC’.


Serviceability of the IL fleet of the Indian Air Force (IAF)
was low because of delay in servicing and repair. This was
in turn largely attributable to poor availability of spares and

inadequate infrastructure and support facilities the Air to

This report contains major findings arising from the test
audit of transactions of the Indian Navy and the Indian
Coast Guard. Some of the major findings included in the
Report are discussed below:

**I** **Performance Audit on the Inventory Management**
**of Naval Stores, Equipment and Spare Parts in**
**Indian Navy**

Material planning has many areas of responsibility, but
the most significant ones are provisioning, inventory
management and issue management. Good inventory
management is vital to reduce inventory carrying
cost. Information technology has a vital role to play in
provisioning and continuous improvement in this area
through automation in the form of Integrated Logistics
Management System, an on-line, data linked computer
system supporting the Navy’s material planning.

The procurement quantity generated by the system based
provisioning formula was on the higher side and was
projecting quantities equivalent to three to six years’ annual
consumption requirements due to an algebraic anomaly
in the existing formula. Inventory control mechanism in
the Indian Navy is deficient to the extent that it was not
following the ABC categorisation norms. This impacts the
quality of review provisioning and assessment of maximum
and minimum stock levels of inventory. Laid down timeline
for processing of indents was not adhered to leading to
cascading effect in procurement of stores. Items procured
under Proprietary Article Certificate and Single Tender
Enquiry were significantly more vis-a-vis items procured
under Open Tender Enquiry and Rate Contracts, which
led to reduced competition/ monopolistic situation.

is therefore, imperative that Navy maintains its assets free

were involved in 38 accidents, primarily attributable to

fire/explosion/flooding. The Indian Navy since inception

Despite serious concerns highlighted by Audit in
Performance Audit report on Ammunition management in
Army, no significant improvement took place in the critical
deficiency in availability of ammunition and quality of
ammunition supplied by the Ordnance Factory Board (OFB)
since March 2013. Shortfall in meeting the production target
by OFB continued. Further, majority of the procurement
cases from other than OFB which were initiated by Army HQ
during 2009-13 were pending as of January 2017. There were
persisting delays in completion of the defect investigation
by DGQA and replacement/repair of rejected/unserviceable
ammunition by OFB. Ammunition depots with shortage
of fire fighting staff and equipment remained accident
prone.

**(Paragraph 3.2)**

**Loss due to non-recovery of rent and premium in respect**
**of Mobile Towers installed in a military station**

13 mobile towers of private telephone companies were
installed at Chandimandir Military Station without the
requisite approval of the Ministry of Defence, leading to
loss of ` 4.33 crore on account of non-recovery of rent and
premium.

**Wasteful expenditure on procurement of incompatible**

In procurement of 20 numbers of Photowrite Systems,
Director General Military Intelligence had accepted

systems became non functional within 3 to 22 months of
procurement resulting in loss of ` 21.28 crore. Despite
poor performance of the firm during delivery and warranty

###### ORDNANCE FACTORY ORGANISATION

**Performance of Ordnance Factory Board**


Failure of Chief Engineer, Bareilly to make clear provision

of bypass road in drawings and to incorporate the

complete scope of work in the contract had resulted in

non-completion of the road. As a result, Explosive Dump

constructed in May, 2014 at a cost of ` 7.65 crore could not

be utilized.

**(Paragraph 4.6)**

**Avoidable extra expenditure**

Failure of Director General, Border roads in accepting

offset by surplus generated by the IFD factories (` 227

**(Paragraph 7.1)**

**Management of Import Contract in Ordnance Factories**

Ordnance Factories import crucial part of its stores and

plants & machineries. Audit examination of selected

import contracts concluded by the five factories during

2012-15 revealed that there were deficiencies in

management of the contracts at pre-contract as well as

post-contract stages.


**Non-revision of Labour Estimates after introduction of CNC**
**machines and incorrect payment of Piece Work Profit**

Ordnance Factories are required to revise the Labour
Estimates after introduction of Computer Numerically
Controlled (CNC) machines. The Estimates quantifies the
unit labour cost for each item of production and serves
as the template for labour planning, deployment and
control on costs. But in three-fourth of the sampled cases
examined, the selected four Factories did not revise the
labour estimates.

In deviation from the norms laid down by the Board, two
Factories over-estimated the labour hours (SMH) required
for meeting production targets in 2013-14 and 2014-15.
All the four Factories under-estimated the available SMH
in eight out of 10 instances by applying incorrect norms
during 2012-15. The Target SMH and Available SMH figures
being unreliable, labour planning in the Factories was
deficient to that extent. At Metal & Steel Factory (MSF)
Ishapore, actual output SMH was less that those reported
in three production shops in 99 out of 102 instances. This
resulted in excess payment of Piece Work Profit (PWP)
aggregating ` 2.60 crore to direct Industrial Employees
(IEs). Further, payments of PWP to indirect workers (not
eligible for PWP) were also noticed in all the four Factories.

While 403 (80 per cent) of the remaining warrants were

closed after the stipulated period, 101 warrants (15 per

cent) were still open and awaiting closure (March 2015).

Open warrants provided an opportunity to the Factories

to spread rejections across warrants (in order to keep

it within the normal rejection limits) or transfer excess

material or excess labour drawn to other warrant through

Transfer Vouchers. Transfer Vouchers were being used

in the Factories without following the relevant internal

controls.

**Procurement of defective Radiators**

Heavy Vehicles Factory (HVF), Avadi placed an order for

Radiators to be fitted in T-90 tanks on a firm which had

no prior experience of manufacturing required Radiators.

**Under utilisation of costly machines**

Two tooled-up CNC machines were purchased at a total
cost of ` 9.32 crore by Rifle Factory Ishapore despite
the existing capacity to meet the targets. One tooled-up
machine is non- functional since July 2014 for want of
special purpose tools (as of April 2016) and the prospect
of utilization of the other machine engaged in production
of two components is also bleak in view of procurement of
these components from trade at a much cheaper rate.

As per Indent, T-72 Bridge Laying Tanks (BLT) variants
