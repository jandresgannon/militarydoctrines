## DEFENSE OF JAPAN

**On the Publication of Defense of Japan 2022**

KISHI Nobuo
Minister of Defense

The international community is currently facing its greatest trial since WWII. It is not an exaggeration

to say that we have entered a new period of crisis in the twenty-first century. Russia’s aggression

against Ukraine has shocked the world, with the loss of countless innocent civilians’ lives giving

rise to deep indignation and grief. Such unilateral changes to the status quo by force should never be

tolerated, as they shake the very foundation of the international order based on universal values that

has supported the peace and prosperity of the international community.

This defiance of international order is not just Europe’s problem. As strategic competition between

nations becomes more apparent against the backdrop of changes to the global power balance, the

existing order is being exposed to serious challenges, especially in the Indo-Pacific region, which is

at the center of this competition.

In particular, China continues to unilaterally change or attempt to change the status quo by

coercion in the East China Sea and South China Sea. The country’s ties with Russia, an aggressor

nation, have deepened in recent years, with joint navigations and flights being conducted in the areas

surrounding Japan by both Chinese and Russian vessels and aircraft. Furthermore, China has made

clear that it would not hesitate to unify Taiwan by force, further increasing tensions in the region.

North Korea has repeatedly carried out ballistic missile launches well into 2022, thereby

unilaterally escalating its provocations towards the international community. It has also defended

Russia in respect of the latter’s aggression against Ukraine, asserting that the fault for this situation

lies with the United States and other Western countries.


-----

Fortunately, Japan has many likeminded partners. In the face of unprecedented challenges,

the ties between the partners are further strengthened. Among these, the bond of the Japan–U.S.

Alliance remains unshakeable, and trilateral cooperation among Japan, the U.S., and Australia, and

quadrilateral cooperation among Japan, the U.S., Australia, and India, are further deepening. Also,

as symbolized by vessels making port calls to Japan one after another last year, Japan continues to

work together with European nations to ensure that the region is free and open.

As a way of defending against any such changes to the international order based on universal

values, Japan must not delay in bringing together its knowledge and technology and putting all its

collective efforts into strengthening its national defense capabilities.

Japan is currently working on drawing up a new National Security Strategy, etc. under the order

of Prime Minister Kishida, and the Government will establish these new strategies boldly and

creatively, thinking flexibly beyond existing paradigms in order to preemptively deter changes to the

status quo by force and to also be fully prepared for modern warfare, including information warfare

and cyber warfare, both seen during Russia’s aggression against Ukraine.

Right now, a large gray cloud hangs over the path towards world peace and security, and the

outlook is seemingly obscure. However, one thing for certain is that creating the international order

of tomorrow rests on the choices and actions of the people of today. Standing firm in its policies

as a peace-loving nation, Japan resolutely continues to oppose any parties who attempt to forcibly

change the world order. Japan also intends to continue demonstrating the strength of freedom and

democracy and the significance of human rights and laws to the world through its unwavering

conviction and tireless efforts.

To constantly defend Japan in a resolute manner and ensure continued regional and international

peace and prosperity, as well as international order based on universal values, which has come to

support this peace and prosperity thus far, the Ministry of Defense (MOD) and the Self-Defense

Forces (SDF) will continue to decisively deal with any and all difficulties to push through this time

of trial.

We hope that this white paper clearly explains to Japanese and international readers that the MOD

and the SDF have the will and capability to achieve the above, in addition to helping further increase

understanding of the environment surrounding Japan and the efforts of the MOD and the SDF.

the fusion of military and civilian resources), and
intelligentization (use of AI, etc.), with the aim of
building a “world-class military.”*

it has been pointed out that China may be trying to develop military
forces that are equal to—or in some cases superior to—the U.S. force.

concerns that the effects of such unilateral changes to the status quo by force
may extend to the Indo-Pacific region.

In addition to the use of military forces, Russia is believed to have used so-called “hybrid warfare” methods in its aggression against Ukraine,
including cyber attacks on internet networks and disinformation campaigns. As for Ukraine, it is reported that political leaders are disseminating
information and UAV operations are being conducted using satellite internet provided by U.S. companies.

**◆** Deterrence:
The ability to discourage another country from aggression.

Deterrence is essential in preventing eterrence is essential in preventing

changes to the status quo backed by force.

Strong Japan-

-  It is essential for inter-state and regional stability to have the necessary defense capabilities to U.S. Alliance
discourage aggression and make other states understand that they cannot invade one’s country.

-  A strong alliance can bilaterally prevent aggression from other countries.

-  Providing one country’s deterrence capabilities to its allies and others is called “extended
deterrence.” For example, the U.S. provides Japan with extended deterrence through its various
capabilities.

-  A system of collective opposition (economic sanctions, military sanctions, etc.) to aggressor nations
based on treaties, etc., can also serve as deterrence, and NATO is an example of this.

**Examples of Japan’s deterrence efforts** Bilateral training with

U.S. Air Force bombers

Aerial maneuvers training conducted by V-22 Osprey

In order to fully exert Japan’s defense capabilities, JSDF must
continuously maintain and improve its tactical skills and
response capabilities from peacetime, and training and
exercise comprise one of the important elements in this regard.
This will help to clearly demonstrate Japan’s strong defense
posture and firm intentions to defend itself, and will serve as
deterrence to discourage other countries from aggression.

**Intensifying Inter-state Competition and Challenges to the Existing Order**

As the balance of power changes, inter-state competition is becoming prominent across political, economic,

military, and other realms. Foremost among these is the intensifying strategic competition between the U.S. and

China, as well as the global issue of responding to challenges to the existing order, such as Russia’s aggression

against Ukraine. Such inter-state competition is constantly occurring through a variety of means, including social

networks (SNS), and sometimes even through “hybrid warfare” that combines military and non-military measures.

In addition, technological advances are fundamentally changing the nature of security. Countries are focusing

on developing and utilizing so-called game-changing technologies—cutting-edge technologies such as artificial

intelligence (AI) and hypersonic technology—while at the same time recognizing the importance of economic

security, such as preventing the outflow of such technologies. Science, technology, and innovation are at the core

of intensifying inter-state competition. U.S.-China virtual summit in September 2021 [AFP/Jiji]

**Various Security Challenges Facing**
**the Indo-Pacific Region**

The Indo-Pacific region in which Japan is situated has been significantly affected by changes to the global

balance of power and faces various security challenges. In particular, the tension between the U.S. and China is

becoming more pronounced in Taiwan and the South China Sea.

In addition, in the Korean Peninsula, people have remained divided for more than half a century. In recent

years, so called gray-zone situations have tended to persist for extended periods of time as a part of wars

between nations, and have the risk of rapidly developing into more serious situations without any obvious signs.

**Unilateral Changes to the Status Quo by Force Shake**
**the Foundation of the International Order, including Asia**

Russia’s aggression against Ukraine that began in February 2022 infringes upon the sovereignty and territorial

integrity of Ukraine. It is a serious violation of international law prohibiting the use of force and of the UN Charter.

Such unilateral changes to the status quo by force have shaken the very foundation of the whole international
order, not only in Europe, but in Asia as well.

This is an unprecedented situation in which a permanent member of the UN Security Council, whose primary

responsibility is maintaining international peace and security, is engaging in military actions that conflict with
international law and order and is claiming the lives of innocent people. The international community, including

Japan, must not tolerate this, since tolerating Russia’s aggression may imply that unilateral changes to the status

quo by force are acceptable in Asia and other regions.

As a result of the current aggression, it is possible that Russia’s national power in the medium- to long- [SPUTNIK/Jiji Press Photo]

The Biden administration has focused on reestablishing U.S. dominance and prevailing

in strategic competition with China. In the National Defense Strategy Fact Sheet released

in March 2022, the administration identified China as its most consequential strategic

competitor and pacing challenge, to be addressed with the highest priority, followed by the

Russia challenge.

The administration also outlined policies for reinforcing cooperation with allies and

partners. In September 2021, the first face-to-face Leaders’ Summit of the “Quad,”

consisting of Japan, the U.S., Australia, and India, was held, and AUKUS, a new security

cooperation framework between Australia, the U.K., and the U.S. was established. In

February 2022, the Biden administration also released its first regional strategy: the Indo-

Pacific Strategy of the United States.

**China Aims to Become a “World-Class Military” by Accelerating “Intelligentization”**
**through Civil-Military Fusion (CMF), etc.**

China is aiming to build a “world-class military” by the mid-21st century. For over 30 years,

it has been growing its defense budget at high levels, engaging in rapid improvement of

its military power in qualitative and quantitative terms with focus on nuclear, missile, naval

and air forces. In summer 2021, China reportedly conducted a test launch of a hypersonic

glide vehicle, which is considered more difficult to intercept, into low-Earth orbit. Related

developments are being closely watched.

China is also believed to be aiming to build a “world-class military” by enabling

“intelligentized warfare” through the use of AI and other means, by advancing as national

strategy a Civil-Military Fusion (CMF) development strategy that aims to accelerate two-
way transfer of military and civilian resources.

**Strategic Competition between the U.S. and China and Conflict over Taiwan**

The Biden administration has positioned China as the “most serious competitor” challenging U.S. prosperity, security,

and democratic values, and has made clear its stance to check China through cooperation with allies and partner

countries. In addition, it has positioned economic security as national security, and is further bolstering its efforts to

prevent the diversion of critical and sensitive technologies to strengthen China’s military power. In response, China

has enacted a series of countermeasure laws and regulations. Such strategic competition between the U.S. and China

is having far-reaching international repercussions.

Meanwhile, the conflict between the two countries is also becoming prominent over Taiwan. In April 2021,

the U.S. issued “New Guidelines” to encourage interaction with Taiwanese officials, demonstrating that the U.S. is

committed to accelerating U.S. involvement in Taiwan. The U.S. continues to conduct U.S. warship transits through the

the sea and airspace around Taiwan.

In this situation, besides the U.S., countries in Europe and elsewhere have expressed their interest and concern

in peace and stability in the Taiwan Strait. Taiwan is an extremely important partner for Japan, sharing the same

fundamental values such as freedom and democracy. The stability of the situation surrounding Taiwan is also critical

**North Korea Escalates Provocations against the International Community**

North Korea is believed to already have the capability to attack Japan with ballistic missiles carrying nuclear weapons,

and it continues to develop ballistic missiles at an extremely rapid pace. North Korea has launched a series of ballistic

missiles with irregular trajectories and missiles that it calls “hypersonic missiles,” while diversifying its capabilities

to include rail-launched and submarine-launched missiles. Therefore, North Korea is believed to be focusing on

improving its capability to breach missile defense networks. In addition, especially since the beginning of 2022, while

the international community has been responding to the aggression against Ukraine, North Korea has repeatedly

launched ICBM-class missiles and others at an extremely high frequency, unilaterally escalating provocations against

the international community.

Such military activities in North Korea pose grave and imminent threats to Japan’s security and significantly

undermine the peace and security of the region and the international community. This pattern has only intensified in Image publicly released by North Korea when it

**Russia’s Adoption of a “Strong State” Model,**
**and the China-Russia “Strategic Alliance”**

Russia, which has adopted a “strong state” model, recognizes NATO’s military and other activities in the vicinity of
Russia as a threat. Having ensured that its nuclear capability rivals that of the U.S., the country has been accelerating

the deployment of new weapons, such as planning the mass production and deployment of hypersonic cruise missile

“Zircon” from 2022, and improving its asymmetric warfare capabilities through electronic warfare equipment and

other measures. Russia had deployed Russian military forces in and around Ukraine since fall 2021, after asserting

that it would not allow Ukraine and other former Soviet Union countries to become NATO members. Then, in February

2022, it launched a full-scale aggression against Ukraine.

In the vicinity of Japan, Russia has made moves to strengthen cooperation with China, such as through joint
bomber flights and joint warship sails involving the Russian and Chinese militaries, as well as moves to portray

such military cooperation as “strategic coordination.” These trends warrant concern and must continue to be closely

**Science and Technology Developments and Their Impact on Security**

As technologies rapidly develop, especially those originating in the non-military sector,

their impact on security is attracting attention. For example, the use of technologies such

as AI will further enable unmanned combat and armed forces with fewer personnel, and

may also revolutionize the accuracy and speed of decision-making. Furthermore, there are

already examples of methods for disrupting other countries through diverse means other

than those relying on traditional military force, such as cyber attacks. In this regard, there

is a possibility that gray-zone situations will increase and expand.

Given these trends, countries are increasing their investments in research and

development (R&D) to secure a technological advantage, and are focusing on developing

and utilizing technologies that could become namely game-changing technologies. In GJ-11 stealth unmanned combat aerial vehicle

making supply chains more resilient.

**Increasing Importance of Space, Cyberspace, and Electromagnetic Domains**

Space-based technologies and information and communication networks have become

core infrastructures in people’s everyday lives and for the military. On the other hand,

China, Russia, and other countries are enhancing their capability to interfere with other

countries’ use of space, and these countries and their militaries are reportedly involved in

cyber attacks. Thus, stable use of space and cyberspace has become an important issue

In addition, countries are working to improve their capabilities in space and cyberspace,

along with their capabilities in the electromagnetic domain, under the recognition that these

capabilities are methods of warfare that effectively deter enemies from demonstrating their
war potential.

**Climate Change Requires Response from the International Community**

In recent years, there has been a recognition of the various effects of climate change on

security. For example, it has been pointed out that climate change could undermine the

stability of politically and economically vulnerable nations, which would increase the need

for international assistance, including military operations, for these destabilized nations.

Climate change, which is also described as a “threat multiplier,” thus requires a
collective response from the international community.

**Chapter**
**Basic Concepts of Japan’s Security and Defense** **1**

**Defense Capabilities Protect Japan’s Independence, Peace, and Security**

Peace and security are essential for Japanese people to live with a sense of safety and for

Japan to continue to prosper, but simply wishing for these things is not enough to guarantee

them.

Therefore, Japan ensures its peace and security by strengthening the Japan-U.S.

alliance as well as its own defense capabilities, and by developing a seamless defense

posture. Moreover, from the perspective of preventing the emergence of threats to Japan,

the importance of the role played by defense capabilities is increasing in cooperative efforts

in the Indo-Pacific region.

Recognizing the role of such defense capabilities, Japan ensures its peace and security

by exerting efforts in a variety of fields, including diplomacy and the economy.

In addition, based on its Constitution, Japan has efficiently built a highly effective,

integrated defense force in line with the basic principles of maintaining an exclusively

defense-oriented policy and not becoming a military power that poses a threat to other

countries, while firmly maintaining the Japan-U.S. Security Arrangements, adhering to the

Prime Minister Kishida reviewing units at the FY2021 Troop Review for the

principle of civilian control of the military, and observing the Three Non-Nuclear Principles.

**Japan’s Security and Defense Policy** **2**

**Discussion of All Options for the Development of a New National Security Policy, etc.**

The main documents pertaining to Japan’s national security are the National Security

Strategy (NSS), the National Defense Program Guidelines (NDPG), and the Medium Term

Defense Program (MTDP).
In January 2022, Prime Minister Kishida Fumio announced that these documents

were going to be newly formulated over the year, and they are currently under discussion

among the relevant ministers. The Ministry of Defense (the MOD) established the Defense
Strengthening Acceleration Council, chaired by the Minister of Defense. The Council

discusses all manners of options to protect Japan’s territory, territorial waters, territorial

airspace, and the lives and property of its people.

The current NDPG and MTDP, which were formulated in 2018, call for the establishment

of a “Multi-Domain Defense Force” that will enable cross-domain operations, including
space, cyber and electromagnetic spectrum, as well as flexible and strategic operations at

all stages ranging from peacetime to contingencies.

**Three Pillars of Japan s Defense (Methods**
**Ⅲ**

**Chapter**
**Japan’s Own Architecture for National Defense** **1**

**Japan’s Own Architecture**

**Irreplaceable Role of Defense Capability**

**for National Defense**

Defense capability is the ultimate guarantor of Japan’s national security. Defense capability

represents Japan’s will and ability: to deter threat from reaching Japan; to eliminate a

threat should the threat reach Japan; and to defend to the end Japanese nationals’ lives,

persons and property as well as territorial land, waters and airspace as a sovereign nation,

by exerting efforts on its own accord and initiative. In this sense, defense capability is not

something that can be replaced by any other means.

In light of the increasingly severe and uncertain security environment surrounding

Japan, Japan will build a Multi-Domain Defense Force as a truly effective defense capability.

The Multi-Domain Defense Force will ensure the defense of the nation through cross-

domain operations that organically integrate capabilities in all domains, including space,

cyberspace and electromagnetic spectrum, generating synergy and amplifying overall

capabilities, while at the same time enabling sustained conduct of flexible and strategic

activities during all phases from peacetime to contingencies.

In addition, joint operations are extremely important for the SDF to coordinate

organically and carry out its missions quickly and effectively.

**Japan-U.S. Alliance** **Security Cooperation**

Defense architecture (three pillars)

**Response from Peacetime to**
**Gray Zone Situations**

In order to protect the peace and independence of Japan, the SDF has always been

calmly dealing with acts that infringe Japan’s sovereignty. As part of these efforts, the SDF

conducts constant and continuous intelligence gathering, surveillance, and reconnaissance

activities across the broad area surrounding Japan while striving to prevent the occurrence

or escalation of situations by flexibly selecting deterrence measures and other approaches.
During peacetime, the SDF conducts intelligence gathering and surveillance in Japan’s

territorial waters and airspace, as well as scrambles.

**Defense of Japan including**
**its Remote Islands**

Japan possesses numerous remote islands, and it must position SDF units that suit

the security environment and deploy them according to the situation in order to defend

Japanese nationals’ lives and property, as well as its territory, and other various resources.

If signs of a threat are detected, the SDF will maneuver and deploy units to areas expected
to be invaded to block access and landing of invading forces.

Should any part of our territory be occupied, the SDF will retake it by employing all

necessary measures to suppress the enemy with attacks from aircraft and vessels, and

then the landing of GSDF forces.

**of Achieving Defense Objectives)**

**DIGEST**

**Responses in the Domains of Space, Cyberspace**
**and Electromagnetic Spectrum**

The SDF will prevent interference with its activities in the space, cyberspace, and

electromagnetic domains and promptly limit the extent of damage when such situations

occur. In case of armed attack against Japan, the SDF will block and eliminate the attack

by leveraging capabilities in space, cyber and electromagnetic domains.

With regard to the space domain, the MOD/SDF is building a space situational awareness

system to ensure stable use of space and is improving its capability to gather information

using the space domain. In the cyber domain, the SDF is implementing measures such as

ensuring the safety of information systems and dealing with cyber attacks via specialized

units. In the electromagnetic domain, the SDF is working to reinforce management,

coordination, and information-gathering functions related to the electromagnetic spectrum.

**Response to Large-Scale Disasters**

When disasters occur, the SDF works in collaboration with local governments, engaging

in various activities such as the search and rescue of disaster victims, ships, or aircraft

in distress, and medical treatment. In addition, the SDF carries out missions to evacuate

Japanese nationals and others overseas.

**SDF Activities since Enforcement of**
**Legislation for Peace and Security**

Since the enforcement of Legislation for Peace and Security in 2016, various forms of

preparation and trainings related to this legislation have been implemented. As an example

of actual missions related to this, the SDF has provided asset protection for the U.S. Forces

and other units in accordance with Article 95-2 of the Self-Defense Forces Law. In 2021, the

SDF personnel engaging in life-saving activities

SDF provided asset protection for the Australian Defence Force for the first time.

**Chapter**
**Japan-U.S. Alliance** **2**

**Japan-U.S. Security Arrangements as a Cornerstone for Japan’s Security**

The Japan-U.S. Security Arrangements based on the Japan-U.S. Security Treaty, together

with Japan’s own national defense architecture, constitute a cornerstone for Japan’s
national security. The Japan-U.S. Alliance, with the Japan-U.S. Security Arrangements as

its core, plays a significant role for peace, stability and prosperity of not only Japan but also

the Indo-Pacific region and the international community.

In order to ensure Japan’s peace, security, and sovereignty within the current

international community, Japan has maintained its peace and security, centered on the
security arrangements with the world’s dominant military power, the United States, with

which it has strong economic ties and shares basic values such as democracy, respect for

human rights, the rule of law, and a capitalist economy, as well as interests in maintaining

the peace and security of the world.


-----

**Three Pillars of Japan s Defense (Methods**
**Ⅲ**

The NDPG states that, in order to enhance the ability of the Japan-U.S. Alliance

capabilities to deter and respond, Japan will take all necessary measures to ensure

Japan’s peace and security in all stages from peacetime to contingencies as well as during

disasters. For these purposes, Japan will further enhance various operational cooperation

and policy coordination with the United States.

In particular, Japan will expand and deepen cooperation in: space and cyber domains;

comprehensive air and missile defense; bilateral training and exercises; bilateral ISR

activities; and bilateral flexible deterrent options. Japan will also promote the development

and update of bilateral plans and deepen the Extended Deterrence Dialogue.

Furthermore, in order to create a desirable security environment including maintaining

Japan-U.S. bilateral joint exercise (Keen Edge 22)

and enhancing a free and open maritime order, and with an eye on increasing the Japanese

and U.S. presence in the Indo-Pacific region, Japan and the United States are conducting

Japan-U.S. bilateral activities, such as defense equipment and technology cooperation,

expansion of joint/shared use of U.S. and Japanese facilities and areas, and during this

fiscal year, verification of F-35B take-off and landing to the MSDF’s destroyer JS “Izumo.”

While the presence of USFJ serves as deterrence, it is necessary to consider impacts of

the stationing of the USFJ on living environments of the local residents and to make efforts

in mitigating impacts in a way that applies to the circumstances of each region. In particular,

the realignment of the USFJ is an extremely important initiative to mitigate the impacts on

local communities, including those in Okinawa, while maintaining the deterrent capabilities

of the U.S. Forces. Therefore, the MOD is advancing the realignment and making continued

efforts to gain the understanding and cooperation of the local communities which host USFJ

facilities and areas.

**Chapter**
**Security Cooperation** **3**

**Strategic Promotion of Multi-Faceted and Multi-Layered Defense Cooperation**

The MOD/SDF are promoting bilateral and multilateral defense cooperation and exchanges

under the vision of a Free and Open Indo-Pacific (FOIP). The MOD has shared serious

concern about the situations in the East and South China Seas with these countries, issuing
clear messages to strongly oppose unilateral changes to the status quo by coercion and

such attempts to create faits accomplis.

With respect to Southeast Asia, South Asia, Pacific Island countries, the Middle East,

Africa, and Latin American countries, the MOD/SDF will enhance cooperation to uphold and

reinforce FOIP, utilizing a wide range of means for defense cooperation and exchanges,
including cooperation and exchange of personnel, cooperation and exchange of troops,

capacity building cooperation, and defense equipment and technology cooperation.

The United States, Japan’s ally, and Australia, India, as well as the United Kingdom,

France, Germany, and other European countries, Canada, and New Zealand, are countries

that not only share fundamental values with Japan, but also have geographic and historical

ties to the Indo-Pacific region. The MOD/SDF has been encouraging these countries to

**DIGEST**

become more involved in the Indo-Pacific region while promoting defense cooperation and

exchanges, so that greater impact can be achieved when working together as partners in

the region than could be achieved through unilateral efforts by Japan.

In the space and cyber domains, the MOD/SDF is also reinforcing coordination and

cooperation with concerned countries through information-sharing, discussions, exercises,

and capacity-building, in order to quickly gain superiority and establish international norms

in these domains.

**Ensuring Maritime Security**

Ensuring the safety of maritime traffic is fundamental to the peace and prosperity of

Japan. The SDF has been dispatching the Deployment Surface Force for Counter Piracy

Enforcement and the Deployment Air Force for Counter Piracy Enforcement since 2009 in

order to protect vessels from acts of piracy in the waters off the coast of Somalia and in

the Gulf of Aden. Capacity building (Papua New Guinea)

**Initiatives for Arms Control,**
**Disarmament and Non-Proliferation**

Japan also actively participates in international initiatives for arms control, disarmament,

and non-proliferation pertaining to WMDs, missiles that can deliver them, conventional

arms, and goods and sensitive technologies that can be delivered to military use.

**Efforts to Support International Peace**
**Cooperation Activities**

The MOD/SDF has been proactively undertaking international peace cooperation activities

working in tandem with diplomatic initiatives, including the use of the Official Development

Assistance (ODA) for resolving the fundamental causes of conflicts, terrorism and other

SDF personnel engaging in operations of UNMISS

problems. It has been 30 years since the International Peace Act was enacted.

As a part of its international peace cooperation, the MOD/SDF has dispatched

headquarters personnel to Multinational Force and Observers Mission (MFO; Sinai

Peninsula, Egypt) and the United Nations Mission in South Sudan (UNMISS). In addition,
SDF personnel and civilians have been continually dispatched to the UN Secretariat.

The MOD/SDF has also been carrying out international disaster relief operations from

the perspectives of making humanitarian contributions and improving the global security
environment. In January 2022, the SDF transported disaster relief supplies to the Kingdom

of Tonga, which had been suffering from the damage of a large-scale volcanic eruption.

**Chapter**
**Measures Relating to Training and Exercises** **1**

**Training to Enhance the Deterrence and Response Capability**

In order to fulfill its severe mission of defending Japan, the SDF has been continuously

conducting joint training and various types of training involving the GSDF, MSDF, and ASDF

from peacetime. These exercises range over not only traditional domains, but also new

domains including space, cyberspace and electromagnetic spectrum. The SDF has been

making efforts to improve cross-domain operations in order to successfully utilize these

domains and enhance defense capabilities.

In addition, in order to enhance the deterrence and response capabilities of the

Japan-U.S. Alliance, each service of the SDF conducts bilateral/multilateral training with

the corresponding U.S. military branch, as well as Japan-U.S. bilateral joint exercises,

deepening the content year after year.

Furthermore, in order to strategically promote multi-faceted and multi-layered defense

cooperation based on the vision of a Free and Open Indo-Pacific (FOIP), the SDF is actively

engaged in bilateral training and exercises with allies and friendly nations in the broad

In order to protect Japan’s peace and sovereignty in an increasingly severe security

environment, the SDF must become more powerful on its own while improving its ability to

coordinate with allies and partners. For this reason, the SDF is not content with its current

deterrence and response capabilities and is working to acquire further deterrence and

response capabilities.

**Training to Strengthen Partnerships**

The MOD/SDF recognize that it is indispensable for our eternal peace to stabilize the

security environment surrounding Japan while reinforcing its deterrence and response

capabilities. Based on such recognition, the MOD/SDF is actively promoting bilateral/

multilateral training with allies and partners in the broad Indo-Pacific region. Through
strengthening such partnerships, the MOD/SDF is working to enhance cooperation in order

to respond to global security challenges and destabilizing factors, which are difficult for one

**Capability (Reinforcing the Human Resource Base)**

The core element of defense capability is Self-Defense Forces (SDF) personnel, and securing human resources

for SDF personnel and improving their ability and morale are essential to strengthen defense capability. This has

become an imminent challenge in the face of Japan’s shrinking and aging population with a declining birthrate.

From the perspective of the sustainability and resilience of defense capability, the MOD/SDF is working on

measures to recruit/employ, train and effectively utilize existing human resources of the SDF personnel. The

MOD/SDF is also actively promoting work-life balance and the participation of women.

**Powering Future Defense Policy**
**(Reinforcing Intellectual Infrastructure)**

In order to promote public understanding of security and crisis management, the MOD’s research and educational

institutes are further improving research quality on a day-to-day basis and are reflecting the results in Japan’s

policymaking.

Based on the results of such research, further promoting public understanding of knowledge and information

about Japan’s national security policies has become critical. For this reason, the MOD is reinforcing the research

teams at the National Institute for Defense Studies (NIDS) and other research institutes.

For the MOD/SDF to perform its mission, it is necessary to appropriately manage the health of their personnel

and ensure they remain in good health. The MOD/SDF is working steadfastly to enhance and strengthen their

capabilities in military medicine to maximize the protection of the lives of personnel who respond to a variety
of situations.

For this reason, the MOD/SDF has decided to strengthen the medical treatment and evacuation posture,

which operates seamlessly from the frontline to final evacuation destination, and is working on developing SDF SDF Iruma Hospital
hospitals into medical hubs and enhancing their functionality. In FY2021, the SDF Iruma Hospital opened as part

of these efforts.

As the SDF’s missions become more diverse and internationalized, the SDF aims to appropriately meet the

needs of various medical activities, such as medical support in disaster relief and international peacekeeping

activities, and capacity building in the medical field. In order to strengthen the human infrastructure that forms

the foundation of SDF medical services, the SDF is reinforcing the functions of the National Defense Medical
College and securing and training medical and nursing personnel.

Meanwhile, as part of measures against the coronavirus disease (COVID-19) in Japan, the SDF not only

accepted patients at SDF hospitals, but also set up and managed SDF large-scale vaccination centers in Tokyo

and Osaka from May to November 2021 and has opened SDF vaccination sites from January 2022, in order to

detect the indications of various situations promptly.

To achieve this, the MOD is gathering the following types of intelligence.

(1) Collecting, processing, and analyzing military communication radio waves,

electronic weapons, and other radio waves transmitted in the airspace over

Japan

(2) Collecting, processing, and analyzing of image data from various satellites

(3) Warning and surveillance by warships and aircraft

(4) Collection and organization of various types of published information

(5) Information exchange with defense agencies and other organizations in various

countries

(6) Intelligence-gathering by defense attachés

As of April 1, 2022, 73 defense attachés have been dispatched to 86 embassies and 6

missions and delegations.

**Initiatives to Live in Harmony with Regional Society and the Environment** **6**

**Harmony with Regional Society**

The various activities of the MOD/SDF are hard to implement without the understanding and

cooperation of each and every person, as well as local governments and other organizations.
Based on this idea, the MOD/SDF will continue to promote various measures necessary in

order to further deepen the trust between regional society and people, and the SDF.

**Efforts to Address Environmental Issues**

The MOD/SDF have consistently complied with environmental laws and regulations and MOD emblem symbolizing cooperation between the MOD and regional society
have made efforts to thoroughly protect the environment and reduce environmental impact,

and are promoting further environmental initiatives. In May 2021, the MOD established the

MOD Climate Change Taskforce, chaired by the State Minister of Defense, to evaluate and

analyze the impact of climate change on Japan’s security and extensively study how the

MOD can fulfill its assigned missions and roles. Going forward, the Taskforce will compile a
strategy document for the MOD.

**Public Relations Activities**

In order to gain the trust and the cooperation from the Japanese people and other countries,

the MOD/SDF strives to be proactive in undertaking easily comprehensible public relations
activities regarding its operations in various ways.

**KEY WORD**

**“Gray-Zone Situations” and “Hybrid Warfare”**

The so-called gray-zone situations simply represent a wide range of situations that are neither peacetime nor wartime.
In a gray-zone situation, for example, a country that confronts another over territory, sovereignty or maritime and other economic interests uses some forceful
organization to demonstrate its presence in the relevant disputed region in a bid to alter the status quo or force other countries to accept its assertions or demands.
The so-called “hybrid warfare” represents methods intentionally blurring the boundaries between the military and non-military realms, forcing affected actors
to take complex measures that are not limited to military actions.
The means of hybrid warfare include operations using military units of unidentified nationality, cyber attacks to affect communications and other critical
infrastructure, the spread of false information through the internet and the media, and other influential operations. The combination of these measures is
considered as amounting to hybrid warfare. In hybrid warfare, a country takes measures that are difficult to identify definitively as an “armed attack” based on its
outward appearance. It is said that such an approach is taken with an intent to make it difficult for the target country to address the situation, such as delaying
the military’s initial response, while denying the attacker country’s own involvement.

and economic assistance in exchange for the removal
of nuclear arsenal. Regarding the security assurances
for Ukraine, Russia, the United States, and the United
Kingdom signed the Budapest Memorandum on Security
Assurances in 1993. For economic assistance, various
kinds of assistance were provided as part of support
for dismantling and abolishing nuclear weapons in
former Soviet states, provided mainly by G7 countries,
including Japan. In 1996, all the nuclear arsenal in
Ukraine was transferred to Russia, which means that
Ukraine became a non-nuclear state.[1]

**(2) Ukraine and Relations between Russia and NATO**
Following the collapse of the Soviet Union, Central and
Eastern European countries such as Poland and Czech
Republic hoped to join NATO with the perspective of
securing their independence and security considering
their own historical background, and to participate in
European integration. NATO showed a negative attitude
towards Central and Eastern European countries joining
the alliance immediately, however, with emphasis on
cooperation with Russia. In 1994, NATO announced
the Partnership for Peace (PfP) as a new framework
of cooperation. Ukraine as well as other Central and
Eastern European countries participated in the PfP ahead
of other former Soviet states in terms of promoting
cooperation with NATO and maintaining its neutrality,
and Russia also participated in the framework.
In 1999, Poland, Czech Republic, and Hungary, which
improved their interoperability with NATO, joined the
alliance based on the PfP, which marked the beginning


**1 Security Environment in Europe after**
**the End of the Cold War and Ukraine**

**(1) Building International Consensus on Ukraine’s**
**Territorial Integrity and Non-nuclear Status**

The security environment in Europe was hugely transformed
by regime changes in Eastern European countries in and
after 1989, the end of the Cold War by the Malta Summit in
December of the same year, and the collapse of the Soviet
Union in 1991. This resolved the military confrontation
between the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO)
and the Warsaw Treaty Organization (WTO), which led to
the reduction of the danger of a large-scale war. But new
problems subsequently emerged, such as the intensification
of ethnic separation and independence issues—the
Yugoslav conflict, the Nagorno-Karabakh conflict, and the
Chechen conflict, which started around the collapse of the
Soviet Union—and concern about the proliferation of the
former Soviet Union’s weapons of mass destruction.
Ukraine, which demonstrated willingness to be
independent in a referendum in December 1991, played
an important role in the process of the dissolution of the
Soviet Union along with Russia and Belarus. The breaking
up of the Soviet Union was determined with the founding
declaration of the Commonwealth of Independent States
(CIS) by the three states in the same month.
There were issues over the sovereignty of the Crimean
Peninsula in southern Ukraine and about which country
the Black Sea Fleet, mainly based at Sevastopol on the
peninsula, belongs to between Ukraine and Russia,
which became independent states. In 1997, the two
countries agreed in principle on dividing the fleet and
recognizing Russia’s use of the base for 20 years and
also signed a treaty of amity and cooperation confirming
Ukraine’s territorial integrity and the inviolability of
both countries’ borders.
On the other hand, the management of nuclear
weapons inherited from the former Soviet Union such
as Intercontinental Ballistic Missiles (ICBM) and
strategic bombers became an issue in Ukraine, Belarus
and Kazakhstan. In 1992, Ukraine signed the Lisbon
Protocol for the Strategic Arms Reduction Treaty
(START I) together with Russia, Belarus, Kazakhstan,


The delivery of tactical nuclear weapons to Russia was completed by May 1992. Strategic nuclear weapons—SS-19 (130) and SS-24 (46)—are deployed in Ukraine and their delivery to Russia
was completed by June 1996. In addition, the control of strategic bombers, a vehicle of transporting nuclear weapons, was also transferred to the Ukraine Air Force Long-range Aviation Group

of the so-called eastward expansion of NATO. In 2002
Ukraine also expressed its will to join NATO in the future
both domestically and internationally and embarked on
Defense Ministry and military reforms with NATO’s
cooperation. But because a consensus had not necessarily
been reached within Ukraine on joining NATO by that time
and different attitudes towards joining the alliance were
expressed every time there was a change of government,
Ukraine’s participation in the NATO Membership Action
Plan (MAP) was postponed, although the country’s
joining the alliance in the future was agreed on at the
NATO summit in Bucharest, Romania, in 2008.
Meanwhile, Russia and NATO had a certain level of
cooperative relationship at that time, as shown by Russia’s
participation in the PfP and the cooperation between
NATO and Russia in the Bosnian conflict. In addition,
Russia was treated differently from Central and Eastern
European countries and other former Soviet states in terms
of the relationship with NATO, and in 1997 the NATORussia Permanent Joint Council (PJC) was established as a
framework of sharing what was determined within NATO
with Russia. In 2002, the PJC was reorganized into the
NATO-Russia Council (NRC), which allowed Russia to
participate in a certain level of decision-making in common
areas of interest as an equal NATO partner.
With Russia having this level of cooperation with
NATO, Russia did not necessarily continue to strongly
oppose NATO member states eastward expansion. In its
2000 military doctrine, Russia regarded as threats the
expansion of a military bloc and an alliance that could
damage its military security and explicitly evaluated
NATO as a threat in its 2010 military doctrine and
beyond. But Russia eventually acquiesced the Baltic
states joining NATO in 2004 when the Russian president
was Putin, who is now leading the Russia’s aggression
against Ukraine. It is also necessary to note that Russia
and NATO basically had a relationship of cooperation,
including their Air Forces conducting joint exercises,[2]
except for a certain time after the 2008 Russo-Georgian
War until NATO and European countries halted in
principle their working-level cooperation with Russia,


including military cooperation, with the exception of
ambassador-level NRC meetings as a result of Russia’s
illegal “annexation” of the Autonomous Republic of
Crimea in southern Ukraine in 2014.

**(3)** **The “Annexation” of Crimea and Conflict in Eastern Ukraine**
Following a political upheaval in Ukraine in February
2014, armed forces purported to be Russian troops
occupied the Council of Ministers building and the
Parliamentary building in the Autonomous Republic
of Crimea in southern Ukraine and also took control
of airports and highways leading to the mainland of
Ukraine, and major Ukrainian military installations.
After taking de facto control of the Autonomous
Republic of Crimea, Russia illegally “annexed” Crimea
in March of the same year following the results of a
“referendum” held in the republic.
Meanwhile, in April 2014, separatists and other
forces increased their protests and attacks against an
interim Ukrainian government in eastern Ukraine and
occupied many buildings, including the Council of
Ministers buildings. In response to this situation, the
interim Ukrainian government condemned Russia over
its alleged involvement and mobilized military forces
in an attempt to expel the occupying forces, but failed
to settle the situation. In May 2014, a “referendum”
was held for or against expanding autonomy under the
control of the separatist forces in parts of the Donetsk
and Luhansk regions in eastern Ukraine. Because the
negotiations between Ukrainian government and the
separatist forces failed to reach a breakthrough, the
Ukrainian forces continued fighting with the separatists
receiving a range of support, including purported
Russian direct intervention.
In September 2014 and February 2015, the Organization
for Security and Co-operation in Europe (OSCE), Russia,
and Ukraine signed “the Minsk agreements”[3] for making
peace. But sporadic fighting continued in the ensuing
years with no progress in the implementation of many
of the matters stipulated by the agreements, causing an
estimated more than 10,000 casualties.


The NATO-Russia air force joint exercise “Vigilant Skies” was conducted from 2011 to 2013 as part of cooperation in the NATO-Russia Council (NRC).

The Minsk Protocol of September 2014 consists of the following items: (1) ensure the immediate bilateral cessation of the use of weapons; (2) ensure monitoring and verification by the
Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe (OSCE) of the regime of non-use of weapons; (3) enact the Law of Ukraine “With respect to the temporary status of local self- government in
certain areas of the Donetsk and Luhansk regions” (Law on Special Status); (4) ensure monitoring on the Ukrainian-Russian state border and verification by the OSCE, together with the creation
of a security area in the border regions of Ukraine and the Russian Federation; (5) immediately release all hostages and unlawfully detained persons; (6) prohibit the prosecution and punishment
of persons in connection with the events that took place in certain areas of the Donetsk and Luhansk regions; (7) conduct an inclusive national dialogue; (8) adopt measures aimed at improving
the humanitarian situation in Donbas; (9) ensure the holding of early local elections in the Donetsk and Luhansk regions; (10) remove unlawful military formations, military hardware, as well as
militants and mercenaries from the territory of Ukraine; (11) adopt a program for the economic revival of Donbass and the recovery of economic activity in the region; and (12) provide personal

**(4) Ukrainian Defense Efforts in and after 2014**
Following the Russian illegal “annexation” of Crimea in
2014 and the outbreak of the eastern Ukrainian conflict,
Ukraine shifted its defense policy dramatically to build up
its defense capability. The conscription system, abolished
in 2013, was revived and the number of military personnel,
planned to be reduced to approximately 100,000 by 2014,
was increased to approximately 250,000 in 2015.
For its relations with NATO, Ukraine abandoned its
previous non-alignment policy in December 2014 and
expressed its will to deepen its relations with NATO
and seek the alliance. Ukraine accelerated its Defense
Ministry and military structural reforms aiming for NATO
standards and strived to build up its military capability with
educational and training support from the United States,
the United Kingdom, Canada, and other countries. In
addition, Lithuanian-Polish-Ukrainian Brigade, primarily
aimed at participating in UN PKO, was established from
2014 to 2016, although its formation was agreed on in
2009 but remained unrealized. Ukraine also continued to
conduct joint exercises with NATO states, including the
Rapid Trident exercise jointly with the U.S. Army, which
started in 1996, and the Sea Breeze exercise jointly with
the U.S. Navy, which started in 1997, and made progress
in its efforts for practically improving its interoperability
with NATO.

**2 The Situation Surrounding Ukraine**
**after the Spring of 2021**

**(1) Military Tension in the Spring of 2021**
From March to April 2021, about one year before the
Russia’s aggression against Ukraine, Russia massed
many troops around its border with Ukraine and on the
Crimea Peninsula, which it had illegally “annexed,”
and conducted large-scale exercises, including landing
and counter-landing exercises on the peninsula. Starting
from late March 2021, the Russian Ministry of Defense
announced one by one the status of implementation
of inspection of combat readiness in the Southern and
Western Military Districts, and military tensions rose
in the region until the ministry announced the end of
the inspection on April 22. In addition, in ending the


inspection, the equipment of Central Military District
units that participated in the inspection of combat
readiness was left as they were because they would
participate in the Zapad 2021 strategic exercise,
scheduled to be conducted in the fall of 2021, in an
effort to strengthen the Russian military’s deployment
readiness around the Ukrainian border. The Ukrainian
Ministry of Defense pointed out that the massed Russian
troops were as large as the ones deployed from 2014 to
2015 and stated the evaluation that 76 Battalion Tactical
Groups (BTG)[4] consisting of approximately 150,000
troops were concentrated. Then Ukraine Minister
of Defence Andriy Taran, in stating analyses of the
purposes of Russia concentrating its troops, mentioned
securing Crimean water sources and expanding the
areas controlled by the pro-Russian separatist forces in
eastern Ukraine—a scenario partially coinciding with
Russian military operations in the country’s aggression
against Ukraine in 2022.

**(2) The Situation after the Summer of 2021**
Russia later continued with various actions that could
be considered to be intended to increase pressure on
Ukraine and its supporting countries. On June 2, 2021,
prior to the Ukraine and U.S. Navy joint Sea Breeze 2021
exercise, the Russian Ministry of Defense announced its
counteractions against the exercise, later making public
exercises and training in the region bordering the Black
Sea, including the Crimean Peninsula, and announcing
on June 25 the start of the Navy and the Aerospace
Force joint exercises in the eastern Mediterranean Sea
based at the AFRF bases in Syria.
In July 2021, President Putin published an article titled
“On the Historical Unity of Russians and Ukrainians,”
making public his original claim denying that Ukraine
exists as an independent nation-state separately from
Russia.
In September 2021, the Zapad 2021 strategic exercise
was conducted in Russia’s Western Military District and
Belarus, which border Ukraine.
Meanwhile, Ukraine conducted the Sea Breeze 2021
joint exercise with the U.S. Navy from June to July
2021, the first Cossack Mace joint exercise with the


The Battalion Tactical Group (BTG), with one motorized rifle (mechanized infantry) battalion (made up of two to four companies) assigned to maneuvers being its core, is a Russian combined arms
unit (over three companies) that significantly reinforced artillerymen and multiple rockets originally assigned to a division or a brigade, higher forces, as well as one tank company. Engineers and
air defense and logistics support forces were added to the group according to duties and the group was flexibly assembled with 600 to 1,500 personnel. The BTG is a form of force organization
introduced to increase troop readiness and fire power support on the basis of the experiences of the Chechen conflict and the Georgia conflict, and as of August 2021 168 BTGs were operational

British Army in July 2021, and the Rapid Trident 2021
joint exercise with the U.S. Army in September 2021,
involving many participating countries, mainly NATO
member states.

**(3)** **The Rekindling of Military Tension after the Fall of 2021**
It is pointed out that after late October 2021, more than
one month after the end of the Zapad 2021 strategic
exercise, U.S. and U.K. intelligence authorities released


surface missiles equipped with conventional warheads
such as Kalibr and Iskander as well as with strategic
nuclear forces. Through these series of exercises, Russia
further increased military tension in the region and used
the exercises as an opportunity to mass troops around
Ukraine.
On February 21, 2022, President Putin held a Security
Council meeting and confirmed that the senior members
of his administration approved of the recognition of the

and the coast of the Sea of Azov without carrying out
thorough missile attacks and securing air superiority.
Regarding the reasons why Russian troops did not carry
out thorough missile attacks, some point out that the
Russian military might have had optimistic assessments
that they would be able to discourage Ukraine from
resisting and incapacitate the Ukrainian military with
missile attacks and simultaneous ground invasions on
multiple fronts and that the Russian military might have
been lacking adequate targeting capability for missile
attacks such as reconnaissance satellites in addition to
the problem on its insufficient supply capability caused
by the limitation of missile production capability.
Furthermore, poor coordination between the Russian
Land Force and the Aerospace Force due to the lack
of inter-service joint operation capabilities, and the
separate commanding structure by different military
districts for each operational front due to the absence of
a unified commanding authority, lead to the lack of air
support for ground units as well as too stretched posture
and piecemeal attacks of ground forces. It could be seen
that these are the major factors that allowed Armed
Forces of Ukraine (AFU) and State Border Guards to
repel each Russian units separately. Ukraine’s Deputy
Defense Minister Hanna Maliar announced as of about
one and a half days after Russia started its aggression
against Ukraine that the Russian side had lost 2,800
personnel, up to 80 tanks, and 516 armored combat
vehicles. It is pointed out that these huge Russian losses
were caused by the Ukrainian military making effective
use of equipment including antitank missiles provided
by the United States and other NATO member states.
The Russian military not only started its ground
invasion on the same day as missiles attacks but also
occupied Hostomel Airport in northwestern Kyiv by
airborne units on the day of the start of invasion and
attempted to invade Kyiv by light armored units on the
day after the start of invasion. These moves imply that
Russia planned to remove the Zelenskyy administration
by initially seizing the capital Kyiv. From the earliest
stage of the Russian aggression, President Zelenskyy
clearly and consistently showed his intention to stay
in Kyiv, resulting in a failed attempt by Russia to

As factors that led Russia to invade Ukraine, political
ones, including Russia’s recognition of NATO’s
eastward expansion as a threat, are pointed out. In
particular, if Ukraine and Georgia joined NATO on
their own will after other Central and Eastern European
countries and the Baltic states, Russia would lose more
of its buffer zones with NATO on the western border.
Also, if Ukraine sought to practically increase its
military capabilities and interoperability with NATO
by developing its cooperation with the alliance with the
will to join, even if there was no prospect for them to
join, it would imperil Ukraine as a Russian “sphere of
influence,” which Russia considered unacceptable.
On the other hand, it is pointed out that some more
military factors directly led Russia to decide to invade
Ukraine. Namely, it is conceivable that Russia might
have had an optimistic assessment about Ukraine’s will
and military capability to resist invaders based on its
successful experience of “annexing” Crimea in 2014
and on that Russia had grown increasingly confident
about the Russian military capability improvements
through structural reforms and modernization under the
Putin administration.[5]

In the initial phase of its aggression against Ukraine,
the Russian military launched missile attacks to destroy
Ukrainian air defense systems and air power. But Russian
troops started ground invasions on multiple fronts, from
northern Ukraine and the northeastern border to the
capital Kyiv, from the eastern border to Kharkiv, and
from the Crimean Peninsula to Kherson, Zaporizhzhia,


As an example of explanations for the reasons why Russian political and military leaders, including President Putin, decided to invade Ukraine, on March 8, 2022, William Burns, Director of the
Central Intelligence Agency (CIA), said during a House Intelligence Committee hearing: Putin judged the situation as suitable for the use of force against Ukraine on the basis of the following
assumptions: (1) Ukraine is so weak that it can easily be intimidated; (2) Public attention will be distracted from the Ukraine situation in Europe, especially France and Germany, due to a presidential
election and a change of government; (3) The Russian economy will be able to weather the sanctions; and (4) Russia’s modernized military can win in a quick and decisive manner at minimum

quickly take control of the capital as the AFU rebuffed
the advance of Russian main forces at the suburbs of
the city. Furthermore, Russian main forces attempting
to advance to Kyiv from Belarusian and Russian
borders finally withdrew on all fronts of the capital,
notably because of their poor logistics and the strong
resistance of Ukrainian Forces. In addition, on February
27, 2022, Russian troops also attempted to invade
Kharkiv, Ukraine’s second largest city in the east and
an important point of transport, by light armored units,
but failed to take quick control of the city in the face of
Ukrainian counter attacks. After failing to seize these
large cities in initial battles, the AFRF further intensified
their indiscriminate attacks against noncombatants,
including bombarding residential areas by multiple
rockets. In addition, it is considered that war crimes were
committed by Russian troops, including the slaughter
of civilians, in the areas seized by the Russian military,
including the suburbs of Kyiv.
Meanwhile, it can be pointed out that the Russian
military expanded its occupied areas in southern
Ukraine adjacent to the Crimean Peninsula illegally
“annexed” by Russia in 2014 more quickly than in other
areas—due to such factors as relatively few logistical
issues, easy access to air support within the range of
ground-to-air missiles deployed on the peninsula, the
mainland of Russia and the Black Sea, and relatively flat
terrains. But the AFU announced that it attacked Russian
military convoys of logistical vehicles by the Bayraktar
TB2, an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV), near Kherson
and that it is intermittently attacking Chornobaivka
Airport, which Russian forces have occupied and used
as an attack base by artillery and multiple rockets with
reconnaissance and artillery observation by the UAV.
It is probable that the AFRF have failed to expand its
occupied areas significantly, although it keeps the
areas it seized in two weeks or so after the start of the
aggression against Ukraine.

**2 Russia’s Attack on Nuclear Power**
**Stations and Nuclear facilities and**
**the Situation Surrounding Nuclear,**
**Biological, and Chemical Weapons**

As shown by the statement made by Russian Defense
Minister Sergei Shoigu at the meeting of President


Putin s Security Council held on February 21, 2022, prior
to Russia’s aggression against Ukraine, Russia claimed
that Ukraine might develop nuclear weapons contrary
to the reality. In fact, however, it was Russia that took
a dangerous action over nuclear substances and nuclear
facilities. Russia occupied the Chornobyl nuclear power
plant near the Belarusian border on February 24, 2022,
and also attacked and occupied the Zaporizhzhia nuclear
power plant in southeastern Ukraine on March 4, 2022.
In addition, Russia attacked Kharkiv Institute of Physics
and Technology (the KIPT), which has testing nuclear
reactors and deals with nuclear substances, multiple
times on and after March 6, 2022.
For nuclear weapons, on February 27, 2022,
President Putin ordered Russian Defense Minister
Sergei Shoigu and Chief of the General Staff of the
AFRF Valery Gerasimov to put the deterrence forces
on high combat alert having nuclear forces in mind. On
March 22, 2022, President Putin’s spokesman Dmitry
Peskov made a statement to the effect that Russia
could use nuclear weapons if it faced a threat where its
survival is at stake. In addition, on April 20, 2022, the
Russian military conducted its first flight test of the new
Sarmat heavy intercontinental ballistic missile (ICBM)
in development, and President Putin made a statement
showing off his country’s nuclear force.
Russia has repeatedly claimed that Ukraine may
use chemical and biological weapons. But the United
States and the United Kingdom evaluate it as showing
that Russia is preparing for the so-called “false flag
campaign.”[6]

**3 Russia’s Downward Revision of**
**Its Operational Goals and a Future**
**Outlook**

The AFRF, which practically failed to take initial control
of the capital Kyiv, withdrew the Kyiv area troops to
Belarus and the territory of Russia. On March 25, 2022,
Russia announced that its previous military action had
been at “the first phase of operation” and that the primary
goal of its operation would shift to the “liberation” of the
Donetsk and Luhansk oblasts in eastern Ukraine, that is,
expanding occupied areas in the regions. This represented
a practical downward revision of war purposes.
On April 9, 2022, the BBC reported, as a piece

of information from a western authority, that Gen.
Dvornikov, the commander of the Southern Military
District, who had commanded the Russian Task Force
in Syria in the past, was assigned to Captain General
for the Ukraine aggression. While this assignment is
seen as an action to integrate operational command, it
is anticipated that the problem on operational command
of Russian Forces will persist in the future, because
motley troops in Ukraine including ones from the AFRF,
National Guard (former Internal Troops), Federal
Security Service (FSB), and several paramilitary groups
such as Kadyrovtsy which is affiliated with the Head
of the Chechen Republic Kadyrov, make the integration
difficult.
The AFRF reorganized the units it had withdrawn
from the Kyiv area in Belarus and Russian territory
and is considered to have started deploying the units
gradually to eastern Ukraine in mid-April, 2022.
According to a statement from General Staff of the AFU
on May 3, 2022, the Russian troops conducting offensive
operations in Eastern Ukraine initially included the 1st
Tank Army and the 20th Army of the Western Military
District of Russian Land Force in the area including
Kharkiv, and then included the 29th Army, the 35th
Army, and the 36th Army of the Eastern Military District
that participated in the attack of Kyiv, and, furthermore,
the 68th Corps that had stationed in Southern Sakhalin
and Northern Territories of Japan. In addition, Russian
troops encircled Mariupol, Ukraine’s last stronghold in
southern Donetsk oblast on the coast of the Sea of Azov,
and attempted to seize the city by bombing and shelling
with no attention to the damage to noncombatants. It
is probable that Russian forces are planning to occupy
main cities in eastern and southern Ukraine, such as
Zaporizhzhia and Dnipro on the east of the Dnieper River
and Mykolaiv and Odesa on the west of the Dnieper,
using Kherson on the western bank of the Dnieper, a
main city they had occupied, as strongholds. On April
22, 2022, Gen. Minnekaev, the Deputy Commander
of Russia’s Central Military District, said that their
current operational goal was to take complete control of
southern Ukraine as well as the Donetsk and Luhansk
Oblasts in eastern Ukraine. He claimed that this move
was intended not only to secure land corridors between
the mainland of Russia and the Crimean Peninsula,
which was illegally “annexed” in 2014, but also to


cut off Ukraine s access to maritime trade and secure
communication with eastern Moldova’s Transnistria
region controlled by pro-Russian separatist forces. This
also means that Russian forces are possibly planning
to divide Ukraine. The AFRF are continuing with their
missile attacks on many parts of Ukraine, including
western Ukraine, at the same time and are considered to
be seeking to undermine and deprive Ukrainians of their
will to resist by destroying Ukrainian military logistics
and increasing noncombatant casualties.
In response to these Russian attacks, the AFU are
continuing with its counterattacks and reportedly sank
Russian Black Sea Fleet flagship Slava-class missile
cruiser, the Moskva, by the domestically produced
Neptune surface-to-ship cruise missile on April 13,
2022, in southern Ukraine where Russian forces were
purported to have achieved relatively large military
successes. On April 30, Ukrainian troops also shelled
a Russian command post in Izium in the Kharkiv oblast
in eastern Ukraine where Chief of the General Staff
of the AFRF Valery Gerasimov was purported to stay.
And on May 12, 2022, Ukraine troops attacked Russian
troops attempting to cross the Donets river. According
to the assessment of the British Ministry of Defence,
Russian Army is considered to have lost at least one
BTG with this attack. It is pointed out that the AFRF,
which are more advantaged in terms of troop strength
and equipment, have problems with morale and logistics
as well as operations and tactics, whereas the AFU are
considered to continue with their counterattacks with
support from various countries as well as with their
strong will to resist. While it is pointed out that the war
may drag on, there is a possibility that Ukraine will
counter attack slowly, considering that some areas are
being taken back by the AFU.
Before the start of Russia’s aggression against
Ukraine, some predicted that Russia, far more
advantaged in terms of military power, would gain
air superiority by intensively deploying long-range
precision strike capabilities, such as cruise missiles
and strategic bombers they had showed off during their
operations in Syria since 2015, and then force Ukraine
into submission in a few days by sending ground troops.
In fact, however, it is said that the Russian military is
relatively sluggish in its missile and air attacks and
has failed to gain air superiority. It is also pointed out


**Chapter**
**2**


-----

that the AFRF suffered huge losses because they did
not concentrate ground troops on particular fronts
and conducted piecemeal deployments to multiple
fronts, which caused some to question the Russian
military’s operational capability in a large-scale war. In
addition, it is considered that Russian cyber attacks and
electronic warfare have not been as effective as initially
expected. It is also conceivable that the so-called
hybrid warfare instruments, such as false flag campaign

Eurasian Continent where Russia occupies. In addition,
the change in the European situation in response to the
Russia’s aggression against Ukraine can also have an
impact on global affairs including developments of the
strategic competition between the United States and
China and impact on Asia. In any case, it is necessary to
monitor the related situations closely with great interest.

**2 Responses by NATO Member States**
**and Other Countries**

European countries’ views of Russia have varied due
to differences in their economic relations with Russia
and geographical distances. When Russia “annexed”
Crimea in February 2014, the international community
could not necessarily show a coordinated strong stand
against Russia, with the United States, the United
Kingdom, the Baltic states, and Poland with a keen
sense of threat towards Russia taking a hardline stand
against Russia, Germany and Italy taking a relatively
conciliatory approach, and France pursuing dialogue
with Russia. In contrast, the Russia’s aggression against
Ukraine generated a rapidly growing alarm amid
European countries and Russia’s aggressive actions
are being viewed as a threat to European and northern
Atlantic security.[9]

In this respect, NATO member states, which
reaffirmed Russia’s threat, sought to strengthen their
deterrent power and announced to deploy NATO
Response Force (NRF) to the East Europe region for
the purpose of reassurance after an extraordinary virtual
summit in February 2022, and decided to establish four
additional battlegroups in Bulgaria, Romania, Hungary,
and Slovakia respectively at an extraordinary NATO
summit in March 2022. In addition, the Global Posture
Review, released in November 2021, clearly states
that the U.S. military will strengthen combat-credible
deterrent against Russia’s aggression and enable NATO
forces to operate more effectively. The 25,000 activeduty force cap in Germany was also rescinded to allow
for permanent stationing of an Army Multi-Domain Task


Force and other personnel in Germany. It is important
to pay attention to the future developments of the U.S.
military in response to the Russia’s aggression against
Ukraine.
Meanwhile, NATO member states, including the
United States, are also taking a cautious attitude towards
deployment of troops to Ukraine, those countries provide
indirect support through supplying defense equipment
and other measures.[10] More specifically, NATO member
states have provided equipment including man portable
antitank and anti-air missiles which are thought to
contribute to helping Ukrainian forces delay the
advancement of Russian armored forces and prevent the
expansion of their battle fronts by diminishing Russian
troops such as their airborne units. NATO member
states are also boosting the provision of heavy weapons,
including tanks, armored vehicles, and howitzers, which
enhance Ukrainian counterattack capabilities against
Russian aggression. Among others, the United States
announced a total of more than four billion dollars in
security assistance to Ukraine by late April 2022 after
the inauguration of the Biden administration—more than
3.4 billion dollars after Russia had started its aggression
against Ukraine. The United States has provided
Ukraine with a significant amount of equipment, such
as antitank missiles, surface-to-air missiles, howitzers,
loitering munitions, and air surveillance radars. For
some equipment, the United States mentioned that it has
helped train Ukrainian soldiers in its continent and other
areas. In addition, on 24 April, Secretary of State Antony
Blinken and Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin visited
Kyiv where they met with Ukraine President Volodymyr
Zelenskyy and expressed their will to provide strong
support to Ukraine, announcing financial support for
the procurement of equipment to Ukraine and Eastern
European countries. Moreover, satellite Internet services
provided by U.S. companies in response to the request
from the Ukrainian government are used not only as
a means of communications for the Ukrainian people
but also are utilized to operate the Ukrainian military’s
UAV. Such support for Ukraine using civilian cuttingedge technologies attracts attention as a noticeable form


9 In March 2022, the European Council adopted a “Strategic Compass” laying out a common strategic vision for security and defense policies in the next five to ten years. In this document the EU
declares that “Russia unprovoked and unjustified military aggression against Ukraine that grossly violates international law and the principles of the UN Charter and undermines European and
global security and stability” and regards Russia as a “long-term and direct threat.”

10 On April 26, 2022, US Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin said that the United States and its allies had provided more than five million dollars’ worth of equipment since the start of the Russia’s
aggression against Ukraine. On the other hand, on the same day, Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov expressed his opposition to NATO member states’ defense equipment supplies to Ukraine,
claiming that NATO’s supply of weapons to Ukraine in essence meant that the Western alliance was engaged in a proxy war with Russia and that those equipment would be a legitimate target for

of assistance.
The United Kingdom has continuously provided
Ukraine with equipment and has dispatched instructors
to the country together with the United States and other
countries since Russia’s “annexation” of Crimea in
2014. After the Russia’s aggression against Ukraine
as well, the United Kingdom announced that it would
provide Ukraine with equipment, such as UK-made
man portable antitank guided weapons, surface-toair missiles, anti-ship missiles, armored vehicles, and
electronic warfare devices. In April 2022, UK Prime
Minister Boris Johnson visited Kyiv where he met
with Ukraine President Volodymyr Zelenskyy and
announced that his country would supply more military
equipment. The United Kingdom expressed strong
cooperation with a continued strong sense of alarm
towards Russia. In addition, France, which acted as a
mediator between Russia and Ukraine together with
Germany in the “Normandy format”[11] aiming to bring
the conflict in eastern Ukraine to a peaceful resolution,
met with both Russian and Ukrainian leaders in early
February 2022 as part of active diplomacy. Furthermore,
France reacted strongly against Russia, which started its
aggression against Ukraine right in the middle of the
negotiations, and announced on 26 February that the
country would provide Ukraine with military equipment
and 300 million euro in assistance. Although Germany
had initially shown reluctance to export military
equipment to Ukraine in accordance with the principle
of disapproving of the export of military equipment
to countries in conflict, it shifted its policy after the
Russia’s aggression against Ukraine and announced
from February to early April 2022 that it would supply
Ukraine with military equipment, such as antitank
missiles and surface-to-air missiles. After that, Germany
maintained a relatively cautious attitude towards
Ukraine as it continued denying direct supplies of their
heavy weapons including tanks, and announced it would
supply Eastern European countries with weapons in
compensation of their supplies of heavy weapons from
former Soviet Union to Ukraine. Germany later changed
its policy to also supply heavy weapons to Ukraine and
announced supplies of weapons such as self-propelled
anti-aircraft guns and self-propelled howitzers. Other
NATO member states also announced that they would


supply a considerable amount of military equipment.
Some Central and Eastern European countries, which are
considered to have a keen sense of alarm towards Russia
due to their historical circumstances and geographical
relations, have expressed active support to Ukraine.
In addition, non-NATO member states also provide
Ukraine with military equipment and other assistance.
For example, Sweden and Finland have announced
that they will supply antitank weapons and Australia
announced by late April 2022 that it would provide a
total of approximately 191.5 million Australian dollars
in military assistance, including the supply of Australiamade wheeled armored vehicles. In particular, Sweden
has decided to supply military equipment against
its principle of not supplying weapons to countries
involved in a conflict.
Moreover, the Russia’s aggression against Ukraine has
prompted NATO member states to strive to strengthen
defense cooperation within the collective defense
architecture of NATO and make efforts to build up their
defense capabilities. At an extraordinary NATO summit
on March 2022 after the Russia’s aggression against
Ukraine, NATO announced that they would accelerate
defense investment and strengthen individual and
collective capacity with countries that resist all forms
of attack. Many NATO member states are shifting to
increase defense expenditures. Among others, Germany
made a particularly dramatic shift in its defense policy
as a result of the Russia’s aggression against Ukraine.
On February 27, 2022, German Chancellor Olaf Scholz
announced that his country would increase the rate of
defense spending to GDP from the current 1.5% or so
to more than 2% and keep it that way. In addition, the
German government has decided to appropriate 100
billion euro to create a special fund for strengthening
defense capability in the federal budget for FY 2022 and
plans to revise the Basic Law for the Federal Republic
of Germany to secure the financial resources necessary
for the measures. Moreover, public opinion in Sweden
and Finland, which are countries that have maintained
military neutrality and are non-NATO member states, has
rapidly been leaning towards joining NATO following
the Russia’s aggression against Ukraine. The views in
favor of admission to NATO in polls are reaching a
majority for the first time. In a joint press conference

in April 2022, the leaders of these two countries stated
that the Russia’s aggression against Ukraine marked
a dramatic turning point in their security environment
and announced that their countries would proceed with
considering joining NATO. In May 18, 2022, Sweden
and Finland both submitted their applications to join
NATO. NATO member states including the United States
and the United Kingdom welcomed the applications and
stated their will to support the two countries.[12]

While many NATO member states and other countries
strengthen their solidarity like this, Turkey, which is also
a NATO member state, is considered to pursue its own
standing. Turkey, having deep relations with both Russia
and Ukraine, expressed support to Ukraine after the start
of the Russia’s aggression but also showed consideration
for Russia by, for example, not imposing sanctions, and
acts as a mediator for the ceasefire talks between the two
countries. On February 28, 2022, the Turkish Minister of
Foreign Affairs stated that his country would implement
the provisions of the so-called Montreux Convention[13]
that prescribes navigation rights in the Turkish Straits
(consisting of the Bosphorus strait, the Sea of Marmara,
and the Dardanelles Strait), and announced on the
following day that some Russian warships cancelled
the passage of the straits. On the other hand, Ukraine
forces is said to still effectively use Turkish Bayraktar
TB2 UAV during Russia’s aggression, after its first time
use in actual warfare in Eastern Ukraine in October
2021. Mr. Peskov, the spokesman of the Presidential
Executive Office of Russia, warns that the use of this
UAV is making the area unstable.


Emirates (UAE) abstaining. In addition, on March 2
of the same year, the UN General Assembly adopted a
resolution deploring the Russian invasion of Ukraine
and demanding that Russia immediately withdraw its
forces from Ukraine by 141 countries in favor. On the
other hand, Belarus, Syria, North Korea, and Eritrea
as well as Russia voted against the resolution and 35
countries, including China and India, abstained. As
shown by this, while the majority of the international
community showed a critical attitude regarding Russia’s
aggression against Ukraine, some countries and regions
disagreed with this position.
China has taken the position that it is not concerned
with Russia’s plans for aggression against Ukraine.
However, China has not blamed Russia, and insisted that
Russia’s actions are caused by the “Cold War mentality”
of the NATO member states including United States,
and that it understands Russia’s reasonable concerns
on security issues. Furthermore, China emphasizes that
both China and Russia have made it clear that the socalled “provision of military assistance to Russia by the
Chinese side” is complete disinformation. U.S. National
Security Advisor Jake Sullivan and Yang Jiechi a
member of the Central Politburo of the Communist Party
of China, had a meeting of a few hours in Rome, Italy,
on March 14, 2022 concerning the Russian’s aggression
against Ukraine since that February, during which the
U.S. emphasized the risk of China’s cooperation with
Russia. In response to this, China emphasized that it
was providing Ukraine with emergency humanitarian
assistance and would continue with its own efforts with
contribution to promoting mediation and dialogue. In
recent years, China and Russia have been promoting their
mutual cooperation in the military field. For example,
in November 2021, China and Russia announced that
they had agreed on strengthening bilateral military
cooperation for strategic military exercises and patrols at
a bilateral defense ministers’ online meeting. In addition,
in joint statements by China and Russia in February
2022, the two confirmed their mutually supportive
stances regarding each other’s “core interests,” with

12 Russia strongly opposed to the application of Sweden and Finland for NATO membership. On May 12, 2022, The Ministry of Foreign Affairs of Russia warned that it will have to take “militarytechnical” steps in response to the application, and President Putin stated to Mr. Niinistö, the president of Finland, that “the abandonment of Finland’s traditional policy of military neutrality would
be an error” in a telephone conversation on May 14. In addition, Turkey had reservation to the application of Sweden and Finland because of the two countries’ support to Kurdish groups that are
conflicting with Turkish government.

13 Turkey has significant authority over both the Bosphorus and the Dardanelles based on the Montreux Convention of 1936. Article 19 of the Montreux Convention forbids belligerent nations’
warships from passing through the straits in time of war, but permits those warships to sail through the straits to return to their bases. Furthermore, in time of war, the convention stipulated that
should Turkey be in a state of belligerency (Articles 20) and considers itself to be threatened with imminent danger of war (Article 21), the passage of warships shall be left entirely to the discretion

China, following Russia, declaring opposition to
NATO’s expansion to the east, and Russia expressing
respect for the “One China” policy and opposition to
any form of independence of Taiwan. Russia, which
is internationally isolated with its aggression against
Ukraine and has sustained significant losses, especially
in its ground forces, will likely find its political and
military cooperation with China more important than
ever. Even before the Russia’s aggression against
Ukraine, Russia had moved to strengthen its military
cooperation with China in the area surrounding Japan,
such as joint flight of bombers and joint navigations of
naval vessels by the Russian and Chinese militaries. In
response to Russia’s aggression against Ukraine, it is
necessary to monitor the possibility of deeper military
cooperation between China and Russia with concern,
including cooperation in the Far East and East Asia
where the two countries are situated.

See Chapter 3, Section 2-3 (Relations with Countries and Regions)

See

the column in Chapter 3, Section 5-5 (The developments
of the military cooperation between Russia and China: The
repercussions of “strategic coordination”)

In addition, it is pointed out in Taiwan that the Russia’s
aggression against Ukraine may affect Chinese Taiwan
policy. Meanwhile, Taiwanese President Tsai Ingwen says that the situations surrounding Ukraine and
Taiwan are fundamentally different and has given
instructions about raising their early warning of
military developments around the Taiwan Strait and
strengthening their response to “cognitive warfare” by
“external forces” against Taiwan. Tsai emphasized the
importance of national defense by the unity of the whole
Taiwanese people and ordered the Ministry of National
Defense to continue to conduct a rolling review of
implementation and progress of the new reservist
training system whose education and call-up period was
extended experimentally in 2022. In addition, Taiwan
Defense Minister Chiu Kuo-cheng announced following
the Russia’s aggression against Ukraine that he would
incorporate the Ukrainian experience into part of his
asymmetrical warfare plan continuously strengthening
asymmetrical forces. Furthermore, Taiwanese Foreign
Minister Joseph Wu says that China will inevitably
have to monitor the war between Russia and Ukraine
closely and that China may reevaluate its ability to
invade Taiwan and the reaction from the international
community amid the situation. It is necessary to continue
to monitor the related situations closely with a focus


on the fact that Taiwan views the effect of the Russia s
aggression against Ukraine on China–Taiwan relations
from a calm and multi-faceted perspective, including a
medium-to-long-term point of view.

See Chapter 3, Section 3-3 (Military Capabilities of Taiwan and

Military Balance between China and Taiwan))

North Korea voted against the UN General Assembly’s
resolution demanding the immediate withdrawal of
Russian troops from Ukraine and claims that the United
States and other Western countries are to blame for the
conflict in Ukraine. North Korea, showing its stance of
defending Russia, makes claims consistent with its own
stance of blaming the United States, with which it is in
rivalry in the long term.

Chapter 3, Section 4-1-5 (Relations with States and Regions)


India, which has traditionally deep relations with Russia
in a “Special and Privileged Strategic Partnership,”
avoids explicit criticism of Russia regarding its invasion
of Ukraine, emphasizing the immediate cessation
of hostilities and violence and a resolution through
dialogue and diplomacy. After the Russian invasion of
Ukraine, while Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi
had spoken on telephone with both President Putin and
President Zelenskyy, as well as the United States and
the Quad leaders; Japan, the United States and Australia,
India avoids a direct mention of Russia in any of its
joint statements and maintains its own stance against
the backdrop of a military cooperation with Russia.
Russia’s share in Indian arms imports on an amount
basis in the past five years is approximately 50%, and
in April 2022 the delivery of the second regiment of
Russian-made S-400 surface-to-air missile, which had
contracted for purchase, was reported. India maintains
its strong cooperation with Russia in terms of military
equipment and it is necessary to pay attention to the
response of India, including the effect of the Russian
invasion of Ukraine.

the Chinese government’s oppression of the Uyghur
people as “genocide,” and did not send government
representatives to the Olympic Winter Games in Beijing,
citing human rights violations in the Xinjiang Uyghur
Autonomous Region.
In regard to relations with Taiwan as it relates to
China, the United States has not changed its “One China”
policy. On top of this, it has positioned Taiwan as both
a major democratic partner and a major economic and
security partner, and has shown a willingness to promote

start of Russia’s aggression against Ukraine in February
2022. In addition, the aforementioned Global Posture
Review clearly states that it strengthens the U.S. combatcredible deterrent against Russian aggression and
enables NATO forces to operate more effectively. The
Biden administration also rescinded the 25,000 activeduty force cap in Germany and the Army Multi-Domain
Task Force[2] and other personnel in Germany would be
permanently stationed. It is important to pay attention
to the future developments of the U.S. force’s posture in
response to the situation in Ukraine.
In regard to the Middle East, the U.S. military withdrew
from Afghanistan at the end of August 2021, ending the 20year U.S. military presence in the region. President Biden,
in his statement on the conclusion of the war in Afghanistan
that was the longest war in U.S. history, expressed his view
that it was not in the U.S. national interest to continue
deploying the U.S. forces in Afghanistan and the United
States must focus on strengthening its competitiveness
to meet new 21st century challenges such as serious
competition with China. The end of the combat mission
of the U.S. forces in Iraq was also announced in December
2021. The U.S. forces that continue to be stationed in
Iraq have the missions to provide advice, support, and
training to the Iraqi military forces. In addition, regarding
the nuclear agreement with Iran, from which the former
Trump administration declared its withdrawal in May
2018, the Biden administration has stated its position that it
would return to the agreement as a starting point for further
negotiations if Iran would return to strict compliance with
the nuclear agreement. The administration has continued
talks with Iran since April 2021 toward rebuilding the
nuclear agreement, but concrete progress has not been
seen.
The Biden administration has indicated that its foreign
policy direction will be based on international cooperation
and that its responses will be made in close collaboration
with allies and partners. As concrete moves for this, in
September 2021, the leaders of Japan, the United States,
Australia, and India held the first in-person summit
meeting as the “Quad.” The leaders affirmed that their
countries, as democratic partners with a common vision,
would unite to address major contemporary challenges

While the Biden administration has positioned
relations with China as strategic competition, the
administration has shown its intention to pursue
cooperation with China in areas with shared interests
such as climate change and arms control, and become
involved in issues with China by working with its allies
and partners.
In regard to relations with North Korea, the
administration announced the completion of a review
of its policy toward North Korea in April 2021, and has
indicated that it intends to advance diplomacy with North
Korea through a “calibrated, practical approach” with
the goal of “complete denuclearization of the Korean
Peninsula.” The administration has also made clear its
intention to advance its consideration in consultation with
allies and partners, such as the ROK and Japan, at every
step of the response to North Korea.
Concerning Europe, with regard to relations with
Russia, the United States and Russia agreed to start new
Strategic Stability Dialogues at the first U.S.-Russia
summit meeting held under the Biden administration
in June 2021. Since then, multiple dialogues have been
held. On the other hand, while the U.S. and Russia had
been coordinating an easing of tensions between the two
countries surrounding the situation in Ukraine including
U.S.-Russia summit meetings (video teleconference,

2021 by the China Task Force established within the DoD,
the DoD has begun department-wide efforts to improve
its capabilities, including revitalizing its networks with
allies and partners, in order to better respond to the
security challenges posed by China, the greatest issue
facing the United States. The current administration, in
the Interim Guidance, positions Iran and North Korea
as regional actors and evaluates that these countries
“continue to pursue game-changing technologies, while
threatening U.S. allies and partners and challenging
regional stability.” In addition, the Biden administration
also shows a view that the United States “faces
challenges within countries whose governance is fragile,
and from influential non-state actors that have the ability
to disrupt American interests” and terrorism and violent
extremism remain significant threats. In consideration
of these recognitions, the United States, in line with
the Trump administration, positions threats posed by
China and Russia-with particular emphasis on China-as
priority issues to be addressed and appears to implement
a policy of dealing with threats posed by North Korea,
Iran, and radical terrorist groups, as well as production,
proliferation, and use of weapons of mass destruction.
Furthermore, the Biden administration expresses high
interest in the impact of climate change on security issues.
In October 2021, Secretary of Defense Austin announced
the Department of Defense Climate Adaptation Plan,
which will serve as a guide for maintaining the readiness
and resilience of the U.S. military in the future under
increasingly severe environmental conditions. The Plan
calls for addressing climate change challenges not only
through DoD efforts but also across the entire federal
government as well as with allies and partners.

In March 2021, the Biden administration published
the Interim Guidance to indicate the direction taken by
the United States while the formulation of the national
security strategy is still in progress. This Guidance
states the necessity to renew the United States’ enduring
advantages in order to meet today’s challenges from a
position of strength, and that begins with the revitalization
of democracy, which is the most fundamental advantage
of the United States. More specifically, the Guidance

security, and defense cooperation in the Indo-Pacific
region. AUKUS will deepen cooperation on various
security and defense capabilities such as cyber and
artificial intelligence. As the first initiative under
AUKUS, the three countries agreed to cooperate for the
acquisition of nuclear powered submarines by Australia.[3]
In April 2022, the countries announced that they will also
deepen cooperation on hypersonic capabilities, electronic
warfare capabilities, information sharing and innovation.
On the domestic political front in the United States,
attention will be focused on how the midterm elections
in November 2022 will affect U.S. security and defense
policy.

**1 Perception about Security Environment**

The Biden administration indicates in the Interim
Guidance that “we must contend with the reality that
the distribution of power across the world is changing
and creating new threats.” The Guidance shows a view
that China and Russia have put considerable energy into
weakening American power and obstructing the U.S.
efforts to protect its interests and allies, with China in
particular rapidly increasing its external assertions. In this
regard, based on the recommendations submitted in June


Although Australia had planned to procure 12 conventional submarines (attack-class submarines) from France, this plan was canceled because it was decided to acquire nuclear-powered

shows the future direction of the country s efforts in
the form of: defending and nurturing the underlying
sources of American strength including democracy,
economy, national defense and so on; promoting a
favorable distribution of power to deter and prevent
adversaries; and leading and sustaining a stable and open
international system. The administration also expresses in
the Guidance that the United States is unable to achieve
these objectives alone. For that reason, the United States
will reinvigorate its alliances and partnerships around the
world, while also showing its intention to work with allies
to share responsibilities equitably and encourage them to
invest in their own comparative advantages. In terms of
the military aspect, the Biden administration ensures that
the U.S. Forces will receive the best training in the world
and continue to be a fully equipped armed forces, while
shifting its “emphasis from unneeded legacy platforms
and weapons systems to free up resources for investments
in the cutting-edge technologies and capabilities.” In
addition, the Guidance states the plan that the United
States will prioritize defense investment in climate
resiliency and clean energy.
While the Biden administration has been conducting
a general review of its national security policy since
announcing the Interim Guidance, the DoD released the
fact sheet of the National Defense Strategy[4] in March
2022. In the fact sheet, the DoD positioned China as
the most consequential strategic competitor and the
pacing challenge for the DoD, and expressed that it will
prioritize responding to China’s challenge to sustain and
strengthen deterrence, then Russia’s challenge which
poses acute threat. The fact sheet also states that its
alliances and partnerships are an enduring strength for
the United States and the DoD will incorporate ally and
partner perspectives, competencies, and advantages at
every stage of defense planning. Furthermore, the DoD
will advance its goals through three primary ways: (1)
Integrated deterrence that maximizes U.S. national power
by working seamlessly across warfighting domains,
theaters, and network of alliances and partnerships; (2)
Campaigning that strengthens deterrence and enables
the United States to gain advantages against the full
range of competitors’ coercive actions; and (3) Building
enduring advantages through reforms to accelerate force
development and getting the required technology quickly.

**3 Engagement in the Indo-Pacific Region**

The FY2022 budget request released in May 2021
included $5.1 billion for the Pacific Deterrence Initiative
(PDI), which aims to bolster deterrence and maintain
a competitive advantage with China as the number
one pacing challenge. The FY2022 National Defense
Authorization Act passed in December 2021 increased the
budget for the PDI to $7.1 billion. The PDI includes the
establishment of the “Guam Defense System” that will
provide an integrated air and missile defense capability
with 360-degree coverage to protect Guam from various
missile threats, including hypersonic missiles. The
specific details of the system will be the focus of attention
going forward.
In February 2022, the Biden administration released
the “Indo-Pacific Strategy” for the first regional strategy
in the administration. This clearly indicated that the
administration will continue to place the highest
priority on the Indo-Pacific region as did the previous
administration. The Indo-Pacific Strategy recognizes
that the Indo-Pacific region faces increasing challenges,
particularly from China, and makes clear that the United
States will cooperate with allies and partners for efforts
to advance a Free and Open Indo-Pacific and strengthen
regional security. To implement the strategy, the “IndoPacific Action Plan” was also released, indicating the
initiatives to be implemented over the next two years. The
future progress of specific initiatives will gain attention.
In July 2020, regarding China’s maritime expansion,
after the U.S. DoD expressed concern about China’s
decision to conduct military exercises in the South China

Sea, the United States deployed two Carrier Strike Groups
in the South China Sea for the first time in about six years
and conducted naval exercises. The Biden administration
announced that the United States had deployed two Carrier
Strike Groups in the South China Sea in February 2021
and also that U.S. carrier strike groups and amphibious
ready groups had conducted integrated exercises in the
same area in April 2021.The current administration
expressed its intention to continue showing its allies and
others in the region the efforts by the United States to
promote a “Free and Open Indo-Pacific.” In July 2021,
during his visit to Southeast Asia, Secretary of Defense
Austin stated that China’s claim to the vast majority of
the South China Sea has no basis in international law and
that the United States would support coastal states in the
region to uphold their rights under international law. In
August 2021, in her speech in Singapore, Vice President
Harris pointed out that China continued to coerce,
intimidate, and make unlawful claims for territorial
rights in the South China Sea, and that China’s actions
undermine the rules-based order and continue to threaten
the sovereignty of countries in the region. In addition,
in January 2022, the State Department released a study
examining China’s claims regarding its maritime rights
in the South China Sea in light of international law. The
study noted that China’s claims over most of the South
China Sea are inconsistent with international law and
gravely undermine the rule of law in the ocean.
As part of its activities around strengthening its presence
in the Indo-Pacific region, the U.S. Navy which promotes
Distributed Maritime Operations (DMO)[5] deployed the
USS America, an amphibious assault ship with enhanced
ability to carry F-35B fighters and other carrier-based
planes, to Sasebo in December 2019 to replace the
amphibious assault ship USS Wasp. In addition, the
amphibious transport dock USS New Orleans was also
deployed to Sasebo that month. In Guam, the MQ-4C
Triton maritime surveillance unmanned aircraft system
underwent its first deployment in January 2020. The U.S.
Air Force which promotes Agile Combat Employment
(ACE)[6] conducts ACE exercises in the Indo-Pacific region
using fighter aircraft and unmanned aircraft. Furthermore,
the U.S. Army which promotes a multi-domain operational
concept plans to deploy a Multi-Domain Task Force in
the region to undertake operations simultaneously in all


domains, including the aspect of human cognition. The
Marine Corps which promote the Expeditionary Advanced
Base Operations (EABO)[7] has announced its intention to
establish the Marine Littoral Regiment, which will focus
on the sea control and sea denial missions, and deploy it
in the region. In March 2018, the aircraft carrier USS Carl
Vinson made the first port call by a U.S. aircraft carrier in
over 40 years in Vietnam. Another port call in the country
was made in March 2020, by the aircraft carrier USS
Theodore Roosevelt.
The Biden administration announced that President
Biden had asserted the maintenance of the vision of a
“Free and Open Indo-Pacific” as a priority matter in the
U.S.-China summit telephone talk in February 2021 to
clarify the U.S. position to pursue the vision would remain
unchanged. In addition, in regard to relations with the
Philippines, President Duterte in July 2021 determined to
recall the letter of the termination of the Visiting Forces
Agreement, which stipulates the treatment of U.S. forces
visiting the Philippines. Moreover, during the U.S.Philippines defense ministers’ meeting in September
2021, Secretary of Defense Austin declared that the
United States’ commitments under the U.S.-Philippines
Mutual Defense Treaty extend to the Philippine armed
forces, public vessels, and aircraft in the South China
Sea. In this context, cooperative relations between the
United States and the Philippines in the region have
been strengthened. With this stance, since February
2021, the Biden administration has continued to conduct
“Freedom of Navigation Operations” in the South China
Sea, and U.S. Navy vessels have passed through the
Taiwan Strait multiple times in order to show the U.S.
commitment to a “Free and Open Indo-Pacific.” At this
announcement, the United States clearly indicated that
it bears a number of responsibilities in the Indo-Pacific
region, with the protection of the rights and freedom of
navigation in accordance with international law being
one of the responsibilities, and therefore, the country
would continue the Freedom of Navigation Operation.
Based on the posture towards the Indo-Pacific
described above, the United States appears to continue to
be undertaking initiatives based on its vision of a “Free
and Open Indo-Pacific.”
In contrast, while talks between the United States and
North Korea have been conducted since their first summit

meeting in history held in June 2018, no specific progress
has been seen with regard to the dismantlement of North
Korea’s missiles and weapons of mass destruction.
Responding to that summit meeting, the U.S. DoD
suspended the U.S.-ROK command and control exercise
Ulchi-Freedom Guardian and the scheduled Vigilant
Ace U.S.-ROK bilateral annual flying exercise, and then
decided to conclude the Key Resolve and Foal Eagle
series of exercises usually held by the United States and
the ROK every spring. Then Acting Secretary of Defense
Patrick Shanahan expressed a willingness to maintain
U.S. Forces in the ROK, stating that close coordination
between the military activities of the United States and
the ROK will continue to support diplomatic efforts
and that the two countries were committed to ensuring
the continued combined defense posture of U.S.-ROK
combined forces and maintaining firm military readiness.
Amid this situation, since May 2019, North Korea
has repeatedly conducted ballistic missile launches and
announced in December 2019 that it would continue to
develop strategic weapons until the United States rolls
back its hostile policy.
In January 2021, according to North Korea’s
announcement, Chairman Kim Jong-un called the United
States North Korea’s “biggest enemy” and expressed his
view that whoever would be in power in the United States,
the U.S. policy on North Korea would not change, while
also remarking that the key to establishing a new U.S.North Korea relationship would be the withdrawal of
the hostile policy by the United States. Furthermore, at a
meeting of the Politburo of the Workers’ Party of Korea in
January 2022, it was assessed that the “hostile policy and
military threat by the U.S. have reached a danger line that
cannot be overlooked anymore,” and it was announced
that North Korea would “promptly examine the issue of
restarting all temporarily suspended activities.”
The Biden Administration sees that North Korea
continues with its nuclear and missile plans, positions
it as an urgent priority issue to the United States,
and clarifies its policy of continuing to work on the
denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula. At the JapanU.S. Security Consultative Committee (Japan-U.S.
“2+2”) held in January 2022, the two countries reaffirmed
their commitment to the complete denuclearization of
the Korean Peninsula and expressed strong concern
about the progress of North Korea’s nuclear and missile
development. At the present point, concrete progress
on the disarmament of North Korea’s weapons of mass


destruction and missiles has not been seen. However,
attention will be paid to how the United States advances
its policy toward North Korea.
In addition, it has been pointed out that U.S.
involvement in the Indo-Pacific region may be impacted
as a result of having to focus efforts on the European front
in response to the Russia’s aggression against Ukraine.
However, the U.S. military’s “Global Posture Review”
released in November 2021 positions the Indo-Pacific as
a priority region, and on top of this, the fact sheet of the
NDS released in March 2022 also states that the challenge
posed by China in the Indo-Pacific region is a top priority.
As such, it remains to be seen how U.S. involvement in
the Indo-Pacific region will shift moving forward.

Section 4-1-5 (1) (Relations with the United States)


**4 Innovation in the National Defense**
**Field**

In President Biden’s remarks at the DoD in February 2021,
the Biden administration, emphasizing the importance of
technologies in national defense strategies, stated that the
United States would deal with dangers and opportunities
generated through emerging technologies, enhance
its capabilities in cyberspace, and lead in a new era of
competition from deep sea to outer space. With regard
to strategic competition with China, President Biden
has indicated the view that technological competition
including innovation would become one of the central
issues. In the FY2023 budget request released in March
2022, the DoD prioritized investment in cyber and
innovation including artificial intelligence, for which the
largest ever $130.1 billion RDT&E budget for innovation
and modernization has been requested. As such, attention
should be paid to further efforts in this area.

**5 Nuclear and Missile Defense Policy**

The Nuclear Posture Review (NPR) released by the Trump
administration in February 2018 stated that, although the
United States had reduced the role and number of nuclear
weapons based on the aspiration that if the United States
took the lead in reducing nuclear arms, other states
would follow, the global threat conditions have worsened
markedly since the previous NPR released in 2010 and
there now exist unprecedented threats and uncertainty,
as China and Russia have expanded their nuclear forces
and North Korea continues its pursuit of nuclear weapons

and missile capabilities. Given these circumstances, the
following were raised as the roles of U.S. nuclear forces:
(1) Deterrence of nuclear and nonnuclear attacks; (2)
Assurance of allies and partners; (3) Achievement of U.S.
objectives if deterrence fails; and (4) Capacity to hedge
against an uncertain future.
Also, while the United States would only consider
the employment of nuclear weapons in extreme
circumstances to defend the vital interests of the United
States, its allies, and partners, the NPR clearly states
that extreme circumstances could include significant
non-nuclear strategic attacks against the United States
and its allies, and a “no first use” policy is not justified
today. It also indicates that the United States maintains a
policy of retaining some ambiguity regarding the precise
circumstances that might lead to a U.S. nuclear response.
Furthermore, it also revealed that the United States would
apply a tailored approach to deterrence across a spectrum
of adversaries, threats and contexts, and in addition, would
ensure effective deterrence by enhancing the flexibility
and range of its nuclear capabilities through nuclear
modernization and the development and deployment of
new capabilities. Specifically, in addition to sustaining
and replacing the nuclear triad,[8] as new capabilities, in
the near-term, the United States would modify a small
number of existing submarine-launched ballistic missiles
(SLBM) warheads to provide a low-yield option, and
incorporate nuclear capability onto F-35A fighters as a
replacement for the current aging dual-capable aircraft
(DCA).
On August 2, 2019, the Trump administration
withdrew from the Intermediate-Range Nuclear Forces
(INF) Treaty with Russia as the administration alleged
that Russia violated the treaty. In the same month, the
United States conducted a flight test of a conventionallyconfigured ground-launched missile with a range of
more than 500 km. In this regard, the United States has
been working on the development of intermediate-range,
conventional, and ground-launched missiles whose test
launches, production and possession had been restricted
by the treaty.
In the Interim Guidance, the Biden administration
states that the United States will “take steps to reduce the
role of nuclear weapons in our national security strategy,
while ensuring our strategic deterrents remain safe,


secure, and effective, and that our extended deterrence
commitments to our allies remain strong and credible.”
The administration also mentions its intention to avoid
costly arms races, to pursue the establishment of a new
arms control framework if possible, and to “engage in
meaningful dialogue with Russia and China on a range
of emerging military technological developments that
implicate strategic stability.” In February 2021, the
Biden administration extended the New START Treaty
(Strategic Arms Reduction Treaty) for five years until
February 5, 2026, based on the agreement with Russia.
The extension of the New START Treaty seems to be
based on the administration’s plan indicated in the Interim
Guidance. President Biden stresses that the New START
Treaty extension is only the beginning of U.S. efforts to
address 21st century security challenges, and the country
will pursue further enhancement of the framework for
controlling nuclear weapons, using the time provided
by a five-year extension. First of all, regarding the New
START Treaty to which launchers, deployed missiles,
bombers, and deployed nuclear warheads related to
nuclear triad are subject, the administration indicates
that it will pursue the framework for arms control that
addresses all kinds of nuclear weapons with the Russian
Federation, in consultation with Congress and U.S. allies
and partners. In addition, President Biden indicates
that the United States will also pursue the arms control
framework to reduce risks by China’s modern and
growing nuclear arsenal.
In March 2022, the fact sheet of the “2022 Nuclear
Posture Review” was released, indicating that maintaining
a safe, secure, and effective nuclear deterrent and strong
and credible extended deterrence commitments remain
a top priority for the U.S. It also indicates that the U.S.
will continue to emphasize strategic stability, seek to
avoid costly arms races, and facilitate risk reduction
and arms control arrangements where possible, while
it underscores the U.S. commitment to reducing the
role of nuclear weapons and reestablishing the U.S.
leadership in arms control. Upon completion of the
Review, President Biden articulated his vision for the
U.S. nuclear deterrence strategy, stating that for as long
as nuclear weapons exist, the fundamental role of U.S.
nuclear weapons will be to deter nuclear attacks against
the U.S., its allies and partners, and that the U.S. would

and the northwest Indian Ocean.
The U.S. air forces have roughly 3,500 combat
aircraft across the Air Force, Navy, and Marine Corps.
In addition to carrier-based aircraft deployed at sea, part
of the tactical air force is forward-deployed in Germany,
the United Kingdom, Japan, and the ROK, among others.
In regard to strategic offensive weapons including
nuclear force, the United States proceeded with its
reduction based on a new Strategic Arms Reduction
Treaty that came into force in February 2011. It announced
that its deployed strategic warheads[9] stood at 1,389,
while its deployed delivery platforms stood at 665.[10] The
United States is studying the concept of a Conventional
Prompt Global Strike (CPGS), as an effort contributing
to the nation’s new ability to reduce reliance on nuclear
weapons.
Moreover, in addressing the increasing threats in
cyberspace, in May 2018, the Cyber Command, which
was previously a subunified command under U.S.
Strategic Command, was elevated to a unified combatant
command.
In August 2019, the United States founded the Space
Command to serve as a geographic unified combatant
command and then established the Space Force as the
sixth branch of the military within the Department of the
Air Force that December.


**2 Current Military Posture in the Indo-**
**Pacific Region**

The United States, a Pacific nation, continues to play
an important role in ensuring the peace and stability of
the Indo-Pacific region by deploying the Indo-Pacific
Command, a combatant command integrating the Army,
Navy, Air Force and Marine Corps in the region. The IndoPacific Command is a geographic combatant command
which is responsible for the largest geographical area, and
its subordinate unified commands include U.S. Forces
Japan and U.S. Forces Korea.
The Indo-Pacific Command consists of the U.S.
Army Pacific, U.S. Pacific Fleet, U.S. Marine Corps
Forces Pacific, and U.S. Pacific Air Forces, which are all
headquartered in Hawaii.
The Army Pacific’s subordinate commands include the
25th Infantry Division in Hawaii, the 8th U.S. Army in the
ROK, which is the Army component of the U.S. Forces
in the ROK, and the U.S. Army Alaska. Additionally, the
Army Pacific assigns approximately 2,500 personnel to
commands in Japan, such as I Corps (Forward) and the
Headquarters, U.S. Army Japan Command.[11]

The U.S. Pacific Fleet consists of the 7th Fleet, which
is responsible for the Western Pacific and the Indian
Ocean, and the 3rd Fleet, responsible for the East Pacific
and Bering Sea. The U.S. Pacific Fleet in total controls
about 200 vessels. The 7th Fleet mainly consists of a
carrier strike group with main stationing locations in
Japan and Guam. Their mission is to defend territorial
lands, people, sea lines of communication, and the critical
national interests of the United States and its allies. An
aircraft carrier, amphibious ships, and Aegis cruisers
among others are assigned to the 7th Fleet.
The U.S. Marine Corps Forces Pacific deploys one
Marine Expeditionary Force each in the U.S. mainland
and Japan. Of this force, about 20,000 personnel are in
the 3rd Marine Division, the 1st Marine Aircraft Wing,
which employs F-35B fighters and other aircraft, and
other divisions in Japan. In addition, the force deploys
maritime pre-positioning ships loaded with heavy
equipment and others in the Western Pacific.
The U.S. Pacific Air Force has three air forces, of

capabilities through military modernization including


-----

Cutting-edge technologies that China seeks to develop and
acquire include game changing technologies that would
dramatically change future warfare.
China’s 2019 white paper, “China’s National Defense
in the New Era,” released in July 2019, notes that
“intelligentized warfare is on the horizon,” indicating that
attention should be paid to Chinese forces’ efforts to use
artificial intelligence (AI) technology.
Along with efforts to reinforce its operational
capabilities, China is engaging in attempts to unilaterally
change the status quo by coercion based on its own
assertions incompatible with the existing international
order, and has been expanding and intensifying its military
activities in maritime and aerial domains, notably in the East
China Sea. China, particularly regarding maritime issues
where its interests conflict with others’, continues to act
in an assertive manner, which includes dangerous acts that
could cause unintended contingencies. Moreover, moves
to strengthen China-Russia cooperation, including military
activities, have been further intensifying. Additionally,
China continues to demonstrate its willingness to realize
its unilateral assertions without making any compromises,
steadily moving forward with efforts to change the status
quo by coercion and to create a fait accompli.
The Chinese military leadership has exhibited the
“struggle” against the Senkaku Islands, an inherent
territory of Japan, the establishment of the “East China Sea
Air Defense Identification Zone (ADIZ),”[1] its Navy and Air
Force’s “regular patrols,” and others as the achievements of
the military forces’ activities and emphasized to continue
improving the Chinese military’s operational capabilities.
Furthermore, the Chinese military forces have rapidly
expanded and intensified activities including those in
the areas surrounding Japan, such as the East China Sea,
Pacific Ocean and Sea of Japan. Given these facts, there
is a high probability that China would not only attempt to
make such activities routine but also further expand and
intensify them both qualitatively and quantitatively. These
military trends, combined with insufficient transparency
about China’s defense policy and military affairs, have
become a matter of grave security concern to the region
including Japan and the international community, and such
trends have further intensified in recent years, given the


modernization and diversification of China s nuclear and
missile forces, the “intelligentization” of military forces
through the acquisition of cutting-edge technologies,
and the expansion and intensification of their activities
surrounding Japan and other areas, and as such should be
closely monitored with keen interest in the future.

**2 Defense Policies**

China has described the objectives of its defense policies
and the missions of its military forces as: supporting the
CCP’s leadership, China’s characteristic socialism system,
and the modernization of its socialism, defending the
nation’s sovereignty, unification and security, backing
the nation’s sustainable “peaceful development” through
protecting its maritime and overseas national interests,
building strong national defense and massive military
forces commensurate with the interests of the nation’s
security and the interests of development, and providing
strong assurances for realizing the “Chinese dream” of the
great revival of the Chinese nation. China contends that
these national defense policies are “defensive” in nature.[2]

For the development of national defense and military
forces, China has employed a policy of building the “system
of modern military power with Chinese characteristics”
by sustaining the military development under the party,
the military buildup through reforms, military promotion
based on science and technology, and law-based military
governance, by pursuing practical capabilities that
“can fight and win a war” by giving greater priority to
the civil-military fusion, by promoting the fusion and
development of mechanization and informatization, and
by accelerating the intelligentization of military forces.
This might have apparently deepened a policy of giving
priority to the informatization of military forces based
on a military strategy to win informatized local wars
in response to the global trend of military development.
Such military buildup in China apparently indicates that
China has given top priority to dealing with a Taiwan
contingency by improving its capabilities to deter or deny
Taiwan’s independence and foreign military support for the
Taiwanese independence, and has recently considered the
improvement of operational capabilities in more distant


On November 23, 2013, China established the “East China Sea ADIZ” including the Senkaku Islands misleadingly indicated as if they were China’s territory. China requires aircraft flying in the zone
to abide by rules set by its Ministry of National Defense and claims to take military “defensive emergency measures” against aircraft failing to do so, unduly infringing on the principle of freedom
of overflight. Over the move to unilaterally change the status quo in the East China Sea, not only Japan but also the United States, the ROK, Australia, and the European Union (EU) expressed
concerns.

waters to protect its expanding overseas interests.
Furthermore, China seems to emphasize not only
physical means but also non-physical means in military
affairs and warfare. It regards the concept of “Three
Warfares” - “Media Warfare,” “Psychological Warfare,”
and “Legal Warfare” - as part of the political work of
the military. In addition, China has set forth a policy of
coordinating military struggle closely with political,
diplomatic, economic, cultural, and legal endeavors.
As for the future goals of the development of national
defense and military forces, General Secretary Xi Jinping’s
report to the 19th CCP National Congress in October 2017
and the defense white paper released in 2019 noted that
China would try to (1) basically achieve mechanization
and make great progress in informatization to dramatically
improve strategic capabilities by 2020, (2) basically
complete the modernization of national defense and military
forces by 2035, and (3) generally transform Chinese forces
into world-class forces by the mid-21st century. These
goals reportedly indicate that the third stage of the “Three
Stage Development Strategy” for the basic modernization
of national defense and military forces by the middle of
the 21st century would be achieved 15 years ahead of
schedule. The goals thus might have been based on fasterthan-expected progress in the military modernization for
China itself. In addition, during the 5th Plenary Session of
the 19th Central Committee of the CCP in October 2020,
China expressed its determination to achieve a struggle
goal for the 100th anniversary of the foundation of the PLA
in 2027. The same was reemphasized at the 6th Plenary
Session in 2021. This goal could have been newly set as
an interim goal up to the second stage with the deadline for
achievement in 2035, following the near achievement of
the goal of the first stage described above.
However, China has recognized a wide gap between the
real military modernization level and the level required for
national security, and between Chinese and world-class
military forces. Although China has not defined what it
means by “world-class forces,” it has been pointed out that
China may seek to develop a military that is equal to - or in
some cases superior to - the U.S. military. Furthermore, it has
also been pointed out that China aims to build “world-class
forces” capable of “intelligentized warfare” by acquiring


advanced technology and becoming an innovation
superpower.”[3] In light of this, it is suggested that China
is planning to offset its military power gap with the U.S.
military, and may recognize that the “intelligentization”
of its forces is a necessary condition for this. It is thought
that China will aim to build a military that “can fight and
win a war” against the U.S. military in the “intelligentized
warfare” in the future.[4]

Based on that recognition, it is expected that China
will further accelerate the military modernization against
the backdrop of national power development and General
Secretary Xi’s enhancement of his power base in the CCP
and expansion of his power as Chairman of the Central
Military Commission[5].

**3 Transparency Concerning Defense**
**Policies and Military Affairs**

China has neither set out a clear and specific future
vision of its military strengthening, nor ensured adequate
transparency of its decision-making process in relation to
military and security affairs. China has released a defense
white paper almost every two years since 1998. Most
recently, it released a defense white paper in July 2019 for
the first time in approximately four years. The latest one
was titled “China’s National Defense in the New Era.”
In those publications as well, China has not fully
disclosed information such as specific weapons in
possession, procurement goals and results, organization
and locations of major units, records of main military
operations and exercises, and a detailed breakdown of its
national defense budget.
Incidents in which Chinese authorities provide factually
inaccurate explanations or refuse to admit facts regarding
Chinese military activities have been confirmed, inciting
concerns over China’s military decision-making and
actions. For example, the submerged transit of a Chinese
Navy submarine through Japan’s contiguous zone around
the Senkaku Islands was confirmed in January 2018, but
China did not acknowledge this. Similarly, in the cases
of submarines presumed to belong to China that were
confirmed in the contiguous zone around Amami Oshima
Island in June 2020 and September 2021, China did not


According to the annual report “Military and Security Developments Involving the People’s Republic of China,” U.S. DoD (2021).

There is a view that “intelligentization” of the military provides an excellent opportunity for a latecomer’s military to leap ahead in development and thereby rapidly surpass other advanced-level
militaries.

The Central Military Commission is a leading and commanding organ to China’s armed forces. Formally, there are the CCP CMC and the People’s Republic of China CMC. However, each consists

acknowledge them. On the contrary, there were some
Chinese media reports that criticized the Japanese side by
claiming Japan was making exaggerations.
Similarly, explanations that stoke concerns about
Chinese military decision-making and actions are also
evident in comments about the South China Sea, where
China is seeking to unilaterally change the status quo and to
create a fait accompli, including through militarization. At
the press conference after the U.S.-China summit meeting
in September 2015, President Xi Jinping stated “China
does not have any intention to pursue militarization” in
the South China Sea, but in February the following year,
Foreign Minister Wang Yi described the facilities in the
South China Sea as “necessary self-defense facilities” that
China was developing in accordance with international law.
In 2017, reports in official media asserted that China had
rationally expanded the area of its “islands and reefs” in
the South China Sea to “strengthen the necessary military
defense.”
China’s influence in the international community
has risen politically, economically, and militarily. It has
become increasingly important for China to improve
its transparency regarding defense policies and military
affairs, provide fact-based explanations about its activities,
and share and observe international rules as a responsible
country in the international community to allay concerns
about China. It is strongly hoped that China will increase
transparency through such efforts as specific and accurate
information disclosure.

**4 National Defense Budget**

China announced that its national defense budget for
FY2022 was approximately 1,450.45 billion yuan
(approximately 24,657.7 billion Japanese yen when the
value is mechanically converted at 17 yen per yuan).[6] This
initial budget amount represented a growth of approximately
7.1% (approximately 95.1 billion yuan) compared to the
initial budget amount for the previous fiscal year. China’s
announced national defense budget recorded a doubledigit increase almost every year between FY1989 and
FY2015. The nominal size of China’s announced national
defense budget grew approximately 39-fold in the 30 years
from FY1992 and approximately 2.2-fold in the 10 years


from FY2012. China positions the buildup of defense
capabilities as important a task as economic development.
It is believed that China has continued to invest resources
in the improvement of its defense capabilities in tandem
with its economic development. However, there have been
many years in which the announced annual national defense
budget increase rate exceeded the economic growth (an
increase in gross domestic product). Attention is to be paid
to how the slowdown in China’s economic growth would
affect its national defense budget.
In addition, it is noted that the amount of the announced
defense budget is considered to be only a part of its actual
military expenditures. For example, it is believed that
the announced defense budget does not include foreign
equipment procurement costs or research and development
(R&D) expenses. According to an analysis of the U.S.
DoD, actual defense spending in FY2021 was 1.1 to two
times higher than stated in its official budget.[7]

As for a breakdown of the national defense budget, past
defense white papers specified personnel, training and
sustainment, and equipment expenses for the announced
national defense budgets for FY2007, FY2009 and
FY2010-2017 (and expenses for active, reserve and militia
forces for FY2007 and FY2009). However, no more details
have been given.


See


Fig. I-3-2-1 (Changes in China’s Announced Defense Budget)


**5 Military Posture**

China’s armed forces are composed of the PLA, the
People’s Armed Police Force (PAP), and the militia. It is
provided that these bodies be instructed and commanded
by the Central Military Commission (CMC). The PLA is
defined as a people’s force created and led by the CCP,
comprising the Army, the Navy, the Air Force, the Rocket
Force, the Strategic Support Force, the Joint Logistics
Support Force, etc.
The PAP is designed to engage mainly in patrol,
emergency response, counterterrorism, maritime rights
protection and law enforcement, emergency rescue,
defense operations, etc. The militia is planned to engage
in economic construction, etc., in peacetime and undertake
logistic support missions in an emergency.


China’s announced defense budget exceeded Japan’s defense-related expenditures in Chinese FY2007 and reached approximately 4.8 times as much as in Chinese FY2020 (automatically
converted based on exchange rates of respective fiscal years). Japan’s defense-related expenditures have remained almost unchanged for around 20 years (approximately 1.1 times in 30 years).
It has also been pointed out that in comparing defense expenditures between the two countries, China has exceeded Japan in terms of purchasing power parity since 2001.

Note: This basically shows the defense budget within “the central government’s general public budget,” which had been named as “the central fiscal expenditures” prior to FY2014.
Year-on-year growth rate compares the budget of a given year against the initial budget of the previous year. Note that FY2002 defense budget was calculated based on the
increased amount from the defense budget in the previous FY because only the amount and rate of growth were released. For FY2016 and FY2018-2022, the amounts of “the
central government expenditures,” which are part of the central government’s general public budget, are used because they were the only announced amounts. Figures for
year-on-year growth rate include figures announced by China.


**(1) Military Reforms**
In recent years, China has been carrying out military
reforms seen as the largest in its history. In November
2015, Chairman Xi unveiled China’s official position on a
specific direction of the military reforms for the first time,
announcing that the military reforms would be carried out
by 2020.
By the end of 2016, the so-called “above-the-neck”
reforms in the center of the military were reported to have
basically been completed. Specifically, they abolished
the PLA’s seven Military Regions and created five new
Theaters with primary responsibility for command of
operations, namely, the Eastern Theater, Southern Theater,
Western Theater, Northern Theater, and Central Theater.
In addition, they also formed the PLA Army (PLAA)
Headquarters-ranked equally with the PLA Navy (PLAN)
and PLA Air Force (PLAAF) Headquarters-, the Rocket
Force (PLARF), the Strategic Support Force (PLASSF),
and the Joint Logistics Support Force. Moreover, the
headquarters for the entire PLA were replaced by 15
functional sections under the CMC, including the Joint Staff
Department, Political Work Department, Logistics Support
Department, and Equipment Development Department.
Since 2017, military reforms have been making steady
progress with the start of what are called full-scale “belowthe-neck” military reforms at the field level. For example,
the expansion of the Navy Marine Corps whose missions


include amphibious landing operations, has been confirmed
along with the unification of PAP leadership and command
system under the CMC, and the reorganization of 18 Group
Armies into 13, a reduction of 300,000 soldiers, the transfer
of the coast guard to the PAP, etc.
It is considered that these series of reforms are designed
to build more practical military forces by improving
their joint operational capabilities and strengthening the
military’s readiness, including the development of military
capabilities and organizational management in peacetime.
In addition, it has been noted that the reorganization of
the headquarters is a means of tackling corruption at the
center of the military by decentralizing the leading organs.
Since the 19th CCP National Congress in October 2017,
many members seen as connected deeply to Chairman Xi
have been appointed to the CMC. It has been noted that
many officers trusted deeply by Chairman Xi have been
promoted to senior positions and the rank of general. Given
these points, it is thought that Chairman Xi is attempting to
further enhance his leadership in the CMC and the military.
There are views that dissatisfaction is growing within
the military and among veterans because of the rapid
reforms. Given that China had promoted military reforms
until 2020, the newly revised “National Defense Law of
the People’s Republic of China” (revised National Defense
Law) was adopted at the 24th Session of the 13th Standing
Committee of the China’s National People’s Congress in

(Strategic Arms Reduction Treaty), with the upper limit
of strategic nuclear forces determined between the United
States and Russia, but China has consistently been denying
its participation.
China is viewed as having given priority to conventional
missile capabilities since the 1990s because of the growing
significance of precision-strike capabilities in the global
military trend. In addition, China is aiming to modernize,
diversify, and expand its nuclear capabilities. It is also
investing in and increasing the number of means to deliver
nuclear weapons by land, sea, and air. It has been pointed
out that China plans to secure up to 700 deliverable nuclear
warheads by 2027 and at least 1,000 warheads by 2030.[9] It
is believed that China will continue to place importance on
nuclear and missile capabilities in the future.
China possesses ballistic missiles of various types and
ranges, including ICBMs, SLBMs, intermediate-range
ballistic missiles (IRBMs)/medium-range ballistic missiles
(MRBMs), and short-range ballistic missiles (SRBMs).
The update of China’s ballistic missile forces from a liquid
propellant system to a solid propellant system is improving
their survivability and readiness. Moreover, it is believed
that China is working to increase their performance by
such means as extending ranges, improving targeting
accuracy, and employing maneuverable reentry vehicles
(MaRVs) and multiple independently targetable reentry
vehicles (MIRVs).
China’s main ICBMs, its strategic nuclear asset, had
been the fixed-site liquid-propellant DF-5 missiles.
However, China has in recent years deployed the DF31, which is a mobile-type ICBM with a solid propellant
system mounted onto a transporter erector launcher (TEL).
China is developing the new DF-41 ICBM, which is viewed

December 2020. In this law, protecting China’s overseas
interests, penetration of “Xi Jinping’s thoughts on
strengthening the military,” and space, electromagnetic
spectrum, and cyberspace as critical security areas, etc.,
were newly stipulated. It was assumed that China was
aiming to create an impression that it had achieved major
policy and system reforms by enacting the revised National
Defense Law in 2020. Attention will focus on the outcome
of these military reforms.

**(2) Nuclear and Missile Forces**
China has continued independent efforts to develop nuclear
weapons and missiles for their delivery since the mid1950s, indicating its apparent attempt to ensure nuclear
deterrence, supplement its conventional forces with nuclear
capabilities and secure its influence on the international
community. It is regarded that China’s nuclear strategy is
to deter any nuclear attack on its territory by maintaining a
nuclear force structure able to conduct retaliatory nuclear
attacks on a limited number of targets such as cities in
adversary countries, should China be subject to nuclear
attacks. China has explained that it is committed to “no
first use” of nuclear weapons under any circumstances, to
“unconditional negative security assurance” that it would
not use or threaten to use nuclear weapons against nonnuclear-weapon states or nuclear-weapon-free zones
unconditionally, and to keeping its nuclear capabilities
at the minimum level required for national security.[8] In
recent years, however, doubts have been expressed about
the explanation. Furthermore, the United States has been
inviting China to participate in the New START Treaty

to be able to fly up to approximately 11,200 km and carry
10 warheads. It made its first appearance in the military
parade to mark the 70th anniversary of the founding of the
People’s Republic of China in October 2019.
With regard to submarine-launched ballistic missiles
(SLBM), it is considered that Jin-class Nuclear-Powered
Ballistic Missile Submarines (SSBN) equipped with JL-2
SLBMs with an estimated range of approximately 8,000
km are operational. It is believed that China’s strategic
nuclear capabilities will improve significantly through
nuclear deterrence patrols using the Jin-class SSBNs.
Furthermore, it seems that China is also developing the
JL-3 SLBM with the extended range of 12,000 to 14,000
km and a new SSBN for carrying the JL-3.
China’s missile forces have been put outside the
framework of the U.S.-Russia INF Treaty, and China
holds numerous amounts of ground-launched missiles
with ranges between 500 and 5,500 km that had been
subjected to the INF treaty. It is also deemed that China is
ahead of the United States in relation to ground-launched
ballistic missiles and cruise missiles.[10] As for the IRBMs/
MRBMs covering the Indo-Pacific region including
Japan, China has the mobile solid-propellant DF-21 and
DF-26, which can be transported and operated on TELs.
These are viewed as capable of carrying both conventional
and nuclear warheads. China possesses ballistic missiles
carrying conventional warheads with high targeting
accuracy based on the DF-21, including the DF-21D antiship ballistic missile (ASBM), called “carrier killer,” which
carries conventional warheads to attack overwater ships
including aircraft carriers. The DF-26, which has a range
including Guam and is called “Guam killer,” is considered
a “second-generation ASBM” developed on the basis of
the DF-21D. It was announced in April 2018 that the DF21D had “formally joined the order of battle.” China also
possesses the CJ-20 (CJ-10) long-range land-attack cruise
missile with a range of at least 1,500 km, as well as the H-6
bomber that is capable of carrying this cruise missile. It
is deemed that these missiles complement ballistic missile
forces, covering the Indo-Pacific region including Japan.
In the military parade to celebrate the 70th anniversary of
its founding in October 2019, CJ-100/DF-100, which is
said to be a supersonic cruise missile, also made its first
public appearance. The deployment of these ASBMs and
cruise missiles is expected to strengthen China’s “A2/AD”


capabilities. Concerning SRBMs, China has deployed a
large number of solid-propellant DF-16, DF-15, and DF11 missiles facing Taiwan. It is believed that their ranges
cover a part of Japan’s Southwestern Islands including the
Senkaku Islands.
Furthermore, China is believed to be rapidly developing
several HGVs that would be launched with ballistic
missiles to penetrate missile defenses. Their flight tests
have reportedly been conducted since 2014. In the military
parade to mark the 70th anniversary of China’s founding
in October 2019, the DF-17 MRBM viewed as capable of
carrying a hypersonic glide vehicle made its first public
appearance. The U.S. DoD has pointed out that China put
DF-17s operational in 2020.[11] In August 2018, China is
believed to have tested a hypersonic vehicle featuring the
“waverider” design. Furthermore, related developments are
attracting attention. For example, there were reports that a
test launch of an HGV into low Earth orbit was conducted
around the summer of 2021, and that the “Long March”
rocket used by China in its space program seemed to have
been used for the launch.

out that multiple warheads can be attached to the
aforementioned new ICBM, the DF-41, and that China
is testing an intercontinental range HGV. Furthermore, it
has been pointed out that it is highly likely that the launch
vehicle is derived from the DF-41. It will not only be
capable of significantly extending the effective range of
HGVs compared to the DF-17, but will also be capable of
carrying larger, heavier HGVs. The U.S. DoD estimates
that the number of warheads on the ground-launched
ICBMs capable of threatening the United States is expected
to grow to about 200 in the next five years. The DoD has
also pointed out that China has commenced building at
least three solid-fueled ICBM silo (underground launch
facility) fields, which will cumulatively contain hundreds
of new ICBM silos in the future.[12] This may be planned to
strengthen deterrence against the United States.
These vehicles are said to be more difficult for missiles
to intercept because they fly low at very high speeds and
are highly maneuverable.
China also seems to be making efforts to develop


missile defense technologies, such as the HQ-19 ballistic
missile defense system. It is believed that China has been
conducting missile interceptor tests in the mid-course phase
since 2010. The most recent test was in February 2021.
It has been pointed out that this is an attempt to acquire
capabilities to respond to IRBMs and other missiles.[13] In
addition, in May 2019, two S-400 surface-to-air missile
systems introduced from Russia were reportedly deployed
near Beijing. In October of the same year, Russian
President Putin stated that Russia was helping China build
a “missile-attack early warning system.” Furthermore, the
U.S. DoD has pointed out that China has at least one early
warning satellite in orbit as of 2021.[14]

Given that ballistic missile defense technology has the
potential to be applied to missiles capable of destroying
satellites, attention will focus on future Chinese missile
defense trends.

**(3) Ground Forces**
China has the third largest ground forces in the world,
following India and North Korea, with approximately
970,000 personnel. China has sought to improve the
operational capabilities of ground forces pursuing the
downsizing, multifunctionality, and modularization of
military units. Specifically, it is believed to be improving
ground forces’ mobility using measures such as shifting
from theater defense to trans-theater mobility and working
to motorize and mechanize infantry units. It should be
noted that while the buildup of the Navy Marine Corps has
been completed and continues to focus on expeditionary
operations, overall, the reform and modernization of the
Navy Marine Corps has been slow. The aforementioned
goal of modernizing the military by 2020 was not achieved.
On the other hand, some analysis suggests that an additional
brigade reached fully mission capable status in 2020 and
another four brigades (one of which is an aviation brigade)
achieved initial operational capability.[15]

China has annually conducted Stride, Firepower, and
Sharp Sword maneuver-exercises that cut across multiple
regions. They are aiming at verifying and improving the
capabilities necessary to deploy army troops to remote
areas, such as long-distance maneuvering capabilities of
the Army, and logistical support capabilities that include
mobilizing militias and public transportation. China has also
conducted combined military branch and service exercises
under Joint Action since 2014. Furthermore, it has been


reported that force-on-force training has been frequently
conducted to improve practical operational capabilities.
The U.S. DoD pointed out that throughout 2020, the PLA
Army conducted large-scale exercises, and that these
exercises were implemented to prepare for escalation of
border tensions with India or an unintended contingency
with Taiwan.[16] These facts suggest China’s attempt to
improve its practical joint operational capabilities.
The above described PAP consists of internal security
corps, which are organized and established based on
administrative divisions such as provinces and autonomous
regions, mobile corps, which do not have fixed areas in
charge and perform missions across different areas, and the
Coast Guard, described later, which is said to safeguard
national sovereignty, security, and maritime interests as
well as implements law enforcement. The PAP is said to
own various equipment such as armored vehicles, rotarywing aircraft, and heavy machine guns. Furthermore, it
is reported that the PAP focuses on maintaining internal
security and joint operations with the PLA, and is
developing capabilities for readiness, mobility and counterterrorism operations.[17]

**(4) Naval Forces**
The naval forces consist of three fleets: North Sea Fleet,
East Sea Fleet, and South Sea Fleet. China’s naval forces,

which own a larger scale of ships exceeding the U.S.
Navy and are said to be the largest navy in the world,[18] are
rapidly modernizing. The Chinese Navy promotes the mass
production of its indigenous Yuan-class submarines with
improved quietness, as well as surface combatant ships
with improved air defense and anti-ship attack capabilities.
In January 2020, the Navy commissioned the first Renhaiclass destroyer among its largest destroyers, and the second,
third, and fourth destroyers were commissioned in March,
April, and November 2021. The Renhai-class destroyer is
said to be equipped with a vertical launch system (VLS) with
112 launch cells, almost twice the number of launch cells as
the new Luyang III-class destroyer. The VLS is capable of
launching long-range land-attack cruise missiles and YJ-18
anti-ship cruise missiles with a supersonic terminal attack
capability, as well as ASBMs. It has also been pointed out
that the destroyer is being considered as a launch vehicle to
defend against ballistic missiles in the mid-course phase,[19]
and that this suggests a plan for capability of carrying antiship HGVs. The destroyer could be key for the Chinese
Navy’s long-range missile capabilities in the future. In
addition, the Navy is increasing the number of large landing
ships and supply ships. Since September 2019, Yushen

class (Type-075) large landing ships have been launched
in sequence, and “Hainan,” which is believed to be the
first ship, commissioned in April 2021. In December of the
same year, it is believed that the “Guangxi,” which appears
to be the second ship, was commissioned in the Eastern
Theater Command. Furthermore, it has been pointed out
that Type-076 landing ships may be built following on
from the Yushen-class landing ship. Since September 2017,
Fuyu-class fast combat support ships (comprehensive
supply ships) have been in operation for replenishment for
the aircraft carrier group.
With regard to aircraft carriers, China’s first aircraft
carrier “Liaoning,” following its commission in September
2012, reportedly made its first advance to the South China
Sea in November 2013 and to the Pacific Ocean in December
2016. In the same month of 2016, the “Liaoning” conducted
its first comprehensive live action, including live firing by
carrier-based fighters, in the Bohai Sea. It was announced
that the “Liaoning” participated in a naval review in the
South China Sea and advanced to the Pacific Ocean for
force-on-force training including carrier-based fighters
from March to April 2018. China’s first indigenous aircraft
carrier (its second carrier) was launched in April 2017, and


18 According to the annual report “Military and Security Developments Involving the People’s Republic of China,” U.S. DoD (2021).

then it was named Shandong and commissioned in Sanya
of Hainan Island in December 2019. It is believed that the
“Shandong” passed through the Taiwan Strait in December
2020. The “Shandong,” with a ski-jump flight deck, is an
improved version of the “Liaoning,” reportedly carrying
a greater number of aircraft than the “Liaoning.” China is
reportedly building its second indigenous aircraft carrier,
which could be equipped with an electromagnetic catapult
system to operate fixed-wing early warning aircraft. It has
also been pointed out that China has plans to build nuclearpowered aircraft carriers.
China is believed to have been developing and deploying
unmanned surface vehicles (USVs) and unmanned
underwater vehicles (UUVs) that are available for military
purposes. Such equipment, though being relatively
cheap, are viewed as representing an asymmetric force
to effectively prevent adversaries from winning maritime
supremacy, particularly underwater supremacy.
Given these developments concerning the naval forces,
China appears to be steadily building up capabilities for
conducting operations in more distant waters in addition
to near sea defense. It has also been pointed out[20] that in
the near future, the Chinese Navy will have the capability
to conduct long-range precision strikes against land targets
from its submarine and surface combatants using landattack cruise missiles, and is enhancing its anti-submarine
warfare (ASW) capabilities to protect aircraft carriers
and nuclear-powered ballistic missile submarines. It is
necessary to continue to monitor the related trends.
The PAP, one of the China’s armed forces other than the
military, has the Coast Guard under its umbrella, one of
whose missions is the protection of maritime interests. The
Coast Guard consists of three groups: North, East and South
Sea Sub-bureaus. Chinese government ships belonging to
the Coast Guard have recently been designed to be larger
and armed. At the end of December 2021, the China
Coast Guard possessed 132 ships[21] with full displacement
of 1,000 tons or more, including two 10,000-ton-class
patrol ships, among the world’s largest ones. Some China
Coast Guard vessels have been confirmed as armed with
76 mm large guns that may be as powerful as the Navy
vessels. The newer ships are significantly larger and more
capable than older ships, and are equipped with helicopter
facilities, high-capacity water cannons, and guns ranging
30mm to 76mm, so that they are viewed as being able


to withstand long-term operations and engage in distantwater activities.[22]

The organizational enhancement of the Coast Guard has
also been confirmed. China’s maritime surveillance had been
conducted by the China Coast Guard Bureau under control of
the State Council’s Ministry of Public Security, as a unified
body consisting of the China Marine Surveillance (Haijian)
of the State Oceanic Administration under the Ministry of
Natural Resources, the China Fisheries Law Enforcement
Command (Yuzheng) of the Fisheries Management Bureau
under the Ministry of Agriculture, the Maritime AntiSmuggling Force of the General Administration of Customs,
etc. In July 2018, the Coast Guard was transferred to the
PAP under unified control and command of the CMC and
renamed PAP Coast Guard. After the transfer, former naval
officers were reportedly given major Coast Guard posts,
indicating enhanced cooperation between the military and
Coast Guard. It has been noted that retired naval destroyers
and frigates were delivered to the Coast Guard, suggesting
that the military has been supporting the Coast Guard in
terms of equipment as well as personnel.
At a ceremony to give the PAP a flag in January 2018,
Chairman Xi stated that the PAP would be incorporated
into the military forces’ joint operations system. It has been
pointed out that the military forces and the Coast Guard have
conducted joint exercises. The military forces and the PAP
including the Coast Guard are believed to be attempting
to steadily strengthen their joint operational capabilities
through the enhancement of cooperation. Given these
trends, progress in cooperation between the Coast Guard
and the Navy and between the Coast Guard and military
services other than the Navy should be watched closely.

(Reference)
The scope of the China Coast Guard that is transferred to the PAP and placed under its command is unknown.
Units enclosed by a red dotted line belonged to the China Coast Guard before the realignment (2013).


Amid such a situation, in June 2020, “Law of the
People’s Republic of China in the People’s Armed Police
Force (PAP Law)” was revised, and “protection of maritime
interests and law enforcement” were added to the duties of
the PAP. The revised version also stipulates that the PAP
shall be centrally and uniformly guided by the Central
Committee and the CMC of the People’s Republic of China.
In the revision of this law, the duty of “protection of the
maritime interests and law enforcement” was supposed to
be stipulated separately by law. However, the Coast Guard
Law of the People’s Republic of China (Coast Guard Law),
which stipulates the Coast Guard’s responsibilities and
authority including the use of weapons, was newly enacted
in January 2021 and entered into force in February 2021.
A Spokesperson of the Chinese Ministry of Foreign Affairs
explains that the establishment of the CCG Law is merely a
normal legislative activity of the National People’s Congress
and that China’s maritime policy has not changed. However,
the Coast Guard Law includes problematic provisions in
terms of their inconsistency with international law. Sources
of inconsistency include, among others, ambiguity as to
geographical areas the Coast Guard Law applies and how
the rules governing the use of weapons are implemented.


The Coast Guard Law must not be allowed to infringe on the
legitimate interests of the relevant countries including Japan.
Furthermore, the raising of tensions in the East China Sea
and other sea areas is completely unacceptable. The United
States and some neighboring countries have expressed
concerns about the law. In order to allay other countries’
concerns regarding China, it is strongly hoped that China
will improve transparency through specific and accurate
outward-facing explanations in the future.
It is pointed out that, among the militia, whose status is
China’s armed force other than the military, the so-called
maritime militia is playing the role of the front guard
for supporting China’s maritime interests. The maritime
militia is said to operate in the South China Sea, etc. and
consist of fishermen and residents of isolated islands. In
2009, when Chinese naval and other ships intercepted the
Impeccable, a U.S. Navy ocean surveillance ship, maritime
militia members were reportedly seen aboard a fishing boat
that was trying to remove a sonar from the U.S. ship. In
2019, when Chinese maritime survey ships were operating
in Vietnam’s exclusive economic zone, maritime militia
ships were reportedly seen along with China Coast Guard
vessels.[23] In addition, in March 2021, the Philippine


23 In addition, it is pointed out that while the maritime militia often rents fishing vessels from companies or individual fishermen, China has built a state-owned fishing fleet in the South China Sea for
the maritime militia. It is also pointed out that the Hainan provincial government, adjacent to the South China Sea, ordered the building of 84 large militia fishing vessels with reinforced hulls and
ammunition storage, which the militia received by the end of 2016, along with extensive subsidies to encourage frequent operations in the Spratly Islands. Since this maritime militia unit recruits

government announced that approximately 220 maritime
militia ships had been confirmed near Whitsun Reef in the
Spratly Islands.
Given China’s emphasis on the necessity of “fully
exerting the overall power of the military, police and
militia” on the seas, attention should be paid to these
asymmetrical forces, too.

See Fig. I-3-2-5 (The Coast Guard’s Transfer to the PAP)

See

Fig. I-3-2-6 (Buildup of China Coast Guard Vessels)

**(5) Air Forces**
China’s air forces consist mainly of the Navy’s air units and
the Air Force. As for fourth-generation fighters, China has
introduced from Russia the Su-27 and Su-30 and the Su-35
latest fourth-generation fighter. China is also developing its
own domestic modern fighters. China has started the mass
production of the J-11B fighter, a suspected copy of the
Su-27, and the J-16 fighter, a suspected copy of the Su-30,
as well as the domestic J-10 fighter. The J-15 fighter aboard
the aircraft carrier “Liaoning” is viewed as a copy of the
Russian Su-33. China has also reportedly begun to deploy
the J-20 fifth-generation fighter and been developing the
J-31. It has been pointed out that the J-31 fighter could
be the base for developing the replacement for the J-15
carrier-based fighter.
As China is continuing the modernization of its bombers
as well, the Air Force has increased the number of H-6
bombers, which are believed to be capable of carrying longrange land-attack cruise missiles with nuclear capability.
In an attempt to improve bombers’ long-range operation
capabilities, the Air Force has reportedly begun to operate
H-6N bombers that can take advantage of aerial refueling to
fly longer. It is believed to be developing a new long-range
stealth bomber called H-20. It is also pointed out that China
is developing an air-launched ballistic missile with nuclear
capability to be carried by such bombers. Moreover, it has
also been pointed out that China is developing a stealth
bomber.
China is also making continuous efforts to improve
capabilities which are essential for operations of modern
air power by introducing the H-6U and IL-78M aerial
refueling tankers and the KJ-500 and KJ-2000 early
warning and control aircraft. Since July 2016, China has
promoted the deployment of the indigenously developed
Y-20 large transport aircraft. The Y-20U, an aerial
refueling tanker based on this transport aircraft, has also
been deployed since June 2021.
China is rapidly developing a variety of domestic

unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs), including high-altitude,
long-endurance (HALE) UAVs for reconnaissance and
other purposes as well as those capable of carrying weapons
such as missiles. Some of these are deployed and actively
exported. In fact, it is suggested that the Chinese Air Force
has created a UAV unit for attack missions and frequently
used UAVs for reconnaissance and other purposes in waters
and airspace surrounding China. At the military parade

Aviation & Aerospace Exhibition, and the first exhibition
flight of several unmanned aircraft was confirmed. It has
been noted that China is improving “Swarm” technology to
operate a large number of small low-cost UAVs.
Given such modernization of the air forces, it is believed
that China is steadily improving not only its defense
capabilities for its national airspace but also capabilities for
conducting combat operations, and supporting ground and
maritime forces in more distant areas.

parties, indicating that it has recognized the importance
of taking on information mastery in wartime when it must
protect its own information systems and networks while
neutralizing those of its adversaries. In fact, the PLASSF
established at the end of 2015 apparently takes charge of
outer space, cyberspace, and electronic warfare missions
for intelligence support for all military forces.
In its white paper titled “China’s Space Activities”
and released in January 2022, China does not rule out
its use of outer space for military purposes. Given that
administrative organizations and state-owned enterprises
involved in the use of outer space in China are pointed
out as having close cooperative ties with the military,
it is considered that China is planning to improve its
capabilities for military operations in outer space.[24] China
is said to have developed its space program in the shortest
time in the world. Specifically, China has rapidly increased
the number of satellites available for military purposes in
recent years. For example, the “BeiDou” global satellite
positioning system, which is called a Chinese-version
GPS and pointed out as available for ballistic missiles and
other guided weapons systems, started its global operation
service in late 2018, and it is deemed that the launch of all
satellites constituting the BeiDou system was completed in
June 2020. Moreover, China is thought to be developing
weapons including anti-satellite weapons using missiles
and laser equipment, as well as killer satellites, in order to
restrict and interfere with the use of space-based assets by
adversaries in wartime.[25]

As for the cyber domain, China sees cybersecurity as
a serious national security threat it faces and vows that
China’s armed forces will build cyber defense capabilities,
reinforce national cyber border defense, immediately find
and block crackers, secure information network security,
and unshakably protect national cyber sovereignty,
information security, and social stability.[26] It has been
noted that current major military exercises always contain
cyber operations covering both attacks on and defense of
command systems. Cyber attacks on enemy networks are
likely to bolster China’s “A2/AD” capabilities. The militia
as a part of China’s armed forces reportedly includes
“cyber militias” with excellent cyber domain capabilities.
It has also been pointed out that the Chinese military
routinely conducts various force-on-force exercises in an


electronic warfare environment. In addition, the presence
of aircraft with electronic warfare capabilities has been
noted. Y-8 electronic warfare aircraft, which frequently fly
near Japan, are pointed out along with J-15 carrier-based
fighters, J-16 fighters and H-6 bombers that appear to be
equipped with electronic warfare pod systems giving them
electronic warfare capabilities.

**(7) China’s “Intelligentization” of its Military Forces**
The “intelligentized warfare” advocated by China is
described as “integrated warfare waged in land, sea, air,
space, electromagnetic, cyber, and cognitive domains using
intelligent weaponry and equipment and their associated
operational methods, underpinned by the IoT information
system”. The “cognitive domain” may become important
in future aspects of warfare. The Taiwan National Defense
Report 2021 released in November 2021 also expresses
concern about “cognitive warfare,” which attempts to create
social disorder by manipulating and disrupting the public’s
mentality through the deployment of “Three Warfares”
(psychological warfare, public opinion warfare, and legal
warfare) and the dissemination of disinformation via social
media and other means. It is believed that warfare in the
“cognitive domain” is already emerging and in progress.
In addition, as aspects of “intelligentized warfare,”
the U.S. DoD, citing the views of Chinese military
strategists, has pointed out that new technologies will
increase the speed and tempo of future warfare, and that
operationalization of AI will be necessary to improve
the speed and quality of information processing by
reducing battlefield uncertainty and to provide decision
making advantage over potential adversaries. The PLA
is also exploring next-generation operational concepts
for intelligentized warfare, including attrition warfare by
intelligent swarms, AI-based space confrontation, and
cognitive control operations. Furthermore, it has been
pointed out that the PLA considers unmanned systems to
be critical intelligentized technologies, and is pursuing
autonomy for unmanned land, sea, and air assets to enable
manned and unmanned hybrid formations, swarm attacks,
optimized logistic support, and disaggregated intelligence,
surveillance, and reconnaissance (ISR) operations.[27]

**(8) Efforts to Develop Joint Operational Capabilities**
In recent years, initiatives have been under way to improve
joint operational capabilities in areas from the front line
to logistics. The CMC Joint Operations Command Center
is believed to have been established under the initiatives
for the CCP to carry out decision making at the highest
strategic level. The five new theaters established in February
2016 are seen as representing permanent joint operation
headquarters. Given that the Navy’s Vice-Admiral Yuan
Yubai and the Air Force’s Commander Yi Xiaoguang were
named theater commanders in January and October 2017,
respectively for the first time from branches other than
the Army, attention is being paid to the progress towards
joint operations in the area of human resources. In recent
years, China has implemented tri-service joint exercises
giving priority to practicality and other drills to improve
its joint operational capabilities. These drills are apparently
designed to secure the effectiveness of the abovementioned
organizational reforms and other initiatives to improve
joint operational capabilities. In response to the novel
coronavirus disease, which emerged in China from late
2019, China has reportedly implemented not only joint
military operations but also the mobilization of civil
resources. The Joint Logistics Support Force specialized
in logistics has played a core military role in the response
while receiving support from each theater and service. In
addition, militias and national-defense-mobilized personnel
have also reportedly participated in the response, which
has attracted attention as a case indicating comprehensive
joint logistic support capabilities.
At the 19th CCP National Congress in October 2017,
General Secretary Xi reiterated enhancing joint operational
capabilities and the pursuit of practical capabilities of a
military that “can fight and win a war.” More recently, at
a CMC meeting on military training in November 2020,
General Secretary Xi also stated that the strengthening
and developing of joint training and the enhancement of
joint operational capabilities need to be accelerated. Given
these remarks, the abovementioned moves towards joint
operations are expected to progress further.

**6 Maritime and Airspace Activities**

**(1) General Situation**
Recently, China is believed to be aiming to build up
capabilities for operations in more distant waters and
airspace, including those to project power to waters
including the so called second island chain beyond


the first island chain. In such efforts, China has rapidly
expanded and intensified its activities in the maritime and
aerial domains using its naval and air powers. In waters
and airspace surrounding Japan, particularly, Chinese
naval vessels, and naval and air force aircraft suspected as
conducting training and information gathering activities
have been frequently observed, along with Chinese
naval ships heading for the Pacific and Indian Ocean and
numerous China Coast Guard vessels and aircraft operating
under the name of protecting maritime interests. Their
activities include China Coast Guard vessels’ intermittent
intrusions into Japan’s territorial waters, Chinese aircraft’s
intrusions into Japan’s airspace, and dangerous acts
that could cause unintended consequences, such as the
direction of fire-control radar at Japanese Self-Defense
Forces (SDF) ships and aircraft, Chinese military fighter
jets’ abnormally close approach to Japanese SDF and
U.S. military aircraft, and the establishment of the “East
China Sea ADIZ” and other activities that could infringe
upon the freedom of overflight. These activities have
become a matter of grave concern and are very deplorable.
In the South China Sea, China is moving forward with
militarization, and expanding and intensifying its activities
in the maritime and aerial domains, attempting to create a
fait accompli for unilaterally changing the status quo by
coercion. It is strongly hoped that China will act on the
basis of the principle of the rule of law and play active roles
in the region and the international community in a more
cooperative manner.

**(2) Military Activities in Japan’s Surrounding**
**Waters and Airspace**

The Chinese Navy and Air Force have in recent years
expanded and intensified their activities in the surrounding
sea areas and airspace of Japan, including the area
surrounding the Senkaku Islands. These activities include
those allegedly based on China’s unilateral claim on
the Senkaku Islands, and cases involving the one-sided
escalation of activities, creating a situation of great
concern to Japan. The Air Self-Defense Force (ASDF)
has continued to make frequent scrambles against Chinese
aircraft, as indicated by an all-time high of 851 scrambles
in FY2016. China has also continued naval ships’ passage
through waters near Japan for navigation to distant waters
such as the Indian Ocean, as well as activities viewed as
training of maritime and air forces making forays to the
Pacific and the Sea of Japan. Recently, in October 2021,
China and Russia conducted joint exercises in the Sea of


**Chapter**
**3**


-----

Japan with the participation of naval vessels, including
the aforementioned Renhai-class destroyer, the largest
destroyer in the PLA Navy. Furthermore, continuing on
from this, a total of 10 naval vessels from both countries
conducted military exercises while navigating around
Japan (Sea of Japan - Tsugaru Strait – east of Inubosaki

-  Izu Islands - Osumi Strait - south of the Danjo Islands),
which is believed to have been intended as a show of force
against Japan. Moreover, in November 2021, the third
long-distance joint flight with Russia was conducted, with
bombers passing through Russian airspace directly to the
Sea of Japan and then flying to the East China Sea and
the Pacific Ocean. In May 2022, the fourth long-distance
joint flight with Russia in four consecutive years was
conducted, flying from the East China Sea to the Sea of
Japan and the Pacific Ocean. Although China can be
suspected of intending to “regularize” these activities,
there is a view that China is attempting to take advantage
of the “regularization” to alleviate concerns over these
activities. At the same time, it appears that China continues
to improve the complexity of its activities. Given that
Chinese efforts are also seen to improve practical joint
operational capabilities, Chinese military activities in
Japan’s surrounding waters and airspace should be closely
watched with grave attention.
a. Activities in the East China Sea (including the Areas
around the Senkaku Islands)
Chinese naval vessels have been conducting operations in
the East China Sea continuously and actively. Stating its
own position regarding Japan’s Senkaku Islands, China
claims that patrols by Chinese naval vessels in the sea areas
under its jurisdiction are completely justifiable and lawful.
Chinese naval vessels have been continuously operating
in the areas near Japan’s Senkaku Islands. In June 2016,
a Jiangkai I-class frigate became the first ever Chinese
Navy combatant vessel to enter Japan’s contiguous zone
around the Senkaku Islands. Furthermore, in January 2018,
a Shang-class submerged submarine and a Jiangkai II-class
frigate passed into the contiguous zone around the Senkaku
Islands on the same day. This was the first time a Chinese
submarine was identified and announced as conducting
submerged transit through the contiguous waters off
the Senkaku Islands. In June 2020 and September 2021,
submerged transit of a submarine presumed to belong to
China was confirmed in the contiguous zone surrounding
Amami Oshima Island. In recent years, Chinese Navy
intelligence gathering vessels (AGIs) have also been
found conducting activities in multiple cases A Chinese


Navy Dongdiao-class AGI repeatedly navigated back
and forth outside of the contiguous zone south of the
Senkaku Islands in November 2015. In June 2016, an AGI
of the same type sailed in Japan’s territorial waters near
Kuchinoerabujima Island and Yakushima Island, and then
passed Japan’s contiguous zone north of Kitadaitojima
Island. Subsequently, the vessel repeatedly conducted
east-west passages outside the contiguous zone south of
the Senkaku Islands. Furthermore, in November 2021 and
April 2022, a PLA Navy Shupang-class survey ship sailed
through Japan’s territorial waters near Kuchinoerabujima
Island and Yakushima Island.
China’s air forces are also actively conducting activities
in the East China Sea on a routine basis. Their activities
are thought to include warning and surveillance, combat air
patrols (CAPs), and training. Chinese military aircraft have
recently become more active in airspace closer to Japan’s
Southwestern Islands. Their activities have possibly been
intended to operate the “East China Sea ADIZ.” In April
2018, an alleged BZK-005 unmanned reconnaissance
vehicle was identified flying over the East China Sea. In
August 2021, an alleged TB-001 unmanned reconnaissance/
attack vehicle and BZK-005 unmanned reconnaissance
vehicle along with a Y-9 intelligence gathering aircraft and
Y-9 patrol aircraft, were confirmed flying from the East
China Sea to the Pacific Ocean via the waters between
the main island of Okinawa and Miyakojima Island on
consecutive days. Furthermore, Chinese military aircraft
have been confirmed as operating in airspace close to the
Senkaku Islands in recent years.
b. Advancements into the Pacific Ocean
Chinese Navy combatant vessels continue to transit the
waters near Japan to advance into the Pacific Ocean and
return to base with high frequency. The advancement
routes are multiplying. Chinese naval vessels have been
confirmed as transiting the sea area between the main island
of Okinawa and Miyakojima Island, and have been found
passing through the Osumi Strait, the sea area between
Yonagunijima Island and Nakanokamishima Island near
Iriomotejima Island, the sea area between Amamioshima
Island and Yokoatejima Island, the Tsugaru Strait, and the
Soya Strait. Through these activities, China has apparently
attempted to “regularize” naval ships’ advancements into
the Pacific Ocean through waters near Japan and improve
its capabilities for accessing the open ocean and conducting
operations there. In December 2016, the aircraft carrier
“Liaoning” navigated the East China Sea together with
other vessels and passed the sea area between the main


**Chapter**
**3**


-----

island of Okinawa and Miyakojima Island to advance to the
Pacific for the first time. In April 2018, the Chinese Ministry
of National Defense announced that the aircraft carrier
“Liaoning” and multiple other vessels passed through the
Bashi Channel to advance to the Pacific and conducted
force-on-force exercises that included carrier-based
fighters. At that time, the Japanese Maritime Self-Defense
Force (MSDF), conducting warning and surveillance,
confirmed for the first time the carrier used for what were
presumed to be carrier-based fighters for take-off and
landing in the Pacific Ocean. Moreover, the aircraft carrier
“Liaoning” advanced to the Pacific Ocean through the sea
area between the main island of Okinawa and Miyakojima
Island in June 2019, together with vessels such as a Fuyuclass fast combat support ship for supplying the aircraft
carrier group. Furthermore, in April 2020, a fleet, including
the aircraft carrier “Liaoning,” passed through the waters
of the main island of Okinawa and Miyakojima Island to
enter the Pacific Ocean, and deployed through the Bashi
Strait to the South China Sea. Later, the fleet again passed
through the Bashi Strait and entered the Pacific Ocean.
Within the same month it passed through the waters of the
main island of Okinawa and Miyakojima Island to the East
China Sea. In addition, in April and December 2021, and
May 2022, a fleet including the aircraft carrier “Liaoning”
and the Renhai-class destroyer were seen passing through
the waters of the main island of Okinawa and Miyakojima
Island southward to the Pacific Ocean, and then within the
same month navigated northward through the same sea
area to the East China Sea. Carrier-based fighters from the
fleet, which included the aircraft carrier “Liaoning” and
passed through the waters of the main island of Okinawa
and Miyakojima Island southward to the Pacific Ocean,
were also confirmed to have taken off and landed over
the Pacific Ocean during the fleet’s April 2020, April
and December 2021, and May 2022 navigations. In May
2022, the PLA Eastern Theater Command announced
that it had organized naval, air, and conventional missile
forces to conduct practical drills in the sea and airspace
east and southwest of Taiwan and verify the integrated
operational capabilities of multiple military branches. In
addition, during the May 2022 navigation, carrier-based
fighters were confirmed to have taken off and landed in
sea areas closer to Japan than ever confirmed before. The
activities, such as the nighttime landing and departure of
aircraft first confirmed in December 2021, are worthy of


H-6K bomber (China)

attention as indicating the enhancement of the capabilities
of China’s naval forces, including the aircraft carrier, and
the improvement of its capabilities to project power to
more distant areas.
Regarding air forces, the advancement of a PLAN Y-8
early warning aircraft into the Pacific Ocean, passing
the waters between the main island of Okinawa and
Miyakojima Island, was confirmed for the first time in
July 2013. The advancement of Air Force aircraft into the
Pacific was also confirmed in 2015. Since 2017, advances
into the Pacific Ocean via this airspace have become more
active. The types of aircraft passing through the airspace
have also diversified year by year. H-6K bombers and
Su-30 fighters were confirmed by 2016 and the Y-8 EW
aircraft in July 2017. At least one bomber was confirmed
as carrying objects in the form of missiles. The U.S. DoD
has pointed out that such Chinese bomber flights indicated
the Chinese forces’ training targeting the United States
and its allies.[28] Flight patterns of Chinese military aircraft
have also been changing. Flights from the East China Sea
to the Pacific Ocean, passing the waters between the main
island of Okinawa and Miyakojima Island, and from the
direction of the Bashi Channel to the Pacific Ocean, both
with the return trips on the same shuttle routes, have been
repeatedly made. Since November 2016, H-6K bombers
and other aircraft were confirmed as flying around Taiwan.
In August 2017, H-6K bombers were confirmed as flying to
waters off the Kii Peninsula after advancing to the Pacific
Ocean via waters between the main island of Okinawa and
Miyakojima Island for the first time. Through frequent
long-distance flights of bombers and other aircraft,
including advancements to the Pacific, and their advanced


**Chapter**

-----

flight paths and composition, China is thought to be
demonstrating its presence around areas including those
surrounding Japan, and planning further enhancements to
more practical operational capabilities.
Additionally, activities considered planned to improve
sea and air joint operational capabilities in more distant
areas, such as what seemed to be air-to-ship attack drills
including advancements to the Pacific Ocean, have been
seen in recent years. In April 2019 and February 2020,
the PLA Eastern Theater Command announced that
joint training was conducted in waters east of Taiwan.
Furthermore, in August and September 2021, the PLA
Eastern Theater Command announced that joint training
was conducted in the sea and airspace southwest and
southeast of Taiwan. China is expected to further expand
and intensify naval and air activities in the Pacific Ocean.
c. Activities in the Sea of Japan
While the Chinese Navy has been active in the Sea of Japan
during training and on other occasions for some time, its
Air Force activities in the area have also intensified of
late. “Force-on-force exercises” in the Sea of Japan by
Chinese Navy ships were announced for the first time in
August 2016. Three aircraft apparently participated in the
exercises, including two H-6 bombers that passed through
the Tsushima Strait into the Sea of Japan for the first time.
In December 2017, Chinese Air Force aircraft (H-6K
bombers) passed through the Tsushima Strait and advanced
to the Sea of Japan. Then, Chinese fighter aircraft (Su-30
fighters) were confirmed as advancing to the Sea of Japan
for the first time. In February 2018, it was confirmed for
the first time that the Y-9 intelligence gathering aircraft
entered the Sea of Japan via the Western Channel of
Tsushima Strait (the strait between Tsushima in Nagasaki
Prefecture and the Korean Peninsula). As for naval forces,
in March 2021, the Renhai-class destroyer was confirmed
for the first time to have sailed through the Tsushima Strait
into the Sea of Japan.
Since 2018, China’s sea and air forces have further
intensified activities in the Sea of Japan involving passages
through the Tsushima Strait. It is considered that the PLA
will continue to expand and intensify its activities in the
Sea of Japan.

**(3)** **Activities of Chinese Ships Including Coast Guard**
**Vessels, and Aircraft around the Senkaku Islands, etc.**

China Coast Guard vessels have been seen almost every
day in the contiguous zone of the Senkaku Islands, Japan’s
inherent territory and repeatedly intruded into Japan’s


territorial waters. Since the activities of China Coast Guard
vessels based on China’s own assertion conducted in
Japan’s territorial waters around the Senkaku Islands are
violating international law in the first place, Japan has been
strongly protesting against these activities and requested
them to leave many times. Despite Japan’s strong protests,
however, Chinese Coast Guard vessels continued to intrude
into Japan’s territorial waters in FY2021. Almost every
month in 2021, China Coast Guard vessels entered Japan’s
territorial waters and attempted to approach Japanese
fishing boats which were navigating in the area. China
Coast Guard vessels entered Japan’s territorial waters
around the Senkaku Islands and stayed there for more than
57 hours, the longest period ever, in October 2020.
Providing the background, in December 2008, China
Maritime Surveillance vessels intruded into Japan’s
territorial waters for the first time and hovered and
drifted, running counter to international law. Later,
China Maritime Surveillance and China Fisheries Law
Enforcement Command vessels gradually intensified
their activities in Japan’s territorial waters. Such activities
have greatly intensified since September 2012, when the
Japanese Government acquired the ownership of three
of the Senkaku Islands (Uotsurishima Island, Kitakojima
Island, and Minamikojima Island). The number of Chinese
government ships intruding into Japan’s territorial waters
in a day had been limited to two or three until August 2016.
Later, however, the number has reached four frequently.
China is seen to be steadily strengthening an operational
posture intended to use Coast Guard vessels to intrude
into Japan’s territorial waters. Specifically, vessels sent to
waters near the Senkaku Islands have grown larger in size.
At least one of the vessels intruding into Japan’s territorial
waters has been a 3,000-ton or larger vessel since August
2014. Since February 2015, three 3,000-ton or larger
vessels have been confirmed as entering Japan’s territorial
waters simultaneously. Since December of the same year,
Chinese ships armed with what appear to be cannons have
repeatedly intruded into Japan’s territorial waters.
Cases indicating the improvement of China Coast Guard
vessels’ operational capabilities have been also confirmed.
From February to July 2021, China Coast Guard vessels
were seen in the contiguous zone of the Senkaku Islands
for a record 157 consecutive days. In that year, China Coast
Guard vessels were seen in the contiguous zone of the
Senkaku Islands for 332 days. The total number of China
Coast Guard vessels seen in the zone was 1,222. Both
numbers were the highest since 2020


**Chapter**

-----

Additionally, cases indicating China s capabilities to
send numerous China Coast Guard vessels and other ships
to waters around the Senkaku Islands simultaneously have
also been identified. In early August 2016, approximately
200 to 300 Chinese fishing boats advanced to the contiguous
zone of the Senkaku Islands. At that time, as many as up
to 15 China Coast Guard vessels and other ships were
confirmed in the contiguous zone simultaneously. Over
five days, a large number of China Coast Guard vessels,
other ships, and fishing boats repeatedly intruded into
Japan’s territorial waters.
In December 2012, a fixed-wing aircraft of the State
Oceanic Administration was identified as the first Chinese
aircraft to intrude into Japan’s airspace around the Senkaku


China has thus relentlessly continued attempts to
unilaterally change the status quo by coercion in the sea
area around the Senkaku Islands, leading to a matter of
grave concern. Japan cannot accept China’s actions to
escalate the situation.
Among waters other than those around the Senkaku
Islands, China Coad Guard vessels were confirmed as
passing through Japan’s territorial waters around Tsushima
Island (Nagasaki Prefecture), Okinoshima Island (Fukuoka
Prefecture) and the Tsugaru Strait in July 2017. The same
vessels were also confirmed to have sailed in Japan’s
territorial waters from Sata Cape to the Kusagaki Islands
(both in Kagoshima Prefecture) in August that year. In
July 2019, a China Coast Guard vessel was seen sailing

it was reported that anti-ship cruise missiles and surfaceto-air missiles were deployed on Fiery Cross, Subi and
Mischief Reefs for military training and that radar jamming
systems were deployed on Mischief Reef. Furthermore, it
was reported in May 2020 that China possibly deployed
aircraft including Y-8 patrol and Y-9 early warning aircraft
and other aircraft to the Fiery Cross Reef in rotation.
On the other four features, it is pointed out that the
construction of facilities, such as harbors, helipads, and
radars, has made progress and that what appears to be large
anti-aircraft guns and close in weapon systems (CIWS)
may have already been deployed. If these features are
used for full-scale military purposes, it could significantly
change the security environment in the Indo-Pacific region.
China carried out the militarization of the Paracel Islands
before that of the Spratly Islands. China has reportedly
extended the runway to nearly 3,000 m on Woody Island
since 2013. In October 2015, October 2017, and June
2019, China was reported to have deployed J-11, J-10 and
other fighters on the island. In February 2016 and January
2017, the existence of equipment likely to be surface-to-air
missiles was confirmed. It has been noted that the takeoff
and landing training of the H-6K bombers in the South
China Sea announced by the Chinese Ministry of National
Defense in May 2018 was carried out on Woody Island.
In recent years, Chinese vessels have allegedly been
conducting what are likely to be survey activities in
Scarborough Shoal, where a standoff took place between
Chinese and Philippine government ships in April 2012. It
is pointed out that new land reclamations on the shoal might
be seen in the future. It is also pointed out that if China
conducts land reclamations and installs radar facilities,
runways, and other infrastructure on Scarborough Shoal,
it could possibly increase its ability for situation awareness
and power projection capabilities in the surrounding sea
area and ultimately enhance its operational capabilities
throughout all the areas of the South China Sea. Attention
must continue to be paid to the situation going forward.
The activities in sea and airspace are expanding and
intensifying as well. In March 2009, December 2013
and September 2018, Chinese naval and other vessels
approached and intercepted U.S. Navy vessels navigating
in the South China Sea. In May 2016, February 2017
and May 2017, PLA fighters allegedly flew close to
U.S. Forces aircraft. In July and August 2016, after the
Philippines-China arbitration award was rendered, PLAAF
H-6K bomber aircraft conducted “combat air patrol” in
the airspace close to Scarborough Shoal The Chinese

**(4) Trends of Activities in the South China Sea**
China has also been intensifying its activities based on
assertions, which are conflicting with existing laws and
orders of the seas, in the South China Sea, including waters
around the Spratly Islands and the Paracel Islands, over
which territorial disputes exist with neighbors, including
some member states of the Association of Southeast Asian
Nations (ASEAN).
Since 2014, on seven features of the Spratly Islands
(Fiery Cross Reef, Mischief Reef, Subi Reef, Cuarteron
Reef, Gaven Reefs, Hughes Reef, and Johnson South
Reef), China pressed ahead with large-scale and rapid
land reclamation. The Philippines-China arbitration award
issued in July 2016 denied the “historic rights” as the basis
of the “nine-dash line” claimed by China, and determined
the illegality of China’s activities such as land reclamation.
However, China has made it clear that it would not comply
with the award and is currently continuing military activities
while promoting the development of military facilities,
such as batteries, and various kinds of infrastructure that
can be used for military purposes, including runways, ports,
hangars, and radar facilities, to militarize these features.
On Fiery Cross, Subi and Mischief Reefs, called the Big
Three of the Spratly Islands, China has developed batteries
for anti-aircraft guns, missile shelters, underground storage
facilities pointed out to be munitions storage, large ports
capable of accommodating combatant ships and runways
available for takeoff and landing of fighters and bombers.
On Fiery Cross Reef in April 2016, a Navy patrol
aircraft flying over the South China Sea landed for a
nominal purpose of evacuating emergency patients. On
Subi and Mischief Reefs in July of the same year, China
forced aircraft test flights on runways available for the
takeoff and landing of large aircraft. Reportedly, there was
confirmation of a Y-7 transport aircraft on Mischief Reef in
January 2018, a Y-8 special mission aircraft on Subi Reef in
April that year, a Y-20 transport airport on Fiery Cross Reef
in December 2020, and a KJ-500 early warning aircraft on
Fiery Cross Reef in June 2021 Additionally in April 2018

Ministry of National Defense announced that this patrol
would “become normal.” In December 2016, H-6 bombers
reportedly flew along the so-called nine-dash line. In
September of the same year, the China-Russia bilateral
naval exercise “Joint Sea 2016” was conducted for the first
time in the South China Sea.
A field training exercise by naval vessels including the
aircraft carrier “Liaoning” and a naval review ceremony,
regarded as the largest since the founding of China, were
conducted in the same area from the end of March until
April 2018. In 2019, anti-ship ballistic missile tests were
reportedly conducted in the South China Sea for the first
time. In 2019 and 2020, the deployment of the aircraft
carrier “Liaoning” accompanied by Fuyu-class fast combat
support and other ships in the South China Sea was reported.
Furthermore, China Coast Guard vessels reportedly fired
warning shots at fishing boats of neighboring countries.
When China Coast Guard vessels interrupted Vietnam’s oil
and natural gas development within its exclusive economic
zone from July to October 2019, they reportedly visited
Fiery Cross Reef for supply.
In April 2020, China unilaterally announced the
establishment of Xisha (Paracel) District and Nansha
(Spratly) District under Sansha City in the Hainan province.
China conducted simultaneous military exercises in three
sea areas (South China Sea, East China Sea, and Yellow
Sea) in July and is believed to have launched middle-range
ballistic missiles in August 2020.
Furthermore, it was announced that the aircraft carrier
“Shandong” conducted an exercise in the South China
Sea in May 2021, and reported that another exercise was
conducted in early winter of the same year. In June of the
same year, the Malaysian Air Force announced that 16
Chinese military aircraft had flown over the Luconia Shoal
and approached as far as the Malaysian coast. In addition,
in December of the same year, it was also reported that
the aforementioned Yushen-class landing ship conducted
a series of exercises in the South China Sea, and that
exercises were conducted at several locations on Hainan
Island facing the South China Sea. It was pointed out that
the latter exercises in particular were possibly exercises
simulating an amphibious operation using Hainan Island
against Taiwan.
In this way, it appears that China seeks to expand its
presence and enhance war-sustaining and other joint
operational capabilities including military and other means
in the South China Sea.
Such activities conducted by China based on its own


assertions, which are conflicting with existing laws and
orders of the seas, unilaterally change the status quo and
further advance its efforts to create a fait accompli. Japan
is deeply concerned about these activities, and the concern
is shared with the international community, including the
United States and other G7 Member States. For example,
in July 2020, the United States issued a statement from the
U.S. Secretary of State saying that China’s maritime claims
in the South China Sea were unlawful. In January 2022,
the State Department issued a report stating that China’s
unlawful territorial and jurisdictional claims gravely
undermined the rule of law in the oceans.
China asserts that some of the ASEAN member states
including the Philippines and Vietnam are illegitimately
occupying features. However, China’s development work
on the features is of a scale incomparable to the activities
carried out by other countries and is conducted at a rapid
pace.
In any case, the issues surrounding the South China
Sea are directly related to peace and stability in the IndoPacific region and are a legitimate concern not only for
Japan, which has major sea lanes in the South China Sea,
but also for the entire international community. Countries
concerned, including China, are urged to refrain from
unilateral actions that heighten tension and to act on the
basis of the principle of the rule of law.

**(5)** **Trends in the Indian Ocean and Other More Distant Waters**
The Chinese Navy is considered to be shifting towards
“protection missions on the far seas” and has been steadily
increasing its capabilities to conduct operations in more
distant waters, such as the Indian Ocean, in recent years.
Progress has been seen in the Navy’s development of such
equipment as large combatant ships and replenishment
ships and in its operational initiatives. For example, since
December 2008, Chinese Navy vessels have been deployed
off the coast of Somalia and in the Gulf of Aden to take part
in international counter-piracy efforts. In December 2019,
the Chinese Navy conducted its first multilateral exercise
with its Russian and Iranian counterparts in the northern
Indian Ocean. Activities of Chinese Navy submarines
have also been confirmed continuously in the Indian
Ocean. They have been reported to make port calls at Sri
Lanka’s Colombo, Pakistan’s Karachi, and Malaysia’s
Kota Kinabalu. In January 2020, China reportedly sent a
submarine for drills with Pakistan in the northern Arabian

its Belt and Road Initiative (BRI) whose main purpose is
advertised as establishing an economic zone in regions
including the Eurasian continent, with the Chinese military
possibly taking on the role of the shield behind the
initiative by such means as the stabilization of areas via
counter-piracy activities and the improvement of counterterrorism capabilities in coastal states through bilateral and
multilateral exercises. While it is thought that the initiative
includes a strategic intention to expand its influence in the
region, it is possible that the initiative will further improve
the PLA’s operational capabilities in the Indian Ocean,
Pacific Ocean and elsewhere. For example, China’s support
for the construction of port infrastructure in Pakistan, Sri
Lanka, Bangladesh and other Indian Ocean countries as
well as Pacific island countries including Vanuatu could
lead China to secure outposts available for its military
purposes.

**(6) Objectives of Activities in Waters and Airspace**
The development and activities of Chinese naval and
air forces, descriptions in defense white papers, China’s
geographical conditions and globalizing economy, and
other factors indicate that the recent water and airspace
activities of the Navy, Air Force and other Chinese
organizations have the following objectives:
The first is to intercept operations by adversaries in
waters and airspace as far as possible from China in order to
defend its territorial land, waters and airspace. Behind this
objective is an increase in the effectiveness of long-range
attacks due to recent progress in science and technology.
The second is to develop capabilities to deter and
prevent Taiwan’s independence. China maintains that
it will not allow any foreign intervention in solving the
Taiwan issue and realizing the unification of China. To
ensure the prevention of foreign intervention in the Taiwan
issue, China needs to enhance its operational capabilities at
sea and airspace as Taiwan is surrounded by the sea in all

**KEY WORD**

**“Belt and Road” Initiative**

A concept for an economic sphere proposed by President Xi Jinping.
The “Silk Road Economic Belt” (“One Belt”) and the “21st Century
Maritime Silk Road” (“One Road”) were announced in September
and October 2013, respectively. Since then, the two concepts are
collectively referred to as the “Belt and Road” Initiative.


directions.
The third is to weaken the control of other countries on


islands subject to China s territorial claims and enhance
the claims through various surveillance activities and use
of force in waters and airspace surrounding these islands.
Such activities are considered to also have the purpose
of creating a fait accompli as part of the reasons for
unilaterally changing the status quo and justifying China’s
claims based on its own concept of “legal warfare.”
The fourth is to acquire, maintain, and protect its
maritime rights and interests. China is engaged in oil and
gas drilling as well as building facilities and surveying in
the East and South China Seas. It has been confirmed that
in addition to the existing four platforms, China has built
12 additional offshore platforms on the Chinese side of
the Japan-China median line of the East China Sea since
June 2013, and was also confirmed to be moving toward
installing a new structure in May 2022 as well. In late
June 2016, the installment of an anti-surface vessel radar
and a surveillance camera was confirmed on one of the
platforms. Attention is to be paid to matters regarding the
platforms, including the purpose of such equipment. Japan
has repeatedly lodged protests against China’s unilateral
development and demanded the termination of such work.
The fifth is to defend its sea lanes of communications.
In the background is the fact that its sea lanes, including its
oil transportation routes from the Middle East, are essential
for the Chinese economy. Given the recent strengthening
of the Chinese Navy and Air Force, it is believed that they
have been expanding military capabilities to cover distant
waters beyond China’s near seas.
Given these objectives of China’s water and airspace
activities and recent trends, it is believed that China plans
to further expand the sphere of its activities, and further
intensify its operations in waters surrounding Japan,
including the East China Sea and the Pacific Ocean, as well
as in the South China Sea and the Indian Ocean.
Meanwhile, in recent years, China has shown interest in
taking steps to avoid and prevent unexpected contingencies
in sea areas and airspace. For example, in April 2014,
China, together with other countries such as Japan and the
United States, adopted the Code for Unplanned Encounters
at Sea (CUES), which sets forth the standards of behavior
in the case that the naval vessels or aircraft of the Western
Pacific Naval Symposium (WPNS) member states have
unexpected encounters. Also, in June 2018, Japan and
China started the implementation of their Maritime and
Air Communication Mechanism between the Defense
Authorities to avoid unexpected collisions between SDF
and PLA vessels and aircraft

exercises, landing exercises, inter-theater exercises, and
large exercises including distant ones, as well as night-time
exercises and joint exercises with other countries, in order
to strengthen its operational capabilities. The new military
training regulations in effect since January 2018 referred
to the execution of joint and full-spectrum operation
based on network information systems, in addition to the
definite implementation of practical training as a principle.
Moreover, the trial regulation on the supervision of military
training that took effect in March 2019 is regarded as
China’s first attempt to put in place a system that prescribes
measures for rectifying practices that are inconsistent
with the requirements of actual combat and criteria for
identifying malpractice and discipline violations during
military training.
In the education spectrum as well, the PLA aims to train
soldiers who have the ability to execute joint operations.
In 2003, it launched a human resource strategy project
to develop human resources capable of directing joint
and informatized operations, and of building joint and
informatized armed forces. It was reported in 2017 that
the PLA National Defense University began training
to develop human resources capable of directing joint
operations. In addition, the Law of the People’s Republic of
China on the Protection of the Status, Rights and Interests
of Military Personnel was enacted in June 2021, and the
Military Service Law of the People’s Republic of China
was revised in August. These lead to making the military
more appealing by improving and ensuring the status of
military personnel and their treatment, including of their
families, as well as protecting their honor. Such moves by
China to strengthen the military’s human resources base
are considered important for securing more outstanding
personnel and building the “world-class forces” that China
is aiming for, and will be closely watched in the future.
China has been developing defense mobilization
systems in order to effectively utilize private resources
in case of emergencies, including wars. It enforced the
National Defense Mobilization Law as the basic law for
defense mobilizations in 2010 and the National Defense
Transportation Law for the transportation area in 2016.
The “civil-military fusion” policy that China is currently
promoting is believed to have its sights set on the routine
military use of civilian resources not only in emergencies
but also in peacetime. The military use of civilian
resources includes civilian ships’ transportation of military
equipment. As such initiative generally augments China’s
forces available for military missions and is expected to


**7 International Military Activities**

In recent years, the PLA has been indicating its positive
attitude on nontraditional security missions such as
peacekeeping, humanitarian assistance and disaster relief,
and counterpiracy, dispatching numerous units for such
overseas missions.
China has vowed to consistently support and actively
participate in UN PKO, increasing its presence in UN
PKO. China, for the first time, released a white paper
regarding its involvement in UN PKO in September
2020 titled “China’s Armed Forces: 30 Years of UN
Peacekeeping Operations.” According to this white paper,
China has sent more than 40,000 military personnel on
25 missions of UN PKO. According to the UN, as of the
end of December 2021, China had a total of 2,235 troops,
civilian police and military observers - the largest number
of peacekeepers among the permanent members of the UN
Security Council - engaged in UN peacekeeping activities,
including the United Nations Multidimensional Integrated
Stabilization Mission in Mali (MINUSMA). China has
also largely increased its share of the UN PKO budget. The
Chinese share has remained the second largest, after the
U.S. share, since 2016.
Moreover, China has been actively participating in
counter-piracy activities off the coast of Somalia and in
the Gulf of Aden as well as humanitarian assistance and
disaster relief activities. In 2011, in view of the deteriorating
situation in Libya, China carried out a military evacuation
of Chinese nationals for the first time.
It is pointed out that factors behind such Chinese attitude
include the growing need for protecting and promoting
China’s national interests overseas following the expansion
of national interests beyond its national borders, China’s
attempt to verify military capabilities including units’
long-distance deployment, its intent to raise its status by
demonstrating its will to fulfill its responsibilities to the
international community, its hope to diffuse the military’s
peaceful and humanitarian images, and its attempt to
enhance relations with PKO regions including African
countries.

**8 Education and Training**

In recent years, the PLA under the policy of building
a military that “can fight and win a war” has promoted
practical exercises including large-scale ones such as
joint exercises led by theater commands force on force

proactively be promoted in the future, the initiative s
implications for the Chinese military forces’ operational
capabilities should be watched closely.

**9 National Defense Industry Sector**

Under the State Administration of Science, Technology and
Industry for National Defense (SASTIND) of the Ministry
of Industry and Information Technology, a department
of the State Council, China’s main national defense
industry had consisted of 12 corporations to develop
and produce nuclear weapons, missiles and rockets,
aircraft, vessels, information systems and other military
equipment. The Chinese national defense industry’s arms
sales were pointed out as the second largest after those
in the United States in 2017.[31] In 2018, China National
Nuclear Corporation and China Nuclear Engineering &
Construction Corporation was reorganized. After China
State Shipbuilding Corporation merged with China
Shipbuilding Industry Corporation in 2019, the industry
now comprises 10 corporations including China State
Shipbuilding Corporation.
While China imports highly sophisticated military
equipment and parts that it cannot produce domestically
from other countries such as Russia, it is believed that
China places emphasis on the enhancement of its military
industrial sector, including the domestic production of
equipment, to modernize its military. It has been pointed out
that China is acquiring technologies ambitiously not only
through domestic technology research and development
and foreign direct investment, but also via illegal means
in the form of secret information theft.[32] The trend of
the national defense industry sector is directly linked to
the modernization of the military and should be closely
watched with grave attention.
China’s civil-military fusion policy has been evident
in the technology area. China promotes two-way
technological exchanges where military technologies are
utilized for developing the national economy while civilian
technologies are absorbed for national defense development.
It also seems interested in absorbing foreign technologies
available both for military and civilian purposes. It is
pointed out that China’s civil-military fusion policy gives


priority to initiatives in seas, outer space, cyber, AI, and
other emerging areas for China. The U.S. DoD has pointed
out that civil-military fusion includes six mutually related
efforts: (1) fusing China’s defense industrial base and its
civilian technology and industrial base, (2) integrating
and leveraging science and technology innovations across
military and civilian sectors, (3) cultivating talent and
blending military and civilian expertise and knowledge, (4)
building military requirements into civilian infrastructure
and leveraging civilian construction for military purposes,
(5) leveraging civilian service and logistics capabilities
for military purposes, and (6) expanding and deepening
China’s national defense mobilization system to include
all relevant aspects of its society and economy for use in
competition and war.[33][, ][34]
In addition, in recent years, China has reportedly
promoted the standardization of civilian products for their
military adoption from the production stage under the civilmilitary fusion policy. This initiative is expected to allow
the military to more effectively utilize civilian resources.
In regard to this point, the Xi Jinping administration
elevated civil-military fusion to a national strategy in
2015. At a meeting of the CCP Politburo in the following
year of 2016, the administration stated that elevating civilmilitary fusion to a national strategy was inevitable for
achieving the unification of a “rich country, strong army.”
Furthermore, China’s stance of placing importance on
civil-military fusion can be seen in its establishment in
2017 of the Central Commission for Military-Civil Fusion
Development, chaired by Xi, and the amendment of the
Party constitution to specify a “military-civilian integration
strategy.” As the growth rate of national defense budget
has slowed in recent years, the civil-military fusion policy
is expected to become increasingly important for China,
which must balance building its defense and its economy.
In addition, in order to realize the aforementioned
“intelligentized warfare” advocated by China, it is key to
acquire advanced civilian technologies, including so-called
game changing technologies, that would dramatically
change future warfare. Therefore, because China’s civilmilitary fusion policy is seen as an indispensable means
to achieve this, this policy, including its relationship to
“intelligentized warfare,” must continue to be monitored

China, some question China’s initial response and delay in

**1 General Situation**


China, particularly regarding maritime issues over which
its interests conflict with others’, continues to demonstrate
its attitude of realizing its unilateral assertions without
compromise, while promoting assertive actions including
those to change the status quo by coercion and create a
fait accompli for such changes, based on its own assertions
incompatible with the existing international order. China
has been promoting its BRI as a national strategy, but
some BRI-participating countries have recently been
reconsidering BRI projects due mainly to their fiscal
deterioration. Furthermore, it has been pointed that there
have been moves toward creating China’s own international
order, including the establishment of China-led multilateral
mechanisms in security, financial to influence political
decisions in other countries through efforts such as winning
over foreign politicians.[35]

At the same time, China recognizes that a peaceful
and stable international environment is necessary for
maintaining sustainable economic development and
enhancing China’s overall national power. Based on such
recognition, China has advocated building a “community
of shared future for mankind” and referred to promoting
the building of “a new type of international relations
based on mutual respect, equity and justice, and winwin cooperation.” China proactively carries out military
exchanges with other countries. In recent years, China
has been engaged in active military exchanges not only
with major powers such as the United States and Russia
and with its neighboring countries including Southeast
Asian countries, but also with countries in Africa and
Latin America. The objectives of China’s promotion of
military exchanges are thought to include alleviating other
countries’ concerns regarding China by strengthening its
relations with these countries, creating a favorable security
environment for China, enhancing China’s influence in the
international community, exploring overseas arms markets,
securing stable supplies of natural resources, and ensuring
foreign bases.
With regard to the COVID-19 infections that emerged in


China, some question China’s initial response and delay in
providing relevant information. In this situation, there are also
views that China is aiming to increase political and economic
interest in its own country, while strategically working to
form an international and regional order that is advantageous
to China and expand its influence by leveraging support for
the COVID-19 infection countermeasures such as so-called
“mask diplomacy” and “vaccine diplomacy.” Furthermore,
in June 2021, China jointly proposed the Initiative for Belt
and Road Partnership on COVID-19 Vaccines Cooperation
with 28 countries, including ASEAN and Central Asian
countries, thus attempting to take the lead in multilateral
vaccine-related plans.

**2 Relations with Russia**

Ever since the so-called China-Soviet confrontation ended
in 1989, China and Russia have placed importance on their
bilateral relationship. They have emphasized the deepening
of their “strategic partnership” since its establishment in
the mid-1990s. In 2001, the China-Russia Treaty of GoodNeighborliness and Friendly Cooperation was concluded.
In 2004, the long-standing issue of border demarcation
between the two countries came to a settlement. The
two countries have a common view on promoting the
multipolarization of the world and the establishment of a
new international order, and have further deepened their
relations. At the China-Russia summit meeting in early
February 2022, the two countries assessed China-Russia
relations as “superior to political and military alliances
of the Cold War era.” Furthermore, for example, amid
growing tensions in U.S.-China and U.S.-Russia relations,
China and Russia have consistently deepened their
cooperation. Each country is believed to be planning to
create an international environment favorable to itself by
taking a united stance on security issues, such as Taiwan
and issues surrounding NATO’s eastern expansion, which
are in conflict with the United States and others.
Specifically, in the joint statement released after the
aforementioned China-Russia summit meeting, the two
sides showed mutual understanding and support on


**Chapter**
**3**


-----

various points. They affirmed their opposition to Taiwan
independence and further NATO expansion, concern over
the establishment of AUKUS, and calls for the withdrawal
of the U.S. plan to deploy shorter- and intermediate-range
ground-based missiles in the Asia-Pacific region and in
Europe. Furthermore, China and Russia confirmed that
“there are no ‘forbidden’ areas of cooperation” between
the two countries and that they would continue to maintain
high-level mutual visits in a close manner, effectively deal
with external interference and regional security threats,
and defend global strategic stability. They also emphasized
that they would conduct coordination and cooperation, and
the need to fulfill responsibilities of major powers.
Since Russia began its aggression against Ukraine
on February 24, 2022, China has taken the position that
it is not concerned with Russia’s plans for aggression.
However, China does not blame Russia, and insists that
Russia’s actions are caused by the “Cold War mentality” of
the NATO member countries including the United States,
and that it understands Russia’s reasonable concerns on
security issues. Furthermore, China emphasizes that both
China and Russia have made it clear that the so-called
“provision of military assistance to Russia by the Chinese
side” is complete disinformation.
On the military front, since the 1990s, China has
purchased modern weapons from Russia, including fighters,
destroyers, and submarines. Russia is currently the largest
supplier of weapons to China.[36] Although China-Russia
arms transactions in value in recent years have been lower
than in some past period, China has apparently continued to
indicate its strong interests in importing advanced Russian
defense equipment and in joint equipment development
with Russia. For example, China has introduced what are
believed to be the latest fourth generation Su-35 fighters
and the S-400 surface-to-air missile system from Russia.
China has been reported as the first country to import the
Russian S-400 missile system. It is also suggested that
Russia has concerns about competing with China in arms
exports taking into consideration China’s improvement of
technological power.
Military exchanges between China and Russia take
place in such forms as routine mutual visits by senior
military officers and bilateral and multilateral exercises.
For example, China participated in the Vostok 2018
exercise, viewed as one of the largest Russian military

36 According to “Arms Transfers Database,” SIPRI.


exercises since the end of the Cold War, the Tsentr-2019
exercise in 2019, Maneuvers “Kavkaz 2020” in 2020, and
Zapad/Interaction-2021 in 2021. Additionally, the two
countries have held the large-scale bilateral naval exercise
“Joint Sea” since 2012. The annual exercise for 2016 took
place in the South China Sea for the first time, and that for
2017 was held in the Baltic Sea and Sea of Okhotsk for the
first time. In October 2021, a group of vessels, including a
Renhai-class destroyer, participated in the exercise, which
was conducted in the Sea of Japan. Furthermore, China
and Russia continued this by conducting their first joint
navigation around Japan by a total of 10 vessels from both
countries. In 2016 and 2017, the two countries held the
“Aerospace Security” missile defense computer-simulated
exercise. Furthermore, China has held the counterterrorism
joint exercise “Peace Mission” between China and
Russia or among the member countries of the Shanghai
Cooperation Organization (SCO), established in June 2001
including Russia. China likely regards these exchanges
as an opportunity to learn about how to operate Russianmade weapons and the operational doctrine of the Russian
Armed Forces, which have combat experiences.
In addition, moves indicating deepened China-Russia
relations have been confirmed in recent years. In the two
countries’ “first joint strategic flight” of bombers in July
2019, their bombers joined in the Sea of Japan and flew to
the East China Sea. In September 2019, China and Russia
signed a series of documents on cooperation in the military
and military technologies.[37] Similar trends continued in
2020. In December that year, Russian Defense Minister
Sergey Shoigu and Chinese Defense Minister Wei Fenghe
held a video teleconference and signed a protocol on the
extension of the intergovernmental agreement on mutual
notifications of ballistic missile and carrier rocket launches
for 10 years. In the same month, Russian and Chinese
bombers conducted a long-distance joint flight from the
Sea of Japan to the East China Sea and the Pacific Ocean.
Bombers from both countries also conducted a longdistance joint flight in November 2021. Comparing the
previous two joint flights by Chinese and Russian aircraft,
diversification of the flight pattern was seen in 2021,
including that it was conceivable that the aircraft mutually
passed through Chinese and Russian airspace and then
advanced to the Sea of Japan before reaching the vicinity
of Japan. Bombers from both countries further conducted


**Chapter**
**3**


-----

another long-distance joint flight in May 2022 amidst the
Russia’s aggression against Ukraine, flying farther out into
the Pacific Ocean than ever before. There is a possibility
that China and Russia will conduct such joint activities on
a regular basis in the future, including the aforementioned
joint navigation around Japan by Chinese and Russian
vessels in October 2021, and further deepen their military
cooperation. In addition, both countries have announced
that continuing on from 2020, the purpose of the joint
flights was to deepen and develop the comprehensive
partnership relations in the new era.
These developments, including the strengthening
of military cooperation between China and Russia, not
only have a direct impact on the security environment
surrounding Japan, but may also have strategic effects on
the United States and Europe, and should be watched with
concern.

**3 Relations with North Korea**

China has kept close relations with North Korea under
the 1961 Sino-North Korean Mutual Aid and Cooperation
Friendship Treaty. In June 2019, President Xi Jinping
became the first Chinese president to visit North Korea in
14 years, and held his fifth summit meeting with Chairman
Kim Jong-un. In July 2021, President Xi and Chairman
Kim Jong-un exchanged congratulatory messages on the
occasion of the 60th anniversary of the Sino-North Korean
Mutual Aid and Cooperation Friendship Treaty. Both sides
confirmed the significance of the treaty as “friendship forged
in blood” and expressed their desire to further strengthen
relations. In September of the same year, President Xi
Jinping sent a congratulatory message to Chairman Kim
Jong-un on the 73rd anniversary of the founding of North
Korea. In the message, President Xi expressed that he
attached great importance to the development of ChinaNorth Korea relations. He also stated that he was willing
to work with Chairman Kim to develop the friendly and
cooperative relations between the “two countries” in
a long-term and steady manner for constant and new
achievements, so as to better benefit the two countries and
their people. President Xi also expressed his intention to
maintain close relations even amidst COVID-19.
China has reportedly adopted three principles on the
Korea Peninsula - (1) the denuclearization of the Korean
Peninsula, (2) the maintenance of peace and stability on
the Korean Peninsula, and (3) the resolution of problems
through dialogue and consultations indicating that China


gives priority to the maintenance of stability and dialogue
as well as the denuclearization. Under these principles,
China, while agreeing to UN Security Council resolutions
to enhance sanctions on North Korea, cooperated with
Russia in distributing a draft resolution including a proposal
to lift some of the UN sanctions at the council.
Although China has vowed to have seriously observed
its international obligations, it has been pointed out that
Chinese ships have been involved in illicit ship-to-ship
transfer prohibited by the UN Security Council resolutions.

**4 Relations with Other Countries**

**(1) Relations with Southeast Asian Countries**
As for its relations with countries in Southeast Asia,
reciprocal summit-level visits and other activities continue
to be actively carried out. China is also actively involved in
multilateral frameworks such as ASEAN Plus One (China),
ASEAN Plus Three (Japan, China and the ROK), East Asia
Summit (EAS) and ASEAN Regional Forum (ARF). At the
ASEAN-China Special Summit in November 2021, there
was an announcement on the elevation to the ASEAN-China
Comprehensive Strategic Partnership. Furthermore, China
has developed bilateral relations through infrastructure
development support, etc., under the BRI.
On the military front, there seems to be moves that
China has made efforts toward military confidence
building, such as the first ASEAN-China Maritime Field
Training Exercise, which took place in October 2018. In
July 2019, it was reported that a secret deal on China’s
exclusive use of part of Cambodia’s Ream Naval Base had
been signed between the two countries. Concerning this
matter, the Cambodian side denied the existence of such
a fact, saying that hosting foreign military bases is against
its Constitution. In addition, in June 2021, Cambodia’s
Minister of National Defense acknowledged that China had
contributed to the development of the Ream Naval Base,
which the United States is considered to have concerns
about in regard to its military use by China. However, he
stated that access to the base facilities was not limited to
China alone.
In July 2016, an arbitration award based on the United
Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea (UNCLOS)
adjudicating the Philippines’ case against China in the
South China Sea was rendered, accepting most of the
Philippine claims. After that, the Philippines was said to
have refrained from referring to the arbitration award.
In September 2019 however a Philippine Presidential


**Chapter**
**3**


-----

Office spokesperson noted that the arbitration award was
still a subject in bilateral talks, and in September 2020,
President Rodrigo Duterte remarked at the United Nations
General Assembly that, “The (Arbitral) Award is now
part of international law beyond compromise and beyond
the reach of passing governments to dilute, diminish, or
abandon.” In April 2019, the Philippines announced a
protest statement against China over massive Chinese
fishing boats confirmed as near Thitu Island under effective
Philippine control among the Spratly Islands. Furthermore,
the Government of the Philippines announced that it had
lodged a protest in April 2020 against China in relation to
an incident in which a Chinese ship irradiated a Filipino
ship in February 2020. In March 2021, approximately 220
maritime militia vessels were confirmed near Whitsun
Reef in the Spratly Islands. The Philippine government
expressed deep concern and demanded that the Chinese
government promptly withdraw the vessels. Furthermore,
in November 2021, the Philippine Foreign Minister issued
a statement of protest about obstruction of work caused by
the use of a water cannon by Chinese Coast Guard vessels
against supply vessels that were working to supply the
Philippine military in the Spratly Islands. In response, the
Chinese Ministry of Foreign Affairs justified the response
by claiming that the Philippine supply vessels had entered
Chinese waters without China’s approval, and stating that
the Chinese Coast Guard vessels were performing their
official duties in accordance with the law and protecting
Chinese territorial sovereignty.
In July 2017 and March 2018, the Vietnamese
government reportedly made foreign companies, engaged
in oil drilling in the South China Sea with the permission
of the Vietnamese government, cancel the drilling under
the pressure from China. Chinese and Vietnamese
government ships staged a standoff over oil and natural
gas drilling within Vietnam’s exclusive economic zone
from July 2019 until Vietnam withdrew its HAKURYU-5
drilling rig in October of that year to end the standoff. The
Government of Vietnam also announced in April 2020 that
it had protested the Chinese side concerning the incident
in which a China Coast Guard vessel rammed and sunk a
Vietnamese fishing boat near the Paracel Islands. On the
other hand, in December 2021, the joint medical exercise
“Peace Rescue 2021” was conducted for the first time
by the Chinese and Vietnamese militaries to improve the
medical support capabilities of both militaries. During the
exercise, the Chinese side provided the Vietnamese side
with medical masks protective clothing and PCR test


equipments.
Indonesia has had frequent disputes with China over
Chinese fishing boats’ operations within Indonesia’s
exclusive economic zone and taken strong actions against
foreign fishing boats engaging in alleged illegal operations.
Recently, the Indonesian government filed a strong
protest against Chinese fishing boats’ illegal operations
near Indonesia’s Natuna Islands from December 2019 to
January 2020, rejecting China’s assertion on the nine-dash
line anew.
China and ASEAN have continued talks to discuss
the formulation of the Code of Conduct of Parties in the
South China Sea (COC) and Chinese Premier Li Keqiang
announced in November 2018 that he hoped to complete
negotiations within three years. In July 2019, China
announced at the Chinese and ASEAN Foreign Ministers’
meeting that they had completed the first reading of
the Single Draft COC Negotiating Text. Subsequently,
a second reading was initiated. At the August 2021
ASEAN Foreign Ministers’ Meeting, it was noted that a
provisional agreement on the Preamble had been reached.
Despite the effects of COVID-19 and other factors, in the
Joint Statement of the ASEAN-China Special Summit in
November of that year, there was mention of expectations
for the early conclusion of an effective and substantive
COC in accordance with international law, including
UNCLOS.

**(2) Relations with Central Asian Countries**
The Xinjiang Uyghur Autonomous Region, located in the
western part of China, is situated next to Central Asia.
Therefore, China is deeply concerned about the political
stability and security situations, such as terrorism by
Islamic extremists, in Central Asian states. Such concerns
of China appear to be reflected in China’s tightened border
control and its engagement in the SCO and the stabilization
of Afghanistan. Moreover, China is strongly interested in
Central Asia, with a view to diversifying its supply sources
and procurement methods for resources. China promotes
cooperation in the energy field with Central Asian
countries, such as the construction of oil and natural gas
pipelines between China and Central Asian nations.

**(3) Relations with South Asian Countries**
China has a close relationship with Pakistan under their
“all-weather strategic partnership,” and mutual visits
by their summit leaders take place frequently. Their
cooperation in the military sector including bilateral


**Chapter**
**3**


-----

exercises, exporting weapons, and transferring military
technology, is also deepening. As the importance of sea
lanes increases for China, it is believed that the importance
of Pakistan is rising for China accordingly, partly because
of the geopolitical features of Pakistan which faces the
Indian Ocean. The China-Pakistan Economic Corridor
(CPEC), a China-supported development plan for power
facilities and transportation infrastructure in the region
stretching from the Port of Gwadar to Kashgar in the
Xinjiang Uyghur Autonomous Region, is a flagship project
of the BRI. While some have pointed out that the project
has run into difficulties, as indicated by delays and partial
withdrawals due to Pakistan’s deteriorating financial
situation and terrorist attacks by extremist groups on
CPEC-related projects, the project’s progress is expected
to further increase China’s influence in Pakistan.
Although economic ties between China and India are
strengthening, the two countries have not demarcated their
borders in areas such as Kashmir and Arunachal Pradesh.
In May 2020, a clash between Chinese and Indian forces
occurred near the China-India border in Ladakh, India, and
tensions between the two countries escalated with the first
deadly clash in 45 years on June 15 of the same year. Since
then, China and India have regularly held commander-level
meetings based on the management agreement for the Line
of Actual Control, a temporary border between the two
countries. They agreed to separate their forces at Pangong
Lake in February 2021 and in the Gogra area in July of
the same year. The countries are currently still continuing
efforts to gradually ease tensions.
Amidst this, China enacted its National Land Boundary
Law in October of the same year, which stipulates defense
of land borders as a military mission. The spokesperson of
the Indian Ministry of External Affairs stated that the ChinaIndia border issue had not been resolved, and that India
was concerned about China’s unilateral attempt to enact
legislation which could have implications on the countries’
existing bilateral arrangements on border management as
well as on the boundary issue. However, the spokesperson
of the Chinese Ministry of Foreign Affairs stated that
the main purpose of the law is to “strengthen boundary
management and advance international cooperation,” and
that China hopes that “relevant countries will abide by
norms of international relations and refrain from wanton
speculations on China’s normal domestic legislation.” In
addition, China has been observed to be building bridges


and unilaterally establishing location names in areas
disputed with India.
In recent years, China has also been deepening its
relations with Sri Lanka. To Sri Lanka, which is located
at a strategic point in the Indian Ocean and supports the
BRI, China has provided massive economic and technical
cooperation in infrastructure development, including for
railroads, ports, and airports. China also gave Sri Lanka a
Jiangwei-class frigate in July 2019. On the other hand, in
July 2017, an agreement was reached to lend interests for
99 years to Chinese enterprises at the Port of Hambantota,
which is being constructed with Chinese loans. Some
have noted that this constitutes what has been described
as a “debt trap.” In January 2022, President Rajapaksa met
with Foreign Minister Wang Yi and requested that the debt
repayment plan be reconsidered due to the economic crisis
caused by the spread of COVID-19 infections.
Additionally, China is deepening its relations with
Bangladesh through its port development in Chittagong
where a naval base is located, arms exports including
Ming-class submarines, and other deals.

**(4)** **Relations with European Countries**
For China, the European Union (EU) countries have
become an important partner especially in the economic
field.
European countries possess more advanced military
technologies than China or Russia regarding information
and communication technology, avionics/aeroengines, air
independence propulsion (AIP) systems for submarines,
and other areas. The EU countries have maintained their
arms embargo on China since the Tiananmen Square
incident in 1989, and China has requested them to lift the
embargo.[38] If the EU arms embargo on China were lifted,
sophisticated military technologies could be transferred
to China and to third countries via China, dramatically
changing the security environment in the Indo-Pacific and
other regions.
China’s recent rise has attracted attention from the NATO
as well. The Communiqué issued at the June 2021 NATO
summit conference stated, “China’s stated ambitions and
assertive behavior present systemic challenges to the rulesbased international order,” and expressed concern over
China’s rapid buildup of its nuclear capabilities, lack of
transparency, and use of disinformation. The Communiqué
also mentions engaging with China for the security interests


**Chapter**
**3**


-----

of the Alliance, and calls on China to act responsibly in the
international community.
China’s relations with European countries, including EU
discussions on the arms embargo on China and NATO’s
policy on engagement with China, should be continuously
watched.

**(5) Relations with Middle East and African**
**Countries, Pacific Island countries, and Central**
**and South American Countries**

China has been enhancing its relations with Middle
Eastern and African nations in the economic realm. In
recent years, it has also strengthened military relations
with them. Not only intensive interactions among state
leaders and senior military officials but also arms exports
and exchanges between military forces are actively
conducted. China also actively dispatches personnel
to undertake UN PKO in Africa. Some suspect that
underlying these movements could be China’s aim to
ensure a stable supply of natural resources and to secure
overseas bases in the future.
China is Australia’s biggest trade partner. However,
there has been economic friction between the two
countries such as China’s successive restriction on
importing Australian beef and other goods since
Australia suggested the necessity for an independent
investigation into the origin of COVID-19. China has
also been boosting its relations with Pacific island
countries by providing them with proactive and
continuous economic support and medical services
deploying a military hospital ship. China has promoted
resources development in Papua New Guinea and
signed an agreement with the island country on military
cooperation. China has also been moving to enhance
military relations with Vanuatu, Fiji, and Tonga. In
addition, when a volcanic eruption occurred in Tonga
in January 2022, China dispatched transport aircraft and
supply ships. While China has been enhancing relations
with Pacific island nations, Australia and some other
countries have expressed concerns about such Chinese
moves.
China has been striving to further deepen its relations
with Central and South American countries, holding
ministerial meetings with the Community of Latin
American and Caribbean States (CELAC) since 2015. In
the military field, China has dispatched senior officials
and sold arms to these countries and enhanced relations
with them in medical services counterterrorism and


other areas. In Argentina, China operates an outer space
observation facility.

**5 International Transfer of Weapons**

China has been expanding exports of weapons such
as small arms, tanks, aircraft including drones, and
ships. China’s major arms export destinations include
Pakistan, Bangladesh, and Myanmar. China has also
been reportedly exporting arms to Algeria, Tanzania,
Nigeria, Sudan, and other African countries, Venezuela
and other Latin American countries, Iran, Saudi Arabia,
and other Middle Eastern countries, and Turkmenistan,
Belarus, and other former Soviet Union countries.
Recently, Serbia has been reported likely to become
the first European country to introduce Chinese UAVs.
In addition, in December 2021, there were reports that
Saudi Arabia was manufacturing ballistic missiles with
Chinese technical support. Some claim that China
has transferred weapons to foreign countries in order
to strengthen its strategic relationships with friendly
nations, enhance its influence in the international
community, and secure natural resources. China has not
participated in some of the frameworks for international
arms export control, and some point out that missilerelated and other technologies have been transferred
from China to other countries.

with its own efforts with contribution to promoting
mediation and dialogue.
In regard to trade issues, the United States and
China have been countering each other through phased
raising of tariffs since 2018. In January 2020, however,
the United States and China reached the Phase 1 deal,
which places China’s expansion of import volumes from
the United States as a pillar, and the two countries also
reduced some additional tariffs. In October 2021, U.S.
Trade Representative Tai and Chinese Vice Premier
Liu He held an online meeting in which they reviewed
the implementation of the Phase 1 deal and agreed to
discuss unresolved issues.
Concerning sensitive technologies and critical
technologies, the United States is elevating a sense of
vigilance against China. In the Interim Guidance, the
United States positions economic security as part of
national security, and is devoting energy into the protection
and development of sensitive and critical technologies.
Under the recognition that the leakage of sensitive
technologies and critical technologies would increase
China’s military power and thus threaten U.S. security,
in 2018, the United States enacted the Export Control
Reform Act, which serves as the basis for regulations on
dual-use items for both military and civilian applications.
With the enactment of the Export Control Reform Act,
the United States also expanded the scope of regulations
on technologies including emerging one by establishing
new export control policies, including adding new areas
subject to regulation. Furthermore, the United States is
strengthening control of critical technologies, including
implementing a measures to place visa restrictions on
certain Chinese persons and add Chinese firms such as
Huawei to its Entity List, which restricts the export from
the United States for reasons, such as stealing American
trade secrets, involvement in human rights abuses,
and militarization activities in the South China Sea. In
addition, in June 2021, an executive order was issued
aimed at ensuring that U.S. investments do not support
Chinese military-industrial complex companies. The
Executive Order published Non-SDN Chinese MilitaryIndustrial Complex Companies List and prohibited the
purchase or sale of any publicly traded securities by a
United States person, which means any United States
citizen, lawful permanent resident, entity organized under
the laws of the United States and so on, for companies on
this list. In this way, the United States is further bolstering
its efforts to prevent the diversion of critical and sensitive


technologies of its own country, its allies, and others to
strengthen China’s military power.
Meanwhile, China, in its 2019 Defense White
Paper, states that “the US is engaging in technological
and institutional innovation in pursuit of absolute
military superiority.” At the same time, the report also
expresses the view that “the application of cuttingedge technologies such as artificial intelligence (AI) is
gathering pace in the military field,” and “International
military competition is undergoing historic changes.”
Furthermore, at the Fifth Plenary Session of the 19th
Central Committee of the Chinese Communist Party
in October 2020, China emphasized the importance
of recognizing self-reliance and self-strengthening
of science and technology as the strategic support to
the country’s development and stressed the necessity
to uphold the system and mechanism of science and
technology innovation. In response to the tightening
of regulations by the United States and other foreign
countries, China has been enforcing a series of
countermeasures, such as laws and regulations, since
2020. In September 2020, China implemented its
Unreliable Entity List in response to the U.S. Entity
List. In December of the same year, China’s Export
Control Law entered into force to control the export
of technology and the like related to China’s national
security and interests.
Furthermore, in January 2021, China passed new
rules to protect its firms from “unjustified extraterritorial application of foreign legislation and other
measures.” In addition to this, in June of the same year,
China announced the entry into force of the Anti-Foreign
Sanctions Law and implemented sanctions against U.S.
individuals and organizations, including the former U.S.
Secretary of Commerce, and is continuing deliberations
to apply the Law to Hong Kong as well.
Competition in the technology field between the
United States and China is likely to intensify further
in the future as both sides continue to reciprocate each
other’s efforts to set forth new regulations, and the effects
of which can be seen to be spreading internationally.
While China emphasizes its uncompromising stance
on the country’s core interests and significant concerns,
the United States also indicates an uncompromising
stance on its national security. Going forward, it is
deemed that the strategic competition between the
United States and China will become more prominent
in various fields

**1 General Situation**

talk was held, in which the two leaders discussed the
responsibilities of the United States and China to ensure
that the competition between the two countries does not
veer into conflict. During the telephone talk, President
Biden underscored the enduring interest of the United
States in the peace, stability, and prosperity of the IndoPacific region and the world. President Xi Jinping called
for cooperation in various areas of international issues,
such as climate change and economic recovery, while
also criticizing the United States’ tough stance toward
China. In addition, the National Defense Authorization
Act for FY2022, which was enacted in December of the
same year, placed importance on strategic competition
with China and Russia. It added new initiatives to
strengthen the posture and capabilities of U.S. forces
in the Indo-Pacific region, including the formulation
of a United States National Strategy with respect to
China and the implementation of an annual report on
Taiwan. In the Joint Statement of the Japan-U.S. “2+2”
Meeting in January 2022, the United States expressed
its determination to optimize its posture and capabilities
in the Indo-Pacific.
The DoD Annual Report to Congress 2021 pointed
out that China aims to displace U.S. alliances and
security partnerships in the Indo-Pacific region and
revise the international order to be more advantageous
to China’s authoritarian system and national interests.
In relation to the U.S.-Russia Intermediate-Range
Nuclear Forces (INF) Treaty, which came to an end in
August 2019, the United States demands the inclusion
of China into arms control negotiations, as China has
beefed up land-based conventional ballistic missile
capabilities outside the framework of the INF Treaty.
In addition, the United States expressed the same view
in the process of the extension negotiation of the New
START Treaty (Strategic Arms Reduction Treaty), of
which the extension was decided in February 2021,
clearly showing its intention to put a certain degree
of brake on China’s missile capability development.
However, China has been consistently refusing[5] to slow
down, claiming that the United States should lead the


**1 General Situation**

During the former Trump administration, the United
States indicated that the re-emergence of long-term
strategic competition from revisionist powers including
China was a central challenge to its prosperity and
security. With this as a backdrop, the United States
recognizes that China is pursuing regional hegemony
in the Indo-Pacific in the near future through the
modernization of its military and other efforts.[3] The
Biden administration is continuing to take the deterrence
stance against China. In February 2021, President Biden,
in his address on diplomatic policies, called China “the
most serious competitor” of the United States, and then
in his remarks to the Department of Defense in the same
month mentioned that the United States would need to
respond to the issues brought by China for defending its
interest in the Indo-Pacific and around the world.
Furthermore, in March 2021, the United States
released its Interim Guidance in which it describes China
as “the only competitor potentially capable of combining
its economic, diplomatic, military, and technological
power to mount a sustained challenge to a stable and open
international system.” At the congressional hearing held
in the same month, the Commander of the U.S. IndoPacific Command (USINDOPACOM) Phil Davidson
described the military balance in the Indo-Pacific as not
desirable to the United States and its allies, and pointed
out the growing risk of China seeking to change the
status quo in the region. He testified that China was
accelerating its ambitions for taking the U.S.’s leading
role in a rules-based global order, and that China’s
ambitions for Taiwan would become clear within the next
six years. In response to such a U.S. perception, China
expressed that it expects the United States to abandon
the outdated zero-sum thinking and take more rational
and practical policies towards China. In November of
the same year, at the Aspen Security Forum on national
security held by the United States, U.S. Chairman of
the Joint Chiefs of Staff Milley pointed out that the
coming 10 to 20 years will be a significant challenge
for national security because China’s aspiration is to
challenge the United States globally and to revise the

implementation of disarmament.
The United States has reiterated that the Article
5 of the Japan-U.S. Security Treaty applies to the
Senkaku Islands. This was confirmed in February
2017, in the joint statement from the first Japan-U.S.
summit meeting since the inauguration of the former
Trump administration, which explicitly referred to the
application of Article 5 of the Treaty to the Senkaku
Islands. The U.S. policy on this matter remains the
same and has been confirmed since the inauguration
of the Biden administration through summit telephone
talks, defense ministerial meetings, foreign ministerial
meetings, and the Joint Statement of the Japan-U.S.
“2+2” Meeting in January 2022. China has shown its
strong protest against these stances. With regard to the
issues over the South China Sea, the United States is
concerned about such dimensions as obstruction to the
freedom of navigation in sea lanes, restrictions on the
activities of U.S. Forces, and the worsening security
situation in the entire region. The United States has
requested China to comply with international norms,
and has repeatedly criticized China’s unilateral and
assertive actions. And the United States also implements
the Freedom of Navigation Operation in the South
China Sea and other waters to counter excessive claims
to maritime interests by other countries such as China
and calls for demilitarizing the South China Sea.
In this way, while China is rapidly strengthening
military power against the backdrop of its economic
development and other factors, changes in the military
power balance between the United States and China
can affect peace and stability of the Indo-Pacific. Thus,
the U.S.-China military trends in the region concerning
the South China Sea and Taiwan will require further
attention.

**2 South China Sea**

Since 2014, China implemented rapid and largescale land reclamation projects in the Spratly Islands.
Following the completion of the land reclamation
in 2015, even after the illegality of the Chinese
activities such as land reclamation was determined at
the Philippines-China arbitration in July 2016, China
has made it clear that it would not comply with the
decision and has been promoting its plan to militarize


the area. It has also been pointed out that if China were
to consider bastion operations (fortification) to enhance
the survivability of new types of long-range SLBMs
capable of targeting the U.S. mainland, the South China
Sea would be the preferred option.[6]

China has also been actively conducting military
activities in the South China Sea, including its
announcing a military exercises conducted with an
aircraft carrier in the South China Sea in May 2021 and
implementing a military training in a wide area of the
South China Sea, including off Hainan Island and the
Paracel Islands in August of the same year.
Moreover, China utilizes not only its military forces
but also the Coast Guard, which is a “maritime law
enforcement organization” in the Coast Guard law, and
so-called maritime militia to increase pressure on the
neighboring countries.
Furthermore, in April 2020, a Chinese Coast Guard
ship rammed and sunk a Vietnamese fishing boat near
the Paracel Islands, while in May 2020, a Coast Guard
ship interfered with Filipino fishermen’s operations.
In this way, there have been cases that interfered with
fishery activities of the neighboring countries in the
South China Sea. In February 2021, the China Coast
Guard Law, which stipulates the responsibility and
authority of the China Coast Guard including the use
of weapons, entered into force. This Law includes
problematic provisions in terms of their inconsistency
with international law. Sources of inconsistency
include, among others, ambiguity as to geographical
areas the Coast Guard Law applies and how the rules
governing the use weapons are implemented, and
neighboring countries started expressing concerns
about Chinese moves. The Philippines announced that
its Minister of Foreign Affairs had protested against the
CCG Law through a diplomatic route. Furthermore, in
Vietnam a foreign ministry spokesperson commented
that, “Vietnam requests relevant countries that they
respect Vietnam’s sovereignty, sovereign rights, and
jurisdiction in the South China Sea, responsibly and
faithfully enforce international laws and the United
Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea, and avoid
behavior that raises tension between countries.” In
addition, in March of the same year, the Philippine
government announced that it had confirmed
approximately 220 Chinese militia ships near Whitsun


**Chapter**

Reef and expressed concern. In November of the same
year, Philippine supply ships were blocked and watercannoned by Chinese Coast Guard vessels at the Second
Thomas Shoal which is under the effective control of
the Philippines, prompting the Philippine government
to lodge protest against China.[7] In addition, in June of
the same year, the Malaysian Air Force announced that
16 Chinese military aircraft had flown over the Luconia
Shoal and approached as far as the Malaysian coast. In
October of the same year, a Chinese research vessel and
other vessels entered Malaysia’s exclusive economic
zone, which the Malaysian government protested
against.
With regard to the issues over the South China Sea, the
United States has been criticizing China’s behavior and
implementing the Freedom of Navigation Operations.
Under the Biden administration following on from the
former Trump administration, the United States has
been demonstrating more severe stance against such
moves by China.
In July 2020, the United States released a U.S.
Secretary of State’s statement entitled “U.S. Position on
Maritime Claims in the South China Sea,” and accused
China of illegal maritime claims across most areas of
the South China Sea. In August of the same year, the
U.S. Department of State announced visa restrictions
on Chinese individuals as a sanction against China’s
militarization activities in the South China Sea. In this
announcement, a high-level official of the Department of
State mentioned that this sanction was only the beginning
of imposing many other means against China’s malign
activities in the South China Sea. On the same day, the
United States Department of Commerce announced that
it had added 24 Chinese firms to the Entity List for the
reasons that they had supported the PLA constructing
artificial islands and conducting militarizing activities
in the South China Sea. Since the inauguration of the
Biden administration, the United States has continued
to show its consistent deterrence stance against China.
For example, U.S. Secretary of State Blinken stated that
the United States would reject China’s claims about
maritime interests in the South China Sea, and stand up
together with Southeast Asian countries facing China’s
pressure. In July 2021, to mark the fifth anniversary
of the arbitration award between the Philippines and
China, Secretary Blinken issued a statement calling on


China to abide by its obligations under international
law, reiterating that any attack on Philippine forces in
the South China Sea would invoke U.S. mutual defense
commitments under the U.S.-Philippines Mutual
Defense Treaty. In August of the same year, the UN
Security Council held an online meeting on maritime
security, in which Secretary Blinken expressed concern
that the rule of law in the South China Sea was under
serious threat. However, China responded by saying that
the United States was the greatest threat to peace and
stability in the South China Sea, deepening the conflict.
Additionally, the United States has sought to enhance
military efforts in the South China Sea. It has frequently
conducted the Freedom of Navigation Operations,
carried out joint exercises in July 2020 by deploying
two Carrier Strike Groups for the first time since 2014,
and even after President Biden took office, in February
2021, once again conducted similar exercises several
times. The United States has also conducted bilateral
exercises with Japan, the United Kingdom, Australia,
the Netherlands, Canada, Singapore, and other partner
countries. Responding to these American efforts, China
has criticized the United States for hindering the peace
and stability of the region.
Going forward, while forming free and open order
based on the rule of law is important in the South
China Sea, the military tensions may rise. Japan, which
promotes the vision of a “Free and Open Indo-Pacific”
with the United States, will have to pay great attention
to the situation.

**3 Taiwan**

China upholds the principle that Taiwan is a part of
China and that the Taiwan issue is a domestic one.
China maintains that the “One China” principle is
the underlying premise and foundation for dialogue
between China and Taiwan. China has also strongly
opposed to any foreign intervention in the unification
of China as well as any move towards the independence
of Taiwan and has repeatedly stated that it has not
renounced the use of force. “The Anti-Secession Law,”
enacted in March 2005, clearly lays out China’s policy
of not renouncing the use of force, providing that in
the event that possibilities for a peaceful reunification
should be completely exhausted, the state shall employ

Recent international affairs over Taiwan


China and Taiwan have continued to confront each other across the

Column

Taiwan Strait since the government of the Chinese Nationalist Party,
or Kuomintang (KMT), retreated to Taiwan in 1949. While military
tensions, known as Taiwan Strait Crises, have been heightened
several times between China and Taiwan until present, these
tensions have not resulted in an all-out armed clash. However, after
the Tsai Ing-wen administration led by the Democratic Progressive
Party (DPP), which is said to aspire to building an equal relationship
with China, was inaugurated in Taiwan in 2016, China took its efforts
a step further to increase pressure on Taiwan in a myriad of ways.
Regarding China-Taiwan relations, it can be said that tensions are
now rising between the Xi Jinping leadership, which is demonstrating
its willingness to use military force in achieving Taiwanese
unification, and its opposition: the Tsai Ing-wen administration and
the United States, which supports Taiwan in accordance with the
Taiwan Relations Act (TRA) and similar.
Amid the increasing tensions surrounding Taiwan, not only
the United States but also the international community, especially
European countries, have expressed its interest and concern in
respect of the peace and stability of the Taiwan Strait again and
again, and some have even demonstrated an active involvement in
the issues over Taiwan. For example, in the European Union (EU), the
European Parliament adopted a document related to strengthening
its relationship with Taiwan in October 2021. A delegation of
European Parliament members also visited Taiwan in November of
the same year and reportedly discussed cooperating in measures
against disinformation. In addition, Lithuania, one of the Baltic
states, made a statement in August 2021 that it would pursue
mutually beneficial ties with Taiwan in accordance with the principle
of “One China.” Lithuania also granted permission for establishing
the Taiwanese Representative Office, a local government branch
bearing the word “Taiwan,” in November of the same year, showing
its intention to place importance on its relations with Taiwan. From
a security perspective, U.K., Canadian, and U.S. warships passed
through the Taiwan Strait in 2021, and in November that year, the
Australian Defense Minister stated that it would be inconceivable for
Australia not to join the United States should Washington take action
to defend Taiwan.
In response to these developments, China has shown strong
opposition from both its rhetoric and military activities. In June
2021, a spokesperson for China’s Ministry of Foreign Affairs strongly
opposed the G7 Summit Leaders’ Declaration, which emphasized the
importance of peace and stability on the Taiwan Strait, claiming that
administrative affairs concerning Taiwan are domestic matters fully
under the purview of China, and that interference from any outside


forces would not be accepted. In addition, with regard to Lithuania
setting up the Taiwanese Representative Office, the Foreign Minister
of China expressed China’s position of firm opposition to any acts
involving “Two Chinas” or “One China, One Taiwan.” Furthermore,
according to announcements by Taiwan’s Ministry of National
Defense, Chinese military aircraft have frequently been entering
airspace southwest of Taiwan since September 2020, and a total of
approximately 970 Chinese aircraft entered this airspace in 2021,
which is more than double the number in 2020. Chinese media has
declared that one of the purposes of these flights was to resolutely
strike back against frequent provocations by external forces. In
addition, China has disclosed that it has carried out aircraft landing
training in Fujian Province, which faces Taiwan across the Taiwan
Strait. The country has also been increasing military pressure on
Taiwan, announcing in August 2021 that the Eastern Theater had
carried out field training including joint fire assault in waters and
airspaces around the areas southeast and southwest of the main
island of Taiwan.
Taiwan is an incredibly vital partner and an important friend
to Japan. It shares with us the fundamental values of freedom,
democracy, basic human rights, and the rule of law. Located in close
proximity to Japan’s Nansei Islands in the south, Taiwan lies merely
110 kilometers or so from the island of Yonaguni at the westernmost
tip of Japan. In addition, Taiwan is located at the point where the
South China Sea, the Bashi Channel, and the East China Sea meet,
and opens out on an important sea lane for Japan. Therefore,
stabilizing the situation surrounding Taiwan is important not only
for Japan’s security, but also for the stability of the international
community. Japan has always taken the unwavering position that
it hopes the issues over Taiwan will be settled peacefully through
dialogue. We must continue to pay close attention to any relevant
trends closely.

the Japan-U.S. summit meetings, the G7 Summit, and
the U.S.-EU summit meetings. Furthermore, the Biden
administration has been promoting efforts to enhance
Taiwan’s international standing, including calling on
UN member states to support Taiwan’s meaningful
participation in the UN system.
In addition, the U.S. has decided to implement
arms sales to Taiwan under the Taiwan Relations
Act. Arms sales took place 11 times under the Trump
administration, and the Biden administration has
continued its involvement, with the first arms sale taking
place in August 2021. In 2019, the president notified
Congress of its plan to sell such weapons as 66 F-16V
fighters to Taiwan, the first U.S. fighter sales to Taiwan
in the 27 years since 1992. From October to November
2020, the United States also notified Congress in
swift succession of the plan to sell the High Mobility
Artillery Rocket System (HIMARS), long range airto-surface missiles, and surface-to-ship missiles. The
National Defense Authorization Act for FY2022, which
was passed in December 2021, also clearly states that
the United States will continue to provide defense
equipment to Taiwan. In addition, the United States has
frequently sent its vessels to pass through the Taiwan
Strait under the Biden administration as well. Moreover,
in an interview with the U.S. media in October 2021,
President Tsai Ing-wen acknowledged that U.S. military
was visiting Taiwan for training purposes.
With regard to the United States, not only the
government but also Congress has indicated its
intention to further enhance support for Taiwan. The
Asia Reassurance Initiative Act, passed in December
2018, stipulates regular transfers of defense articles
to Taiwan and encouragement of the travel of highlevel U.S. officials to Taiwan. Similarly, the Taiwan
Allies International Protection and Enhancement
Initiative (TAIPEI) Act, enacted in March 2020,
stipulates the promotion of regular transfers of defense
articles to Taiwan. The TAIPEI Act also includes the
encouragement for the U.S. government to provide
support for “altering its economic, security, and
diplomatic engagement with nations that take serious or
significant actions to undermine the security or prosperity
of Taiwan” and for advocating Taiwan’s participation
and membership in international organizations. In June
and November 2021, and in March and April 2022,
U.S. congressional delegations visited Taiwan, met
with President Tsai and others and exchanged views on

nonpeaceful means and other necessary measures to
protect China’s sovereignty and territorial integrity.
On the other hand, conventionally, the United
States has been promoting its policy on Taiwan based
on the Taiwan Relations Act, the U.S.-China Joint
Communique, and six assurances, and does not intend
to change its approach to the “One China” principle.
However, since the former Trump administration, the
U.S. government has been expressing the stance to
deepening its involvement in the situation surrounding
Taiwan. In the Indo-Pacific Strategy Report (IPSR) of
the U.S. Department of Defense released in June 2019,
the intention of the United States to pursue a strong
partnership with Taiwan is mentioned. The United
States, in the U.S. Strategic Framework for the IndoPacific, which was released by the White House in
January 2021, states that it enables “Taiwan to develop
an effective asymmetric defense strategy,” while also
aiming for the United States to be capable of “defending
the first-island-chain nations, including Taiwan.” In
addition, in April of the same year, the United States
issued “New Guidelines” on promoting interactions
with Taiwanese authorities, indicating its stance on
continuing to promote U.S. engagement with Taiwan
even after the Biden administration.
The Biden administration has positioned China as
“the most serious competitor” challenging U.S.
prosperity, security, and democratic values, and has
made clear its diplomatic stance to contain China
through cooperation with allies and partner countries
on issues concerning Taiwan and other matters. For
example, since the Biden administration, the importance
of “peace and stability across the Taiwan Strait” has been
repeatedly mentioned at international meetings such as

strengthening U.S.-Taiwan relations and other matters.
Furthermore, the National Defense Authorization
Act for FY2022, passed by the U.S. Congress in
December of the same year, clearly stated a stance of
strengthening U.S. support for maintaining Taiwan’s
self-defense capabilities, and included an invitation to
Taiwan to participate in the 2022 RIMPAC and support
for improvement of Taiwan’s asymmetric military
capabilities.
In response, China has further increased its military
activities in the vicinity of Taiwan. In particular,
according to Taiwan’s Ministry of National Defense,
there has been an increase in Chinese military
aircraft entering Taiwan’s southwest airspace since


conducted an operations drills, including joint livefire drills, in the sea and airspace surrounding the
southwest and southeast of Taiwan Island, explaining
that the purpose of the drills was “solemn response to
the interference of foreign forces and the provocation
of ‘Taiwan independence’ secessionists.” It has been
pointed out that this was an activity to contain the
United States and Taiwan in conjunction with the
announcement date of the “August 17 Communiqué,”[8]
which was agreed upon between the United States and
China in 1982.
In this way, in recent years, cases have emerged
in which the Chinese side sends a message that it is
conducting landing and power projection exercises in the


September 2020. According to announcements by sea and airspace around Taiwan as a form of containing
Taiwan’s Ministry of National Defense, a total of Taiwan and the international community. Due to these **Chapter**

has been diversifying its assets entering this airspace by in the same way as the former Trump administration,

**1 Relations with China**

In response, China has criticized the Democratic

Taiwanese President Tsai Ing-wen from the Democratic Progressive Party for destroying the political foundation
Progressive Party, who took office in 2016, has noted of the peaceful development of cross-Strait relations by
that she has never accepted the “1992 Consensus” that rejecting the “1992 Consensus” unilaterally, emphasizing

that the United States recognized the Government of the People’s Republic of China as the sole legal government of China and acknowledged China’s position that Taiwan is part of China.

9 The “1992 Consensus” refers to what represents a common understanding reached between Chinese and Taiwanese authorities in 1992 on the “One-China” principle. The CCP and Taiwan’s
Kuomintang Nationalist Party (Taiwan’s ruling party at the time), viewed as parties to the consensus, have reportedly differed over the interpretation of the consensus. In addition, Taiwan’s

that the maintenance of the 1992 Consensus would
be the unshakable foundation for peace and stability of
cross-Strait relations.
In a January 2019 speech at an event commemorating
the 40th anniversary of China’s “Message to Compatriots
in Taiwan,” General Secretary Xi Jinping advocated a
five-point proposal for managing relations with Taiwan,
stating “the specific form of the ‘one country, two
systems’ model in Taiwan will give full consideration
to the situation in Taiwan.” In her immediate response
to the speech, President Tsai issued a statement firmly
rejecting the “one country, two systems” model and
called for negotiations between “government-authorized
agencies.” After winning re-election with the highest
ever number of votes in a Taiwanese presidential
election in January 2020, President Tsai told a press
conference the election results represented the value of
Taiwanese people and rejected the “one country, two
systems” model. In a manner to check the Taiwanese
side, China noted that regardless of how the Taiwanese
situation changed, there would be no change to the
basic fact that there is only one China in the world, with
Taiwan being a part of China. In October 2021, at the
ceremony commemorating the 110th anniversary of the
Xinhai Revolution, President Xi again sought to check
the Tsai administration, stating, “National reunification
by peaceful means best serves the interests of the
Chinese nation as a whole,” and “Those who… seek to
split the country will come to no good end; they will be
disdained by the people and condemned by history.” By
contrast, in her speech for the Double Tenth National
Day Celebration commemorating the Xinhai Revolution
that month, President Tsai said, “We call for maintaining
the status quo, and we will do our utmost to prevent
the status quo from being unilaterally altered,” stating
that “the Republic of China and the People’s Republic
of China should not be subordinate to each other,” and
emphasized the stance that cross-strait conflicts should
be resolved through dialogue between the two sides on
equal footing.
In regard to relations between the international
community and Taiwan, since around the inauguration of
President Tsai for her first term, Taiwanese delegates were
refused attendance at or had their invitations deferred
from meetings held by international organizations,
including ones in which they had participated up to


that point. As Nicaragua severed diplomatic relations
with Taiwan and established such relations with China
in December 2021, the number of countries having
diplomatic relations with Taiwan declined to 14 from 22
in May 2016, when President Tsai took office. Taiwan
is strongly protesting these actions, claiming them to be
“actions taken by China that compress the international
space of Taiwan.”

**2 Taiwan’s Military Power and Defense**
**Strategy**

With regard to Taiwan’s military power, at present,
ground forces, including the Navy Marine Corps, have
a total of approximately 104,000 personnel. In regard to
the organization of the army, it is planned to abolish the
traditional Army Corps and reorganize them into the first
to fifth Theaters of Operations. The Taiwanese Minister
of National Defense explained the reason for this as
being advantageous for the execution of joint operations
during conflict or peacetime. In addition, it is assessed
that approximately 1.66 million reserve personnel of
the air, naval, and ground forces would be available
in case of war. In January 2022, the All-out Defense
Mobilization Agency was established to integrate the
reserve forces and public and private organizations
involved in wartime mobilization to optimize the
efficiency of the mobilization system in the event of an
emergency. Regarding naval capabilities, in addition to
Kidd-class destroyers which were imported from the
United States, Taiwan possesses the indigenously built
“Tuo Chiang” stealth corvette, among other vessels.
Taiwan is currently promoting a national shipbuilding
program to independently build its own military vessels,
which includes plans to build 11 “Tuo Chiang”-class
corvettes by 2026 and about eight indigenously built
submarines by around 2023. Regarding air capabilities,
Taiwan possesses F-16 fighters (A/B and F-16V
upgraded from A/B), Mirage 2000 fighters, Ching-kuo
fighters, and other assets. In November 2021, Taiwan’s
first unit composed of F-16V fighters modified from
F-16A/B fighters was established at Chiayi Air Base,
and the deployment of fighters capable of carrying
longer-range missiles is being strengthened, including
the new F-16V fighters scheduled to be introduced from
the United States in 2022.

Taiwan adopted conscription in 1951, but it has been
switching to a volunteer system mainly to improve the
expertise of its military personnel, and the last of the
conscripts were enlisted by the end of 2018. However,
the obligation to undergo four months of military
training is being maintained and Taiwan’s Ministry of
Defense describes the Taiwanese system of military
service as a dual-track mix of conscripts and volunteers.
Since China has consistently expressed its intention
of not renouncing the use of force to Taiwan, the
country may make a decision on military options such
as air and maritime blockade, limited use of force,
air and missile operations, and invasion of Taiwan.
If that happens, it is deemed that China will deter or
delay any potential U.S. interventions. According to
Taiwan’s analysis of the Chinese invasion process for
Taiwan, in the initial phase, China will assemble its
military forces on the Chinese coast under the guise of
exercises and use “cognitive warfare” to cause panic
among the Taiwanese people. China will then gather its
naval vessels in the western Pacific to prevent foreign
military intervention. In the second phase, under the
strategy of transformation from exercises to war, the
Rocket and Air Forces will launch ballistic and cruise
missiles to attack Taiwan’s key military facilities, while
the Strategic Support Force carry out cyber attacks on
Taiwan’s key military systems. In the third phase, after
gaining sea and air superiority, landing operations by
amphibious assault ships, transport helicopters, and
more will be carried out, thus achieving total control of
Taiwan before foreign forces intervene.
In response to such developments by China, under
President Tsai, Taiwan has formulated a defense
strategy to prevent an invasion by China at the furthest
distance possible through a multilayered defense posture
combining major equipment such as fighter aircraft and
naval vessels with asymmetric capabilities, known as
“resolute defense and multi-domain deterrence.” The
strategy raises a defense concept comprising “force
protection” to contain the initial destruction caused
by the enemy and ensure integrity of military power
through mobility, concealment, dispersion, deception,
camouflage, and other tactics, “decisive battle in
littoral zone” to gain a partial superiority within the
coverage of their air assets and shore-based firepower


and employ integrated capabilities of three services
to destroy enemies’ vessels at sea, and “destruction
of enemy at landing beach” to destruct the enemy at
berthing, landing beach, and coastal areas by integrating
forces, firepower, and prepositioned barriers of three
services, and give them no places to set foot on.[11] This
is believed to be aimed at exhausting the operational
capabilities of the Chinese military and preventing or
reducing the landing of Chinese troops in the face of
the overwhelming gap in military strength between
China and Taiwan, as well as delaying an invasion by
the Chinese military and buying time until intervention
by the U.S. military. It is believed that Taiwan plans to
constrain any Chinese military invasion from a long
distance by expanding the development and production
of domestically produced asymmetric capabilities
and long-range weapons, as well as introducing highperformance, long-range weapons from the United
States, in order to successfully execute “resolute
defense and multi-domain deterrence.” Taiwan is
currently strengthening its domestic development of sea
and air capabilities, long-range missiles, and the like. In
November 2021, a special budget bill for the expansion
of sea and air capabilities was passed, and it was decided
to invest 240 billion Taiwan dollars (approximately 950
billion yen) over five years for the acquisition of selfdeveloped equipment. It has been pointed out that the
domestically-produced equipment that Taiwan aims
to strengthen includes the “Tuo Chiang”-class stealth
corvette which is known as the “carrier killer,” the
“Chien Hsiang” anti-radar drone, and the “Hsiung Feng
2ER” long-range surface-to-surface missile. In addition
to these, Taiwan has decided to acquire from the United
States the “M142” (HIMARS) high mobility artillery
rocket system, the “RGM-84L-4” (Harpoon) surface-toship missile system, and the “AGM-84H” (SLAM-ER)
long-range air-to-surface missile.
In March 2021, Taiwan released the Quadrennial
Defense Review (QDR), which is the fourth review since
2009. This report aims to present the national defense
strategy and military power development policy for the
next four years to contribute to strengthening the national
defense. In the report, Taiwan assesses China’s military
threat and states that China is improving operational
capabilities through landing exercises assuming an


11 Note that the 2021 Quadrennial Defense Review (QDR) and the National Defense Report present the concept of force application, “denial operations: hostile embarking phase; striking operations:
hostile seafaring phase; attacking operations: hostile disembarking phase, and total annihilation operations: hostile landing phase,” it will inflict multi-domain interception blows and joint firepower

invasion of Taiwan and the implementation of grayzone strategies, while maintaining capabilities for the
blockade of waters around the Taiwan Strait and AntiAccess/Area-Denial (A2/AD). Based on the evaluation,
Taiwan intends to enhance its defense capabilities by
enhancing long-range weapons and asymmetric forces
and developing surveillance capabilities, while Taiwan
utilizes new technologies such as big data analysis,
and cooperates with the Navy and the Coast Guard
Administration in order to deal with China’s gray-zone
situations.
In November 2021, a national defense report (the
National Defense Report 2021) was released for the
third time under the Tsai administration, presenting
to the people the defense policy initiatives of the past
two years. While maintaining the defense strategy of
“resolute defense and multi-domain deterrence,” the
report continued on from the QDR to indicate China’s
strong wariness of China’s gray zone tactics, including
a new section on China’s gray zone threats. The report
recognizes China’s gray zone tactics as a means of
“seizing Taiwan without a fight.” Specific examples
raised of China’s gray zone tactics include cyber attacks
through information gathering, attacks on infrastructure
and systems, and other means, and “cognitive warfare”
to create disorder in Taiwan’s society by manipulating
and disturbing the public’s mentality through the
development of the “Three Warfares” (psychological
warfare, public opinion warfare, and legal warfare) and
disseminating disinformation via social media and other
such means. In response to these threats from China,
Taiwan has expanded its asymmetric capabilities and
domestically produced weapons, purchased weapons
from the United States, strengthened integrated training,
enhanced cyber operations capabilities, enhanced
literacy education on Chinese cognitive warfare, and
strengthened its mobilization system through the
establishment of the “All-out Defense Mobilization
Agency.”
In addition to this, Taiwan annually conducts the “Han
Kuang” large-scale military exercise that simulates an
invasion by Chinese forces. It is believed that the Taiwan
military’s defense strategy is verified through this series
of drills. In the “Han Kuang” exercises in recent years,
in addition to anti-landing and interception programs,
drills are conducted with an awareness of anti-gray
zone tactics, such as anti-cyber warfare and joint drills
between the Navy and the Coast Guard Administration


The Han Kuang 37 exercise in 2021 is believed to
have included anti-landing drills on the Kinmen Islands,
Matsu Islands, and Penghu Islands simultaneously, as
well as the deployment of a new type of surface-to-ship
missile unit to eastern Taiwan to practice countering a
Chinese military invasion from eastern Taiwan.

**3 Military Balance between China and**
**Taiwan**

While China has continued to increase its defense
budget by a significant margin, Taiwan’s defense
budget, at approximately 367.6 billion Taiwan dollars
for FY2022, has remained almost unchanged for nearly
20 years. China’s announced military budget in the
same year totals approximately 1,450.4 billion yuan,
roughly 17 times the amount of Taiwan’s in terms of
U.S. dollars based on exchange rates announced by the
Taiwanese Central Bank. It is pointed out that China’s
actual defense expenditure has been larger than the
published defense budget, indicating that the ChinaTaiwan defense expenditure gap could be greater. Amid
this situation, President Tsai has ordered an increase in
Taiwan’s defense budget.
According to the “Military and Security Developments
Involving the People’s Republic of China” annual report
for 2021 released by the U.S. DoD in November 2021,
as the Chinese military’s force for an invasion against
Taiwan, the PLA has organized six combined-arms
brigades capable of conducting amphibious operations,
comprising four brigades in the Eastern Theater
Command with Taiwan within its range of operations,
and two brigades in the Southern Theater Command.
The PLA aviation and air assault brigades would also
play a role in the event of large-scale landing operations.
The Navy is equipped with new attack submarines,
surface combatants with anti-air capabilities, and
fourth-generation naval aircraft to build a system to
achieve maritime superiority within the First Island
Chain as well as to deter third-party intervention. On
the other hand, the acquisition of amphibious platform
docks and landing helicopter assault ships is modest,
and transport capabilities are expected to remain
limited. The Air Force has acquired advanced aircraft
to conduct air and ground attack operations. It is also
considered to have a strong air defense network against
attacks on key Chinese military installations and other
facilities and a high ISR capability to support military

operations in the event of an advance into Taiwan. In
addition to this, the Strategic Support Force would
conduct cyber and psychological warfare in the event
of a Taiwan contingency, and the Joint Logistic Support
Force, newly formed in 2016, would be responsible for
integrated logistical support missions.
In a report on China’s military capabilities submitted
to the Legislative Yuan, Taiwan’s Ministry of National
Defense stated that although China does not yet have
a complete large-scale landing operation capability due
to insufficient transport assets and logistical support
systems, at the present stage it already possesses soft and
hard kill capabilities such as electronic warfare attacks
west of the first-island-chain. The report also stated
that after China gains air, sea, and cyber superiority,
the possibility of it conducting an integrated landing
operation using a combination of regular amphibious
ships and commercial cargo ships cannot be ruled out,
and evaluated that “the threat to Taiwan is very great.”
While the PLA proceeds to expand its missile naval


and air forces, the Taiwan military is struggling in the
modernization of its equipment.
The military capabilities of China and Taiwan are
generally characterized as follows:
(1) Regarding ground forces, while China possesses
an overwhelming number of troops, its capability
of landing and invading the island of Taiwan
is limited at present. In recent years, however,
China has been steadily improving its landing
and invasion capabilities by building and
commissioning large amphibious ships.
(2) Regarding naval and air forces, China, which
overwhelms Taiwan in terms of quantity, has
also been rapidly strengthening its naval and air
forces in recent years in terms of quality, where
Taiwan used to have superiority over China. In
this situation, Taiwan focuses on developing
asymmetric forces including stealth corvettes.
(3) Regarding missile strike capabilities, it has been

pointed out that Taiwan is developing the “Hsiung
Feng 2ER” surface-to-surface missile, which is
said to have a range of 1,200 km, and is considered
to be aiming to introduce the “AGM-158” longrange air-to-surface missile from the United
States. In addition, Taiwan has been strengthening
its ballistic missile defense, upgrading the PAC-2
to the PAC-3 and introducing the PAC-3 from the
United States. However, China possesses as many
as 1,000 short-range ballistic missiles and other
assets with ranges covering Taiwan. Taiwan is
deemed to lack effective countermeasures.
Comparison of military capabilities should be
made based not only on the troop strength and the
performance and quantity of equipment but also on
various other factors such as the purpose and aspects of
assumed military operations, operational arrangements,
the skill level of personnel, and logistics. Nevertheless,
the overall military balance between China and
Taiwan is tilting to China’s favor, and the gap appears
to be growing year by year. Going forward, attention
needs to be paid to trends such as the strengthening
of Chinese and Taiwanese forces the sale of weapons

to Taiwan by the United States, and Taiwan’s own
development of its main military equipment. As the
possibility of a Chinese invasion of Taiwan has been
pointed out following the February 2022 Russia’s
aggression against Ukraine, Taiwanese President Tsai
Ing-wen says that the situations surrounding Ukraine
and Taiwan are fundamentally different and has
given instructions about raising their early warning of
military developments around the Taiwan Strait and
strengthening their response to “cognitive warfare” by
“external forces” against Taiwan. Tsai emphasized the
importance of national defense by the unity of the whole
Taiwanese people and ordered the Ministry of National
Defense to continue to conduct a rolling review of
the implementation and progress of the new reservist
training system whose education and call-up period was
extended experimentally in 2022. In addition, Taiwan
Defense Minister Chiu Kuo-cheng announced following
the Russia’s aggression against Ukraine that he would
incorporate the Ukrainian experience into part of his
asymmetrical warfare plan continuously strengthening
asymmetrical forces. Furthermore, Taiwan’s Ministry
of National Defense is currently reportedly considering
extending its four-month military training period, which
has been compulsory since the transition to a volunteer
system of military service. In this way, Taiwan has been
working to further bolster its own defense endeavors


since the Russia’s aggression against Ukraine.
China is engaging in unilateral and coercive attempts
to change the status quo, and has been expanding and
intensifying its military activities in maritime and
aerial domains, notably in the East China Sea. It is also
exerting increased pressure on Taiwan in various ways.
Recognizing that China’s attempts to change the
status quo by coercion are a challenge not only for the
Indo-Pacific region but one common to the entire world,
Japan, in cooperation with its ally, the U.S., friendly
nations, and the international community, will pay close
attention to the relevant situation with a sense of crisis
more than ever before.

Kim stated that “our arch-enemy is the war itself” and

**North Korea**
**1**

In another speech in October of the same year, Chairman

**1 General Situation**

emphasized that the possession of military capabilities
constituted the “self-defensive and mandatory right” of a
sovereign nation, and that strengthening military capabilities
was the Party’s “priority policy.” Since February 2022,
North Korea has resumed launches of intercontinental
ballistic missile (ICBM)-class ballistic missiles. Following
the March 24 launch in particular, North Korea reiterated
its intent to enhance its related technologies, announcing
that it will continue to strengthen its nuclear capabilities
while widely publicizing the launch of a new type of
ICBM-class ballistic missile. These remarks indicate that
North Korea will continue to make efforts to maintain and
enhance its military capabilities and combat readiness,
including its nuclear and missile capabilities. According
to the official announcement at the Supreme People’s
Assembly in February 2022, the proportion of the defense
budget in the FY2022 budget of North Korea was 15.9%.
However, it is believed that this represents only a fraction
of the real defense expenditures.
North Korea has continued to promote the development
of weapons of mass destruction (WMDs) and ballistic
missiles and the enhancement of its operation capabilities,
including by conducting six nuclear tests in the past and
repeatedly launching ballistic missiles in recent years.
Technologically, North Korea is considered to have already
miniaturized nuclear weapons to fit ballistic missile
warheads and possess the capability to launch an attack on
Japan with a ballistic missile fitted with a nuclear warhead.
Furthermore, in January 2021, Chairman Kim mentioned
the development of “ultra-modern tactical nuclear
weapons, including intermediate-range cruise missiles.” In
September of the same year and in January 2022, North
Korea announced that it had succeeded in conducting test
launches of long-range cruise missiles.[3]Moreover, North
Korea is assessed to possess large-scale cyber units as
part of its asymmetric military capabilities, engaging in
theft of military secrets and developing capabilities to


**1 General Situation**

In March 2013, Chairman Kim Jong-un[1] adopted the
“Byungjin line” policy of simultaneous economic and
nuclear development. At the 7th Congress of the Korean
Workers’ Party (KWP) in May 2016, he made it clear that
he would uphold the “Byungjin line” as well as the “Songun
politics.”[2] Between 2016 and 2017, North Korea pushed
ahead with three nuclear tests and as many as 40 ballistic
missile launches. The international community responded
by imposing sanctions under relevant UN Security Council
resolutions, while Japan and the United States were among
those who strengthened their own sanctions against North
Korea.
On the other hand, in April 2018, Chairman Kim
declared that the “Byungjin line” had been successfully
carried out as the development of the state nuclear force had
been completed. He also announced that the “new strategic
line” was that the whole of the party and the whole of the
state would fully concentrate efforts on the construction
of a socialist economy. In addition, North Korea decided
to discontinue “nuclear test and inter-continental ballistic
rocket test-fire,” announcing in May 2018 that the nuclear
test ground had been blown up. During the U.S.-North
Korea summit meeting that June, Chairman Kim expressed
the intention to work towards denuclearization of the
Korean Peninsula.
However, the February 2019 U.S.-North Korea
summit meeting ended without the two sides reaching
an agreement. In December of the same year, Chairman
Kim announced the intention to continue developing
strategic weapons until the United States rolled back its
hostile policy towards North Korea. In addition, at the
8th Congress of the KWP in January 2021, North Korea
showed its hostile stance towards the United States. At the
same time, it showed its stance of continuing development
of its nuclear and missile capabilities, including to “further
strengthen the nuclear war deterrent while doing our best to
build up the most powerful military strength.”


As of 2013, Kim Jong-un held the position of the First Chairman of the National Defense Commission. At the Supreme People’s Assembly in June 2016, the National Defense Commission was
renamed the State Affairs Commission, and Kim Jong-un assumed the position of Chairman of the State Affairs Commission. Reflecting this change, “Chairman of the State Affairs Commission”
is used for the title of Kim Jong-un throughout this white paper.

In a written decision of the 7th Congress of the KWP, “Report on the Work of the KWP Central Committee” (May 8, 2016), it has been defined as a basic form of socialist politics that leads the
great undertaking of socialism to victory by giving priority to the military forces in all activities under the principle of military first, and strengthening and relying on the actors in the revolution with
the Korean People’s Army (KPA) acting as the central and main force.

On September 13, 2021, North Korea announced that it successfully test-fired newly-developed long-range cruise missiles on September 11 and 12, and that the missiles had flown for about two
hours and hit a target 1,500 km away. In addition, on January 28, 2022, North Korea announced that on January 25, 2022, it launched a long-range cruise missile, believed to be of a different

attack critical infrastructure of foreign countries. It also
retains largescale special operation forces. In addition,
North Korea has repeatedly used provocative rhetoric and
behavior against relevant countries, including Japan.
Such military activities in North Korea pose grave and
imminent threats to Japan’s security and significantly
undermine the peace and security of the region and the
international community. Since the beginning of 2022 in
particular, North Korea has repeatedly launched missiles
at an extremely high frequency and in new ways and
made successive reference to strengthening its nuclear
capabilities, still maintaining its stance of turning its back
on the international community to continue developing
nuclear and ballistic missiles. Not only that, there is also
the possibility it will engage in further provocative action,
the trend has been growing in recent years.
Needless to say, North Korea’s possession of nuclear
weapons cannot be accepted. At the same time, sufficient
attention needs to be paid to the development and
deployment of ballistic missiles and the like, the military
confrontation on the Korean Peninsula, and the proliferation
of WMDs and missiles by North Korea.
Partly because of North Korea’s closed regime, it is
difficult to accurately capture the details and intentions
of its behavior. However, it is necessary for Japan to pay
utmost attention to them. As for North Korea’s abduction
of Japanese nationals, utmost efforts continue to be made
to realize the return of all abductees to Japan as quickly
as possible by close cooperation with related countries,
including the United States.

**2 Military Posture**

**(1) General Situation**
North Korea has been building up its military capabilities
in accordance with the Four Military Guidelines (extensive
training for all soldiers, modernizing all military forces,
arming the entire population, and fortifying the entire
“country”).[4]

There is significant qualitative disparity between North
Korea’s conventional forces and those of the ROK’s
military and U.S. Forces Korea, and most of North Korea’s
equipment is outdated. Contributory factors to this situation
include the reduction in military assistance from the former
Soviet bloc due to the collapse of the Cold War structure,


limitations on defense spending caused by the sluggish
economy, and the modernization of the ROK’s defense
capability. North Korea’s military forces are comprised
mainly of ground forces, with a total troop strength of
roughly 1.28 million personnel. It still maintains a largescale military force, including artillery units deployed near
the DMZ.
Furthermore, in order to maintain its regime, North
Korea is believed to be planning to build its own nuclear
deterrence and improve its capacity to deal with conflicts
with U.S. and ROK forces by concentrating on building up
its WMD and ballistic missile arsenal, etc. In particular,
since May 2019, North Korea has repeatedly launched new
types of short-range ballistic missiles (SRBMs) capable of
flying at low altitudes with irregular trajectories and other
missiles, rapidly improving missile-related technologies
and operational capabilities, and diversifying their launch
modes to include rail-launched and submarine-launched
types. In this way, North Korea has been striving to expand
more actual warfighting-oriented SRBM capabilities. In
recent years, North Korea has also sought to operationalize
its long-range cruise missiles, and on April 17, 2022,
announced that it had launched a “new-type tactical guided
weapon,” claiming it strengthens “the efficiency in the
operation of tactical nukes of the DPRK.” The background
for North Korea’s series of development and launches
may be that, in addition to acquiring nuclear deterrent
capabilities through the possession of nuclear weapons
and long-range ballistic missiles for the maintenance and
survival of the regime, North Korea aims to acquire the
means to be able to respond in armed conflict that could
occur between itself and the United States and ROK forces
in which conventional forces or tactical nuclear weapons
are used.[5] North Korea has repeatedly disclosed that a
plan called the “five-year plan for the development of the
defence science and the weapon system” was presented at
the Congress of the KWP in January 2021. It is expected
to continue to focus efforts on the development of various
weapons in line with this plan.
North Korea also has forces such as a large-scale special
operations force that can conduct various operations
including collecting intelligence and sabotage. Moreover,
North Korea seems to have many underground military
related installations across its territory.


The Four Military Guidelines were adopted at the 5th plenary meeting of the 4th KWP Central Committee in 1962.

For example, at the 8th Congress of the KWP in January 2021, Chairman Kim stated that North Korea would “develop tactical nuclear weapons to be used as various means according to the

**(2) Military Capabilities**
The North Korean Army comprises about 1.10 million
personnel, and roughly two-thirds of them seem to be
deployed along the DMZ. The main body of the army
is infantry, but the army also maintains armored forces
including at least 3,500 tanks and artillery. North Korea
is believed to deploy long-range artillery along the DMZ,
such as 240 mm multiple rocket launchers and 170 mm
self-propelled artillery guns, which can reach cities and
bases in the northern part of the ROK including Seoul.
The Navy has about 800 ships with a total displacement
of approximately 110,000 tons and is chiefly comprised
of small naval vessels such as high-speed missile craft.
Also, it has about 20 of the former model Romeo-class
submarines, about 40 midget submarines, and about 140
air cushioned landing crafts, the latter two of which are
believed to be used for infiltration and other actions of the
special operations forces.
The Air Force has approximately 550 combat aircraft,
most of which are out-of-date models made in China or the
former Soviet Union. However, some fourth-generation
aircraft such as MiG-29 fighters and Su-25 attack aircraft
are also included. North Korea has a large number of
outdated An-2 transport aircraft as well, which are believed
to be used for transportation of special operations forces.
In addition, North Korea has a large-scale special
operations force[6] and is seen to be recently placing
importance on and strengthening its cyber forces as socalled asymmetric military capabilities.[7]

**3 WMD and Ballistic Missiles**

In recent years, North Korea has been repeatedly launching
ballistic missiles, rapidly improving its operational
capabilities, such as simultaneous launch and surprise
attack. In addition, given the technological maturity
obtained through a series of nuclear tests, North Korea is
assessed to have already miniaturized nuclear weapons to
fit ballistic missile warheads and possesses the capability
to launch an attack on Japan with a ballistic missile fitted
with a nuclear warhead.
These military activities in North Korea pose grave
and imminent threats to Japan’s security and significantly
undermine the peace and security of the region and the


international community. There is also the possibility that
North Korea will engage in further provocative action, as
the trend has been growing in recent years. Additionally,
such development poses a serious challenge to the
entire international community with regard to the nonproliferation of weapons, including WMDs.
In April 2018, North Korea decided to discontinue
“nuclear test and inter-continental ballistic rocket test-fire.”
North Korea also expressed its intention to work towards
denuclearization at the inter-Korean summit meeting that
month and at the U.S.-North Korea summit meeting in June
of the same year. In May of the same year, international
press representatives were shown the destruction of the
northern nuclear test ground.
However, North Korea has not yet carried out the
dismantlement of all WMDs and ballistic missiles of
all ranges in a complete, verifiable, and irreversible
manner. Not only that, it has also resumed launches of
ballistic missiles in violation of relevant Security Council
resolutions since May 2019, including SRBMs capable of
flying with irregular trajectories.
In addition, in December 2019, Chairman Kim
announced the intention to continue developing strategic
weapons until the United States rolled back its hostile
policy towards North Korea, citing reasons such as the
U.S.-ROK joint military exercises.
At the 8th Congress of the KWP held in January 2021,
Chairman Kim indicated a stance of further enhancing
nuclear and missile capabilities and continuously
improving North Korea’s military power. He referred
to the advancement of nuclear technology, including the
development of “tactical nuclear weapons,” and preemptive
and retaliatory nuclear strike capabilities, as well as
development of “hypersonic gliding flight warheads” and
so on.
In line with this statement, in March 2021, North Korea
launched a new type of SRBMs and announced that it
was “an important process for achieving the national
defense science policy presented by the Congress of the
KWP.” Since September of the same year, North Korea
has also been improving its related technologies and
operational capabilities based on its own plans, including
the successive launches of ballistic missiles flying with
irregular trajectories, a missile it calls a “hypersonic
missile,” and a new type of submarine-launched ballistic


James Thurman, then Commander of the U.S. Forces Korea, stated, “North Korea possesses the world’s largest special operations force of over 60,000” in his speech at the Association of U.S.
Army in October 2012. Additionally, the 2020 Defense White Paper of the ROK notes about North Korea’s Special operations force, “The forces are estimated at approximately 200,000 strong.”

missile (SLBM).
In addition, since entering into 2022, North Korea
has resumed launches of intermediate-range ballistic
missile (IRBM)-class and longer range ballistic missiles,
which it had not done since 2018, unilaterally escalating
its provocations even as the international community
was responding to Russia’s aggression of Ukraine. After
launching an ICBM-class ballistic missile on March 24
of that year, it stated that it would strengthen its nuclear
capabilities and develop further means of attack. Such
recent remarkable development of nuclear and missilerelated technologies by North Korea cannot be overlooked
for the security of Japan and the region. This series of
actions by North Korea threatens the peace and security of
Japan, the region, and the international community. With
it still maintaining its stance of turning its back on the
international community to continue developing nuclear
and ballistic missiles, it is necessary for Japan to continue
carefully monitoring trends in what actions North Korea
takes moving forward.

**(1) Nuclear Weapons**
a. The Current Status of the Nuclear Weapons Program
Details of the current status of North Korea’s nuclear
weapons program are largely unclear because North Korea
remains an extremely closed regime. However, considering
that North Korea has already conducted six nuclear tests,
it is conceivable that North Korea has made considerable
progress in its nuclear weapons program.
With regard to plutonium, a fissile material that can be
used for nuclear weapons,[8] North Korea has suggested
its production and extraction on several instances.[9] As
for recent activities, in September 2015, North Korea
announced that all nuclear facilities in Yongbyon,
including the nuclear reactor and the reprocessing facility,
the disablement of which was agreed upon at the fifth and
the sixth round of the Six-Party Talks in February and
September 2007, respectively, had been readjusted and
had started normal operation. Because the restarting of
the reactor could lead to the production and extraction of
plutonium by North Korea, those activities are causes of


Object claimed to be a hydrogen bomb loaded on ICBM

great concern.
As for highly enriched uranium that can also be used
for nuclear weapons, in June 2009, North Korea declared
the commencement of uranium enrichment. In November
2010, North Korea disclosed its uranium enrichment facility
to American nuclear specialists and later announced that it
was operating a uranium enrichment plant equipped with
thousands of centrifuges. The expansion of this uranium
enrichment plant has been suggested in recent years; in this
regard, North Korea could have increased its enrichment
capabilities. The series of North Korean behaviors related
to uranium enrichment indicate the possibility of the
development of nuclear weapons using highly enriched
uranium in addition to plutonium.[10] In general, facilities
used for uranium enrichment are more secretive in
appearance than reactors used for plutonium production,
and it is difficult to ascertain their activities from the
outside. On the other hand, plutonium has a smaller critical
mass than uranium, and it is pointed out that it is easier to
make nuclear weapons smaller and lighter. In light of both
these advantages, North Korea may continue to promote
the development of both plutonium and uranium types of
nuclear weapons.
In regard to related nuclear activities, North Korea is
believed to be continuing to promote the improvement of its
nuclear capabilities. A report compiled by the International
Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) in August 2021 pointed
out that there were signs that some nuclear-related facilities


8 Plutonium is synthetically produced in a nuclear reactor by irradiating uranium with neutrons, and then extracting it from used nuclear fuel at a reprocessing facility. Plutonium is then used as a
basic material for the production of nuclear weapons. Meanwhile, in order to use uranium for nuclear weapons, it is necessary to extract uranium 235 (U235), a highly fissile material, from natural
uranium. This process is called enrichment. Generally, a large-scale enrichment facility that combines thousands of centrifuges is used to boost the U235 concentration to nuclear weapon levels
(over 90%).

9 North Korea announced in October 2003 that it had completed the reprocessing of 8,000 used fuel rods that contain plutonium, and in May 2005 that it had completed extraction of an additional
8,000 used fuel rods. The 2020 Defense White Paper of the ROK estimates that North Korea possesses around 50 kg of plutonium, retaining the assessment given in the 2018 Defense White
Paper.

10 The 2020 Defense White Paper of the ROK assesses that North Korea possesses a substantial amount of highly enriched uranium (HEU). It has been noted that a uranium enrichment facility

had been operating since the beginning of that year, and
that this was “a cause for serious concern.” For example, It
has been pointed out that the nuclear reactor at Yongbyon,
which was believed to have been out of operation since
2018, has restarted operations since July 2021.[11]

With regard to the development of nuclear weapons,
North Korea conducted nuclear tests on October 9, 2006,
May 25, 2009, February 12, 2013, January 6, 2016,
September 9, 2016, and September 3, 2017. It is highly
likely that North Korea has made strides in its nuclear
weapons program, collecting the necessary data through
these nuclear tests.
It is believed that North Korea seeks to miniaturize
nuclear weapons and develop them into warheads that


can be carried by ballistic missiles, as part of its nuclear
weapons program. In September, 2017, it was announced
that Chairman Kim Jong-un had visited North Korea’s
Nuclear Weapons Institute and had seen a hydrogen bomb
capable of being loaded into an ICBM, in addition to which,
following North Korea’s sixth nuclear test that was forced
through on the same day, North Korea announced that it
“successfully carried out a test of H-bomb for ICBM.”
In regard to miniaturization of a nuclear weapon small
enough to be carried by a ballistic missile, considering
the fact that the United States, the former Soviet Union,
the United Kingdom, France, and China succeeded in
acquiring such technology by as early as the 1960s, as well
as the technological maturity that is estimated to have been

reached through North Korea’s previous six nuclear tests,
it is assessed that North Korea has already miniaturized
nuclear weapons to fit ballistic missile warheads.[12] There
have also been reports that North Korea possesses 40 to 50
nuclear warheads.[13]

Furthermore, the yield of the sixth nuclear weapons
test in 2017 was estimated to be the largest ever, with a
maximum yield of approximately 160 kt. Given the size
of the estimated yield, the possibility cannot be discounted
that the test was of a hydrogen bomb.[14]

In addition, it has been suggested that North Korea has
been working on restoring its northern nuclear test site
since March 2022, which it publicly announced it had
blown up in 2018.
In any case, North Korea’s nuclear weapons development,
considered in conjunction with North Korean efforts to
enhance ballistic missile capabilities, including extending


the range of ballistic missiles that are the delivery vehicles
of WMDs, poses grave and imminent threats to Japan’s
security, and significantly undermines peace and security
of the region and international community. These trends
have been growing in recent years, and it can never be
accepted.
b. Background of the Nuclear Program
North Korea’s ultimate goal is allegedly the maintenance of
the existing regime.[15] Taking into account aspects such as
claims by North Korea that nuclear weapons would never
be traded away at negotiations, as well as the significant
qualitative disparity in conventional forces vis-à-vis the
United States and the ROK, it is believed that North Korea
is promoting nuclear development with the recognition that
it needs its own nuclear deterrence to maintain its regime
against the threat from the United States, which includes
nuclear weapons.


12 Over ten years have already passed since North Korea conducted its first nuclear test in October 2006. Furthermore, North Korea has conducted six nuclear tests to date. This timetable for
technology development and the number of tests are reaching levels that are by no means inadequate, even when compared to the processes of developing technologies to miniaturize and lighten
nuclear weapons in the United States, former Soviet Union, the United Kingdom, France, and China. The 2020 Defense White Paper of the ROK assesses that “North Korea’s ability to miniaturize
nuclear weapons seems to have reached a considerable level.”

13 According to SIPRI Yearbook 2021.
14 The 2020 Defense White Paper of the ROK noted that the explosive yield of the sixth nuclear test was approximately 50 kt, significantly larger than the yield of the past tests and that this was
assessed to be a hydrogen bomb test. North Korea also insisted that its fourth nuclear test, conducted in January 2016, was a hydrogen bomb test. However, given that the yield of that test is
estimated at 6 to 7 kts, it is difficult to conceive that this was a hydrogen bomb test as generally defined.

North Korea has repeatedly insisted that it will not agree
to unilateral denuclearization, making its own status as a
“nuclear weapon state” a prerequisite, including Chairman
Kim’s statement in January 2021 that North Korea would
be a “responsible nuclear weapon state.” In addition, it has
been noted that even after announcing a commitment to
complete denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula, North
Korea has continued nuclear development[16] and that a
uranium enrichment facility not disclosed by North Korea
exists.
In March 2022, Chairman Kim Jong-un stated that
North Korea would “keep bolstering the powerful nuclear
war deterrence qualitatively and quantitatively so as to
ensure the security of the country and cope with all kinds
of potential crises in the future,” and with the possibility of
further provocative action, Japan must keep a close watch
on what kind of actions North Korea will take moving
forward.

**(2) Biological and Chemical Weapons**
North Korea is an extremely closed regime. In addition,
most materials and technology used for manufacturing
biological and chemical weapons are for both military
and civilian uses, which in turn facilitates camouflage.
For these reasons, details of the status of North Korea’s
biological and chemical weapons development and arsenals
are unclear. However, with regard to chemical weapons,
North Korea is suspected to have several facilities capable
of producing chemical agents and already a substantial
stockpile of such agents. North Korea is also thought to
have some infrastructure for the production of biological
weapons.[17] Possession of sarin, VX, mustard and other
chemical weapons, and of anthrax, smallpox, pest and
other biological agents that could be used as biological


weapons have been pointed out.
The possibility cannot be denied that North Korea is able
to load biological and/or chemical weapons on warheads.

**(3) Ballistic Missiles**
As is the case with WMDs, many of the details of North
Korea’s ballistic missiles are unknown, partly owing to
the North Korea’s extremely closed regime. It appears,
however, that North Korea gives high priority to the
development of ballistic missiles out of political and
diplomatic considerations and from the viewpoint of
earning foreign currency, in addition to enhancing its
military capabilities. The ballistic missiles deemed to have
been possessed and developed by North Korea are the
following.[18]

16 According to “North Korea Military Power” released by the U.S. Defense Intelligence Agency (DIA) in October 2021, and others.

17 The 2020 Defense White Paper of the ROK points out that, following the commencement of production in the 1980s, it is estimated that North Korea has a stock of 2,500-5,000 tons of various
chemical weapons stored. It also notes that North Korea likely has the capability to produce a variety of biological weapons including anthrax, smallpox, and pests. North Korea ratified the Biological
Weapons Convention in 1987 but has not acceded to the Chemical Weapons Convention.

18 According to “Jane’s Sentinel Security Assessment China and Northeast Asia” (accessed in March 2022) North Korea possesses 700 to 1,000 ballistic missiles in total, 45% of which are

(i) SRBM A
The SRBM (described by North Korea as “new type of
tactical guided weapon”) launched in 2019 on May 4 and
9, July 25, and August 6 as well as on January 27, 2022 are
all presumed to have the same system. Two missiles were
launched on each of the aforementioned dates and flew up to
approximately 600 km. In terms of the shape, the launched
missiles have a similarity to that of the Russian short-range
ballistic missile “Iskander.” It is also presumed that this
missile is able to fly at a lower altitude than conventional
ballistic missiles with an irregular trajectory, and that it is
pointed out that it can carry nuclear warheads.[20]

North Korea also launched two SRBMs on both
September 15, 2021 and January 14, 2022. Based on images
released by North Korea, these missiles were launched
from railway cars that appear to have been converted from
ordinary freight cars. They have external similarities with
SRBM A, and it is possible that they were developed based
on that missile. North Korea has announced that it was a
firing drill by the “railway-borne missile regiment,” and
has also expressed its intention to expand the formation in
the future.
In this way, North Korea has been pursuing the
operationalization of the SRBM A while diversifying its
launch modes towards its mass production and deployment,
and future developments will be closely watched.
(ii) SRBM B
The SRBM (described by North Korea as “new weapon”
or as “tactical guided weapon”) launched on August 10 and
16, 2019, on March 21, 2020, and on January 17, 2022 are
all presumed to have the same system and to be of a different
type from the aforementioned SRBM A. Two missiles were
launched on each of the aforementioned dates and flew
approximately 250-400 km. It is also presumed that this
missile is able to fly at a lower altitude than conventional
ballistic missiles with an irregular trajectory.
(iii) SRBM C


The SRBM (North Korea calls super-large multiple rocket
launcher”) launched in 2019 on August 24, September 10,
October 31, and November 28, and on March 2, 9 and
29, 2020 are all presumed to be of a different type from
the aforementioned SRBM A and B. Two missiles were
launched on each of the aforementioned dates and flew
approximately 300-400 km. Some of the intervals between
launches were estimated less than 1 minute, suggesting
that North Korea is trying to improve the continuous fire
capability required for saturation attacks and the like.
Regarding TELs, various types can be confirmed in images
published by North Korea.
Details are still being analyzed for the three ballistic
missiles launched on May 12, 2022, including the
possibility that they were SRBM C.
(iv) SRBMs launched in March 2021
On March 25, 2021, North Korea launched two new-type
SRBMs (called “new-type tactical guided missile” by
North Korea) that had never been launched previously.
This missile is presumed to have the same system as the
one mounted on the five-axle TEL which appeared in the
military parade in January of the same year. It has been
pointed out that the launched missile may have been
developed based on the SRBM A, which is believed to
be capable of flying at lower altitudes than conventional
ballistic missiles with irregular trajectories.[21] Taking
this into account, it is estimated that the missiles flew
approximately 600 km.
In addition, North Korea carried out two launches of
what could have been SRBMs on July 31, 2019 and another
two a couple of days later, on August 2.
Through such launches, North Korea appears to
be pursuing enhancement of related technologies and
operational capabilities, including enhancing secrecy and
instantaneity, to make it difficult to detect signs of a launch.
It also appears to be improving its ability to conduct
surprise attacks and its continuous fire capability, as well
as missile flight at low altitudes with irregular trajectories.
Considering the distances flown, it would appear that not
only the ROK, but also parts of Japan would be within


19 The signs of a launch from a fixed launcher are easy for the adversary to detect and are vulnerable to attack by the adversary. TEL was developed mainly by the former Soviet Union, among
others, in order to make the detection of launch signs more difficult and increase survivability. According to the National Air and Space Intelligence Center’s “Ballistic and Cruise Missile Threat”
published in January 2021, North Korea possesses a maximum of 100 TELs for Scuds, 100 TELs for Nodongs, and 50 TELs for IRBMs (Musudans).
As for a TEL-mounted missile launch, it is deemed difficult to detect individual specific signs in advance concerning the detailed location and timing of the launch. This is because it is operated
by being mounted and transported on a TEL, and furthermore, military-related underground facilities are thought to exist all over North Korea.
Along with activities related to the development of ballistic missiles, developments related to the building of TELs require close watch as they concern the operational capabilities of ballistic
missiles by North Korea.

20 According to the Congressional Research Service’s “North Korea’s Nuclear Weapons and Missile Programs” (updated December 2021) and others.
21 In April 2021, ROK Defense Minister Suh Wook answered in the ROK National Assembly that the missile flew in a “pull-up maneuver.” In addition, the “Midterm Report of the Panel of Experts of

range of some of the SRBMs launched. There is also a
concern that this short-range ballistic missile technology
will be applied to longer-range missiles in due course.
(b) Scud
The Scud is a liquid fuel propellant single-stage ballistic
missile and is transported and operated on a TEL.
Scud B is an SRBM with a range of 300 km, and Scud
C is an SRBM with an extended range of 500 km. It is
believed that North Korea has manufactured and deployed
them, and has exported them to the Middle East and other
countries.
The Scud ER (Extended Range) is a ballistic missile that
has an extended range due to the extension of the Scud’s
body as well as the reduction in weight of the warhead,
among other factors. The range of the Scud ER is estimated
to reach approximately 1,000 km, and it appears that a part
of Japan falls within this range.
Furthermore, North Korea is also developing a
ballistic missile that appears to be an improvement of
the Scud missile. This ballistic missile was launched on
May 29, 2017. A day later, North Korea announced that
it had successfully conducted the new development and
test launch of a ballistic rocket incorporating a precision
navigation guidance system.
In addition, while the images released by North Korea
show that the ballistic missile was launched from a
continuous-tracked TEL and had what appears to be small
wings on its warhead, i.e., characteristics different from
those of existing Scud missiles, the shape other than the
warhead and length are similar to existing Scud missiles.
Another similarity is that it can be confirmed that the
missile has straight-line exhausts characteristic of a liquid
fuel-propelled engine. It has also been noted that this
ballistic missile is equipped with a Maneuverable Re-entry
Vehicle (MaRV).[22] North Korea is believed to be improving
the accuracy of its ballistic missile attacks.
(c) Nodong
The Nodong is a liquid fuel propelled single-stage ballistic
missile and is transported and operated on a TEL. It is
assessed to have a range of about 1,300 km, reaching
almost all of Japan.


Nodong is likely based on Scud technology, while
the details of its performance have not been confirmed.
Although Nodong may not be able to carry out precise
strikes on specific target installations, it has been
suggested that North Korea is working to increase the
Nodong’s accuracy.A launch aimed at enhancing accuracy
by improving the shape of the warhead (whose range is
deemed to reach approximately 1,500 km through the
weight reduction of the warhead) was confirmed for the
first time in the images published by North Korea a day
after the launch of one Scud and two Nodong missiles on
July 19, 2016.
(d) Submarine-Launched Ballistic Missile (SLBM)
North Korea is believed to possess one Gorae-class
submarine (displacement of approximately 1,500 tons)
that is capable of carrying and launching a single SLBM
and is being operated mainly as a test vessel. In addition,
North Korea is believed to be upgrading its existing
Romeo-class submarines to carry SLBMs. Furthermore,
in January 2021, Chairman Kim mentioned the goal of
possessing nuclear submarines.
North Korea has been developing SLBMs to be mounted
on these submarines, and in May 2015, it announced the
first successful test launch of an SLBM.[23] It is deemed
that through developing the SLBM and a new submarine
to carry it, North Korea intends to diversify its ballistic
missile attack capabilities and improve survivability.
(i) SLBM “Pukguksong”
Following North Korea’s launch of an SLBM (the
“Pukguksong” type according to the North Korean
designation) from a Gorae-class submarine on April 23,
2016, it launched the same missile a total of three times in
July and August of the same year.
Judging from the images and footage that it has made
public so far, North Korea may have succeeded in operating
the “cold launch system,” in which the missile is ignited
after it is ejected into the air. Moreover, it appears, based on
observations such as the shape of the flame coming out of
the missile and the color of the smoke, that the solid fuelpropelled system was adopted.
The “Pukguksong” missile that was launched in August


22 According to “Jane’s Sentinel Security Assessment China and Northeast Asia” (accessed in March 2022), the launch on May 29, 2017, was presumed to have been the first launch of a short-range
ballistic missile based on a Scud missile, equipped with a MaRV, suggesting that North Korea has made advances in its precision guidance systems.

23 Through now, the MOD has presumed and announced six instances of SLBM launches by North Korea on April 23, 2016 (“Pukguksong” type), July 9, 2016 (“Pukguksong” type), August 24,
2016 (“Pukguksong” type), October 2, 2019 (“Pukguksong-3” type), October 19, 2021 (“new type of SLBM”) and May 7, 2022 (“new type of SLBM”). Among these, the 2016, 2021 and 2022
launches (five in total) were evaluated as being made from a Gorae-class submarine.
In addition, on May 9, 2015, North Korea announced that it had succeeded in a test launch of an SLBM. On January 8, 2016, it released footage of an SLBM test launch that appeared to be
different from the one unveiled in May 2015.
In regard to the July 9, 2016 launch announced by the MOD, North Korea has not disclosed the fact that the launch took place.


**Chapter**

-----

2016 flew about 500 km, but was on a somewhat higher
trajectory compared to the normal altitude of a ballistic
missile with a firing range of 500 km. If it were launched
with a nominal trajectory, the firing range is expected to
surpass 1,000 km.
(ii) SLBM “Pukguksong-3”
On October 2, 2019, North Korea launched one SLBM
(referred to as the “Pukguksong-3” by North Korea)
different from the “Pukguksong” SLBM. This SLBM is
estimated to have flown about 450 km. As it reached a
maximum altitude of about 900 km, it is surmised to have
been launched with a lofted trajectory. If launched with
a nominal trajectory, it is estimated that it could have a
range of approximately 2,000 km. The characteristic radial
exhausts of solid fuel-propelled engines are identifiable on
images published by North Korea. The SLBM in question
could potentially have been launched from underwater
launch test equipment.
In addition, North Korea showcased two possible
new types of SLBMs referred to as “Pukguksong-4”
and “Pukguksong-5” in the military parades in October
2020 and January 2021 respectively. In addition, an
exhibition titled Defence Development Exhibition “SelfDefence-2021” held in October 2021 featured an exhibited
item that had external similarities to the “Pukguksong-5.”
(iii) New Type of SLBM
North Korea launched a new type of SLBM on October
19, 2021, and May 7, 2022. This SLBM is believed to have
been launched from a Gorae-class submarine both times,
and flew with an irregular trajectory at a low altitude before
falling into the Sea of Japan. The trajectory of the October
2021 launch in particular is believed to have been a socalled pull-up trajectory, in which the SLBM descended
once, maneuvered again, and then ascended.
Based on images released by North Korea, it is possible
that the missile was developed based on the SRBM A, as it
has external similarities with that missile. In addition, the
item that appeared to be an SLBM exhibited at the Defence
Development Exhibition “Self-Defence-2021” held in the
same month, of which the name has not been announced by
North Korea, is believed to have been a representation of
the SLBM launched at that time.
(e) Ballistic Missile Modified from the SLBM
North Korea launched a ballistic missile on both February
12 and May 21, 2017, both of which appeared to be a
modified version of the SLBM “Pukguksong” for ground
launch (referred to by North Korea as “Pukguksong-2”).
This ballistic missile is estimated to have flown


approximately 500 km on both occasions, on somewhat
higher trajectories than normal. If it were launched with a
nominal trajectory, the firing range is assessed to surpass
1,000 km. A day after the launch in February of the same
year, North Korea announced that it was developed as a
ground-to-ground ballistic missile based on the results of
the August 2016 SLBM launch. It also announced a day
after the launch in May 2017 that it had again successfully
conducted the test launch of the missile and that Chairman
Kim Jong-un had authorized its “operational deployment.”
Moreover, the launch by a “cold launch system,” in
which the missile is ignited after it is ejected into the air
from a continuous-tracked TEL, and the characteristic
radial exhausts of solid fuel-propelled engines, can be
confirmed from each of the images that North Korea
released. It has the characteristics of appearing to be using
“cold launch system” and solid fuel-propelled engines in
common with the SLBM “Pukguksong.”
(f) Intermediate-Range Ballistic Missile (IRBM)-Class
To date North Korea has launched four liquid fuel-propelled
IRBM-class ballistic missiles (referred to by North Korea
as “Hwasong-12”). One of these ballistic missiles was
launched on each of May 14, 2017 and January 30, 2022,
and based on their flight patterns, it is presumed that they
were launched with a lofted trajectory. Had they been
launched with a nominal trajectory, the maximum firing
range is assessed to be close to approximately 5,000 km. In
addition, the straight-line exhausts characteristic of a liquid
fuel propelled engine can be confirmed from the images
released by North Korea a day after the launch, suggesting
that the “Hwasong-12” uses liquid fuel.
On August 29 and September 15, 2017, single
“Hwasong-12” missiles were launched and flew over
Japan’s territory in the vicinity of the Oshima Peninsula
and Cape Erimo. These launches were the first cases of
North Korea launching what it calls ballistic missiles that
flew over Japan’s territory.
In view of their flight paths, these missiles appear to
demonstrate a certain level of function as an IRBM. Also,
the fact that missiles that overflew Japan were launched in
succession in a short time period would suggest that North
Korea is steadily improving its ballistic missile capabilities.
Furthermore, in the May and August launches of
the same year, it was confirmed that the missiles were
launched after being separated from the wheeled-drive
TEL. However, in the September launch, it was confirmed
that the missile was launched while still mounted on the
wheeled drive TEL North Korea claimed that the launch

was for confirming practical operational procedures and
“realizing the potential of the ‘Hwasong-12.’” At the time
of the January 2022 launch, it stated that it had tested a
“being produced and deployed ‘Hwasong-12.’” Based on
the series of announcements, it is believed that the missile
has been further operationalized since 2017 and may be in
the production stage.
In 2016 North Korea conducted repeated launches of the
Musudan that is presumed to be an IRBM-class ballistic
missile,[24] but although the missile launched in June of the
same year flew a certain distance with a lofted trajectory,
the fact that there were two successive launch failures in
October of the year would suggest that there may still be
obstacles remaining towards the operationalization of the
Musudan and that North Korea may be concentrating on the
development and operationalization of the “Hwasong-12”
as an IRBM-class instead.
(g) Intercontinental Ballistic Missile (ICBM)-Class
(i) ICBM-class “Hwasong-14”
North Korea launched ICBM-class ballistic missiles
(referred to by North Korea as “Hwasong-14”) on July 4
and 28, 2017. From the flight pattern, it is presumed that
the two missiles were launched with a lofted trajectory. If
they were to have been launched with a normal trajectory,
it is estimated that they would have a maximum range of at
least 5,500 km. The missiles were presumed to be of twostage construction.
On July 4 of the same year, the day of the launch, North
Korea made an “important announcement,” announcing
that it had successfully conducted a test launch of a new
type of ICBM. Furthermore, on the day following the July
28 launch, North Korea announced that the “nuclear bomb
detonation device” had functioned normally, emphasizing
that the safety of the warhead in an atmospheric reentry
environment had been made maintained. This suggests
that North Korea is aiming to operationalize long-range
ballistic missiles.
Based on the released images, the “Hwasong-14”type ICBM-class ballistic missiles have the following
in common with the “Hwasong-12”-type IRBM-class
ballistic missile: (1) the configuration of engine system
(one main engine and four auxiliary engines); (2) the shape
of the lower part of the propulsion system (conical shape);


and (3) the straight-line flame of liquid-propulsion systems
can be confirmed. Based on the respective ranges that can
be estimated for the missiles and other matters, it can be
assumed that the ICBM-class ballistic missile was possibly
developed on the basis of the “Hwasong-12”-type IRBMclass ballistic missile.
Also, based on images published by North Korea, it can
be confirmed that the “Hwasong-14”-type missiles had
been mounted on the wheeled eight-axle TEL similar to
KN-08/14.[25] However, it can be confirmed from the images
at the time of the launches that they were launched from
simplified launch pads, not TELs.
(ii) ICBM-class “Hwasong-15”
On November 29, 2017, North Korea launched a
single missile that is presumed to have been an ICBMclass ballistic missile (referred to by North Korea as
“Hwasong-15”). From the flight pattern it is presumed
that the missile was launched with a lofted trajectory. On
the day of the launch, North Korea made a “government
statement,” declaring that it had successfully conducted
a test launch of the “Hwasong-15,” a newly developed
type of ICBM with the capability to strike all areas of the
U.S. mainland, and asserting that it had now completed
development of its state nuclear force.
The following points would suggest that this missile is an
ICBM-class ballistic missile, different from the “Hwasong14”-type ballistic missile: (1) its flight distance and
altitude; (2) North Korea’s announcement (the successful
test launch of a new type of ICBM, the “Hwasong-15”
was announced); (3) the fact that the missile was deployed
on a previously unseen nine-axle wheel-drive TEL; and
(4) shape of the warhead nose being more rounded than
previous missiles. In addition, according to released
images, the missile was of a two-stage design, and it can
be confirmed that it was removed from the TEL prior to
launch and that its straight-line exhausts are characteristic
of a liquid fuel propelled engine.
Furthermore, based on the flight altitude, distance
flown and released images, it can be assumed that the
“Hwasong-15” could have a range in excess of 10,000 km,
depending on the weight of the warhead deployed, etc.
In addition, although the wheel-drive TELs possessed
by North Korea are thought to be modified versions of


24 It has been suggested that, given its range of between 2,500 and 4,000 km, all parts of Japan and Guam may fall within the Musudan’s firing range. Similar to its Scud and Nodong counterparts,
it is liquid fuel-propelled and is loaded onto a TEL to transport and operate. It has been noted that Musudan is a revamped version of the Russian SLBM SS-N-6 that North Korea acquired in the
early 1990s.

25 The details of the new missile “KN-08” which was showcased at the military parade in April 2012 and July 2013 are unknown. However, the missile is believed to be an ICBM. At the military parade
in October 2015, a new missile thought to be the “KN-08” was showcased with a different-shaped warhead from the previous version. The new missile, considered a variant of the “KN-08,” is

Russian and Chinese TELs, it is noteworthy that North
Korea has claimed to have developed its own TEL.
(iii) Further increasing range of ICBM-class ballistic
missiles
North Korea launched one ballistic missile on both February
27 and March 5, 2022. Both are estimated to have been
launched with a lofted trajectory, flying approximately
300 km and reaching maximum altitudes of approximately
600 km and 550 km respectively. North Korea announced
the day after each launch that they were “reconnaissance
satellite” development tests, but it is believed that it was
a new type of ICBM-class ballistic missile (referred to by
North Korea as “Hwasong-17”) that was launched.
On March 24, North Korea again launched an ICBMclass ballistic missile, announcing the next day that it
had test-launched a “Hwasong-17”-type missile.[26] The
missile flew over 1,100 km with a lofted trajectory and
reached a maximum altitude of approximately over 6,000
km, far exceeding that of the “Hwasong-15” launched in
November 2017. Based on the trajectory, it can be assumed
that the missile could have a range in excess of 15,000
km, depending on the weight of the warhead deployed,
etc., thus renewing concerns over the increasing ranges of
North Korea’s ballistic missiles.
The ICBM-class ballistic missile referred to by North
Korea as “Hwasong-17” was first confirmed at the
military parade in October 2020, and later made another
appearance at the Defence Development Exhibition
“Self-Defence-2021” held in October 2021. The missile
is mounted on an 11-axle TEL, believed to be the largest
in North Korea’s possession, and its size is thought to
exceed that of the existing “Hwasong-15”-type. It has been
suggested that, this raises the possibility that the missile is
more powerful from increased warhead weight and could
feature multiple warheads, which are generally considered
difficult to intercept.
The ballistic missile launched on May 4, 2022 was
launched with a lofted trajectory with a maximum altitude
of about 800 km and a distance of about 500 km, though
details are still being analyzed, including the possibility that
the missile was an ICBM-class ballistic missile. In addition,
one of the at least two ballistic missiles launched on May
25, 2022, which was launched with a lofted trajectory with
a maximum altitude of about 550 km and a distance of
about 300 km, is presumed to have been an ICBM-class


ballistic missile. Details are still being analyzed, including
the possibility that the missile was a “Hwasong-17”-type
ballistic missile.
(h) Taepodong-2
Taepodong-2 is a long-range ballistic missile launched
from a fixed launch pad.[27] It is believed to use in its first
stage, four engines, each of which is developed based on
the technologies of Nodong, and the same type of engine in
its second stage. Its range is estimated to be approximately
6,000 km for the two-stage type, while the range of its
three-stage variant can be more than approximately 10,000
km assuming that the weight of the warhead is not over
approximately 1 ton. Taepodong-2 missiles and its variants
have been launched a total of five times so far.
Most recently, in February 2016, North Korea
conducted a launch of a missile disguised as a “satellite”
from the Tongch’ang-ri district in the northwest coastline
of North Korea using a Taepodong-2 variant after notifying
international organizations. It is assessed that North Korea’s
long-range ballistic missiles’ technological reliability had
been advanced by this launch because it is estimated that
(1) it successfully launched two similar types of ballistic
missiles in a row; (2) the missile flew in almost the same
way as the last launch; and (3) it put an object into orbit
around the Earth.
Accordingly, it is believed that these test launches
of long-range ballistic missiles can contribute to the
development of shorter-range missiles in such ways as
increasing the range and payload capability and improving
target accuracy. Also, related technology, such as the

“hypersonic missile” (January 2022) [AFP=Jiji]


26 North Korea also launched a ballistic missile shortly prior on March 16, 2022, but it is presumed to have not flown properly and other details, including the type of missile, are still being analyzed.

separation technology of multi-stage propelling devices
and the technology of posture control and thrust modulation
of long-range ballistic missiles, can be applied to other
middle-range and long-range ballistic missiles that North
Korea is newly developing. Therefore, the launch may lead
to the further advancement of North Korea’s entire ballistic
missile program and diversification of attack measures.
(i) Ballistic Missiles Referred to as “Hypersonic
Missiles”
On January 5 and 11, 2022, North Korea launched one
ballistic missile, which it referred to as a “hypersonic
missile,” each day. Both missiles are believed to have flown
at lower altitudes than conventional ballistic missiles. In
particular, the missile launched on January 11 may have
flown at a maximum speed of approximately Mach 10 with
an irregular trajectory that included horizontal maneuvers.
Based on images released by North Korea, it is
confirmed that the missiles were launched from a wheeleddrive TEL, and that they had a conical warhead and were
equipped with an engine appearing to be a liquid-fuel
propulsion system. It has been pointed out that the conical
warhead may have been based on Maneuverable Re entry

Vehicle (MaRV)-related technology. In any case, based on
announcements through now, it is clear that North Korea
continues to pursue the development and enhancement of
hypersonic missiles and the like in an attempt to breach
missile defense networks. It is necessary to monitor its
future technological progress, including its application of
these technologies on longer-range missiles and moves
for the development of a possible ballistic missile with
a flat warhead (referred to as the “Hwasong-8” by North
Korea), which was launched on September 28, 2021 with
the designation of being a “hypersonic missile.”
b. Major Trends in Ballistic Missile Launches
North Korea has repeatedly launched various types of
ballistic missiles. The following characteristics can be
observed for their trends.
Firstly, it appears that North Korea seeks to increase the
firing range of ballistic missiles. It is considered necessary
for the operationalization of long-range ballistic missiles to
further verify technology for protecting the re-entry vehicle
from the ultrahigh temperature that is generated during the
atmospheric re-entry of the warhead part. North Korea,
with announcements such as the one in November 2017


**Chapter**
**3**


-----

on the day of the launch of a Hwasong-15 ICBM-class
ballistic missile which could have a range of over 10,000
km depending on the weight of its warhead, claiming
that it had re-verified warhead reliability in a reentry
environment, is displaying an intention to seek to secure
and enhance technology aimed at the operationalization of
long-range ballistic missiles.
In addition, based on the flight trajectory at the time, the
ICBM-class ballistic missile launched by North Korea on
March 24, 2022 can be assumed to have a range in excess
of 15,000 km depending on the weight of the warhead
deployed, etc., in which case the entire U.S. would fall
within its range.
Should North Korea make further progress in the
development of ballistic missiles, including the acquiring
of reentry technologies related to long range ballistic
missiles, it may come to have a one-sided understanding
that it has secured a strategic deterrence against the United
States. If North Korea has such a false sense of confidence
and recognition regarding its deterrence, it could lead to an
increase and escalation of military provocations by North
Korea in the region and could create situations that are
deeply worrying also for Japan.
North Korea is presumed to have acquired the atmospheric
re-entry technologies required for the operationalization
of Nodong and Scud-ER ballistic missiles, within whose
range Japan lies, suggesting that it already has the ability to
attack Japan with nuclear weapons fitted to these ballistic
missiles.
Secondly, North Korea may be aiming to enhance
the accuracy, continuous fire capability, and operational
capabilities necessary for saturation attacks and the like.
As for the Scud and Nodong, since 2014, they have been
launched from unprecedented locations, cutting across
the Korean Peninsula, in the early morning and late hours
of the night using TELs, often in multiple numbers. This
indicates the ability to launch Scud and Nodong missiles
from any place and at any time.
In addition, the four ballistic missiles, apparently
Scud ERs, launched on March 6, 2017, were launched
simultaneously. Furthermore, in recent years, North Korea
has conducted target practice combining SRBMs with
various types of artillery. Through such launches, North
Korea may be working to improve not only its research
and development of ballistic missiles but also its actual
operational capabilities.
Some have noted that a ballistic missile which appears
to have been modified from the Scud missile launched in


May 2017 is equipped with a MaRV. Images of the 2019
ballistic missile launches published by North Korea show
that the missiles were launched from different places and
hit the specific target. This suggests that North Korea is
aiming to enhance the accuracy of attacks by upgrading
its existing ballistic missiles and developing new ballistic
missiles.
Furthermore, in the short-range ballistic missile launches
on November 28, 2019 and March 2, 2020, the interval
between launching the two missiles on both occasions
was estimated at less than 1 minute, suggesting that North
Korea is trying to improve the continuous fire capability
required for saturation attacks and the like.
Thirdly, North Korea appears to be seeking to improve
its ability to conduct surprise attacks by enhancing secrecy
and instantaneity to make it difficult to detect signs of a
launch.
Using a TEL or submarine, a ballistic missile that can be
launched from any point, makes it difficult to detect signs
of it in advance. North Korea has repeatedly launched
ballistic missiles from TELs and SLBMs. Furthermore,
since September 2021, it has also fired rail-launched
ballistic missiles.
In addition, particularly since 2019, North Korea has
repeatedly launched ballistic missiles that appear to have
used solid fuel. It is therefore believed that North Korea is
proceeding with the development of solid-fueled ballistic
missiles. Generally, solid fuel-propelled ballistic missiles
are not only relatively easier to store and handle, but are
also preloaded with solid fuel. Therefore, in comparison
to liquid fuel-propelled missiles, they can be launched
instantly, and the signs of their launch are more difficult to
detect. Furthermore, they can be reloaded more quickly. In
this respect, they are considered to be superior militarily.
Such characteristics are expected to contribute to improving
the ability to conduct surprise attacks.
Fourthly, North Korea is advancing the development
of ballistic missiles that fly at low altitudes with irregular
trajectories in an attempt to breach other states’ missile
defense networks. SRBM A and SRBM B are believed to
be capable of flying at lower altitudes than conventional
ballistic missiles with irregular trajectories. In addition,
rail-launched ballistic missiles and new types of SLBMs
launched after 2021 all have external similarities with
SRBM A and fly with irregular trajectories.
Furthermore, since September of the same year,
North Korea has also repeatedly launched what it calls
“hypersonic missiles ” In this way North Korea is believed


**Chapter**
**3**


-----

to be focusing on missile development to breach missile
defense networks.
Fifthly, North Korea may be attempting to diversify the
forms of launches. It has been confirmed that the June 22,
2016, May 14, July 4, July 28, and November 29, 2017,
October 2, 2019, and January 30, February 27, March
5, March 24, May 4, and May 25, 2022 ballistic missile
launches were with lofted trajectories, in which missiles
are launched to high altitudes at higher angles than normal.
Generally, when a launch is made with a lofted trajectory,
interception is considered to be more difficult.
In this way, North Korea is continuously proceeding
with ballistic missile development at an extremely rapid
pace. In particular, North Korea has been focusing on
more advanced related technologies to breach missile
defense networks in recent years, including successively
launching ballistic missiles that use solid fuel and fly at
lower altitudes than conventional ballistic missiles and
with irregular trajectories. There are concerns that such
advanced technologies will be applied to longer-range
missiles.
North Korea is relentlessly pursuing increasingly
complex and diverse modes of attack and is steadily
strengthening and improving its attack capabilities. These
enhancements in its capabilities make early detection of the
signs of a launch and the interception of the missiles more
difficult, thereby posing new challenges for the collection
of information, early warning, and interception postures
of relevant states, including Japan. It is necessary that
we continue to carefully monitor moves by North Korea
regarding its ballistic missile development.

**(4) Future Trends in Weapons Development**
At the 8th Congress of the KWP in January 2021, North
Korea stated that it would increase “nuclear war deterrent”
and develop “the most powerful military strength.” North
Korea also specifically mentioned the development of
various weapons as its future goals and showed a stance of
enhancing its military power. It is believed that the “fiveyear plan for the development of the defence science and
the weapon system” was presented at this time.[28]

With regard to nuclear weapons and missiles, North
Korea stated that it had developed “ultra-modern tactical
nuclear weapons, including intermediate-range cruise


missiles. It also referred to the development of tactical
nuclear weapons” as further advancement of nuclear
technology, miniaturization and weight reduction of
nuclear weapons, and development of tactical weapons. It
also stated that it would accelerate the production of “supersized nuclear warheads,” improve its hit rate on targets
within a 15,000 km range, and upgrade its “preemptive
and retaliatory nuclear strike capabilities.” In addition,
North Korea mentioned the acceleration of research and
development of multi-warhead technology, “hypersonic
gliding flight warheads,” nuclear-powered submarines,
and solid fuel-propelled ICBM, demonstrating its stance
of relentlessly pursuing increasingly complex and diverse
modes of attack.
Besides the nuclear and missile capabilities,
development of reconnaissance means, including military
reconnaissance satellites and unmanned aerial vehicles,
was also mentioned.
Since September of the same year, North Korea has
launched missiles including the ones it called “hypersonic
missiles,” as if to actually implement the process of the
development plan presented at the Congress of the KWP.
In addition, what appeared to represent several weapons
mentioned at the Congress of the KWP were displayed at
the Defence Development Exhibition “Self-Defence-2021”
held in October of the same year, demonstrating North
Korea’s stance of continuously strengthening its military
capabilities. In September of the same year, Vice
Department Director of the Central Committee of KWP
Kim Yo-jong stated, “What we did is part of normal and
self-defensive action to carry out the key task for the first
year of the five-year plan.” North Korea is expected to
continue to develop the various weapons and other items
mentioned in the plan and focus on achieving its goals.
In addition, following the February 27 and March 5,
2022 launches of ICBM-class ballistic missiles it claims
were “reconnaissance satellite” development tests, North
Korea publicly announced that Chairman Kim Jong-un had
actually inspected a facility related to the “reconnaissance
satellites,” during which he stated that the objective of the
military reconnaissance satellites is to obtain real-time
military information on South Korea, Japan, and the Pacific
Ocean, that a large number of reconnaissance satellites will
be deployed during the period of the “five-year plan,” and


28 There was no direct reference to the name “five-year plan for the development of the defence science and the weapon system ” in North Korea’s announcement at the Congress of the KWP in
January 2021. However, when there was an announcement of the launch of a long-range cruise missile on September 13 of the same year, the North Korean media mentioned it publicly for
the first time by stating that this missile development project was significant for “meeting the key target of the five-year plan for the development of the defence science and the weapon system

that the Sohae satellite launching station in Tongch ang-ri
district will be renovated and expanded in order to do so.
In light of the situation above, it will be required to
continue paying close attention with great interest to the
trend of North Korea’s weapon development.

**4 Internal Affairs**

**(1) Developments Related to the Kim Jong-un**
**Regime**

In North Korea, the power base centered on Chairman
Kim is being solidified. The constitution was amended in
2019, strengthening Chairman Kim’s authority through
such provisions as the stipulation that the Chairman of the
State Affairs Commission is “the supreme leader of the
Democratic People’s Republic of Korea who represents the
state.” It is pointed out that North Korea is run under the
leadership of the KWP. In January 2021, the 8th Congress
of the KWP was held and Chairman Kim was appointed
general secretary of the KWP.
On the other hand, since 2020, cases have begun to
be seen of senior party officials providing “guidance”
during site inspections and various meetings, which
had previously been performed only by Chairman Kim,
suggesting that some authority may have been delegated
to senior officials. Chairman Kim appears to be aiming for
control by creating a sense of tension through the demotion
and promotion of senior officials in a short period of time.
It is believed that uncertainty is arising, including over the
possibility of North Korea turning to military provocations
without making adequate diplomatic considerations, with
senior officials unable to dispute the decisions of Chairman
Kim.
It has also been pointed out that amid the difficult
economic and food situation, the government is wary of
social unrest caused by the influx of information from
abroad and is further strengthening its ideological control.
This is notable from the perspective of the stability of the
regime.

**(2) Economic Conditions**
In the economic domain, North Korea has been facing


chronic stagnation and energy and food shortages due
to the vulnerability of its socialist planned economy and
diminishing economic cooperation with the former Soviet
Union and East European countries following the end of
the Cold War.[29]

Furthermore, the strengthening of sanctions by states
including Japan and the United States and the sanctions of
the related UN Security Council resolutions in response to
the implementation of nuclear tests and missile launches
can be assumed to have had a certain effect, when
considered together with the severe economic situation of
North Korea.
Additionally, since 2020, COVID-19 infections and
natural disasters, in addition to sanctions, seem to be
having a significant impact on North Korea’s economy. At
the 8th Congress of the KWP in January 2021, Chairman
Kim remarked that, due to “unexpected challenges,” “the
objectives for the growth of the national economy fell a long
way short of implementation and consequently the people’s
living standards could not be improved remarkably.” He
stated that the “five-year plan for the national economic
development” must be executed going forward.
In October of the same year, Chairman Kim referred to
the “ efficient five-years in boosting the national economy
and solving the people’s food, clothing, and housing
problems” and to “building a powerful socialist nation
envied by the world.” North Korea is believed to be placing
importance on rebuilding its economy. Nevertheless, as
North Korea is unlikely to carry out any structural reforms
that could lead to the destabilization of its current ruling
system, it faces various challenges in making fundamental
improvements to its current economic situation.
North Korea is presumed to be evading the UN Security
Council sanctions by conducting ship-to-ship transfers
prohibited by the UN Security Council resolutions.[30] The
final report of the UN Security Council’s Panel of Experts
assisting the North Korea Sanctions Committee (“Final
Report of the Panel of Experts submitted pursuant to
resolution 2569 (2021)”), released in April 2022, points out
that, during the January-September period in 2021, North
Korea illicitly imported a volume of petroleum products
that exceeded the annual aggregate 500,000-barrel cap


29 In recent years, North Korean fishing boats and Chinese fishing boats have been conducting illegal operations within Japan’s exclusive economic zone (EEZ) surrounding Yamato tai, creating a
situation that threatens the safety of Japanese fishing boats operating in the EEZ. In this sea area, the Fisheries Agency and the Japan Coast Guard in cooperation crack down on illegal operations
by foreign fishing boats. See the Cabinet Office Annual Report, “The situation of the oceans and the implemented measures by the Government with regard to the oceans,” the White paper on
Fisheries and the Japan Coast Guard Report for further details of the control activities.

30 Between the beginning of 2018 and the end of March 2022, MSDF patrol aircraft and ships have observed 24 cases in which a North Korean-flagged tanker and a foreign-flagged vessel were
anchored side-by-side on the high seas. As a result of comprehensive judgment by the government, there are strong suspicions that the observed vessels were engaging in illicit ship-to-ship

a much lower degree as compared to previous years.

Resolutions against North Korea)

**5 Relations with States and Regions**

**(1) Relations with the United States**
In June 2018 at the first-ever U.S.-North Korea summit
meeting, President Kim made clear his intention to work
towards the complete denuclearization of the Korean
Peninsula. However, the second U.S.-North Korea summit
meeting in February 2019 ended without any agreement
being reached between the two parties.
Subsequently, Chairman Kim indicated the stance that
there would never be denuclearization on the Korean
Peninsula until the United States rolled back its hostile


policy towards North Korea and that North Korea would
maintain its nuclear deterrence against the United States’
nuclear threat. In January 2021, he referred to the United
States as the “principal enemy” while noting that the key to
establishing a new U.S.-North Korea relationship would be
the withdrawal of the hostile policy by the United States.
The Biden administration of the United States, which
was inaugurated that same month, in April of the same
year, announced that it had completed a review of its policy
towards North Korea and that it would explore diplomacy
with North Korea under a “calibrated, practical approach”
with the continued goal of “complete denuclearization of
the Korean Peninsula.”
In response to these developments, in June of the same
year, Chairman Kim stated that North Korea should “be
prepared for both dialogue and confrontation” and needed
“especially to get fully prepared for confrontation”


**Chapter**
**3**


-----

with regard to its policy towards the United States. In
September of the same year, he stated that there had been
no change in “U.S. military threats and hostile policy” and
that the United States’ claims of “diplomatic engagement”
and “dialogue without preconditions” were “a petty trick
for hiding its hostile acts.” In October of the same year,
Chairman Kim stated that there was not any reason to
believe that the United States was not hostile, but also that
“our arch-enemy is the war itself” and not a specific nation
or power such as the United States.
Furthermore, in January 2022, Chairman Kim ordered
North Korean officials to “promptly examine the issue of
restarting all temporarily suspended activities” based on
the assessment that the “hostile policy and military threat
by the U.S. have reached a danger line that cannot be
overlooked anymore” given that the U.S. has repeatedly
conducted joint military exercises since the U.S.-North
Korea summit meeting. North Korea has actually been
launching ICBM-class ballistic missiles since February
2022, and following the launch on March 24 of the same
year, stated that it would thoroughly prepare for a longterm confrontation with the U.S. In this way, North Korea
has acted in contradiction to its decision to discontinue
“inter-continental ballistic rocket test-fire” it itself
announced in April 2018, and attention will be paid to
future developments, including the possibility of further
escalations of unilateral provocations.

**(2) Relations with the ROK**
In 2018, substantial progress was realized in inter-Korean
relations. The three inter-Korean summit meetings led to
an agreement on the “Panmunjom Declaration,” which
confirmed, among other matters, that the two parties
agreed to completely cease all hostile acts against each
other in every domain, and confirmed the common goal
of realizing a nuclear-free Korean Peninsula. The summit
meetings also led to an agreement on the “Pyongyang Joint
Declaration of September 2018,” which referred to the
ending of military hostilities, and the “Agreement on the
Implementation of the Historic Panmunjom Declaration in
the Military Domain,” which prescribed concrete measures
to ease inter-Korean military tensions.
However, 2019 saw no major advances in inter-Korean
dialogue and cooperation programs, while in 2020 there
was a temporary increase in tension seen in the interKorean relationship. Since June of the same year, North


Korea has reacted to the distribution of flyers criticizing
Chairman Kim by a North Korean defectors group. North
Korea has also shown moves such as the explosion of
the Inter-Korean Joint Liaison Office in Kaesong, and its
announcement that it was considering (and later suspended)
a military action plan that included the strengthening of
military posture along the DMZ.
On the other hand, North Korea appears to be taking a
carrot and stick approach to the ROK. In January 2021, at
the 8th Congress of the KWP, Chairman Kim mentioned
that depending on the attitude of the ROK, inter-Korean
relations could return to a new starting point of peace
and prosperity. In July of the same year, inter-Korean
communication lines, which had been cut off for more than
a year, were restored (they were later cut off in August of
the same year, but then restored again in October of the
same year). In addition, in September of the same year, in
response to the “end-of-war declaration” proposed by then
ROK President Moon Jae-in at the UN General Assembly
that month, Chairman Kim first stated that the ROK should
withdraw its “partial view, unfair and double-dealing
attitude and hostile viewpoint and policies” towards North
Korea, while expressing his belief that the future of interKorean relations depends on the attitude of the ROK side.
Furthermore, in October of the same year, he stated that
tensions on the Korean Peninsula would not arise if the
ROK did not meddle, and that defense forces were not
being strengthened with the ROK as the target, noting that
their history of “ having recourse to arms against the fellow
countrymen” must not be repeated.
Movements in the future of inter-Korean relations,
including the policy toward North Korea of the Yoon Sukyeol administration, inaugurated in May 2022, and North
Korea’s reaction, will be closely watched.

**(3) Relations with Other States**
(i) Relations with China
China is a vital political and economic partner for North
Korea and maintains a degree of influence on North Korea.
The China-North Korea Treaty on Friendship, Cooperation
and Mutual Assistance, which was concluded in 1961, is
still in force. In addition, China is currently North Korea’s
biggest trade partner. In 2020, trade volume between China
and North Korea was very large, accounting for over 90%
of North Korea’s total trade (excluding trade between
North Korea and the ROK),[31] suggesting North Korea’s


**Chapter**
**3**


-----

dependence on China.
In regard to the situation in North Korea and the nuclear
issue, China has stated that the issues should be resolved
through dialogue and consultations based on the concept
of a “dual-track approach” (denuclearization of the Korean
Peninsula and the transition from the armistice mechanism
to a peaceful mechanism) and the principle of phased
and synchronized actions. China also stated that it would
like to play a constructive role in safeguarding peace and
stability on the peninsula as well as realizing lasting peace.
Amidst this, in October 2021, China submitted a draft UN
Security Council resolution on North Korea jointly with
Russia stating that North Korea had already taken many
denuclearization measures and that there should be the


hostile forces challenges and obstructive moves.
(ii) Relations with Russia
Concerning North Korea’s nuclear issue, Russia, along
with China, has expressed support for the denuclearization
on the Korean Peninsula and early resumption of the SixParty Talks. In October 2021, Russia and China jointly
submitted the aforementioned draft UN Security Council
resolution stating that restrictions should be reviewed
in light of North Korea’s “path to denuclearization” and
humanitarian situation.
At the 8th Congress of the KWP in January of the same
year, Chairman Kim referred to laying “a cornerstone for
the expansion of friendly relations with Russia” as the
outcome since the 7th Congress of the KWP. Amid the


adjustment of some sanctions concerning the economy and Russia’s aggression of Ukraine in and after February 2022,

external military threats and invasions, to support peaceful
unification, and to contribute to regional stability and
world peace.”
As one of the “external military threats,” the ROK, in its
Defense White Paper, used to designate North Korea as the
“main enemy” or state that “the North Korean regime and
its military will remain an enemy.” While continuing to
describe North Korea’s WMDs as a threat to the peace and
stability of the Korean Peninsula, the designation of North
Korea as an enemy has been eliminated since the former
Moon Jae-in administration began. Instead, the white paper
states as follows: “The ROK armed forces considers any
force that threatens and violates the sovereignty, territory,
people and properties of the ROK as an enemy.” The Yoon
Suk-yeol administration, however, has indicated that it will
consider once again stating that “the North Korean regime
and its military will remain an enemy” in the Defense
White Paper.
The ROK has continued to undertake reforms of its
national defense. In recent years, in July 2018, the ROK
released the “Defense Reform 2.0,” which has set the
following three main goals: making omni-directional
response to security threats, enhancing military power
based on advanced science and technology and developing
armed forces appropriate for a developed country. This
plan calls for continued promotion of efforts to secure
combat capabilities necessary for responding to the threat
from North Korea and also includes the reduction of the
troops and the mandatory military service period.

**3 Military Posture of the ROK**

The ROK’s military capacity is as follows. The ground
forces consist of 19 army divisions with approximately
420,000 personnel and 2 marine divisions with
approximately 29,000 personnel; the naval forces consist
of approximately 220 vessels with a total displacement of
approximately 280,000 tons; and the air forces (Air Force
and Navy combined) consist of approximately 660 combat
aircraft.
The ROK has been modernizing its military forces- not
only its Army but also its Navy and Air Force-in order to
establish an omni-directional defense posture to deal with
future potential threats, not least threats from North Korea.
The Navy has been introducing submarines, light aircraft
carriers, and domestically built destroyers. The Air Force
completed its program introducing 40 F-35A fighters by
January 2022 and is also promoting the introduction of


SLBM launch test by the ROK (September 15, 2021) [AFP=Jiji]

domestically built fighters.
In addition, the then Moon Jae-in administration made a
conceptual shift from its “three-axis” system for responding
to nuclear and missile threats from North Korea (“Kill
Chain,” “Korea Air and Missile Defense” (KAMD), and
“Korea Massive Punishment and Retaliation” (KMPR))
to establishing “strategic strike system” and the KAMD.
The scope was also updated from covering the response to
North Korean missile threats to covering the response to
security threats from all directions, though the Yoon Sukyeol has signaled moves to revive the traditional “threeaxis” system.
In regard to the ROK’s missile development, the missile
guidelines agreed upon by the U.S. and ROK governments
in 1979 have placed restrictions on the range and warhead
weights of the ROK’s missiles. However, in November
2017, the ROK government announced that it had revised
the guidelines to eliminate the warhead weight limits on
ballistic missile in order to enhance deterrence against
military provocation by North Korea. Furthermore, at
the May 2021 U.S.-ROK summit meeting, there was an
announcement on the conclusion of the guidelines, which
limited the range of ballistic missiles to 800 km.
In terms of ballistic missiles, the ROK appears to have
operationally deployed Hyunmoo-2 missiles with an
estimated range of 300-800 km and is believed to have
made a successful test launch of Hyunmoo-4 with a twoton warhead weight and 800 km firing range in 2020,
following the abolition of warhead weight limits in the
2017 revision of the missile guidelines. In addition, in
September 2021, the ROK government announced that it
had successfully conducted a test launch of an SLBM from
the Dosan Ahn Changho submarine. By developing and
possessing SLBMs, the ROK is believed to be planning
to augment and diversify its own attack measures with

and to improve survivability.
With regard to cruise missiles, the ROK appears to have
operationally deployed the Hyunmoo-3 surface-to-surface
cruise missile, which is believed to have a range of about
500-1,500 km, and the Haeseong series ship-to-ship/ shipto-surface cruise missiles, which are believed to have a
maximum range of 1,000-1,500 km.
Furthermore, the ROK has been actively exporting
equipment in recent years. It is believed to be diversifying
its export items, including aircraft, naval vessels, selfpropelled artillery guns, and interceptor missiles. In 2017,
the ROK’s exports reached approximately US$3.2 billion
on a contract value basis, about a 13-fold increase over the
11 years since 2006. Since then, although annual export
records have not been published, the number of large
export contracts has been increasing recently, including the
export contract signed with the UAE in January 2022 for
an interceptor missile system, the largest ever for a single
piece of domestically produced equipment (approximately
4.18 trillion Korean won).
Defense spending in FY2022 (regular budget) increased
by about 3.4% from the previous fiscal year to nearly
KRW 54.6112 trillion, marking the 23rd consecutive year
of increases since 2000. According to the Defense Reform
2.0, the ROK will increase the defense budget 7.5% on an


annual average.

See Fig. I-3-4-7 (Changes in the ROK’s Defense Budget)

**4 U.S.-ROK Alliance and U.S. Forces**
**Korea**

The United States and the ROK have taken various steps
to deepen the U.S.-ROK Alliance in recent years. The two
countries regularly confirm the strengthening of the U.S.ROK Alliance at the summit level.
As specific undertakings, the two countries signed the
U.S.-ROK Counter-Provocation Plan for dealing with
North Korea’s provocations in March 2013. They also
approved the Tailored Deterrence Strategy, designed to
enhance deterrence against North Korean nuclear and other
WMD threats, at the 45th Security Consultative Meeting
(SCM) in October of the same year.
At the 46th SCM in October 2014, the two countries
agreed on “Concepts and Principles of ROK-U.S.
Alliance Comprehensive Counter-missile Operations (4D
Operational Concept)” to tackle North Korean ballistic
missile threats. At the 47th SCM in November 2015, the
implementation guidance on the 4D Operational Concept
was approved.
Additionally, after North Korea went ahead with its
nuclear test in January 2016, the Terminal High Altitude

Area Defense (THAAD) was temporarily deployed by
the U.S. Forces Korea in September 2017. In addition,
in a U.S.-ROK summit meeting also held in September,
the enhanced deployment of U.S. strategic assets in and
around the ROK on a rotational basis was agreed.
Recently, at the 53rd SCM in December 2021, the United
States and ROK expanded their Alliance from the Korean
Peninsula and Northeast Asia to the Indo-Pacific region,
approved new Strategic Planning Guidance (SPG) after not
doing so for 11 years, and updated their operation plans
based on the SPG. In regard to this, the United States and
the ROK stated that this reflected “changes to the strategic
environment,” including the North Korean threat. It has
been pointed out that the background includes factors such
as the increasing sophistication of North Korea’s nuclear
and missile capabilities.
On the other hand, in regard to joint U.S.-ROK military
exercises, the United States and the ROK have suspended
large-scale maneuver exercises and reduced the scale of
command exercises since 2018 in response to progress in
dialogue with North Korea.[33] They have also reduced the
scale of and postponed exercises since 2020 due to factors
such as the impact of COVID-19.
Moreover, at the new year press conference in January
2021, then President Moon Jae-in mentioned in relation to
U.S.-ROK joint military training that North Korea would
react sensitively to every exercise, and that it would be
possible to have a discussion with North Korea through
the Inter-Korean Joint Military Committee. However, even
after 2021, regular U.S.-ROK joint command exercises and
other exercises have been conducted on a reduced scale.
At the same time, the two countries have worked to deal
with such issues as the transition of operational control
(OPCON) to the ROK[34] and the realignment of U.S. Forces
Korea.
For the transition of OPCON to the ROK, the roadmap
for the transfer “Strategic Alliance 2015” was established
in October 2010. Aiming to complete the transition by
December 1, 2015, the two countries have reviewed the
approach of transitioning from the existing combined
defense arrangement of the U.S. and ROK Forces, to a
new joint defense arrangement led by the ROK Forces and


supported by the U.S. Forces.
Nevertheless, based on the increasing seriousness of
North Korea’s nuclear and missile threats, the two sides
decided at the 46th SCM to re-postpone the transition of
OPCON, and to adopt a conditions-based approach, i.e.,
implementing the transition when conditions such as the
ROK Forces’ enhanced capabilities are met. At the 50th
SCM in October 2018, it was decided that following the
transition of OPCON, a ROK military officer will serve
as commander of the Future Combined Forces Command,
replacing the current arrangement of a U.S. military officer
serving as the commander of the U.S.-ROK Combined
Forces.
In August 2019, the Initial Operating Capability (IOC)
verification regarding the ROK Forces’ operational
capabilities was conducted during combined command
post exercises. At the 51st SCM in November 2019, the
two parties concurred that the exercise had played an
important role in verifying IOC and decided to pursue an
assessment of Full Operational Capability for the Future
Combined Forces Command in 2020. However, due to the
impact of COVID-19 and other factors, the preliminary
exercise was only conducted in the same year and in 2021.
At the 53rd SCM in December 2021, it was decided that
the FOC assessment would be conducted in 2022.
The ROK Forces plan to enhance and expand early
the military capabilities leading the U.S.-ROK Alliance
and defense capabilities needed to address North Korean
nuclear and missile threat, which are required for the
transition of OPCON, and accelerate the transition of
OPCON through periodic evaluations of readiness.
With regard to the realignment of the U.S. Forces Korea,
an agreement was reached in 2003 on the relocation of the
U.S. Forces’ Yongsan Garrison located in the center of
Seoul to the Pyeontaek area, south of Seoul, and on the
relocation of the U.S. Forces stationed north of the Han
River to the south of the river. Subsequently, however,
the agreement has been partially revised, due to various
factors, including: in relation to the postponement of the
transition of OPCON, it has been necessary for some U.S.
Forces personnel to remain at Yongsan Garrison; and it was
decided that the counter-fires forces of U.S. Forces Korea

33 In regard to “Freedom Guardian” and “Key Resolve,” “new combined command post training” to replace these exercises have been conducted once in both the first and second half of the year
starting in 2019.

34 The United States and the ROK have had the U.S.-ROK Combined Forces Command since 1978 in order to operate the U.S.-ROK combined defense system to deter wars on the Korean Peninsula
and to perform effective combined operations in the case of a contingency. Under the U.S.-ROK combined defense system, OPCON over the ROK Forces is to be exercised by the Chairman of the

would remain in their location north of the Han River
to counter the threat of North Korea’s long-range rocket
artillery.
In July 2017 the U.S. 8th Army headquarters relocated
to the Pyeontaek area, and in June 2018 the headquarters
of U.S. Forces Korea and UN Command also relocated
to the same area. The realignment of U.S. Forces Korea
could have a significant impact on U.S. and ROK defense
postures on the Korean Peninsula, and as such it will be
necessary to follow future developments closely.
Concerning defense burden sharing, whereby the ROK
government bears a portion of the total stationing costs
of the U.S. Forces Korea to ensure a stable stationing
environment, in March 2021, the United States and the
ROK reached an agreement on the 11th Special Measures
Agreement (SMA). This agreement is valid for six years
from 2020 to 2025. The total amount for FY2020 remained
unchanged from the FY2019 level and increased by 13.9%
for FY 2021 compared to FY2020, while for FY2022FY2025 the rate of increase in the ROK defense spending
from the previous year will be applied.

**5 Relations with States and Regions**

**(1) Relations with China**
China and the ROK have made continuous efforts to
strengthen their relations. Meanwhile, outstanding issues
have emerged between China and the ROK. China has
protested that the deployment of THAAD to U.S. Forces
Korea would undermine China’s strategic security interests.
In October 2017 the governments of China and the ROK
announced that they had agreed to utilize military channels
to reach a mutual understanding relating to China’s
concerns about THAAD. In regards to this point, President
Yoon Suk-yeol pledged during the presidential election
to deploy additional THAAD units while stating that he
would achieve a relationship with China that is based on
“mutual respect,” and future developments in China-ROK
relations will be closely watched.

**(2) Relations with Russia**
The ROK and Russia have agreed on cooperation in
the areas of military technology, defense industry, and
military supplies. In June 2018, then-President Moon
Jae-in visited Russia as a state guest, becoming the first
ROK president to do so in 19 years. In August 2018,
defense strategic dialogue was held, and it was agreed
that the dialogue would be upgraded to the vice minister


level. Furthermore, in November 2021, the governments
of the two countries agreed to establish a hotline between
their navies and air forces. Despite these circumstances,
the ROK has implemented sanctions against Russia
and provided military supplies and other resources to
Ukraine in a show of solidarity with the international
community following the Russia’s aggression of
Ukraine since February 2022. On the other hand, the
ROK has also shown a degree of caution, expressing
reluctance to provide anti-aircraft missiles and other
items requested by the Ukrainian side, and it remains
to be seen how the ROK will respond moving forward
in light of the situation in Ukraine as it considers its
relationship with Russia.

**Russia**

**1** **General Situation**

In April 2021, amid reports of a buildup of Russian military
units around Ukraine’s border and the Crimean Peninsula
which was illegally annexed by Russia, President Putin,
who has been seeking the revival of Russia as a strong and
influential power, stated in his annual presidential address to
the Federal Assembly of Russia that “Russia will always find
a way to defend its stance.” Using the new expression “red
line,” he asserted that Russia would not tolerate a situation
in which the core interests of its security were threatened.

**1 Strategic and Policy Documents**


Russia set out its objectives and strategic priorities of
domestic and foreign policies in the “National Security
Strategy” revised in July 2021.
The National Security Strategy states that Russia’s
policies which serve now to strengthen its defense
capabilities, domestic unity, and political stability, and
modernize its economy, and develop its industrial base,
have strengthened Russia as a sovereign state capable of
pursuing an independent domestic and foreign policy and
effectively opposing external pressures. This indicates
Russia’s awareness of the existence of external threats and
its belief that it is a “strong state” that will not succumb to
them. It also states that NATO’s military activities around
Russia are a military threat and that the deployment of U.S.
intermediate- and short-range missiles in Europe and the
Asia-Pacific region is a threat to strategic stability.
In the defense domain, the Strategy commits to giving
continued priority to the role fulfilled by Russia’s military
force, and to ensuring strategic deterrence and preventing
military conflict by maintaining a sufficient level of nuclear
deterrent capability and combat readiness of Russian
military forces, including the Armed Forces of the Russian
Federation (AFRF).
The Military Doctrine, revised in December 2014 as
a document substantiating the principles of the National
Security Strategy in the military sphere, states the existing
view that while the probability of an outbreak of a large-scale
war is decreasing, military risks to Russia are increasing,
such as the movement of NATO’s military infrastructure
closer to Russia’s borders including the expansion of NATO,
and the establishment and deployment of strategic missile
defense (MD) systems. In addition, the doctrine expresses
growing alarm, defining the following as new military risks:
NATO’s military buildup; the realization of the U.S. Global
Strike concept; the rise of global extremism (terrorism); the
formation of governments in neighboring countries that carry


keeping in mind the developments in the invasion of Ukraine.

See Chapter 2, Section 2-2 (The Situation Surrounding Ukraine

after the Spring of 2021)
Chapter 2, Section 3 (How Russia Started an Aggression
against Ukraine and an Outlook on It)

out policies threatening Russia’s interests; and the incitement
of ethnic, social, and religious confrontations in Russia.
In addition, the doctrine raises characteristics of modern
military warfare as being the massive use of precision
weapons, hypersonic weapons, electronic warfare
equipment, all types of autonomous vehicles, and the like,
as well as the phenomena of automation and centralization
of troops and weapon operations through a network of
automatic command and control systems. In addition,
without using the phrase “hybrid warfare,” the doctrine
also points out the integrated use of military force and
political, economic, informational and other non-military
measures, as well as participation in hostilities by irregular
armed groups and private military companies.
The doctrine positions nuclear weapons as an essential
component for preventing the outbreak of nuclear wars
and military conflicts that use conventional weapons.
Regarding the criteria for its use, it states Russia reserves
the right to use nuclear weapons in retaliation not only for
the use of nuclear or other WMDs, but also in the event of
invasion using conventional weapons, where the survival

of the country itself is imperiled.
In June 2020, for the first time, Russia released a policy
document, “Basic Principles of State Policy of the Russian
Federation on Nuclear Deterrence,” which is equivalent to
the so-called nuclear doctrine. Criteria for the use of nuclear
weapons are the same as the criteria described in the military
doctrine, but the document clarifies the conditions for Russia
to newly proceed to the use of nuclear weapons. In the “Basic
Principles,” it is explained that, in addition to the “individual
states [...] that consider the Russian Federation as a potential
adversary,” “military coalitions (blocs, alliances)” in which
these countries participate are also subject to nuclear
deterrence to clarify Russia’s “red lines.”

**2 National Defense Budget**

With regard to Russia’s defense budget, the amounts
executed for FY2011-FY2016 showed year-on-year
double-digit growth and reached 4.4% of GDP. After
that, it has generally remained at a level of around 3%
of GDP.[1]

See Fig. I-3-5-1 (Changes in Russia’s Defense Expenditure)

**3 Military Reform**

Russia has implemented full-scale military reform
since 1997 by presenting the three pillars of reform:
downsizing; modernization; and professionalization.
Regarding the downsizing of the military forces, it was
decided that AFRF would have a strength of one million
personnel as of 2016. Since December 2010, Russia
reorganized its six military districts into four military districts
(Western, Southern, Central and Eastern Districts). On this
basis, Russia established a joint strategic command in each
military district and is carrying out integrated operations of
its entire military forces, such as Land Forces, Navy, and
Aerospace Forces units under the control of the Military
District Commander. In December 2014, the newly established
position of the Northern Joint Strategic Command was given
to the Northern Fleet belonging to the Western District to
develop a joint-operations system in which the ground troops,
the naval vessels, and the air and air defense units facing the
Arctic are operated integrally. Based on this reorganization,
the “four military districts and five Joint Strategic Command”
system had been in operation. After January 2021, however,
the Northern Fleet was designated as an independent military

administration division and given a position equivalent to a
military district, which made the previous system become
the “five military districts and five Joint Strategic Command”
system. This change resulted in the establishment of a system
in which the two aspects of military command and military
administration were in agreement for the entire AFRF.
Regarding the modernization of the military forces,
Russia has achieved its goal of increasing its percentage
of new equipment to 70% by 2020. At the end of 2021,
it was announced that the percentage reached 71% for
conventional forces and 89% for strategic nuclear forces.
Regarding the professionalization of the military forces,
in order to make the combat readiness of the permanent
readiness units effective, Russia promotes the introduction
of a contract service system which selects personnel who
would serve under contracts from the conscripted military
personnel. In 2015, the number of contract servicemen
exceeded the number of conscripted personnel for the first
time, and in 2020 reportedly the former nearly doubled
the latter. On the other hand, with the procurement of new
equipment, the shortage of contract servicemen with expert
knowledge has been suggested.

has been proceeding. At the same time, Russia has
opposed moves by the United States to advance MD
systems domestically and overseas.
Amid such a situation, President Putin at the annual
presidential address to the Federal Assembly of Russia
in March 2018 expressed the view that the MD systems
both in and outside of the United States are being
deployed as a measure in response to ballistic missiles,
which are the foundation of Russian nuclear forces, and
introduced the following five new types of weapons as a
means to breach the MD systems.
・ ICBM “Sarmat,” which is believed to be capable of
attacking targets via the North Pole or the South Pole
with no substantial range limitation

・ Hypersonic glide vehicle (HGV) “Avangard,” which
is claimed to be capable of flying at speeds greater
than Mach 20 in the intercontinental atmosphere

・ Air-launched ballistic missile (ALBM) “Kinzhal,”
which can be attached to MiG-31K fighters

・ Nuclear cruise missile “Burevestnik,” which is capable
of flying at lower altitudes with no substantial range
limitation

・ Nuclear-powered unmanned underwater drone
weapon “Poseidon,” which is claimed to be able to
navigate at high-speed in the deep sea
In 2019, Russia also announced for the first time
that the sea-launched hypersonic cruise missile (HCM)
“Zircon,” which has a believed range of over 1,000km
with the maximum speed of Mach 9, was under
development.
Of these new types of weapons, HGV “Avangard”
and ALBM “Kinzhal” are already deployed, while the
first test flight of the ICBM “Sarmat” was conducted in
April 2022 with deployment begun by the end of 2022.
In December 2021, Defense Minister Shoigu said that
national testing of the HCM “Zircon” was in its final
stages and that a mass-produced version would be
deployed beginning in 2022.

**3 Conventional Forces and Other Issues**

Russia is developing and procuring equipment in
accordance with the State Armaments Program (GPV:
Gosudarstvennaya Programma Vooruzheniya). It is also
moving ahead with the development, procurement, and
deployment of new equipment, such as the “Su-57”
currently under development as the so-called “fifthgeneration fighter” and the “T 14 Armata” tank in

addition to the introduction of the Su-35 fighter and the
surface-to-surface missile system “Iskander.” Russia
has also announced that its Aerospace Forces focus on
the integration with manned aircraft in the development
of unmanned aerial vehicles. Regarding this matter, in
September 2019, the Ministry of Defence of Russia
disclosed images of a cooperative flight test of heavy
unmanned combat aerial vehicle “Okhotnik” and the 5th
generation fighter Su-57. In December 2020, another
cooperative flight of a Tu-95 long-range bomber and
unmanned aerial vehicle was also reported.
In addition, the Russian Navy plans to increase the
rate of modernization of its equipment to 70% by 2027.
Because the replacement of surface vessels for coastal
waters is being completed, the Navy will now move
on to building surface vessels for the open sea. In July
2020, Russia undertook the construction of two of its
first amphibious assault ships, which are expected to be
delivered to the Russian Navy by 2027.

**4 Space and Electromagnetic Domain**

The AFRF has also been stepping up its activities in
the realms of space and electromagnetic spectrum
in recent years. Russia is believed to be promoting
the development of anti-satellite weapons such as the
“Nudol” anti-satellite missile system. In November
2021, Russia announced that it would conduct a satellite
destruction test using an anti-satellite missile. Since 2013,
Russia has put satellites into both low and geostationary
orbits to conduct rendezvous and proximity operations
(RPO), which have repeatedly been observed engaging
in frequent RPO with other countries’ satellites on
geostationary orbits. In July 2020, United States Space
Command (USSPACECOM) announced that there
was proof that Russia had conducted a test of a space

Ground-deployed electronic warfare (EW) system Leer-3

[Official YouTube channel of the Ministry of Defence of Russia]

based anti-satellite weapon in Earth orbit. Commander
General John Raymond at USSPACECOM criticized in
his statement that, “This is further evidence of Russia’s
continuing efforts to develop and test space-based
systems.”
In the electromagnetic domain, since 2009, the
AFRF has established an Electronic Warfare (EW)
Unit, and many new EW systems have been procured
and distributed or allocated to each service and force.
In December 2021, it was announced that the EW Unit
belonging to the Central Military District conducted
an exercise to deceive the enemy by sending fake
commands and signals to conceal the activities of
their own forces. This indicates that the AFRF places
importance on improving electronic warfare capabilities
as a response to “network-centric warfare.”

**5 Trends Related to the AFRF (General)**

Since 2010, the AFRF has been conducting large-scale
round-robin exercises in each military district, with
the objective of verifying the combat readiness of the

military districts, etc. These exercises are helping to
improve the long-distance mobilization capability of the
AFRF. In 2021, the joint strategic exercise “Zapad-2021”
with Belarus was conducted in the Western Military
District with the participation of about 200,000 military
personnel, as well as about 2,000 troops from eight
countries including India and Mongolia.
In February 2022, just prior to the start of the invasion
of Ukraine, a large-scale missile exercise was conducted
across Russia as a “strategic deterrence forces exercise”
using strategic nuclear forces such as ICBMs and
SLBMs as well as missile forces capable of carrying
conventional or tactical nuclear warheads (Iskander,
Kalibr, Kinzhal, and Zircon).
In the Arctic Region, Russia is developing coastal
surveillance radar networks for enhanced vigilance and
surveillance. At the same time, Russia is rebuilding
airfields and deploying Tu-22M medium-range bombers
and MiG-31 interceptor fighters, while also deploying
surface-to-air missiles and surface-to-ship missiles
to develop sufficient preparedness for dealing with
airborne threats from the north and attacks from ships.
Along with these developments, Russia has built a
large-scale residential facility for personnel at the base
in two places within the Arctic Region.
In addition to the development of such military
facilities, the AFRF has also been conducting such
activities as strategic nuclear deterrence patrols by
SSBN and patrol flights by long-range bombers. For
example, Tu-95 and Tu-160 long-range bombers have
frequently been observed flying through international
airspace off the Alaskan coast and over the Barents Sea
and Norwegian Sea.
Against the background of such activities in the
Arctic Region, this region had been attracting attention
from Russia and many other countries due to increased
mining potential of reserve resources and enhanced
usefulness as a sea route identified with sea ice melting
caused by global warming in recent years. For this
reason, Russia has been promoting the system to defend
the national interest in the Arctic Region, and clearly
stating in various policy documents Russia’s rights in
the Arctic Region and the roles of the AFRF in defending
the national interest. For example, in the Strategy for
Developing the Russian Arctic Zone and Ensuring


Russia’s cantonment “Arctic Trefoil” on Alexandra Land [Russian Ministry of Defence]

National Security until 2035, revised in October 2020,
Russia clearly states “ensuring operational system
adequate for the Arctic Circle,” “developing modern
weapons, and military and special equipment suitable
for the Arctic environment,” and “developing base
infrastructure” as specific issues to be addressed in order
to ensure the military security in the Arctic Region.
Russia thus appears to be stepping up military
activities, so close scrutiny of developments in this
regard will be required.
With regard to the development of AFRF pertaining
to the COVID-19 pandemic, when the infections were
spreading, in February 2020 the Russian Ministry of
Defence sent two Aerospace Force’s transport aircraft
carrying CBRN (Chemical, Biological, Radiological,
and Nuclear) experts, military physicians, and virologists
to Wuhan, China, and transported hundreds of people
in addition to Russian citizens to Russia. The AFRF
mobilized more than 30,000 personnel for conducting
infectious disease countermeasures, in which the CBRN
Protection Force carried out disinfection work for
military facilities and other city blocks, and accepted
infected people at military hospitals. Efforts have been
made to increase the number of hospital beds with the
aim of also offering medical support to the private sector,
such as increasing the number of beds of the hospital
ship held by the Pacific Fleet and newly constructing
16 medical centers nationwide. Russia has also carried
out support activities such as transportation of medical
relief goods for other countries. Furthermore, the 48th
Central Scientific Research Institute of the Ministry of
Defence worked with the Gamaleya National Center of

Health and jointly developed Russia’s own “Sputnik V”
COVID-19 vaccine.
At the expanded meeting of the Defence Ministry
Board in December 2021, Defense Minister Shoigu
stated that the vaccination rate of the AFRF was 100%
for military personnel and 70% for civilian staff,
achieving full-scale herd immunity.

**6 Russian Forces in the Vicinity of Japan**

Russia newly established the Eastern Military District
and the Eastern Joint Strategic Command in 2010.
Land Forces, the Pacific Fleet, and the Air Force and
Air Defense Units have been placed under the Military
District Commander, who conducts unified operation of
these services.
The current presence of the AFRF in the Far East
region is significantly smaller than it was at its peak.
However, a considerable scale of military forces,
including nuclear forces, still remains in the region.
Russian armed forces in the vicinity of Japan are
generally increasing activity, including the trend related
to the deployment of new units and military facility.
In recent years, Russia has also been deploying the
latest equipment in the Far East. It announced that the
percentage of new equipment in the Eastern Military
District was 56% as of December 2021.
Given that the AFRF set its basis of operation on
maintaining the combat readiness of its strategic nuclear
units and dealing with conflicts through the inter-theater
mobility of its round-the-clock readiness units, it is
necessary to monitor with concern the positioning and

trends of the AFRF in the Far East region while also
keeping in mind the trends of units in other regions.

**(1) Nuclear Forces**
As for strategic nuclear forces in the Far East region,
one Delta III-class SSBN and two Borey-class SSBNs
equipped with SLBMs are deployed in and around the
Sea of Okhotsk, and approximately 30 Tu-95 long-range
bombers are deployed in Ukrainka. Russia is prioritizing
the reinforcement of its maritime strategic deterrence
posture which had been greatly scaled-down compared
to the former Soviet Union, and as part of these efforts,
it plans on deploying five Borey-class SSBNs to the
Pacific Fleet in the future.

**(2) Ground Forces**
The Eastern Military District now consists of 24
brigades and two divisions with approximately
80,000 personnel in total, including motorized rifles
(mechanized infantry), tanks, artillery, and surface-tosurface missiles, as well as a marine brigade equipped
with amphibious operations capability. The Eastern
Military District has introduced new equipment, such as
the “Iskander” surface-to-surface missile system, “Bal”
and “Bastion” surface-to-ship missiles, and the “S-400”
surface-to-air missile system.

**(3) Naval Forces**
The Pacific Fleet is stationed or deployed at its main
bases in Vladivostok and Petropavlovsk-Kamchatskiy.
The fleet is comprised of approximately 260 ships with
a total displacement in the region of approximately
610,000 tons, including approximately 20 major surface

ships and approximately 20 submarines (approximately
13 of which are nuclear powered submarines) with
a total displacement of approximately 220,000 tons.
In April 2021, the Udaloy-class modernized frigate
“Marshal Shaposhnikov” conducted a test launch of
“Kalibr” cruise missiles in the Sea of Japan for the first
time, and returned to part of the permanent readiness
forces as the first vessel in the Pacific Fleet armed with
“Kalibr” cruise missiles. In addition, in November
2021, the Steregushchiy II-class missile frigate
“Gremyashchiy” carrying “Kalibr” cruise missiles, which
was newly built for the Pacific Fleet, as well as the Kiloclass submarines “Petropavlovsk-Kamchatskiy” and
“Volkhov” were brought around to Vladivostok.

**(4) Air Forces**
In the Eastern Military District, Russia deploys
approximately 320 combat aircraft from its Aerospace
Forces and Navy combined. Existing models are being
modernized and new models, such as the Su-35 fighters
and the Su-34 fighter-bombers, are being introduced to
improve their capabilities.

**(5) Operations in the Vicinity of Japan**
In the vicinity of Japan, the AFRF has been generally
increasing its activities, including exercises and drills
which are believed to be conducted for objectives such
as verifying the results of the military reform.
The number of exercises carried out by the Russian
Land Forces in the areas adjacent to Japan has decreased
from the peak. However, its activities are generally
increasing.
With regard to naval vessels, their activities are
generally increasing in recent years. For example,
various exercises and long-distance voyages have been
carried out by Pacific Fleet vessels, along with patrols
by nuclear-powered submarines. In September 2018,
28 naval vessels including a Slava-class guided missile
cruiser passed through the Soya Strait. This was the
largest number of vessels announced by the Ministry
of Defense (MOD) as having transited this strait at the
same time since the end of the Cold War.
From the end of January to mid-March 2022, a
large-scale maritime exercise, believed to be a part
of the Russian Navy’s whole fleet exercise, was
conducted in the Sea of Okhotsk and other areas with
the participation of more than 20 naval vessels. During
the exercise period a total of 49 vessels including those

not announced as participating in the exercise, sailed
through the Soya and Tsugaru Straits. The exercise was
unique in terms of both its timing and scale. In addition,
given the characteristics of the sea area during the ice
floes season in which the exercise was conducted, it
is clear that it was intended to demonstrate Russia’s
ability to actively operate in the Sea of Okhotsk, which
Russia places importance on as an area of operation for
strategic nuclear-powered submarines. This should be a
subject of concern, considering the series of statements
about the use of nuclear force made by Russia relating
to its invasion of Ukraine. Regarding aircraft, since
the resumption of the patrol activities by its strategic
aviation units in 2007, Russia has been increasing
flights by long range bombers. Also, there were flights
of Tu-95 bombers refueled in mid-flight and supported
by A-50 early warning and control aircraft and Su27 fighters as well as flights of Tu-160. In December
2021, an IL-20 intelligence-gathering aircraft flew from
the Sea of Japan to the Pacific Ocean via the Sea of
Okhotsk, and another eight presumed Russian aircraft
were confirmed to have flown over the Sea of Japan. The
number of scrambles against Russian aircraft increased
from the previous year, and Russian aircraft continued
to be active in 2021, with two incursions into Japanese
airspace, involving SDF aircraft scrambled against the
Russian aircraft, confirmed to have occurred.

**1 General Situation**


Russia considers the realization of its national interests as
a guiding principle of its foreign policy, recognizing the
multipolarization of international relations, the shift of
global power to the Asia-Pacific region, and the growing
importance of force in international relations.[3] Moreover,
based on its National Security Strategy, Russia engages
in open, rational, and pragmatic diplomacy to protect its
national interests, and aims to pursue multidirectional
diplomacy.
Furthermore, Russia aspires to deepen its relations
with the Asia-Pacific countries, seen as drivers of the
global economy, and in recent years, has attached
importance to China and India. Moves to strengthen
collaboration with China in particular have been seen
since the Ukrainian crisis in 2014, seemingly in inverse
proportion to the deepening of Russia’s conflict with
Western countries.

**2 Relations with the United States**

President Putin has striven to deepen cooperative
relations with the United States in the economic domain,
while opposing the United States on any action Russia
considers as “a U.S. attempt to encroach on Russia’s
strategic interests.”
On the military front, feeling that the United States’
installation of missile defense systems both at home
and abroad - including in Europe and the Asia-Pacific

-  undermines global and regional security, Russia has
criticized these moves for upsetting the strategic balance.
Russia is also moving forward with the development of
new strategic weapons that are said to be capable of
reliably penetrating missile defense systems.


Southern Sakhalin, with jurisdiction over units located
on Etorofu and Kunashiri Islands. It is necessary to
monitor with concern the Russian military movements
in the Far East, including the Northern Territories, while
taking into account developments in the invasion of
Ukraine.

However, since the United States suspended
military exchanges with Russia in March 2014 over
the Ukrainian crisis, there have been frequent instances
of both countries’ aircraft and ships coming into close
proximity with each other. In November 2020, U.S.
Navy’s guided-missile destroyer transited in the vicinity
of Peter the Great Bay off the coast of Vladivostok,
Russian Far East, against which the Russian Ministry
of Foreign Affairs in a statement criticized the U.S.
vessel’s intrusion into the Russian territorial waters
as “public provocation.” Since the time of the Soviet
Union, Russia has been claiming this Bay as its internal
waters under international law, while the United States
refutes that the water the U.S. vessel navigated is not the
Russian territorial water.
In regard to arms control between the United States
and Russia, the Intermediate-Range Nuclear Forces
(INF) Treaty ended in August 2019 during the former
Trump administration after having gone through a
series of processes originating from the withdrawal
announcement of the U.S. side. In November 2020, the
United States pulled out of the Open Skies Treaty, which
was signed by the Western countries and Russia allowing
its participants to mutually conduct unarmed observation
and surveillance flights, and this was followed by Russia
announcing its withdrawal in January 2021.
On the other hand, with regard to the New START
Treaty (Strategic Arms Reduction Treaty), which set the
upper limit of strategic nuclear forces for Russia and the
United States, President Putin and newly inaugurated
President Biden of the United States agreed on its
unconditional extension for five years during their first
telephone talk in January 2021, just before the expiration
of the treaty in February of the same year.

**5 Relations with Other Countries**

**(1) Relations with Asian Countries**
Russia recognizes that the significance of the AsiaPacific region is increasing within its multi-pronged
foreign policy, and considers it strategically important to
strengthen its status in the region from the viewpoint of
socioeconomic development in Siberia and the Far East,
and security. In Asia, in addition to its relations with
China, Russia assigns an important role to its Special
and Privileged Strategic Partnership with India. In
December 2021, in conjunction with the annual summit
meeting, the inaugural 2+2 Dialogue of the Foreign
and Defence Ministers was held in New Delhi. As for
military arrangements, another example of the ongoing
wide-ranging military cooperation between Russia and
India is the joint exercise “INDRA,” which has been
taking place since 2003 with the involvement of the
armies and navies of both countries, with their air forces
also taking part in the recent years. Furthermore, Russia
is working to strengthen its relations with ASEAN, and
conducted the Naval Cooperative Exercise with ASEAN
countries firstly in the inshore waters of Indonesia in
December 2021.

**(2) Relations with European Countries**
Through the framework of the NATO-Russia Council
(NRC), Russia has worked with NATO as an equal
partner in the areas of common interest, such as by
participating in certain decision-making processes.
However, following the Ukrainian crisis in 2014,
NATO and European countries suspended their practical
cooperation with Russia thereafter, including that in the
military domain, except for the NRC’s ambassadorlevel meetings.
In October 2021, NATO expelled members of
Russia’s mission to the alliance on the grounds that they
were actually intelligence officers. In response, Russia’s
Ministry of Foreign Affairs announced the suspension
of activities of its mission to NATO and of the alliance’s
related office in Moscow.
In January 2022, the NRC meeting was held for the
first time in nearly two years regarding the buildup of
Russian military forces around Ukraine and elsewhere.


**4** **Relations with Former Soviet Republics**

Russia positions the development of bilateral and
multilateral cooperation with former Soviet republics
as one of its most important foreign policy objectives.
Russia considers that its vital interests are concentrated
in the region. It deploys its troops in the Collective
Security Treaty Organization (CSTO)[4] members
Armenia, Tajikistan, and Kyrgyzstan, as well as Moldova
(Transnistria), Georgia (South Ossetia, Abkhazia),
and Ukraine (Crimea). Through the conclusion of an
alliance and strategic partnership treaty with Abkhazia
in November 2014, the conclusion of an alliance and
integration treaty with South Ossetia in 2015, and other
efforts, Russia has been working to ensure its military
influence.
However, in recent years following three decades
after the collapse of the Soviet Union, a situation has
arisen that could be interpreted as being the gradual
decrease of Russia’s influence over the former Soviet
bloc. Particularly, in the Nagorno-Karabakh conflict
which saw an outbreak of large-scale fighting in 2020,
Russia’s response was limited to leading a ceasefire
agreement and dispatching peacekeeping troops because
although Armenia, one of the parties involved in the
conflict, has a military alliance with Russia, the fighting
did not directly involve Armenian territory in the current
conflict. In addition, Georgia, Ukraine, and Moldova
are oriented toward the path of European integration.
In particular, Georgia and Ukraine are making progress
in cooperation with NATO with the aim of becoming
members.
In Central Asia, Russia conducted a joint exercise in
Uzbekistan with that country in August 2021, as well
as a joint exercise in Tajikistan with Uzbekistan and
Tajikistan. Russia has explained that the background for
these exercises was the destabilization of the situation in
Afghanistan. In addition, in January 2022, at the request
of Kazakhstan, the CSTO collective peacekeeping
forces, led by Russia’s Airborne Forces, were dispatched
in response to the expansion and intensification of
protests.



Chapter 2 (Russia’s Aggression against Ukraine)


See


CSTO is a military alliance consisting of six member states, namely Russia, Belarus, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Tajikistan, and Armenia. Article 4 of the 1992 Collective Security Treaty, which is the
grounds for establishing the Collective Security Treaty Organization (CSTO), states that, “In the event of an act of aggression against any of the participating States, all other participating States
will provide them with the necessary assistance, including military, and will also provide support at their disposal in exercising the right to collective defense in accordance with Article 51 of the

Securing naval bases in Sudan, in addition to Tartus in
Syria, will enhance the AFRF’s deployment capabilities
further afield.
Furthermore, in January 2022, the Malian military
spokesman stated that Russian instructors had been
dispatched to the country under a bilateral agreement
to train Mali’s military, and it is noted that 300 to 400
personnel of the Russian PMC Wagner Group have been
operating inside Mali.

**6 Arms Exports**

Russia actively promotes the export of arms not only
to maintain the infrastructure of its military industry
and to make economic profit, but also to help promote
better foreign policy. Export control is exclusively
conducted by the Rosoboronexport State Corporation.
In addition, Russia is working to improve the efficiency
of its production system by promoting the integration of
aircraft companies such as Sukhoi, MiG, and Tupolev.
Currently, Russia has the third largest share of arms
exports in the world after the United States and France,[5]
exporting fighters, vessels and surface-to-air missiles
to countries including Asia, Africa, and Middle East. In
recent years, Russia has been aggressively marketing its
arms to allies and partners of the United States, including
Turkey and Saudi Arabia, in addition to traditional
export destinations. In particular, the export of S-400
to Turkey, a member country of NATO, was met with
strong opposition from the United States. Russia is
also expanding its sales activities to Southeast Asian
countries such as Vietnam, Malaysia, and Myanmar.

**(3) Relations with Middle Eastern and African**
**Countries**

Since September 2015, while acquiring Tartus Naval
Base and Khmeimim Air Base as bases of its operations
in Syria, the Russian military, which was carrying out
military operations to support the Assad administration
in Syria, has conducted aerial bombing using fighterbombers and long-range bombers as well as cruise
missiles from surface vessels and submarines deployed
to the Caspian Sea and Mediterranean.
Operations in Syria using cruise missiles and strategic
bombers have provided the ideal setting to demonstrate
Russia’s long-range precision strike capabilities. It has
been pointed out that Russia maintains a military presence
in Syria and is building permanent “A2/AD” capabilities
by deploying long-range surface-to-air missiles, as well
as expanding cooperation with neighboring countries
such as Turkey, Iran, and Egypt. Taking this into account,
Russian influence over the eastern Mediterranean region,
especially Syria, cannot be ignored.
Russia is increasing its influence over both the Syrian
situation and peace in Libya, while at the same time
coordinating its interests with Turkey. In May 2020, the
United States Africa Command (AFRICOM) announced
that Russian MiG-29 fighters were delivered to Libya
after military aircraft insignia had been removed in
Syria, and accused Russia’s involvement in creating the
war situation in Libya using private military companies
(PMC) that the Russian government supports.
AFRICOM also mentioned the possibility of extremely
serious security concern arising in southern European
countries, if Russia establishes a base on the coast of
Libya and develops permanent “A2/AD” capabilities in
the area. It has also been reported that approximately
1,200 personnel from the Russian PMC Wagner Group
were dispatched and on duty in Libya.
In October 2019, Russia held the first Russia-Africa
Summit in Sochi and also dispatched two Tu-160 strategic
bombers to South Africa under a military cooperation
agreement that it had signed with South Africa in 1995.
In December 2020, the Russian government announced
an agreement with the government of Sudan to set up a

they released a fact sheet that detailed the progress in
their efforts to acquire the nuclear-powered submarine
capabilities as well as the deepening of cooperation
in additional areas such as the undersea robotics
autonomous systems, quantum technologies, artificial
intelligence, and hypersonic capabilities. In addition,
Australia has announced its intention to advance
cooperation with the United States on the introduction of
Tomahawk cruise missiles, standoff missiles (JASSMER and LRASM), and precision strike-guided missiles
for the Army, which are believed to have a range of over
400 km, as well as for the development of hypersonic
missiles for the Air Force.

**3 Relations with Other Countries**

**(1) Relations with the United States**
The Australia-U.S. alliance was formalized through the
Security Treaty between Australia, New Zealand and
the United States of America (ANZUS).[2] In the 2020
Defence Strategic Update, the Australian Government
clearly states that they will continue to deepen the
alliance acknowledging that the alliance with the United
States, including intelligence sharing and defense
industrial and technological cooperation, is critical.
Since 1985, the two countries have been regularly
convening the Australia-United States Ministerial
Consultations (AUSMIN) to discuss major diplomatic
and security issues.
In the Joint Statement of the AUSMIN held in
Washington, D.C. in September 2021, the United
States and Australia reaffirmed their determination
to continue to advance regional peace, security, and
prosperity in order to ensure an open, inclusive, and
resilient Indo-Pacific region, as well as to cooperate
through the AUKUS and Quad frameworks. The two
countries also reiterated their continued support for
a peaceful resolution of the issues between China
and Taiwan without resorting to threats or coercion.
They also expressed concern over China’s expansive
maritime claims in the South China Sea that had no


legal basis, called for the proper implementation of
China’s domestic legislation, including the Maritime
Traffic Safety Law, in a manner consistent with the UN
Convention on the Law of the Sea, and reiterated that
the 2016 Arbitral Tribunal’s Award as to the dispute
between the Philippines and China was final and legally
binding.
The military forces of the United States and Australia
are striving to improve interoperability through bilateral
exercises.
Exercise Talisman Sabre is the Australia-U.S.
bilateral exercise conducted biennially since 2005,
with the objective of enhancing combat readiness
and interoperability. In 2021, amphibious landings
and ground force maneuver were conducted by the
Australian and U.S. forces, with the participation of the
Canadian, British, and ROK forces, the SDF of Japan,
and others.
The United States and Australia have increased
the presence of the U.S. Forces in northern Australia,
which is located near the Indo-Pacific. Based on the
Force Posture Initiatives announced in November 2011,
the U.S. Marine Corps began rotational deployment
in northern Australia in 2012, which resulted in
approximately 1,000 Marines deployed in the region
in 2020.[3] In addition, U.S. Air Force B-52 strategic
bombers and F-22 fighters have been deployed to
Australia as needed to participate in training. Global
Posture Review released by the U.S. DoD in November
2021 specified the rotational deployment of U.S.
military aircraft to Australia and the enhancement of
infrastructure in Australia.

**(2) Relations with China**
For Australia, China is the biggest trade partner, and the
two countries have had exchanges in the defense area
such as dialogues between the defense authorities, joint
exercises, and mutual visiting of vessels, in addition to
exchanges and cooperation in the political and economic
areas.
Meanwhile, Australia has been openly showing
its wariness toward China including by delivering
Australia’s stance on China clearly.


Australia had planned to procure 12 conventional submarines (attack-class submarines) from France, but this plan was suspended when Australia decided to acquire nuclear-powered submarines
within the framework of the AUKUS.

A trilateral security treaty among Australia, New Zealand, and the United States, which went into effect in 1952. Since 1986, the United States has suspended its obligation to defend New Zealand
due to its adoption of a non-nuclear policy. The treaty is thus effective only between Australia and the United States and between Australia and New Zealand.


**Chapter**

The Australian Government has been expressing
strong concerns over China’s land reclamation and
construction activities in the South China Sea, and
called on all claimant states to halt militarization,
while also clearly expressing its intention to continue
to exercise its rights to freedom of navigation and
overflight. Furthermore, the 2017 Foreign Policy White
Paper contained statements to the effect that China was
challenging the position of the United States in the IndoPacific, the most important region for Australia.
People within and outside Australia expressed their
concerns over the acquisition by Chinese businesses
of Australian facilities, including Port Darwin, a port
that has been used by the Australian and United States
fleets among others. In January 2017, the Government
announced the establishment of the Critical Infrastructure
Centre to serve as a dedicated body for advising related
institutions in order to block the sale of important
infrastructure related to national security, including
specific ports and harbor facilities, to companies from
other countries. The Centre manages the risks arising
from foreign involvement by assessing the risks of
sabotage, espionage and coercion in Australia’s critical
infrastructure sectors, including telecommunications,
electricity, gas, water and ports.
With China’s perceived influence on Australia
growing larger, including cases of political figures and
parties receiving huge political contributions and bribes,
the Australian Parliament also passed a bill to prevent
interference in domestic affairs by foreign actors.
There has been friction between the two countries
concerning the spread of COVID-19, including China’s
successive restrictions on importing Australian beef and
other goods since Australia suggested the necessity for an
independent investigation into the origin of COVID-19.
It is also pointed out that the conflict between China
and Australia is worsening in relation to the human
rights issue in Hong Kong and Uighurs. Furthermore,
regarding the defense of Taiwan, Australian Defense
Minister Dutton stated in November 2021 that it would
be inconceivable for Australia not to support the United
States if it chose to take action.
China has criticized the establishment of AUKUS,
claiming that the provision of technology related to
nuclear submarines to Australia is destructive to regional
peace and stability.
In addition, on February 19, 2022, the Australian
Department of Defence announced that a P 8APoseidon


of the Australian Air Force had detected a laser beam
emanating from a Chinese naval vessel in the Arafura
Sea on February 17 of the same year. On February 20,
Australian Prime Minister Morrison condemned the
laser beam as “an act of intimidation” that Australia
would never accept. In response, the Chinese Ministry
of National Defense and Ministry of Foreign Affairs
opposed this, stating that Australia’s claims were
“untrue.”

**(3) Relations with India**
Australia sees India as a key security partner.
At the Australia-India summit meeting (held online)
in June 2020, the two countries agreed to elevate the
bilateral relationship to a Comprehensive Strategic
Partnership. The two leaders announced that both
countries share the vision of “an open, free, rules-based
Indo-Pacific region,” and released the Joint Declaration
on a Shared Vision for Maritime Cooperation in the
Indo-Pacific.
In addition, in September 2021, the two countries
held their inaugural India-Australia 2+2 Ministerial
Dialogue in New Delhi. In the Joint Statement, the two
countries agreed to cooperate comprehensively in a
wide range of fields, including defense, maritime affairs,
climate change, cyber, space, counterterrorism, and the
economy. Particularly in the defense field, they agreed
to strengthen cooperation in defense technologies,
maritime domain awareness, and operational logistics
support.
From August to October 2021, the Royal Australian
Navy participated in the Multilateral Exercise Malabar
between the U.S. Navy, Indian Navy, and the Japan
Maritime Self-Defense Force (JMSDF), as it did in
2020.

Defence Cooperation Arrangement, which included
the enhancement of cooperation in the fields of antiterrorism measures and maritime security. The two
countries’ cooperative relations in the security and
defense fields had stalled intermittently. However, since
mutual visits by ministers and higher-level officials
resumed, the bilateral relationship has been improving
through initiatives, including regular Foreign and
Defense Ministers Meetings (2+2) and the signing of an
agreement on maritime security and terrorism, and of a
Maritime Cooperation Plan of Action in 2018.

shelters, hygiene products, and telecommunications
equipment, in cooperation with other countries,
including New Zealand and Japan. In addition, in the
field of maritime patrol, Australia regularly deploys
ADF assets to the South Pacific to assist with patrol
activities. It also plans to supply the Pacific Island
countries and Timor-Leste with 21 new Guardian-class
patrol boats by 2023. In May 2019, immediately after

priorities, including capabilities to operate effectively

Moreover, the Statement was the first document that
mentioned the impact of climate change and the role of
the New Zealand Defence Force (NZDF) regarding the
climate issue, which reflected the new administration’s
Pacific Reset strategy, and committed to support the
Pacific Island countries that have been exposed to
disasters. As for the issues in the South China Sea, the
Statement specifically noted the China’s militarization
in the South China Sea, stating, “China’s more confident
assertion of its interests has at times raised tensions with
neighboring states and with the United States.”
In addition, New Zealand released the Defence
Assessment 2021 in December 2021, which analyzed
the country’s strategic environment and provided a
review of the challenges and other issues, suggesting
that the construction of military facilities and unilateral
resource development, as seen in the South China
Sea, could occur in the island country region, too. The
Assessment also identified strategic competitions as one
of New Zealand’s security challenges, noting that while
the rise of China was the major driver, other countries
were also involved in strategic competitions to varying
degrees.
As for diplomatic relations, New Zealand has
maintained close relationships with the United States
and Australia based on the ANZUS Treaty, and sees
Australia as its closest partner. In the joint statement of
the May 2021 Australia-New Zealand summit meeting,
serious concerns were expressed about the situation
in the South China Sea, including the continued
militarization of disputed features and intensification
of destabilizing activities. The Joint Statement also
expressed that China should respect the human rights of
the Uyghur people, and should grant the United Nations
and other independent observers access to the region.
The United States has suspended its defense obligation
to New Zealand in 1985, when New Zealand refused the
entrance of a U.S. ship following its nuclear-free policy.
Nevertheless, the two countries have strengthened
their relationship in the diplomacy and defense fields
through the Wellington Declaration (2010), which
primarily focuses on strengthening strategic relations


in the fields of foreign policy and military affairs, and
the Washington Declaration (2012), which mainly
deals with expanding defense cooperation. The United
States has thus become a very close strategic partner
for New Zealand. While New Zealand has deepened
its relationship with China through such initiatives as
cooperation for the Belt and Road Initiative and joint air
exercises, it also looks at China with a cautious eye as
shown in the Strategic Defence Policy Statement 2018
and Defence Assessment 2021.
The NZDF has 9,400 personnel.[4] It has contributed
to the peace and stability of the region through such
activities as engaging in monitoring and surveillance
activities by patrol aircraft against illegal maritime
activities, including illicit ship-to-ship transfers
involving North Korean-flagged vessels, and dispatching
its personnel to the United Nations Command Military
Armistice Commission (UNCMAC) in the ROK, and
to other operations in the Middle East and the South
Pacific.
In June 2019, the New Zealand Government
published the Defence Capability Plan 2019, which set
out planned investments of NZ$20 billion until 2030.
Investments under the Plan include strengthening of
relations with the Pacific Island countries; responding to
climate change; and acquisition of vessels, helicopters,
transport aircraft and more to strengthen the maritime
surveillance capability.
In the wake of the undersea volcanic eruption off
the coast of Tonga in January 2022 and the ensuing
earthquake and tsunami damage, C-130 transport
aircraft were dispatched to transport relief supplies,
including food, hygiene products, and first-aid kits, in
cooperation with other countries, including Australia
and Japan.

In August 2021, foreign ministers of Indonesia and
the U.S. had a bilateral strategic dialogue to discuss
international situations. Furthermore, Indonesian
Minister of Defence Prabowo and U.S. Secretary of
Defense Austin discussed military exercises and security
cooperation between their countries during the Manama
Dialogue held in Bahrain in November 2021.

**2 Malaysia**

Malaysia’s first defense white paper, which was
published in December 2019, finds its potential to
serve as a bridge between the vast Pacific and Indian
Oceans as the country is divided in two territories—
Peninsular Malaysia, and Sabah and Sarawak, on the
island of Borneo—located between the two oceans.
The white paper also recognizes the fact that, while
Malaysia’s strategic location and natural resources are
blessing, they also pose a security challenge to itself.
Given these attributes, Malaysia has historically been
affected by the political dynamics of major powers, and
even today, Malaysia sees in its defense white paper that
uncertain U.S.-China relationship is the most important
strategic challenge for Malaysia. Moreover, the white
paper also recognizes that Malaysia faces increasing
non-traditional security threats such as terrorism,
cyberthreats, piracy, and natural disasters.
Based on this recognition, the white paper set up three
pillars in order to defend national interests in each of
three concentric areas, consisting of the Core Area, which
includes both the country’s land masses and territorial
waters; the Extended Area, which encompasses the
surrounding waters and airspace; and the Forward Area,
which incorporates locations beyond the extended area
where Malaysia’s national interests are affected. The
three pillars are: (1) Concentric Deterrence, which aims
to dissuade all forms of external intrusion or conflicts
by strengthening the capability of the nation’s armed
forces; (2) Comprehensive Defense, which seeks to
enhance Malaysia’s internal resilience by whole-ofgovernment and whole-of-society approaches; and (3)


Credible Partnerships, which focuses on the promotion
of regional stability via the expansion and enhancement
of defense cooperation with other countries as a highly
credible partner.
In connection with the recent continued anchoring
of Chinese vessels around South Luconia Shoal, over
which Malaysia claims sovereignty, Malaysia has
announced that its Navy and maritime law enforcement
agencies would conduct around-the-clock monitoring,
and that Malaysia would defend its sovereignty. In
June 2021, the Malaysian Air Force announced that 16
Chinese military aircraft had flown over the Shoal and
approached as far as the Malaysian coast. In October
of the same year, a Chinese survey vessel and other
vessels entered Malaysia’s EEZ, which the Malaysian
government protested against.
Along with this expression of protest and
strengthening of its maritime defense capabilities,
Malaysia also has striven to bolster its defense posture
in eastern Malaysia, constructing a new naval base in
April 2017 in Bintulu, close to James Shoal and South
Luconia Shoal. In July 2019, the Air Force carried out
live-fire missile exercises in Sabah state, on Borneo in
eastern Malaysia.
Since December 2019, Malaysia also has been
confirming Chinese ships’ activities around its own
drillship West Capella.
In April 2020, the United States and Australia carried
out joint exercises in the area surrounding the West
Capella, and in May 2020, U.S. Littoral Combat Ship
(LCS) also conducted presence operations near the West
Capella.
In addition, as well as conducting bilateral/multilateral
exercises with the United States such as “CARAT” and
“SEACAT,” Malaysia has been promoting military
cooperation including capacity building in the maritime
security field.

**3 Myanmar**

Myanmar shares borders with China and India, and
is a gateway to the Indian Ocean for China and some
ASEAN countries. In light of these factors, Myanmar
is noted for its strategic significance. In Myanmar,
the armed forces had control over the government

following the collapse of the socialist regime in 1988.
However, with an economic slowdown caused by the
economic sanctions imposed by the West, the transition
to civilian rule was completed based on the road map to
democracy.
In November 2020, Myanmar’s parliamentary
election was held for the first time in five years and
the ruling National League for Democracy (NLD)
secured an overwhelming single majority in both the
upper and lower houses. However, in February 2021,
State Counsellor Aung San Suu Kyi and her party’s
senior members were detained by Myanmar’s military,
which was claiming election fraud, and the armed forces
declared a state of emergency to carry out a coup d’état,
and powers were handed over to the commander-inchief. The State Administration Council (SAC) chaired
by Commander-in-Chief of the Myanmar Armed Forces
Min Aung Hlaing was formed by the military. The
Armed Forces controlled information and used force
to suppress civil disobedience movements and protests
against their administration, resulting in numerous
casualties. This unleashed a storm of condemnation and
concern from the international society.
Then, in April of the same year, although the
Committee Representing Pyidaungsu Hluttaw (CRPH)
instituted by Pro-Democracy Group declared the
establishment of the National Unity Government
(NUG), the Armed Forces designated them and others
as terrorist organizations. After the ASEAN Leaders’
Meeting held the same month with the presence of a
Myanmar military representative, the Chairperson issued
a statement expressing deep concern on the situation in
the country including the increasing number of victims
and the escalation of violence. During this meeting, a
“Five-Point Consensus” was agreed to, recognizing
ASEAN’s proactive and constructive role in promoting
a peaceful resolution. The five items were as follow: (1)
First, there shall be immediate cessation of violence in
Myanmar and all parties shall exercise utmost restraint;
(2) Second, constructive dialogue among all parties
concerned shall commence to seek a peaceful solution
in the interests of the people; (3) Third, a special envoy
of the ASEAN Chair shall facilitate mediation of the
dialogue process, with the assistance of the Secretary
General of ASEAN; (4) Fourth, ASEAN shall provide
humanitarian assistance through the AHA Centre; and
(5) Fifth, the special envoy and delegation shall visit
Myanmar to meet with all parties concerned In August

[ASEAN]

of the same year, SAC announced the establishment of
an “interim government” with Commander-in-Chief of
the Myanmar Armed Forces Min Aung Hlaing as the
“provisional prime minister.”
And during an ASEAN Foreign Ministers Meeting in
the same month, it was agreed to appoint Mr. Erywan,
the second minister of foreign affairs of Brunei, as a
special envoy to Myanmar.
Following this, however, the conflict between the
Armed Forces and pro-democracy groups intensified
with numerous casualties, and no meeting between
the special envoy and concerned parties materialized.
In October of the same year, an Emergency ASEAN
Foreign Ministers’ Meeting was held on the situation in
Myanmar, after which the Statement of the Chair was
issued stating that ASEAN would invite a non-political
representative from Myanmar to the upcoming ASEAN
Summits and Related Summits. The Myanmar Armed
Forces strongly rejected this decision and did not attend
the Summit Meeting held in the same month.
Myanmar has maintained a good relationship with
China since the two countries established diplomatic
relations in 1950 and the country is regarded as a
major supplier of equipment. Myanmar has also
received Chinese aid for pipeline construction and
the development of Kyaukpyu Port. In January 2020,
President Xi Jinping became the first Chinese leader to
visit Myanmar for 19 years and affirmed China’s policy
of promoting economic cooperation through the BRI.
Myanmar has maintained a cooperative relationship
with Russia in the military field since the period of the
past military regime, and Russia was a destination for
students from Myanmar and a supplier of major defense
equipment. As for India, since the transition to civilian
rule Myanmar has deepened cooperative relations in


**Chapter**
**3**


-----

the fields of the economy and military, which resulted in
defense cooperation and exchanges such as the hosting
of various seminars and friendly visits to Myanmar by
Indian naval vessels.
Cooperative relations with North Korea, including
weapons trades, were maintained under Myanmar’s
military regime in the past. Following the transition to
democracy, although Myanmar denied its military ties to
North Korea, the report issued by the Panel of Experts of
the UN Security Council Sanctions Committee on North
Korea in March 2018 reported that the country has
received a ballistic missile system and other weapons
from North Korea.

**4 The Philippines**

The Philippines considers that its archipelagic attributes
and geographic location are a source of both strength
and vulnerability. Moreover, the country sees that its
strategic location and rich natural resources have also
provided a strong temptation to expansionist powers.
Based on this perception, although resolving internal
armed conflicts remains its top security concern, rising
tensions in the South China Sea have prompted the
Philippines to give the same attention to territorial
defense as it does to internal security threats.
The Philippines, with a historically close relationship
with the United States, has maintained a cooperative
relationship with the United States under their mutual
defense treaty and military assistance agreement, even
after the withdrawal of the U.S. Forces in 1992. The
two countries conduct a number of bilateral exercises,
including Balikatan, KAMANDAG, and Maritime
Training Activity Sama Sama. In March 2016, the
two countries agreed on five locations for carrying
out defense cooperation under the Enhanced Defense
Cooperation Agreement (EDCA) they signed in April
2014 for strengthening cooperation in such areas as
the capacity enhancement of the Armed Forces of
the Philippines and disaster relief. The five locations
are Antonio Bautista Air Base, Basa Air Base, Fort
Magsaysay, Lumbia Air Base, and Mactan-Benito
Ebuen Air Base. Furthermore, the Government of the
Philippines notified in February 2020 its intention to
terminate the Visiting Forces Agreement (VFA), which
prescribed the legal status of U.S. military personnel
when U.S. Forces conducts bilateral/multilateral
military exercises or other activities in the Philippines


However, in July 2021, the Philippines President Duterte
decided to withdraw the notice. In addition, cooperative
relations of the two countries in the region have been
strengthened as shown by the event that during the U.S.Philippines defense ministers’ meeting in September
2021, Secretary of Defense Austin stated that the United
States’ commitments under the U.S.-Philippines Mutual
Defense Treaty extend to the Philippine armed forces,
public vessels, and aircraft in the South China Sea.
The Philippines and China have competing claims
over the sovereignty in the Spratly Islands and
Scarborough Shoal of the South China Sea. In January
2013, seeking a settlement under international law,
the Philippines started arbitral tribunal proceedings
pursuant to UNCLOS against China. In July 2016,
the final award was rendered, accepting nearly all of
the Philippines’ submissions. The Government of the
Philippines released a statement that it welcomed the
award by the arbitral tribunal and strongly affirmed its
respect for the decision. Also, President Duterte stated
in his State of the Nation Address held in the same
month that the Philippines would strongly affirm and
uphold the award handed down for the arbitration case
between the Philippines and China.
The Philippines has been advocating peaceful
resolution of international conflicts based on
international laws including United Nations Convention
on the Law of the Sea. In April 2019, the Philippines
criticized China when it confirmed the presence of more
than 200 Chinese vessels near and around Thitu Island
(Filipino name: Pag-asa Island), which is under the
effective control of the Philippines.
In addition, the conflicts between the Philippines and
China over the South China Sea dispute were observed
even after 2020 when the COVID-19 infections became
a global pandemic. The Philippines protested against
China that a Chinese military vessel had directed firecontrol radars at a Philippine Navy ship in February
2020, and that China had established administrative
districts on islands in the South China Sea in April of
the same year. In July 2020, responding to China’s
announcement of its plan to conduct military training
in the South China Sea, Secretary of Foreign Affairs.
Teodoro Locsin expressed his concerns in a video.
Moreover, regarding the fact that “220 Chinese militia
ships were confirmed in the South China Sea” in
March 2021, the Department of National Defense of
the Philippines accused China of conducting “a clear


**Chapter**
**3**


-----

provocation of the militarization of the South China
Sea, and demanded China to remove ships. In response,
the Chinese side claimed its sovereignty over Whitsun
Reef, and then denied the existence of Chinese militia
ships and explained that “some fishing ships had to
shelter at Whitsun Reef from the bad weather.”
Furthermore, in November 2021, the Philippine
Foreign Minister issued a statement of protest about
obstruction of work caused by the use of a water cannon
by Chinese Coast Guard vessels against supply vessels
that were working to supply the Philippine military in
the Spratly Islands. The U.S. Department of State issued
a news statement in response to this, emphasizing its
intention to invoke U.S.-Philippines Mutual Defense
Treaty in case of an armed attack on Philippines public
vessels in South China Sea.

See Chapter 4, Section 5-1 (Trends Related to the “Principle of

See

the Freedom of the High Seas”)

**5 Singapore**

Given its limited land area, population, and resources,
Singapore’s existence and development depend on
the peace and stability of the region in a globalized
economy. Therefore, Singapore gives high priority to
national defense, with defense spending accounting for
about one-fifth of its national budget.
Singapore identifies deterrence and diplomacy as
twin pillars of its national defense policy. Because it is
a very small country, Singapore’s armed forces make
use of the training facilities of other countries, including
the United States and Australia, while continually
dispatching military personnel to take part in training
exercises overseas.
Singapore emphasizes the importance of cooperative
relations of ASEAN and the FPDA,[3] and has concluded
defense cooperation agreements with countries within
and outside the region. With the aim of contributing to
peace and stability in the region, Singapore supports
U.S. presence in the Asia-Pacific and permits it to use
military facilities in Singapore. Since 2013, U.S. littoral
combat ships (LCSs) began their rotational deployments.
In December 2015, the P-8 patrol aircraft of the U.S.
Forces were deployed to Singapore for around one week
for the first time. The two countries have committed to


continuing to carry out similar deployments routinely.
In addition, Singapore conducts bilateral/multilateral
exercises with the United States, such as CARAT and
SEACAT. In September 2019, the two countries signed
the Protocol of Amendment to the 1990 Memorandum
of Understanding Regarding United States Use of
Facilities in Singapore to extend the MOU. In July
2021, U.S. Secretary of Defense Austin talked with
Singapore Defense Minister Ng Eng Hen in Singapore
and reaffirmed the relationship of defense cooperation
between the two countries’ militaries emphasizing the
United States’ commitment to Southeast Asia region
together with the U.S. Vice President Harris’s visit in
August of the same year.
Singapore has strong economic ties with China, and
the two countries also conduct bilateral naval exercises.
In October 2019, the two countries signed the enhanced
Agreement on Defence Exchanges and Security
Cooperation (ADESC). On the other hand, diplomatic
relations with China have been strained partly due to
Singapore’s advocacy of the arbitration award when it
comes to the resolution of the South China Sea disputes
and partly due to Singapore’s defense cooperation with
Taiwan.
Singapore concluded the Bilateral Agreement for
Navy Cooperation with India in November 2017 and
the two countries undertake Exercise Bold Kurukshetra,
a bilateral army exercise, and the Singapore India
Maritime Bilateral Exercise (SIMBEX). In addition,
Singapore, India, and Thailand held their first trilateral
exercise in September 2019, which took place near the
Andaman Islands.
In March 2020, Singapore and Australia signed
the Treaty on Military Training and Training Area
Development in Australia. This treaty enables the
Singapore Armed Forces to access Australia’s newly
developed training area.

increasing the readiness of the Royal Thai Armed Forces
(RTAF) and developing the defense industry.
Under its flexible omni-directional diplomatic policy,
Thailand pursues cooperation with other Southeast
Asian countries and coordination with major countries.
Exercise Cobra Gold, which is co-sponsored by the U.S.
and Thailand and has been implemented since 1982,
is currently one of the largest multilateral training in
Southeast Asia.
In addition, the Marine Corps of the two countries
have continued their bilateral/bilateral naval training
CARAT and counter-piracy and trafficking exercise
SEACAT.
Thailand and China have conducted bilateral training
such as Blue Strike among their marines and Falcon
Strike among their air forces. It has been pointed out that
Thailand’s military relationship with China has become
closer after the freezing of U.S. military assistance
following the coup.
In September 2019, Thailand and the ROK signed
the General Security of Military Information Agreement
(GSOMIA).

**7 Vietnam**

Based on its viewpoint that the sea is closely associated
with the national construction and defense, Vietnam has
established the objective of becoming a strong marine
country, particularly prioritizing the modernization of
its military forces and law enforcement forces at sea
as well as ensuring the capability for maritime domain
awareness, maritime independence, sovereign rights,
jurisdiction and national interests at sea.
Vietnam deploys its omni-directional diplomatic
policy and intends to actively participate in international
and regional cooperation in order to build friendly
relations with every nation. In March 2016, Vietnam
opened an international port in the Cam Ranh Bay,
which is located in a strategically important location,
and Navy vessels from many countries including Japan
have called at the international Cam Ranh Bay port.
Vietnam and the United States have strengthened
their military relations in recent years. This has taken
such forms as bilateral/multilateral training with the
U.S. Navy and port calls by U.S. Navy vessels in
Vietnam In 2017 mutual visits were conducted by the


leaders of both countries, and an agreement was reached
on the deepening of defense cooperation. March 2018
marked the first port call by a U.S. aircraft carrier to
Vietnam after the end of the Vietnam war. In addition,
the U.S. aircraft carrier and cruiser made a call at Da
Nang in March 2020. In July 2021, U.S. Secretary of
Defense Austin talked and reached an agreement with
Vietnam Defense Minister Phan Van Giang in Vietnam
about the expansion of bilateral military cooperation in
the future, emphasizing the United States’ commitment
to the Southeast Asia region together with the U.S. Vice
President Harris’s visit in August of the same year.
Vietnam and Russia continue to strengthen
cooperation in the area of national defense, with
Vietnam being dependent on Russia for the majority of
its defense equipment. In April 2018, the two countries
signed a military and technical cooperation roadmap,
while in July 2019, a Vietnamese naval vessel visited
the port of Vladivostok for the first time. In December
2019, a submarine rescue vessel from Russia’s Pacific
Fleet visited the port of Cam Ranh and participated in
the first bilateral submarine rescue exercise.

See Section 5-5-5 (1) (Relations with Asian Countries)

Vietnam and China, under their comprehensive strategic
cooperation partnership relations, proactively conduct
high level government official exchanges while the
countries have conflicts over territorial sovereignty in
the South China Sea.
The defense white paper published in November 2019
demonstrates an awareness that Vietnam and China need
to resolve the territorial disputes with special precaution,
avoiding negative impacts on general peace, friendship,
and cooperation for development between the two
countries. As such, it recognizes that the two countries
should continue negotiations and consultations to find
peaceful solutions on the basis of international law.
Vietnam and India have been deepening their
cooperative relationship in a broad range of areas,
including security and economy. In the area of defense
cooperation, it is noted that the Indian Armed Forces
support the training of Vietnam’s Navy submarine
personnel and Air Force pilots, and Indian Navy
vessels make friendly visits to Vietnam. In September
2016, Prime Minister Modi became the first Indian
prime minister to visit Vietnam in 15 years. During
the visit, an agreement was reached on raising the
status of the bilateral relationship to a comprehensive

In recent years, Southeast Asian countries have increased China. In June 2019, Malaysia announced that it was to

development and other reasons, and are modernizing
their military forces, focusing on introducing
equipment such as submarines and fighters, including
fourth-generation modern fighters. On the other hand,
some countries have announced defense budget cuts
and postponements of equipment procurement in
consequence of the COVID-19 pandemic.
Although Indonesia concluded a contract with Russia
to procure eleven Su-35 fighters in February 2018,
they relinquished it in December 2021 for budgetary
reasons. It is reported that Indonesia was under study
about Rafale (France) and F-15 EX (United States)
as alternatives. With the ROK, Indonesia concluded
an agreement to purchase three ROK-made 209-class
submarines, the third of which was reportedly
produced in Indonesia and completed diving trials in
January 2020. In January 2016, the two countries also
concluded a detailed agreement on cost sharing and
bilateral cooperation in the joint development of the
4.5 generation KF-X/IF-X fighter, which was, in the
rollout ceremony of the first prototype, named as KF-21
in April 2021. Indonesia plans to receive 14 ScanEagle
UAVs from the United States by March 2022. As well
as showcasing Chinese CH-4 UAVs at an October 2019
celebration for Indonesian National Armed Forces Day,
in December 2019 Indonesia unveiled the prototype
Black Eagle UAV, a domestically produced unmanned
aerial vehicle that has incorporated several aspects of
China’s CH-4 UAV. In April 2020, Indonesia planed
to reduce defense budget three consecutive years from
2022 to 2024 in consequence of the measures taken
against the COVID-19 pandemic. The defense budget
cutback of FY2022 established in August 2021 was
about two percent from the previous year.
Malaysia announced a plan to build six indigenous
LCSs. The first of these vessels was launched in August
2017. Furthermore, by December 2021, Malaysia
introduced four littoral mission ships (LMSs) from


cooperation through Defense Minister meetings, etc.

See Chapter 4, Section 5-1 (Trends Related to the “Principle of

the Freedom of the High Seas”)

China. In June 2019, Malaysia announced that it was to
receive 12 ScanEagle UAVs from the United States by
March 2022.
In December 2019, Myanmar received a Kilo-class
submarine, named Minye Theinkhathu, from India. The
procurement of the country’s first submarine is attracting
attention from neighboring countries.
The Philippines has taken steps in recent years to
modernize its defense equipment against the backdrop
of conflicts over territorial rights in the South China Sea.
In terms of air force capabilities, between November
2015 and May 2017, the Philippines successively
introduced 12 FA-50PH light fighters purchased from
the ROK. It is currently planning to initiate a multi-role
fighter program. In addition, the Philippines received
six A-29 light attack aircraft from Brazil as successors
of aging OV-10 light attack aircraft in October
2020, and also held a delivery ceremony of eight US
ScanEagle unmanned aerial vehicles in November 2020.
Furthermore, a procurement contract for a supersonic
cruise missile “BrahMos” from India was concluded in
January 2022.
As for naval forces, the Philippines received three
Hamilton-class frigates from the United States by
2016. The Philippines introduced two Indonesian-made
landing dock vessels by 2017. In addition, two frigates
were introduced from the ROK by March 2021. The
August 2019 commissioning of a Pohang-class corvette
received from the ROK marked the restoration of the
antisubmarine capability that the Philippines had long
lacked. That September, the Philippines conducted the
DAGIT-PA multi-service military exercise involving the
army, navy, and air force, during which the four AAV-7
assault amphibious vehicles that it had commissioned
the previous June were operated.
Singapore is actively striving to modernize its forces.
Today, it is one of the largest arms importers in the
world.
It introduced 24 U.S.-made F-15 fighters by 2012 and
also participates in the F 35 JSF Program In January

2020, the U.S. Government officially approved the sale
of F-35B fighter jets to Singapore and delivered the
required certification notifying Congress of the sale.
As for Thailand, in July 2014, the country established
the Submarine Squadron Headquarters. In April 2017,
the Royal Thai Navy drew up a plan to purchase three
Yuan-class submarines from China over the next 11
years, and the Thai Cabinet approved the purchase of one
vessel. However, in April 2020, Thailand announced that
it would postpone the procurement of two Yuan-class
submarines from China in order to secure the budget for
COVID-19 countermeasures. In addition, the Cabinet
approved in September 2012 a plan to introduce two
frigates. The first frigate was received from the ROK in


dock from China. In addition, by 2013, Thailand had
introduced 12 Swedish-made JAS-39 Gripen fighters
and received 35 of the 60 Stryker armored vehicles

With a population of more than 1.3 billion on its vast
land, India is the world’s largest democratic country. It
has achieved steady economic growth in recent years,
and has significant influence in the South Asian region.
Also, it is located in the middle of the Indian Ocean,
which is of strategic and geopolitical importance in
terms of sea lines of communication, connecting the

aircraft as of the end of February 2022. The second
Rafale squadron was established in July 2021. Besides,
the test launch of the air-launched supersonic cruise
missile “BrahMos” from a Su-30MKI fighter aircraft
was successfully conducted in December of the same

doctrine of 2003, it adheres to the following policies:
credible minimum deterrence, the no-first-use nuclear
policy, no use against non-nuclear weapon nations, and
maintaining the unilateral moratorium on nuclear tests that
it announced immediately after the nuclear test in 1998.
At the same time, it has been promoting development,
performance improvement, and deployment of various
ballistic missiles and cruise missiles.

**3 Relations with Other Countries**

**(1) Relations with the United States**
India is actively striving to strengthen bilateral relations
with the United States. When Prime Minister Modi
visited the United States in June 2016, the United States
recognized India is a “Major Defense Partner,” and in
August of the same year, in a joint statement of the U.S.
and Indian defense ministers, the United States agreed
to elevate defense trade and technology sharing with


U.S.-India Summit Meeting [CNP/Jiji Press Photo]

India to a level commensurate with its closest allies and
partners. In the first U.S.-India “2+2” Meeting held in
September 2018, the ministers came to an agreement to
hold the meeting every year. During the summit meeting
held in India in February 2020, both countries confirmed
“Comprehensive Global Strategic Partnership” between
them, and pledged to deepen defense and security
cooperation. In September 2021, the first face-to-face
summit meeting by Prime Minister Modi and President
Biden was held along with the Japan-Australia-IndiaU.S. (QUAD) summit meeting.
Since 2016, India and the United States signed
Logistics Exchange Memorandum of Agreement
(LEMOA), and concluded the Communications
Compatibility and Security Agreement (COMCASA) as
well as the Basic Exchange and Cooperation Agreement
(BECA). In addition, Indian forces have strengthened
its international interoperability through bilateral/
multilateral training and exercises such as Malabar[1]which
is held regularly with the United States and Japan, and
first tri-service exercise “Tiger Triumph” was held in
November 2019. Furthermore, the United States has
become one of India’s major equipment suppliers.[2]
The amount of bilateral defense trade increased from
less than US$1 billion in 2008 to over US$20 billion
in 2020. Meanwhile, the United States repeatedly
voiced concern about India’s procurement of the S-400
from Russia, expressing a possibility of applying the
Countering America’s Adversaries Through Sanctions
Act.[3] Attention will be paid to the moves of these two


Malabar was initially a bilateral maritime exercise between the United States and India, while Japan has participated in this exercise in 2007. From 2017 to 2019, Malabar was conducted as a
trilateral exercise among Japan, the United States and India. In 2020 and 2021, Malabar was conducted as a quadrilateral exercise by involving Australia.

Security Developments Involving the People’s Republic of China”
released in 2021, the U.S. Department of Defense indicated that
People’s Liberation Army Rocket Force launched more than 250
ballistic missiles for testing and training in 2020, which was
more than the rest of the world combined. In addition, China is
also believed to be promoting the development of hypersonic
glide vehicle. It is considered that the country will continue to
work on strengthening its missile capability.

See Section 2-2-5 (2) (Nuclear and Missile Forces)

Meanwhile, India has reportedly deployed the supersonic
cruise missile “BrahMos” developed jointly with Russia at
strategic points along the LAC. The missile is announced as
having a range of 290 kilometers, however, in July 2021 it was
reported that the flight range will be extended to 800 kilometers.
The “BrahMos-A,” which can be launched from Su-30MKI
fighter aircraft, is said to be under final phase of development.
In addition, India has been proceeding with the development and
introduction of the Agni medium-range ballistic missile series.
Agni-I, Agni-II, and Agni-III have already been deployed, and

Based on its Act East policy, India continues to
engage with Southeast Asian nations and other countries
in the Asia-Pacific region on a bilateral, regional, and
multilateral basis, promoting economic and cultural
relations, as well as pursuing the development of strategic
relationships. Leveraging its experience of using Russian
equipment, India provides Vietnam, Malaysia, and
other users of such equipment with support for capacity
building. Furthermore, India conducts joint exercises
regularly with countries. The third trilateral maritime
exercise “SITMEX” was conducted by India, Singapore,
and Thailand in November 2021.

Missile 1B” in December.[4]

Pakistan has been developing a relationship with China
in the military sector in recent years, and depends more
and more on China about, for example, the modernization
of its equipment. For instance, Pakistan jointly developed
the Al-Khalid tank and the JF-17 fighter aircraft with
China. It is currently using the 110 indigenously produced
JF-17 Block I / II aircraft, and has begun manufacture
of the JF- 17 Block III. In March 2022, it officially
announced the induction of Chinese J-10C aircraft, and it
is said that the aircraft will serve as a countermeasure to
Indian Air Force’s deployment of Rafale fighter aircraft.
Pakistan reached an agreement with China to purchase
eight submarines, which Pakistan is positioning as the
“backbone of the Navy,” and four of them will be built in
Pakistan under transfer of technology. While construction
in Pakistan was started in December 2021, it is reported
that the first submarine being built in China will be
delivered in 2022 and the whole project will be completed
by 2028. In October 2021, Pakistan inducted surface-toair missile system HQ-9/P from China to enhance its air
defense capability.
The “National Security Policy of Pakistan 20222026,” Pakistan’s first comprehensive policy document,
was formulated in December 2021. It mentions security
in its border territory and the Indian Ocean, and says that
the nation will enhance information and cyber security
capability and create a capacity to combat against hybrid
warfare such as disinformation and influence operations.
Attention will be paid to future efforts.

**3 Relations with Other Countries**

**(1) Relations with the United States**
Besides supporting the activities of the U.S. Forces in
Afghanistan, Pakistan had cooperated with the war on
terror by launching mop-up operations against Islamic
extremists in the Pakistan-Afghanistan border area.
Meanwhile, Pakistan urged the United States to
immediately end its drone attacks on Islamic extremists


**1 General Situation**

Wedged between the powerful South Asian nation of
India and politically-unstable Afghanistan, and sharing
borders with China and Iran, Pakistan is placed in a
geopolitically significant and complex position. In
particular, Islamic extremists conduct activities across
the Pakistan-Afghanistan border, and Pakistan’s attitude
towards the war against terrorism draws much attention
from the international community. In this regard, although
Prime Minister Khan welcomed the withdrawal of the
U.S. Forces from Afghanistan and the establishment of
Taliban’s control saying that the Afghans “broke shackles
of slavery” in August 2021, Pakistan continues to install
fences called “fence of peace” on the non-demarcated
border between Pakistan and Afghanistan to secure the
area, provoking a backlash from the Taliban. It is necessary
to continue watching related movements closely, because
this kind of Pakistan’s complicated attitude towards the
Taliban can affect not only their bilateral relationship, but
also the future of the whole security environment in the
surrounding area, including the war against terrorism.

**2 Military Affairs**

Pakistan takes the position that maintaining nuclear
deterrence against the nuclear threat posed by India is
essential to ensure national security and self-defense. It is
believed to have begun nuclear development in the 1970s
and conducted its first nuclear test in 1998.
Pakistan has been working on development of ballistic
missiles and cruise missiles capable of carrying nuclear
warheads, and conducted its first test launch of the ballistic
missile “Ababeel,” which is capable of delivering multiple
warheads, using Multiple Independently-Targetable Reentry Vehicle (MIRV) technology, in January 2017. Like
it did in the previous year, it conducted another test fire of
the submarine launched cruise missile “Babur” in March
2018. The country is thought to be steadily increasing
the capabilities of its missiles. For example, in 2021, it
conducted a training launch of surface-to-surface ballistic
missile “Ghaznavi” in August, a flight test of surface-to

Reports specify these missiles as follows. Ababeel: a three-stage solid-fuel ballistic missile with a range of about 2,200 km. Babur (Hatf 7): a turbo-jet super sonic cruise missile with a range of
about 700 km. Ghaznavi (Hatf 3): a single-stage solid-fuel ballistic missile with a range of about 300 km. Shaheen-1A (Hatf 4): a single-stage solid-fuel ballistic missile with a range of about 900

in Pakistani territory, and the Pakistani Government had
protested repeatedly.
The United States, on the other hand, has condemned
Pakistan for allowing Islamic extremists in Afghanistan
to take haven, which poses a threat to the United
States. In August 2017, U.S. President Trump stated,
“No partnership can survive a country’s harboring
of militants and terrorists who target U.S. Service
members.” After that, the United States announced the
suspension of Foreign Military Assistance provided by
the Department of State, security assistance provided
by the Department of Defense (DOD) and the DOD’s
Coalition Support Funds.

After the talks, Prime Minister Khan disclosed his feeling
that the two countries had gained a deeper understanding
of each other, stressing that “Pakistan will do everything
possible to ensure that this [Afghan] peace process goes
forward.”, with the desire for an improvement in relations
evident in such developments.
It is said that no summit meeting was held by the two
countries after inauguration of the Biden Administration
in January 2021, and Pakistan declined the invitation for
the Summit for Democracy hosted by the United States in
December of the same year. On the other hand, Pakistan

including the Baltic states, NATO and member states have
recognized the threat posed by Russia and are working to
bolster deterrence. At the NATO Summit in September
2014, leaders adopted a joint declaration demanding
Russia to retract its “annexation” of Crimea and adopted
the Readiness Action Plan (RAP) for enhancing existing
readiness forces.[1] Based on this plan, NATO has continued
to maintain its presence in eastern allies, while steps have
been taken to significantly improve the readiness of the
existing multinational NATO Response Force (NRF)
and create the Very High Readiness Joint Task Force
(VJTF) that can be mobilized within two to three days.
Furthermore, at the NATO Summit in July 2016, members
decided to deploy four multinational battle groups to the
three Baltic nations and Poland on a rotational basis.
These became fully operational in 2017. At the NATO
Summit in July 2018, members decided to put in place a
readiness initiative called the “Four Thirties,” to maintain
a situation in which, by 2020, 30 mechanized battalions,
30 air squadrons, and 30 combat vessels can be ready
to be used within 30 days or less. They also decided on
reforms of the command headquarters, establishing the
Joint Force Command Norfolk in the United States with
the objective of strengthening the defense of Atlantic
sea lines of communications between the United States
and Europe, as well as establishing the Joint Support
and Enabling Command in Ulm, Germany, to expedite
the transport of troops and equipment within and outside
Europe.
With regard to the rising tensions in Ukraine, NATO
Secretary General Stoltenberg rejected Russia’s demand
to make Ukraine abandon its wish to join NATO in
December 2021, by showing an uncompromising stance
that Ukraine and NATO member countries have the
right to choose their own paths as sovereign nations.
Moreover, during an extraordinary summit meeting
held in February 2022, NATO announced to deploy
NATO Response Force (NRF) to the eastern part of
the alliance to provide reassurance. During a summit
meeting in March 2022, they decided to establish four
additional battlegroups in Bulgaria, Romania, Hungary,

In the NATO Summit in November 2010, NATO
adopted a new Strategic Concept for the first time in
11 years and prescribes three core tasks as follows: (1)
collective defense in accordance with Article 5 of the
Washington Treaty; (2) crisis management including
conflict prevention and post-conflict stabilization
and reconstruction assistance; and (3) cooperative
security including active contribution to arms control,
disarmament, and non-proliferation. In the NATO summit
meeting of June 2021, NATO adopted the “NATO 2030”
initiative, which seeks to strengthen NATO’s functions.
The communique of this meeting mentions efforts to
address all of the major challenges faced by NATO, such
as the rise of China, cyber attacks, asymmetric warfare
including disinformation campaigns, threats in the space
domain, disruptive technologies, climate change, and
Russia’s active military activities.
Particularly, China’s stated ambitions and assertive
behavior were specified as challenges against the rulesbased international order, with allusion to concerns
about its military cooperation with Russia, its frequent
lack of transparency, and use of disinformation. NATO
clearly stated its stance to keep its engagements with
China in order to defend the security interests of the
alliance. Furthermore, to support the rules-based
international order, it said that the cooperation would be
enhanced with partners in Asia-Pacific region including
Australia, Japan, New Zealand, and the ROK.
With regard to Russia, although there were some
differences in perception among member countries in
the past because of dissimilarities in background such
as economical relationship or geological distance with
Russia, now they recognize Russia’s aggressive actions
as a threat to security in Europe and the North Atlantic
area. Russia’s aggression against Ukraine in February
2022 acted as a big alarm for these countries.
Following Russia’s development of “hybrid warfare”


The RAP was approved as one of the concrete efforts of the Connected Forces Initiative (CFI). The CFI is intended to provide a framework for conducting joint training and exercises among member

and Slovakia.
Alongside collective defense, NATO’s core tasks
include crisis management operations both within and
outside the region. In the Mediterranean, a permanent
maritime force has been deployed to the Aegean Sea
since February 2016 due to increase in the influx of
illegal immigrants transiting the Mediterranean. This
force monitors the influx of illegal immigrants and shares
information with Turkey, Greece, and other countries.
Also, Operation Sea Guardian, which focuses on crisis
management, was launched in November 2016 and a
wider array of missions including counterterrorism and
capacity building assistance have been conducted.
Since January 2015, NATO had been leading the
Resolute Support Mission (RSM), whose primary tasks
were to provide training, advice, and assistance to the
Afghan National Defense and Security Forces (ANDSF),
deploying about 17,000 personnel in the country.
However, NATO completed the withdrawal of its forces
by the end of August 2021, after the United States declared
its withdrawal from Afghanistan. During evacuation
operations of nationals and local staff when the Taliban
assumed control, the U.K. secured Kabul Airport with
the U.S. and evacuated approximately 15,000 people by
C-17 transport aircraft while some major NATO member
states like France, Germany, and Italy also deployed their
assets to evacuate a number of people.
With regard to the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant
(ISIL), NATO has dispatched early warning and
control aircraft forces and implemented NATO
surveillance and reconnaissance missions since October
2016. It is also supporting security units of Iraqi
Armed Forces on training and capacity building. At the
February 2020 Meetings of NATO Ministers of Defence,
participants agreed to enhance NATO’s training mission
in Iraq, to contribute to the stabilization of the situation
in the Middle East. In addition, at the February 2021
Meetings of NATO Ministers of Defence, participants
reached an agreement regarding NATO’s training
mission in Iraq to increase the number of participating
personnel from approximately 500 to 4,000 and expand
the mission locations. NATO is also carrying out
missions in Kosovo and other countries.
In light of the expansion of NATO’s role from these
security environment changes, and the expanding gap of


defense expenditure between the United States and other
member states, NATO member countries in 2014 agreed
on the goal to allocate 2% or more of their GDP to defense
spending by 2024. The London Declaration was adopted
at NATO’s 70th anniversary summit in December 2019.
The participating leaders reaffirmed therein their solemn
commitment to collective defense as enshrined in Article
5 of the Washington Treaty and stated that they will
increase defense expenditure further.

**2** **EU**

The EU has enhanced its security initiatives under the
Common Foreign and Security Policy (CFSP) and
Common Security and Defence Policy (CSDP),[2] and
in June 2016, the Global Strategy for the European
Union’s Foreign and Security Policy detailing the EU’s
fundamental approach to foreign and security policy
was adopted by the European Council for the first time
in approximately 10 years. This document calls for
initiatives towards enhancing the EU’s internal and
external resilience against threats to public order in Eastern
Europe, and the threat of terrorism or other events in the
Middle East and Africa, in accordance with the principles
of rules-based order and democracy. In November 2016,
the European Commission released an action plan for
reinforcing defense cooperation in Europe, including the
establishment of the European Defence Fund (EDF).
In December 2017, the Permanent Structured
Cooperation (PESCO) was launched as a defense
cooperation framework composed of 25 countries
among the member countries. Under this framework,
the participating countries finance and cooperate in joint
projects including the joint development of equipment
and infrastructure that will contribute to developing
readiness. It is expected that the framework would
strengthen the EU’s defense capabilities. In this way,
the EU is trying to enhance capabilities for undertaking
security and its strategic independence by responding to
the present and future security demands in Europe.
Furthermore, the EU is enhancing its engagement
to the Indo-Pacific region, disclosing its first IndoPacific strategy in April 2021 followed by a joint
communication detailing it in September 2021. This joint
communication says that a significant military build

The EU, although it has a property of non-binding multilateral cooperation, introduced the CFSP, which covers all areas of foreign and security policy based on the Treaty of Maastricht, which took
effect in 1993. In June 1999, the European Council decided to implement the European Security and Defence Policy (ESDP) to offer peacekeeping and humanitarian assistance activities in conflict

European countries’ “incline” towards the Indo-Pacific region and the
dispatch of naval vessels in rapid succession in 2021


Column


In recent years, European countries have been strengthening their
commitment to the Indo-Pacific region, with the European Union
(EU) and major countries including the U.K., France, Germany, and
the Netherlands publishing policy documents and similar regarding
the region. 2021 in particular was a year that symbolized European
countries’ “incline” towards the Indo-Pacific region, with European
vessels calling at Japanese ports one after another.
The United Kingdom dispatched its Carrier Strike Group 21
(CSG21) to the Indo-Pacific region from May 22, 2021. The carrier
strike group was made up of ten multinational naval vessels, such as
the destroyer USS “The Sullivans,” the Royal Netherlands Navy’s frigate
HNLMS “Evertsen,” and the state-of-the-art U.K. aircraft carrier HMS
“Queen Elizabeth” at the center, as well as U.S and U.K. squadrons of
mainly F-35s. Calling at Guam, Singapore, India, and elsewhere during
its deployment of about 28 weeks, the carrier strike group carried
out joint exercises with each country it visited. From September 4
to 8 that same year, the carrier strike group also called at Japanese
ports including the U.S. Navy Base in Yokosuka, where it conducted
multilateral exercises involving the five countries of Japan, the United
States, the United Kingdom, the Netherlands, and Canada, and which
included the Maritime Self-Defense Force’s (MSDF) destroyer JS “Ise.”
These activities by the United Kingdom can be seen as a reflection
of the so-called post-Brexit “Global Britain” foreign policy of seeking
economic and diplomatic stages in places around the world beyond
Europe. The Indo-Pacific is an important region for the United
Kingdom that accounts for almost 20% of its trade volume, therefore
engagement in the region and securing freedom of navigation can be
considered essential for U.K. national interests. In addition, prior to
the dispatch of the carrier strike group, the United Kingdom released
the “Integrated Review of Security, Defence, Development and
Foreign Policy” in March 2021, a strategy document that established
comprehensive policies on security and diplomatic affairs. This
document touches on China’s military expansion, assessing it in more
depth than ever before using the phrase, “systemic competitor.” In
addition, it also includes a section titled “The Indo-Pacific tilt,” in which
it declares that the Indo-Pacific region is important for U.K. economy
and security, and that over the next decade, the United Kingdom will
build a larger and more steady presence than any other European
country in the region to deepen its cooperation with its allies and other
like-minded partners including Japan.
In light of these circumstances, the objective of the recent dispatch
of the carrier strike group by the United Kingdom can be considered
as a demonstration of the ocean projection capabilities of its aircraft


carriers, as well as a way of impressing other countries with the
strength of its cooperation with its partners, including the U.S.-U.K.
alliance and Japan. It also demonstrates the U.K.’s intention and
capability to contribute to the stability of the Indo-Pacific region.
The French amphibious assault ship “Tonnerre” and the frigate
“Surcouf” also docked at Japan on May 9, 2021. Both vessels were
dispatched to the Indo-Pacific region as part of the ocean navigation
exercise for officer candidates, Jeanne d’Arc 2021. From May 11 to
17 of the same year, the vessels conducted multirateral exercise called
ARC21 involving Japan, the United States, Australia, and France, and
in the Kirishima Maneuver Area in Kyushu in particular, the French
Army carried out amphibious operation training together with the
Japanese Ground Self-Defense Force (GSDF) and U.S. Forces Japan.
France announced a national defense strategy specifically for
the Indo-Pacific region for the first time in June 2019. As part of the
strategy, the situation was assessed as follows: China is seeking to
change the power balance of the region with its growing influence,
and thus, the strategic environment is deteriorating as the rivalry
between the United States and China intensifies. France recognizes
itself as an “Indo-Pacific nation” having territories and a population
of approximately 1.65 million in the Indo-Pacific region. It is believed
that France will continue to engage in the region in cooperation with
its partners, such as Japan, the United States, Australia, and India,
by dispatching assets and similar to defend those territories and the
population.
The German Navy frigate “Bayern” called at a port in Tokyo on
November 5, 2021. This was the first time in 16 years that a German
warship had been dispatched to the Pacific Ocean since taking
part in rescue activities during the Sumatra earthquake incident
in 2005. It was also the first call at a Japanese port in about 20
years. After participating in NATO and EU maritime operations in the
Mediterranean Sea and off the coast of Somalia, “Bayern” visited the
shores of the Pacific Ocean. As well as engaging in monitoring ship-toship transfers by North Korea, a first for a German naval vessel, after
calling at the port in Tokyo, “Bayern” also participated in multilateral
exercise with countries including Japan and the U.S. After passing
through the South China Sea and visiting countries in Southeast Asia
and nearby, Bayern returned to its home base.
German Minister of Defense Annegret Kramp-Karrenbauer
stated that the purpose of the dispatch of this naval vessel was to
show Germany’s presence in the Indo-Pacific region. Germany also
approved the “Policy guidelines for the Indo-Pacific region” by Cabinet
decision in September 2020, bolstering its stance on strengthening its

engagement in the Indo-Pacific region in terms of security policy as
an advocate of existing rule-based international order. The guidelines
declared that a unilateral hegemony and the consolidation of bipolar
structures would be dangerous, particularly emphasizing cooperation
with democracies and countries sharing the same values such as
ASEAN, Japan, Australia, India, and ROK in an effort to continue
diversifying cooperative relations with each country. This dispatch can
be seen as aiming to proactively cooperate with partners by sending
assets independently to achieve the existing rules-based international

up, including by China, and the display of force and
increasing tensions in the East China Sea, South China
Sea, and Taiwan Strait have a direct impact on European
security and prosperity. With the aim of a rules-based
international order, partnership with countries sharing
the same values, including Japan, is needed, together
with a reinforcement of relations with Taiwan, such as
through trading and investments. In March 2022, the
European Council adopted a “Strategic Compass” laying
out a common strategic vision for security and defense
policies in the next five to ten years. The document stated
that the EU will establish a fully operational EU Rapid
Deployment Capacity of up to 5,000 troops by 2025 for
use in rescue and evacuation operations.
In response to the crisis in Ukraine, the EU has
condemned the Russian military measures and has
implemented economic sanctions against Russia after
its “annexation” of Crimea in 2014. The EU has further
implemented additional restrictive measures including
economic sanctions since February 2022. In addition,
the EU keeps up non-military engagements for Ukraine
including significant financial support to help its political
and economic reform. In January 2022, European
Commission President Ursula von der Leyen announced
an additional financial assistance of 1.2 billion euros
which will help Ukraine “to address financing needs
due to the conflict”. On the military front, the EU also
announced assistance of 1 billion euros for the Ukrainian
Armed Forces by the end of March 2022.
To deal with the threat of ISIL, the EU extends funds
to carry out humanitarian assistance for Syria and Iraq.
Additionally, the EU works with countries in regions such
as the Middle East and North Africa to provide capacity


order.
As in the above, the assets dispatched by each country come in
different forms, and each country’s aims of engaging in the IndoPacific region also differ, as seen from the respective strategic
documents. However, all these countries share the intention to
strengthen their engagement in the region in terms of security policy.
Japan welcomes movements by European countries sharing universal
values to contribute to the peace and stability of the region. We will
also continue to monitor the situation closely.

building assistance in counterterrorism measures, among
other activities. In November 2015, in accordance with a
request from France after the terror attacks in Paris, the
EU, for the first time, activated the “mutual assistance
clause” stipulating a mutual defense obligation, and EU
member states provided their support to France.
Since 2003, the EU has proactively undertaken both
military operations and nonmilitary missions under the
CSDP.[3] Operation Atalanta, the EU’s first maritime
mission for counter-piracy, has been under way off
the coast of Somalia and in the Gulf of Aden since
December 2008. Under this mission, vessels and aircraft
dispatched from each country protect ships in the area
and conduct surveillance in these waters. In addition,
those vessels and aircraft conduct joint training with
the Self-Defense Forces (SDF) units. Since July 2017,
the scope of activities has been expanded through the
assignation of new missions, including reconnaissance
on illegal transactions in crude oil exported from Libya
and information sharing with relevant organizations
on human trafficking. Since March 2020, a maritime
operation in the Mediterranean, Operation IRINI, whose
primary mission is to monitor the arms embargo against
Libya, has been conducted.

**3 Cooperation between NATO and the EU**

Advancements have been seen in cooperation between
NATO and the EU in addressing unprecedented
challenges efficiently. At the NATO Summit in July 2016,
a joint declaration was released citing hybrid threats,
cybersecurity and other fields in which NATO and the
EU should prioritize cooperation. The NATO Summit


These are called Petersberg tasks. They consist of: (1) humanitarian assistance and rescue missions; (2) peacekeeping missions; and (3) combat missions in crisis management, including

in July 2018 issued a joint declaration that identified
substantial progress in NATO-EU cooperation and
cited the mobility of military forces, counterterrorism
and other fields for further cooperation. Based on these
declarations, the EU’s PESCO includes a project for
developing arrangements for smooth movement of

Parliament, titled the “Defence in a Competitive Age,”

**1 The United Kingdom**


After the end of the Cold War, the United Kingdom,
perceiving that there is no direct military threat against
the country, has advanced national defense reform with
particular focus on improving its overseas deployment
capability and readiness, in order to deal with new
threats such as international terrorism and proliferation
of WMDs.
In March 2021, the Johnson administration
released the “Integrated Review of Security, Defence,
Development, and Foreign Policy” (Integrated Review).
It sets out a comprehensive strategy including foreign
policy and development to adapt to a more competitive
age under the post-Brexit diplomatic policy “Global
Britain”. As the trends that influence the United
Kingdom and international order, the U.K. Government
identified the following four contexts as particularly
important: geopolitical shifts such as the growing
importance of the Indo-Pacific; systemic competition
between democratic and authoritarian values and
systems; rapid technological changes; and transnational
challenges, such as climate change.
In the same month, the British Ministry of Defence
released a Defence Command Paper Presented to


military personnel and assets inside and outside the EU
and is expected to contribute to NATO’s quick military
deployment in an emergency. In this way, NATO and
the EU are advancing their cooperation in a manner to
complement each other for the purpose of enhancing
security initiatives.

Parliament, titled the “Defence in a Competitive Age,”
which supplements the Integrated Review and presents
details of the U.K.’s defense. The Ministry of Defence
proposed in this paper to increase the defense budget,
prioritize investments in the newer domains of space
and cyberspace, improve capacity of Marines, upgrade
vessels and aircraft, and reduce the army troops to deal
with various threats. In addition, the paper indicated
the increase in the overall nuclear warhead stockpile
and the implementation of enhancing nuclear deterrent
capabilities.
The United Kingdom also expressed its intention to
play more active roles in maintaining the international
order, while maintaining and strengthening the
relationship with the United States, European countries,
and NATO, as well as noting the government’s tilt to
the Indo-Pacific. The U.K. Government showed its
posture to work with Indo-Pacific partners to uphold
freedom of navigation and international law, such as
with the deployment of a carrier strike group led by
aircraft carrier HMS “Queen Elizabeth” to the IndoPacific region in 2021, and capacity building and
enhanced training with ASEAN countries and others.
Recently, to assist in international efforts to monitor
illicit maritime activities, including illegal ship-to-ship
transfers with North Korean vessels, the Royal Navy
frigate HMS “Argyll” conducted surveillance activities
in sea areas surrounding Japan, including the East
China Sea, in December 2018 and January 2019, while
the frigate HMS “Montrose” did the same between late
February and early March 2019 as well as frigate HMS
“Richmond” in September 2021. Japan and the United
Kingdom have also been cooperating in matters such as
the sharing of information, with the aim of enhancing
the effectiveness of UN Security Council resolutions.
In the Integrated Review, the United Kingdom stated
its intent to deepen its engagement in the Indo-Pacific
region in the decade ahead to establish a greater and

more persistent presence than any other European
country. Since then, the United Kingdom announced it
would deploy two patrol vessels in the area for forward
presence, and attention will be focused on the U.K.’s
moves in relation to its involvement in the region.
The U.K. government strongly condemns Russia’s
unilateral changes to, and attempts to change the status
quo by force and has enhanced its support to Ukraine.
It has deployed training teams to educate Ukraine
Armed Forces since 2015 and is enhancing its support
by providing weapons such as NLAW portable anti-tank
missiles and by other means.

**2 France**

Since the end of the Cold War, France has focused on
maintaining independence of its defense policies, while
having led initiatives to enhance the defense structure and
capability in Europe. It has worked on the development
of its military capacity by streamlining and integrating
military bases, dealing with operational requirements to
strengthen its defense capability, as well as enhancing
its intelligence capabilities and modernizing equipment
required in the future.
The Defence and National Security Strategic
Review announced by the Macron administration in
October 2017 states that the threats that France faces,
including domestic terrorism, the refugee issue, and
the Ukraine crisis, are diversifying, increasing in
complexity, and rapidly becoming more violent, and
amidst the increasingly multipolar international system,
competition is intensifying among major military
powers and the danger of escalation is growing. Under
these conditions, France will fulfill its duties within
NATO, including for collective defense and contributing
to reassurance and will take a leading role in efforts
to strengthen the EU’s defense capabilities. In June
2018, the Military Planning Law for 2019-2025 was
enacted, consisting of four pillars - human resources,
equipment modernization, contributions to Europe’s
strategic independence, and technological innovation to materialize the national security strategy given in the
Strategic Review. The law confirms a plan to allocate a
total of approximately 300 billion euros to defense by
2025 to fulfill President Macron’s commitment to the


goal of raising defense spending to 2% of France s GDP
by 2025. France achieved the goal of making defense
spending 2% of its GDP in 2020.
Having positioned the fight against ISIL as one of its
top national defense priorities, France has been conducting
airstrikes against ISIL in Iraq since September 2014
and in Syria since September 2015. The aircraft carrier
“Charles de Gaulle” supported anti-ISIL operations
while at sea in the eastern Mediterranean in April 2019
and was among the naval task force dispatched to the
eastern Mediterranean for a month in January 2020
to provide similar operational support. Furthermore,
French troops killed the top leader of an organization
linked to Al Qaeda in Sahel region in June 2020. Frenchled “Takuba” task force, composed of European special
forces, started its operation in July 2020. In addition,
France has continued to provide education and training
to the Iraqi Security Forces and Peshmerga, as well as
humanitarian assistance for refugees.
In January 2020, France and seven other European
nations, including the Netherlands and Denmark, issued
a political statement supporting the creation of the
European Maritime Awareness in the Strait of Hormuz
(EMASOH) surveillance mission, which has been
launched in response to a series of incidents affecting
the safe passage of civilian vessels in the Gulf of Oman
since May 2019.
Since France has territories in the Indo-Pacific
region, it is the only EU member state that has
continuous military presence in the region, with
approximately 7,150 personnel and vessels permanently
stationed. Placing importance on its commitment to the
region, France points out in the Strategic Review the
potential for a threat to interests, such as the freedom
of navigation, due to the worsening strategic situation
in the Asia-Pacific region, and clearly states that France
will maintain its stance of protecting the sovereignty
of its overseas territories in the Pacific Ocean and the
Indian Ocean. Defence Strategy in the Indo-Pacific,
which was published by Ministry of Armed Forces
in June 2019, states that China’s growing influence
is shifting the balances of power in the Indo-Pacific
region and highlights the importance of strengthening
partnerships with the United States, Australia, India, and
Japan[4]. In addition, France has proactively organized

multilateral exercises such as Croix du Sud and
Equateur in the South Pacific. In March 2019, an aircraft
carrier group including the aircraft carrier “Charles
de Gaulle” left France, and conducted the multilateral
naval exercise “La Pérouse” with Japanese, Australian,
and U.S. ships including MSDF Destroyer JS “Izumo”
in May 2019, when the group was deployed in the
Indian Ocean. Furthermore, France dispatched Falcon
200 reconnaissance aircraft to conduct surveillance
activities against illicit maritime activities, including
ship-to-ship transfers with North Korean vessels. In
2019, the frigate “Vendémiaire” conducted surveillance
activities in sea areas surrounding Japan including the
East China Sea, and the frigate “Prairial” conducted
the same duty from mid-February to early-March 2021.
From the viewpoint of enhancing the effectiveness of
the UN Security Council resolutions, Japan and France
engaged in cooperation activities, including information
sharing. As part of the long-term distant voyage mission
conducted from 2020 to 2021, the French nuclear attack
submarine “Émeraude” patrolled the South China Sea.
After the completion of the activities, French Minister
for the Armed Forces Florence Parly noted that France
conducted the patrol mission, “To enrich our knowledge
of this area and to affirm that international law is the only
rule that is valid, whatever the sea in which we sail.” In
May 2021, French navy sent the training fleet “Jeanne
D’Arc” to Indo-Pacific region, and the frigate “Surcouf”
and amphibious assault ship “Tonnerre” made port
call in Japan, in order to conduct multilateral exercise
“ARC 21.” This exercise includes amphibious operation
trainings, bearing islands defense in mind, conducted
by Japan, France, the United States, and Australia. In
January 2021, France released the Strategic Update
2021, a supplementary version of the 2017 Defense
and National Security Strategic Review. France, in this
update, expresses its vigilance against Russia’s strategic
intimidation and China’s maritime expansion to the
South China Sea, and its intention to engage more in the
Indo-Pacific, stating that it will contribute to the region
particularly in cooperation with Japan, Australia and
India.

**3 Germany**

While Germany has been implementing a large-scale
reduction of its military personnel since the end of the
Cold War it has been gradually expanding the dispatch


of its federal forces overseas. At the same time, Germany
has advanced the reform of its armed forces to enable
them to execute multiple responsibilities encompassing
conflict prevention and risk management in the context
of multilateral organizations, including NATO, the EU,
and the UN. However, following a worsening in the
security environment, in May 2016 Germany changed
policy and announced that it would increase military
personnel by around 7,000 by 2023.
The country’s defense white paper released in July
2016 for the first time in about 10 years explains that
Germany’s security environment has grown more
complex and unstable, causing gradually rising
uncertainty, citing specific threats such as international
terrorism, cyber attacks, interstate conflict, and the influx
of refugees and immigrants. The white paper also states
that Germany would continue to emphasize multilateral
cooperation and cross-government approaches, while
striving to realize rules-based international order.
German government greatly changed its defense
policy in response to Russia’s aggression against
Ukraine in February 2022. This includes the suspension
of approval for “Nord Stream 2,” weapon provision to
Ukraine, and devoting its efforts to improvement of
defense capabilities. Furthermore, Chancellor Scholz
announced that the government will hike the defense
budget from around 1.5% of GDP to 2% of GDP and
keep it that way every year. Based on these facts,
attention will focus further on Germany’s roles in the
future security and defense of Europe.
In September 2020, the cabinet decision was made
on the “Policy Guidelines for the Indo-Pacific Region,”
which stipulated diplomatic guidelines for the IndoPacific. In the guidelines, Germany states the intention
to strengthen its security policy engagement in the IndoPacific region and clarifies its stance of emphasizing the
cooperation with partners with shared values including
Japan. As specific initiatives, monitoring UN sanctions
against North Korea, taking part in exercises in the
region, expanding the forms of maritime presence,
expanding cybersecurity cooperation and other efforts
are mentioned. Germany deployed frigate “Bayern”
to Indo-Pacific region in August 2021. After “Bayern”
conducted bilateral training with the MSDF and made
port call in Japan for the first time in two decades
in November 2021, she has undertaken maritime
surveillance duty against illegal activities such as illicit
ship to ship transfers by North Korean vessels the first

time for a German navy ship. Attention will be gathered
on German engagement to the area, because Germany
is considered to be a continuous assets provider for this
region in the future.

**4 Canada**

Canada promoted a reduction in defense spending and
the number of military personnel after the end of the
Cold war, while the number of personnel in operational
forces required for dealing with security issues such as
civil conflicts abroad and international terrorism was
on the rise. In response to these situations, Canada
increased the defense spending for a certain period and
the number of military personnel from 2000.
In June 2017, the Department of National Defence
of Canada released the National Defence Policy. In this
policy, Canada mentions that the United States is “still
unquestionably the only superpower,” while also stating
the view that a degree of major power competition has
returned among China with “increasing ability to project
influence globally,” and Russia with “its willingness
to test” the current security environment, which is
causing the growing importance for re-emergence of
deterrence. In accordance with this understanding of the
security environment, Canada places importance on its
own national land and the North American region on
the basis of the national defense policy. Based on the
idea that global security has a direct connection with
Canadian defense, Canada positions active international
contribution as a basis of the national defense policy.
In terms of the building-up of defense capability, the
Canadian defense policy focuses on the fields of space
and cyberspace and intelligence. It also states plans
to increase the national defense budget, which once
declined in the 2010s, by more than 70% in 10 years,
and the Regular Force by 3,500 (to 71,500) military
personnel. Furthermore, Canada released the Arctic and
Northern Policy Framework in September 2019, setting
up an objective to enhance Canada’s military presence,
based on the recognition that strategic, military, and
economic importance of the region is increasing.
Canada regards the United States as its most important
ally and conducts air defense, space defense, and
maritime patrolling and monitoring activities in North


America jointly with the United States through the North
American Aerospace Defense Command (NORAD). As
a founding member, Canada also places an importance
on its relationship with NATO, and has been actively
participating in NATO-led operations in Central and
Eastern Europe and Afghanistan. Canada has been
supporting Ukraine Armed Forces through providing
non-lethal weapons and training support since 2015,
and turned to more proactive support through providing
lethal weapons such as machine guns in response to
the start of Russia’s aggression against Ukraine in
February 2022. In addition, as a member of the Five
Eyes (FVEY), an intelligence-sharing alliance, Canada
receives a great deal of benefits and intends to continue
deepening the relation with it. Canada traditionally
supports the activities of the United Nations, and the
Trudeau administration has expressed its stance that
contributing to the UN Peacekeeping Operations (PKO)
is of utmost importance.
With regard to the Asia-Pacific region, Canada, in
the above mentioned National Defence Policy, positions
itself as a Pacific nation and shows the intention to engage
in the region through strategic dialogues to exchange
views on regional security issues, such as territorial
disputes and the situation in the Korean Peninsula.
Since April 2018, as part of these engagements, Canada
has conducted surveillance activities against illegal
maritime activities including ship-to-ship transfers with
North Korean ships.[5] In addition, the whole Canadian
government is reviewing its approach towards China.
As the Canadian government has demonstrated its
recognition of threat that China is attempting to achieve
geopolitical objectives through a set of political,
economical, and military means, attention will be
focused on how the Indo-Pacific strategy currently
being developed will affect Canadian security policy for
Indo-Pacific region. With regard to the national defense,
Canada is reviewing its military relationship with
China’s People’s Liberation Army (PLA), and bilateral
training between Canada Armed Forces and PLA has
not been conducted since February 2018. On the other
hand, considering that Canadian warships have passed
through Taiwan Strait[6] several times in accordance with
international laws since 2018, attention will be paid to
future Canadian engagement to the region.


Canada has been engaged in this surveillance activities since June 2019 under the framework of “Operation NEON” which is the implementation activity of the sanctions imposed against North

they wanted to avoid any further escalation.
Thereafter, a series of incidents targeted on U.S.
interests was continued, including attacks to U.S.
military bases by armed organizations using drones in
2021. Given this situation, during that year, the United
States scaled down its stationed troops to 2,500 members
until January, and completed their combat mission in
December.
While the United States completed the withdrawal
of forces from Afghanistan in August 2021, its military
presence in the Gulf region has been decreasing. In the
Interim National Security Strategic Guidance released in
March 2021, the Biden Administration expressed that it
would right-size the U.S. military presence to the level
required to disrupt international terrorist networks, deter
Iranian aggression, and generally protect vital interests of
the United States. After April 2021, it was reported that
part of the fighter aircraft and air defense assets deployed
in the Gulf region by Trump Administration were
withdrawn. Furthermore, there has been no U.S. aircraft
carriers in the Middle East since the aircraft carrier USS
Ronald Reagan left the area in September 2021.

**2 Maritime Security in the Gulf Region**

Since May 2019, events affecting the navigation safety of
civilian vessels have occurred sporadically in the waters
of the Middle East. With regard to Japan-related vessels,
in June 2019, two vessels, including the chemical tanker
Kokuka Courageous operated by a Japanese shipping
company, were attacked in the Gulf of Oman. While
the United States and others have pointed out that the
attack was committed by Iran, Iran has denied any
involvement. Based on a comprehensive review of the
information from related countries, technical analysis of
the damage to the vessel, and testimony from the parties
concerned, Japan believes that the damage to the vessel
is highly likely to have been caused by limpet mines.[2]

From February to April 2021, other explosion and
attack incidents involving Iran- and Israel-related
vessels occurred one after another. Furthermore, in July
2021, a vessel owned by a Japanese company, operated
and managed by a British company chaired by an Israeli
businessman was attacked off the coast of Oman. U.S.
Central Command reported after an investigation that
an Iranian unmanned aerial vehicle was used in this

attack. In addition, the foreign ministers of G7 issued
a statement saying that “all available evidence clearly
points to Iran” about this attack.
Amidst rising tensions in the Middle East, countries
continue carrying out efforts to safeguard maritime
security in the region. The United States proposed the
Maritime Security Initiative in July 2019 and established
the International Maritime Security Construct (IMSC)
with its command center opened in Bahrain in
November. In addition to the United States, IMSC has
been joined by eight countries, including the United
Kingdom, Saudi Arabia, the UAE, Bahrain, Albania,
Lithuania, Estonia and Romania (as of March 2022).
In Europe, eight countries (France, the Netherlands,
Denmark, Greece, Belgium, Germany, Italy and Portugal)
issued a statement in January 2020 to politically support
the creation of the European Maritime Awareness in the
Strait of Hormuz (EMASOH) mission. In November
2021, Norway joined these countries. France, the
Netherlands, Denmark, Belgium, Greece and Italy have
dispatched their assets so far.
On the other hand, although Iran presented a plan
named “HOrmuz Peace Endeavor” (HOPE) as an
independent effort to maintain security in the Persian
Gulf and the Strait of Hormuz, and called on the
countries concerned to join in September 2019, the
concept has not been made concrete.
Japan needs to continue to pay close attention to the
future developments surrounding the situation in the
Gulf region.

**Trends in International Terrorism**
**1010[ Trends in International Terrorism]**


**1 General Situation**

There are prominent cases where power vacuums in
some countries with weak governance in the Middle
East and Africa have become a hotbed for activities of
international terrorist organizations such as Al Qaeda and
ISIL. This kind of terrorist organizations have instigated
fighters to conduct terrorist attacks at their home and
abroad, and are also spreading violent extremist
ideologies via Internet or other means. As a result,
“home-grown” terrorist attacks, committed by terrorists
influenced and radicalized by violent extremism in
their home country, and “lone-wolf” terrorist attacks,
planned and committed by individuals or small groups
that have no official relations with international terrorist
organizations but have become influenced by them
in some ways, have occurred in Western and other
countries. Moreover, terrorist attacks targeting certain
religions or races in a right-wing extremist political
context have also occurred in Western countries.
Among international terrorist organizations, ISIL
established multiple “provinces” outside of their original
base in Iraq and Syria as “Islamic State” territories, and
these “provinces” have been conducting terrorist attacks
in various places.
As for Al Qaeda, based primarily in Afghanistan, it is
believed to have been weakened, as many of the group’s
senior members were killed through U.S. operations.
However, it continues its activities as a central
organization, such as through issuing instructions and
recommendations to its affiliate organizations in Africa
and the Middle East.

See Fig. I-3-10-2 (Major Terrorist Groups Based in Africa and the

Middle East)

Concerning international counterterrorism measures,
international cooperation has grown even more important
as terrorism threats have diffused and deepened on the
diversification of terrorist attacks and the improvement
of terrorist groups’ attack capabilities.

fields under prolonged conflict.

**2 Trends of Activities in Africa**

Africa, in which ISIL or Al Qaeda affiliated organizations
are active, is reportedly the region most affected with
terrorism.[5] In some areas of West Africa such as Mali
and other parts of the Sahel region, conflicts between
terrorist organizations as well as vigorous terrorist
activities are observed. In Southern Africa, armed
groups such as the one later known as the ISIL Central
Africa Province, based mainly in Mozambique, have
assaulted and occupied some parts of the country since
2017, leading to the suspension of the development of
a natural gas field led by a French company in March
2020.
European and other countries have been providing
counter-terrorism operations and are providing trainings
against such terrorist organizations’ activities. For
example, France, having put troops in the Sahel region
from 2013, announced the withdrawal of French Armed
Forces and France-led multinational special forces from
Mali and the relocation of the troops to the border area
in adjacent Niger in February 2022. In Mozambique,
in August 2021, units dispatched from neighboring
countries contributed to the recapture of the area
occupied by armed groups, and an EU training mission
began operations in November 2021.

**3 Trends of Activities in the Middle East**

Since 2013, ISIL had become powerful by taking
advantage of the unstable situation in Iraq and Syria,
and unilaterally declared the establishment of the
“Islamic State” in 2014. From that year, the U.S.-led
Coalition forces conducted airstrikes in Iraq and Syria
and engaged in providing local forces with education
and training. In 2019, the United States announced that
it and the Coalition forces had liberated 100 percent
of ISIL-controlled areas in Syria and Iraq. In February
2022, U.S. Special Operation forces conducted a raid

against ISIL s leader at his stronghold in northwestern
Syria, and he died during the operation. In March 2022,
ISIL announced the appointment of a new leader and is
believed to still be active in Iraq and Syria.
In Afghanistan, while the Taliban are expanding their
controlled area, the ISIL Khorasan Province has been
continuously conducting terrorist attacks mainly in
the capital city of Kabul and eastern Afghanistan since
2015. When the Taliban, having a cooperative relation
with Al Qaeda, took control of Kabul in August 2021, a
suicide bombing was conducted in the vicinity of Kabul
International Airport while different countries were in
the process of evacuating their citizens and other people,
and the ISIL Khorosan Province claimed responsibility
for the attack. At the end of the same month, the
United States announced to continue counterterrorism
operations through over-the-horizon capabilities,
despite the completion of the U.S. Forces’ withdrawal.
On the other hand, Russia and China request the Taliban
to control terrorist organizations, while conducting


military exercises focused on prevention of terrorist
attacks.
Even after the withdrawal of U.S. Forces, the ISIL
Khorosan Province is actively conducting terrorist
attacks in Kabul and other areas. In September 2021,
General Milley, the U.S. Chairman of the Joint Chiefs
of Staff, said that reconstituted Al Qaeda or ISIL with
aspirations to attack the United States could present

**(1) Hypersonic Weapons** (HCMs) using scramjet engines and other technologies
The United States, China, and Russia are developing that enable hypersonic flights. It is suggested that
hypersonic weapons, including Hypersonic Glide hypersonic weapons would fly in lower orbits than
Vehicles (HGVs) that would be launched from ballistic conventional ballistic missiles at hypersonic speed

(Mach 5 or above) after their entry into the atmosphere, high maneuverability would make them difficult to be
and hit targets as well as Hypersonic Cruise Missiles detected and intercepted


-----

A high official of the U.S. Department of Defense
(DoD) mentioned a development plan of hypersonic
weapons in March 2021, revealing that the United
States will deploy the hypersonic weapons during
the first half of the decade starting in 2020, and build
defense capability in the second half.[1] A prototype of the
launcher for Long Range Hypersonic Weapon (LRHW)
was delivered to the U.S. Army in October 2021.
In China, the DF-17 ballistic missile, viewed as
capable of carrying an HGV, made its first public
appearance during the military parade marking the 70th
anniversary of China’s founding in October 2019. The
U.S. DoD pointed out that China started commissioning
the DF-17 in 2020. It has also been reported that China
conducted the launching experiment of a hypersonic
weapon to low earth orbit (LEO) around the summer
of 2021. About this experiment, General Milley, the
Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, revealed a sense
of danger about China’s rapid capacity improvement.
Russia deployed the HGV “Avangard” in 2019.
During the expanded executive meeting of Defence
Ministry held in December 2021, Minister of Defence
Shoigu said that the deployment of the new ICBM
“Sarmat”, capable of carrying the Avangard HGV for
combat duty was the priority issue of 2022. Furthermore,
Russia’s Defence Ministry successfully completed the
launching test of HCM “Zircon” from a submarine in
October 2021. President Putin stated in November of
the same year that the test was in its final stage and that
the deployment to Navy will start from 2022.

**(2) High-power Energy Technology**
High-power energy weapons, such as electromagnetic
railguns, high-power laser weapons, and high-power
microwaves, are being developed as a means to counter
various airborne threats.
Electromagnetic railguns are weapons that use
magnetic fields generated from electric energy to
launch projectiles. Unlike missiles, projectiles for
electromagnetic railguns have no propulsion systems
and are smaller, less costly, and can be stored in
smaller space, which supposedly makes it possible for
electromagnetic railguns to efficiently counter massive
missile attacks, if they become available for intercepting
missiles.
The United States, China, Russia and others are

developing high-power laser weapons to destroy targets
with laser energy. Laser weapons are expected as an
effective and less costly means against multiple small
unmanned vehicles and boats. Though it depends on
the technological maturity, high-power laser weapons
would excel in the speed of response compared with
conventional weapons, and they can be free from
ammunition constraints. Therefore, laser weapons, if
strengthened enough to intercept missiles, are expected
to be a potentially new missile defense system.
In May 2020, the United States Navy successfully
disabled a small unmanned aerial system in flight with
an onboard laser demonstrating unit during a test in the
Pacific Ocean. In December 2021, they also successfully
completed the intercept test of a flying target with a
high power laser demonstrating unit equipped on the
amphibious transport dock “USS Portland”, while
sailing in the Gulf of Aden.
China exhibited the 30-100 kW “Silent Hunter”
laser weapon system, capable of countering small
unmanned aircraft, at the IDEX 2017 international
defense exhibition. It is pointed that China is deploying
anti-satellite laser weapons that appear to be designed
to jam or damage the optical sensors of low-earth orbit
satellites. It has also been pointed out that even more
powerful laser weapons are being developed as antisatellite weapons.
Russia has deployed the 10 kW “Peresvet” laser
weapon system and it is reportedly developing a
megawatt-class chemical laser weapon system for
attacking satellites.
Furthermore, in June 2021, the Israeli Ministry of
Defense and an Israeli company announced that they
successfully completed a series of tests to intercept
more than one unmanned aircraft by an airborne laser

weapon in flight. Israel also successfully completed a
test to intercept more than one unmanned aircraft by a
land vehicle mounted with anti-UAV laser weapon in
February 2020.
High-power microwave technology can cause
destruction and malfunction in the electronic systems
responsible for such functions as intelligence-gathering
and command & communications aboard unmanned
aircraft, missiles and other airborne threats. The United
States Air Force has made a prototype of “Phaser”
high-power microwave system in 2019. During U.S.
Army exercises, the system reportedly countered two
to three small unmanned aircraft in one time and 33
in total. In July 2021, the U.S. Air Force Research
Laboratory revealed that it would develop new highpower microwave weapon system “Mjolnir” based

Some have argued that autonomous unmanned
vehicles could develop into so-called Lethal
Autonomous Weapons Systems (LAWS). Within the
framework of the United Nations Convention on Certain
Conventional Weapons (CCW), discussion on LAWS is
continued from the perspectives of their characteristics,
human elements, and international law.

**(2) Quantum Technology**
Quantum technology is positioned as an important
technology which brings innovation to society by
applying quantum mechanics that differ from familiar
physics that people sense every day. In December
2019, quantum cryptography communication, quantum
sensors, and quantum computers were given as
examples of quantum technologies expected for military
application by the Defense Science Board, which is a
consultation body for the U.S. Department of Defense.
Each nation is researching various issues of quantum
communication, such as quantum cryptography
communication which cannot be decoded by third
parties. China has developed the world’s longest
quantum cryptographic communications network,
extending over approximately 3,000 km and connecting
Beijing and Shanghai. In addition, in August 2016,
China launched “Mozi,” the world’s first satellite to test
quantum cryptographic communications. In January
2018, China said that it succeeded in using Mozi for
long-distance quantum cryptographic communication
between China and Austria.
Mr. Griffin, U.S. Under Secretary of Defense for
Research and Engineering at that time, stated in March
2020 that while too much optimism for application
of quantum technology to defense had to be avoided,
quantum sensors could be expected to improve
navigational information, and there was a possibility for
this to be achieved in the next few years.[3] Furthermore,
it is pointed out that quantum radar may be able to
neutralize the stealth advantage of stealth aircraft by
utilizing quantum characteristics.
It is pointed out that quantum computers can compute
large problems in a significantly shorter amount of time
and with less electricity consumption than existing
supercomputers and can also be applied to areas such as
decryption. Positioning quantum computer development

as a key science and technology project, China has
invested approximately 7 billion yuan in a national
laboratory for quantum information and technology and
other facilities.

**(3) Next Generation Information and Communication**
**Technology**

The fifth generation wireless mobile network system
(5G) has been gaining traction since commercial
services were launched in countries one after another
in April 2019 as a private mobile communications
infrastructure.
In March 2020, the United States announced the
National Strategy to Secure 5G, and in May 2020,
the U.S. Department of Defense 5G Strategy was
announced, which indicates defense policy approaches
of the national strategy. The DoD’s strategy has indicated
5G as an extremely important strategic technology and
that countries with proficient knowledge in cutting-edge
technology developed via this will gain economic and
military advantages. The DoD specified several bases as
experimental facilities for 5G in the activities started in
October 2019 to establish demonstrative infrastructures
for 5G experiments in the U.S. military bases. A 5G
network experimental facility was completed in the Hill
Air Force Base in Utah in December 2021.
Blockchain technology[4] used for virtual currencies is
also expected to apply to the military sector. The United
States selected it as one of the 20 Critical and Emerging
Technologies in the National Strategy for Critical and
Emerging Technologies issued in October 2020.

**(4) Additive Manufacturing Technology**
Additive manufacturing technology, as typified by
three-dimensional printing, can produce goods that
are too complex to be produced conventionally, at a
much lower cost. Given this, 3D printer technology
can bring revolutionary changes in logistics, such as
not depending on the stock when procuring parts, and
nations point out the military use of the technology.
For example, the U.S. Army noted that the technology
could trigger a real logistics revolution by making the
transportation of spare goods unnecessary, and the U.S.
Air Force announced it is manufacturing aviation engine
parts that were pointed out to be in shortage.

the dissemination of disinformation or the diffusion

**Diffusion of Information-related Technology and Information Warfare**
**4**

Concern about information warfare is rising, such as by governments such as China and Russia, including

of information aiming to degrade the reliability of a
government or split a society, using social networks
(SNS). It is pointed out that this was observed during the
annexation of Crimea by Russia in 2014, the probable
intervention of Russia in the U.S. Presidential elections
in 2016, Chinese activities for Taiwanese Presidential
elections in 2020, and the Russian invasion to Ukraine
in 2022. It is also pointed out that autonomous programs
called bots are used a lot for this kind of SNS operation.
Major social media companies have announced that
they deleted accounts used for propaganda[5] operations


by governments such as China and Russia, including
bot accounts.
Information warfare by dissemination of
disinformation like these may become stronger when
done in conjunction with more effective use of AI and
computing technologies. For this, the National Defense
Authorization Act 2021 requires the U.S. Secretary of
Homeland Security to issue a report about technologies
used to imitate digital contents and their effect on security
if used by foreign states. The U.S. Defense Advanced
Research Projects Agency (DARPA) conducts research
on algorithms to automatically detect imitated contents,
focusing on consistency of images and sounds.

that foreign adversaries are creating and exploiting
vulnerabilities in information and communications
technology and services to conduct malicious cyber
activities, including economic and industrial espionage
against the United States and its citizens.
The European Union (EU) strengthened Information
sharing related to foreign investments within member
states, starting full operation of its investment screening
scheme in October 2020. In 2021, the United Kingdom
conducted a public comment related to the creation of
a Foreign Influence Registration Scheme with the aim
to protect research in sensitive areas, etc. In January
2022, it enforced the National Security and Investment
Act 2021 in order to strengthen the response to the
investments with national security risks.
Australia enforced amendments to the Foreign
Acquisition and Takeovers Act 1975 in January 2021
and the Security Legislation Amendment (Critical
Infrastructure) Act 2021 in December 2021.
China, while trying to develop and acquire cuttingedge technologies for military use through CivilMilitary Fusion (CMF) policies, enforced the Export
Control Law in January 2020 and the Foreign Investment
Security Review Measures in January 2021.
Moreover, each country is increasingly trying to grasp
their own supply chains and take necessary actions.
In February 2021, the President of the United States,
recognizing the need for resilient, diverse, and secure
supply chains to ensure economic prosperity and
national security, issued the executive order 14017.
This order requires, for example, that the Secretary
of Defense submits reports identifying risks in the
supply chain for critical minerals and other strategic
materials such as rare earth elements, giving policy


recommendations to address such risks, and providing
details about supply chains of defense industrial base.
In June 2021, the White House then released its
100-day Supply Chain Review Report, to assess the
present situation and challenges of supply chains in four
areas, namely: semiconductors; critical minerals; high
capacity batteries; and pharmaceuticals. Furthermore,
one year review reports were issued in February 2022,
identifying the main vulnerabilities of supply chains in
six industrial bases (energy, transportation, agriculture
and food production, public health and biological
preparedness, information and communications
technology, and defense), as well as recommendations
of strategies to deal with these weaknesses.
In May 2021, EU updated its EU Industrial Strategy
2020 which covers the analysis results for sensitive
products supply chains.
Moreover, each country is significantly increasing
investments to research and development, not limiting
to the defense sector. The United States is preparing
to establish the Advanced Research Projects Agency
for Health (ARPA-H) with a budget of around US$6.5
billion for three years to drive high-risk and high-return
break-thorough within biomedical research, as well
as the Advanced Research Projects Agency-Climate
(ARPA-C). Germany established the Federal Agency
for Disruptive Innovation (SPRIN-D) to create rapid
innovations in the country in December 2019, and
anticipates 1 billion euros of funding for 10 years. The
United Kingdom established the Advanced Research and
Invention Agency (ARIA) specialized in investments
for high-risk businesses in the front line of innovation.
A 800 million pound budget has been allocated for the
time being.

See Part III, Chapter 1, Section 3-1 (Responses in Space Domain)

to develop and launch satellites takes off the merit of
having competitors spread conflicts to the space domain.
Moreover, in December 2021, the U.S. Missile Defense
Agency announced the deployment in Alaska of the
new Long Range Discrimination Radar (LRDR) for
missile defense, which has space situation surveillance
capability.
About policies, the U.S. National Security Strategy
(NSS) released in December 2017 pointed out that some
countries are pursuing a variety of ASATs on the basis
of the belief that the capability to attack assets in space
will give them asymmetrical advantages. The United
States released its National Space Strategy in March
2018, demonstrating its recognition that its adversaries
had turned space into a warfighting domain and vowing
to deter and defeat threats in the space domain to protect
the national interests of the United States and its allies.
Additionally, the DoD appraises China and Russia as the
most serious and eminent threats in their Defense Space
Strategy (DSS). It also establishes the three targets of
(1) build a comprehensive military advantage in space;
(2) integrate military space power into national, joint,
and combined operations; and (3) secure a stable space
domain. Furthermore, the United States government
says it will continue to use space for national security
activities under the principles of the peaceful use
of space found in the National Space Policy (NSP)
announced in December 2020.
Among U.S. government organizations, the National
Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) under
direct control by the President is responsible mainly
for non-military space development, while the DoD
undertakes research, development, and operation of
military observation and reconnaissance satellites.
In August 2019 the United States inaugurated the

U.S. Space Command as a new geographic unified
combatant command based on the Strategic Command’s
component in charge of space missions. In December
2019, the United States created the Space Force under the
Department of the Air Force as the sixth military branch,
with approximately 16,000 personnel. Moreover, the
U.S. Air Force Research Laboratory started construction
of a cutting-edge space environment research facility in
March 2021, planning to start operation in 2022.

**2 China**

China began working on space development in the
1950s. Recently, in January 2019, China became
the first country in the world to land an unmanned
spacecraft, called “Chang’e 4” on the far side of the
moon, and in September 2020, it successfully launched
a satellite payload rocket called “Long March 11” from
a ship in the Yellow sea. China is stimulating its spacial
activity through, for example, the launch of “Tianhe”,
the core module of China Space Station (CSS), in April
2021,[1] and the successful docking of manned spacecraft
“Shenzhou 13” with “Tianhe” in October of the same
year.
While traditionally emphasizing international
cooperation and the peaceful use of space, China has
not ruled out its military use of space and proactively
used space for military purposes, including information
collection, communications, and positioning through
satellites. For example, it is pointed out that the
“BeiDou” satellite positioning system can be used for
guidance of missiles as well as navigation of aircraft and
ships, and “Yaogan systems” launched several times in
2021 for electromagnetic environment surveillance
can be used for electronic reconnaissance. Both
systems are said to have the possibility of being used
for military matters. Moreover, a Chinese state-owned
corporation reportedly develops and manufactures not
only transport rockets such as the “Long March” series
but also ballistic missiles, the technology for transport
rockets having the possibility to be applied to ballistic
missiles. While China conducted a satellite destruction


experiment in 2007 as mentioned above, other antisatellite missile experiments[2] without destruction were
also conducted including the one in July 2014. Besides,
it is also pointed out that China develops hunter-killer
satellites, radio wave interference apparatus (jammer),
and weapons using directional energy such as laser ray.[3]

China is thus expected to focus on space development
through close cooperation between government,
military, and private sectors. China is now considered to
have become one of the space powers, and it has been
suggested that China could threaten U.S. superiority in
space in the future.[4]

In regard to policies, in its 2019 defense white paper
released in July 2019 and titled “China’s National
Defense in the New Era,” China asserts that space is
a critical domain in international strategic competition
and that space security provides strategic assurance
for national and social development. China revealed
its policy to accelerate the development of aerospace
fields in the “14th Five-Year Plan” and the “LongRange Objectives through the Year 2035” adopted at
the National People’s Congress held in March 2021. In
addition, it announced that it would develop aerospace
businesses, emphasizing that it is “constructing a space
power” in its white paper “China’s Space Program”
published in January 2022.
The Strategic Support Force, established in December
2015 as a force under direct control by the Central
Military Commission, is considered to be in charge of
space, cyber, and electronic warfare missions, including
the launching and tracking of satellites, although the
details of its missions and organization have not been
published. The Equipment Development Department of
the Central Military Commission is believed to be in
charge of crewed space programs.

**3 The Republic of Korea (ROK)**

The ROK’s space development is promoted based on
the Third Basic Space Development Promotion Plan
announced by the Moon administration under the Space
Development Promotion Act implemented in 2005. The
plan proposes a vision towards 2040, giving priority


In May 2021, China announced that a fragment of the “Long March 5B” used for this launch had fallen in the Indian Ocean. In response, NASA released an Administrator Statement saying that
“It is clear that China is failing to meet responsible standards regarding their space debris.”

According to the “Worldwide Threat Assessment,” the U.S. Director of National Intelligence (February 2015)

According to the “Annual Report to Congress: Military and Security Developments Involving the People’s Republic of China,” U.S. DoD (May 2019)

to (1) the establishment of its own launch vehicle
technology, (2) the advancement of satellite-using
services and satellite development, (3) the initiation
of space exploration, and (4) the development of the
Korean Positioning System (KPS). Furthermore, the
ROK is accelerating aerospace development, aiming
to have its own launch means, after the U.S. lifted
restrictions on South Korea’s ability to develop missiles
under an agreement about missiles reached by the two
countries in May 2021. For example, the ROK launched
a domestically produced rocket called “Nuri” in October
2021, and is planning five other launches by 2027.
Among organizations, the Korea Aerospace
Research Institute leads research and development as
an implementation agency. Furthermore, the Korea
Agency for Defense Development is engaged in the
development and use of various satellites. Also, to
secure space surveillance capabilities above the Korean
Peninsula, the country created the Air Force Satellite
Surveillance and Control Unit, the country’s first space
force, in 2019. The name of this force was changed to
the Air Force Space Operation Unit in 2020.
The ROK’s Ministry of National Defense says it
plans to secure surveillance, reconnaissance, and early
warning satellites in order to strengthen space related
capabilities.[5]

**4 Russia**

Russia’s space activities have been continuing since
the former Soviet Union era. The former Soviet Union
successively launched multiple satellites and had
the largest number of launched satellites in the world
until the collapse of the Soviet Union. While Russian
space activity has been reduced since the collapse of
the Soviet Union in 1991, it has become active again
in recent years. For example, Russia plans to construct
the “Sfera” satellite constellation system consisting of
600 satellites for observation, atmospheric phenomena,
communication, and positioning by 2030. In addition,
Deputy Prime Minister Borisov revealed a plan to
withdraw from the International Space Station after
2025 and to develop Russia’s own space station during
a TV show of the government-run television in April
2021.
Meanwhile, Russia has used its space capabilities


for military operations in Syria. Russian Minister of
Defense Shoigu revealed at a meeting of the Ministry of
Defence in 2019 that he has become aware of the need
to rebuild the country’s military satellites based on this
tactical experience. Russian missile defense capability
is continuously being strengthened. For example, its
fifth early warning satellite “Tundra” was successfully
put into orbit in November 2021. In addition, during
the same month, the Russian Ministry of Defense
announced that it had successfully destroyed a Soviet
satellite in orbit.
On the other hand, the remark of the director of
the State Space Corporation ROSCOSMOS during a
Russian congress, which said that satellite manufacturers
have many uncompleted satellites because of the
microchip shortage resulting from Western economic
sanctions, indicates that parts of satellite production
face difficulties.
In regard to Russian policies, in March 2016, Russia
released the Federal Space Program for 2016-2025 as a
specific future guideline for space activities, including
the development and deployment of domestic space
satellites and crewed flight programs.
From an organizational perspective, ROSCOSMOS
is in charge of space activities related to Russia’s
scientific and economic areas, while the Russian
Ministry of Defence is involved in space activities for
security purposes. The Russian Aerospace Forces, into
which the Air Force and the Aerospace Defence Forces
were integrated in August 2015, conduct actual space
activities for military purposes and manage facilities for
launching satellites.

**5 India**

India has promoted programs to develop manned space
missions, communications, positioning, observation,
etc. At their second meeting of their foreign and defense
ministers in October 2020, the United States and India
stated their intentions to continue discussing defense
cooperation in space.
India is believed to have operated the Navigation
Indian Constellation (NavIC) satellite as a positioning
satellite that can position locations around India. In
February 2017, India successfully launched a satellite
launch vehicle loaded with 104 satellites at low cost,


**Chapter**

which indicates its high technological capabilities. In
February 2021, India revealed its manned spacecraft
policy, announcing that it would start planning for its first
manned spacecraft “Gaganyaan”. In March 2019, Prime
Minister Modi announced that the country successfully
tested a missile to destroy a low-orbit satellite.
Among organizations, the Space Agency oversees
the Indian Space Research Organization (ISRO), which
implements space development policy, develops and
launches launch vehicles, and develops and manufactures
satellites. It has been reported that the Ministry of
Defence approved the creation of the Defence Space
Agency (DSA) to control ASATs and other space assets,
and to plan defense policies regarding space in April
2019. The ministry also approved the establishment
of the Defence Space Research Agency (DSRA) to
develop weapons and technology for space warfare in
June 2019.

**6 Europe**

Regarding European space activities, the EU, the
European Space Agency (ESA), and European countries
are promoting their own unique space activities and
are cooperating with each other to implement space
activities.
EU allocated 14,880 million euros to the space
policy of the medium-term budget plan from 2021
to 2027, and, in May 2021, established the European
Union Agency for the Space Programme (EUSPA)
that bears responsibility for execution of EU space
programs, including the safety management of satellite
positioning system. A satellite positioning system called
“Galileo” and an Earth observation program named
“Copernicus” under planning by the EU and ESA, and
a reconnaissance satellite project called “Multinational
Space-based Imaging System (MUSIS)” of the European
Defense Agency (EDA) are expected to be utilized for
the security field in Europe.
Also, in June 2019, NATO approved a space strategy
forming the guidelines for NATO’s approach to space. In
December the same year, at the NATO leaders’ summit,
space was declared as the “fifth tactical domain” next
to land, sea, air and cyberspace. This shows NATO’s
awareness concerning the importance of security in the
space domain. In October 2020, the NATO Defense
Ministers Meeting was held, where an agreement was
reached to establish a new space center in Ramstein


Germany. Furthermore, in the Communiqué issued
at the June 2021 NATO Summit, it was stated for the
first time that an armed attack in space could lead to the
invocation of NATO’s right of collective self-defense.
The United Kingdom, which exited the EU at the end
of 2020, announced in January 2021 that it would not
participate in the Galileo Program. Moreover, the Space
Command was formally established in April 2021, and
reportedly bears three functionalities, namely: space
operations; training and education for space related
personnel; and space capability (development and
service of space equipment plan). In regard to strategy,
it announced to invest 1.4 billion pounds to some fields
including ISR and satellite communication in the next
ten years in the National Space Strategy released in
September 2021 and Defence Space Strategy published
in February 2022.
France made reference to the creation of a space
command and the enhancement of threat identification
and space situation surveillance capabilities in the
Space Defence Strategy released in July 2019. In
September 2019, France created the space command
under the Air Force to integrate functions and personnel
of a military space surveillance operation center, a joint
space command and a military satellite surveillance
center within the Armed Forces Ministry. Also, in
September 2020, the country changed the name of the
Air Force to the Air and Space Force, adding activities
for guaranteeing freedom of behavior in space and free
access to space within the operations of the Air Force.

**2 North Korea**

North Korea has four major internal and external
intelligence agencies which consists of the
Reconnaissance General Bureau (RGB), the Ministry
of State Security, the United Front Department of the
Workers’ Party of Korea, and the Cultural Exchange
Bureau. It is pointed out that their main targets are the
ROK, the United States, and Japan.[4] Moreover, it has
been pointed out that their personnel are trained by the
authorities[5] lead by the RGB of Korean People’s Army,
and has intensively built up cyber units, operating some
6,800 people.[6]

It also is said that North Korea, which is under
sanctions of every kind, uses cyber attacks to acquire
foreign currency taking advantage of loopholes of
sanctions.[7] It also commits thefts of foreign military
secret intelligence, and develops attack capabilities for
the critical infrastructure of other countries. North Korea
is suspected of having been involved in the following
incidents.

-  In May 2017, a cyber attack used a malware called
WannaCry to encrypt and neutralize electronic data
held by hospitals, schools, businesses, and other
entities in more than 150 countries. Japan, the United
States, the United Kingdom, Australia, Canada, and
New Zealand announced a statement blaming North
Korea for its involvement in the attack. It was pointed
out that this cyber attack succeeded in collecting
140,000 dollars in Bitcoins.

-  In February 2021, the U.S. Department of Justice
prosecuted three North Koreans working under the
North Korean Reconnaissance General Bureau on
suspicion of involvement in a cyber attack.

China is suspected of conducting cyber attacks and
other activities to steal confidential information even
in peacetime.[3] For example, its involvement in the
following incidents has been pointed out.

-  In January and February 2018, Chinese government
hackers hacked a U.S. Navy contractor, leading to a
leak of classified information on supersonic anti-ship
missiles mounted on submarines.

-  In December 2018, such countries as the United
States announced that the APT10 cyber group related
to China’s Ministry of National Security conducted
cyber attacks on intellectual and other properties in at
least 12 countries.

-  In Japan, it has been confirmed that the APT10
group conducted extensive cyber attacks on private
enterprises, academic organizations and other targets.

-  In 2017, a U.S. consumer credit information company
came under the cyber attacks stealing personal
information including names, birthdates, social
security numbers, driver’s license numbers, and credit
card numbers. In February 2020, the U.S. Department
of Justice prosecuted four Chinese military-related
persons for their alleged involvement in the cyber
attack.

-  In July 2020, the U.S. Department of Justice prosecuted
two individuals who were alleged to be related to
China’s Ministry of State Security for launching a
cyber attack aimed at stealing intellectual property
and trade secrets from private companies, including
companies involved in the development of vaccines
for COVID-19.

-  In July 2021, the United States revealed that the cyber

-  Korea Atomic Energy Research Institute (KAERI)
revealed in May 2021 that the North Korean cyber
group invaded the internal network of KAERI
exploiting the VPN server’s vulnerabilities.

**3 Russia**

It has been pointed out that the Main Intelligence
Directorate of the General Staff of the Russian Armed
Forces (GRU), the Federal Security Service of the
Russian Federation (FSB), and the Foreign Intelligence
Service (SVR) are involved in cyber attacks. It has
also been revealed that the Russian military has its
own cyber command unit.[8] Those are believed to be
responsible for conducting offensive cyber activities,
including dropping malware into command and control
systems of adversaries,[9] with approximately 1,000
personnel. Moreover, Russia revealed, in its National
Security Strategy released in July 2021, its perception
that outer space and information space are under active
development as a new domain for military action, and
declared to reinforce its sovereignty in the information
space as a national priority. In November 2019, the so
called Sovereign Internet Law went into effect to ensure
Russian network’s durability. The law stipulates that the
internet would be cut out from the global network in the
event of a cyber attack or other circumstances.
The United States recognizes Russia as the biggest
ongoing threat in the cyberspace[10] because the country
is refining its spy activities, influence exercise behavior,
and attack capabilities. For example, involvement in the
following incidents have been pointed out.

-  In June 2017, cyber attacks using the so-called
“NotPetya” ransomware occurred in Ukraine and


other countries. In February 2018, the U.S. and U.K.
governments attributed those attacks to the Russian
military.

-  In February 2020, U.S., U.K., Georgian and other
governments announced that the GRU was responsible
for large-scale cyber attacks on Georgian government
agencies and media organizations in October 2019.[11]

-  In October 2020, the U.S. Department of Justice
announced the prosecution of six officers of the GRU
for being involved in cyber attacks on the Ukrainian
power networks in 2015 and 2016 and cyber activities
against the Pyeongchang Olympics in 2017 and 2018.
The U.K. supported the announcement by the U.S.
The U.K. also announced that Russia had conducted
cyber reconnaissance on organizations related to the
Tokyo Olympics and Paralympics in 2020.

-  In December 2020, it became clear that U.S.
government agencies had been exposed to cyber
espionage over a long period of time. In relation to this
case, the U.S. government asserted in January 2021
that the aim of this attack was to collect information,
and in April 2021, the governments of the U.S. and
U.K. announced the attack was by the Foreign
Intelligence Service (SVR).

-  In April 2021, the U.S. Government sanctioned 32
entities and individuals who carried out attempts led
by the Russian Government to influence the 2020
U.S. presidential election, and other information
falsification and interference.

-  The Security Service of Ukraine revealed in
November 2021 that cyber groups related to the
Russian FSB conducted cyber attacks to Ukraine’s
public organizations and critical infrastructure since
2014, with the intention of gaining control of such
infrastructures, conducting intelligence activities
and influence operations, and disturbing Ukraine’s
information systems.

-  In February 2022, the governments of the United
States, the United Kingdom, and Australia pointed out
that the cyber attacks to Ukraine financial institutions
were conducted by Russian GRU.


8 According to the statement made by Russian Minister of Defence Shoigu in an information session for Duma, the lower house, in February 2017. He said that the Russian military has a cyber
command for countering political propaganda in the context of Russia’s ongoing information war with Western countries. However, the minister fell short of naming the command.

in its fifth-generation mobile communications system
development project, while the United Kingdom has
announced its policy to remove all Huawei products
from its fifth-generation mobile communications system
network by the end of 2027.
Moreover, in the midst of the turmoil caused by
COVID-19, cyber attacks that steal information
on vaccine and treatment research data from
pharmaceutical companies and research institutions and
exploit the vulnerability of remote work infrastructure
are frequently occurring. In response to this situation,
NATO issued a statement in June 2020 condemning
malicious cyber activities against those involved in
pandemic responses, including medical and research
institutions.


**4 Trends Concerning Other Threats**

Supply chain risks, including products embedded with
deliberately and fraudulently altered programs, and
the existence of advanced malware designed to attack
industrial control systems are also pointed out.
In this respect, the U.S. Congress in August 2018
passed the National Defense Authorization Act of 2019
including provisions prohibiting government agencies
from using products of major Chinese communications
equipment manufacturers, such as Huawei Technologies
Co. The United States has provided its allies with
information about risks accompanying Chinese
communications equipment and urged them not to use
such equipment. In response, Australia has banned
China’s Huawei and ZTE Corporation from taking part

many countries now view cyber capabilities as tools for
projecting influence and that cyber attacks have become
a key feature of modern conflict. It also notes that the
United States would deter, defend, and when necessary
defeat malicious actors who inflict cyber attacks on the
United States. In response to this, the U.S. DoD in its
National Defense Strategy (January 2018) described
a policy of investing in cyber defense, resilience, and
the continued integration of cyber capabilities into the
full spectrum of military operations. Furthermore, the
DoD Cyber Strategy (September 2018) points out that
the United States is engaged in a long-term strategic
competition with China and Russia, and that China
and Russia have expanded that competition to include
persistent campaigns in and through cyberspace that
pose long-term strategic risk to the United States as well
as to its allies and partners.
The next generation security infrastructure is also
under consideration to enhance cybersecurity in federal
government agencies. For example, in September
2021, the Office of Management and Budget and CISA
released for public comment a document regarding the
zero trust security model.[13]

At the Japan-U.S. “2+2” Meeting in April 2019, the
two countries agreed to strengthen cooperation in the
field of cyberspace, affirming that international law
applies in cyberspace and that a cyber attack could, in
certain circumstances, constitute an armed attack for the
purposes of the Japan-U.S. Security Treaty.
The U.S. Forces include Cyber Command, which
was elevated to a unified combatant command in May
2018 to control cyberspace operations. The Command
consists of the Cyber Protection Force (68 teams),
which operates and defends the DoD Information
Network, the Cyber National Mission Force (13 teams),
which supports the U.S. defense against national-state
threats, and the Cyber Combat Mission Force (27
teams), which supports the operations conducted by
unified combatant commands on the cyber front (these
three Forces are collectively referred to as the Cyber
Mission Force, consisting of 133 teams including 25
support teams, with approximately 6,200 personnel).
In addition, in November 2021, the Cyber Command
conducted “Cyber Flag 21-1”, a multilateral cyber


exercise involving more than 200 cyber personnel from
23 countries, to improve the ability of the United States
and its allies to identify, synchronize, and respond to
malicious cyberspace activities.

**2 Republic of Korea (ROK)**

In December 2018, the ROK released the “National
Security Strategy of the Moon Jae-in Government,”
pledging to enhance cyber threat prevention and
response capabilities based on cooperation among
private, government and military sectors in responding
to cyber threats and to activate relevant international
cooperation. The ROK also formulated its first “National
Cybersecurity Strategy” in April 2019 to protect the
safety of the people and enhance national security, and
released the “National Cybersecurity Basic Plan” to
materialize the strategy in September 2019.
In terms of national defense, the ROK’s military has
established a structure to perform cyber operations led
by the Joint Chiefs of Staff in 2019, while developing
a collaborative system between the Joint Chiefs of
Staff, Cyber Operations Command, and each military
branch in enhancing its cyber operations preparedness
and ensuring effective response to threats in cyberspace.
The Military Cyber Command was restructured into
the Cyber Operations Command in February 2019. In
addition, the Cyber Protection Center of each military
branch was restructured into the Cyber Operations
Center with an increased number of personnel.[14]

**3 Australia**

In the Cyber Security Strategy announced in August
2020, Australia clearly states it will ensure not only its
defense capabilities in cyberspace, but also its authority
and technical strength of offensive capabilities in order
to ensure the country’s network safety. Moreover,
leaders of Australia, the United Kingdom, and the
United States announced in September 2021 to establish
the security cooperation framework AUKUS, in which
they cooperate for a joint development of nuclear
submarines, cyber capabilities, artificial intelligence,
and quantum technology.


13 A security concept based on the view of human nature as fundamentally depraved. In this concept, regardless of something being inside or outside of one’s perimeter, nothing is trusted and
everything is doubted. Users, devices such as terminal units are doubted, or even once authorized access privilege is suspended in a dynamic fashion if there is a high possibility of spoofing etc.
The main targets of defense are assets such as data or devices.

On the organizational front, cybersecurity
capabilities across the government were converged to
establish the Australian Cyber Security Center (ACSC),
which addresses major cybersecurity issues related
to government agencies and critical infrastructure.
In July 2015, the ACSC issued its first report on
cybersecurity, which contends that the number, type,
and sophistication of cyber threats to Australia are all
increasing. Moreover, the Australian Defence Force
created the Information Warfare Division under the
Joint Capabilities Group in July 2017 and established
the Defence Signals Intelligence and Cyber Command
under the division in January 2018. In October 2019,
the Royal Australian Air Force offered to recruit cyber
skills officers to protect networks, data and information
systems.

**4 Europe**

At the NATO Summit in September 2014, an agreement
was reached that NATO’s collective defense applies to
cyber attacks against member states.
On the organizational front, in November 2017, an
agreement was reached on the creation of a new Cyber
Operations Center and the integration of NATO member
countries’ cyber defense capabilities into NATO
missions and operations. The Cyber Operations Center
located in Belgium is expected to be fully operational
with cyber attack capabilities by 2023.
Furthermore, in 2008, the NATO Cooperative
Cyber Defence Centre of Excellence (CCDCOE)
was authorized to serve as a research and training
institution, and was established in Tallinn, the capital
of Estonia. The CCDCOE carries out research on the
relationship between cyber activities and international
law and published the “Tallinn Manual 2.0” in February
2017. The manual takes broad discussion points into
consideration, from peacetime legal regimes, such as
laws on state responsibility, human rights, aviation,
space, and maritime affairs, to contingency legal
regimes, such as laws on armed conflicts. In December
2020, initiatives have started to update this manual to
version 3.0. In December 2019, NATO held its “Cyber
Coalition 2019” exercise, in which Japan officially


participated for the first time with 27 NATO member
states and the EU. In April 2021, Japan also officially
participated for the first time in “Locked Shields 2021,”
a cyber defense exercise hosted by the CCDCOE.
The EU announced its decision to sanction six
individuals of Chinese and Russian nationality and three
organizations from China, North Korea, and Russia that
launched cyber attacks within Europe in July 2020. In
addition, it made a joint announcement with the United
Kingdom in October of the same year that it would
impose sanctions on Russia for cyber attacks on the
German parliament building. In December 2020, the EU
pointed out the lack of collective situational awareness
on cyber threats within the region, and advocated for
the establishment of a cross-disciplinary Joint Cyber
Unit between the private, diplomatic, police and defense
sectors in the EU’s Cybersecurity Strategy for the Digital
Decade. In June 2021, a concrete structural conception
of this Joint Cyber unit was announced.
The United Kingdom held up five strategic objectives
including detection, disruption, and deterrence of
adversaries in its National Cyber Strategy published in
December of the same year, and announced to invest 2.6
billion pounds to the cyber field in the next three years.
On the organizational front, in October 2016, the
National Cyber Security Centre (NCSC) was newly
established under the Government Communications
Headquarters (GCHQ) to promote public-private
partnerships for responses to national cyber incidents.
Moreover, the 13th Signal Regiment was established
in June 2020 for the protection of military networks.
In November 2020, the establishment of the National
Cyber Force (NCF) was announced, which consolidates
personnel from GCHQ, the Ministry of Defence, and
others to carry out activities such as preventing serious
crimes and disrupting adversary weapon systems.
France established their Cyber Defense Command
under the Chief of the Defence Staff in May 2017. In
September 2021, Minister of the Armed Forces Parly
announced to increase the Command’s troop strength to
around 5,000 members by 2025 to strengthen France’s
cyber defense capabilities, pointing out the increase and
the severity of cyber attacks to the country.

**Each Country’s Electronic Warfare Initiatives**
**2**

**1 The United States and Europe** **2 China**


The United States is committed to expanding electronic
warfare training and equipment and to enhancing
cooperation with its allies under an initiative to
aggressively achieve its dominance in the electromagnetic
domain. In addition, the Electromagnetic Spectrum
Superiority Strategy announced by the U.S. Department
of Defense in October 2020, indicates the recognition
of importance to ensure freedom of action in the
electromagnetic spectrum for the success of operations
in all areas.
As an example of military operations using electronic
warfare equipment, it is pointed out that the LMADIS
(Light Marine Air Defense System) counter unmanned
aircraft system with electronic warfare capabilities was
used for leading an Iranian drone to crash over the Strait
of Hormuz in July 2019.
The United States Army announced in September
2021 that a multidomain unit having space, cyber
domain and electronic warfare functions was deployed
in Germany. Also, the United States Air Force newly
organized the 350th Spectrum Warfare Wing in June
2021 to integrate all capabilities for electronic warfare
and electromagnetic spectrum into just one unit.
Many other NATO member states are also developing
equipment for severe electronic warfare environments
and allegedly conducting electronic warfare-oriented
exercises with Russian forces’ electronic warfare
equipment in mind.[1] For example, France conducted
the multilateral military exercise “Polaris 21” from
November to December 2021 to prepare malfunctioning
situations caused by enemy’s cyber warfare or electronic
warfare.


attacks.

**2 China**

China has set an initiative to put cyber warfare and other
electronic elements, and physical destruction and other
non-electronic elements, under unified control.[2] Also, it
has been pointed out that its electronic warfare strategy
is focused on controlling, deteriorating, damaging, and
deceiving enemy electronic equipment.[3] Under the
initiative, China conducts force-on-force exercises on
a routine basis to effectively accomplish missions in
complicated electromagnetic environments, improving
practical capabilities. It is pointed out that China’s armed
forces have taken advantage of such exercises to assess
electronic warfare weapon research and development
achievements.[4] The Strategic Support Force, established
at the end of 2015 for improving overall military
operational capabilities, is said to be responsible for
such domains as electronic warfare, cyber and space.
China’s Tu-154 intelligence and Y-8 electronic
warfare aircraft have been seen flying around the Nansei
Islands and the Sea of Japan in the vicinity of Japan.
Furthermore, in August 2021, Y-9 information collection
and Y-9 patrol aircraft, together with unmanned
reconnaissance / attack aircraft TB-001 and unmanned
reconnaissance aircraft BZK-005, flew from the East
China Sea, over the gap between the Okinawa Islands
and Miyakojima Island, to the Pacific Ocean. In the
South China Sea, it is also reported that China deployed
a radio wave interference apparatus on Mischief Reef
of the Spratly Islands,[5] and aircraft including the KJ500 early warning aircraft were observed on Fiery Cross
Reef.

military conflicts. Moreover, according to a Russian
military organ’s contributed article of April 2021,
Russia will ensure superiority in weapon guidance as
well as force command by improving electronic warfare
technology and expanding equipment, in response to
the technological superiority of developed countries
that have advanced information and communication
technology. It is pointed out that Russia has improved
its practical ability in electronic warfare in the past few
years[6] as it has reportedly conducted practice in military
exercises such as “Vostok 2018” in September 2018 and
“Tsentr 2019” in September 2019.
In the Russian Forces, there are reportedly five
electronic warfare brigades. They mainly consist of the
Land Forces[7] and possess multiple types of electronic
warfare equipment. Furthermore, Russia is developing
and deploying electronic warfare (EW) systems with
artificial intelligence such as EW system Bylina that
controls many EW equipment in an integrated way and
EW system Palantin that reportedly can interfere with
radio communications and electronic reconnaissance
systems within a range of 1,000km. In the vicinity of
Japan, Russian electronic reconnaissance aircraft’s
long-range flights over the Sea of Japan have been seen.

claimed by China, and determined the illegality of
China’s activities such as land reclamation. However,
China has clearly stated its intention not to comply
with the award and has continued the militarization of
the features by developing military facilities such as
batteries and various infrastructures that can be used for
military purposes, such as runways, harbors, hangars and
radar facilities, and by deploying military aircraft and
conducting air trainings such as taking off and landing.
These activities may result in a significant improvement
of Chinese operational conducting capability within the
South China Sea. It has been pointed out that if China
were to consider bastion operations (fortification) to
enhance the survivability of new type of long-range
SLBMs capable of targeting the U.S. mainland, the
South China Sea would be the suitable choice.[2]

Moreover, in July and August 2016 after the
arbitration award between the Philippines and China
was rendered, an H-6K bomber of the PLA Air Force
(PLAAF) conducted combat air patrols in the airspace
around Scarborough Shoal, with China’s Ministry of
National Defense announcing that it would conduct
these patrols regularly from now on. Furthermore, it is
to be believed that China conducted military exercises
and launch experiments for ballistic missiles. These
show the PLA has been intensifying its operations in the
South China Sea.
In a dangerous act that could cause unintended
consequences, PLA Navy and other ships approached
and obstructed a U.S. Navy ship sailing in the South
China Sea in September 2018.
Furthermore, China is using methods other than its
military. For example, in some cases the China Coast
Guard patrol vessels obstructed foreign fisher boats
approaching the features by firing warning shots or
water cannons at them, and it is pointed out that maritime
militia is active.[3] Furthermore, China unilaterally
announced the establishment of administrative districts
called “Xisha District” and “Nansha District” under
Sansha City of Hainan Province in April 2020.
In response to these actions by China, critical
voices are being raised by others besides claimants.
For example, in July 2020 the United States issued a


statement from the U.S. Secretary of State saying that
China’s maritime claims in the South China Sea are
unlawful. The State Department also released a report,
in January 2022, about the way that China’s unlawful
claims of territorial rights and jurisdiction gravely
undermine the rule of law in the oceans.

**(3) Unintended Contingency Avoidance Initiatives**
Despite these numerous acts that could pose risks
to securing the stable use of oceans and airspace, in
recent years progress has been made in efforts to avert
and prevent unintended consequences in the seas and
skies. First, at the Japan-China summit meeting held
on May 9, 2018, Japan and China agreed to establish
a “Maritime and Aerial Communication Mechanism
between the Defense Authorities of Japan and China”
with the aim of avoiding unintended confrontations
between the naval vessels and aircraft of the SDF and
PLA. The mechanism went into operation in June of the
same year.
As for multi-national initiatives, in April 2014, navies
of participating countries of the Western Pacific Naval
Symposium (WPNS), including Japan, the United
States, and China, adopted the Code for Unplanned
Encounters at Sea (CUES).[4] CUES sets forth a code
of conduct such as procedures and communication
method to ensure safety for unexpected encounters by
vessels or aircraft of the navies of these countries. In
November 2014, the United States and China agreed on
measures pertaining to mutual notification of military
activities, together with rules of behavior to avert
collisions in waters and airspace in accordance with
CUES and other frameworks. In September 2015, the
two countries announced an agreement concerning an
additional annex stipulating rules of behavior to avert
air encounters. Between ASEAN and China, official
discussions have been held for the establishment of the
Code of the Conduct of Parties in the South China Sea
(COC).
It is strongly hoped that these initiatives designed to
avert and prevent unintended consequences in the seas
and skies will supplement the existing international
order and that the countries concerned, including China,
refrain from unilateral actions that add to tension and


According to the annual report “Military and Security Developments Involving the People’s Republic of China,” U.S. DoD (2021).

For example, the Philippines’ Department of National Defense expressed deep concern over the presence of 220 Chinese maritime militia vessels around Whitsun Reef, and demanded immediate
withdrawal in March 2021.

The Middle East has seen intermittent attacks on ships
in recent years.
For example, in the Strait of Hormuz and its vicinity,
attacks on private sector oil tankers have been seen
since May 2019. As tensions including those over U.S.Iran relations have increased in the Middle East, U.S.
and French initiatives have been conducted to secure
safe navigation.


based in Bahrain. So far, the United States, Australia, the
United Kingdom, Turkey, the ROK, Pakistan and other
countries have participated in the CTF151, conducting
zone defense operations to counter piracy. The EU for its
part has conducted Operation Atalanta to counter piracy
since December 2008. In the operation, naval vessels
and aircraft dispatched by EU member countries escort
ships and monitor the waters off the coast of Somalia. It
has been decided that the operation will continue until
the end of 2022.
In addition, some countries have conducted their
exclusive operations outside the abovementioned
frameworks. Since December 2008, for example,
China has deployed naval vessels for counter-piracy
operations in waters off the coast of Somalia and in the
Gulf of Aden.
While the number of piracy incidents in waters off the
coast of Somalia and in the Gulf of Aden has remained
low thanks primarily to such international initiatives,
Somalia’s unstable security and poverty as fundamental
factors behind piracy have not been resolved.
Meanwhile, in Africa, piracy incidents occurred in
the Gulf of Guinea (the number of incidents was 35
in 2021). The international community has continued
counter-piracy initiatives in this region.
The number of piracy incidents in Southeast Asian
waters came to 56 in 2021. Traditionally, maritime
armed robbery incidents, including the theft of cash,
crewmembers’ belongings, ship equipment and other
items, have accounted for most of piracy incidents in the
waters. In recent years, however, they included grave
incidents in which crewmembers were kidnapped for
ransom purposes in the Sulu Sea and the Celebes Sea
off the Philippines.



Chapter 3, Section 10-2 (Situation in the Gulf Region)


See


**(2) Piracy**
Piracy seen at various locations has become a threat to
maritime traffic. The number of piracy / armed robbery
incidents (hereinafter referred to as “piracy incidents”)[5]
is declining after the peak of 445 incidents in 2010.
(There were 132 incidents in 2021.)
The decline has depended heavily on the fall in the
number of piracy incidents in waters off the coast of
Somalia and in the Gulf of Aden.
The number of piracy incidents in waters off the
coast of Somalia and in the Gulf of Aden rose rapidly
from 2008 to 2011 with 237 incidents, accounting for
more than half of the global total and attracting great
international concern as a threat to safe navigation. In the
recent years, however, the number of piracy incidents in
waters off the coast of Somalia and in the Gulf of Aden
has remained low as a result of various initiatives taken
by the international community including Japan. (There
was one incident in 2021. Refer to Part III, Chapter 3,
Section 2-2 (Counter-Piracy Operations) for Japan’s
initiatives.)
The international counter-piracy initiatives in waters
off the coast of Somalia and in the Gulf of Aden include
counter-piracy operations by the Combined Task Force
151 (CTF151), a multinational force that was created by
the U.S. Force-led Combined Maritime Force (CMF)[6]


The numbers of piracy incidents cited in the main text are based on a report by the International Maritime Bureau of the International Chamber of Commerce.

The CMF is a multinational force, which operates to promote maritime security, stability, and prosperity, under the U.S. Central Command. Forces from 34 countries participate in the CMF, and the
Commander of the U.S. Fifth Fleet concurrently serves as the CMF Commander. The CMF is comprised of four combined task forces: the Combined Task Group 150 which is tasked with maritime
security operations in the Indian Ocean and the Gulf of Oman, the Combined Task Group 151 which is tasked with counter-piracy operations, the Combined Task Group 152 which is tasked with
maritime security operations in the Persian Gulf, and the Combined Task Group 153 (established in April 2022) which is tasked with maritime security and capacity building operations from the
Red Sea to the Gulf of Aden. The SDF deploy units to the Combined Task Group 151 (CTF151). Furthermore, in June 2021, the CMF reorganized the Combined Task Force into the Combined Task

The area north of latitude 66 degrees 33 minutes is called conducted a long-distance navigation to the Novo

Denmark, Finland, Iceland, Norway, Russia, Sweden
and the United States. These eight are called Arctic
countries. In 1996, the Arctic countries established the
Arctic Council to promote cooperation in their common
challenges, including sustainable development and
environmental protection in the Arctic Region.
In recent years, moves towards the utilization of transArctic navigation routes and the development of natural
resources in the Arctic Ocean have gained momentum
in line with a decline in sea ice. From the perspective of
security, the Arctic Ocean has traditionally been used for
the deployment of strategic nuclear forces and as their
transit route. With the decrease in sea ice in recent years,
ships have been able to navigate for a longer period of
time and more extensively than before. It is therefore
considered that the region could be used for deploying
maritime forces or maneuvering military forces in the
future. In this situation, moves to deploy new military
capabilities in the ocean are seen.
In the “Russian Federation’s National Security
Strategy”, revised in December 2015, and in “Strategy
for Developing the Russian Arctic Zone and Ensuring
National Security through 2035”, revised in October
2020, Russia continues to maintain that it would secure
its interests in resource development and use of sea
routes.
Russia has been developing natural gas on the Yamal
Peninsula and elsewhere. In 2018, liquefied natural gas
produced on the peninsula was transported to China for
the first time via an Arctic Ocean route. As for military
arrangements, in January 2021, Russia upgraded the
Northern Fleet to a military-administered district citing
that it will enable the enhancement of joint operations in
the Arctic. Moreover, 13 airfield construction plans are
in progress, and radar networks as well as anti-air/antiship missiles are being deployed in the Arctic region. As
for military operations, the Northern Fleet has annually


conducted a long-distance navigation to the Novo
Sibirski Islands since 2012. Russia has intensified other
Arctic military operations including SSBN submarines’
strategic nuclear deterrence patrols and long-range
bombers’ patrol flights. The commander-in-chief of
the Russian Navy reported to President Putin in March
2021 that three SSBN successfully surfaced through
the polar ice simultaneously during the Arctic exercise
“Umka-2021.”
In its Arctic Strategy published in June 2019, the
U.S. DoD expressed concern against actions of China
and Russia in the Arctic region[7] and a desire for the
Arctic to become a secure and stable region where U.S.
national interests are safeguarded, the U.S. homeland
is protected, and nations work cooperatively to address
challenges. The U.S. Marine forces were deployed in
Norway on a rotation basis every year for a period of
six months for training since 2017, but this rotation
deployment has been changed to a form of dispatching
forces with a larger number of personnel for a shorter
period of time in conjunction with training since October
2020. In October 2018, the U.S. sent an aircraft carrier
to the Arctic Region for the first time in 27 years for air
drills in the Norwegian Sea ahead of the NATO exercise
“Trident Juncture 2018.” In May 2020, United States
and United Kingdom vessels took part in activities in
the Barents Sea for the first time since the end of the
Cold War. Moreover, U.S. B-1 bomber made their first
landing inside the Arctic Circle in March 2021.
Aside from coastal states in the Arctic Ocean, 13
countries including Japan, China, the ROK, the United
Kingdom, Germany and France, have observer status
in the Arctic Council. Notably, China has shown active
involvement in the Arctic Ocean, deploying the polar
research vessel Xue Long to the Arctic Ocean for 12
times since 1999.[8] In January 2018, they published
a white paper titled “China’s Arctic Policy” in which
they claimed to be one of the geographically closest
states to the Arctic Circle with rights pertaining to


As for Russia, the U.S. DoD pointed out in its Arctic Strategy that Russia is strengthening its presence above the Arctic Circle by deploying Arctic units and establishing new military bases.
Moreover, Russia has reportedly threatened to use force against vessels that fail to abide by Russian regulations. The DoD pointed out that Russia could utilize its military capabilities in an effort
to deny access to disputed Arctic waters or resources. As for China, the DoD pointed out in its strategy that its operations of icebreaking vessels and civilian research activities could support a
future Chinese military presence in the Arctic Ocean including deployment of submarines to the region, and also pointed out that it was attempting to gain a role in the Arctic in ways that may
undermine international rules and norms, and there is a risk that its predatory economic behavior globally may be repeated in the Arctic.

In 2012, Xue Long became the first polar research vessel to sail across the Arctic Ocean. In 2013, the cargo freighter Yong Sheng became the first Chinese commercial ship to cross the Arctic
Ocean. Canadian scientists took part in Xue Long’s voyage to the Arctic Ocean in 2017, and they succeeded for the first time in trial navigation of the Arctic Northwest Passage (along the north
coast of Canada). Its second polar research vessel Xue Long 2 completed its first Arctic Sea navigation in September 2020. Furthermore, China is accelerating research and construction of a

their intention to build a “Polar Silk Road.” China
also specified it will construct this “Polar Silk Road”

and accelerates its participation to international ocean

Arctic Region have gathered attention as, for example,
in September 2015, five Chinese naval vessels transited

Pacific, as well as in the U.S. territorial waters near the
Aleutian Islands.
Apart from that, in October 2021, the EU unveiled

missiles as a weapon which is comparatively easy for
terrorists and other non-state actors to acquire and has
the potential for proliferation. Because cruise missiles
are cheaper to produce compared to ballistic missiles
and are easy to maintain and train with, many countries
either produce or modify cruise missiles. Moreover,
because of cruise missiles’ relatively higher target
accuracy, their difficulty to be detected while flying,
and their relatively smaller size compared to ballistic
missiles, they can be concealed on a ship to secretly
approach a target, and they can present a serious threat
if they carry WMDs with their warheads.

**Growing Concerns about Transfer and Proliferation of WMDs and Other Technologies**
**4**

Even weapons that were purchased or developed for technology, had been transferred to North Korea, Iran,

Pakistan. It has also been suggested that North Korea
supported Syria’s secret nuclear activities.[5]

Furthermore, there has been significant transfer and
proliferation of ballistic missiles that serve as means
of weapon delivery. The former Soviet Union and
other countries exported Scud-B to many countries and
regions, including Iraq, North Korea, and Afghanistan.
China and North Korea also exported DF-3 (CSS-2) and
Scud missiles, respectively. As a result, a considerable
number of countries and other actors now possess
ballistic missiles. For example, in recent years, the
opposition insurgent group Houthis, based in Northern
Yemen, sporadically attacks Saudi Arabia and the
United Arab Emirates (UAE) with ballistic missiles and
other weapons. It is pointed out that the group receives
their weapons from Iran.[6]

It is pointed out that North Korea continues to be
an outward source of proliferation of technologies,
conventional weapons and items for supply chains
related to WMDs. For example, it has been pointed out
that the Transporter-Erector-Launcher (TEL) for two
types of short-range ballistic missile test launched in
2019 were in sand or tan color for marketing purposes.[7]
It has also been pointed out that North Korea cooperates
with Iran to develop long range missiles.[8]

North Korea made rapid strides in the development

The deployment of ballistic missiles in areas with
continuous armed conflicts is dangerous because it can
intensify existing tensions and make the area unstable.
Furthermore, ballistic missiles are used as a means of
attacking from a distance or threatening another country
that has superior conventional forces.
In recent years, along with the threat of ballistic
missiles, analysts have pointed to the threat of cruise

**4**

Even weapons that were purchased or developed for
self-defense purposes could easily be exported or
transferred once domestic manufacturing becomes
successful. For example, certain states that do not heed
political risks have transferred WMDs and related
technologies to other states that cannot afford to invest
resources in conventional forces and attempt to offset
this with WMDs. Some of these states that seek WMDs
do not hesitate to put their land and people at risk, and
furthermore, due to their weak governance, terrorist
organizations are active in their territories. Therefore,
it is conceivable that in general, the possibility of actual
use of WMDs would increase.
Moreover, since it is uncertain whether such states can
effectively manage the related technology and materials,
there is a concern that chemical or nuclear substances
will be transferred or smuggled out from these states
with high likelihood. For example, there is a danger that
even terrorists who do not possess related technologies
would use a dirty bomb to release radioactive materials
for pollution as a means of terrorist attack so long as
they gain access to such materials. States across the
world share concerns regarding the acquisition and use
of WMDs by terrorists and other nonstate actors.
The proliferation of WMDs and other related
technologies has been noted in numerous instances. For
example, in February 2004, it came to light that nuclearrelated technologies, mainly uranium enrichment

of its ballistic missiles with only a few test launches in
the 1980s and 1990s. It is believed that an underlying
factor behind this fact was North Korea’s imports of
various materials and technologies from outside of
North Korea. It is also noted that North Korea transfers
ballistic missile airframes and related technologies and
accelerates the further development of missiles using
funds procured through such transfer.[9]

The pressure from the international society’s decisive
attitude to the nations involved in transferring and
proliferation of WMDs etc. has resulted in some nations
to accept inspections by international organizations.
Meanwhile, it is pointed out that, in recent years, states
in which transferring is a concern have sustained their
external transfer while skillfully averting international
monitoring by falsifying documentation and diversifying
transport routes to illicitly export WMDs. Additionally,
intangible technology transfer has arisen as a cause
for concern. Namely, those states have obtained
advanced technologies which could be adapted for the
development and manufacturing of WMDs and other
technologies via their nationals-researchers and students
who have been dispatched to leading companies and
academic institutions in developed countries.

Regarding the direct impact of climate change on on initiatives


-----

The DoD published its first report focused on the
strategic risks of climate change, the Department of
Defense Climate Risk Analysis, in October 2021. This
report explains how to integrate the considerations
of climate change into its strategies, plans, major
documents including budgets, and engagements with
allies or partners. It mentions the National Defense
Strategy (NDS) and others as documents into which
climate consideration will be incorporated.
The U.S. Forces conducted its first climate and
environmental security tabletop exercise set in East
Africa in March 2021. In this exercise, it is hypothesized
that climate change had gradually disrupted natural
systems, weakening region-states, and increasing the
risk of climate-driven extreme events, based upon
future climate, economic, and population forecasts. In
this scenario, high-end conventional combat capabilities
were of little use, while the value of the exercise to
understand the links between climate change and global
security was emphasized.
The DoD is developing a sustainability plan to meet
net zero emissions by 2050, and will set a path for
enhancing sustainable procurement on supply chains. In
particular, the DoD is, together with some companies,
considering ways to ensure a healthy supply chain for
lithium ion batteries, which are essential to military
systems and future capabilities like directed energy
weapons and hybrid electric tactical vehicles, while the
supply chain is dominated by China.
Furthermore, the DoD has been assessing the
vulnerability of U.S. military installations and operations
worldwide to climate change. In April 2021, a report[1]
was published about the impact of climate change on
the DoD installations at home and abroad. Using the
DoD Climate Assessment Tool,[2] exposure to climate
change hazards to 1391 DoD installations at home and
abroad are assessed, and each department of the Army,
Navy, and Air Forces are also evaluated.
In addition, the DoD included US$617 million
in its FY 2022 budget request for measures to deal
with climate crisis such as strengthening resilience of
installations, improving energy efficiency of equipment
and facilities, and investing in science and technology.


The Leaders Summit on Climate hosted by the United States [NATO]

It is seen that the DoD will continue to secure financial
resources to tackle and complete various initiatives to
mitigate and adapt to climate change.
The United Kingdom, which was the chair country
for the 26th session of the Conference of the Parties to
the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate
Change (COP26) held from October to November
2021, is also showing an increasingly positive attitude.
According to a policy document[3] published by the
Ministry of Defence (MoD) in March 2021, UK
government will make tackling climate change and
biodiversity loss its number one international priority in
2021 and beyond, and sets three linked objectives which
are adaptation and resilience, sustainability and net
zero, and global leadership as its “Defence’s strategic
ambition 2050.” To achieve these ambitions, the MoD
divides its approach until 2050 into three phases. In the
first phase for 2021 to 2025, it will set the foundations,
which include identifying ways to reduce emissions in
the supply chain and building a comprehensive baseline
and database to allow decisions on a detailed plan for all
themes dealt during other phases. A number of concrete
plans for this initial phase is introduced.
Furthermore, International cooperation is also
developing.
In April 2021, the Climate Security Session was held
at the Leaders Summit on Climate hosted by the United
States. The session, moderated by U.S. Secretary of
Defense Austin, was attended by Minister of Defense

United Kingdom, and the minister of finance of the
Philippines, to discuss global security issues caused by
climate change and their countermeasures. During the
discussions, defense officials noted that their ministries
are increasingly called upon to respond to disasters thus
elevating the need for enhanced disaster preparedness
and response. In addition, they described the benefits
of collaboration between defense ministers on shared
climate crisis.
NATO has held up its ‘Green Defense’ framework
seeking to make NATO operationally effective through
changes in the use of energy, while also meeting the
environmental objectives of using less resources
and enhancing sustainability. NATO stated in the
communique of its summit meeting held in June 2021 that
it aims to become the leading international organization
when it comes to understanding and adapting to the


impact of climate change on security. Moreover, an
action plan set out a framework for delivering NATO’s
agenda on climate change and security was adopted
during the meeting. It is stated that, as part of the action
plan, NATO will 1) increase awareness and conduct
impact assessment for it; 2) adapt to climate change; 3)
contribute to the mitigation of climate change; and 4)
strengthen exchanges with partner countries, as well as
with international and regional organizations including
the EU, the UN and others. NATO will submit the
Climate Change and Security Progress Report at the
2022 Summit.
It is strictly required for the international society to
unify their efforts against climate change, which is in
progress worldwide and is even referred to as a threat
multiplier. It is also needed to pay close attention to
future efforts against climate change with great interest.

**4 Securing Civilian Control**

Civilian control refers to the priority of politics to the
military in a democratic state or democratic political
control of military strength. Japan has, by giving serious
reflection to the regrettable state of affairs that happened
until the end of World War II, adopted the following
strict civilian control system that is entirely different
from the one under the former Constitution.[3] Civilian
control aims to ensure that the SDF is maintained and
operated in accordance with the will of the people.
The Diet, which represents Japanese nationals,
makes legislative and budgetary decisions on such
matters as the allotted number of the SDF personnel and
main organizations of the Ministry of Defense (MOD)/
SDF. It also issues approval for defense operations of
the SDF. The function of national defense entirely falls
under the executive power of the Cabinet as a general
administrative function. The Constitution requires that
the Prime Minister and other Ministers of State who
constitute the Cabinet be civilians. The Prime Minister,
on behalf of the whole Cabinet, holds the authority of
supreme command and supervision of the SDF. The
Minister of Defense, who is exclusively in charge
of national defense, exercises general control and


supervises over the SDF duties. In addition, the National
Security Council of Japan under the Cabinet deliberates
important matters on national security.
At the MOD, the Minister of Defense takes charge of
and manages the matters concerning national defense,
and as the competent minister also manages and operates
the SDF. The Minister of Defense is assisted in policy
planning and political affairs by the State Minister of
Defense, the Parliamentary Vice-Ministers of Defense
(two) and the Senior Adviser to the Minister of Defense.
In addition, the Special Adviser to the Minister of
Defense provides the Minister of Defense with advice
on important affairs under the jurisdiction of the MOD
based on their expertise and experience. The Defense
Council consisting of political appointees, civilian
officials and uniformed SDF personnel deliberates on
basic principles concerning affairs under the Ministry’s
jurisdiction. Through these ways, the MOD aims to
further ensure civilian control.
As mentioned above, the civilian control system
is well established. However, in order to ensure that
the system achieves good results, it is necessary to
continue making practical efforts in both political and
administrative aspects, along with a deep interest in
national defense taken by the people.

The Japan-U.S. Security Arrangements constitute
a cornerstone for Japan’s national security, and the
Japan-U.S. Alliance plays a significant role for the
peace, stability and prosperity of the international
community. In this context, Japan needs to press ahead
with such efforts as bolstering the ability of the JapanU.S. Alliance to deter and counter threats, enhancing
and expanding cooperation in a wide range of areas,
and steadily implementing measures concerning the
stationing of U.S. Forces in Japan.

|Roles|Outline|
|From peacetime to “gray-zone” situations|● The SDF will, in close integration with diplomacy, promote strategic communications including bilateral/multilateral training/exercises and overseas port visits on a steady-state basis. ● The SDF will conduct persistent intelligence, surveillance and reconnaissance (ISR) activities around Japan. The SDF will prevent the occurrence or escalation of emergencies by employing flexible deterrent options and other measures. ● The SDF will, in coordination with the police and other agencies, immediately take appropriate measures in response to actions that violate Japan’s sovereignty including incursions into its territorial airspace and waters.|
|Attack against Japan including its remote islands|● The SDF will quickly maneuver and deploy requisite units to block access and landing of invading forces while ensuring maritime and air superiority. ● Even when maintaining maritime and air superiority becomes untenable, the SDF will block invading forces’ access and landing from outside their threat envelopes. ● Should any part of the territory be occupied, the SDF will retake it by employing all necessary measures. ● Against airborne attack by missiles and aircraft, the SDF will respond in a swift and sustained manner by applying optimal means and minimize damage to maintain SDF’s capabilities as well as the infrastructure upon which such capabilities are employed. ● In response to attack by guerrillas or special operations forces, the SDF will protect critical facilities including nuclear power plants and search and destroy infiltrating forces.|
|Space, cyber and electromagnetic domains during all phases|● To prevent any actions that impede its activities, the SDF will conduct, on a steady-state basis, persistent monitoring as well as collection and analysis of relevant information. ● In case of an event that impedes its activities, the SDF will promptly take such measures as damage limitation and recovery. ● In case of armed attack against Japan, the SDF will block and eliminate the attack by leveraging capabilities in space, cyber and electromagnetic domains. ● The SDF will contribute to comprehensive, whole-of-government efforts concerning these domains under appropriate partnership and shared responsibility with relevant organizations.|
|Large-scale disasters|● The SDF will swiftly transport and deploy requisite units to take all necessary measures for initial response, and, as required, maintain its posture for disaster response for a longer term. ● The SDF will carefully address the needs of affected citizens and local governments. ● The SDF will engage in life saving, temporary repair and livelihood support in appropriate partnership and cooperation with relevant organizations, local governments and the private sector.|
|Collaboration with the United States based on the Japan-U.S. Alliance|● In all stages from peacetime to armed contingencies, Japan will effectively conduct activities by playing on its initiative its own roles in the Japan-U.S. Alliance.|


Promotion of security -  The SDF will strategically promote defense cooperation and exchanges such as joint training and exercises, cooperation in defense equipment

and multilayered security cooperation, taking into
account the characteristics and situation specific to
each region and country. As part of such efforts, Japan
will actively leverage its defense capability to work
on defense cooperation and exchanges which include
bilateral/multilateral training and exercises, defense
equipment and technology cooperation, capacity
building assistance, and service-to-service exchanges.


Furthermore, Japan will also contribute to address
global security challenges. Moreover, in implementing
these initiatives, Japan will position the Japan-U.S.
Alliance as its cornerstone and will work closely with
the countries that share universal values and security
interests, through full coordination with its diplomatic
policy.

of the SDF for the Minister of Defense from a military
expert’s perspective. The Ground Staff, Maritime Staff
and Air Staff are the staff organizations for the Minister
of Defense concerning their respective services except
operations of the SDF, with the Chiefs of Staff for the
Ground Self-Defense Force (GSDF), the Maritime SelfDefense Force (MSDF) and the Air Self-Defense Force
(ASDF) acting as the top ranking expert advisers to the
Minister of Defense regarding these services.
In this manner, the MOD has ensured that the support
for the Minister from a policy perspective and the support
for the Minister from a military expert’s perspective are
provided in a well-balanced manner like the two wheels of
a cart, so to speak, in order for the Minister of Defense to
appropriately make decisions.

See Chapter 1, Section 2-3-4 (Securing Civilian Control)

**3** **Base of Defense Administration in Regional Areas**

The MOD has Regional Defense Bureaus in eight locations
across the country (Sapporo City, Sendai City, Saitama
City, Yokohama City, Osaka City, Hiroshima City, Fukuoka
City, and Kadena Town) as its local branch in charge of
comprehensive defense administration.
In addition to implementing measures to harmonize
between defense facilities and regional societies and
inspecting equipment, the Regional Defense Bureaus carry
out various measures to obtain the understanding and
cooperation of both local governments and local residents
towards the MOD/SDF activities.


**2** **Systems to Support the Minister of Defense**

The Minister of Defense takes charge of and manages the
matters related to the defense of Japan as the competent
minister, and is in overall charge of the SDF duties in
accordance with the provisions of the SDF Law. The
Minister is supported by the State Minister of Defense,
the Parliamentary Vice-Ministers of Defense (two) and
the Senior Adviser to the Minister of Defense. There are
also the Special Advisers to the Minister of Defense, who
advise the Minister of Defense, and the Defense Council,
which deliberates on basic principles concerning affairs
under the Ministry’s jurisdiction. Furthermore, there are the
Administrative Vice-Minister of Defense, who organizes
and supervises the administrative affairs of each bureau
and organization to support the Minister of Defense, and
the Vice-Minister of Defense for International Affairs, who
is responsible for the overall coordination of duties such as
those related to international affairs.
Moreover, the Internal Bureaus of the MOD, Joint Staff,
Ground Staff Office, Maritime Staff Office, Air Staff Office,
and the Acquisition, Technology & Logistics Agency
(ATLA), as an external bureau, have been established in the
MOD. The Internal Bureaus of the MOD are responsible for
basic policy relating to the duties of the SDF. The DirectorsGeneral of the Minister’s Secretariat and the DirectorsGeneral of each Bureau within the Internal Bureaus, along
with the Commissioner of ATLA who is in charge of defense
equipment administration, support the Minister of Defense
by providing assistance from a policy perspective.
The Joint Staff is a staff organization for the Minister of
Defense concerning the operation of the SDF. The Chief of
Joint Staff provides centralized support for the operations

**Joint Operations System of the SDF**
**2**

In order to rapidly and effectively fulfill the duties of where a single SDF unit is employed to respond.

the SDF, the MOD/SDF has adopted the joint operations
system in which the GSDF, the MSDF, and the ASDF
operate integrally. Furthermore, it works toward
building an architecture that is capable of realizing
cross-domain operations including new domains, which
are space, cyberspace, and electromagnetic spectrum.

**1 Outline of Joint Operations System**

**(1) Role of Chief of Joint Staff**
a. The Chief of Joint Staff develops a joint operations concept
for SDF operations, and centrally supports the MOD on
SDF operations from a military expert’s perspective.
b. The Minister’s commands concerning the operations
of the SDF are delivered through the Chief of Joint
Staff, and orders concerning operations of the SDF
are executed by the Chief of Joint Staff. In doing this,
the Minister’s commands and orders are delivered
through the Chief of Joint Staff not only in cases
where a joint task force[2] is organized, but also in cases


**(2) Relationship between Chief of Joint Staff, and**
**Other Chiefs of Staff**

The Joint Staff undertakes functions relating to the
operations of the SDF, while the Ground, Maritime
and Air Staff Offices undertake functions for unit
maintenance, such as personnel affairs, building-up
defense capability, and education and training.

See Fig. II-3-2-5 (Operational System of the SDF and Roles of the

Chief of Joint Staff and the Chiefs of Staff of the Ground,
Maritime, and Air Self-Defense Forces)

**2** **Strengthening Joint Operational Functions**

In order to realize cross-domain operations based on
the Current NDPG, the Joint Staff’s posture designed
for efficient force operations and for new domains is
being strengthened, thereby enabling swift and effective
exercise of the SDF’s total capabilities. In addition, the
future framework for joint operations is being examined.

items such as wages and meals for SDF personnel, measures to alleviate the impact on local communities
and “material expenses,” which finance the repair hosting U.S. bases in Japan. As such, a high percentage

4 Some projects for build-up of defense capabilities extend over multiple years. In these cases, the fiscal year in which the contract is concluded is different from the fiscal year in which the
payment to the contractor is made. Therefore, the maximum obligation over later fiscal years is first allocated to the budget as a contract resulting in a Treasury obligation (a type of budget that
only grants the authority to incur obligations; the contracts can be concluded, but payment cannot be made). Based on such budgeting, in the fiscal year in which the construction is completed or
the equipment is procured, expenses necessary for payment are allocated as budget expenditure, in principle (type of budget that grants authorities to incur obligations and make payment; the
contracts can be concluded and the payment can be made). Budget expenditure for payments incurred under contracts concluded in previous fiscal years is called “obligatory outlay expenses,”
while expenditure for future fiscal years is termed “future obligation.”

For cases where a continued project over multiple years is necessary, there is also a system of continuing expenditure as a means to grant the authority to incur obligations and make payment

beyond (the amount of future obligation arising in
the applicable fiscal year). In the build-up of defense
capabilities, it is common to take multiple years from
contract to delivery or completion, in areas such as
the procurement of vessels, aircraft, and other primary
equipment, as well as the construction of buildings such
as aircraft hangars and barracks. Concerning these,
contracts covering multiple fiscal years are concluded
in the fiscal year in question, and payments for the next


fiscal year and beyond (in principle, within five years)
are promised in advance at the time of concluding the
contract (the total of general material expenses and
future obligation concerning new contracts is the total
amount of the contract amount concluded in the fiscal
year in question (scale of operations), and is referred to
as the “contract basis”).

Amount of future obligation

When improving defense capabilities, it is common for work in areas like the procurement of
equipment and the upgrading of facilities to be carried out over several years. Consequently, a
procedure is undertaken whereby a contract that extends for multiple years is arranged (five
years in principle), and the government promises in advance at the time of the agreement to
make the payment at a fixed time in the future.
Future obligation refers to the sum of money to be paid in the following year and beyond under
such contracts, which extend for multiple years.

factors: there is no internationally unified definition of Defense expenditures (100 million dollars) Defense expenditures as % of GDP (%)
defense expenditures in the first place; even if defense 8,000 6.0

expenditures were publicly disclosed, their overall
amount or their breakdown is sometimes unclear; and
the budget system varies by country.
On such basis, if Japan’s defense-related expenditures
and those of other countries officially published by each
government were converted into dollar amounts, using
the purchasing power parity[5] of each country reported
by the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and
Development (OECD), the results would be as shown
in Fig. II-4-2-5 (The Defense Expenditures of Major
Countries [FY2021]). Compared to the other G7
countries, as well as Australia and the Republic of
Korea (ROK), Japan’s defense-related expenditures
as a percentage of GDP rank the lowest. Also, defense
expenditures per capita in Australia, the ROK, the
United Kingdom, France, and Germany are about two
to three times that of Japan.
Further, North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO)
member countries have agreed to spend a minimum of
2% of their GDP on defense by 2024, and according to
a NATO’s press release, eight countries including the
U.S. and the U.K. exceeded 2% in 2021 (estimated).
In addition, Fig. II-4-2-6 (Changes in Defense

Notes: 1. Defense expenditures are based on those officially published by each country and
are converted to US dollars, using each country's purchasing power parity for
FY2021 as published by the OECD (officially published rate as of April 2022).

(1 US dollar = 96.759441 yen = 4.18 yuan = 26.37 rubles = 808.46233 won =
1.464075 Australian dollars = 0.667865 pound = 0.713551 French euros =
0.731457 German euros)

2. The amounts of defense expenditures published by China appear to be only part of
its actual expenses for military purpose. According to analysis from the U.S.
Department of Defense, China’s actual defense expenditures for FY2021 are 1.1-2
times more than in its published defense budget.

3. The percentage of GDP is calculated based on defense expenditures officially
published by each country (in local currency) using the GDP of each country
published by the IMF (in local currency).

4. As defense expenditures published by NATO (which include pensions for retired
veterans, etc.) may differ from those officially published by each country, the
percentage of GDP based on defense expenditures published by NATO (in March
2022) does not necessarily coincide with the percentage of GDP calculated based
on defense expenditures officially published by each country.

5. Defense expenditures per capita are calculated using the populations published by

the UNFPA (State of the World Population 2021).

6. According to a SIPRI Fact Sheet (published in April 2022), global defense
expenditures represented 2.2% of global GDP in 2021, and Japan's defense
expenditures represented 1.1% of its GDP. Furthermore, according to the World
Bank, military expenditures of OECD members represented 2.5% of their total
amount of GDP in 2020.

**1**

The Act on the Peace and Independence of Japan and of occurrence of an Armed Attack Situation, etc., or


Maintenance of the Nation and the People’s Security
in Armed Attack Situations, etc., and a SurvivalThreatening Situation[1] is aimed at establishing a
system to respond to an Armed Attack Situation and
Anticipated Armed Attack Situation (Armed Attack
Situations, etc.[2]) and Survival-Threatening Situations,[3]
thereby contributing to the peace and independence of
Japan as well as the safety of the country and the people.
The Act specifies items that should be stipulated as
basic principles and basic policies (the Basic Response
Plan), as well as the responsibilities of national and
local governments, for responding to Armed Attack
Situations, etc., and Survival-Threatening Situations.

**1 Armed Attack Situations, etc. and**
**Survival-Threatening Situations**

Based on the Law for Peace and Independence of Japan
and Maintenance of the Nation and the People’s Security
in Armed Attack Situations etc. (Armed Attack Situation
Response Law), in situations such as an Armed Attack
Situation, etc. or a Survival-Threatening Situation, the
Government is required to adopt the Basic Response
Plan, which includes the following items, and ask for
approval by the Diet.
a. The Following Items concerning Situations that Need
to Be Dealt with:
(1) Sequence of events of the situation, the confirmation


of occurrence of an Armed Attack Situation, etc., or
a Survival-Threatening Situation, and the facts that
support this confirmation
(2) When the situation is confirmed as an Armed Attack
Situation, etc., or a Survival-Threatening Situation,
the reason why there are no other appropriate means
available to ensure Japan’s survival and protect its
people, and the use of force is necessary to respond
to the situation
b. An Overall Plan Related to the Response
c. Important Matters Related to the Response Measures

See Fig. II-5-1-1 (Procedures for Responding to Armed Attack

Situations, etc., and Survival-Threatening Situations)

**2 Responses of the SDF**

The Prime Minister can issue a Defense Operation
order to the whole or part of the SDF when it is deemed
necessary for the defense of Japan in Armed Attack
Situations and Survival-Threatening Situations. Prior
Diet approval is required for a Defense Operation order
in principle. The SDF under Defense Operation duty
is allowed to exercise the use of force only when the
“three conditions for ‘the use of force’” are satisfied.

**3 Civil Protection**

The Civil Protection Act[4] specifies responsibilities of
the national and local governments as well as measures


Official title: Act on the Peace and Independence of Japan and Maintenance of the Nation and the People’s Security in Armed Attack Situations, etc., and a Survival-Threatening Situation

“Armed Attack Situations” refers to situations in which an armed attack against Japan from outside occurs or in which it is considered that there is an imminent and clear danger of an armed
attack. “Expected Armed Attack Situations” refers to situations in which an armed attack is not yet made but the tension increased and an armed attack is expected. Both situations are collectively
called “Armed Attack Situations, etc.”

A “Survival-Threatening Situation” means a situation where an armed attack against a foreign country that is in a close relationship with Japan occurs, which in turn poses a clear risk of
threatening Japan’s survival and of overturning people’s rights to life, liberty and pursuit of happiness fundamentally.

**Responses to Situations that Will Have an Important Influence**
**2**

The Law Concerning Measures to Ensure the Peace and security, which the SDF may support, are “U.S.

and Security of Japan in Situations that Will Have an
Important Influence on Japan’s Peace and Security[7]
aims to strengthen cooperation with foreign countries
to respond to the situations that will have an important
influence on Japan’s peace and security (Situations
that Will Have an Important Influence[8]) by carrying
out measures such as logistics support activities and
thereby contributing to the peace and security of Japan.
The Law provides the coverage and response measures
as follows:

**1 Coverage**

The armed forces, etc., responding to situations that
will have an important influence on Japan’s peace


and security, which the SDF may support, are “U.S.
Armed Forces engaged in activities contributing to the
achievement of the objectives of the Japan-U.S. Security
Treaty,” “armed forces of other foreign countries
engaged in activities contributing to the achievement
of the objectives of the UN Charter” and “other similar
organizations.”

**2 Response Measures to Situations that**
**Will Have an Important Influence on**
**Japan’s Peace and Security**

Measures to respond to situations that will have an
important influence on Japan’s peace and security are:
(1) logistics support activities, (2) search and rescue
activities, (3) ship inspection operations,[9] and (4)
other measures necessary to respond to situations that
will have an important influence on Japan’s peace and
security.
It is possible to implement response measures in
foreign territories, but only when the foreign country
concerned consents.

**3 Measures to Avoid Integration with the**
**Use of Force**

The following measures are set forth in order to avoid
integration with the use of force by a foreign country
and also to ensure the safety of SDF personnel:

-  Japan does not implement support activities In
the scene where a combat is actually taking place.
Regarding search and rescue operations, however,
when stranded personnel have been located and
rescue operations have commenced, the SDF units
are allowed to continue search and rescue activities
as long as the safety of these units is ensured.

-  the commanding officers of the SDF units, etc.,
order a temporary suspension of support activities if
combat operations occur or are expected to occur at
the site of their activities or in the vicinity.

-  the Minister of Defense designates the area for

**(1) Public Security Operations by Order**
In the event of an indirect aggression or another
emergency situation, the Prime Minister can order
the whole or part of the SDF to deploy if it is deemed
impossible to maintain public security with the general
police force. In this instance, in principle, the Prime
Minister must bring the order to the Diet for deliberation,
and request for its approval within twenty days from the
day the order has been given.

**(2) Public Security Operations by Request**
Upon consulting with the Public Safety Commission of
the prefecture concerned, the governor of that prefecture
can request the Prime Minister to dispatch units, etc., of
the SDF if it is deemed unavoidable as the situation will
have a serious influence on public security. Following
such a request, the Prime Minister can order the SDF to
mobilize when a situation calls for such action.

**4 Destruction Measures against Ballistic**
**Missiles or Other Objects**

In cases where ballistic missiles or other objects are
flying to Japan as an armed attack or flying to Japan in
a Survival-Threatening Situation, and where the “Three
Conditions” are met, the SDF can respond with the
defense operation. In cases where ballistic missiles or
other objects are flying to Japan but which are not found
as an armed attack, the Minister of Defense can take the
following measures:
(1) If the Minister of Defense judges that ballistic
missiles or other objects are likely to fly to Japan
and that it is necessary to prevent damage to human
lives and property due to its fall in the territory of
Japan, the Minister, upon the approval of the Prime
Minister, can order the SDF units to take measures
to destroy the ballistic missiles or other objects
actually flying to the country in the airspace over
the territory of Japan or the high seas.
(2) In addition to the cases of (1) above, there may be
cases where the situation suddenly changes with little
information available on the launch, for example, and
the Minister of Defense cannot have time to obtain
approval from the Prime Minister. In preparation
for such cases, the Minister of Defense may create
an emergency response manual beforehand and
obtain approval from the Prime Minister. Following
the emergency response manual, the Minister of
Defense can order, for a specified period of time,
the SDF units to take measures to destroy ballistic
missiles or other objects in the airspace over the
territory of Japan or the high seas when such objects
are actually flying to the country.

See Fig. II-5-1-3 (Flow of Response to Ballistic Missiles or Other

Objects)

Article 76 of the SDF Law
(Issuance of Defense Operations Orders)


Concept of ensuring civilian control of the military

-  Response against ballistic missiles requires the government to assess the possibility of missiles flying toward Japan by comprehensively analyzing and evaluating
the specific situation and international circumstances. In addition to the SDF destroying the missile, interagency actions are required, for example, measures for civil
protection such as alert and evacuation, diplomatic activities, information gathering by related agencies, and enhancement of readiness for emergencies.

-  In view of the importance of the matter and the necessity of action by the Japanese government as a whole, the Cabinet and Minister of Defense can sufficiently
fulfill their responsibilities upon the Prime Minister’s approval (Cabinet decision) and orders by the Minister of Defense. Furthermore, the supervision of the Diet is
also defined with a provision in the law stipulating reporting to the Diet.

the means of transportation must be a government

implementation of the law. In addition, among foreign
nationals, (1) spouses and children of Japanese nationals,
(2) honorary consuls-general, honorary consuls, and
local personnel of overseas diplomatic missions, and (3)
so-called local personnel of independent administrative
institutions have become main subjects for transport
like Japanese nationals, and the main eligible people
have been thus expanded.
In addition, when their lives or bodies can be harmed,
upon a request from the Minister for Foreign Affairs and
after subsequent consultations between the Minister for
Foreign Affairs and the Minister of Defense, as well as
approval by the Prime Minister, the Minister of Defense
can order the SDF to conduct “rescue measures” that
include guarding and rescue of Japanese nationals, etc.
if all of the following requirements are satisfied.
a. It needs to be confirmed that in the areas where the
rescue measures are taken, the competent authorities
of the country concerned are maintaining public
safety and order, and no act of combat will be
conducted;
b. The host country[10] consents to the SDF taking the


**5 Measures against Intrusion of**
**Territorial Airspace**

The Minister of Defense may order SDF units to take
necessary measures to make intruding aircraft land or
withdraw from the territorial airspace of Japan (guiding
intruders away, issuing radio transmission warnings,
use of weapons, etc.) when a foreign aircraft intrudes
Japan’s territorial airspace in violation of international
law, the provisions of the Aviation Law or other relevant
laws and regulations.

**6 Rescue and Transportation of**
**Japanese Nationals Overseas**

If the Minister of Defense receives a request from the
Minister for Foreign Affairs upon an emergency situation
overseas, the Minister of Defense can order the SDF
to transport Japanese nationals and others who need
protection of lives or bodies to a safe place. In addition,
based on experiences such as the transport of Japanese
nationals from Afghanistan in August 2021, the law was
amended in 2022 (formulated and entered into force in

**(2) Activities that Contribute to the Defense of Japan**
“Activities that contribute to the defense of Japan”
include mainly the following ones, while the Government
of Japan is to examine each activity on a case-by-case
basis: (1) intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance
(ISR) activities including ballistic missile alert; (2)
transportation and replenishment activities in situations
that will have an important influence on Japan’s peace
and security; and (3) bilateral/multilateral exercises to
enhance capabilities required for defending Japan.

**(3) Judgment on Whether or Not to Conduct**
**Protection**

When the Minister of Defense receives a request from
the U.S. Forces, etc., the Minister subjectively should
judge whether the relevant activities are “activities
that contribute to the defense of Japan” and whether
protection is necessary, by considering the objective
and content of the activities, capability of the unit, and
surrounding circumstances as well as the impacts on
performance of the SDF’s regular operations.

**(4) Involvement of the Cabinet**
Requests from the U.S. Forces, etc. should be deliberated
in the NSC before the Minister of Defense judges on
conducting protection if the Minister receives requests
in the following cases. However, in urgent cases, the
Minister should promptly report to the NSC.
(1) The U.S. Forces, etc. makes a request for the first
time.
(2) The request is made for protection in the territory of
a third country.
(3) The request is recognized as particularly important,
although not falling under the above two categories.
In addition, in case protection under the situations
that will have an important influence is requested,
the Prime Minister should clearly state it in the Basic
Plan and should ask for a Cabinet decision on it after
deliberations in the NSC.

carry out the rescue measures as smoothly and safely
as possible in response to anticipated dangers.

**7 Protection of Weapons and Other**
**Equipment of the Units of the U.S. Forces and**

Based on Article 95-2 of the SDF Law, it has been
established that the SDF personnel may protect weapons
and other equipment of the units of the U.S. Forces and
the armed forces of other foreign countries actually
engaging in activities that contribute to the defense of
Japan in cooperation with the SDF. The basic principles
of the article, the Cabinet’s involvement in its operation,
etc. are provided by “The Implementation Guidelines
for Article 95-2 of the Self-Defense Forces Law”[11]
decided by the National Security Council. An outline of
the guidelines is as follows:

**(1) Purpose of Article 95-2**
Protection under this Article applies to weapons, etc. of
the units of the United States Forces, armed forces of
other foreign countries and other similar organizations
that are, in cooperation with the SDF, actually engaged
in activities that contribute to the defense of Japan
(including bilateral/multilateral exercises but excluding
activities in the scene where the combat activities are
actually being conducted). This Article is to enable SDF
personnel to carry out very passive and limited use of
weapons to the minimum extent necessary to protect
important material means which constitute the defense
capability of Japan from infringements which do not
amount to an armed attack.

**Disaster Relief Dispatches and Others**

**1 Disaster Relief Dispatches** **2 Earthquake Disaster Prevention**

In principle, Disaster Relief Dispatch is conducted as
follows: prefectural governors or other officials ask the
Minister of Defense, or an officer designated by the
Minister, to dispatch the SDF units, etc. in the event
of a natural disaster, and the Minister or the designated
officer dispatches the units, etc. if it is deemed necessary
for the SDF to respond to the disaster.[12] This procedure
is based on the idea that prefectural governors and
other officials should grasp the overall conditions of the
disaster and their own disaster relief capabilities first,
and then decide whether to make a request for the SDF
disaster relief dispatch.


**2 Earthquake Disaster Prevention**
**Dispatch and Nuclear Disaster Relief**
**Dispatch**

When a warning declaration is issued based on the Act
on Special Measures Concerning Countermeasures
for Large-Scale Earthquakes[13] or a declaration of a
nuclear emergency situation is issued based on the Act
on Special Measures Concerning Nuclear Emergency
Preparedness, the Minister of Defense is authorized to
order dispatching units upon a request of the Director
of the Seismic Disaster Warning Headquarters or the
Director of the Nuclear Disaster Countermeasures
Headquarters (the Prime Minister).

**(2) Response Measures**
The following response measures can be implemented
in situations threatening the international peace and
security that the international community is collectively
addressing.
a. Cooperation and Support Activities
Supplies and services to armed forces of foreign countries
(supply, transportation, repair and maintenance, medical
services, communications, airport and seaport services,
base services, lodging, storage, use of facilities, training
services and construction) are to be provided.
While the provision of weapons is not included, as
in the Law Concerning Measures to Ensure the Peace
and Security of Japan in Situations that Will Have an
Important Influence on Japan’s Peace and Security,
the “provision of ammunition” and “refueling and
maintenance of aircraft ready to take off for combat
operations” are allowed.
b. Search and Rescue Activities
c. Ship Inspection Operations[16] (Those Set Forth in the
Ship Inspection Operations Law)

**(3) Measures to Avoid Integration with the Use of**
**Force**

The following measures are set forth in order to avoid
integration with the use of force by a foreign country
and also to ensure the safety of SDF personnel:

-  The SDF units do not implement support activities
in the scene where a combat is actually taking place.
However, when the people stranded have already
been found and rescue operations have commenced,
the SDF units are allowed to continue search and
rescue activities concerning them as long as the
safety of these units is ensured.

-  The commanding officers of the SDF units, etc.,
order a temporary suspension of support activities if
combat operations occur or are expected to occur at
the site of their activities or in the vicinity.



-  The Minister of Defense designates the area for
implementing activities, and if it is deemed difficult
to implement operations smoothly and safely in
the whole or part of that area, the Minister must
promptly change the designation of the area or order
the cessation of the activities being implemented
there.

**2 International Peace Cooperation**
**Assignments**

The International Peace Cooperation Act[17] is aimed at
enabling active contribution by Japan to international
peace efforts centering upon the United Nations. It
is to set forth a framework for the Implementation of
International Peace Cooperation Assignments, with a
view to extending appropriate and prompt cooperation
for efforts such as United Nations Peacekeeping
Operations[18] and Internationally Coordinated Operations
for Peace and Security,[19] and to take measures to extend
contributions in kind for those operations.

**(1) Requirements for Participation**
a. UN PKO
The so-called Five Principles for Participation in UN
PKO[20] constitute Japan’s basic policy for participation
in UN PKOs. On that basis, the International Peace
Cooperation Act stipulates that the consent for
acceptance of countries to which the areas where these
operations are conducted belong needs to be recognized
as being stably maintained throughout the period of the
operations if the SDF conducts so-called safety-ensuring
operations or so-called kaketsuke-keigo operations.
b. Internationally Coordinated Operations for Peace
and Security
Japan is able to participate in Internationally Cooperated
Operations for Peace and Security whose nature or
details are similar to those of UN PKO, when any of

clearly an inherent part of the territory of Japan, both historically
and under international law. Japan actually has effective control
of the islands. Therefore, there is no territorial issue to be resolved
in the first place.
After a careful examination that there are no signs of any
other country’s control in 1895, the Japanese government
decided to put the Senkaku Islands under the jurisdiction of
Okinawa Prefecture by legitimate means under international
law at a Cabinet meeting and officially incorporated the islands
into the territory of Japan. China began to make its own claims
regarding the Senkaku Islands in the 1970s, after a UN agency
pointed out possible oil reserves in the East China Sea in 1968.
It had not raised any objections until this point.
However, since Chinese maritime patrol vessels intruded into
Japanese territorial waters surrounding the Senkaku Islands for
the first time in 2008, they have repeatedly intruded into our
territorial waters despite our strong objections, which is utterly
unacceptable. The activities of Chinese maritime patrol vessels,

are taking steps to ensure the safety of navigation in the
region by utilizing ships and aircraft.
In order to ease tensions and stabilize the situation
in the Middle East, the Japanese Government has
actively promoted diplomatic initiatives, including then
Prime Minister Abe’s visit to Iran in the same month,
and the Japan-U.S. summit meeting during the UN
General Assembly and the Japan-Iran summit meeting
in September.
In this context, as a result of discussions that took
place between the Prime Minister and other relevant
ministers at the National Security Council and other
meetings, Japan’s own initiative to ensure peace and
stability in the Middle East and the safety of Japanrelated vessels is as follows: (1) further diplomatic
efforts to ease tensions in the Middle East and
stabilize the situation; (2) thorough implementation of
navigation safety measures, including close information
sharing with relevant industries; and (3) conducting
of information gathering activities via the use of SDF
assets. In December, the Cabinet approved them as the
government’s policy for governmental efforts to ensure
the safety of Japan-related vessels.
Since the Cabinet decision in December 2021 these


information gathering activities have been utilizing two
P-3C patrol aircraft of the Deployment Air Force for
Counter Piracy Enforcement (DAPE), as well as one
destroyer of the Deployment Surface Force for Counter
Piracy Enforcement (DSPE).
The area of operation includes three waters of high
seas: the Gulf of Oman, the northern Arabian Sea and
the Gulf of Aden to the east of the Bab el-Mandeb Strait
(including the exclusive economic zones of the coastal
states).
Information gathered by the SDF is shared with the
Cabinet Secretariat, the Ministry of Land, Infrastructure,
Transport and Tourism (MLIT), MOFA, and other
relevant ministries and agencies, as well as with relevant
industries through public-private liaison meetings, to be
used for the government’s navigation safety measures.

**2 Activities by the SDF**

**(1) Information gathering activities by the SDF**
The SDF’s information gathering activities are aimed
at collecting information necessary to ensure the safety
of Japan-related vessels as a part of the government’s
navigation safety measures

-  In addition to Japanese vessels and foreign vessels with Japanese nationals onboard, it also refers to vessels that are important to the stable economic activities of Japanese
citizens, including foreign vessels operated by a Japanese ship operator, and foreign vessels transporting Japanese cargo.


The activities are to be conducted in accordance with
the provisions of Article 4, paragraph (1), item (xviii)
of the Act for Establishment of the Ministry of Defense,
as these activities are necessary in making decision to
order Maritime Security Operations (provided in Article
82 of the Self-Defense Forces Law) and conducting
the operation smoothly when ordered, as measures
for unforeseen circumstances or other changes in the
situation.

**(2) Results of the SDF’s Activities**
In January 2020, two P-3C patrol aircraft of the counterpiracy unit began information gathering activities.
In addition, in February 2020, a destroyer of the
Deployment Surface Force for Information Gathering
Activities began information gathering activities.
Based on the December 2021 Cabinet decision,
since February 2022 the Deployment Surface Force


for Counter Piracy Enforcement (DSPE) has been
conducting both counter-piracy operations and
information gathering activities.
To date, no information has been received that there
were unusual events for Japan-related vessels in the sea

**(3) Extension of the Activity Period**
In the Middle East, although there is no immediate need
to protect Japan-related vessels, high tensions persist,
and, based on the fact that each country is continuing
its own activities, including the “International Maritime
Security Construct” by the United States and other
countries, the Japanese Government has been extending
the SDF’s activity period by about one year every year
since 2020.
If it is deemed before the expiration of the period
that activities by the SDF are no longer necessary in
light of the need to ensure the safety of navigation for
Japan-related vessels, the Government will conclude
these activities at that point and without waiting for
the end of the activity period. In addition, the National
Security Council will consider how to respond if there
is a significant change in the situation.

See Fig. III-1-1-5 (Units Engaged in Information Gathering

See

Activities in the Middle East), Fig. III-1-1-6 (Information
Gathering Activities by the SDF [image]), Reference 20
(Government’s Efforts to Ensure the Safety of Japan-Related
Vessels in the Middle East)

**3 Communication and Cooperation with**
**Relevant Countries**

**(1) United States**
As a result of a comprehensive review of what measures
Japan should take to ensure the safe navigation of


Japan-related vessels in the Middle East, Japan has
started to implement efforts as Japan’s independent
initiative without participating in the International
Maritime Security Construct led by the United States,
considering the need for ensuring a stable supply of
crude oil, relations with the United States, and relations
with Iran. At the same time, to ensure safe navigation
in the Middle East, the SDF has been cooperating
closely with the United States in various ways. In the
information gathering activities as well, the SDF is
to appropriately cooperate with the United States as
an ally, while observing the government’s policy of
conducting navigation safety measures independently
from any other country’s initiatives. For this reason, an
MSDF officer has been dispatched to the U.S. Central
Naval Command in Bahrain as a liaison officer to share
information with the U.S. Forces.

**(2) Coastal States in the Middle East**
It is important to gain understanding of the coastal states,
including Iran, regarding the information gathering
activities that Japan is undertaking as an independent
initiative, and Japan has been explaining these activities
to them with transparency. In addition, the coastal states
play an important role in ensuring safe navigation in the
Middle East. Japan has been reaching out to the coastal
states to gain their understanding of Japan’s efforts.

Further cooperation with the U.S. Government
including the U.S. Forces in Japan is essential for
efficient and effective operation of the BMD system.
Thus, related measures including constant real-time
sharing of BMD operational and relevant information,
and the expansion of BMD cooperation have been
agreed upon at the Japan-U.S. Security Consultative
Committee (“2+2” Meeting).
Furthermore, Japan has closely cooperated with the
United States in responding to ballistic missiles, by
means such as receiving Shared Early Warning (SEW)[6]
from the U.S. Forces, and sharing intelligence gathered
by assets including transportable BMD radar (TPY-2
radar) and Aegis-equipped destroyers deployed in Japan

**(3) Initiatives towards Strengthening of the BMD**
**System**

Currently the SDF maneuvers and deploys, according to
situation, Aegis-equipped destroyers for defense of the
entire territory of Japan and PAC-3, which is deployed
across the country for the defense of stationing locations.
Based on these actions, the MOD/SDF has been
increasing Aegis destroyers with BMD capabilities.


The number of Aegis destroyers with BMD
capabilities increased from the existing six to eight in
FY2020.
Meanwhile, Japan and the United States are jointly
developing advanced interceptor missiles for BMD
(SM-3 Block IIA), which will be the successor to SM-3
Block IA to be mounted on Aegis-equipped destroyers,
and promoting the project to its deployment, in order to
deal with future threats posed by increasingly advanced
and diverse ballistic missile attacks. At the National

Security Council 9-Minister Meeting in December 2016,
a decision was made to transition to joint production
and the deployment phase. Since the FY2017 budget,
SM-3 Block IIA acquisitions are ongoing.
In comparison with the previous SM-3 Block IA
missiles, these SM-3 Block IIA missiles have not
only extended interceptable altitude and coverage of
protection, but also have enhanced defeating capability
and simultaneous engagement capability.
In addition, the interception capabilities of SM-3
Block IIA have been enhanced against ballistic missiles
equipped with interception avoidance measures such as
a decoy and ballistic missiles launched with an intention
to avoid being intercepted by taking a higher than
nominal trajectory (lofted trajectory).[7]

Furthermore, the Cabinet approved the development
of two Aegis system-equipped vessels instead of the
land-based Aegis system (Aegis Ashore) in December
2020, as part of measures to be taken to respond more
flexibly and effectively to the increasingly severe
security environment surrounding Japan. The ships will
be maintained by the MSDF, and their details, including
functions to be added to the ships and design plans, will
continue to be examined and necessary measures will
be taken.
With regard to Patriot PAC-3, the MOD has been
working for procurement of the enhanced capability
type, PAC-3 MSE (Missile Segment Enhancement)
and started its deployment at the end of FY2019.
Introduction of PAC-3 MSE will realize the extension
of interception altitude from less than 20 km to tens of
km, meaning that the coverage of protection (area) will
expand more than twice compared to the conventional
PAC-3.
Furthermore, the MOD/SDF decided to prepare
effectively for the new kind of aerial threats including
hypersonic weapons.
At the Japan-U.S. “2+2” Meeting in January 2022,


the two countries agreed to conduct a joint analysis
focused on future cooperation in counter-hypersonic
technology.
In this way Japan is taking measures necessary to
strengthen its protection structure and will continue
these efforts.

See Fig. III-1-2-5 (Major Efforts to Improve Ballistic Missile

Response Capabilities)

**2 Missile Defense of the United States**
**and Japan-U.S. BMD Technical**
**Cooperation**

**(1) Missile Defense of the United States**
The United States is developing a multi-tier missile
defense system that combines defense systems suited
for each of the following phases of the ballistic missile
flight path to provide a mutually complementary
response: (1) the boost phase, (2) the mid-course phase,
and (3) the terminal phase. Japan and the United States
have developed close coordination concerning ballistic
missile defense, and a part of the missile defense system
of the United States has been deployed in our country in
a step-by-step manner.[8]

**(2) Japan-U.S. BMD Technology Cooperation, etc.**
The government commenced a Japan-U.S.
cooperative research project on a sea-based upper-tier
system in FY1999. As the result showed good prospects
for resolving initial technical challenges, in December
2005, the then Security Council and the Cabinet
decided to start Japan-U.S. cooperative development
of an advanced ballistic missile interceptor by using
the results of the project as a technical basis.[9] The
joint development started in June 2006 with a view
to expanding the coverage of protection and dealing
with future threats posed by increasingly advanced and
diverse ballistic missile attacks.


By taking a higher trajectory than minimum energy trajectories (trajectories that enable efficient flying of a missile and maximize its range), it takes a shorter range than the maximum range, but
the falling speed of the missile becomes faster.

Specifically, a TPY-2 radar (so-called X-band radar) for BMD has been deployed at the U.S. Shariki Communication Site in 2006. In October 2006, Patriot PAC-3 units were deployed in
Okinawa Prefecture, and in October 2007, a Joint Tactical Ground Station (JTAGS) was deployed in Aomori Prefecture. Furthermore, the 2nd TPY-2 radar was deployed at the U.S. Kyogamisaki
Communication Site in December 2014. In October 2018, the 38th Air Defense Artillery Brigade Headquarters was deployed in Sagamihara. In addition, BMD-capable Aegis ships of the U.S.
Forces were deployed at Commander Fleet Activities, Yokosuka (Yokosuka City, Kanagawa Prefecture) in October 2015, March 2016 and May 2018.

With regard to the Japan-U.S. cooperative development, it is necessary to export BMD related arms from Japan to the United States. In accordance with the Chief Cabinet Secretary’s statement
issued in December 2004, it was determined that the Three Principles on Arms Exports would not apply to the BMD system and related matters under the condition that strict controls are
maintained. Based on these circumstances, it was decided that the prior consent of Japan could be given to the third party transfer of the SM-3 Block IIA under certain conditions. This decision was
formally announced in the Joint Statement of the Japan-U.S. Security Consultative Committee (2+2 Meeting) in June 2011. The Three Principles on Transfer of Defense Equipment and Technology
(Three Principles) received Cabinet approval in April 2014. However, with regard to exceptional measures instigated before this decision, overseas transfers will continue to be organized in the

**2 Responses to Attacks by Guerillas and**
**Special Operations Forces**

Typical forms of attacks by guerrillas or special forces
include the destruction of critical private infrastructure
and other facilities, attacks against people, and
assassinations of dignitaries.
In dealing with attacks by guerrillas or special forces,
the MOD/SDF will respond with a particular emphasis
on the establishment of a relevant information gathering
posture, monitoring and surveillance to prevent
invasions in coastal areas, protection of key facilities,
and search and destruction of invading guerrillas or
special forces. Efforts will be made for early detection
of attacks and indications through monitoring and
surveillance, and, as required, the SDF units will be
deployed to protect key facilities, such as nuclear power
plants, and the necessary posture for protection will be
established at an early stage. Based on this, in the event
of an infiltration of our territory by guerrillas or special
operations forces, they will be searched for and detected
by reconnaissance units, aviation units and others, and
combat units will be promptly deployed to besiege and
capture or to destroy them.

See Fig. III-1-2-6 (Example of Operations against the Attacks by

See

Guerillas and Special Forces)

**3 Response to Armed Agents**

**(1) Basic Concept**
While the police assume primary responsibility for
responding to illegal activities of armed agents, the
SDF will respond in accordance with situational
developments. When this happens, the SDF cooperates
with the police force. Accordingly, with regard to public
security operations of the SDF, the Basic Agreement[11]
concerning cooperation procedures between the SDF
and the police, as well as local agreements between
GSDF divisions/brigades and prefectural police forces,
have been concluded.[12]

**(2) Initiatives of the MOD/SDF**
GSDF has been conducting field training nationwide
with the prefectural police, in an effort to strengthen


GSDF personnel engaging in a ground combat training

such collaboration by conducting field exercises at
nuclear power plants throughout the country since 2012.
Furthermore, joint exercises in dealing with suspicious
vessels have also been conducted regularly between the
MSDF and the Japan Coast Guard.

**4 Response to Nuclear, Biological, and**
**Chemical Weapons**

In recent years, there has been strong recognition of the
danger of NBC (Nuclear, Biological, and Chemical)
weapon proliferation, which can cause indiscriminate
mass casualties and contamination of an extensive area,
and the means for transporting such weapons, as well
as related equipment and materials, to terrorists and
countries under suspicion of proliferating such weapons.
The sarin gas attack on the Tokyo subway in March
1995 is one of the examples of an incident in which
these weapons were used.

**(1) Basic Concept**
In the event of the use of NBC weapons in Japan in a
way that corresponds to an armed attack, the SDF will
conduct defense operations to repel the armed attack and
rescue victims. Furthermore, in the event of the use of
NBC weapons in a way that does not correspond to an
armed attack but against which the general police alone
cannot maintain public security, the SDF will conduct
public security operations to suppress the armed group
and rescue victims in cooperation with related agencies.
Furthermore, when the incident does not fall under


11 The Agreement on the Maintenance of Public Order in the Event of Public Security Operations, which was concluded between the then Defense Agency and the National Public Safety Commission
(concluded in 1954 and fully revised in 2000).

12 In 2004, guidelines were jointly formulated between the National Police Agency and the Defense Agency concerning dealing jointly with public security operations in the event of armed agent

In order to invade the islands of Japan, invading
countries are expected to gain sea and air superiority,
followed by the landing of ground troops from the sea
and airborne troops from the air.
For invading ground and airborne troops, it tends to
be difficult to exert systematic combat capabilities while
they are moving on their vessels or aircraft or right
before or after they land in our territory. As we protect
our land, we need to make best use of this weakness to
deal with our enemies between coastal and sea areas or
at landing points as much as possible and attack them at
an early stage.

Japan depends upon other countries for the supply
of much of its resources and food, making maritime
transportation routes the lifeblood for securing the

if our country comes under armed attack, etc., maritime
transportation routes will be the foundation to maintain
continuous warfare capabilities and enable the U.S.
Forces to come and assist in the defense of Japan.
In operations to ensure the safety of our maritime
transportation, the SDF will combine various operations
such as anti-sea, anti-submarine, anti-air and anti-mine
operations to patrol,[14] defend SDF ships, and protect
straits and ports, as well as setting up sea lanes[15] to

**(2) Improving Various Capabilities to Leverage**
**Space Domain Including Information-Gathering,**
**Communication and Positioning Capabilities**

While the MOD/SDF has conducted informationgathering, communication and positioning using
satellites, from the perspective of strengthening
Command, Control, Communication, Computer,
Intelligence, Surveillance, Reconnaissance (C4ISR)
functions, the MOD/SDF will ensure redundancy by
receiving signals from multiple positioning satellites,
including from the Quasi Zenith Satellite System
(QZSS)[1], and by using commercial satellites, etc.
The MOD/SDF will strengthen its intelligence
and surveillance capabilities through acquisition
of multilayered satellite images such as by using
Information Gathering Satellites (IGS) with the aim of
a 10 satellite system, and by using commercial satellites
such as small satellite constellations that enable frequent
imaging.
It will also continue to use images from the satellite
operated by JAXA (ALOS-2) and information from
Automatic Identification System (AIS), etc., and will
mount a sensor on JAXA’s Advanced Land Observing
Satellite-3 (ALOS-3) to conduct research on dual band
infrared sensors.[2]

Regarding communications, the MOD/SDF launched


X-band defense communications satellites called
Kirameki-2 in January 2017 and Kirameki-1 in April
2018, owned and operated by the MOD for the first
time, to be used for the communications, which is
essential for command and control in unit operations.
Going forward, in order to respond to the increase in
communication requirements and to further strengthen
resiliency, the MOD is aiming for a system of three
X-band defense communications satellites by launching
Kirameki-3 and will be conducting research and study
on next defense communications in FY2022.
With regard to positioning, the MOD/SDF mounts
GPS receiving terminals on a large number of equipment
and uses them as important means to support troop
movement, including highly accurate self-positioning
and improvement of missile guidance. In addition to
these efforts, the QZSS of the Cabinet Office started
service in November 2018. With this in mind, the
MOD/SDF will secure redundancy by using multiple
positioning satellite signals, including QZSS.

**(3) Enhancing Capabilities to Ensure Superiority in**
**Use of Space**

While utilization of satellites plays a vital role as the
basic infrastructure for security, some countries appear
to be developing anti-satellite weapons, including
killer satellites, anti-satellite missiles, and jamming
weapons that interfere with electromagnetic waves.
In this context, it is also important for the MOD/SDF
to strengthen satellite resilience. Part of that effort
is introducing system for detecting jamming against
Japan’s satellites.
The SDF will build the capability to disrupt C4I of
opponents in coordination with the electromagnetic
spectrum domain capabilities.
Furthermore, small satellite constellations are
attracting attention as a technological trend related to
missile detection, early warning, and tracking functions.
The U.S. is moving forward with National Defense
Space Architecture, a plan to launch hundreds or more
of inexpensive small satellites for communications,
positioning, reconnaissance, SSA, and missile tracking,
and is currently preparing to launch a technology


This refers to satellites set into orbit so that the satellites are capable of staying nearly right above one specific area by tilting the orbit and adopting and elliptical orbit, while ordinary stationary
satellites stay in orbit on the equator. Multiple satellites are usually launched since a single satellite cannot stay online for 24 hours by itself. Users are able to receive signals from such satellites
without being affected by obstacles, such as mountains and buildings, since the satellites pass nearly right above the users.

Research is underway to mount dual wavelength infrared sensors with excellent detection and identification performance on the Advanced Optical Satellite planned at JAXA and activate them in

Strategy was formulated for the comprehensive
and effective promotion of measures pertaining to
cybersecurity, with the aims to create and develop a free,
fair and secure cyberspace and subsequently contribute
to improving socio-economic vitality and sustainable
development, building a society where people can live
safe and secure lives, and ensuring peace and stability of
the international community and national security.
This strategy is intended to outline the goals and
implementation policies for various cybersecurity
measures to be taken over the next three years, and it
was reviewed in July 2018 and September 2021. The
current strategy, which is the third version, maintains
the basic position presented in the previous two
versions, while promoting measures based on three
directions ((1) advancing digital transformation and


cybersecurity simultaneously; (2) ensuring the overall
safety and security of cyberspace as it becomes public,
interconnected and interrelated; and (3) enhancing
initiatives from the perspective of national security) to
ensure “a free, fair and secure cyberspace.”

**2 Initiatives of the MOD/SDF**

Information and communications networks that leverage
cyberspace are a foundation for the SDF’s activities
in various domains, and attack against them seriously
disrupts the organized activities of the SDF.
The MOD/SDF are taking comprehensive measures
such as (1) ensuring safety of information systems,
(2) dealing with cyber attacks[5] by specialized units,
(3) maintenance and development of a response

posture to cyber attacks, (4) research of cutting edge
technologies, (5) development of human resources, and
(6) coordination with other organizations and agencies,
etc.
In this context based on the NDPG, the SDF will
fundamentally strengthen its cyber defense capability,
including the capability to disrupt the use of cyberspace
by the opponents in the event of an attack against
Japan in a contingency. Specifically, the MTDP
stipulates (1) establishing the necessary environment
for ensuring cybersecurity, (2) keeping abreast of the
latest information including cyber-related risks, counter
measures and technological trends, (3) developing and
securing human resources, and also (4) contributing to
whole-of-government initiatives.

See Fig. III-1-3-3 (MOD/SDF Comprehensive Measures to Deal

See

with Cyber Attacks)
Reference 16 (Efforts in Recent Years by the MOD on
Cybersecurity)

**(1) Establishing an Environment for Ensuring**
**Cybersecurity**

a. Establishment of the JSDF Cyber Defense Command
The NDPG and MTDP states the establishment of a
“Cyber Defense Unit” as a joint unit so as to drastically
strengthen cyber defense capabilities. Based on this,
in FY2021, the JSDF Cyber Defense Command was
newly established to deal with cyber attacks, as well as
to conduct capacity building for the SDF’s cyber-related
units, and maintain and operate the Defense Information
Infrastructure (DII),[6] a common network for the MOD/
SDF.
b. Strengthening Capabilities of Information Gathering,
Research and Analysis
In order to secure the functions of the system and
networks of the MOD/SDF under any circumstance,
it is necessary to strengthen the information gathering,
research and analysis, and practical training functions
that support this capability.
To this end, the MOD/SDF will continue initiatives
such as (1) reinforcement of information gathering
devices for indications and techniques of cyber attacks,
(2) enhancement of response capabilities against cyber
attacks utilizing AI and other advanced technologies, and
(3) development of an environment for cyber exercises
carried out as competition between an attacking team


and a defending team.
In addition, the MOD/SDF collects and analyzes
cyberspace threats intelligence, such as by collecting
information and exchanging information with other
countries.

**(2) Keeping Abreast of the Latest Information**
**Including Risks, Countermeasures and**
**Technological Trends**

In order to respond to cyber attacks in a swift and
appropriate manner, it is necessary to keep abreast of the
latest information, including cyber-related risks, counter
measures and technological trends, through cooperation
with the private sector, and strategic talks, bilateral/
multilateral exercises and other opportunities with
allies and other parties. For this purpose, the MOD/SDF
will effectively cooperate with private companies and
foreign countries, including the United States, which is
Japan’s ally.
a. Cooperation with Private Companies and Others
In Japan, in July 2013, the Cyber Defense Council
(CDC) was set up with its member consisting of around
ten companies in the defense industry with a strong
interest in cybersecurity. With the MOD serving as
the hub for information sharing among companies in
the defense industry, efforts will be made to aggregate
the information and to grasp the overall picture of
cyber attacks. In addition, a joint training takes place
annually, simulating a situation where the MOD/SDF,
and defense industry are under cyber attacks as part of
efforts to improve both of their response to cyber attack
capabilities.
b. Cooperation with the United States
Since it is vital to have comprehensive defense
cooperation, including joint response, between Japan
and its ally the United States, the Japanese and U.S.
governments, as their main framework for cyber
cooperation, first set up the Cyber Defense Policy
Working Group (CDPWG) as a framework between
the defense authorities of Japan and the United States.
Under this framework, meetings have been held seven
times to discuss the following topics: (1) promotion of
policy discussions regarding cyber issues, (2) closer
sharing of information, (3) promotion of bilateral/
multilateral exercises incorporating response to cyber

attacks, and (4) matters such as cooperation for training
and retaining experts.
In addition, Japan’s cooperation with the United
States is to be further strengthened by such means as
participation in “the Japan-U.S. Cyber Dialogue,” a
whole-of-government framework by both nations, and
holding “the Japan-U.S. IT Forum.”
c. Cooperation with Other Countries etc.
The MOD has held the “Japan-NATO Cyber Defense
Staff Talks” with the North Atlantic Treaty Organization
(NATO) to exchange opinions on various issues related
to cyberspace between defense authorities, and has
continued to participate in cyber defense exercises
organized by the NATO and the NATO Cooperative
Cyber Defence Centre of Excellence (CCDCOE) to
enhance cooperation and collaboration with the NATO.
In addition, Japan has held cyber dialogues with
Australia, the United Kingdom, Germany, France, and
Estonia.
Furthermore, the IT Forum has been held with
the defense authorities of Singapore, Vietnam, and
other countries to exchange views on initiatives
in the information communications area including
cybersecurity and current trends in technology.
In March 2022, the GSDF organized the Multilateral
Cyber Security Competition to strengthen capabilities in
the cyber domain together with participating countries,
which included Australia, France, and the U.S.

**(3) Development and Securing of Human Resources**

In order to strengthen the SDF’s cyber defense
capability, securing human resources who possess
advanced and broad-ranging knowledge on cybersecurity
is an urgent issue. Proactive efforts, including the
expansion of education and the utilization of civilian
knowledge, are necessary.
In this context, personnel are continuously and
by stages assigned to cyber-related departments, and
provided with both internal and external education in
order to acquire and maintain advanced knowledge and
skills.
Common cyber training to acquire common and
sophisticated knowledge on cybersecurity has been
provided since FY2019 as a common educational course
for all SDF services, and the SDF continues to dispatch


personnel to courses for cyber warfare commanders at
the National War College in the U.S. In addition, from
FY2021, a new System/Cyber Specialized Course has
been established at the GSDF High Technical School,
and personnel are being dispatched to a new cyber
warfare planners course offered by the U.S. Army’s
cyber education institute.
Moreover, since July 2021, the MOD/SDF has been
hiring people with advanced knowledge/skills and
extensive experience/achievements in the cyber domain
as Chief Cybersecurity Advisors.
The MOD/SDF also work to ensure appropriate
treatment for security and IT personnel who work as a
bridge between highly skilled professional workers and
general administration departments in the MOD and
consider the utilization of external human resources
such as public-private personnel exchange system to
employ people with practical experience in private
companies and service contracts.
Furthermore, since cybersecurity depends on the
cyber literacy of personnel who use networks and
systems, not just specialized personnel with advanced
knowledge, the MOD/SDF is promoting cyber literacy
education, including information assurance training, for
self defence officials and administrative officers.

**(4) Contribution to the Whole-of-Government**
**Initiatives**

Along with the National Police Agency, the
Digital Agency, the Ministry of Internal Affairs and
Communications, the Ministry of Economy, Trade and
Industry, and the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, the MOD,
as one of the government agencies that are members of
Cybersecurity Strategy Headquarters, participates in
cyber attack response training and personnel exchanges,
and provides information about cyber attacks, etc.
to the cross-sector initiatives led by the NISC as well
as sending personnel to the Cyber Incident Mobile
Assistant Team (CYMAT).[7] The MOD is considering
applying the knowledge and experience of the SDF
to penetration tests of the IT systems of government
ministries and agencies conducted by the NISC.

develop an information sharing posture, (3) strengthen
capabilities to neutralize the radar and communications
of opponents who intend to invade Japan, (4) strengthen
capabilities to minimize the effects of interference
in the electromagnetic domain, and thereby acquire
and enhance capabilities to ensure superiority in the
electromagnetic domain.

**1 Enhancing the Ability to Appropriately**
**Manage and Coordinate the Use of**
**Electromagnetic Spectrum**

In order to gain an advantage in warfare by using
electromagnetic spectrum proactively and effectively,
it is necessary to establish an electromagnetic spectrum
management posture that centrally grasps and
coordinates wave frequencies and status of use, and
appropriately allocates frequency resources to units, etc,
as well as to improve electronic warfare capabilities.
For this purpose, the electromagnetic spectrum
management function is being strengthened, such
as through research on electromagnetic spectrum
management support technologies to understand
the status of the electromagnetic spectrum used by
equipment communication devices, radar, and electronic
warfare devices etc and visualize them on monitors


**2 Strengthening Information Collection**
**and Analysis Capabilities Related to**
**Electromagnetic Spectrum, and Building**
**an Information Sharing Posture**

In order to gain an advantage in electromagnetic warfare,
it is important to gather and analyze information on
electromagnetic spectrum at all phases from peacetime
to armed contingencies and appropriately share the
information among the SDF units.
To this end, in FY2022, the MOD/SDF will increase
the number of personnel of the electronic warfare
operations units, which were newly formed in FY2021
under the Ground Component Command, deploy the
GSDF’s Network Electronic Warfare System (NEWS) at
Camp Yonago and other locations, and begin necessary
enhancements to reinforce the command and control
of electronic warfare operation units deployed across
Japan. In addition to acquiring the airframe components
for ASDF RC-2 aircraft, and prior to developing
the successor to the MSDF’s multipurpose EP-3
aircraft, the MOD/SDF will research on information
collection systems that utilize the latest technologies
such as AI and continue to conduct research on the
technical requirements and support systems, etc.,
necessary to incorporate AI thereby strengthening

information collection and analysis capabilities in the
electromagnetic spectrum domain. The MOD/SDF will
also continue to promote the connection of each SDF
service’s systems, including the Defense Information
Infrastructure (DII) and the improvement of data links.

**3** **Strengthening Capabilities to Neutralize**
**Radar and Communications of an**
**Opponent who Intends to Invade Japan**

Neutralizing use of electromagnetic spectrum, including
radar and communications of an opponent who intends
to invade Japan based on information gathering and
analysis in peacetime is effective as a means for the
defense of Japan so that even when inferiority exists in
individual domains such inferiority will be overcome
and national defense accomplished.
To this end, under the FY2022 budget, the MOD/
SDF will acquire NEWS, which supports the exercise
of firepower by neutralizing an opponent’s use of the
electromagnetic spectrum to provide an advantage in
various battles such as land battles, and promote the
deployment of electronic warfare units equipped with
NEWS. The MOD/SDF will also develop ASDF standoff
electronic warfare aircraft that implement effective
electromagnetic spectrum interference according to
the interference target from outside an opponent’s
threat (standoff range) to support carrying out SDF air
operations; and research ship-based electromagnetic
spectrum detection and interference devices that can
detect and identify the electromagnetic spectrum used
by the radar and communications equipment on aircraft/


missiles and then disable them.
Furthermore, for effective response against the threat of
swarm attacks that use a large number of drones, a budget
has continually been included for the demonstration
of high-power microwave irradiation technology and
research on high-energy laser systems, etc.

**4 Strengthening Capabilities to Minimize**
**the Effects of Interference in the**
**Electromagnetic Spectrum Domain**

In order to minimize the effects of interference in the
electromagnetic spectrum domain, thereby ensuring air
superiority, the MOD/SDF is promoting the acquisition
of F-35As with superior electronic protection capability.
In addition, to improve flexibility in fighter operations,
the MOD/SDF will acquire F-35Bs for their superior
electronic protection capability and short takeoff and
vertical landing capabilities.

**5 Training/Exercise and Human**
**Resource Development**

To strengthen the SDF’s capabilities in the
electromagnetic spectrum domain and to develop
personnel with specialized knowledge, in addition
to conducting integrated electromagnetic spectrum
operations training, the MOD/SDF is collecting the
latest knowledge and expertise in the electromagnetic
spectrum domain by dispatching personnel to participate
in educational programs on electronic warfare held in
the U.S.[9]


In addition, the MOD/SDF is advancing the multiplication of the communications network required for information sharing among the SDF services across Japan, and conducting research on EMP
protection

(November 2018), in order to rescue and support
more victims in the event of a large-scale disaster and
considering possible confusion of the local governments,
the MOD/SDF will not only wait for requests from the
local governments but also actively propose specific
support activities by the SDF. In actual activities,
the SDF will provide flexible support by accurately
understanding needs, which change depending on the
situation. For this purpose, the SDF is strengthening
dissemination of information so that people who
truly need support by the SDF can easily access the
information related to support.
Furthermore, the SDF has an initial response posture
in place to ensure that disaster relief operations are
conducted promptly.
For example, when an earthquake of seismic intensity
of upper five or higher occurs, information is collected
by aircraft.

**(1) Response to Natural Disasters, etc.**
a. Disaster Relief to Atami City, Shizuoka Prefecture, in
Response to Heavy Rain from July 1, 2021
On the morning of July 3, 2021, a debris flow was
triggered in a residential area of Atami City Shizuoka


Prefecture, by heavy rains that had continued to fall
since July 1. The commanding officer of the GSDF
34th Infantry Regiment (Itazuma) received a request
for dispatch of disaster relief from the governor of
Shizuoka Prefecture on July 3. The regiment conducted
life-saving activities, collected information about the
damage, and dispatched liaison officers to the area.
These activities continued for about a month until the
governor’s request for withdrawal of disaster relief was
received on July 31. During this time, a cumulative total
of about 27,000 personnel (including 11,000 personnel
at the disaster site) were mobilized.
Specific activities included life-saving activities,
such as search and rescue operations in the vicinity of
the site by the GSDF 34th Infantry Regiment (Itazuma),
32nd Infantry Regiment (Omiya), 1st Tank Battalion
(Komakado), ASDF Central Aircraft Control and
Warning Wing (Iruma), 3rd Technical School (Ashiya),
and other units. In addition, the GSDF 34th Infantry
Regiment, 1st Engineer Battalion (Asaka), and other
units conducted road clearing by removing sediment
and debris accumulated on National Route 135 and
other roads near the activity area (approximately 1,020
m of road cleared in total).
As for the collection of damage information, the GSDF
Eastern Army Aviation Group (Tachikawa) collected
information via UH-1 helicopters and transmitted
images of the disaster site. All-weather drones from
the GSDF Ground Component Command (Asaka), 1st
Division (Nerima), and ASDF Air Defense Command
(Yokota) were also used to collect information and
transmit images of the disaster site.
Finally, liaison offers were dispatched from these
units to the Shizuoka Prefectural Government, Atami
City Office and the local headquarters in Izusan to

coordinate closely with the local authorities and others
concerned.
b. Disaster Relief in Response to Heavy Rain from
August 2021
In the early morning of August 13, 2021, a landslide
occurred in Unzen City, Nagasaki Prefecture. That day,
the commanding officer of the GSDF 16th Infantry
Regiment (Omura) received a request from the governor
of Nagasaki Prefecture for dispatch of disaster relief
for live-saving activities. Thereafter, the 16th Infantry
Regiment (Omura) and other units carried out lifesaving activities until the request for withdrawal was
received on August 19. During this time, the ASDF 8th
Air Wing (Tsuiki) and 3rd Technical School (Ashiya)
conducted search activities using rescue dogs.
On August 14, 2021, the Rokkaku River in Saga
Prefecture flooded, and the commanding officer of the
GSDF Western Army Combined Brigade (Kurume)
received a request from the governor of Saga Prefecture
for dispatch of disaster relief for life-saving activities.
Following this, the GSDF Western Army Field Artillery
Regiment (Kurume, Kusu), MSDF Sasebo Explosive
Ordnance Disposal Unit (Sasebo), the ASDF Ashiya Air
Rescue Squadron (Ashiya), and so on, conducted lifesaving activities using boats, aircraft, other equipment
until August 18, when the request for withdrawal was
received.
c. Disaster Relief to Prevent the Spread of CommunityAcquired Infections of COVID-19
COVID-19 has become a global pandemic and is
regarded as a serious security threat to the international
community, including Japan. The MOD/SDF have
made a variety of all-out efforts to prevent the spread
of COVID-19.
Between April 2021 and the end of March 2022, the
SDF, in response to requests from prefectural governors,
continued to conduct disaster relief operations to
prevent the spread of community-acquired infections of
COVID-19, which had been ongoing since FY2020. In
total, the SDF provided support for infection prevention
education to approximately 60 local government
employees in seven municipalities,[1] medical support in
two municipalities, and transport of approximately 20
patients in 17 municipalities from outbreaks on remote
islands.


d. Disaster Relief in Response to Highly Pathogenic
Avian Influenza Outbreaks
In response to disaster relief requests from the governors
of each prefecture, the SDF provided support such as
culling poultry at poultry farms in Akita, Hyogo, and
Ehime prefectures where Highly Pathogenic Avian
Influenza outbreaks occurred between April 2021 and
the end of March 2022.
These missions engaged a cumulative total of around
2,200 personnel.
e. Disaster Relief in Response to Classical Swine Fever
(CSF) Outbreak
Between April 2021 and the end of March 2022, the
occurrence of CSF were confirmed in Gunma, Mie,
Tochigi, and Miyagi prefectures. As prompt epidemic
prevention measures, including slaughter of pigs, were
required, the SDF assisted with the slaughter and other
measures in response to disaster relief requests from the
governors of each prefecture. These missions engaged a
cumulative total of around 4,400 personnel.
f. Disaster Relief in Response to Forest Fire
From April 2021 and the end of March 2022, local
authorities conducted firefighting operations against
forest fires that break out in Ibaraki, Gunma, Fukushima,
Kumamoto, and Oita prefectures, but they were unable
to extinguish the fire despite their efforts. Based on
disaster relief requests issued by the governors of the
prefectures, the SDF conducted aerial firefighting and
other operations. The SDF dispatched a cumulative total
of about 860 personnel, about 50 vehicles, and about 30
aircraft.
Furthermore, in FY2021, the SDF carried out
24 dispatches of firefighting support, with 16 cases
responding to fire in the areas near SDF facilities.

See Reference 17 (Record of Disaster Relief (Past Five Years))

**(2) Transportation of Emergency Patients**
The SDF uses its aircraft to transport emergency patients
from isolated islands and remote areas with insufficient
medical facilities (transportation of emergency patients).
In FY2021, out of a total of 383 cases of disaster relief,
315 cases involved the transportation of emergency
patients, with dispatches to remote islands such as
the Southwestern Islands (Okinawa and Kagoshima
Prefectures), the Ogasawara Islands (Tokyo), and
remote islands of Nagasaki Prefecture representing the

**(5) Collaboration with Local Governments and Other**
**Relevant Organizations**

It is important for the MOD/SDF to strengthen
collaboration with local governments and other
relevant organizations under normal circumstances for
the purpose of conducting disaster relief operations
smoothly. For this reason, the SDF implements various
measures including: (1) Assignment of the post of Liaison
Officer for Civil Protection and Disaster Management
(administrative official) at the SDF Provincial
Cooperation Offices; (2) Temporary assignment of
SDF officers to the department in charge of disaster
prevention at the Tokyo Metropolitan Government,
and mutual exchange between administrative officials
of both the GSDF Middle Army and Hyogo Prefectural
Government; and (3) Recommendation of retired SDF
personnel with knowledge in disaster prevention at the
requests of local governments.
As of the end of March 2022, as many as 601 retired
SDF personnel are working in disaster prevention
and other sections in 426 local governments in 45
prefectures throughout the country. Such cooperation in
human resources is a very effective way of strengthening
collaboration between the MOD/SDF and local
governments, and its efficacy was confirmed through
the experiences of the Great East Japan Earthquake and
other disasters. In particular, each GSDF regional army
establishes a forum for interaction with senior directors
for crisis management and other officials from local
governments, and shares information and exchanges
opinions to strengthen collaboration with those local
governments.
In the event of a disaster, liaison officers are sent
quickly and effectively from the units to the local
municipalities in order to ensure smooth coordination.

**(6) Actions Based on the Five-Year Acceleration**
**Measures for Disaster Prevention, Mitigation,**
**and Building National Resilience**

In December 2020, the five-year acceleration measures
for disaster prevention, mitigation, and building national
resilience[2] were approved by the Cabinet. Under the
measures, the MOD intensively focuses on measures
for mechanical equipment materials, etc., at SDF


majority of such cases.
In addition, the SDF carries out sea rescues upon
requests by the Japan Coast Guard on such occasions as
transport of emergency patients from vessels navigating
areas of ocean far from the mainland where the aircraft
of other organizations are unable to respond, due to
reasons including a short flight range and emergencies of
vessels due to incidents such as capsizing. Furthermore,
the SDF conducts long-distance transportation for
serious-case patients, by the ASDF transport aircraft
C-130H utilizing its mobile medical units in certain
occasions.

**(3) The MOD/SDF Response to Nuclear Disasters**
In order to respond to nuclear disasters, the MOD/SDF
has formulated “The SDF Nuclear Disaster Response
Plan.” The SDF also participates in general nuclear
disaster prevention drills jointly implemented by the
government, local governments, and nuclear operators,
to confirm the effectiveness of municipal governments’
evacuation plan and to strengthen cooperation with
relevant agencies in a nuclear disaster emergency.

**(4) Formulating Plans for Responding to Various**
**Disasters**

In the event of the occurrence of various disasters, the
MOD/SDF will take all possible measures such as swift
transportation and deployment of sufficiently sized
units in their initial response. By establishing a rotating
staffing posture, the MOD/SDF is able to respond over
the long-term. In doing so, the MOD/SDF will fully
take into account the lessons learned from the Great
East Japan Earthquake and other disasters.
The MOD/SDF formulates various contingency plans
for responses to large-scale earthquakes, which are
under consideration at the Central Disaster Management
Council, based on the Ministry of Defense Disaster
Prevention Plan to respond to such earthquakes.
In particular, in FY2021, the Cabinet Office released
estimates of fatalities from a megaquake in the Japan
Trench or the Chishima Trench. The MOD will deepen
its considerations to date based on these estimates.


In recent years, the Heavy Rain in July 2018, Typhoon Jebi in 2018, the Hokkaido Eastern Iburi Earthquake in 2018 and other natural disasters caused function loss of important infrastructures
necessary for living and economic activities of the people, including the occurrence of blackouts and closure of airport terminals, which had a major effect on the activities. Learning from the
experience, the Emergency Countermeasures stipulate physical and non-physical measures that individual ministries and agencies should implement intensively for the period of three years from

Japan intends to create a seamless posture and
secure its peace and security by effectively utilizing the
deterrence capabilities of the U.S. military together with
Japan’s own national defense architecture.

**2 Maintenance of Peace and Stability in**
**the Region surrounding Japan**

Article 6 of the Japan-U.S. Security Treaty states
that contributing to the security of Japan and the
maintenance of international peace and security in the
Far East is the purpose of the use of facilities and areas
by the USFJ. This provision is based on the recognition
that the security of Japan is closely tied to the peace and
security of the Far East region to which Japan belongs.
In the regions surrounding Japan, there are many
states and the like with massive military power, including
some states that retain nuclear weapons or continue
nuclear development. In addition, uncertainty over the
existing order is increasing due to changes in the balance
of power. The so-called gray-zone situations harbor the
risk of rapidly developing into graver situations without
showing clear indications.
In such a security environment, the military presence
of USFJ provides deterrence against unexpected
contingencies caused by various security issues or
destabilizing factors, not only protecting the interests of
Japan and the United States but also providing a great
sense of security to the nations in the region and thus
fulfilling a role as public goods.
Also, the close bonds of cooperation based on


the Japan-U.S. Security Arrangements constitute the
foundation of the United States’ commitment to the
peace and stability of the region surrounding Japan.
These arrangements, complemented by the alliances
established between the United States and other
countries in the region such as the Republic of Korea
(ROK), Australia, Thailand, and the Philippines, and
also by the friendly relations developed with other
countries, play an indispensable role in maintaining the
peace and stability of the region.

**3 Responding to Global Issues**

The Japan-U.S. Security Arrangements are the
foundation for a comprehensive and friendly cooperative
relationship between Japan and the United States,
not only in defense but also in a wide range of areas,
including politics, economy, and society.
The Japan-U.S. Alliance, with the Japan-U.S.
Security Arrangements at its core, also forms the axis of
Japan’s foreign policy. It contributes to Japan’s ability
to implement positive efforts to maintain the peace
and security of the international community, including
the promotion of multinational security dialogue and
cooperation, and cooperation with the United Nations.
Currently, we are confronted with global security
challenges that are difficult for any single country to
tackle alone, including risks concerning stable use
of the seas, outer space and cyberspace, the acts of
piracy, proliferation of weapons of mass destruction
and ballistic missiles, and international terrorism, and

it is important for countries to work together from
peacetime. The strong bonds forged between Japan and
the United States are also playing an important role in
the efforts implemented by Japan to effectively respond
to such challenges.
In particular, under the Japan-U.S. Security
Arrangements, the SDF and the U.S. Forces are working
together in peacetime in a variety of areas to strengthen
their cooperation. This close coordination lays the


such as counter-piracy, undertaken by the SDF and the
U.S. Forces, and leads to enhancement of the operational
effectiveness of the Japan-U.S. Security Arrangements.
The peace and prosperity of the international
community are closely linked to those of Japan.
Accordingly, by advancing initiatives for resolving
global issues in cooperation with the United States,
which has remarkable operational capabilities, Japan
will be able to further ensure its security and prosperity.

**1** **Strengthened Coordination within the Alliance**

**(1) Establishment of the Alliance Coordination**
**Mechanism (ACM)**

In November 2015, the Japanese and U.S. Governments
established the ACM in order to seamlessly and
effectively address any situation that affects Japan’s
peace and security or any other situation that may
require an Alliance response.
Based on the framework shown in Fig. III-2-1-3,
the ACM coordinates policy and operational aspects
related to activities conducted by the SDF and the U.S.
Forces in all phases from peacetime to contingencies.
This mechanism also contributes to timely information
sharing as well as to the development and maintenance
of common situational awareness.
The characteristics of the mechanism include that (1)


it is the standing mechanism utilizable from peacetime;
(2) it can be utilized for large-scale natural disasters in
Japan as well as for cooperation in the Indo-Pacific region
and globally; and (3) it enables whole-of-government
coordination while ensuring the involvement of relevant
Japanese and U.S. organizations. These characteristics
enable the Japanese and U.S. Governments to
respond appropriately and promptly when the need
for coordination arises. For example, in the event of a
largescale natural disaster in Japan, it would require a
diversity of coordination in the policy and operational
aspects related to activities of the SDF and the U.S.
Forces. The utilization of this mechanism makes it
possible to conduct close and appropriate coordination
with the involvement of relevant Japanese and U.S.
organizations at various levels.
Since the establishment of the mechanism, Japan and
the United States have been utilizing the mechanism
to coordinate closely, including in response to the
Kumamoto Earthquake, the ballistic missile launches by
North Korea, and Chinese activities in the waters and
airspace around the Senkaku Islands.

**(2) Enhanced Operational Coordination**
Based on the Guidelines, the Japanese and U.S.
Governments recognize the importance of collocating
operational coordination functions. The SDF and the
U.S. Forces will exchange personnel to ensure robust
information sharing, to facilitate coordination and to
support international activities.

**(3) Establishment of the Bilateral Planning**
**Mechanism (BPM)**

Based on the Guidelines, the Japanese and U.S.
Governments established the BPM in November 2015
for the purpose of implementing the development of
bilateral plans in peacetime in line with the Guidelines
in order to enable effective bilateral responses to
contingencies relevant to Japan’s peace and security.
In the development of bilateral plans, this mechanism
performs the functions of ensuring Ministerial-level
directions and supervision and the involvement of
relevant government ministries and agencies, as well
as conducting coordination for various forms of JapanU.S. cooperation conducive to the development of
bilateral plans. The two governments will conduct
bilateral planning through this mechanism


**2 Strengthening Japan-U.S. Defense**
**Cooperation**

The Guidelines define that Japan and the United States
will work on a variety of measures from peacetime,
including ISR activities, air and missile defense,
maritime security, training and exercises, asset
protection, and logistics support, and cooperate in such
activities as response to a large-scale disaster in Japan to
seamlessly ensure Japan’s peace and security.
The Guidelines also require both countries: to
cooperate in international activities and promote
and improve trilateral and multilateral cooperation
for regional and global peace and security; to make
cooperation on space and cyberspace; and to develop and
enhance bilateral enterprise through defense equipment
and technology cooperation as well as intelligence
cooperation and information security for further
improving the effectiveness of bilateral cooperation.

**Policy Consultations between Japan and the United States**
**3**

Japan and the United States have maintained close Furthermore, the Japanese State Minister of Defense and the

and ministerial level, and have continually strengthened and
expanded cooperative relations for the peace, stability and
prosperity of not only the two countries but also the entire
international community, including the Indo-Pacific region.
Close policy consultations on security are conducted
through diplomatic channels as well as between officials in
charge of defense and foreign affairs at multiple levels in the
Governments of Japan and the United States through meetings
such as the Japan-United States SCC (“2+2” Meeting), the
SSC and the Subcommittee for Defense Cooperation (SDC).
As the framework for ministerial consultations among the
top officials in charge of defense and foreign affairs of the
two countries, the SCC (“2+2” Meeting) represents such
policy consultations. The SCC functions as an important
consultative panel to discuss issues related to Japan-U.S.
cooperation in the area of security.
In addition, the Ministry of Defense (MOD) organizes
Japan-U.S. defense ministerial meetings between the
Japanese Minister of Defense and the U.S. Secretary of
Defense as necessary where they discuss the defense policies
of the respective governments and defense cooperation.


Furthermore, the Japanese State Minister of Defense and the
U.S. Deputy Secretary of Defense work together, and MOD
officials, including the Vice-Minister of Defense, the Chief
of Staff of the Joint Staff, the Vice-Minister of Defense for
International Affairs, and the Chiefs of Staff of the SDF,
have working-level meetings when necessary and exchange
information with the U.S. Department of Defense (DoD)
and others under the Japan-U.S. Security Arrangements.
The sharing of information and views at every opportunity
and level between Japan and the United States is undoubtedly
conducive to the increased credibility of the Japan-U.S.
Security Arrangements, and results in the further enhancement
of close collaboration between the two countries. Therefore,
the MOD is proactively engaging in these initiatives.

the Transfer of Arms and Military Technologies to
the United States of America signed in 2006.[2] Under
these frameworks, Japan has decided to provide the
United States with 20 items of arms and military
technologies, including military technologies related to
joint technological research on BMD. In addition, at the
Japan-U.S. “2+2” Meeting in January 2022, Japan and
the United States concluded the framework Exchange
of Notes on Cooperative Research, Development,
Production and Sustainment as well as Cooperation
in Testing and Evaluation. Based on this Exchange of
Notes, Japan will advance cooperation with the United
States on emerging technologies. Both countries consult
with each other at forums such as the Systems and
Technology Forum (S&TF) and conduct cooperative
research and development regarding the specific projects
agreed upon at these forums.
Additionally, Japan concluded a Reciprocal Defense
Procurement Arrangement with the United States[3] in
June 2016, following which the Ministers signed a
Reciprocal Defense Procurement Memorandum of
Understanding (RDP MOU)[4] at the Japan-U.S. Defense
Ministerial Meeting in that same month. The MOU
promotes measures based on reciprocity (providing
information necessary to tender bids for businesses
of the other country, protecting submitted corporate
information, waiving restrictions on participation by
businesses of the other country, etc.), concerning the
procurement of equipment by Japanese and U.S. defense
authorities. The expiration of the Arrangement and the
MOU was extended in May 2021.
Part IV, Chapter 4, Section 5-2 (Deepening
Relationships with the United States regarding Defense
Equipment and Technology Cooperation) explains the
production, sustainment and maintenance of common
equipment (F-35 fighter aircraft and Ospreys) between
Japan and the United States.


**2 Joint/Shared Use**

The expansion of joint/shared use of facilities and areas
also means an increase of bases for the SDF’s activities
such as maneuver areas, ports, and airfields, which in
turn enables closer operational coordination, expanded
interoperability, and improved flexibility and resilience
during bilateral activities. The SDF has only a limited
number of facilities in Okinawa, including Naha Air
Base of the ASDF, and most of them are located in urban
areas, which has limited its operations. The joint/shared
use of U.S. Forces facilities and areas in Okinawa will
greatly improve the SDF’s training environment in
Okinawa, and facilitate implementation of bilateral/
multilateral training and exercises and expanded
interoperability between the SDF and the U.S. Forces. It
will also improve readiness and contribute to ensuring
the safety of local people in case of a disaster.
Thus, while taking into account the SDF defense
posture in the regions, including the Southwestern
Islands, and relations with local communities, Japan
and the United States are proactively engaged in
consultations, and specific initiatives are steadily
progressing. For example, the GSDF has been using
Camp Hansen since March 2008 for training. Moreover,
the relocation of the ASDF Air Defense Command
Headquarters to Yokota in April 2012 and the relocation
of the then GSDF Central Readiness Force Headquarters
to Zama in March 2013 were carried out. In addition,

-----

**(2) Satisfying Labor Requirements of the USFJ**
The SOFA stipulates that the manpower (labor) required
by the USFJ shall be satisfied with the assistance of the
Government of Japan.
As of the end of FY2021, there were 25,840 USFJ
local employees (hereinafter referred to as the “USFJ
employees”) at USFJ facilities and areas throughout
Japan, working as clerks at headquarters, engineers at
maintenance/supply facilities, members of security guards
and fire departments on base, and sales staff at welfare/
recreational facilities. They support the smooth operations
of the USFJ.
The Government of Japan hires these USFJ employees
in accordance with the provisions of the SOFA. The
MOD supports the stationing of the USFJ by performing
administrative work for personnel management, payment
of wages, health care, and welfare, etc.

**(3) Supplementary Agreement on Cooperation in the**
**Field of Environmental Stewardship**

In September 2015, the governments of Japan and the
United States signed and effectuated the Agreement on
Cooperation in the Field of Environmental Stewardship
relating to the USFJ, supplementary to the SOFA. This
supplementary agreement represents an international
commitment with legal binding force and sets forth
provisions concerning the issuance and maintenance of
the Japan Environmental Governing Standards (JEGS)
and the establishment and maintenance, etc., of procedures
for access to USFJ facilities and areas. This agreement
was the first of its kind created to supplement the SOFA
since the SOFA had entered into force and has a historical
significance that differs essentially in nature from
conventional improvements in the operations of the SOFA.

See Part IV, Chapter 6, Section 2-2 (Efforts on the USFJ Facilities

See

and Areas)


**(4)** **Supplementary Agreement on Civilian Component**
In January 2017, the governments of Japan and the United
States signed the Supplementary Agreement on Civilian
Component, which came into force on the same day.
This Supplementary Agreement clarifies the scope of the
civilian component, which is addressed only by a general
provision in SOFA, in addition to developing criteria used
in evaluating contractor employee positions for eligibility to
receive designation as members of the civilian component,
and stipulates the procedures for notification and review,
etc., together with the exclusion of ordinary residents from
the civilian component. The initiative to formulate the
Supplementary Agreement on Civilian Component is the
second case, following the creation of the Supplementary
Agreement on the Environment that supplements the SOFA.

**(5) The Revision of the Guidelines Regarding Off-**
**Base U.S. Military Aircraft Accidents**

In July 2019, the governments of Japan and the United
States agreed on the revision of the Guidelines Regarding
Aircraft Accidents in Japan.[4] This revision aims to refine
the procedures for access to the site by Japanese and U.S.
government officials in the event of off-base U.S. military
aircraft accidents that occur in Japan, and so on. These
changes enable more effective, expeditious and proper
response to future U.S. military aircraft accidents.

**3 USFJ-Related Costs**

USFJ-related costs include Host Nation Support, or HNS,
costs for implementing the stipulations of the SACO Final
Report to mitigate the impact on the people of Okinawa, as
well as costs for implementing measures that contribute to
mitigating the impact on the local communities associated
with the initiatives for the realignment of the U.S. Forces.

See Fig. III-2-4-1 (USFJ-Related Costs (Budget for FY2022))

**4 HNS**

HNS plays an important role to ensure the smooth and
effective implementation of the Japan-U.S. Security
Arrangements. Due to soaring prices and wages in Japan
since the mid-1970s, and changes in the international
economic situation, Japan began to bear labor costs such
as welfare costs for USFJ local employees in FY1978.
Then in FY1979, it started to bear costs for the Facilities

Notes 1: Training relocation costs under the SMA extend into HNS(cost sharing for the stationing of USFJ) as well as SACO-related costs and the realignment-related costs.
2: The SACO-related costs refer to the costs for implementing the contents of the SACO Final Report to reduce the impact on the people of Okinawa, while the

realignment-related costs refer to the costs relating to measures to contribute to reducing the impact on local communities as a part of the realignment initiatives. On the
other hand, since HNS is Japan's voluntary effort to bear some costs in light of the importance of ensuring the smooth and effective implementation of the Japan-U.S.
Security Arrangements, its nature is different from the SACO-related costs and the realignment-related costs, and is categorized separately.

3: The costs for the stationing of USFJ include the MOD-related budget, other ministry-related budgets (base subsidy, etc.: ¥40 billion, FY2021 budget) and the estimated costs

of government-owned land provided for use as USFJ facilities (¥164.3 billion, FY2021 estimate).

In addition, as labor costs soared due to changes in
economic conditions surrounding both countries, there
arose a concern that the employment stability of the
employees would be undermined, and then the activities of


the USFJ could be affected. Therefore, in 1987, Japan and
the United States concluded an agreement that sets forth
special measures regarding Article 24 of the SOFA (the
Special Measures Agreement, or SMA)[5] as exceptional,
limited, and provisional measures relating to the cost

sharing principle of the SOFA.
Based on this SMA, Japan started to bear labor costs of
eight categories such as the adjustment allowance (currently
replaced by the regional allowance). As the SMA was
revised later on, the costs shared by Japan have expanded
to cover labor costs including base pay and utilities costs
from FY1991, training relocation costs from FY1996, and
training equipment and materials procurement costs from
FY2022.


that negotiations would be continued towards the agreement
of a new SMA beyond April 1, 2022.
Through subsequent negotiations, on December 21,
2021, Japan and U.S. foreign and defense authorities
reached consensus to not only (1) support the smooth and

to (2) contribute to more effectively enhancing deterrence
and response capabilities of the Japan-U.S. Alliance and

is extremely important from the perspective of security,
as Okinawa serves as a strategically important target for
neighboring countries in both making access to the Pacific

the continent.
Thus the stationing of the U S Forces in Okinawa

range of missions with high mobility and readiness, along
with the above-mentioned geographical characteristics,
further ensures the effectiveness of the Japan-U.S. Alliance,
strengthens deterrence, and contributes greatly not only to
the security of Japan but also to the peace and stability of

the Indo-Pacific region.
On the other hand, Okinawa has many U.S. Forces
facilities and areas such as air bases, maneuver areas and
logistics facilities. As of January 1, 2022, approximately
70% of U.S. Forces facilities and areas (for exclusive
use) are concentrated in Okinawa Prefecture, occupying
approximately 8% of the land area of the prefecture
and approximately 14% of the main island of Okinawa.
Therefore, it is necessary to make utmost efforts to mitigate
the impact on Okinawa, while also considering the abovementioned security standpoints.

**1 Initiatives for Realignment,**
**Consolidation, and Reduction of U.S.**
**Forces Facilities and Areas in Okinawa**

When Okinawa was returned to Japan in 1972, the
Government of Japan provided 83 facilities and areas
covering approximately 278 km[2] for exclusive use as U.S.
Forces facilities and areas. On the other hand, U.S. Forces
facilities and areas were strongly requested to be realigned,
consolidated and reduced, on the grounds that they
seriously affect the lives of people in Okinawa Prefecture.
Both countries have continued their initiatives to realign,
consolidate, and reduce U.S. Forces facilities and areas,
centering on those subjects to the strong local requests,
and, in relation to the so-called 23 issues, it was agreed
in 1990 that both sides would proceed with the required
coordination and procedures toward the return of land.
Moreover, it was agreed in 1995 that initiatives would also
be made to resolve the so-called Three Okinawa Issues:

training over Highway 104.
Subsequently, in response to an unfortunate incident
that occurred in 1995, as well as the refusal of the then
Governor of Okinawa to sign land lease renewal documents
under the Act on Special Measures for USFJ Land Release,
the Government of Japan decided to devote even greater
initiatives towards realignment, consolidation, and
reduction, believing that the impact should be shared by
the whole nation. In order to hold consultations on issues
related to U.S. Forces facilities and areas in Okinawa, the
Government of Japan established the Okinawa Action
Council between the central government and Okinawa
Prefecture, and the Special Action Committee on Okinawa
(SACO) between Japan and the United States, and the socalled SACO Final Report was compiled in 1996.


reduction, and the improvement of operational procedures
regarding the SOFA procedures, and also refers to the
related facilities and areas covered. The land to be returned
based on the SACO Final Report represents approximately
21% (about 50 km[2]) of U.S. Forces facilities and areas in
Okinawa at that time, exceeding the amount of land returned
during the period between the reversion of Okinawa and
the implementation of the SACO Final Report, which is
roughly 43 km[2].

Roadmap related to the realignment of the U.S. Forces, the
measures have been implemented to alleviate the impact
on the local communities in Okinawa while maintaining
the deterrence capabilities.
The Government of Japan believes that it is imperative
not to allow MCAS Futenma to remain indefinitely at its
current location, which is in the vicinity of houses, schools,
etc., in the center of Ginowan City, Okinawa Prefecture,
and considers that this is a fundamental idea shared between
the Government of Japan and the people of Okinawa.
As for the relocation of MCAS Futenma, the Government
of Japan has not changed its stance that the current plan to
construct the FRF at the Camp Schwab Henokosaki area
(Nago City) and adjacent waters is the only solution to
avoid the continued use of MCAS Futenma.
The Government of Japan will make further efforts to
achieve the relocation and return of MCAS Futenma as
early as possible and to mitigate the impact on Okinawa
in a speedy manner. The return of MCAS Futenma is
expected to eliminate danger in the area and to contribute
to the further growth of Okinawa, including Ginowan City,
through the reuse of the area (approximately 476 ha with a
land area 100 times larger than Tokyo Dome).

**(1) Background Concerning the Futenma**
**Replacement Facility**

Considering the occurrence of the U.S. Forces helicopter
crash in Ginowan City in August 2004, bilateral discussions
on the realignment have been made towards realizing the
relocation and return of MCAS Futenma at the earliest
possible date in order to resolve the concern of the residents
living in the vicinity.
In the SCC (“2+2”) document compiled in October

of Japan reached an agreement with the U.S. side to give
considerations for the natural environment and to relocate
not all seven but the minimum number of six helipads
necessary, and proceeded with the construction work. The
relocation of the helipads completed in December 2016,
and the return of approximately 4,000 ha, a major portion
of the Northern Training Area located in the villages of
Kunigami and Higashi, was achieved based on the SACO
Final Report.
The returned land accounts for approximately 20% of
USFJ facilities and areas (for exclusive use) in Okinawa.
The return is the largest one since the reversion of Okinawa
to the mainland, and had been an issue for 20 years since
the SACO Final Report in 1996.
Based on the Act on Special Measures Concerning
Promotion of Effective and Appropriate Use of the Lands
in Okinawa Prefecture Previously Provided for Use by
the Stationed Forces, the MOD took measures to remove
obstacles (such as soil contamination survey, etc.) so that the
landowners, etc., could use returned lands effectively and
appropriately, and transferred the land to the landowners
in December 2017. In addition, in July 2021, the northern
part of the main island of Okinawa, including the returned
lands, was inscribed as the World Natural Heritage Site as
part of “Amami-Oshima Island, Tokunoshima Island, the
northern part of Okinawa Island and Iriomote Island.”

In May 2006 along with the initiatives set forth in the


**Chapter**

2005, the initiative to locate the FRF in L -shaped
configuration that combines the shoreline areas of Camp
Schwab and adjacent water areas of Oura Bay” was
approved. However, since this L-shape meant that U.S.
military aircraft would fly over settlements in Nago City
and Ginoza Village, a request was submitted to avoid
flights over these settlements.
In light of this, based on negotiation and agreement
with the local municipalities including Nago City, it was
decided to stipulate in the Roadmap that the FRF be located
in a V-shape configuration that “combines Henokosaki
and adjacent water areas of Oura and Henoko Bays.”
With regard to construction of this replacement facility,
“a Memorandum of Basic Understanding” was exchanged
between the then Governor of Okinawa Inamine and the
then Minister of State for Defense Nukaga in May 2006.
After the change of government in September 2009,
the Exploratory Committee for Okinawa Base Issues was
established. After reviews conducted by the Committee,
both governments, at the “2+2” Meeting held in May 2010,
confirmed the intention to locate the FRF in the Camp
Schwab Henokosaki area and the adjacent waters, and
decided that a study by experts regarding the replacement
facility’s location, configuration and construction method
would be completed promptly. The two sides also agreed to
take concrete measures to mitigate the impact on Okinawa.
Subsequently, at the “2+2” Meeting held in June 2011, it


was decided that the runway would take a V-shape.
During the deliberation process which led to these
conclusions, first of all, it was determined that, from a
security perspective, the deterrence of the U.S. Forces,
including that of the U.S. Marine Corps stationed in
Okinawa that is located in a crucial area for the security of
Japan, cannot be lessened while there remains instability
and uncertainty in the security environment in East Asia.
Furthermore, concern was expressed that the functions
of the U.S. Marine Corps such as mobility and readiness
would be weakened if the helicopter units stationed at
MCAS Futenma were to be detached from the other Marine
units stationed in Okinawa and moved abroad or out of the
prefecture. Therefore, it was concluded that the FRF had to
be located within Okinawa Prefecture.
Also at the “2+2” Meetings in April 2012, October
2013, April 2015, August 2017, April 2019, March 2021,
and January 2022, and in other instances including the
joint statement issued at the Japan-U.S. summit meetings
in February and November 2017, April 2018, April 2021,
and May 2022, the governments of Japan and the United
States confirmed that the plan to construct the FRF at Camp
Schwab Henokosaki area and adjacent waters is the only
solution that avoids the continued use of MCAS Futenma.

training and other purposes are located over residential
areas, whereas flight paths in the FRF will be changed to
over the sea, thereby reducing noise and risks.
For example, while more than 10,000 households are
located in areas requiring housing noise insulation near
MCAS Futenma, there will be zero households requiring
such insulation around the FRF. This means that the noise
levels experienced by all households will comply with the
environment criteria applied to exclusive housing areas. In
the case that an aircraft encounters any contingency, safety
on the ground can be ensured by diverting the aircraft
offshore.

**(3) The Necessity of Constructing the FRF in**
**Okinawa Prefecture**

The U.S. Maritime Corps in Okinawa consists of air,
ground, logistics, and command elements. The interaction
of those elements is indispensable for U.S. Marine Corps
operations characterized by great mobility and readiness,
so the FRF needs to be located within Okinawa Prefecture
so that rotary-wing aircraft stationed at MCAS Futenma
will be located near the elements with which they train,
operate, or otherwise work on a regular basis.

**(4) Completion of Environmental Impact**
**Assessment Procedures**

The MOD sent the environmental impact assessment
scoping document in 2007 to the Governor of Okinawa
and other parties. After the MOD worked on revising the
document based on the opinions provided by the governor,
the MOD completed the environmental impact assessment
procedures by sending the revised assessment document
to related parties including the governor in December
2012, while making the assessment document available for
public review.
Throughout these procedures, the MOD received a total
of 1,561 opinions from the Governor of Okinawa on six
occasions, made all the required revisions, and reflected
them in the content of the environmental assessment. In
this way, the MOD had taken steps to comply with relevant
laws, asked opinions and ideas from Okinawa Prefecture
over a sufficient period of time, and reflected them in the
assessment.

**(2) Relocation of MCAS Futenma and Mitigation of**
**the Impact on Okinawa**

The relocation of MCAS Futenma holds more significance
than merely moving the facility from one location to
another. Rather, it involves reduction in the base’s functions
and area in Okinawa, and contributes greatly to mitigating
the impact on Okinawa.
a. Distribution of Functions Offered by MCAS Futenma
MCAS Futenma fulfills the following functions relating to
the aviation capabilities of the U.S. Marine Corps stationed
in Okinawa: (1) Operation of the Osprey and other aircraft;
(2) Operation of air refueling aircraft; and (3) Accepting
transient aircraft in contingencies. Of these three functions,
only “(1) operation of the Osprey and other aircraft” will
be relocated to Camp Schwab. As for “(2) operation of air
refueling aircraft,” all 15 KC-130 air refueling aircraft were
relocated to MCAS Iwakuni (in Iwakuni City, Yamaguchi
Prefecture) in August 2014.
This marked the completion of a task that has remained
unresolved for 18 years since the SACO Final Report
in 1996, enabling a vast majority of fixed-wing aircraft
located in MCAS Futenma to be moved outside Okinawa
Prefecture. This move also led to the relocation of
approximately 870 USFJ personnel, civilian employees,
and dependents.
Moreover, the function of “(3) accepting transient
aircraft in contingencies” will also be transferred to Tsuiki
Air Base and Nyutabaru Air Base. In October 2018, Japan
and the United States agreed on developing facilities that
would be necessary for relocating the function, and related
work such as construction of the facilities has been carried
out.
b. Reduction in Area
The area required for the land reclamation to build the
FRF is approximately 150 ha, less than one-third of the
approximately 476 ha of MCAS Futenma, and the FRF
will be equipped with a significantly shorter runway at
1,200 m (1,800 m including the overruns) compared to the
current runway length of 2,740 m at MCAS Futenma.
c. Reduction in Noise and Risks
Two runways will be constructed in a V-shape, which
enables the flight path for takeoff and landing to be
located over the sea, in line with the requests of the local
community In MCAS Futenma flight paths used daily for

to Okinawa Prefecture in March 2013, and then Governor
of Okinawa Nakaima approved this in December 2013.
However, then Governor of Okinawa Onaga revoked the
landfill permit in October 2015, leading to the filing of three
suits over the revocation of the landfill permit between the
Government of Japan and Okinawa Prefecture.[6]

Under these circumstances, the court came up with
a settlement recommendation, and the Government of
Japan and Okinawa Prefecture reached a court-mediated
settlement agreement in March 2016. In the settlement,
the Government of Japan and Okinawa mutually affirmed
that after the final judicial ruling is handed down by the
Supreme Court, they would abide by the ruling and take
steps in line with the spirit of the text of the ruling and
the reasons conducive to the text, and continue to take
responses in good faith by cooperating with each other in
accordance with the purpose of the ruling.
Pursuant to the provisions of the settlement agreement,
the Okinawa Defense Bureau immediately suspended the
landfill work while the Minister of Land, Infrastructure,
Transport and Tourism issued an instruction for correction
based on the Local Autonomy Act to then Governor Onaga
to repeal the revocation of the landfill permit. Subsequently,
in December 2016, after examination by the Central and
Local Government Dispute Management Council and
deliberation by the Naha Branch of the Fukuoka High
Court, the Supreme Court set forth the decision that the
revocation of the landfill permit by then Governor Onaga
was illegal.
b. Judgment of the Supreme Court
In the judgment, the Supreme Court ruled that then
Governor Nakaima’s decision was not illegal. The court
stated that no circumstances could be found indicating that
then Governor Nakaima’s decision that the landfill was in
compliance with the condition in Article 4 (1) (i) of the Act
on Reclamation of Publicly-owned Water Surface, “that it
is appropriate and reasonable as the use of national land,”
had no foundation in fact, or clearly lacked reasoning under
socially accepted conventions. The reasons given by the
court include: (1) the area of the replacement facilities and
the landfill area will be significantly reduced from the area of
the MCAS Futenma facilities, and (2) flights over residential
areas by aircraft can be avoided by the landfill in the coastal


area that puts the runway extension out to sea.
Moreover, regarding whether the construction of
replacement facilities takes environmental protection and
other considerations into adequate account, the Supreme
Court, found that construction methods, environmental
protection measures and countermeasures that can
conceivably be taken at this point in time have been
taken and that there is sufficient consideration for disaster
prevention. The Supreme Court determined that it cannot
be said that then Governor Nakaima’s decision was illegal.
The court did not find that there was anything particularly
unreasonable in then Governor Nakaima’s decisionmaking process and the content of the decision that the
construction met the condition of Article 4 (1) (ii) of the
Act on Reclamation of Publicly-owned Water Surface, “the
landfill gives sufficient consideration to the protection of
the environment and prevention of disasters.”
c. Retraction of the Revocation of the Landfill Permit
Following this Supreme Court ruling, in December
2016, then Governor Onaga retracted the revocation of the
landfill permit and the Okinawa Defense Bureau resumed
the replacement facilities construction project. In April
2017, it started the construction of the seawall, the main
part of the public waters reclamation.
d. Suit Related to Damage to the Reefs on the Seafloor,
etc.
In July 2017, Okinawa Prefecture filed a suit in the Naha
District Court, requesting that this seawall construction
may not be allowed to damage the reefs on the seafloor, etc.,
without permission from the Governor of Okinawa based
on the regulations of Okinawa Prefecture. Subsequently,
the district court dismissed Okinawa Prefecture’s claim in
March 2018, and the Naha Branch of the Fukuoka High
Court dismissed Okinawa Prefecture’s appeal in December
of the same year. In the same month, Okinawa Prefecture
filed a petition of final appeal with the Supreme Court, but
withdrew the petition in March 2019.
e. Situation Surrounding the Landfill Work
In August 2018, Okinawa Prefecture revoked the landfill
permit again on the basis of problems concerning
environmental protection measures and the soil foundation
of the landfill area. In October of the same year, the Director
General of Okinawa Defense Bureau filed a request with


(1) The suit filed by the Government of Japan (the Minister of Land, Infrastructure, Transport and Tourism) as plaintiff based on the provisions of Article 245-8 of the Local Autonomy Act, seeking
a court ruling instructing a retraction of the revocation of the landfill permit by then Governor Onaga (the so-called subrogation suit); (2) the suit filed by the Governor of Okinawa Prefecture based
on the provisions of Article 251-5 of the Local Autonomy Act, seeking to invalidate the decision to suspend the validity of the revocation of the landfill permit (the decision to stay execution) by the
Minister of Land, Infrastructure, Transport and Tourism as the illegal “involvement of the state;” and (3) the suit filed by Okinawa Prefecture based on the provisions of Article 3 of the Administrative

for the Supreme Court to take up the appeal, but in March
2020 the Supreme Court rejected the request by the
Governor of Okinawa. On the other hand, with regards
to the suit to revoke the ruling, the Naha District Court
dismissed the request by Okinawa Prefecture in November
2020, and Okinawa Prefecture appealed to the Naha Branch
of the Fukuoka High Court. Ultimately, however, the Naha
Branch of the Fukuoka High Court also dismissed Okinawa
Prefecture’s appeal in December 2021. In that same month,
Okinawa Prefecture filed a petition of final appeal with the
Supreme Court.
In implementing the relocation, the MOD has
conducted environmental impact assessment procedures
for approximately five years and has given the utmost
consideration for the natural environment. Throughout the
procedures, more than 1,500 opinions have been expressed
by the Governor of Okinawa on six occasions, all of which
the MOD reflected in the environmental assessment.
If the waters are enclosed by the seawall, the coral
will be isolated from the surrounding sea with the flow of
seawater shut down, a situation which will affect the coral
habitat. Therefore, corals living in the landfill area on the
southern side, which were designated for conservation,
were transplanted before the area was enclosed. The
standard for conservation of corals is stricter than the
standard that was applied to the landfill related to the
second runway of Naha Airport.[7] Regarding coenobita,
which are a nationally designated protected species, and
the shellfish and crustaceans designated as endangered
species, relocation from the seashore and seafloors in the
construction area on the southern side to other areas is also
being appropriately implemented based on instructions and
advice from experts.
Regarding the soil foundation of the landfill area, as a
result of a study conducted on the stability of seawalls and
other structures in the waters north of Camp Schwab in
light of the results of a boring survey, it has been confirmed
that although the work to improve the soil foundation is
necessary, it is possible to implement the construction of
seawalls and landfill while ensuring the required stability
through prevailing and adequately proven construction
methods.[8] Since September 2019, the Technical Review
Committee on Futenma Replacement Facility Construction
Project, consisting of experts in the fields of geotechnical,

the Minister of Land, Infrastructure, Transport and Tourism
for a stay of execution under the Administrative Complaint
Review Act against the revocation of the permit, and the
stay of execution was upheld. Following the ruling, the
Okinawa Defense Bureau started the landfill work in
December of the same year in the waters south of Camp
Schwab. In August 2021, the landfill up to 4.0 m above
sea level was completed, and the landfill work is steadily
progressing. (As of May 2022)
In April 2019, the Minister of Land, Infrastructure,
Transport and Tourism determined that the revocation
of the landfill permit by Okinawa Prefecture should be
repealed. Dissatisfied with this decision, the Governor
of Okinawa filed a request for a review with the Central
and Local Government Dispute Management Council in
the same month. The Council dismissed this request in
June 2019. In July 2019, protesting the dismissal of the
Council, the Governor of Okinawa filed a lawsuit with
the Naha Branch of the Fukuoka High Court to revoke the
government’s involvement (determination by the Minister
of Land, Infrastructure, Transport and Tourism), and
in August 2019 filed a suit with the Naha District Court
seeking the revocation of the determination by the Minister
of Land, Infrastructure, Transport and Tourism.
Of these suits, in October of the same year the Naha
Branch of the Fukuoka High Court dismissed the suit by
the Governor of Okinawa to revoke the government’s
involvement, and the Governor of Okinawa filed a petition


Specifically, in relation to the construction of the second runway of Naha Airport, around 37,000 clusters of small corals were transplanted. If the same standard as the one applicable to the
construction of the alternative facility was applied, the number of clusters of small corals transplanted would have been around 170,000.

The standard methods are the sand compaction pile method, the sand drain method, and the paper drain method. Among examples of projects in which these methods were used is the

structural, coastal, and pavement engineering, has been
held to obtain objective technical recommendations and
advice in order to make the design, construction, and
maintenance of seawalls and landfill sites more rational for
the future implementation of the project.
Also in December 2019, the Okinawa Defense Bureau
announced that, based on the results of the studies that
had been conducted so far, it would take nine years and
three months from the commencement to the completion
of construction according to the revised plan, and about
12 years to complete the “admin procedures” described in
the Okinawa Consolidation Plan and a fund of about 930
billion yen.
After due consideration including hearing experts’
insights on the environment and others, in April 2020,
the Okinawa Defense Bureau submitted to the Governor
of Okinawa Prefecture the Landfill Permit Revision
Request given the additional implementation of the soil
improvement work, etc., based on the Act on Reclamation
of Publicly-owned Water Surface.
In November 2021, the Governor of Okinawa
Prefecture voiced disapproval of the permit revision
request on the grounds that surveys of the soil foundation
and environmental protection measures at the planned
landfill area were inadequate. In response, in December
2021, the Director General of the Okinawa Defense
Bureau filed a request for review with the Minister of
Land, Infrastructure, Transport and Tourism under the
Administrative Complaint Review Act. In April 2022, the
Minister of Land, Infrastructure, Transport and Tourism
determined revocation of the disapproval by the Governor
of Okinawa, and also issued an instruction for correction
based on the Local Autonomy Act to approve the permit
revision request. Dissatisfied with this determination and
the instruction for correction, the Governor of Okinawa
filed respective requests for review with the Central and
Local Government Dispute Management Council in May
2022.
In February 2019, Okinawa Prefecture held a referendum
on whether or not to support the landfill work related to
the relocation of MCAS Futenma to the Henokosaki
area in Nago City. As a result, 114,933 voters voted for
the work, 434,273 voters voted against it, and 52,682
voters voted neither (the total number of votes cast was
605,385 and the voter turnout was 52.48%). The present
situation in which U.S. bases are concentrated in Okinawa
is in no way acceptable, and it is a grave responsibility of
the government to mitigate the impact on Okinawa The


government takes the results of the prefectural referendum
seriously and will continue to do its utmost to mitigate the
impact of the U.S. bases in Okinawa.
It is imperative to prevent MCAS Futenma, which is
surrounded by houses and schools and which is said to be
the most dangerous base in the world, from continuing to
be used indefinitely and to pose a danger. The government
believes that this view is shared with the people of Okinawa.
The relocation to Henoko does not mean that all
functions of MCAS Futenma will be relocated there. Of
MCAS Futenma’s three functions, two will be moved out
of Okinawa while the remaining one will be relocated to
Henoko, resulting in the total return of the site of MCAS
Futenma. Indeed, from the viewpoint of sharing the impact,
progress is being made in implementation of measures to
realize the total return of the site of MCAS Futenma based
on understanding and cooperation by local governments
outside Okinawa. The measures include the relocation
of air refueling aircraft to Yamaguchi Prefecture and the
relocation of the function of accepting transient aircraft in
contingencies to Fukuoka and Miyazaki Prefectures.
Although over 25 years have passed since Japan and
the United States agreed on the total return of the site of
MCAS Futenma, it has not been achieved yet. The MOD
believes that the return must not be postponed any longer.
The Government of Japan intends to continue making
efforts to secure the understanding of local residents in
Okinawa through years of persistent dialogue, and do its
utmost to achieve the total return of MCAS Futenma as
early as possible.

**5 Force Reduction and Relocation to**
**Guam**

Since the Roadmap was announced in May 2006, the
governments of Japan and the United States held a series
of consultations on the reduction of the U.S. Forces in
Okinawa.

**(1) Timing and Size of Relocation**
The 2006 Roadmap stated that approximately 8,000
personnel of the III MEF and their approximate 9,000
dependents would relocate from Okinawa to Guam by
2014, but the “2+2” Meeting in June 2011 and other
agreements set the timing of the relocation for the earliest
possible date after 2014.
Subsequently, at the “2+2” Meeting held in April 2012,
the governments of Japan and the United States decided

to delink both the relocation of III MEF personnel from
Okinawa to Guam and the resulting land return south of
Kadena Air Base from the progress on the FRF and to
adjust the composition of the units and the number of
personnel to be relocated to Guam.
As a result, MAGTF is to be located in Japan, Guam,
and Hawaii, with approximately 9,000 personnel relocated
to locations outside of Japan (about 4,000 of whom are to
be relocated to Guam), bringing the authorized strength of
the U.S. Marine Corps forces in Guam to approximately
5,000 personnel. Meanwhile, the end-state for the U.S.
Marine Corps presence in Okinawa is to be consistent with


the level of approximately 10,000 personnel envisioned in
the Roadmap.
Accordingly, the “2+2” Meeting held in October 2013
agreed that, under the relocation plan described at the
2012 “2+2” Meeting, the relocation of U.S. Marine Corps
units from Okinawa to Guam is to begin in the first half
of the 2020s. The plan is expected to facilitate progress in
implementing the consolidation plan for facilities and areas
in Okinawa of April 2013.
At the “2+2” Meeting in January 2022, the governments
of Japan and the United States confirmed the importance
of accelerating bilateral work on force realignment efforts

including the relocation of approximately 4,000 Marine
Corps personnel from Okinawa to Guam beginning in 2024.

**(2) Costs of the Relocation**
Under the Roadmap, the two sides reached an agreement
that, of the estimated US$10.27 billion (in U.S. fiscal
year 2008 dollars) cost of the facilities and infrastructure
development costs, Japan would provide US$6.09 billion,
including US$2.8 billion in direct cash contribution, while
the United States would fund the remaining US$4.18
billion. In February 2009, the Japanese Government and
the U.S. Government signed “the Agreement Between the
Government of Japan and the Government of the United
States of America Concerning the Implementation of the
Relocation of the III MEF Personnel and Their Dependents
from Okinawa to Guam” (the Guam International
Agreement). The Agreement legally guarantees and
ensures actions taken by Japan and the United States for
projects to which Japan provides direct cash contributions.
As part of measures based on this Agreement,
the Japanese Government has been providing cash
contributions to the U.S. Government in relation to the
projects for which Japan has provided financial support
since FY2009.[9]

Subsequently, at the “2+2” Meeting held in April 2012,
the unit composition and the number of personnel to be
relocated to Guam were adjusted and it was agreed that the
preliminary cost estimate by the U.S. Government for the
relocation was US$8.6 billion (in U.S. FY2012 dollars).
With regard to Japan’s financial commitment, it was
reaffirmed that it was to be the direct cash contribution of
up to US$2.8 billion (in U.S. FY2008 dollars) as stipulated
in Article 1 of the Guam International Agreement. It was
also confirmed that Japan’s equity investment and loans for
family housing projects and infrastructure projects would
not be utilized.[10]

Moreover, it was stipulated that any funds that had
already been provided to the U.S. Government under the
Guam International Agreement would be counted as part of
the Japanese contribution. Furthermore, as a new initiative,
a portion of the direct cash contribution of US$2.8 billion
mentioned above would be used to develop training areas
in Guam and the Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana
Islands as shared-use facilities by Japan and the United
States. In addition, it was agreed that the remaining costs


and any additional costs would be borne by the United
States, and that the two governments were to complete a
bilateral cost breakdown.
At the “2+2” Meeting in October 2013, a Protocol
Amending the Guam International Agreement was also
signed to add the stipulations concerning the development
of training areas in Guam and the Commonwealth of the
Northern Mariana Islands, and the use of these training
areas by the SDF. The limit on Japanese cash contributions
remains unchanged at US$2.8 billion (in U.S. FY2008
dollars). Both countries also completed work reflecting the
breakdown of the associated costs.
Furthermore, the National Defense Authorization Act
for U.S. FY2015 was enacted in December 2014, which
lifted the freeze on the use of funds for the relocation to
Guam imposed by the U.S. Congress in U.S. FY2012.

**(3) Completion of Environmental Impact**
**Assessment Procedures**

As for the environmental impact assessment for Guam, the
required procedures were conducted to reflect the revisions to
the project made by the adjustments to the plan for realignment,
and the assessment was completed in August 2015.
Furthermore, the Commonwealth of the Northern
Mariana Islands Joint Military Training Environmental
Impact Statement (CJMT-EIS), is now being implemented.

**(4) Progress of the Guam Relocation Project**
While the environmental impact assessment for Guam was
being conducted, the Government of the United States
implemented infrastructure development projects at the
Andersen Air Force Base and the Apra area of the Naval
Base Guam as projects unaffected by the assessment. The
U.S. Government is currently implementing relocation
construction work in all project areas, following the lifting
of the freeze on the Guam relocation funds pursuant to the
National Defense Authorization Act and the completion of
the environmental impact assessment for Guam.

of III MEF personnel to Guam, the remaining facilities and
areas on Okinawa will be consolidated, thereby enabling the
return of significant land areas south of Kadena Air Base.
Subsequently, at the “2+2” Meeting in April 2012, it
was decided to delink the progress on the relocation to the
FRF from both the relocation of the III MEF personnel
from Okinawa to Guam and the resulting land returns
south of Kadena. In addition, with regard to the land to be
returned, it was agreed to conduct consultations focusing
on three categories, namely (1) land eligible for immediate
return; (2) land eligible for return once the relocation of
functions is completed; and (3) land eligible for return after
the relocation abroad.

**(1) Consolidation Plan for U.S. Facilities and Areas**
**in Okinawa**


Since the change of administration at the end of 2012, Japan
and the United States have continued consultation under
the basic policy to dedicate all the strength to mitigating
the impact of the U.S. Forces on Okinawa communities.
Japan strongly requested an early return of land areas south
of Kadena, including Makiminato Service Area (Camp
Kinser) in Urasoe City of which Okinawa has particularly
made a strong request for the return and coordinated with
the United States. As a result, both countries announced
the Consolidation Plan for Facilities and Areas in Okinawa
(Consolidation Plan) in April 2013, which stipulated the
return schedule, including the specific years of return.
The return of all land according to the plan will enable
the return of approximately 70% (approximately 1,048 ha,
the equivalent of 220 Tokyo Domes) of six USFJ facilities
for exclusive use[11] located in densely populated areas in the
central and southern parts of the main island of Okinawa. In
the Consolidation Plan, it is confirmed between Japan and
the United States that this plan will be implemented as soon
as possible, and that the government will continue to make
the utmost efforts to return the land south of Kadena, at an
early date.

requested by the local community is being developed.
In addition, returns have been realized ahead of
the schedule in the Consolidation Plan for some areas
where there were strong demands for return by the local
community. This has resulted, for example, in the opening
of the entire stretch of Ginowan City Road 11 in March
2021 on land along the east side of MCAS Futenma, which
has improved local traffic. Furthermore, in May 2022,
Prime Minister Kishida visited the Lower Plaza Housing
Area of Camp Zukeran and announced that Japan and the
United States will agree with the public use of the site as
green space ahead of its return to Japan.
All-out initiatives are being continuously made by the
government to steadily implement the return of land areas


south of Kadena Air Base under the Consolidation Plan and
to mitigate the impact on Okinawa in a tangible manner.

**(2) Deployment of U.S. Air Force CV-22 Osprey to**
**Yokota Air Base**

In May 2015, the United States announced that CV-22,
specified for the U.S. Air Force, would be deployed to
Yokota Air Base (which encompasses Fussa City, Tachikawa
City, Akishima City, Musashi Murayama City, Hamura City,
and Mizuho Town of Tokyo Prefecture). The first five CV-22
Ospreys were deployed to Yokota Air Base in October 2018,
followed by the sixth in July 2021. A total of 10 CV-22s are
scheduled to be deployed in stages by around 2024.
The CV-22 deployed to Yokota Air Base plays a role in
transporting personnel and supplies of the special operation
units of the U.S. Forces to address crises and emergencies in
the Asia-Pacific region, including humanitarian assistance
and natural disasters.
As Japan faces an increasingly severe security
environment, the deployment of high-performance CV-22
enhances the deterrence and response capabilities of the
Japan-U.S. Alliance and contributes to the defense of Japan
and the stability of the region from the perspective of the
commitment by the U.S. to the Asia-Pacific region and the
building-up of readiness by the United States.

**(3) Safety of Osprey**
Prior to the deployment of MV-22s to MCAS Futenma
in 2012, Japan established an analysis and assessment
team composed of aircraft pilots and experts from inside
and outside the government and confirmed the safety of


MV-22 independently. In addition, when Japan made the
decision to introduce Ospreys in 2014, the government
reconfirmed their safety by collecting and analyzing all
kinds of technical information, not only in the preparation
phase, but also after the decision of introduction.
The MOD has dispatched the GSDF Osprey personnel
to the U.S. Marine Corps’ training programs since the fall
of 2016. The personnel who piloted and maintained the
aircraft are of the opinion that the Osprey is a reliable aircraft
that allows for stable maneuvering and maintenance.
Additionally, the CV-22 has the same propulsion system
as the MV-22 and both aircraft also have a basic structure
in common; therefore the safety of both aircraft is at the
same level.
Japan considers that ensuring safety is of prime
importance in operations of the U.S. Forces, and on
various occasions, the Minister of Defense requested the
Secretary of Defense and other high-ranking officials to
give consideration to local communities and ensure safety.
The Government of Japan will continue to ask for the
maximum consideration for safety.

Forces)

In the aftermath of the devastating typhoon that hit the
central part of the Philippines in November 2013, 14 MV22 aircraft, deployed in Okinawa, were dispatched for
humanitarian assistance and disaster relief activities to

promptly to affected areas that were difficult to access, and
transported several hundred isolated victims and about six
tons of relief materials in a day. In April 2014, the MV-22,
deployed in Okinawa, was dispatched for search and rescue
activities in the wake of an accidental sinking of a passenger
ship off the coast of Jindo in the ROK. Furthermore, in
response to the large earthquake that hit Nepal in April 2015,
four MV-22s deployed in Okinawa were dispatched to the
country to transport personnel and supplies.

of Yokota airspace to Japanese authorities, to deploy ASDF
officers at the Yokota Radar Approach Control (Yokota
RAPCON), and to reduce the airspace by about 40% (i.e.,
the release of air traffic control from USFJ).
c. Civilian-Military Dual Use of Yokota Air Base
At the Japan-U.S. summit meeting held in May 2003, it
was agreed that the joint civilian-military use of Yokota
Air Base would be studied, and a Liaison Conference was
then established as a working panel attended by relevant
government ministries and agencies and the Tokyo
Metropolitan Government. The governments of Japan and
the United States are also conducting a study on the specific
conditions and modalities, with the understanding that both
countries will not compromise the military operations and
safety of Yokota Air Base.

**(3) Deployment of U.S. Aircraft Carrier to**
**Commander Fleet Activities, Yokosuka**

The presence of the U.S. Pacific Fleet plays an important
role in ensuring maritime security in the Indo-Pacific


region as well as regional peace and stability. The U.S.
aircraft carrier provides the core capability of the Fleet.
The U.S. Navy affirms that it will continue to ensure
that all of its forward-deployed nuclear-powered vessels,
including USS “Ronald Reagan,”[13] which anchored at
Commander Fleet Activities, Yokosuka (Yokosuka City,
Kanagawa Prefecture), adhere to the relevant safety
policies. For example, the nuclear reactor will normally
be shut down while the aircraft carrier is anchored, and
repairing and refueling will not be carried out in Japan.
The Government of Japan will continue taking all possible
measures to ensure safety.

**(4) Measures Relating to Naval Air Facility Atsugi**
**and MCAS Iwakuni**

a. Relocation of Carrier-Based Aircraft
Since Naval Air Facility Atsugi (Ayase City and Yamato
City in Kanagawa Prefecture) is located in an urban district,
the noise of carrier jets taking off and landing in particular
had been a problem for a long time.


13 Nuclear-powered aircraft carriers do not need to replenish their fuel and they are able to maintain the high speeds necessary for the operation of aircraft, giving them excellent combat and


**Chapter**
**2**


-----

Thus, after the completion of the runway relocation
project[14] at MCAS Iwakuni (Iwakuni City, Yamaguchi
Prefecture), which made aircraft operations possible with
less impact on the living environment of the surrounding
communities, it was decided that CVW-5 squadrons would
be relocated from Naval Air Facility Atsugi to MCAS
Iwakuni. The relocation began in August 2017 and completed
in March 2018. As a result, the noise in areas around Naval
Air Facility Atsugi was alleviated to a significant extent,
while maintaining the forward deployment of a U.S. aircraft
carrier and carrier-based aircraft.
In order to mitigate impacts of the increased operations at
MCAS Iwakuni due to the relocation, the related measures
listed in Fig. III-2-4-18 have been implemented. If all of
these measures are fully implemented, the noise problems
are expected to be mitigated from the current situation,
with the area requiring residential noise-abatement work,
or the so-called first category area, decreasing from
approximately 1,600 ha to approximately 650 ha.

See Fig. III-2-4-18 (Overview of and Measures Related to Naval

See

Air Facility Atsugi and MCAS Iwakuni)

b. Field-Carrier Landing Practice (FCLP)
The May 2006 Roadmap prescribes that a bilateral
framework to conduct a study on a permanent FCLP facility
is to be established with the goal of selecting a permanent
site at the earliest possible date. Since December 2019,
the MOD has acquired approximately 90% of the land on
Mageshima, Nishinoomote City, Kagoshima Prefecture, and
has been explaining the development of facilities to the local
communities in preparation for it. In February 2021, the
MOD began the procedures for the environmental impact
assessment to prepare for the development of facilities.
The FY2022 budget includes funds for facility
development of the runways and parking apron on
Mageshima. The United States also welcomed the
Government of Japan’s decision in its FY 2022 draft
budget to develop SDF facilities on Mageshima in the
joint statement of the SCC issued in January 2022. A new
phase has been reached as the fact that the MOD received
requests from the mayors of Nishinoomote City, Nakatane
Town, and Minamitane Town on Tanegashima Island
regarding the development of facilities on Mageshima
in February 2022 indicates. The MOD has been holding
a series of discussions with the local communities on the
development of facilities, and has established a “Discussion


Forum with Nishinoomote City. In April, Minister of
Defense Kishi visited Mageshima, marking the first visit
by a Minister of Defense.
c. Resumption of Civil Aviation Operations at MCAS
Iwakuni
Considering that the local public entities, etc., including
Yamaguchi Prefecture and Iwakuni City, had been working
together to request the resumption of civil aviation operations,
it was agreed in the Roadmap that “portions of the future
civilian air facility will be accommodated at MCAS Iwakuni.”
Based on this agreement, Iwakuni Kintaikyo Airport was
opened in December 2012, resuming regular flights of civil
aviation aircraft for the first time in 48 years.

**(5) Ballistic Missile Defense (BMD)**
In June 2006, an AN/TPY-2 radar (so-called “X-Band
Radar”) system was deployed to the U.S. Shariki
Communication Site (Tsugaru City in Aomori Prefecture).[15]
Also in October 2006, U.S. Army Patriot PAC-3 units
(Patriot Advanced Capability) were deployed to Kadena
Air Base (Kadena Town, Okinawa City and Chatan Town
in Okinawa Prefecture) and Kadena Ammunition Storage
Area (Yomitan Village, Okinawa City, Kadena Town,
Onna Village and Uruma City in Okinawa Prefecture). In
December 2014, the second AN/TPY-2 radar in Japan was
deployed to the U.S. Kyogamisaki Communication Site
(Kyotango City in Kyoto Prefecture).

See Chapter 1, Section 2-2-1 (Japan’s Comprehensive Air and

Missile Defense Capability)

**(6) Training Relocation**
a. Aviation Training Relocation (ATR)
Based on the decision that U.S. aircraft from three USFJ
facilities and areas-Kadena, Misawa (Misawa City and
Tohoku Town, Aomori Prefecture) and MCAS Iwakuniwould participate for the time being in bilateral training at
SDF facilities, the Aviation Training Relocation (ATR)[16] has
been underway since 2007. The MOD has been improving
its infrastructure, as required, for the training relocation.
The ATR contributes to enhancing interoperability
between the two countries, and also to relocating part
of air-to-ground training conducted by using Kadena
Air Base. Thus, this training relocation will help noise
abatement around Kadena Air Base, thereby contributing
to the mitigation of the impact on Okinawa.


14 A project to relocate the runway of MCAS Iwakuni by approximately 1,000 m to the east (offshore), in response to the requests from Iwakuni City, etc.

15 The radar was deployed to ASDF Shariki Sub Base (in Aomori Prefecture) in June 2006, but was thereafter transferred to the neighboring U.S. Shariki Communication Site.

In addition to assisting the USFJ, the MOD/SDF is
making efforts to conduct training relocation smoothly by
establishment of a liaison office, facilitating communication
with related government agencies, and response to
requirements from the local community so that safety and
security of local communities can be ensured.

that training outside of Okinawa Prefecture, including
mainland Japan, can be increased while maintaining
the deterrence of the Alliance. Based on the above,
both governments have been moving forward with the
training of the MV-22 deployed at MCAS Futenma
outside of Okinawa Prefecture, etc.
In September 2016, it was agreed at the Joint
Committee to relocate the training activities of TiltRotor/Rotary Wing aircraft, such as AH-1, CH53,

**(2) Forms and History of Security Cooperation**
**and Dialogue, and Defense Cooperation and**
**Exchanges**

Defense cooperation and exchanges have been delivered
in the forms of high-level dialogues and exchanges;
bilateral/multilateral training and exercises; capacity
building, in which human resource development and
technical support are provided to other countries in the
fields of security and defense; and defense equipment
and technology cooperation, which is conducted in
order to promote Japan’s security, contribute to peace,
and promote international cooperation.
The MOD/SDF has long strived to alleviate any
feelings of confrontation and tension, and to foster a
collaborative and cooperative atmosphere by building
face-to-face relationships through bilateral dialogues
and exchanges. In addition, the MOD/SDF has
recently enhanced bilateral defense relationships from
traditional exchanges to deeper cooperation in a phased
manner by appropriately combining various means,
including bilateral/multilateral training and exercises,
capacity building, defense equipment and technology
cooperation, and the development of institutional
frameworks such as the Acquisition and Cross-Servicing
Agreements (ACSA).
In addition, multilateral regional security cooperation
and dialogue are in the process of evolving from those
that focus on dialogue to those that focus on cooperation
that seeks to build regional order. It is important to
promote bilateral and multilateral defense cooperation
and exchanges in a multilayered, practical manner in
order to create an ideal security environment.
Due to the spread of COVID-19, the MOD has
continued to utilize telephone conversations and video
teleconferences, as it did the previous year, to deepen
communication with foreign countries and strategically
promote defense cooperation and exchanges even from
the government office in Ichigaya, Tokyo.

**2 Efforts under the Vision of a “Free and**
**Open Indo-Pacific” (FOIP)**

**(1) Characteristics of the Indo-Pacific Region**
Free and open maritime order, which relies on the rule
of law, is the foundation for the stability and prosperity
of the international community. The Indo-Pacific region
is at the core of the world vitality, and home to half
the world’s population. It is important to establish this
region as the free and open global commons to ensure
the peace and prosperity of the entire region.
On the other hand, a range of challenges exist for
upholding and reinforcing Free and Open Indo-Pacific
(FOIP), such as a rapid modernization of military forces
and intensified military activities by some countries in
this region including in Japan’s vicinity.

**(2) Direction of the MOD’s Initiatives**
Given this situation, the MOD/SDF is, for example,
promoting defense cooperation and exchanges to
ensure that Japan can secure the stable use of major sea
lanes. In addition, the MOD/SDF is promoting mutual
understanding and confidence building with countries
that modernize their military forces and intensify their
military activities to prevent contingencies and ensure
Japan’s security. Furthermore, for countries in the
region that are taking steps to respond to changes in the
environment, the MOD/SDF is trying to contribute to
regional peace and stability by supporting their efforts
through defense cooperation and exchanges.

**(3) Areas with Which Japan Will Enhance**
**Cooperation to Uphold and Reinforce FOIP**

With respect to Southeast Asia, South Asia, the Pacific
Island countries, the Middle East, Africa, and Latin
American countries, the MOD/SDF will enhance
cooperation to uphold and reinforce FOIP, utilizing
a wide range of means for defense cooperation and
exchanges, including cooperation and exchange of
personnel, cooperation and exchange of troops, bilateral/
multilateral training, capacity building supports, and
defense equipment and technology cooperation.
Specifically, the MOD/SDF is promoting defense
cooperation and exchanges to help countries in these
regions to play more effective roles in achieving stability
in the Indo-Pacific region, and to secure the stable use
of sea lanes by establishing good relations with these
countries and ensuring that the SDF has stable access to

**Defense cooperation and exchanges**

“Defense cooperation and exchanges” refers to efforts to strengthen bilateral and multilateral defense relations by using various tools, which are significant
initiatives for securing the peace and stability of Japan and the international community.

**Purpose of defense cooperation and exchanges**

〇  To create a security environment desirable for Japan
〇  To deter threats from reaching Japan by making opponents realize that doing harm to Japan would be difficult and consequential
〇  To prevent contingencies through promoting confidence-building and mutual understanding

**Tools for defense cooperation and exchanges**

**Tool 1: Cooperation and exchanges among people**
On such occasions as the “2+2” Meeting, defense ministerial meetings, chief of staff-level meetings or other high-level meetings, working-level consultations among
defense authorities, and multilateral international conferences, participants frankly exchange views on defense policies, regional situations, defense cooperation and
exchanges, etc., thereby developing mutual understanding and building confidence among them and further promoting defense cooperation and exchanges thereafter.
Exchanges of students and interchange in education and research aim to facilitate understanding of defense policies and statuses of military units of other countries and
promote relations of trust through network building.

**Tool 2: Cooperation and exchanges among troops**
The SDF develops mutual trust with partner countries and promotes cooperative relationships through goodwill exercise, mutual visits of naval ships and aircrafts (calling at
ports and airports), and exchange events among units. The SDF will enhance skills of each unit and strengthen the nation-to-nation defense relationships through promoting
cooperative ability with foreign troops in joint training and exercises.

**(4) Countries with Which Japan Works to Uphold**
**and Reinforce FOIP**

Japan’s allies, such as the United States, Australia, and
India, as well as the United Kingdom, France, Germany,
and other European countries, Canada, and New Zealand,
are countries that not only share fundamental values
with Japan, but also have geographic and historical ties
to the Indo-Pacific region.
The MOD/SDF has been encouraging these countries
to become more involved in the Indo-Pacific region. At
the same time, the MOD/SDF has also been promoting
defense cooperation and exchanges with them so that we
can work together as partners when promoting efforts
for upholding and reinforcing FOIP in the areas listed in
(3) above This way we aim to achieve stronger effects


than when promoting efforts on our own.

**(5) Expansion of FOIP**
As Japan promotes defense cooperation and exchanges
based on its vision of FOIP, the United States, Australia,
ASEAN, India, European countries such as the United
Kingdom, France, Germany, Netherlands, and Italy,
as well as EU have their own initiatives and visions in
the Indo-Pacific region, which are consistent with our
vision of FOIP. Japan’s vision of FOIP is inclusive and
the MOD/SDF will continue to promote cooperation
with all countries that endorse it.

**(6) Countries with Which Japan Will Promote**
**Mutual Understanding and Confidence Building**

With regard to China, the MOD/SDF aims to avoid
unforeseen events and ensure Japan’s security by tapping

into defense exchange opportunities and conveying
Japan’s concerns about the increased military activities
and military expansion in Japan’s vicinity to promote
mutual understanding and confidence building.

**(7) Strengthen the Organizational Structure to**
**Promote FOIP**

As efforts related to security cooperation with other
countries have expanded rapidly, a new post for civilian
officials at the level of a division director was established
in the Bureau of Defense Policy in July 2020 to conduct
defense cooperation and exchanges with other countries
under a medium- to long-term sustainable system. The


new position shares duties relating to contributing to
the stability of the security environment in the IndoPacific region,” which were part of the “duties relating
to the fundamentals and coordination of international
exchanges in the field of defense” that had been under
the jurisdiction of the former International Policy
Division of the Bureau.
The MOD decided that it would promote
multifaceted and multi-layered security cooperation
more strategically based on the vision of FOIP under
this strengthened structure.

**MOD’s Efforts for the vision of**
**“Free and Open Indo-Pacific” (FOIP)**

**Background**

〇 In August 2016, then Prime Minister Abe unveiled the “Free and Open Indo-Pacific” concept in his keynote address at TICAD VI in Kenya.
〇 Japan’s fundamental aim is to foster regional stability and prosperity by improving connectivity between Asia and Africa through a free and open Indo-Pacific region.

**Basic concept of the “Free and Open Indo-Pacific” vision**

〇 The Indo-Pacific region is the core of the world’s vitality, and home to half the world’s population. Achieving stable and autonomous development in the region is

essential for global stability and prosperity.
〇 The “Free and Open Indo-Pacific” vision aims to promote free and lively socioeconomic activity throughout the Indo-Pacific region and to achieve prosperity in the
entire region.

**Three pillars of the “Free and Open Indo-Pacific”**

(i) Promotion and establishment of the rule of law, freedom of navigation and free trade
(ii) Pursuit of economic prosperity (e.g. improving connectivity)
(iii) Commitment to peace and stability

**✓✓ Policy in which the Government works as one to promote a “Free and Open Indo-Pacific”**

**Characteristics of the Indo-Pacific Region**

〇 Major sea lanes for Japan pass through the region, and much of the world’s population is concentrated there. In addition, given the remarkable economic growth in

the region, stability in the region is extremely important for the security and prosperity of Japan.
〇 On the other hand, there are various challenges to regional stability, such as the rapid modernization of military forces and increased military activity in the region.
〇 In addition, various countries in the region are taking measures to respond to these rapid changes in the environment.

**Direction of MOD’s Efforts**

〇 Securing the stable use of major sea lanes by way of defense cooperation and exchange activities
〇 Preventing contingencies through confidence building and mutual understanding
〇 Contributing to peace and stability through active engagement in the region, in cooperation with partner countries

**✓ There are many security challenges in the Indo-Pacific region**

〇 The MOD/SDF are bolstering defense cooperation and exchanges with countries and regions of the Indo-Pacific that key sea lanes pass through, such as Southeast

Asian countries, South Asian countries, and Pacific Island countries, as well as with the Middle East, Africa and Latin America, which are important for ensuring
energy security.
〇 In promoting the FOIP, Japan will actively cooperate with countries that share the FOIP vision and have ties to the Indo-Pacific region, including the United States,
Australia, India, Canada, New Zealand, and European countries such as the United Kingdom, France, and Germany.

**✓ The FOIP is an inclusive vision. Any country can cooperate as long as it endorses the concept.**

2007, announced the Japan-Australia Joint Declaration
on Security Cooperation, and such joint declaration
focusing on security with a country other than the United
States was the first case in Japan. Japan and Australia
have also developed the foundation for cooperation
such as the Japan-Australia ACSA[3], the Japan-Australia
Information Security Agreement, and the Agreement
concerning the Transfer of Defence Equipment and
Technology.
In January 2022, the leaders of the two countries
signed the Agreement between Japan and Australia
concerning the facilitation of reciprocal access and
cooperation between the Self-Defense Forces of Japan
and the Australian Defence Force (“Japan-Australia
Reciprocal Access Agreement”[4]), reaffirming that
bilateral security and defense cooperation will be
enhanced further.

**(2) Recent Major Achievements in Defense**
**Cooperation and Exchanges**

In May 2021, Minister of Defense Kishi held a telephone
conversation with Australian Minister for Defence Peter
Dutton, in which they concurred on deepening the special
strategic partnership between Japan and Australia,
maintaining communication between their defense
authorities, and continuing to vigorously promote
defense cooperation and exchanges in order to uphold
and reinforce a FOIP. The two ministers also expressed
strong opposition to any attempts to unilaterally change
the status quo by coercion and any activities that
escalate tensions in the East China Sea and South China
Sea, as well as concerns over China’s Coast Guard Law.
Furthermore, they exchanged views on the situation
in North Korea and reaffirmed their commitment to
closely coordinating toward the complete, verifiable,
and irreversible dismantlement (CVID) of all of North
Korea’s weapons of mass destruction and ballistic
missiles of all ranges.


The two ministers held another telephone
conversation in February 2022, during which Minister
of Defense Kishi extended his gratitude for the extensive
support Australia provided to Japan in implementing
international disaster relief activities in Tonga, including
the receiving of SDF transport aircraft. In addition,
Minister of Defense Kishi expressed appreciation for
the Australian representative’s participation in the
Japan Pacific Islands Defense Dialogue (JPIDD) and
for Australia’s support for Japan’s participation as
an observer to the South Pacific Defence Ministers’
Meeting (SPDMM).[5] Both ministers agreed to further
strengthen cooperation together with regional partners,
including Pacific Island countries, and to work even
harder to uphold and reinforce a Free and Open IndoPacific.
In June 2021, Minister of Defense Kishi, together
with Minister for Foreign Affairs Motegi, held the Ninth
Japan-Australia 2+2 Foreign and Defence Ministerial
Consultations [6] via video teleconference with Minister
for Defence Dutton and Minister for Foreign Affairs
Marise Payne, during which they shared a high-level
strategic vision of regional affairs and expressed strong
determination to further enhance bilateral security and
defense cooperation. In discussions on the East China
Sea and South China Sea, the four ministers unanimously
expressed concerns over China’s Coast Guard Law and
opposition to China’s claims on maritime interests in the
South China Sea that are inconsistent with the United
Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea (UNCLOS).
The ministers also reaffirmed the importance of peace
and stability across the Taiwan Strait and concurred to
encourage the peaceful resolution of cross-Strait issues.
Furthermore, the ministers agreed to deepen operational
cooperation in the areas of security and defense,
including increasing the complexity and sophistication
of bilateral training. The ministers also confirmed that
the SDF is ready to provide protection for the Australian


Official title: Agreement between the Government of Japan and the Government of Australia concerning Reciprocal Provision of Supplies and Services between the Self-Defense Forces of Japan
and the Australian Defence Force.

In addition to the activities this agreement currently applies to, the following activities and situations will also be newly subject to the agreement: (1) Internationally coordinated operations for peace
and security; (2) Situations threatening international peace and security that the international community is collectively addressing; (3) Perilous situations; (4) Armed attack situations, etc.; (5)
Activities in situations threatening survival; (6) Rescue measures for Japanese nationals and others overseas; (7) Counter-piracy activities; (8) Elimination of mines and other dangerous objects;
and (9) Intelligence gathering activities.

A bilateral agreement between the SDF and the ADF facilitating cooperative efforts such as bilateral/multilateral training and disaster relief activities by establishing procedures and clarifying legal
status when the forces of one country visits the territory of the other.

A meeting that brings together defense ministers from countries located in the South Pacific (the seven countries of Tonga, Australia, New Zealand, PNG, Chile, France, and Fiji) to discuss a variety
of security-related issues essential to maintaining peace and stability in the region.

95-2 of the Self-Defense Forces Law, whenever the
appropriate opportunity arises. The SDF provided
protection for the Australian Defence Force for the first
time in November 2021.
In January 2022, Prime Minister Kishida and Prime
Minister Scott Morrison held the Australia-Japan
Leaders’ Meeting via video teleconference, during
which they agreed to further strengthen the relationship
between Japan and Australia under the Special Strategic
Partnership and to further substantiate the two countries’
commitment toward realizing a FOIP. The two leaders
also agreed to issue a new Joint Declaration on Security
Cooperation at the earliest opportunity to serve as a
compass for the two countries’ future long-term efforts
to deepen and broaden the scope of bilateral security
cooperation, reflecting the significant developments in
bilateral security and changes in the regional strategic
environment since the Japan-Australia Joint Declaration
on Security Cooperation was signed in 2007.
Prior to the video teleconference, the two leaders
held a signing ceremony during which they signed
the Japan-Australia Reciprocal Access Agreement.
They welcomed the signing of the agreement, which
will elevate bilateral security and defense cooperation
between the two countries to a new level, and expressed
their expectations for the further development of the
Japan-Australia relationship.
In addition, during the international disaster relief
activities conducted in the Kingdom of Tonga from
January to February 2022, Japan dispatched personnel
to the international coordination office established at the
Australian Defence Force’s Joint Operations Command,
where they conducted various coordination activities
and refueled the landing ship JS Osumi from a Royal
Australian Navy supply ship, further strengthening the
relationship between the two countries.

**(3) Initiatives of Each Service**
a. Joint Staff
In January and February 2022, the Chief of Staff,
Joint Staff held a telephone conversation with General
Angus Campbell, Chief of the Defence Force, during
which they reaffirmed that Japan and Australia would
coordinate closely with each other and work with the
international community to support the victims of the
volcanic eruption in Tonga that occurred in January that
year and that both sides would continue to coordinate


closely to contribute to peace and stability in the IndoPacific region.
b. GSDF
In November 2021, the Chief of Staff, GSDF, held a
meeting with Lieutenant General Rick Burr, Chief of
Army, whom he had officially invited to Japan. They
agreed to build on bilateral and multilateral defense
exchanges, bilateral training, and capacity building in
a more multilayered manner than before in order to
strengthen deterrence and response capabilities and
contribute to peace and stability in the Indo-Pacific
region. The two chiefs also signed a memorandum
of understanding concerning the dispatch of the first
liaison officer from the GSDF to the Australian Army.
c. MSDF
Japan-Australia bilateral training was conducted to
improve tactical capabilities and strengthen cooperation
between two Navies, with destroyer JS Murasame taking
part in the southern waters of Kanto Area in June 2021,
with the Indo-Pacific Deployment 21 (IPD21) units in
northern Australia in September 2021, with destroyer JS
Inazuma in the southern waters of the Shikoku Area in
November 2021, and with destroyer JS Yudachi in the
Bay of Bengal in March 2022.
d. ASDF
To enhance interoperability between Japan and
Australia, in June 2021, the Chief of Staff, ASDF signed
the “Arrangement between the Ministry of Defense of
Japan as Represented by the Japan Air Self-Defense
Force and the Department of Defence of Australia
as Represented by the Royal Australian Air Force
Concerning Air to Air Refueling” with Air Marshal Mel
Hupfeld, Chief of Air Force.

**(1) Significance of Defense Cooperation and**
**Exchanges with ASEAN Member States**

ASEAN countries have high potential as a growth
center, with a population of approximately 670 million
people and continuous high economic growth. In
addition, ASEAN countries are situated in strategically
important areas that occupy key points on Japan’s sea
lanes, and they play an important role in ensuring peace
and prosperity of Japan and the region as a whole.
Given the importance of ASEAN countries, there
is great significance in the MOD/SDF strengthening
defense cooperation and exchanges with each ASEAN
country while supporting efforts to enhance ASEAN
centrality, unity, and resilience as the foundation for
regional cooperation. This will not only contribute to
promoting a FOIP, but also lead to the creation of a
favorable security environment for Japan.
Based on this principle, Japan is promoting
confidence-building and mutual understanding through
high-level and working-level exchanges as well as
cooperation, such as capacity building, bilateral/
multilateral exercises, and defense equipment and
technology cooperation with ASEAN countries. In
addition to bilateral cooperation, Japan also conducts
cooperation within multilateral frameworks such as the
ADMM-Plus and the ASEAN Regional Forum (ARF).
The Vientiane Vision, which Japan announced in 2016
as a guideline for Japan-ASEAN defense cooperation,
was the first transparent overview of priority areas for
the direction of defense cooperation with ASEAN as
a whole. In November 2019, at the 5th ASEAN-Japan
Defense Ministers’ Informal Meeting held in Thailand,
then Defense Minister Kono announced the Vientiane
Vision 2.0, an updated version of the Vientiane Vision,
and ASEAN ministers welcomed it. The MOD will
continue to actively promote such bilateral and
multilateral cooperation going forward

**(1) Significance of Japan-ROK Defense Cooperation**
**and Exchanges**

The cooperation between Japan and ROK is increasingly
important in the security environment surrounding the
two countries which grows in severity and complexity,
including the nuclear and missile issues of North Korea,
requirement to response to large-scale natural disasters,
counterterrorism, counter-piracy, and maritime security.
On the other hand, issues between the defense
authorities of Japan and the ROK are affecting
bilateral defense cooperation and exchange. Examples
include the ROK’s response to the MSDF colors [8] at
an international fleet review ceremony hosted by the
ROK in October 2018, the fire-control radar irradiation
of an MSDF aircraft by a ROK Navy destroyer in
December 2018,[9] military exercises by the ROK Navy
in Japan’s surrounding waters including the one around
Takeshima, and the ROK’s termination notification
of the Japan-ROK General Security of Military
Information Agreement (GSOMIA) (however, the
termination notification was later suspended). Due to
the continued negative response by the ROK defense


(a) MSDF

In April 2021, the Chief of Staff, MSDF held a video
teleconference with Admiral Reza, Chief of Navy,
during which they agreed to further strengthen relations
in various fields in order to realize a FOIP. In that month,
the MSDF Overseas Training Cruise Unit also made
a port call in Port Klang and took part in a goodwill
training with Malaysian Navy. Furthermore, in March
2022, minesweeper tender JS Uraga and minesweeper
ocean JS Hirado of the MSDF IMED21 unit visited the
port of Kota Kinabalu.
(b) ASDF
In July 2021, the Chief of Staff, ASDF held a video
teleconference with General Ackbal, Chief of Air
Force. The chiefs shared the view that any attempt to
unilaterally change the status quo or increase tensions by
force in the region is strictly unacceptable, and agreed
to develop the Air-to-Air relationship. In November
2021, a C-2 transport aircraft of ASDF visited Kuala
Lumpur International Airport and conducted a unit-tounit exchange with the Royal Malaysian Air Force.

In December 2018, Gwanggaeto-daewang, the Great class destroyer of the ROK Navy, directed a fire control-radar at a MSDF patrol aircraft conducting warning and surveillance activities off the
coast of Noto Peninsula (within Japan’s exclusive economic zone). Taking the incident seriously, in January 2019, the MOD published its final statement, compiling objective facts, and has been
urging the Korean side to take recurrence prevention measures. The SDF patrol aircraft was flying while keeping sufficient altitude and distance, and did not fly in a way that could have threatened
the Korean navy vessel. The MOD will expend all possible means to monitor the situation and gather intelligence while fully considering safety. For details, see the MOD website (https://www.mod.

authorities, the MOD/SDF will continue to call on the
ROK to appropriately deal with these issues so as not to
impair the cooperation between Japan and the ROK, and
between Japan, the ROK and the United States.

**(2) Recent Major Achievements in Defense**
**Cooperation and Exchanges**

In November 2019, Defense Minister Kono (then) held
a meeting with Minister of National Defense Jeong
Kyeong-doo (then) on the occasion of the 6th ADMMPlus. Mr. Kono stated that Japan-ROK bilateral relations
as well as the trilateral relations between Japan, the
ROK and the U.S. are extremely significant in the very
severe security environment surrounding Japan and the
ROK although the defense relations between the two
countries have been extremely sour because of various
bilateral issues since 2018. The two Ministers agreed
that the two defense authorities would continue their
communication.

**(3) Japan-U.S.-ROK Cooperative Relationship**
Since Japan, the United States, and the ROK share
common interests pertaining to the peace and stability
of this region, it is important for the three countries
to seize opportunities to promote close cooperation
in addressing various security issues, including those
regarding North Korea.
Japan, the United States, and the ROK have usually
conducted a Trilateral Defense Ministerial Meeting on
the sidelines of the Shangri-La Dialogue. In June 2019,
Defense Minister Iwaya (then), ROK Minister of National
Defense Jeong Kyeong-doo (then), and U.S. Acting
Secretary of Defense Patrick Shanahan (then) convened
the Trilateral Defense Ministerial Meeting. The three
Ministers recognized the international community’s
shared goal of North Korea’s full compliance with its
international obligations in accordance with all relevant
UN Security Council Resolutions, which call for North
Korea’s complete denuclearization in a verifiable and
irreversible manner.
They underscored commitment to cooperation and
coordination with the international community for
fully implementing UN Security Council Resolutions,
including sustained international cooperation to deter,
disrupt, and ultimately eliminate illicit ship-to-ship
transfers by North Korean ships. Regarding regional
security issues, the Ministers reaffirmed that freedom
of navigation and overflight must be ensured and that


all disputes should be resolved in a peaceful manner
in accordance with the principles of international law.
Based on this view, they shared the recognition of
strengthening security cooperation between Japan, the
United States and the ROK.
At the Japan-U.S.-ROK Defense Ministerial Meeting
held by then Defense Minister Kono, ROK Minister
of National Defense Jeong Kyeong-doo, and U.S.
Secretary of Defense Mark Esper on the occasion of the
6th ADMM-Plus in November 2019, the three ministers
committed to further trilateral security cooperation,
including information sharing, high-level policy
consultation, and bilateral/multilateral exercises, based
on the international community’s shared goal, which
calls for North Korea’s complete denuclearization as well
as the abandonment of ballistic missiles in a verifiable
and irreversible manner, North Korea’s full compliance
with its international obligations in accordance with
all relevant UN Security Council Resolutions, and the
importance of a rules-based order.
Furthermore, Mr. Kono held a Japan-U.S.-ROK
Defense Ministers’ telephone conversation in February
2022, in which the three ministers reconfirmed the
importance of the cooperation of the three countries
on security, and coincided in their opinion that the
countries would continue close cooperation to counter
North Korea’s launching ballistic missiles.
At the working level, the three countries have
cooperated with each other while closely sharing
information through such opportunities as DirectorGeneral and Director level meetings and video
teleconferences based on the framework of the JapanU.S.-ROK Defense Trilateral Talks (DTT), as well as
chief-of-staff level meetings.
In October 2021, a Director General-level
teleconference was held between the three countries
of Japan, the U.S., and ROK to discuss the situation in
North Korea including its nuclear and missile programs,
regional security, and strengthening security cooperation
among the three countries. The Japanese side brought up
the importance of the three countries working in close
coordination to achieve the international community’s
common goal of North Korea’s full compliance with
its international obligations in accordance with all
relevant UN Security Council resolutions, which call
for North Korea’s complete denuclearization and the
abandonment of ballistic missiles in a verifiable and
irreversible manner In response to a series of missile

into force in January 2014, leading to the development
of a foundation for defense equipment and technology
cooperation as well as information sharing between
the two countries. At the Japan-U.K. summit meeting
in May that year, the prime ministers of both countries
agreed to hold a Japan-U.K. “2+2” Foreign and Defence
Ministerial Meeting and begin negotiations on the
ACSA in order to enhance bilateral cooperation in the
security field.
In January 2017, the Japan-U.K. ACSA[11] was signed.
After the approval by Japan’s National Diet in April
2017, the ACSA entered into force in August. Relevant
domestic laws were then developed. The effectuation
of the Japan-U.K. ACSA enables the two countries to
implement the mutual provision of supplies and services,
such as water, food, fuel and transportation, between
the SDF and the U.K. Armed Forces through unified
procedures in bilateral exercises and large-scale disaster
relief operations, further facilitating and strengthening
the Japan-U.K. strategic partnership. Furthermore, the
two countries started a formal negotiation for the JapanU.K. Reciprocal Access Agreement in October 2021,
and two ministers welcomed the agreement in principle
in the Japan-U.K. summit meeting in May 2022. They
affirmed that the agreement would further deepen JapanU.K. security and defense cooperation by facilitating
bilateral operations and exercises between the Japan
Self-Defense Forces and U.K. military forces, and
enable the two countries to make a further contribution
to global peace and stability.
The Japan-U.K. Joint Declaration on Security
Cooperation, issued during the Japan-U.K. summit
meeting in August 2017, stipulated that the two countries
agreed to develop an action plan with specific measures
relating to bilateral security cooperation between the
relevant authorities. At the Japan-U.K. summit meeting
in January 2019, the leaders reaffirmed the above
Declaration and reaffirmed that the bilateral relationship
had entered the next phase.

European countries, Canada, and New Zealand share
universal values with Japan and play a central role in
initiatives to address common challenges to global
security, with a primary focus on non-traditional
security areas, such as counter-terrorism and combating
illicit ship-to-ship transfers, as well as international
peace cooperation activities. In this regard, promoting
defense cooperation and exchanges with these countries
provides the foundations for Japan to become actively
involved in dealing with these challenges and this is
important for all of Japan, European countries, Canada,
and New Zealand.

**(1) The United Kingdom**
a. Significance of Defense Cooperation and Exchanges
with the United Kingdom
The United Kingdom, being a major power that has
influence not only in Europe but also in the rest of the
world, has historically maintained close relations with
Japan. On the security front, Japan shares the same
strategic interests as the United Kingdom, as both
countries are important allies of the United States. Given
this relationship, it is extremely important for Japan
to promote cooperation with the United Kingdom by
working together on global issues, such as international
peace cooperation activities, counterterrorism, counterpiracy operations and cybersecurity as well as by
exchanging information on regional situations.
With regard to Japan’s relationship with the United
Kingdom, the Memorandum on Defence Cooperation
was signed in June 2012. Following this, the Agreement
concerning the Transfer of Defence Equipment and
Technology came into effect in July 2013 and the
Japan-U.K. Information Security Agreement entered

ministers shared the recognition that the SDF s bilateral
training with the U.K. Carrier Strike Group and the
strike group’s visits to Japan indicate that the defense
cooperation between Japan and the U.K., standing on
a long history and tradition, has elevated to a “new
level”; that the U.K.’s commitment to realize a FOIP
is robust and irreversible; and that Japan-U.K. defense
cooperation contributes not only to the security of Japan
but also to securing the peace and stability of the IndoPacific region and the international community, while
addressing global challenges.
The two ministers strongly condemned the launching
of ballistic missiles by North Korea as a threat to the
peace and stability of the region that violates UNSC
resolutions, and shared the view that the repeated
launches of ballistic missiles by North Korea thus far is
a serious challenge to the international community as a
whole. The ministers then reaffirmed their commitment
to closely coordinating toward the complete, verifiable,
and irreversible dismantlement (CVID) of all of North
Korea’s weapons of mass destruction and ballistic
missiles of all ranges, including responding to illicit
ship-to-ship transfers.
In September 2021, Jeremy Quin, Minister of State
(Minister for Defence Procurement), visited the MOD
and further deepened the relationship between Japan
and the United Kingdom in terms of defense equipment
and technology cooperation, which had elevated “new
level” through the U.K. Carrier Strike Group’s port
call in Japan and multilateral exercises conducted that
month.
The U.K. Carrier Strike Group led by aircraft carrier
HMS “Queen Elizabeth” made port calls in Japan in
August and September 2021. The U.K. aircraft carrier
HMS Queen Elizabeth called at the U.S. base in
Yokosuka, where Minister of Defense Kishi boarded the
aircraft carrier, held a joint press conference onboard
with the commander of U.K. Carrier Strike Group and
the U.K.’s Ambassador to Japan, and confirmed that
the defense cooperation between Japan and the U.K.,
standing on a long history and tradition, has elevated to
a “new level.”

**(2) France**
a. Significance of Defense Cooperation and Exchanges
with France
France is a major power that has influence not only in
Europe and Africa, but also around the world. It is the
only EU member state that maintains a constant military
presence in the Indo-Pacific region, with territories
across the Indian Ocean and the Pacific Ocean. It also
historically has had a close relationship with Japan and
is positioned as Japan’s special partner.
The first Japan-France “2+2” Foreign and Defense
Ministerial Meeting was held in Paris in January 2014,
followed by the visit of then Minister of the Armed
Forces Le Drian to Japan in July of the same year when
the Statement of Intent to promote defense cooperation
and exchanges was signed. Since then, Japan and France
have held discussions on issues including international
terrorism, maritime security, defense equipment and
technology cooperation, Japan-France ACSA, bilateral
training, cooperation in the space and maritime domains,
and collaboration in capacity building in developing
countries.
Japan-France Agreement on the Security of
Information entered into force in October 2011, JapanFrance Agreement concerning the Transfer of Defense
Equipment and Technology entered into force in
December 2016, and in July 2018, Japan-France ACSA
was signed and entered into force in June 2019 after
approval by Japan’s National Diet in May 2019.


(b) Recent Major Achievements in Defense Cooperation
and Exchanges
In January 2022, the sixth Japan-France “2+2” Meeting
was held for the first time in about three years via a
video teleconference. The four ministers welcomed
the significant strengthening of Japan-France security
and defense cooperation in recent years and shared the
view on continuing to promote bilateral/multilateral
training and exercises as well as defense equipment
and technology cooperation between Japan and France,
reflecting on the previous year’s multilateral exercise
with the GSDF and MSDF during the port call in Japan
by the French training fleet “Jeanne d’Arc” and the
participation of French vessels in response to illegal
ship-to-ship transfers. The four ministers also instructed
the administrative authorities to initiate discussions
on a permanent framework to mutually improve
administrative, policy-related, and legal procedures for
bilateral operations and exercises between the SDF and
the French Armed Forces. In addition, the four ministers
confirmed that Japan and France will further strengthen
involvement of the EU in the Indo-Pacific region
while France holds the Presidency of the EU Council.
Furthermore, the four ministers shared serious concerns
about North Korea’s advancing nuclear and missile
development and the situation in the East and South
China Seas, and shared the view to strongly oppose
attempts to unilaterally change the status quo by force.
They also affirmed the importance of peace and stability
in the Taiwan Strait and shared the view to encourage
the peaceful resolution of cross-Strait issues.

essential factor for the peace and stability of the IndoPacific region. From broad and medium- to long-term
perspectives, it is necessary for both countries to
strive to build and enhance the “Mutually Beneficial
Relationship Based on Common Strategic Interests with
China” in all areas, including security.
In the security field, in order to enhance mutual
understanding and trust, the MOD/SDF will promote
multilayered dialogues and exchanges with China. In
doing so Japan conveys its candid concerns about the

situation in the East China Sea, including the waters
around the Senkaku Islands, and continues to encourage
China to play a responsible and constructive role for
peace and stability in the Indo-Pacific region, comply
with international norms of conduct, and improve
transparency regarding defense policy and military
capability, so as to strongly urge China to dispel concerns
of the international community, including Japan.
Moreover, in order to avoid unexpected situations, Japan
will utilize the Maritime and Aerial Communication
Mechanism between the Defense Authorities of Japan
and China in a manner that contributes to building a
trusting relationship between the two countries.

**(2) Recent Major Achievements in Defense**
**Cooperation and Exchanges**

Japan-China defense exchanges stagnated following the
Japanese Government’s acquisition of ownership of the
three Senkaku Islands (Uotsurijima Island, Kitakojima
Island, and Minamikojima Island) in September 2012,
but have gradually resumed since the latter half of 2014.
In December 2021, Minister of Defense Kishi held a
video teleconference with State Councilor and Defense
Minister Wei Fenghe, the first such teleconference in
about a year. The two ministers exchanged views on
Japan-China relations and regional affairs. Minister
Kishi conveyed Japan’s grave concerns and opposition
to attempts to unilaterally change the status quo by
force while pointing out specific incidents such as
activities by vessels belonging to the Chinese military
and China Coast Guard in the East China Sea, including
the waters surrounding the Senkaku Islands, and urged
self-restraint from China. Minister Kishi also touched
on the situation in Taiwan stating that peace and

stability in the Taiwan Strait are extremely important
not only for Japan’s security, but also for the stability
of the international community, and that Japan will
continue to closely monitor related developments.
Furthermore, regarding issues in the South China Sea,
Minister Kishi conveyed Japan’s strong opposition to
attempts to unilaterally change the status quo by force
and any actions that could escalate tensions, as well as
Japan’s serious concerns about the China Coast Guard
Law that went into effect in February that year. He
also communicated strong concerns about the lack of
transparency in China’s defense spending increases and
the modernization and buildup of its military forces.
Finally, the two ministers reconfirmed the importance of
the prompt establishment of a hotline between Japanese
and Chinese defense authorities in order to improve the
efficacy of the “Maritime and Aerial Communication
Mechanism between Defense Authorities of Japan and
China,” and concurred that the ministers would continue
to exercise strong leadership with the goal of launching
operations by the end of 2022.
In December 2021, the 13th round of Japan-China
high-level consultations on maritime affairs was held,
during which Japan reiterated its position and concerns
regarding issues in the fields of maritime security,
including the East China Sea, and urged China to

talks. From the fourth Joint Working Group Meeting in
January 2015, diplomatic authorities of both countries
joined the negotiations.
After the eighth meeting of the Japan-China HighLevel Consultation on Maritime Affairs in December
2017 and the seventh Joint Working Group Meeting in
April 2018, Japanese and Chinese defense authorities
signed the memorandum on the mechanism[16] in the

June 8, 2018.
The “Maritime and Aerial Communication
Mechanism between the Defense Authorities of Japan
and China” has been developed (1) to promote mutual
understanding and confidence between Japan and
China and to enhance bilateral defense cooperation and
exchange; (2) to avoid unexpected collisions; and (3)
to prevent unforeseen circumstances in the sea and air
from developing into military clashes or political or
diplomatic issues. The mechanism’s main components
include (1) annual and expert meetings between the two
countries’ defense authorities; (2) a hotline between
Japanese and Chinese defense authorities; and (3) on
scene communication measures between vessels and
aircraft of the SDF and the People’s Liberation Army.
Under the mechanism, the first annual and expert
meetings were held between the defense authorities in
December 2018. Most recently, the third annual and
expert meetings were held in March 2021. The MOD/
SDF will continue to communicate with China in order
to clearly convey Japan’s candid concerns, taking into
consideration the current situation of various concerns,
while promoting defense exchanges and fostering
mutual understanding and trust between the Japanese
and Chinese defense authorities, and will respond
calmly and resolutely in order to firmly protect Japan’s
territory, territorial waters, and airspace.

**(1) Significance of Defense Cooperation and**
**Exchange with Russia**

The Government of Japan handles the relationship
with Russia appropriately while emphasizing the
solidarity of the G7 and taking the Ukrainian situation
into account. At the same time, it is also necessary to
maintain the minimum essential contacts with Russia,
as it is one of Japan’s neighbors, in order to avoid
unforeseen circumstances or unnecessary conflicts.
The Russian invasion of Ukraine that took place in
February 2022 clearly undermines the sovereignty and
territorial integrity of Ukraine, is a serious violation of
international law and the Charter of the United Nations,
which forbid the use of force, and is an unacceptable
act. Such unilateral changes to the status quo by force
shake the foundations of the international order and on

**(3) ARF**
Regarding the ARF, in which mainly diplomatic
authorities are engaged, concrete efforts[23] have been
made in recent years for specific initiatives in nontraditional security areas such as disaster relief, maritime
security, and peacekeeping and peace building. The
MOD/SDF has been making active contributions to this
forum.
For example, in the field of disaster relief, the MOD/
SDF has dispatched SDF personnel and aircraft to ARF
Disaster Relief Exercises (ARF-DiREx) conducted
since 2009.

a. ASEAN-Japan Defence Ministers’ Informal Meeting
and Vientiane Vision 2.0
Based on the proposal by then Prime Minister Abe at the
ASEAN-Japan Commemorative Summit in December
2013, the first ASEAN-Japan Defence Ministers’
Informal Meeting took place in Bagan, Myanmar, in
November 2014. This meeting, in which opinions were
exchanged on cooperation in non-traditional security
areas such as humanitarian assistance/disaster relief
(HA/DR) and maritime security, was a breakthrough
opportunity bringing defense ministers from Japan and
the ASEAN countries together for the first time in the
history of nearly 50 years of friendship and cooperation
between Japan and ASEAN. This marked an important
first step towards strengthening defense cooperation in


the future.
In November 2019, at the 5th ASEAN-Japan Defence
Ministers’ Informal Meeting, then Defense Minister
Kono announced an updated version of Japan’s original
initiative Vientiane Vision; “Vientiane Vision 2.0.”
The Vientiane Vision presents an overall picture of
the priority areas of the future direction of ASEAN-wide
defense cooperation in a transparent manner. It retains
the basic framework of the initial Vision, including
its objectives, direction, and means of cooperation,
but introduces three new pillars: firstly, establishing
three principles of Japan-ASEAN cooperation which
are “heart-to-heart cooperation,” “tailored and lasting
cooperation” and “equal and open cooperation;”
secondly, introducing the concept of “resilience” to
clarify the connection between our efforts and ASEAN’s
centrality and unity; and thirdly, pursuing synergies
between the AOIP and Japan’s FOIP.
Furthermore, Minister of Defense Kishi attended
the 6th Japan-ASEAN Defence Minsiters’ Informal
Meeting held online in December 2020, and announced
a new program under “Vientiane Vision 2.0” - the
“ASEAN-Japan Cyber Security Training Program
for Defense Authorities.”[24] ASEAN member state
ministers welcomed the proposal, and expressed their
expectation for the furtherance of practical JapanASEAN defense cooperation in the future. Due to the
impact of COVID-19, the first program was conducted
in an online format in February 2022.
In the field of HA/DR, Japan has conducted the
Japan-ASEAN Invitation Program on HA/DR since
2018. In April 2021, Japan held the Japan-ASEAN
Seminar on Humanitarian Assistance and Disaster
Relief (Online). During the seminar, the defense
authorities of Japan and ASEAN member states shared
their respective experiences related to infectious disease
countermeasures in response to the global spread of
COVID-19, and held group discussions on related
topics.
In addition, in October 2021, the MOD/SDF
conducted the second Professional Airmanship Program
online for air force officers and officials from all
ASEAN member states and the ASEAN Secretariat.
During the program, participants exchanged views on


23 In addition to the Ministers’ meeting at the foreign minister level, the Senior Officials’ Meeting (SOM) and Inter-Sessional Meetings (ISM) are held each year, as well as meetings of the InterSessional Support Group on Confidence Building Measures and Preventive Diplomacy (ISG on CBM/PD) and the ARF Security Policy Conference (ASPC). Moreover, since the Ministers’ meeting in
2002, the ARF Defense Officials’ Dialogues (DOD) has been held ahead of the main meeting.

**(5) Others**
a. International Conferences Hosted by Private
Organizations
International conferences on security include not only
intergovernmental conferences but also meetings
organized by private organizations in which various
people, such as government officials, scholars, and
journalists, participate to discuss medium- to long- term
security issues.
Major international conferences organized by private
bodies include the IISS Asia Security Summit (ShangriLa Dialogue),[25] IISS Regional Security Summit
(Manama Dialogue),[26] organized by the International
Institute for Strategic Studies (IISS), and the Munich
Security Conference,[27] one of the most prestigious
meetings on security in Europe and the United States.
Defense Minister and MOD officials actively participate
in these meetings, holding talks with defense ministers
and other representatives from other countries, while
making speeches at these meetings, in order to build
trust and share mutual recognition with high-level
officials and to send out positive messages.
In November 2019, then Defense Minister Kono
attended the 15th Manama Dialogue. This was the first
time for a Japanese Defense Minister to participate in
the event. At the meeting, he delivered a speech and held
bilateral talks with the French Minister of the Armed
Forces and ministerial-level officials from Jordan,
Bahrain, and Yemen. In this speech, Mr. Kono stated
that Japan continues to contribute to the peace and
stability of Middle East region taking the view that the
open and stable maritime order provides the basis for a
stable and prosperous international community, and that
the Self-Defense Forces is forging broader and closer
ties with this region through contribution to the regional
maritime security by human resources, participation in
trainings, defense equipment cooperation, person-toperson links, and other initiatives. Mr. Kono also stated
that the freedom of navigation and the rule of law at
sea is important, and explained that, in order to ensure
the safety of Japan-related ships and also to secure the


the themes of International Aviation Law and Norms,
Security in the Air, and Humanitarian Assistance and
Disaster Relief to facilitate the sharing of practical and
professional knowledge and perspectives. Regarding the
Japan-ASEAN Ship Rider Cooperation Program that
since 2017 has been conducted on board the destroyer
JS “Izumo,” which is currently engaged in deployment
training for the Indo-Pacific region, has been suspended
since 2020 due to the impact of COVID-19.
Through these initiatives, Japan has worked to
promote capacity building, mutual understanding, and
network building with participants from all ASEAN
member states through seminars and training programs
in various areas, including maritime security and
humanitarian assistance/disaster relief (HA/DR), while
also fostering a shared recognition about international
law, which has contributed to the stability of the IndoPacific region.

in charge of defense policy (Director-General level
officials and general-level officers) from the countries in
the region to discuss defense policies of the participating
countries and confidence-building measures in the field
of defense.
The forum was canceled in 2020 and 2021 due to the
COVID-19 pandemic.


25 This is a multilateral conference sponsored by IISS, a private U.K. think tank, in which defense ministers from various countries participate with the objective of discussing defense-related issues
and regional defense cooperation. It has been held in Singapore every year since 2002 and is known as the Shangri-La Dialogue, named after the hotel where it takes place. The conference was
canceled in 2020 and 2021 due to the COVID-19 pandemic.

26 An international conference hosted by the IISS, where foreign and defense authorities and other stakeholders mainly from Middle Eastern countries exchange views on security issues. It is held

any one country, such as activities that utilize space and
cyberspace and responding to large-scale disasters, in
order to realize a FOIP.

**2 Promoting Practical Multilateral**
**Security Cooperation Initiatives**

**(1) Pacific Partnership**
The Pacific Partnership (PP), which started in 2007,
is an initiative in which naval vessels, primarily those
from the U.S. Navy, visit countries in the Asia-Pacific
region to provide medical care, conduct facility repair
activities, and engage in cultural exchange to strengthen
cooperation between countries participating in the


initiative and facilitate international peace cooperation
activities through cooperation with governments,
military forces, international organizations, and nongovernmental organizations (NGOs) in those countries.
Japan has dispatched SDF medical personnel and units
under the Pacific Partnership since 2007. In 2021,
due to measures taken in response to COVID-19,
the Ground, Maritime, and Air Self-Defense Forces’
bands participated online by creating a music video
that included joint performances with the U.S. Pacific
Fleet Band, the Royal Australian Navy Band, and the
Philippine Navy Seabees Band.

**(2) Multilateral Exercises**
a. Significance of Multilateral Exercises in the IndoPacific Region
In the Indo-Pacific region, the MOD/SDF has actively
participated in multilateral training and exercises in
non-traditional security fields, such as HA/DR and Noncombatant Evacuation Operations (NEO), in addition
to traditional training conducted in preparation for
combat situations. It is important to participate in such
multilateral exercises so as not only to raise the skill
level of the SDF, but also to create a cooperative platform
with relevant countries. In light of this perspective, the
MOD/SDF intends to continue to actively engage in
such training.
b. Initiatives for Multilateral Exercises
The multilateral relationships have recently shifted from
the phrase for building trust to the phrase for developing
more concrete and practical cooperative relationships.
Various multilateral training and exercises have been
actively conducted as important initiatives to effectively
help this shifting.

**1 Significance of Capacity Building**

In today’s security environment, no country can maintain
its peace and stability on its own. It is indispensable
for the international community to unite to resolve
global issues. Capacity building is an initiative to
actively create regional stability and enhance the global
security environment by improving recipient countries’
own capacities through continuous human resource
development and technical support on a steady-sate
basis in fields related to security and defense. The
MOD/SDF have been providing capacity building in the
areas of security and defense since 2012, in response to

capacity for the Djibouti Armed Forces, including
training on how to operate engineering equipment such
as hydraulic shovels, graders, and dozers. From October
to December 2021, 13 SDF personnel were dispatched
to train 24 members of Djibouti’s engineering unit.

MOD has dispatched four officials to the Australian
Department of Defence since 2015.
In November 2017, Japan and Australia held the first
working group on capacity building.
Japan has also cooperated with the United States and
Australia in providing capacity building to Timor-Leste.
The SDF and the U.S. forces participated in the Harii
Hamutuk Exercise sponsored by the Australian forces
in Timor-Leste six times since October 2015, providing
technical guidance on engineering for engineering units
of the Timor-Leste forces.
It is important for Japan and other countries
providing capacity building to conduct such cooperation
effectively and efficiently by closely coordinating with
and mutually complementing each other.


**3 Collaboration with Related Countries**

The MOD also conducts capacity building for third
party countries in collaboration with the United States,
Australia, and other countries.
Firstly, between Japan and the U.S., the joint
statement of the Japan-U.S. “2+2” in April 2015 states
that the two countries would strengthen their continued
close coordination on cooperation including capacity
building to realize peace, stability, and prosperity in the
region. The two ministers agreed to promote defense
cooperation with Southeast Asian countries.
Between Japan and Australia, as part of JapanAustralia cooperation in the area of capacity building,
the MOD has received five officials from the Australian
Department of Defence since 2013. In exchange, the

Task Group 151 (CTG 151), following organizational
restructuring aimed at more efficient unit operations.
As these initiatives by the international community
have proved to be effective, the number of acts of
piracy occurring in the waters off the coast of Somalia
and in the Gulf of Aden has currently hovered at a low
level. However, the assumed root causes of piracy such
as unstable security and poverty in Somalia have still
remained unsolved. In addition, considering the fact
that Somalia’s capability to crack down on piracy is also
still insufficient, the situation could be easily reversed
if the international community reduces its counterpiracy efforts. Therefore, there is no great change in
the situation in which Japan must carry out its counterpiracy operations.

**1 Significance of Counter-Piracy**
**Operations**

Piracy is a grave threat to public safety and order on
the seas. It can not be ignored especially for Japan,
depending on maritime transportation to import most
of the resources and food necessary for its survival and
prosperity as a maritime nation. The Japan Coast Guard
(JCG), one of the law enforcement agencies in Japan, is
primarily responsible for coping with piracy. However,
in cases where it is deemed extremely difficult or
impossible for the JCG to cope with piracy by itself, the
SDF is to take action as well.
For Japan and the international community, the
waters off the coast of Somalia and in the Gulf of Aden
are extremely important sea lanes, connecting Europe
and the Middle East with East Asia. Successive UN
Security Council resolutions[1] were adopted, such as UN
Security Council Resolution 1816, which was adopted
in June 2008 in response to the frequent occurrence of
and rapid increase in piracy incidents with the purpose
of acquiring ransoms by detaining hostages caused by
pirates, who are armed with machine guns and rocket
launchers. These resolutions have requested that
various countries take actions, particularly the dispatch
of warships and military aircraft, to deter piracy in the
waters off the coast of Somalia and in the Gulf of Aden.
To date, approximately 30 countries, including the
United States, have dispatched their warships to the
waters off the coast of Somalia and in the Gulf of Aden.
As part of its counter-piracy initiatives, the EU has been
conducting Operation Atalanta since December 2008,
in addition to the counter-piracy operations conducted
by the Combined Task Force 151 (CTF 151)[2] that was
established in January 2009. Meanwhile, other countries
have been dispatching their assets to the area. In June

operations.
The DSPE strives to ensure the safety of ships

unit also provides information to the MSDF destroyers,
the naval vessels of other countries and civilian vessels,
responding by such means as confirming the safety of
the surrounding area immediately, if requested. The
information gathered by MSDF P-3Cs is constantly
shared with other related organizations, and contributes
significantly to deterring acts of piracy and disarming
vessels suspected as pirate ships.
In order to improve the operational efficiency and

b. Units Deployed at the CTG-151 Headquarters and the
CMF Headquarters
In order to strengthen coordination with the units of
other countries engaged in counter-piracy operations
and enhance the effectiveness of the SDF’s counterpiracy operations, since August 2014, the MOD had
dispatched SDF personnel to the headquarters of CTF
151, the predecessor to CTG 151. During the period
from May to August 2015, the SDF also dispatched a
CTF 151 commander for the first time, while between
March and June 2017, March and June 2018, and
February and June 2020, a CTF 151 commander as well
as staff were also dispatched to the Headquarters.
In June 2021, the Combined Maritime Force (CMF)
and CTF 151 underwent an organizational restructuring
aimed at more efficient unit operations. The SDF
continues to dispatch personnel to the reorganized
CMF and CTG 151, which was reorganized from CTF
151, in order to engage in counter-piracy operations in
cooperation with the international community.
c. Achievements
As of March 31 2022 the DSPE has escorted 4 063


vessels (including 121 vessels escorted based on orders
for Maritime Security Operations). Under the protection
of the SDF destroyers, not a single vessel has come to
any harm from pirates and these vessels have all passed
safely across the Gulf of Aden.
As of March 31, 2022, the DAPE has conducted the
following activities: two P-3C aircraft have flown 2,897
missions with their flying hours totaling 21,030 hours;
and information was provided to vessels navigating
the area and other countries engaging in counterpiracy operations on 15,615 occasions. The activities
conducted by the DAPE account for approximately 90%
of the surveillance operations carried out in the Gulf of
Aden by the international community.

Guten Tag! I was assigned to the Space Operations Squadron

the Space Operations Group in March 2022.) Before that, I had
almost no knowledge of the space domain, but now I am working
on building up knowledge every day through education and work
at my unit, despite being overwhelmed by the level of specialism.
During this time, I was given the opportunity to participate in the

receive a highly specialized education, as well as an extremely
beneficial experience.
Since the universe has no national borders, multilateral
cooperation on top of efforts by individual countries is of vital
importance in creating a reliable space situational awareness
framework. As ways of further solidifying that cooperation, we
were able to deepen our mutual understanding of the space

course and build a community among course participants

with the objective of consolidating peace and security
as well as helping establish necessary conditions
for the development of South Sudan, the UNMISS
was established. Japan was requested by the UN to
cooperate with UNMISS, particularly through the
dispatch of GSDF engineering units. The Cabinet
approved the dispatch of two staff officers (logistics and
database officers) to UNMISS in November 2011, and
in December it decided to dispatch an SDF engineering
unit, Coordination Center, and an additional staff officer
(engineering officer). In addition, the Cabinet approved
the dispatch of one staff officer (air operations officer)
in October 2014. The year 2021 marks the 10th year
since these dispatches started.
South Sudan shares borders with six countries and
is positioned in a highly important location, connecting
the African continent on all four points of the compass.
The peace and stability of South Sudan is not only
essential for the country itself; but also for the peace and
stability in its neighboring countries, and by extension,
Africa as a whole, as well as a crucial issue that should
be dealt with by the international community. Based
on the accumulated experience through past PKO, the
MOD/SDF has contributed to the peace and stability
of South Sudan by dispatching engineering units for
infrastructure development, on which the UN places
great expectations.

See Part I, Chapter 3, Section 10-8 (Situation in South Sudan)

**1 Dispatch to the MFO**

**(1) Significance of Dispatch to the MFO**
In August 1981, the MFO was established by the Protocol
to the Egypt-Israel Peace Treaty as an organization to
undertake the tasks and responsibilities of the UN force
and observer mission stipulated in the treaty. Since 1982,
when its activities started, by facilitating dialogue and
confidence building between Egypt and Israel, the MFO
has contributed to peace and stability in the Middle East,
which is a foundation of peace and prosperity for Japan.
Amidst this, the MFO requested that Japan send staff
officers to its headquarters, and, with a view to making
proactive contributions to international peace efforts, the
Cabinet decided on the implementation of international
peace operations in the Sinai Peninsula in April 2019,
and dispatched two staff officers to the MFO as Japan’s
first activity for the purpose.

See Chapter 1, Section 5-3 (Other Efforts and Activities, etc.)

See


**(2) Activities by Staff Officers and Others**
The two officers are engaging in liaison and coordination
between governments of the two countries or other
relevant organizations and the MFO as a Deputy Chief
of Liaison and an Assistant Liaison Operation Officer
at the MFO Headquarters, which is located in the south
camp at Sharm El-Sheikh in the southern part of the
Sinai Peninsula.
Additionally, in order to help the two officers
dispatched to the MFO carry out activities smoothly and
effectively, one liaison and coordination personnel is
dispatched to Cairo city, Egypt, to liaise and coordinate
with the relevant organizations in the dispatched country.
These activities express Japan’s commitment to more
active involvement in the peace and stability of the
Middle East. It is also expected to promote collaboration
with the other countries dispatching officers, including
the United States, and create new opportunities for
human resource development.

Personnel dispatches to the UNMISS headquarters
are continuing. Four GSDF members (logistics
officer, intelligence officer, engineering officer, and
air operations officer) currently carry out duties at the
UNMISS headquarters. Specifically, the logistics officer
procures and transports goods needed in UNMISS
activities, the database officer collects and compiles
information on security conditions, the engineering
officer plans and proposes UNMISS engineering
activities, and the air operations officer creates flight
plans, etc., for run by UNMISS.
Additionally, a liaison staff member is dispatched to
the liaison office in the Embassy of Japan in South Sudan
to support activities of the Japanese staff officers. These
staff members help interactions between the government
of South Sudan and the International Peace Cooperation
Corps in South Sudan with the aim of ensuring smooth

personnel after the second unit took over, and carried
out activities with great significance, such as repairing
roads and constructing facilities for displaced people
while ensuring the safety of the personnel.
Japan could move on to a new phase regarding
engineering activities in Juba that the SDF was in
charge of. Considering the above-mentioned issues
in a comprehensive manner, in March 2017, the
Government of Japan came to the conclusion that
the SDF engineering unit would withdraw from Juba
around the end of May 2017. SDF personnel engaged
in withdrawal work, then sequentially withdrew from
South Sudan, and terminated the operations by the
engineering unit in UNMISS. At the conclusion of their
activities, the dispatched engineering units repaired a
total of approximately 260 km of roads and developed
a total of approximately 500,000 m2, etc., which are the
largest achievements to date in Japan’s PKO activities.
In response to a request from the UN to transfer
items possessed by the dispatched engineering unit such
as heavy machinery, vehicles, and shipping containers
for residential use, Japan transferred these items to
UNMISS with no charge, intending to make Japan’s
cooperation with UNMISS more effective. Prior to this
transfer of items, the MOD, responding to a request
from UNMISS, provided training on the operation and
maintenance of heavy machinery to UNMISS personnel,
so that UNMISS would be able to conduct activities in a
smooth manner using these heavy machinery and other

In addition, since December 2002, including
personnel currently dispatched, Japan has sent a total
of seven SDF personnel (one director level and six
action officer level) to the UN DPO as well as one SDF
personnel and three administrative officials (all action
officer level) to the UN DOS.

**4 Dispatch of Instructors to PKO Training**
**Centers**

To support PKO undertaken by African and other
countries, the MOD/SDF has dispatched SDF personnel
as instructors to PKO training centers in Africa and
other countries that provide education and training for
UN peacekeepers to contribute to peace and stability by
enhancing the capacity of the centers.


Considering that 30% or more of PKO personnel are
from Asia, Japan decided to implement the program
for the first time in Asia and the surrounding area.
The program provides training on heavy engineering
piloting for engineering personnel. Since a 2018 trial
training, GSDF personnel have been dispatched as
trainers to Vietnamese military garrisons in Hanoi, and
from November to December 2019 they conducted
engineering equipment training for the Vietnamese
engineering personnel at the garrisons. In addition, from
February to March 2020, Training-of-Trainers (ToT)
for engineering equipment was conducted for military
personnel from several Asian countries. From the start
of the program until March 2022, a total of 66 GSDF
personnel were dispatched to Vietnam to provide a total
of three training sessions for 56 personnel from nine
countries in Asia and the surrounding area.
In addition, the UN decided to extend the scope of
support under this program to the field of sanitation,
given that strengthening sanitation capacity to ensure
the safety of deployed personnel has become an issue
in UN peacekeeping operations. In response, the UN
Field Medical Assistant Course (UNFMAC), which
aims to train personnel who can provide first aid before
medics or medical team provide specialized treatment in
areas of PKO operations, was implemented in October
2019. In the course, eight instructors, including two
GSDF officers, trained 29 personnel at the UN Regional
Service Centre Entebbe in Uganda.
Furthermore, in December 2021, as part of the
UNTPP, Japan conducted an online Construction
Process Management Course for engineering personnel
in the Asian region. This course, the first online program
to be conducted by Japan within the framework of the
UNTPP, provided training on construction management
and problem solving methods for UN PKO missions. In
the course, three GSDF personnel served as instructors
and conducted training for 25 military engineers from
Indonesia, Cambodia, and Vietnam.

**6 Revision of the UN Peacekeeping**
**Missions Military Engineer Unit**

In order to play a more leading role in international peace
cooperation activities, the MOD/SDF has served as the
chair of the working group on military engineering since
2013 with the aim of supporting the development of UN

**5 Support to the UNTPP (UN TPP United**
**Nations Triangular Partnership**
**Programme)**

Japan has so far earned unquestionable trust in the
areas of engineering and transport that are essential for
promoting smooth peacekeeping operations. To continue
to support the rapid deployment of peacekeeping
missions and implement high quality activities, Japan
expressed its active support at the PKO Summit in
September 2014, and it was embodied by the UNTPP.
The UNTPP was founded using funds from Japan
as a project to support training for military engineers
and the procurement of heavy equipment by the UN
DOS. Japan has been dispatching SDF personnel to the
International Peace Support Training Centre (IPSTC)
in Nairobi, Kenya, as trainers since the pilot training
in September 2015. From January to March 2022, SDF
personnel were dispatched as trainers to the Kenya
Armed Forces’ Humanitarian Peace Support School
in Nairobi to provide training on heavy machinery
operation and maintenance to engineering personnel
in the African region. From the start of the program to
March 2022, a total of 184 GSDF personnel have been
dispatched to Africa to provide 10 training sessions for a
total of 312 trainees from eight African countries

peacekeeping unit manuals, and has contributed to the
completion of the UN Peacekeeping Mission Military
Engineer Unit Manual.
In 2018, the UN asked Japan to serve as the chair
of the working group again for revision of the manual.
For the MOD/SDF, this was a meaningful opportunity
to make contributions by using the experiences and
capabilities acquired through the past PKO and other
missions. The MOD/SDF decided to serve as the chair
again to handle the revision of the Military Engineer
Unit Manual, and submitted the revised manual to the
UN in July 2019 after holding four expert meetings


to complete the revision process. In addition, for the
revision of the Specialized Training Materials (STM)
for the UN Peacekeeping Mission Military Engineer
Unit Manual, the MOD/SDF held three working group
meetings in total, following the first working group
meeting held via video teleconference in April 2021.
In November 2021, two instructors from the Engineer
School were dispatched to Switzerland to conduct a
trial training and submit the revised draft of the UN
Peacekeeping Mission Military Engineer Unit Manual
STM to the UN.

**Tonga**

On January 15, 2022, the large-scale eruption of an
underwater volcano in Tonga triggered a tsunami and
falling ash, resulting in significant damage.
On January 20, 2022, it was decided that the SDF
would carry out international disaster relief activities in
response to a request for relief made by the government
of the Kingdom of Tonga to Japan.


During this mission, C-130H transport aircraft
made four deliveries to Tonga totaling approximately
17 metric tons of emergency relief supplies, including
drinking water, pressure washers, and canned food.
Meanwhile, the landing ship JS “Osumi,” carrying CH47 helicopters, delivered approximately 210 metric tons
of relief supplies such as drinking water and tools for
removing volcanic ash.
The Minister of Defense issued an order to end the
mission on February 17, 2022, bringing the international
disaster relief activities involving approximately 370
personnel to an end. The fact that Japan was able to carry
out this mission quickly and appropriately in the midst
of the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic while coordinating
closely with partner countries in the Indo-Pacific region,
such as Australia and New Zealand, demonstrated
Japan’s commitment to peace and stability in the region
through action.

GSDF conducted five types of training with a focus on
operational preparations that determine the direction
an operation will later take, improving its mission
performance, readiness, and operational effectiveness
as well as reinforcing its deterrence and response
capabilities: (1) mobilization readiness training in
which each garrison and vice-camp makes the necessary
preparations for defense operations; (2) maneuver
deployment training in which units are maneuvered
and deployed cross-regionally utilizing U.S. military
and commercial transport capabilities in addition to
GSDF, MSDF, and ASDF transport capabilities; (3)
logistics and medical training in which equipment

(4) system communications training in which Signal
units are deployed prior to other units to successively
enhance and expand system communications; and (5)
deployment readiness training in which Light Infantry
regiments are formed composed mainly of SDF Reserve
Personnel.
b. MSDF
MSDF uses a training system that enhances proficiency
in stages, as a specific period that takes account of
the timing of crewmember rotations and naval vessel
inspections and repairs is determined as the cycle,
which is then divided into multiple stages. In the
early stages of training under this system, a transition
occurs to applied unit training in accordance with the
enhancement of the proficiency with naval vessels and
aircraft, which are the basic units of fighting capability,
and collaborative training between naval vessels and
between naval vessels and aircraft is conducted. For
example, the MSDF has been conducting MSDF field
exercises since 1955 in which units nationwide are


mobilized to enhance responsiveness. It is also working
to enhance various tactical skills through mine disposal
training in Iwo To, mine warfare training in Hyuga-nada
Sea, Mutsu Bay and Ise Bay, and bilateral minesweeping
special training with the U.S. in each location.
Furthermore, the SDF is working to enhance various
tactical skills utilizing favorable overseas training
infrastructure with the cooperation of the U.S. Navy by
conducting overseas deployment training in the United
States for destroyers and submarines, in waters around
Guam for minelayers, and for aircraft in the United
States.
c. ASDF
In order to develop the capability of its personnel to
fully utilize cutting-edge technologies, ASDF conducts
unit-specific training of fighter aircraft, air warning and
control, anti-air guided missiles and others, with a focus
on enhancing the professional expertise of the individual
at the initial stages of the training. The aim is to enable
ASDF personnel and equipment such as aircraft to
function together as whole. As proficiency is enhanced,
the ASDF conducts training for coordination procedures
between units, and further conducts comprehensive
training with air transport, rescue, and other units added.
For example, the ASDF conducts the field training
exercise Air Defense Command comprehensive training,
in which all relevant units in Japan are mobilized,
and exercises for each function, as well as PAC-3
maneuver deployment training and overseas flight
training to enhance maneuver deployment capabilities
and responsiveness. It also conducts live-fire training
for Patriot missiles for surface-to-air missile units
that utilizes favorable training infrastructure abroad,
strengthening air defense combat operation capabilities.
Furthermore, it is working to enhance the mission
performance of airlift units by utilizing the Advanced
Airlift Tactics Training Center (AATTC) in the United
States.

locations. It trained a series of Japan-U.S. joint action,
from parachute drops from fixed-wing aircraft and
subsequent landing combat through to ground combat,
intended to strengthen readiness and further enhance the
high level of joint Japan-U.S. operational capabilities for
airborne operations. This training, joined by the GSDF
1st Airborne Brigade and others, was the first time a
joint Japan-U.S. parachute drop flying directly from
Japan to Guam. The joint creation of the operational
plan and other activities have strengthened the GSDF’s
readiness and enhanced the high level of Japan-U.S.
joint operational capabilities for airborne operations.
The training was conducted based on the agreement
reached at the Japan-U.S. Defense Ministerial Meeting
in March 2021 that “it is important to strengthen
readiness through measures such as various high-end
training including Japan-U.S. bilateral exercises.”

[Resolute Dragon (Field Training Exercise with the U.S.
Marines)]
In December 2021, the GSDF Northeastern Army
conducted the field training exercise “Resolute Dragon
21” with the U.S. Marines. The training was the largest
field training with the U.S. Marines in Japan and
utilized numerous maneuver areas, such as the Ojojihara
Maneuver Area and the Yausubetsu Maneuver Area.
It included training for airborne maneuver operations,
firing exercises using AH attack helicopters, and
firepower combat training by surface-to-ship missile
(SSM) and U.S. Marines High Mobility Artillery
Rocket System (HIMARS) units, including antiship combat training, in order to enhance Japan-U.S.
coordination capabilities based on GSDF cross-domain
operations and U.S. Marine Expeditionary Advanced

For example, the MSDF is consistently conducting
bilateral exercises with U.S. carrier strike groups,
constantly enhancing the deterrence and response
capabilities of the Japan-U.S. Alliance and demonstrating
the two countries’ unified commitment


c. ASDF
ASDF is working to strengthen the ability of the JapanU.S. Alliance to deter and counter threats through
bilateral exercises with the U.S. Air Force such as
“Red Flag-Alaska,” the U.S. Air Force Exercise that
the ASDF has been participating in since 1996, and
the bilateral exercise “Cope North,” conducted in
Guam since 1999. In addition, the ASDF is working to
enhance the effectiveness of Japan-U.S. joint response
as well as cross-domain operation capabilities through
air combat training, intercept training, defensive counter
air training, tactical attack training, aerial refueling
training, search and rescue training, and navigation and
formation training with the U.S. Navy and Marines, as
well as other Japan-U.S. bilateral exercises.

[Japan-U.S. Bilateral Exercises]
In December 2021, ASDF F-15 and F-2 fighters
conducted navigation and formation training and other
training with U.S. Air Force B-52 and F-35A fighters in
the airspace above the Sea of Japan, enhancing various
tactical skills and Japan-U.S. joint response capabilities.
In addition to these training sessions, for example,
ASDF U-125A and UH-60J rescue aircraft conducted
search and rescue training with U.S. Air Force CV-22
and MC-130J aircraft in the sea and airspace north of
Miyakojima Island and Ishigakijima Island in November
2021. This makes it possible to save lives anywhere,
including remote island areas, and in turn strengthen the
ability of the Japan-U.S. Alliance to deter and counter
threats.

[Red Flag-Alaska]
In June 2021, the ASDF participated in Red FlagAlaska, a large-scale training organized by the U.S. Air
Force, to improve its units’ tactical skills and Japan-U.S.
joint response capabilities. During the exercise, ASDF
fighters and early warning and control aircraft conducted
a wide range of advanced training and exercises with
the U.S. Air Force in the U.S. state of Alaska, including
defensive counter air training, tactical attack training,
air combat training, and aerial refueling training.

[GSDF Hawk/Chu-SAM Live-Fire Training and ASDF AntiAircraft Unit Live Ammunition Training]
From August through November 2021, GSDF antiaircraft artillery regiments and ASDF anti-aircraft
units conducted live-fire training with surface-to-air
guided missiles at McGregor Range in the U.S. state
of New Mexico. The objective of the training was to
train a series of action from preparation to the actual

firing of surface-to-air guided missiles, in the U.S. to
improve mission capabilities. A characteristic of the
training is that it was the first time GSDF Chu-SAM
units and ASDF Patriot units collaborated to conduct
firing exercises against multiple targets as ASDF Patriot
units and U.S. Army anti-aircraft units also conducted
coordinated firing exercises.

**3 Practical Multilateral Exercises with**
**Third Party Countries**

Each SDF service is actively engaged in not only
bilateral training with the U.S., but also high-level
multilateral exercises with the participation of third party
countries. By conducting training for landing, maritime,
and airborne operations with Australian and European
forces, the SDF is working to enhance its tactical skills
and increasing its coordination and interoperability with
the forces of other countries to strengthen Japan’s ability
to deter and counter threats.

[ARC21 (Japan-U.S.-Australia-France Multilateral
Exercise)]
In May 2021, the GSDF, MSDF, and ASDF seized the
opportunity to conduct the multilateral exercise “ARC
21” with the U.S., Australian and France forces when
the French training squadron “Jeanne d’Arc” was to call
at Sasebo.
It was the first exercise held with the French Army
in Japan. On land, the GSDF Amphibious Rapid
Deployment Brigade and others conducted various
training alongside the French Army and U.S. Marines
at Camp Ainoura and Kirishima Maneuver Area and in
the western waters and airspace of Kyushu, enhancing
tactical skills for amphibious operations, such as
airborne maneuvers and land-based operations, as well
as strengthening cooperation with the participating
countries.


At sea, MSDF surface ships including the Aegis
destroyer JS “Ashigara,” patrol aircraft and submarines
conducted joint air defense training, anti-submarine
training, and landing training together with the USS
“New Orleans” amphibious transport dock and other
vessels, the Australian frigate HMAS “Parramatta,”
the French amphibious assault ship “Tonnerre” and
other ships. During the exercise, ASDF F-2s conducted
training in cooperation with MSDF units.

[Talisman Sabre 21]
GSDF and MSDF participated in the multilateral exercise
“Talisman Sabre 21” led by the U.S. and Australia from
June to August 2021. The GSDF Amphibious Rapid
Deployment Brigade conducted field training with the
U.S. Marines, the Australian Army, and the British Royal
Marines for the first time to improve units’ tactical skills
for amphibious operations and strengthen cooperation
between the four countries.
The MSDF destroyer JS “Makinami” and its onboard
aircraft conducted live-fire exercises, anti-submarine
exercises and maritime operation exercises in the
waters east of Australia with U.S. Navy amphibious
ships, Royal Australian Navy amphibious assault ships,
a Royal Canadian Navy frigate and a Republic of
Korea Navy destroyer, enhancing various tactical skills
and strengthening cooperation with the participating
countries.

[MSDF Field Training Exercise]
In November 2021, the MSDF conducted the FY2021
MSDF exercise (field training exercise) in the sea and
airspace surrounding Japan. The exercise is the MSDF’s
largest field training conducted almost every other
year since the establishment of MSDF. In FY2021,
about 20 vessels including the destroyer JS “Izumo”
of the MSDF and about 40 aircraft participated. In
addition, the exercise brought together ships from five
countries, joined by approximately 10 U.S. Navy ships

Voice from a participant in Cope North 22


VOICE

Lieutenant Colonel KANOU Hiroaki
Executive Officer, Akita Air Rescue Squadron, Flight
Group, Air Rescue Wing (Akita City, Akita Prefecture)

I, as the Commander of the Rescue Aircraft Training Unit,
participated in Cope North 22, which was conducted in Guam,
the United States, for a little more than a month. This training
program consisted of multilateral exercise between Japan, the
United States, and Australia intended to improve units’ tactical
skills and the interoperability between the participating countries
and humanitarian assistance and disaster rescue (HA/DR)
exercise. The Rescue Aircraft Training Unit participated in both
exercises. The rescue aircraft that participated in the exercises
included a U-125A search aircraft and a UH-60J rescue
helicopter, and training for various types of rescue activities was
carried out.
This year in particular, the UH-60J rescue helicopter was
airlifted by a C-2 transport aircraft and participated in overseas
training for the first time. This was realized as the result of great
efforts. The UH-60J rescue helicopter was dismantled and
airlifted by the C-2 transport aircraft. After reaching Guam, the


rescue helicopter was reassembled by the maintenance staff
under the tropical scorching sun.
In Cope North 22, participants from Japan, the United States,
and Australia worked closely together from its planning phase.
They incorporated past lessons and latest information on security
issues into the planning and ensured that the training could be
made more practically and effectively.
In addition, we needed to consider the impacts of the
COVID-19 pandemic. During the HA/DR training, we got an
Australian service member in the UH-60J rescue helicopter as a
mock disaster victim. All the training participants made sure that
they would never let anyone catch the disease.
I sincerely believe that all the participating countries banded
together to make such meticulous efforts and successfully
strengthened their cooperation even more. I will continue to
work seriously on daily training and duties for Japan’s peace
and regional stability and also deepen our cooperation with
various countries by making full use of the few in-person training
opportunities.

The Headquarters of Escort Flotilla 3
(Maizuru City, Kyoto Prefecture)

Group Commander, Rear Admiral IKEUCHI Izuru
I worked aboard the destroyers JS “Kaga,” JS “Murasame,”
and JS “Shiranui” on a large body of water stretching from the
western Pacific Ocean to the western coast of the Indian Ocean
for about three months from August to November 2021 as the
commander of the Indo-Pacific Deployment (IPD21) destroyer
unit. At this time, I carried out bilateral/multilateral exercises and
goodwill training over a total of 21 times with 14 countries.
The objective of IPD21 is to “carry out bilateral/multilateral
exercises and training with the navies, etc. of countries in the
Indo-Pacific region and Europe to improve the tactical skills of the
Maritime Self-Defense Force (MSDF) and enhance cooperation
with the navies, etc. of each country in the realization of a ‘Free
and Open Indo-Pacific (FOIP),’ along with contributing to the


peace and stability of the region, increasing mutual understanding
among the participating countries, and reinforcing relationships
of trust.” IPD21 is the fifth iteration of IPD.
At IPD21, we carried out multilateral exercise with the U.S.
Navy, as well as the navies of several European countries. This
included a fleet whose flagship is the U.K. aircraft carrier HMS
“Queen Elizabeth,” which was deployed in the Indo-pacific region
for the first time. We also conducted goodwill training with Pacific
Island countries, such as Palau and Vanuatu, as an IPD unit for
the first time. As a result of each and every member of crew
understanding the importance of this activity and coming up with
various ingenious ideas to overcome adversity, we were able to
accomplish our mission safely. I am proud that we were able to
contribute to the peace and stability of the Indo-Pacific region
through this deployment.

period. For example, vessels from six countries, Japan,
the U.S., the U.K., the Netherlands, Canada, and New
Zealand, including the British Royal Navy’s aircraft
carrier HMS “Queen Elizabeth,” jointly navigated the
South China Sea, where unilateral attempts to change
the status quo continue.
In addition, the MSDF made its first IPD visit to
the Pacific Island countries in September, where it
conducted goodwill training with the Republic of Palau
and the Republic of Vanuatu. Alongside conducting
search and rescue training in Palau’s vicinity together
with Coast Guard patrol vessels donated by the Nippon
Foundation, the MSDF conducted communication
training with maritime police units around Vanuatu,
promoting mutual understanding with the two countries.
Furthermore, during the multilateral Maritime
Partnership Exercise held between Japan, the U.S.,
Australia, and the U.K. in October, naval vessels and
aircraft from the four countries conducted counter-attack
exercises, air defense exercises and surface gunnery
exercises in the Bay of Bengal to improve the tactical
skills of the MSDF and strengthen cooperation between
the four countries. In November, MSDF units, including
a submarine, conducted anti-submarine training in the
South China Sea together with a U.S. Navy destroyer
and patrol aircraft, which marked the first time that
MSDF submarine conducted anti-submarine training in
the South China Sea.
The IPD is a symbolic initiative that demonstrates the
commitment of the MOD/SDF to realizing a “Free and
Open Indo-Pacific,” and the MOD/SDF will continue
this initiative in close cooperation with countries
concerned.

**(2) The Indo-Pacific and Middle East Deployment**
**(IMED21)**

From December 2021 to April 2022, the MSDF
dispatched the minesweeper tender JS “Uraga” and the
minesweeper JS “Hirado” to the Indo-Pacific and the
Middle East, calling at ports in Brunei, Bangladesh,
Sri Lanka, Bahrain, Cambodia, and Malaysia as they
conducted mine warfare training and others with the
navies of these and other countries. In December, they


conducted a goodwill training with Royal Brunei Navy
the day before the Japan-Brunei Defense Ministerial
Meeting that month, and in 2022, dubbed the “JapanSouthwest Asia Exchange Year,” conducted goodwill
training with Bangladesh, bilateral training with India,
and goodwill training with Sri Lanka that January.
In addition, from January to February, the vessels
participated in the International Maritime Exercise led
by the U.S. that was conducted in the sea and airspace
surrounding Bahrain. On the subsequent return trip to
Japan, the vessels continued to demonstrate our nation’s
commitment to the stability and prosperity of the region
through trainings with the navies, etc. of these countries.

**2 Main Bilateral/Multilateral Training**
**Activities with Indo-Pacific Countries**
**in FY2021**

In FY2021, the MOD/SDF conducted various bilateral
and multilateral training in the Indo-Pacific region.
For example, in addition to participating in the Large
Scale Global Exercise 2021 (LSGE21), the multilateral
training led by the U.S. Indo-Pacific Command, the
MOD/SDF seized the opportunity to proactively
conduct bilateral trainings with the navies of the U.K.,
France, Germany and other European countries as they
dispatched naval vessels to the Indo-Pacific region. In
addition, the MOD/SDF also participated in multilateral
exercises involving Japan, the U.S., India and Australia,
such as Malabar 2021, to strengthen cooperation
between the four countries. These bilateral/multilateral
training conducted in the Indo-Pacific region are
important for realizing a “Free and Open Indo-Pacific,”
and we will continue actively conducting them in order
to strengthen our partnerships with other countries.

**(1) Large-Scale Global Exercise 2021 (LSGE21)**
The Large-Scale Global Exercise 2021 (LSGE21)
was a large-scale training led by the U.S. Indo-Pacific

training was conducted in the sea and airspace between
the Coral Sea and the waters east of the Philippines as a
multilateral training between the three countries.
The latter part of the exercise was joined by the
GSDF Amphibious Rapid Deployment Brigade, the
MSDF destroyers JS “Ise” and JS “Asahi,” ASDF F-15
fighters, a U.S. amphibious assault ship, the British
Royal Navy’s aircraft carrier HMS “Queen Elizabeth”
and a Royal Netherlands Navy frigate, and air operation
training was conducted in the sea and airspace south
of Okinawa as a multilateral training between the four
countries.
In addition to working to improve the SDF’s
tactical skills and strengthen cooperation with the
militaries of participating countries by conducting a
variety of multilateral tactical exercises utilizing such
vast sea space, the SDF has also communicated that
it is collaborating with countries that share Japan’s
fundamental values and strategic interests in realizing a
“Free and Open Indo-Pacific.”

**(2) Pacific Crown 21 (Japan-U.K.-U.S.-Netherlands-**
**Canada Multilateral Exercise)**

The MSDF and ASDF took advantage of the opportunity
when the U.K. Carrier Strike Group, comprised of the
U.K., U.S. and Dutch navies and led by the British
aircraft carrier HMS “Queen Elizabeth,” made a port
call in Japan and conducted a series of multilateral
training exercises entitled “Pacific Crown 21” from
August to September 2021 over a wide ranging area,
from the waters south of Kyushu to the eastern waters of
the Kanto region. The MSDF sent destroyers, including
JS “Izumo,” submarines and P-1 patrol aircraft, while
the ASDF sent F-35As and other fighters as well as
E-767 early warning and control aircraft to participate.
Together with British Royal Navy vessels such as the
aircraft carrier HMS “Queen Elizabeth,” British Royal
Air Force F-35B fighters, a U.S. Navy destroyer,
U.S. Marine F-35B fighters, and vessels from other
participating countries, they conducted counter-attack
exercises, air defense exercises and anti-submarine
exercises to enhance various tactical skills and
strengthen cooperation with the navies and air forces of
participating countries.
In addition to this exercise, the MSDF conducted 10
multilateral exercises with the British aircraft carrier
HMS “Queen Elizabeth,” and ASDF also conducted
the first multilateral exercise between Japan the U K


and the U.S. using fifth-generation fighters. This
series of exercises has embodied the fact that defense
cooperation between the U.K. and Japan has entered
into a new phase, and demonstrated that the U.K.’s
involvement is firm and irreversible and that defense
cooperation between the two countries contributes not
only to the security of our nation but also to ensuring
peace and stability in the Indo-Pacific region and for the
international community.

Personnel management of uniformed SDF personnel
differs from that of general civilian government
employees,[1] due to the uniqueness of their duties and the
need to maintain the SDF’s strength. With consideration
given to the knowledge, experience, physical strength
and other factors necessary for the duties of the
respective ranks, the SDF has “Early Retirement
System” where the majority of personnel retire in their
mid-50s and “Fixed Term System” where one term is
two or three years.
After employment, uniformed SDF personnel are
assigned their branch of service and duties at units
all around Japan, in accordance with their choice or
aptitude, following basic education and training at
respective training units or schools of respective SDF
services.


work experience in private companies.
Moreover, a review of the examination for candidates
for uniformed SDF personnel was conducted in 2020
in order to ensure improvement of the quality of
the uniformed SDF personnel in fixed-term system
(candidate for uniformed SDF personnel) while
securing human resources with diverse backgrounds
and capabilities.

Notes: 1. Staff candidates for the medicine, dentistry, and pharmacy faculties will be promoted to the position of First Lieutenant if they pass the national examinations in medicine and complete the prescribed

education and training.

2. General candidate for enlistment (upper) refers to a candidate who has been enlisted with the premise that he/she will be promoted to a fixed-term position of “Enlisted (upper).” Until FY2006, there
were two programs consisting of “Student candidates for enlistment (upper)” and “Enlisted (upper) candidates.” However, these two programs were reorganized and combined, and since FY2007,
candidates have been appointed as “General candidates for enlistment (upper).”

3. As for the candidate for uniformed SDF personnel, in order to enhance the initial education of SDF personnel in fixed-term service, in July 2010, it was decided that their status during the first three

months of their enlistment would be as non-SDF personnel, and they would engage exclusively in fundamental education and training as non-regular Ministry of Defense personnel.

4. GSDF High Technical School trains people to be SDF personnel who will be capable not only of operating and making full use of equipment in the GSDF but also of conducting missions in the international
community. Starting from FY2010 appointments, the status of the school’s students was changed from SDF officer to “students,” which is a new non-regular status. New students receive a high school
diploma at the conclusion of a student course (three years) through distance learning. From the FY2011 appointments, a new recommendation system was introduced in which those who are considered
appropriate to be a GSDF High Technical School student are selected from among the candidates based on the recommendation of the principal of their junior high school etc., in addition to the
conventional general examination.

5. A three-year program ended in FY2013. A new four-year program was established at the Division of Nursing, National Defense Medical College, in FY2014.
6. For Aviation Cadets, the Maritime Self-Defense Force selects from persons 18 or above and under 23 in age and the Air Defense Force 18 or above and under 21 in age.
7. For students on loans, the SDF lends school expenses (54,000 yen per month) to students who major in medicine, dentistry, or science and engineering at a university or a graduate school (excluding
professional graduate schools) and have an intention to continue serving as SDF personnel after graduation (completion) by taking advantage of academic knowledge in their specialized fields.


**(2) SDF Reserve Personnel, SDF Ready Reserve**
**Personnel, and Candidates for SDF Reserve**
**Personnel**

It is essential to secure the required number of
uniformed SDF personnel promptly depending on
situational changes in the event of a crisis. To secure the
required number promptly and systematically, the MOD
maintains the following three systems: the SDF Reserve
Personnel system, the SDF Ready Reserve Personnel
system, and the Candidates for SDF Reserve Personnel
system.[2]

See Fig. IV-2-1-3 (Overview of Systems Related to SDF Reserve

See

Personnel)

SDF Reserve Personnel become uniformed SDF


personnel upon the issuance of a defense call-up order
or other orders, and carry out logistical support and base
guard duties. SDF Ready Reserve Personnel become
uniformed SDF personnel and are assigned to carry
out their mission together with incumbent uniformed
SDF personnel as part of frontline units following the
issuance of a defense call-up order or other orders.
Candidates for SDF Reserve Personnel, some of whom
are recruited among those with no prior experience
as uniformed SDF personnel, are appointed as SDF
Reserve Personnel after completing the necessary
education and training.
As SDF Reserve Personnel and others work in
their civilian jobs under normal circumstances, they

need to adjust their work schedule to participate in
periodic training exercises. Therefore, understanding
and cooperation from the companies that employ these
personnel are essential.
For this purpose, the MOD provides a special subsidy
to the companies that employ SDF Ready Reserve
Personnel and take necessary measures to allow such
employees to attend training sessions for 30 days a
year by taking into consideration the burden on such


companies.
Also, in 2017, the MOD established a framework that
allows the MOD/SDF to provide such information as
the scheduled term of a training call-up and scheduled
term during which SDF Reserve Personnel/SDF
Ready Reserve Personnel are called up to perform
actual operations and are appointed as uniformed SDF
personnel, when requested by their employers. In 2018,
the MOD established a system to provide a subsidy


**Chapter**

-----

which aims to contribute to securing understanding
and cooperation from the employers regarding the
duties of SDF Reserve Personnel. Under the system,
the employers are provided with a subsidy if (1) SDF
Reserve Personnel or SDF Ready Reserve Personnel
respond to a defense operation call-up order, civil
protection dispatch call-up order, or disaster relief callup order, etc. or (2) if they have no choice but to leave
their regular occupations due to injuries during their
duties, etc.
In addition, a special subsidy to the companies
that cooperate with training of SDF Ready Reserve
Personnel was established in 2020. The subsidy is paid
to companies that employ people who, after being a
Candidate for SDF Reserve Personnel with no prior
experience as uniformed SDF personnel, are appointed
as SDF Ready Reserve Personnel after completing
the necessary education and training, and that take
necessary measures to allow such employees to attend
training sessions.
SDF Ready Reserve Personnel were called up at
the time of the July 2018 Heavy Rain[3] and the 2018
Hokkaido Eastern Iburi Earthquake.[4] In 2019, during
the East Japan Typhoon (Typhoon Hagibis)[5] and the
2020 July Heavy Rain,[6] both SDF Ready Reserve
Personnel and SDF Reserve Personnel were called
up. In those cases, they carried out activities including
transportation of goods and livelihood support to the
affected people. Moreover, in 2020, in a disaster relief
mission to prevent infection of the novel coronavirus
disease (COVID19) from spreading, SDF Reserve
Personnel with medical qualification were called up and
carried out their missions, including medical support.[7]

The MOD has been implementing various measures
to increase and enhance SDF Reserve Personnel and
others because SDF Reserve Personnel are anticipated
to be called up more often in response to earthquake


and other disasters. Specifically, recruitment and
appointment were expanded in 2018 to secure a wide
variety of human resources from a broader range. The
upper age limit for recruitment of leading privates and
lower SDF Reserve Personnel was raised from “under
37” to “under 55” and the upper age limit for their
continued appointment from “under 61” to “under 62.”
An upper age limit is not set for persons with a license
for a medical practitioner. Their continued appointment
is approved when it is confirmed that they properly
maintain their medical techniques and that there is no
problem with their duties as SDF Reserve Personnel.
The upper age limit for recruitment of leading privates
and lower SDF Ready Reserve Personnel was raised
from “under 32” to “under 50.” In 2019 a new system
was established to appoint SDF Reserve Personnel
without experience in the SDF as SDF Ready Reserve
Personnel after completing the necessary education and
training.
Also, the MOD promotes the use of SDF Reserve
Personnel in a wide range of fields, such as the
appointment of retired SDF pilots, who were reemployed
in the private sector through the re-employment system,
as SDF Reserve Personnel.[8]

**(3) Administrative Officials, Technical and**
**Engineering Officials, Instructors, and Other**
**Civilian Personnel**

There are approximately 21,000 civilian personnel

-  administrative officials, technical and engineering
officials, instructors, and others - in addition to uniformed
SDF personnel in the MOD/SDF.[9] Civilian personnel
are mainly recruited from those who have passed the
Recruitment Examination for Comprehensive and
General Service National Public Employees conducted
by the National Personnel Authority (NPA), and those
who have passed the Recruitment Examination for


In response to the July 2018 Heavy Rain, approximately 310 SDF Ready Reserve Personnel were called up. From July 12 to 30, they engaged in activities including removal of disaster waste and
livelihood support to the affected people.

In response to the 2018 Hokkaido Eastern Iburi Earthquake, approximately 250 SDF Ready Reserve Personnel were called up. From September 8 to 23, they engaged in activities including
livelihood support to the affected people.

In response to the 2019 East Japan Typhoon (Typhoon Hagibis), approximately 410 SDF Ready Reserve Personnel and SDF Reserve Personnel were called up. From October 15 to November 8,
they engaged in activities including removal of disaster waste and livelihood support to the affected people.

In response to the 2020 July Heavy Rain, approximately 350 SDF Ready Reserve Personnel and SDF Reserve Personnel qualified as nurses were called up. From July 7 to 19, they engaged in
activities including removal of disaster waste and medical support.

In a disaster relief mission against COVID-19 in 2020, 10 SDF Reserve Personnel with a medical qualification were called up and engaged in activities including medical support from February
18 to March 12.

The reemployment system for SDF pilots aims to prevent the outflow of active young SDF pilots to civil aviation companies in an unregulated manner. This system is also designed to utilize SDF
pilots over a certain age as pilots of commercial airlines, and is also significant from the perspective of the development of the airline industry in Japan as a whole.

Among the employees of the MOD, special national government employees are called “SDF personnel,” including administrative officials, technical and engineering officials, instructors, and others,

in order to secure their livelihoods.
Since supporting re-employment is the responsibility
of the Japanese Government (the MOD) as the employer,
and is crucial both for resolving any concerns that
uniformed SDF personnel may have about their future
as well as for securing qualified human resources, the
MOD conducts support measures such as occupational
training useful for their re-employment.
In addition, as the MOD does not have the authority
to provide them with employment placement, the
Foundation for the SDF Personnel Support Association
provides free job consultation services for retired
SDF personnel with permission from the Minister of
Health, Labor and Welfare and the Minister of Land,
Infrastructure, Transport and Tourism.
Retired uniformed SDF personnel have
excellent abilities in planning, leadership, faculty,
cooperativeness, and responsibility gained through their
work performance, education and training. Furthermore,
they have various qualifications and licenses acquired
through their duties and vocational training. Therefore,
they are making positive contributions in a broad
range of sectors, including manufacturing and service
industries, as well as finance, insurance, real estate,
and construction industries, in addition to the areas
of disaster prevention and risk management at local
governments.
Based on the NDPG and MTDP, the MOD/SDF will
strive to further improve re-employment support by
expanding vocational training subjects and support for
step-by-step acquisition of qualifications before their
retirement. The MOD also strives to further utilize
retired SDF personnel while strengthening collaboration
with local governments and related organizations from
the perspective of utilizing the knowledge, skills, and
experience of retired SDF personnel.
Specifically, as of the end of March 2022, a total of
601 retired SDF personnel work as crisis management
officers and others at local governments’ disaster
prevention bureaus — 45 prefectural bureaus have
104 of them in total, and 426 municipal bureaus have
497. As this strengthens collaboration between the
MOD/SDF and local governments and enhances local
governments’ crisis management capabilities, including
disaster prevention, the MOD/SDF will continue active
support for the utilization of retired SDF personnel

**2 Improvement of Living and Work**
**Environment and Treatment**

To enable all SDF personnel to maintain high morale
and continue to fully exercise their ability, the NDPG
and the MTDP state that the MOD/SDF will improve
living and work environment. Specifically, to ensure
readiness, the SDF will accelerate its acquisition and
renewal of the necessary barracks and housing, and
also promote measures for deteriorated and earthquakeresistant facilities. Additionally, it will steadily renew
worn-out living-related and work equipment, and secure
the requisite amount of daily consumables.
Because SDF personnel carry out their missions
under a severe environment, the SDF will improve
their treatment based on the special nature of their
missions and work environment. Specifically, in order
to ensure appropriate treatment in accordance with the
risk and other particularities of their missions and the
characteristics of the area of the office, the SDF will
make improvements to special work allowance,[10] etc.,
and to enable SDF personnel to fulfill their missions
with high morale and pride, the MOD/SDF will
improve their treatment through measures concerning
honors and privileges, including the enhancement
of the defensive meritorious badges to appropriately
acknowledge their achievements. In light of the severe
recruitment environment, the Act on Remuneration, etc.
of Ministry of Defense Personnel was revised in 2019 to
raise salaries with a focus on starting pay.

I completed my term of service as a Maritime Self-Defense Force

order, but I must work applying my own judgment to my boss’s
instructions on merchant ships. In addition, I make it a rule to
actively do what I can of my boss’s jobs to further broaden the
scope of my work.
The company where I work provides me with a severe but
homey working environment and enables me to feel how
wonderful it is to work aboard merchant ships. Currently, I work
hard so that my boss will tell me as soon as possible, “You’ve
gotten used to working on merchant ships.” I want to grow to
be a sailor who can convey the appeal of merchant ships as an
ex-MSDF personnel.

Mr. MIYAMOTO Masafumi, Maritime Affairs Division Chief.
Since 2015, our company has participated in corporate
explanatory meetings for SDF personnel to be retired and has
explained some of our work using our operational communications
when interviewing them.
Shortly after joining the company, some retired SDF personnel
are confused by the difference between working aboard SDF
vessels and our merchant ships. To relieve their confusion, we
arrange for them to get on board ships where senior retired
SDF personnel are aboard as much as possible as part of an
instruction and training program through which retired SDF
personnel can acquire basic work skills on merchant ships
from their seniors. This training system has enabled retired SDF
personnel to develop their skills significantly by competing with
each other, and currently, all the seven retired SDF personnel of
our company work as foremen.
Our company demands each employee to pay best attention
to safe navigation, and it provides a considerate workplace where
retired SDF personnel can perform well.

The Tokyo Prefectural Deputy Director General for Crisis

Tokyo has a population of about 14 million people and comprises

62 municipalities including Izu and Ogasawara Islands. In addition,
Tokyo is the political and economic center of Japan, and as such,
Tokyo’s crisis management is connected directly with the crisis
management of Japan. With a combined force of about 190
people, the Disaster Prevention Division of the Bureau of General
Affairs takes sole responsibility for Tokyo’s crisis management.
The Deputy Director General for Crisis Management assists the
Director General of the Bureau of General Affairs in disaster and
crisis management, with the post set up for the arrangement
of such matters. At present, the division is working on a wide
range of projects for the enhancement of measures to protect the
nation, including a review of damage estimates resulting from
earthquakes and other natural disasters hitting Tokyo directly as
a basis for creating a resilient city in the face of disaster; efforts
to create plans for various types of disasters and strengthening
regional disaster preparedness; measures in cooperation with


business operators for cases of stranded persons who are unable
to return home; and the promotion of digital transformation for
disaster prevention, such as the digitization of Victim’s Certificates
and creating flood damage simulations using digital twins. The
functions of the Deputy Director General for Crisis Management
are extensive and wide-ranging, and in addition to the above,
include responding at times of earthquakes, storm and flood
damage, and other disasters, conducting various types of training,
and coordinating measures relating to COVID-19. Furthermore, I
am also strengthening ties with local government municipalities,
as well as the Tokyo Metropolitan Police Department and Tokyo
Fire Department, Japan Coast Guard, and the Self-Defense
Forces (the SDF), which are all essential for crisis management.
In carrying out these wide-reaching functions, the knowledge,
experience, and way of thinking I have developed thus far as a
member of the SDF, in addition to vitality and physical strength,
have been essential. My aim is to make Tokyo the world’s safest
city together with each member of staff at the Disaster Prevention
Division.

Meanwhile, with regard to the re-employment of
SDF personnel, new regulations about re-employment
were introduced in October 2015, replacing the former
prior approval system. As are the cases in other national
government employees, the following three regulations
were put in place in order to ensure the trust of the public
regarding the fairness of official duties: (1) regulation on
requesting re-employment of other personnel and retired
personnel and requesting information; (2) regulation
on seeking employment opportunities at companies in
which retired personnel had a stake whilst in office;
and (3) regulation on reemployed personnel making
requests.[11] In order to ensure strict observation of these
regulations, bodies comprised of academic experts with
no history serving as SDF members (Defense Personnel
Review Board’s Separate Meeting for Monitoring
Reemployment and Cabinet Office’s Re-employment
Surveillance Commission) monitor the situation, and
any violation will be met with penalties.
Additionally, for the purpose of appropriate
implementation of unified management and disclosure
of reemployment information by institutionalizing
notification and announcement of such information
by the Cabinet, it has been decided that information
on the re-employment status of retired SDF personnel
who were in managerial positions (equivalent to the
position of Senior Coordinator in the MOD or higher)
is to be published every fiscal year by the Cabinet. Most
recently, notifications of reemployment of the retired
SDF personnel who were in managerial positions
submitted during FY2020 were compiled, and a total of
170 cases were officially announced in September 2021.

**4 Initiatives to Support Families**

In addition to exchanges between units and personnel’s
families, as well as between the families, the MOD
in cooperation with relevant external groups and
organizations is also actively working to develop a
family support system to be implemented in the event
of large-scale natural disasters and other events, which
will include receiving cooperation in confirming the
safety of the family members of SDF personnel.
In addition, from the viewpoint of being able to
maintain a response posture over the long-term, the
MOD is promoting various types of family support


Briefing session for families of SDF personnel dispatched overseas (November 2021)

measures in the MTDP in consideration of the families
of SDF personnel. For units dispatched overseas or
to vessels for operations expected to continue for an
extended period of time, the MOD has been creating a
communication environment that allows personnel and
their families to get in direct contact. Moreover, for units
dispatched overseas, the MOD has been implementing a
range of support measures for the families of personnel,
including supporting additional shipments of comfort
items sent from families to SDF personnel on dispatch,
holding briefing sessions and establishing consultation
desks (family support centers) for families, and creating
a website for the families of SDF personnel.

**5 Initiatives to Maintain Rigorous**
**Discipline**

The MOD/SDF has gained greater expectations from
Japanese people in recent years, and it is indispensable
for us to gain their support and trust all the time to fully
exercise our ability to complete our duties. In order to
meet their expectations to this end, the SDF personnel
are required to be an invariably disciplined existence
more than ever.
The MOD/SDF has so far strived to foster welldisciplined personnel by impressing in them an
awareness of compliance with the law through setting
up periodic campaigns, such as the “MOD Anti-Drug
Abuse Month,” “SDF Personnel Ethics Month,” and
“MOD Personnel Harassment Prevention Week,” and
taking various effective measures such as thorough
instructions on service discipline.
The core element of defense capability is SDF
personnel; in order to exert organizational strength and
respond decisively to a wide range of situations, the

subordinates, and other issues. In order to resolve and
prevent these issues, the SDF provides (1) the classroom
training and remote learning to enhance understanding
and raise awareness of power harassment among SDF
personnel, (2) the education to promote understanding
including soft skills, and to enhance leadership
capabilities among SDF personnel (particularly those in
managerial positions), and (3) the measures to improve
and reinforce the consultation system.
For the purpose of eradicating disciplinary violations
such as assault, injury, and workplace harassment, the
standards of disciplinary actions have been tightened
since March 2020, and the SDF has taken a zerotolerance approach since then.
Furthermore, as some personnel who have concerns
regarding harassment find it difficult to seek advice or
be resolved internally, there has been a consultation
service staffed by lawyers, in addition to that a
consultation service staffed by mental health counselors
and others from outside of SDF will be open to consult
on weekends holidays and after hours from FY2022


SDF must create a working environment that enables
SDF personnel to perform their tasks confidently with
high morale and sense of security.
Power harassment, abuse of power in the workplace,
is a major problem; such harassment could lead to

**6 Initiatives to Prevent Suicide among**
**SDF Personnel**

More than 100 SDF personnel died by suicide annually
during the period between FY2004 and FY2006.
Although the number has gradually declined since
FY2007, to 58 in FY2021, the loss still continues, with
about 60 SDF personnel taking their own precious lives.
That fact is truly a tragic loss for the families of the
deceased, as well as a huge loss to the SDF.

Since FY2021, measures have being implemented to
prepare for the period of July through September, when
the number of suicide incidents tends to increase, with
the mental health awareness campaign months of June
and July set forth and promoted in order to suppress the
number of incidents.
Furthermore, in September 2021, Minister of Defense
and Parliamentary Vice-Minister of Defense put out
video messages to personnel describing their thoughts
on counseling after experiencing it themselves in an aim
to break the psychological barrier toward undergoing
counseling among personnel, from the perspective of
preventing suicide.

duty, conducted with the participation of Prime Minister Kishida

in 1950 and through its evolution via the National Safety
Force and the Coastal Safety Force into the SDF today,
SDF personnel have been striving to accomplish the
noble mission of protecting the peace and independence
of Japan. They have been devoting themselves
unstintingly to training, day and night, to live up to the
expectations and trust of Japanese citizens, regardless of
danger, and with a strong sense of responsibility. During
this time period, however, more than 2,000 personnel
have lost their lives in the line of duty.
In the MOD/SDF, funeral ceremonies in order to
express condolences are carried out by each unit to
which the personnel who perished in the line of duty
belonged. Moreover, in order to eternally recognize the
achievements of the SDF personnel who perished in the
line of duty, and to express deep honor and condolences,
memorial ceremonies are carried out in various forms,
such as the Memorial Service for members of the
SDF personnel who lost their lives in the line of duty
conducted with the participation of the Prime Minister.
Achievements of 18 SDF members (12 GSDF, 3 MSDF,
and 2 ASDF members, and one member of another
organization) who lost their lives in the line of duty
were recognized in a Memorial Service in FY2021.[12]


12 The Monument for SDF Personnel who Perished in the Line of Duty was constructed in 1962 in Ichigaya. In 1998, the Memorial Zone in its current form was completed by combining this
monument with other monuments located in the same area. The MOD holds an annual memorial ceremony for SDF personnel who perished in the line of duty, led by the Minister of Defense
and with the attendance of surviving family members and the Prime Minister. At the Monument for SDF Personnel who Perished in the Line of Duty in the Memorial Zone, there is an iron plate
containing the names and other information of personnel who perished in the line of duty. When foreign dignitaries such as Defense Ministers visit the MOD, they make offerings of flowers,

The North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) cooperates with
international organizations such as the United Nations (UN) and
the European Union (EU) to contribute to maintaining international
peace and stability. I have been assigned to the Cooperative
Security Department—a first for a member of the SDF—and
am engaged in operations relating to coordinating cooperation
between NATO and other international organizations, as well as
formulating and implementing various plans.
I think that in order to work side by side with staff from member
countries, it is important to share a common understanding and
have a wide understanding of NATO’s mission, its organizational
structure and decision-making methods, the broader situation
involving NATO at present, the ways of thinking of each member
country, and other matters. I will do my best to ensure that my
work at NATO goes toward helping strengthen future cooperation
between Japan and NATO.

to have multifaceted capabilities including higher levels
of knowledge, decision-making ability, and skills. In
addition, under a severe recruitment environment due
to the declining birthrate and continuing trend of higher
education, it is anticipated that the number of SDF
personnel with time and location restraints, including
those involved in childcare, nursing care, and other
responsibilities, will significantly increase.
In light of these changes, the SDF is required to evolve
from a conventional organization with an emphasis on
homogeneity among the members, into an organization
that is capable of incorporating diverse human resources
in a flexible manner.
At present, the largest human resource that the
SDF has not been able to fully utilize is women,
who account for half of the population targeted for
recruitment. Promoting the active engagement of female
SDF personnel has the following significance: (1)
securing useful human resources; (2) utilizing diverse
perspectives; and (3) reflecting values of the nation.
For this reason, the MOD/SDF has decided to open up
a path for female personnel with motivation, ability,
and aptitude to have opportunities to demonstrate their
abilities in various fields, and aim for doubling the ratio
of female SDF personnel.
In terms of employing and promoting female
SDF personnel, the MOD/SDF sets out a personnel
management policy to ensure equal opportunity
between men and women and assign the right person
to the right place based on the person’s motivation and
ability/ aptitude.


**2 Removal of the Assignment Restriction**
**of Female SDF Personnel**

The MOD/SDF has been reviewing the restriction of
assignment of female personnel. With the removal of
the restriction on female assignments in submarines
in December 2018, the restriction against females was
completely removed with the exception of the units
where female personnel cannot be assigned for reasons
of maternity protection (a part of the GSDF Nuclear
Biological Chemical (NBC) Weapon Defense Unit

[chemical] and Tunnel Company Units).
With the removal of the restriction on female
assignments, the first female fighter pilot and the first
female paratrooper went on duty in 2018 and March
2020 respectively. Moreover, female SDF personnel
began serving onboard submarines in October 2020.

With regard to recruitment, in line with the overall

ensuring that women account for over 35% of recruits
in and after FY2021. Regarding promotion, as a goal
to be achieved by the end of FY2025, the proportion of

infectious diseases, improve equipment to transport
infectious disease patients and develop readiness for
offering medical treatment to patients affected by Type
I infectious diseases which are classified as the most
dangerous category among known infectious diseases.
The SDF Central Hospital and the NDMC Hospital were
designated as a medical institution for Type I infectious
diseases in April 2017 and March 2019 respectively and
have been working to improve capabilities to deal with
infectious diseases.
For the future, the MOD/SDF will develop systems
necessary for various international cooperation
initiatives, which include the upgrading of mobile
medical systems that are effective for overseas medical
activities and dispatch of SDF personnel to the medical
departments of international organizations, the U.S.
DoD and others.
In addition, the law was amended in 2022 in order
to allow the SDF to provide foreign armed forces with
medicines that are classified as narcotics or psychotropic
substances. This has enabled the SDF to rapidly provide
medications needed to save the lives of the injured, such
as analgesic drugs and sedatives.

superiority, inventing as well as delivering advanced
equipment in an effective and efficient manner, and
dealing with various policy issues pertaining to defense
and civilian technologies, taking account of the National
Security Strategy, the MOD formulated the Defense
Technology Strategy in 2016, which presented the
specific direction for various measures that should be
addressed strategically. Based on this strategy, the MOD
promotes various measures.

**1 Outline of Defense Technology**
**Strategy**

The following is an outline of Japan’s defense technology
strategy.

**(1) MOD Technology Policy Objectives**
The following two objectives of the MOD technology
policy are designed to strengthen the technical
capabilities, which serve as the foundation of Japan’s
defense capabilities, to make the foundation more
robust:
(i) Ensuring technical superiority
(ii) Delivering superior defense equipment through
effective and efficient research and development

**(2) Specific Measures to be Promoted**
The following three measures are promoted to achieve
the objectives as mentioned above.
(i) Grasping Technological Information
With regard to various scientific technologies that
support defense technologies, the MOD grasps the
current situation and trends both in and outside of
Japan, including dual-use technology[2] in the public and
private sectors and cutting-edge scientific technology.
In addition, the MOD develops and publishes the
Medium- to Long-Term Defense Technology Outlook
(see Paragraph 2 below) to identify advanced
technology fields, which have the potential to become
game changers.
(ii) Development of Technologies
The MOD will promote research and development
based on the “Research and Development Vision”


(see Paragraph 3 below). At the same time, the MOD
also promotes research and development that serve as
the foundation of defense force building, technology
exchange with relevant domestic/overseas agencies,
the “Innovative Science & Technology Initiative
for Security” (see 4-2) and intermediary research
on advanced technologies to apply the results of the
initiative to equipment, etc.
(iii) Protection of Technologies
The MOD implements technology control for proper
technology transfer to prevent situations in which
Japan’s technology leaks without the country’s
intention, which would undermine the maintenance of
peace and security in the international community or
the ensuring of Japan’s technological superiority. The
MOD also establishes intellectual property management
taking into account the transfer of defense equipment
and promotes the utilization of intellectual property.

**2 Medium- to Long-Term Defense**
**Technology Outlook**

The Medium- to Long-Term Defense Technology
Outlook presents an outlook of the technologies that
can be applied to equipment expected to be established
in roughly the next 20 years, and indicates technology
fields that need to be developed in order to ensure Japan’s
technological superiority. It is expected that utilizing
this Outlook will facilitate the integration of superior
civilian advanced technologies and the development
of technologies outside of the MOD aimed at defense
equipment applications. The MOD now particularly
aims to take a more strategic approach to important
technologies, including technologies pertaining to new
domains and other potentially game-changing cuttingedge technologies such as AI.

**3 Research and Development (R&D)**

**1 Strengthening the Research and**


**Development System**

In recent years, civilian technologies have made
remarkable progress, and it is believed that these
advanced technologies could revolutionize the future
of warfare. The U.S., China and other countries are
competing with one another to invest heavily in
cultivating an array of civilian technologies, which
will likely result in not only economic competitiveness
but also advantages in terms of security. In addition,
technologies, particularly advanced technologies, have
the potential to be utilized across a variety of fields.
For these reasons, it can be said that it is becoming
increasingly difficult to divide technologies into defense


investment. So far, the MOD has published the R&D
Vision on the Future Fighter Aircraft” (2010), and
the “R&D Vision on Future Unmanned Equipment:
Focusing on Unmanned Aerial Vehicle” (2016), and
the “Research and Development (R&D) Vision-Toward
Realization of the Multi-Domain Defense Force and
Beyond” (2019).

use or civilian use and segment civilian technologies
that can also be used for defense applications under the
concept of “dual use,” which has been the conventional
line of thought. The world is moving into an era in
which all advanced civilian technologies can be used
for security purposes, including defense, and should be
regarded as such. By focusing on the technologies that
our nation possesses across a wide range of fields and by
advancing and utilizing these technologies, Japan will
be able to create superior defense equipment.
In order to strengthen the research and development
system for advanced technologies, the Future
Capabilities Development Center was established in
FY2021 under the Acquisition, Technology & Logistics
Agency to conduct research and development that leads

from the utilization of the results of advanced basic
research to the production of actual defense equipment.
In April 2021, a technology think tank function was
also established in the Acquisition, Technology and
Logistics Agency, led by the Agency’s researchers
(technical officers in research positions) and comprised
of front-line private-sector researchers (special research
officers) with expertise in cutting-edge technology. The
main mission of this function is to research and analyze
technologies that will be important to the future of
Japan’s defense, and to devise new methods of fighting


and game-changing technologies. This new initiative will
be done through collaboration between the public and
private sectors, in which technical officers in research
positions will identify the ways of future warfare and
the technologies needed to achieve them, and special
research officers will research the technologies and
provide instruction. The Technology Collaboration
Support Division, which promotes the application of
technical outcomes from advanced research conducted
by universities, private companies, national research
institutes, etc. was also newly established. In addition,

the Naval Systems Research Center in accordance with
the provisions of the “Basic Policy on the Relocation
of Governmental Organizations”[3] to efficiently and
effectively conduct research and development on
unmanned underwater vehicles (UUVs), etc., utilizing
advanced civilian technologies. The facility is also
expected to conduct collaborative research with the
civilian sector, improve technologies related to the
domestic underwater unmanned vehicle field, revitalize
the local economy, etc.

**2 Shortening Research and Development**

Technological progress is about to fundamentally
change how security should be managed, and major
states endeavor to develop weapons that leverage
cutting-edge technologies. The MOD is also working
to greatly shorten research and development periods
by focusing research in promising technical fields and
rationalizing the research and development process in
order to ensure technological superiority in strategically
important equipment and technology fields such as
technologies in new domains and potentially gamechanging cutting-edge technologies such as AI, and
other important technologies.
Specifically, the MOD has been making efforts to
greatly shorten the research and development periods
of a Hyper Velocity Gliding Projectile Intended for the
Defense of Remote Islands, UUVs with convertible
mission modules, standoff electronic warfare aircraft
and other equipment through the use of initiatives
such as block approach, in which the research and
development of equipment is conducted step by step,
and modularization. In addition, the MOD is working
to improve efficiency in testing and evaluation for
research and development into future submarines by
utilizing test-bed submarine that are type-modified
versions of existing submarines. New technologies such
as AI and lasers are the subject of demonstrations by the
Acquisition, Technology & Logistics Agency to enable
users to imagine how these technologies will be used,
while a concrete image of future equipment is being
developed by collecting information on their technical
feasibility from private companies and other parties at
an early stage and fully analyzing the information.


The MOD has also been promoting the rapid practical
application of technologies by utilizing cutting-edge
civilian technologies with short innovation cycles, such
as AI technology and ICT, and aligning with operational
needs, as the Programs for Rapid Practical Application
of New Technologies, since FY2017.

**3 Development of the Future Fighter**
**Aircraft**

It is vital that Japan continues to employ superior, stateof-the-art fighters in order to ensure air superiority into
the future for the defense of our nation. To this end, it
is important for Japan to take the lead in developing
the future fighter aircraft (F-X) that will replace the
F-2 fighter scheduled for retirement from around 2035
with a view to international cooperation in order to
secure superior air-to-air combat capabilities, as well
as to ensure freedom of modification and expandability
to enable timely and appropriate capacity enhancing
modifications for the next several decades of operation
of the F-X. Furthermore, Japan must possess a domestic
base capable of securing a large number of active aircraft
and ensuring readiness in order to take all possible
measures for our nation’s air defense. To achieve this,
the MOD concluded a contract with Mitsubishi Heavy
Industries, Ltd. in October 2020 as a prime company in
charge of integrating the fighter as a whole, and began
the development.
In developing the F-X, the MOD has been advancing
Japan-led development with necessary support and
cooperation from the U.S., such as starting a new
research project on data link connectivity with the U.S.
Forces’ equipment in 2021 to ensure interoperability
between Japan and the U.S. Furthermore, the MOD
has continued discussions with the U.S. and the U.K.
to pursue the possibility of collaboration on the F-X at
a system level such as engine and electronic component
(avionics) in order to mitigate development cost and
technical risk. In December 2021, Japanese and British
defense authorities confirmed their intent to proceed
with a joint engine demonstrator programme to begin in
January 2022, and decided to conduct joint analysis on
the extent of commonality to explore the feasibility of
further sub-systems collaboration.

the nature of warfare.
For example, the MOD is advancing research and
development of cutting-edge technologies that have the
potential to become game changers, such as artificial
intelligence (AI)-equipped unmanned combat support
unmanned aerial vehicle, high-power microwave
(HPM) irradiation technology capable of dealing with
multiple drones, and high-power lasers and railguns
that are capable of responding to airborne threats more
quickly and at lower cost.

proactively engage in research collaborations and
technological information exchanges in order to ensure
that advanced civilian technology is incorporated and
efficient research and development is conducted.
Domestically, in order to create excellent defense
equipment through the utilization of advanced
technologies and efficiently and effectively conduct
R&D, the MOD has been collaborating closely with

for the development of Japan s science, technology and
innovation in non-defense areas as well, similar to how
investment in innovative technology by the Defense
Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) of
the United States facilitated advances in science and
technology as a whole including civilian technology,
such as the development of the Internet and GPS. From
this perspective, the MOD intends to promote relevant
measures and strives to raise awareness of this program
that contributes to ensuring the freedom of study and its
sound development.
Bridging Research was launched in FY2020
to expedite the identification and development of
promising, advanced technologies from the results
of basic research under the Innovative Science &
Technology Initiative for Security and other sources,
enhance their readiness level, and apply them to the
research and development of equipment. Bridging
Research will continue to be conducted aggressively in
FY2022 with the aim of helping to generate equipment
that will be gamechangers in the future.
In addition, in order to accelerate the research and
development of equipment, the MOD began “Efforts to
Facilitate the Early Practical Use of Game-Changers”
starting in FY2022 as an initiative to commission
private companies to conduct research and improve
their advanced technologies to the point where they can
be used in the research and development of equipment.

See Fig. IV-4-2-3 (FY2021 Awarded Research Projects for the

“Innovative Science & Technology Initiative for Security”
Program)


**2 Identifying and Developing Innovative**
**Technologies and Their Seeds**

In FY2015, the MOD launched a competitive research
funding program called “Innovative Science &
Technology Initiative for Security” to publicly seek
and commission basic research on advanced civilian
technologies, which are expected to contribute to future
research and development in defense areas. A total of
118 research projects were awarded[6] by FY2021. This
program was expanded in FY2017 in order to enable
the awarding of larger-scale and longer-term research
projects, and it will continue to run on a similar scale in
FY2022 (total budget of about 10.1 billion yen).
In the basic research areas, free thinking of researchers
leads to innovative and creative results. For this reason,
it is necessary to assign maximum value to freedom of
research when sponsoring research, so that, for example,
researchers will be able to publish all of their research
results to have a wide range of academic discussions.
Hence, in this program, the MOD will not intervene in
research, restrict contractors’ publication of research
results, or designate research results as confidential,
never providing any confidential data to researchers.
In actuality, some research results have already been
published through oral presentations, publications, etc.
Active utilization of advanced civilian technology
through such programs is not only essential for
securing the lives and peaceful livelihood of the
Japanese people into the future, but is also beneficial

for that program is conducted by an Integrated Project
Team (IPT), which is composed of officials from
relevant divisions within the MOD.
So far (as of the end of March 2022), for each of the 36
items that have been selected for major and semi-major
programs, the MOD has formulated an Acquisition
Strategy and an Acquisition Plan (hereinafter referred
to as “Designated Item Plans”), which specify the basic
matters necessary to systematically implement project
management, such as the purpose of the acquisition
program, acquisition policy, and life cycle cost.
Furthermore, in principle, ATLA annually confirms
the implementation status of the Designated Item
Plans, and endeavors to promote appropriate project
management reflecting the latest situation by conducting
analysis and evaluation, and thus reviews the Designated
Item Plans. In August 2021, analysis and evaluation of
the acquisition programs were implemented for the 31

b. Method for More Accurate Cost Estimate
Life cycle cost has been estimated based on actual cost
data of similar equipment developed or introduced in the
past. However, as a larger amount of cost data is needed
for a more accurate estimate, the MOD promotes the
establishment of a cost database by collecting cost data
and accumulating them into a database.

order to surely bring the review results to fruition.

**2 Long-Term Contracts, etc.**

The production of defense equipment requires a
significant amount of time. Therefore, if a certain amount
is to be procured in bulk, a contract for more than five
years is needed in many cases. With regard to defense
equipment and services, economies of scale[4] tend not to
work mainly due to the following reasons: (1) the MOD
is the only customer; and (2) companies that provide
such defense equipment, etc., are limited. In addition,
it is difficult for companies to systematically move
forward with their businesses with a high degree of
predictability, which is peculiar to the defense industry.
For these reasons, the upper limit of acts that incur
national debt prescribed in the Public Finance Act as
within five years in principle was changed to within ten
years for specific equipment through the enactment of
the Long-term Contract Act.[5] The introduction of this
change regarding long-term contracts will make stable
procurement possible, leading to the realization of the
systematic improvement of defense capability. At the
same time, for companies, given that the procurement
amount will be assured, the systematic use of personnel
and equipment, as well as cost reductions due to bulk
orders, will be made possible.

See Part II, Chapter 4, Section 2-3 (Initiatives for Increasing the

costs, by reducing risks for those taking orders and
by promoting the entry of new suppliers. As projects
using the PFI Act, the MOD launched the “project


of development and operation of X-band satellite
communications” in January 2013 and the “project of
operation and management of private ships” in March
2016.
In addition, regarding procurement of certain
equipment with which little competitiveness can be
expected due to its characteristics, and companies that
work on cost reduction using the MOD’s programs,
the MOD promotes limited tendering contracts
while ensuring transparency and fairness as well as
clarifying and putting the subject into patterns, from
the perspective of the implementation of smooth and
efficient procurement, and the enhancement of the
company’s predictability.
Specifically, in acquiring new types of destroyers
(FFM),[7] the MOD adopted a procurement method in
February 2017 that selects the party that has made the
best proposal with respect to the MOD’s requirements
as the procurement counterparty, with the runner-up
also involved in designing and building facilities as
a subcontractor. This made it possible to acquire new
types of destroyers (FFM) efficiently equipped with
the necessary functions and to maintain and strengthen
the construction technology base. The MOD concluded
a proposal agreement in April 2017 and decided on a
procurement counterparty and a subcontractor in August
2017.

**3 Decrease Procurement Cost and**
**Improve Companies’ Incentives to**
**Reduce Cost**

With regard to the procurement of defense equipment,
the cost is tending to increase because a large variety
of equipment has no market price. Based on those
characteristics, it is necessary to achieve both the
reduction of procurement cost and improvement of
companies’ incentives to reduce cost simultaneously.
To achieve this, the ATLA has been applying the
incentivized risk-sharing management contract system
to the F-X project and the stand-off electronic warfare


This is a system to conduct research, which contributes to the acquisition system of defense equipment, by inviting experts, such as associate professors from different universities specializing
in the areas of concern, in order to review and reconsider an effective procurement system, based not only on the viewpoints of the MOD personnel but also on theories that have been proposed
in the field of business administration and economics.

“Economies of scale” refers to the cost advantage that arises with an increased output of a product. For example, costs per unit can be reduced by a bulk purchase of materials.

“Special Measures Law Concerning the Term of Expenditure Based on the Obligatory Assurance of National Subsidization for Specific Defense Procurement” (enacted in April 2015. An act for its
partial revision to extend the effective period by five years was enacted in March 2019.)

Under this system, the public and private sectors
jointly manage the performance and progress of the
contract, manage the cost and minimize the risk of cost
overruns and schedule delays. When the cost is reduced,

**and Replenishment**

With regard to periodic maintenance of defense
equipment, the MOD has been working to improve
efficiency by extending the maintenance interval, after
making sufficient efforts to ensure safety. Moreover, the
MOD is working to expand umbrella contracts such as
performance based logistics (PBL)[8] from the perspective
of improving the equipment’s operational availability
and keeping long-term costs reduced. Furthermore,
the MOD is seeking to reduce costs by purchasing two
types of C-2 transport aircraft engines in bulk through
the FY2021 supplementary budget.


the contractor to reduce the cost.
In addition, a system to provide incentives for cost
reductions has also been implemented since April 2020
in order to evaluate companies’ own cost reduction
efforts. The expansion of the scope of application and
other approaches to encouraging such efforts have been
continuously considered.

in the past. The MOD expects this database to be utilized
not only to verify the validity of procurement prices, but
also to enhance the accuracy and efficiency of life cycle
cost estimation for new equipment.

See Part II, Chapter 4, Section 2-3 (Initiatives for Increasing the

Efficiency of Procurement)

**3 Efforts to Increase Fairness and**
**Transparency**

The MOD implements measures for making contracts
more appropriate and strengthening checking functions
to promote the enhancement of fairness and transparency
in relation to the acquisition of equipment and materials.
As a part of the effort to “make public procurement
more appropriate” across the whole government,
the MOD continues to carry out the introduction and
expansion of a comprehensive evaluation bidding
system[9] and make bidding procedures more efficient.
In addition to these, based on reflection on the past,
strengthening system investigation, reviewing penalties,
ensuring the effectiveness of supervision and inspection,
and other measures have steadily been carried out
in order to prevent recurrence of such incidents as
overcharging and falsified results of equipment testing
by defense-related companies in 2012. Through these
measures, the MOD strives to surely prevent recurrence
of scandals, enhance fairness and transparency, and
make contracts more appropriate.
In addition, the ATLA carries out multilayered checks
on the contracts it administers through both internal and
external checking systems and checks and balances



Part II, Chapter 4, Section 2-3 (Initiatives for Increasing the
Efficiency of Procurement)


See


**2 Achieving Further Efficiency in the**
**Acquisition of Defense Equipment**

When acquiring defense equipment, the MOD aims
to reduce development, acquisition, and maintenance
expenses through the development of product families,
standardization of equipment specifications, joint
procurement of equipment common to multiple SDF
services, etc., in addition to a review of the contract
system. For example, in the FY2022 annual budget, the
MOD expects to be able to reduce the cost of Type-12
surface-to-ship guided missile model prototypes (with
improved abilities) by making them capable of being
fired from the ground, from warships, and from aircraft.
In addition, the MOD has been facilitating the
compilation of a database on the breakdown of


Multi-year umbrella contracts for equipment inspections, repairs, and other sustainment and maintenance work with added conditions shortening repair times, ensuring a certain level of inventory,
etc. in order to improve equipment availability

Unlike the automatic bid system, which focuses only on price, this is a system whereby the successful bidder is determined on the basis of a comprehensive evaluation that includes both the price

by the Arms Export Control Act (AECA) etc. that may
enable the U.S. allies and others to purchase defense
equipment and services from the U.S. government.
The characteristics of FMS include: (1) pricing is an
estimate, (2) payments are made in advance in principle
and balanced out after fulfillment, and (3) the delivery
date is an estimate. This program allows Japan to
procure equipment with a high level of confidentiality
that cannot be generally purchased through Direct
Commercial Sales and highly capable equipment.
Therefore, FMS is critical to strengthen Japan’s defense
capabilities.
Meanwhile, there are FMS-related challenges, such
as late delivery and late case closure. As the FMS
procurement amount is hovering at a high level in recent
years, the governments of Japan and the U.S. have been
actively working together to make improvements in
these challenges.
Specifically, the ATLA and Defense Security


General s Office of Legal Compliance. Moreover,
ATLA has also improved its education department and
strives to enhance compliance awareness by providing
thorough education pertaining to compliance for ATLA
personnel.

**Promoting Initiative towards Rationalization of Foreign Military Sales (FMS) Procurement**

Cooperation Agency (DSCA) have held the Security
Cooperation Consultative Meeting (SCCM) to discuss
the challenges over FMS procurement, six times since
2016.
At the 6th SCCM held in February 2022, Japan and the
U.S. agreed to continue strengthening case management
between them in terms of late deliveries and late case
closure, and to promote efforts to reduce the number of
late deliveries and late case closures.
With regard to transparency in pricing, DSCA also
confirmed that it will provide guidance to the relevant
organizations in the U.S. Department of Defense on
providing cost information and reasons behind price
increases. DSCA also confirmed that it will strive to
limit price increases for FMS-procured items caused by
the spread of COVID-19 and other factors, and improve
predictability in terms of prices. The MOD will continue
to promote the rationalization of FMS procurement.

For the purpose of maintaining and strengthening Japan’s
defense production and technological bases, which is
an important and essential element supporting Japan’s
defense capability, the “Strategy on Defense Production
and Technological Bases” was formulated in June 2014.
The Strategy responded to the National Security Strategy
and the 2013 NDPG, replacing “Kokusankahoshin
(guideline for domestic development/production).”[4]

See Reference 2 (National Security Strategy (Outline))

See


**2 Overview of Defense Production and**
**Technological Bases**

**(1) Significance of Formulation of the Strategy on**
**Defense Production and Technological Bases**

“The Strategy on Defense Production and Technological
Bases” has made the following three points clear:
(1) the context of the formulation of the strategy on
defense production and technological bases and where
this strategy stands; (2) characteristics of defense
production and technological bases; and (3) changes in
the environment surrounding defense production and
technological bases.

**(2) Goals and Significance of Maintaining and**
**Strengthening Defense Production and**
**Technological Bases**

Through maintaining and strengthening defense
production and technological bases, the MOD intends


April 2014. However, improvement of international
competitiveness has become a challenge for Japan’s
defense industry, because it has developed based on the
production of defense equipment only for the SDF.

See Fig. IV-4-4-1 (Changes in Maintenance and Upgrade

Expenditures for Major Equipment, etc.)
Section 5-1 (Three Principles on Transfer of Defense
Equipment and Technology)

to (1) ensure sovereignty of security, (2) potentially
contribute to increasing deterrence capability, and
maintain and improve bargaining power, and (3)
contribute to the sophistication of the domestic industry
in Japan driven by cutting-edge technology.

**(3) Basic Viewpoints for Promoting Measures**
For the promotion of measures, the MOD takes into
account the following basic viewpoints: (1) establishing
long-term partnership between the private and public
sectors; (2) strengthening international competitiveness;
and (3) ensuring consistency with efficient and optimized
acquisition of defense equipment.

**(4) Defense Equipment Procurement Methods**
With regard to defense equipment procurement,
currently multiple methods, such as domestic
development, international joint development and
production, licensed domestic production, utilization
of commercially produced goods, and imports, are
adopted. According to the characteristics of defense
equipment, the MOD appropriately selects acquisition
methods, including international joint development and
production, which have become more agile and flexible
due to the Three Principles on Transfer of Defense
Equipment and Technology.

**(5) Measures for Maintaining and Strengthening**
**Defense Production and Technological Bases**

In order to maintain and strengthen defense production
and technological bases, the MOD will promote the
following measures with a focus on variation and
efficiency, while considering Japan’s severe fiscal
condition: (1) improvement in the contract system; (2)

**1 Past Initiatives**


Based on the Strategy on Defense Production and
Technological Bases, the MOD has implemented
various measures contributing to the maintenance and
strengthening of the defense industrial base, such as
improving the contract system, including the enactment
of the Long-term Contract Act, and the establishment of
ATLA, which integrated the organizations involved in
the defense equipment procurement.
In addition, the following new measures are also
taken in ATLA: (1) formulation of Defense Technology
Strategy, etc. for ensuring the technological superiority,
and implementation of the “Innovative Science &
Technology Initiative for Security” (see Section 2);
(2) formulation of the Acquisition Strategic Plan for
promoting project management, and improvement of
contract systems (see Section 3); (3) grasping the supply
chain in the defense industry and responses to risks in
order to maintain and strengthen the defense industrial
base (see Paragraph 2 below); and (4) participation of
Japanese companies in the international F-35 fighter
aircraft program and defense equipment and technology
cooperation involving joint research and development
with other countries (see Section 5).

**2 Initiatives Based on the NDPG**

In order to strengthen Japan’s defense industrial
base, which is essential to the production, operation,


(such as land equipment, supplies, etc., ships, aircraft,
explosives, guided weapons, communications
electronics and command control systems, unmanned
equipment, space and cyber systems), the MOD will
analyze the current situation of defense production
and technological bases. At the same time, based on
the priority matters for developing the SDF’s structure
indicated in the 2013 NDPG, the MOD will present the
future direction of the maintenance and strengthening
of defense production and technological bases and the
acquisition plan for each defense equipment sectors, and
thereby, seek to increase predictability for companies.

sustainment and maintenance of defense equipment, the
MOD will work on the following initiatives based on
the NDPG, etc., while considering the orientation of the
defense production and technology strategy.

**(1) Reforming the Existing Contract System towards**
**Creating a Competitive Environment among**
**Companies**

Japan’s defense industry is in a less competitive
environment as there are many defense equipment items
that only one company can produce. To address this
issue, the MOD will review the existing contract system
towards creation of a competitive environment among
companies by actively evaluating initiatives and results
which contribute to strengthening the competitiveness
of the defense industry and cost reduction, as well as
giving appropriate incentives based on the evaluation
result.

**(2) Strengthening Risk Management of Supply**
**Chain for Defense Equipment**

The procurement of defense equipment involves not only
prime companies that directly contract with the MOD
but also supplier companies in a broad range of fields
and sizes, which contract with the prime companies.
The chains of these companies (supply chains) are
the basis of Japan’s defense industry. However, these
supply chains are confronted with risks, such as supply
disruption due to withdrawing or bankruptcy of some
manufacturing companies. In order to deal with the


**Chapter**
**4**


-----

risks, the MOD is taking measures in order to maintain
and strengthen the supply chains.
Past supply chain surveys revealed the presence of
small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) that have
a high dependency rate on defense equipment. In the
supply chain survey conducted by the end of FY2021,[6]
key suppliers holding irreplaceable technologies
were identified. Additionally, vulnerabilities became
apparent, such as a concentration of orders to a certain
supplier. Based on the survey results, the MOD is
creating a database of the results of the supply chain
survey, and building a regular monitoring system for
early identification of risks, such as supply disruption.
Furthermore, the MOD is making efforts to identify
SMEs that have excellent technologies/products and has
been supporting business transfer when an enterprise
in the supply chain withdraws from the business since
FY2021. The MOD will also properly deal with the
vulnerabilities in the supply chain and strengthen the
supply chain through initiatives such as evaluation of
the possibility of application of innovative technologies
represented by the 3D printer and AI to the manufacturing
process of defense equipment.

**(3) Further Industrial Participation of Japan’s**
**Defense Industry in Sustainment and**
**Maintenance of Imported Equipment**

Industrial participation in the sustainment and
maintenance business of imported equipment is
productive for the strengthening of Japan’s industrial
base. For this purpose, it is important to pursue
participation in the sustainment and maintenance of
F-35A fighter aircraft, Osprey, and other imported
equipment and benefits for domestic companies through
further promotion of joint R&D of high-capability
equipment with the United States and other countries.[7]

**(4) Promoting Appropriate Overseas Transfer of**
**Defense Equipment under the Three Principles**
**on Transfer of Defense Equipment and**
**Technology**

The government as a whole will work on necessary


improvement in implementation of related rules for
promoting appropriate overseas transfer of defense
equipment. At the same time, the MOD will strengthen
intellectual property management, technology control
and information security to prevent leakages of
important technologies regarding defense equipment.
a. Initiatives for Necessary Operational Improvement
The MOD, in cooperation with relevant ministries
and agencies, will work on necessary improvement
in implementation of related rules based on the Three
Principles on Transfer of Defense Equipment and
Technology, which are the operational standards for the
Foreign Exchange and Foreign Trade Act. As a result,
the MOD will enhance predictability for the defense
industry and will promote appropriate and smooth
equipment transfer.
Specifically, it is necessary to improve the
implementation of relevant systems and procedures,
which include rationalization of the handling of basic
marketing information necessary for early business talks
at international trade shows, etc.,[8] in order to ensure the
smooth provision of such information.
b. Preventing Leakage of Key Technologies
(a) Intellectual Property Management
Through the application of more appropriate contract
provisions regarding intellectual property, the MOD
will accurately grasp intellectual property generated
through R&D, etc., to promote the clarification of public
or private belongings and prevention of leakages of key
technologies to abroad. The ministry will also present
options regarding the opening or closing of intellectual
properties based on the characteristics of the technology
and promotes appropriate management for each option.
(b) Technology Control
The MOD is working to prevent technology leakage by
such means as ensuring prompt and proper assessment
of technological sensitivity based on the importance
and superiority of the technologies, which is needed in
the examination of the propriety of overseas transfer
of defense equipment and technology. Also, in order to
prevent leakages of sensitive technologies, the MOD,
in cooperation with relevant ministries and agencies,


By the end of FY2021, the MOD conducted a supply chain survey of 68 major defense equipment items.

SM-3 block IIA, jointly developed by Japan and the United States, is subject to FMS procurement, but Japanese companies have received contracts for manufacturing about half of the
components, including those procured by the United States.

In October 2018, the Q&A section of the Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry website made it clear that information on the performance of goods and other matters that is used in early stage
business talks and that does not include “specific information necessary for design, manufacture or use,” such as design information and production technique, is not subject to regulation under
the Foreign Exchange Act. At the request of companies, the MOD is currently confirming the range of information included in data created by a company that may be disclosed to the public and


**Chapter**
**4**


-----

promotes studies on reverse engineering countermeasure
technologies, such as black box constitution.
(c) Strengthening Information Security
For Japan’s defense industry to participate in international
businesses, it is necessary to respond to increasing
threats of cyber attacks. With the aim of strengthening
information security measures, the MOD developed
the Defense Industrial Cybersecurity Standard, a new
information security standard applicable to contractors
handling the MOD’s information to be protected[9] that
includes control measures on par with the standards that
U.S. Department of Defense contractors are obligated
to meet.
In order to further encourage companies to consider
entry into defense procurement business and facilitate
their business with defense-related companies in Japan
and abroad, it is important to improve the predictability
of the necessary security measures for the companies.
For this purpose, the MOD will develop an information
security guidebook that comprehensively defines
security measures that will normally be required for
concluding a contract, which involves the handling of
information to be secured, with the MOD in advance.

**(5) Other Initiatives to Achieve Efficiency and**
**Strength**

Other than the above-mentioned initiatives, the
MOD/SDF will undertake measures such as making
the equipment manufacturing process efficient and
thoroughly reducing cost and will strive to make Japan’s
defense industry base efficient and resilient while
foreseeing possible realignment and consolidation of
businesses that may occur as a result of these measures.


**3 Cooperation/Collaboration with the**
**Industry**

The maintenance and strengthening of Japan’s
technological and industrial base are essential for
production, operation and maintenance of defense
equipment. For the effort of “Reinforcing Technology
Base” and “Strengthening Defense Industrial Base” that
are provided in NDPG and MTDP, cooperation between
the MOD and the industry is indispensable.
In this context, in October 2019, then Defense Minister
Kono and executives of the Japan Business Federation
exchanged opinions on a wide range of themes,
including international situations and defense policy
in addition to defense equipment policy, and discussed
the strengthening of public-private cooperation in
general. Since November of the same year, ATLA and
the Defense Industry Committee of the Japan Business
Federation had exchanged opinions on eight occasions
on “Overseas Transfer of Defense Equipment and
Technology,” “Maintaining and Strengthening Supply
Chains,” “Aggressive Utilization of Advanced Civilian
Technology,” “Strengthening Information Security,”
and other issues. The outcome of the sessions was
reported to Defense Minister Kishi and executives of the
Japan Business Federation and received their approval
in December 2020.
The MOD will continue to enhance public-private
cooperation in order to strengthen the defense industrial
and technological bases as is explicitly stated in the
NDPG, such as by initiating exchanges of views with
the defense industry (major prime contractors) from
February 2022 and the Minister of Defense Kishi
meeting with the presidents of major prime contractors
in one place to share problems and challenges that both
sides have identified in April 2022.

**Deepening Relationships with the United States regarding Defense Equipment and Technology Cooperation**

**Overhaul and Upgrade (MRO&U) Capability**

In December 2011, Japan selected the F-35A fighter
aircraft to be the successor to the F-4 fighter aircraft.
At the same time, the Government decided to procure
42 aircraft from FY2012 onwards and to have Japanese
industries participate in its production, aside from
several completed aircraft, which will be imported.[2]
In light of this decision, the Japanese Government has
been working to enable the involvement of Japanese
industries in the manufacturing process in preparation
for the acquisition of F-35A fighter aircraft from
FY2013 onwards. So far the Japanese companies have
participated in the Final Assembly and Check Out
(FACO) for airframe and engines, and the manufacture
of related parts.
In light of the severe financial condition, for the
procurement of F-35A fighters in FY2019 and after, the
MOD decided to utilize the more cost effective means
of importing completed aircraft.
Later, however, as a result of cost reduction efforts
by the manufacturers, including improvement in the
manufacturing process and reduction of person-hours
through work skill improvement, it was confirmed that
the FACO by domestic companies would make the price
lower than importing completed aircraft. For this reason,
for the FY2019 to FY2022 procurements, the MOD has
decided to procure F-35A fighters finally assembled and
completed by domestic companies.[3]

In addition, as F-35 fighter aircraft are operated
worldwide, the U.S. Government decided to establish

Japan that the nations which have a cooperative and
friendly relationship with Japan in terms of security and


requesting to use SDF equipment that is no longer in
use. However, Article 9, paragraph (1) of the Public
Finance Act[21] stipulates that the Government must
receive reasonable consideration when transferring
or leasing any governmental properties including the
SDF’s equipment to other countries. Therefore, a grant
or a transfer at a lower price than the current price is not
allowed except when permitted by law.
Under these circumstances, to respond to the needs
of such friendly nations, the MOD established a special
provision of Article 9, paragraph (1) of the Public
Finance Act in the SDF Act and it went into force in
June 2017. The provision enables the MOD to grant or
transfer the SDF’s equipment which is no longer used
to the governments of developing states at a lower price
than the current price.
Even in the case of granting or transferring equipment
at a lower price than the current price as per this provision,

**Military Intelligence Collection**
**1**

For formulating defense policy accurately in response analyzing military communication signals and signals

to the changes in the situation and for operating
defense capabilities effectively in dealing with various
situations, it is necessary to grasp medium- to longterm military trends in the neighboring countries of
Japan and to detect the indications of various situations
promptly. To this end, the MOD/SDF is making efforts
to collect information swiftly and accurately daily by
using various methods.
Examples of intelligence collection means used by
the MOD/SDF include: (1) collecting, processing and


analyzing military communication signals and signals
emanating from electronic weapons in the air over
Japan; (2) collecting, processing, and analyzing data
from various imagery satellites (including Information
Gathering Satellite (IGS));[1] (3) surveillance activities
by ships, aircraft and other assets; (4) collecting and
organizing a variety of open source information; (5)
information exchanges with defense organizations of
other nations; and (6) intelligence collection conducted
by defense attachés and other officials.
As for the defense attachés, in FY2021, the MOD

**Headquarters**

The Defense Intelligence Headquarters is the central
intelligence agency of the MOD and the largest
intelligence agency of Japan. It was established in 1997
in order to develop a framework for sophisticated and
comprehensive information gathering and analysis
in the increasingly complicated security environment
following the Cold War. The Headquarters gathers
SIGINT, IMINT, GEOINT, OSINT, etc., and analyzes
international and military situations, and other matters
related to Japan’s swiftly changing security environment.

**2 Activities of the Defense Intelligence**
**Headquarters**

The Defense Intelligence Headquarters is an organization
consisting of Ground Self-Defense Force (GSDF),
Maritime Self-Defense Force (MSDF) and Air SelfDefense Force (ASDF) personnel, and administrative
and technical officials (specialized in language,
technology, administration or general office). SDF
personnel use the knowledge based on their experience
in their unit, whereas administrative/technical officials
use their expert knowledge in language, technology, and
other fields. They are working together for their mission.
Specifically, they conduct comprehensive analysis

diverse perspectives, including military, political and
economic factors, based on information received from a
wide range of sources including SIGINT, IMINT, OSINT
(newspapers, internet, etc.) and opinion exchange with
relevant parties.
The Defense Intelligence Headquarters is also
strengthening information gathering and analyzing
functions in new areas such as space, cyberspace and
electromagnetic spectrum. For example, it conducts
the collection and analysis of necessary information
regarding trends in threats in cyberspace through such
means as collecting OSINT and exchanging information
with other countries.
In addition, the Defense Intelligence Headquarters
increased the number of personnel in FY2022 in order
to strengthen its system for gathering and analyzing
information on the economic security of other countries.
Results of the Defense Intelligence Headquarters’
intelligence service are provided as analysis products to
the Prime Minister, the Minister of Defense, the National

**2 Efforts to Develop Understanding and**
**Cooperation Concerning the Stationing**
**of the USFJ**

Amid the increasingly severe security environment
surrounding Japan, maintaining the presence of the
USFJ and its readiness is vitally important for ensuring
the security of Japan.
For stable stationing of the USFJ, it is essential to
obtain the understanding and cooperation of the local
governments and residents in the vicinities of defense
facilities.
For this purpose, the MOD will work to share this
recognition with the United States at various levels
including the Japan-U.S. Defense Ministerial Meeting.
The ministry will also constantly take various measures,
including coordination for unit operation of the USFJ
with the local governments and other parties, provision
of subsidies pertaining to the USFJ realignment, prompt
information provision to the local government in a
case of incident or accidents, and exchange promotion
between the USFJ and local residents.

**(1) Coordination for Unit Operation of the USFJ with**
**the Local Governments, etc.**

The MOD is working to promote local understanding of
the maintenance of USFJ facilities and unit operations
through coordination, including prior explanation
to the relevant local governments and residents at
every occasion of USFJ realignment, training, unit
deployment, new equipment deployment, etc.

**(2) Grants, etc., to Promote the USFJ Realignment**
During a period of time before and after the
implementation of the USFJ realignment[5] (10 years


in principle), realignment grants are provided to help
cover the expenses of projects,[7] which contribute to
improving the convenience of the residents’ lives in
local municipalities affected by the realignment and
stimulating the local industries. These grants are provided
in accordance with the progress of the realignment, after
the Defense Minister designates the specified defense
facilities and neighboring municipalities affected by the
realignment.
As of April 2022, ten municipalities for eight defense
facilities are eligible to receive the realignment grants.
In order to promote the realignment, additional measures
are taken with budgetary provision.

See Reference 66 (Outline of Measures to Promote Harmony

Between Defense Facilities and Surrounding Areas)

**(3) Ensuring Safety of Operations of the USFJ**
Ensuring the safety of local residents is of prime
importance in USFJ operations, and no accident or
incident must occur.
In case of incidents arising with respect to U.S. military
aircraft, such as crashes, emergency landings [8], falling or
missing parts, or similar, the MOD ensures the thorough
safety management and prevention of a reoccurrence
are conducted while also swiftly requesting information
from the U.S. side. As well as immediately passing
on the information obtained to relevant ministries and
agencies, the MOD has been taking measures to enable
swift and appropriate compensation of victims of an
accident or incident.
Considering anxiety and concerns among local
residents, Japan has been fully communicating its
approach to the U.S. side including at the top and
ministerial levels. The two countries closely cooperate
to secure safe operation as the top priority.
The MOD is also concerned about accidents/
incidents due to drinking caused by U.S. Forces military
personnel and others and has requested the U.S. side on
multiple occasions to reinforce official discipline and
personnel education.
The United States has also taken measures for its
part, putting in place its guidelines for off-duty action
(liberty policy), including measures such as alcohol


Under the Act on Special Measures for Smooth Implementation of the Realignment of the United States Forces in Japan, changes in the composition of naval fleets (replacement of the aircraft
carrier, at Commander Fleet Activities Yokosuka, with a nuclear aircraft carrier) that integrally operate with air wings subject to the realignment are treated in the same way as the realignment.

Approximately 4.1 billion yen in the FY2022 budget

As stipulated in Article 2 of the Enforcement Ordinance of the Act on Special Measures for Smooth Implementation of the Realignment of the United States Forces in Japan, there are 14 specific
projects including education, sports, and cultural projects.

restrictions at nighttime as well as curfews applying
to U.S. Forces personnel ranked below a certain rank.
Both the countries will continue cooperation to prevent
recurrence of incidents related to drinking.

**(4) Promoting Exchange between the USFJ and**
**Local Residents**

The MOD holds a Japan-U.S. exchange program to
deepen mutual understanding between Japan and the
United States with the understanding and cooperation
of the local governments and USFJ. Under the program,
residents living near USFJ facilities and areas together
with USFJ personnel enjoy sports, music and cultural
exchanges.
The USFJ also has initiatives to deepen mutual
understanding with people of the local communities,
which include opening up of its bases (Friendship day)
and information provision through websites and social
media.

**(5) Other Measures (Including Measures Pertaining**
**to the SDF)**

(1) Compensation for Fisheries
The MOD defines the confined water for training, etc.


carried out by the SDF or the USFJ using water surface
based on laws or a contract and compensates for losses
incurred from the restriction.
(2) Base Subsidy, etc.
The MOD provides cooperation by doing such things
as providing various information also for the subsidy
for municipalities where national defense facilities are
located (“Base Subsidy”), and the Adjustment Grants
for municipalities where defense facilities are located
(“Adjustment Grants”), both of which are under the
defense facilities-related subsidy system under the
jurisdiction of the Ministry of Internal Affairs and
Communications.
The Base Subsidy has been established considering
that the facilities used by the U.S. Forces and the SDF
such as airports have a significant impact on municipal
finance. The subsidy has a nature of substituting for
fixed property tax and is granted to municipalities where
such facilities are located.
The Adjustment Grants are provided to municipalities
where USFJ properties are located as such properties
are exempt from fixed asset tax, and U.S. Armed Forces
personnel and civilian employees are exempt from
municipal tax, etc.

**2 SDF Athletes in Action**

In addition to the nine sports the MOD/SDF has
traditionally trained athletes in (wrestling, boxing,
judo, shooting, weight lifting, archery, track and field,
swimming, and modern pentathlon), it established
special physical education training courses for women’s
rugby and canoeing starting from FY2017, training and
strengthening athletes in these 11 sports to promote
the development of SDF athletes for the Tokyo 2020
Games.
As a result, 17 SDF personnel from the SDF Physical
Training School competed in ten events at the Olympics,
winning five medals (three gold, one silver, and one
bronze), the most in the school’s history.

**3 Cooperation in Olympic Ceremonies**
**and Operations**

The MOD/SDF, at the request of the Tokyo Organising
Committee of the Olympic and Paralympic Games,
gave a demonstration flight by Blue Impulse aircraft
and a performance by the SDF band at the Olympic
flame arrival ceremony, cooperated with the Organising


Committee on cybersecurity measures, and offered use
of GSDF Asaka Camp and other SDF facilities free of
charge ahead of the Games.
During the Games, approximately 8,500 personnel
provided cooperation on the hoisting of the national
flag and other flags, medical services at the venue for
shooting sports, marine rescue in sailing, control in
and outside of venues, and the operation of the archery,
shooting and modern pentathlon events.
Blue Impulse aircraft also gave demonstration flights
on the opening days of both the Tokyo 2020 Olympic
and Paralympic Games.

**1 Response to Cases of Interference**


**against SDF and U.S. Forces Aircraft**
**by Laser Irradiation and Kite Flying**

Cases of interference by laser irradiation and kite
flying against the SDF and U.S. Forces aircraft in flight
have been occurring frequently. These are extremely
dangerous and malicious acts that may disrupt a pilot’s
ability to operate aircraft and result in a catastrophe
such as a crash. Therefore, the MOD disseminates
information regarding the risks involved in these acts
to local residents by putting up posters and requests
their cooperation in reporting to the police while
closely cooperating with relevant local governments.
Additionally, the Ordinance for Enforcement of the
Civil Aeronautics Act was revised in December 2016,
making these interference acts subject to regulation as
well as fines and other penalties.

**2 Response to Small Unmanned Aerial**
**Systems Mainly Drones Flying over**
**Defense Facilities and Surrounding**
**Airspace**

In recent years there have been terror attacks overseas
(including attempted ones) using small drones, including
commercial drones, some of which are targeted at
military facilities. Given such a situation, there is a
concern that drone terror attacks on the SDF/USFJ
facilities and areas can also happen in Japan, and if these
facilities are endangered, the function as foundations to
defend our nation can be seriously affected. To address
such a concern, the Act on Prohibition of Flight of UASs
around and over Key Facilities commonly known as the
“Drone Act” was enforced on June 13, 2019, to prohibit
small drones from flying over the SDF/USFJ facilities
and areas designated by the Minister of Defense As

The GSDF is contributing to local disaster prevention
countermeasures and strengthening cooperation with
local communities through these activities.

**3 Response to the Act on Review and**
**Regulation of Real Estate Usage**

In accordance with a statement by the National Security
Strategy, established in December 2013, that Japan will
review issues related to the use, etc. of land in areas such
as areas surrounding defense facilities from a national
security viewpoint, the MOD has, since FY2013, been
conducting research to secure a systematic understanding
of the situation of land ownership in areas surrounding
defense facilities. On July 17, 2020, the Government of
Japan issued the Basic Policy on Economic and Fiscal
Management and Reform 2020 by Cabinet Decision,
where it was stated that “from the standpoint of national
security, the government will strive to ascertain the
status of property ownership through information
gathering and other means by the relevant government
offices, and the government will take the necessary
measures after considering how best to use and manage
property.” According to this statement, the Cabinet
Secretariat reviewed the issues based on, among other
things, recommendations from the Advisory Panel on
assessment of the actual state of land use, etc. After
this consideration, the Bill on Review of Real Estate
Ownership and Regulation of Its Use near Sensitive
Facilities and on Border Islands was approved by
Cabinet Decision on March 26, 2021 and submitted to
the 204th Diet. The bill was passed and ratified on June
16 the same year, and the Act was promulgated on June
23 On the situation where the security environment is

becoming more severe and uncertain, the Act authorizes
the Prime Minister to designate areas surrounding
sensitive facilities and on remote islands near national
borders to be protected against interference from the
land, etc., and to investigate and if necessary regulate
land use in the areas. This Act has great significance for
the purpose of fully ensuring the functions of defense
facilities, which are the foundations of national defense.
The Basic Policy on Economic and Fiscal Management
and Reform 2021 (the “Basic Policy 2021”) issued on


June 18 by Cabinet Decision clearly states that [t]he
Government will promptly establish an enforcement
system for the Act on Review and Regulation of Real
Estate Usage, and will promptly and steadily conduct a
review of the status of real estate usage in ‘Monitored
Areas,’ etc., after the Act comes into effect.” The MOD
will establish a system to cooperate with the review of
the status of real estate usage conducted by the Cabinet
Office and will work to respond appropriately upon
doing so.

of measures needed to ensure that the MOD/SDF is
able to continue to properly fulfil its assigned role and
missions. The MOD aims to respond to climate change
while simultaneously maintaining and strengthening
its defense capabilities, and will compile a strategy
document based on discussions by the Climate Change
Taskforce.

**2 Procuring Renewable Energy**
**Electricity**

The MOD/SDF, being responsible for 250,000 SDF
personnel, operating facilities and various equipment all
around Japan, and as the largest consumer of electricity
among government institutions (accounting for
approximately 40% of total government consumption),
has actively promoted the procurement of electricity
generated by renewable energy sources (hereafter
referred to as “renewable energy electricity”) for MOD/
SDF facilities since FY2020 in order to contribute to
reducing greenhouse gas emissions and other goals.
In FY2022, the MOD held 964 contracts to procure
electricity for its facilities, etc. nationwide, of which 291
facilities, etc. procured electricity containing renewable
energy electricity. Furthermore, 199 procured 100%
of their electricity from renewable energy sources.
The expected amount of renewable energy electricity
procured in FY2022 is 320 million kWh (annual
electricity consumption of more than 70,000 general
households). It means that approximately 25% of
all electricity expected to be used by the MOD/SDF
(approximately 1.29 billion kWh) in FY2022 will be
procured in the form of renewable energy electricity.
As a member of the government, the MOD will
continue to make efforts to raise the proportion of
renewable energy electricity


**3 Balancing Renewable Energy**
**Electricity and Security**

The introduction of renewable sources of energy,
including wind power, is being promoted in response
to the issue of climate change, and the number of wind
power generation facilities is expected to increase
moving forward. Depending on the location and height
of these wind power generation facilities, they may
potentially impact the activities of the SDF and U.S.
Forces in Japan by blocking radio waves emitted by
warning and control radars and making it difficult to
detect aircraft and missiles, etc.
To address these issues, the MOD/SDF coordinates
with project operators and other related parties
meticulously from the early stages of project planning.
The MOD/SDF will continue to promote measures to
achieve balance between renewable energy and security
while avoiding impacts on the activities of the SDF and
U.S. Forces in Japan caused by the installation of wind
power generation facilities.

**4 MOD’s Action Plan for PFOS Disposal**

The MOD has established the Action Plan for PFOS
Disposal regarding aqueous film-forming foam,
etc. containing PFOS and has been replacing and
disposing of said foam, etc. With the exception of
select equipment, such as fire extinguishing equipment
subject to alteration, the replacement and disposal work
was completed by the end of FY2021, and the MOD
is swiftly proceeding with replacement and disposal in

USFJ is committed to appropriate environmental environments and the rapid replacement and disposal


management to protect the environment in the
surrounding areas and to secure the safety of U.S.
military personnel and residents in the surrounding
areas according to the Supplementary Agreement on
Cooperation in the Field of Environmental Stewardship
and the Japan Environmental Governing Standards
(JEGS) established by USFJ.

**1 Efforts to Save Utilities**

In USFJ facilities and areas, efforts are made to save
utilities, which include changes to energy-efficient
heating/ventilation/air-conditioning equipment;
installation of motion sensors for lights-out during
absence; installation of solar panels; reduction of the
period to use cooling/ heating equipment and review
of the preset temperature; and control of lighting and
lights-out for night lighting, for example.

**2 Responding to Issues concerning**
**PFOS**

The government is working together to advance efforts
to address the issues surrounding PFOS, such as setting
provisional target values for tap water and water


containing PFOS in the past detected PFOS and other
substances in the water from some tanks. The MOD
intends to take appropriate measures based on the
results of the survey.

environments and the rapid replacement and disposal
of aqueous film-forming foam in the possession of the
SDF and fire departments. USFJ is also in the process
of replacing the aqueous film-forming foam in its
possession, and in September 2021, the U.S. Marine
Corps in Okinawa issued a press release stating that
it had completed the replacement work at all Marine
Corps facilities located in Okinawa. In addition, the
government, together with the relevant local governments
and in accordance with the supplementary Agreement on
Cooperation in the Field of Environmental Stewardship,
entered the facilities at Futenma Air Station during an
aqueous film-forming foam spill in April 2020 and at an
Army POL depot during a water spill containing PFOS
and other substances in June 2021. Furthermore, in
light of the August 2021 incident in which the U.S. side
treated water containing PFOS and other substances at
Futenma Air Station and discharged it into the public
sewage system, the MOD immediately responded,
collecting the remaining water containing PFOS and
other substances in underground water tanks in the
hangers at the air station and disposing of it. The MOD
will continue to cooperate closely with the relevant
ministries and agencies, related local governments, and
the U.S. side, and take necessary measures.

**1 Necessity of Proper Management** **2 Promotion of Proper Management**

**Proper Operation of the Information**
**Disclosure System**

Democracy, which is the most important system of
the country, is founded on the principle that the public
has access to accurate information, thereby making
appropriate judgment and exercise of sovereignty.
Administrative documents held by the government
are of the utmost importance for the public’s access to
accurate information. For this reason it is an important
responsibility for the government, including the MOD/
SDF, to manage information in an appropriate manner
and appropriately respond to the public’s information
disclosure requests.


**2 Promotion of Proper Management**
**of Public Records and Archives, and**
**Proper Operation of the Information**
**Disclosure System**

The MOD/SDF takes it seriously that the issues over
daily reports in South Sudan and Iraq brought about the
public’s distrust in the MOD/SDF.
The MOD/SDF is making full efforts to prevent
recurrence based on the “Measures for Ensuring
Appropriate Management of Public Records” (Adopted
by the Ministerial Council on the Management of
Administrative Documents and Related Matters on
July 20, 2018), which compiles measures necessary for
proper management of public records and archives by
the entire government. The MOD/SDF is also working
for proper management and response to requests for
information disclosure by reforming the awareness of
personnel and the organization culture, enhancing the
checking framework, for example.

See Reference 71 (Record of Information Disclosure by the

Ministry of Defense (FY2021))
