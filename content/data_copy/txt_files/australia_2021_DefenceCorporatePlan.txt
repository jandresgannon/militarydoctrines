## Introduction

The 2021–25 Defence Corporate Plan sets out Defence’s purpose and key activities to be achieved
covering the period 2021-25 in alignment with the requirements of the Public Governance, Performance and
_Accountability Act 2013._

Defence’s purpose and mission is: To defend Australia and its national interests in order to advance
**_Australia’s security and prosperity._**

Underpinning this purpose are two outcome statements through which we focus our portfolio resourcing and
delivery for Government, these are:

-  Defend Australia and its national interests through the conduct of operations and provision of support

for the Australian community and civilian authorities in accordance with Government direction; and

-  Protect and advance Australia’s strategic interests through the provision of strategic policy; the

development, delivery and sustainment of military, intelligence and enabling capabilities; and the
promotion of regional and global security and stability as directed by Government.

In 2021–25, we will continue to deliver significant outcomes for the Australian Government and the Australian
people, including the conduct of operations and national support tasks, enhanced defence capability, strong
partnerships with Defence industry and effective international engagement.

Performance against the 2021-25 Defence Corporate Plan will be reported through annual performance
statements, to be included in Defence Annual Reports.

The Defence Corporate Plan is a living document and will be updated at least annually to reflect changes in
our operating environment, refresh organisational priorities and ensure Defence delivers against its purpose.

Together, we are pleased to present the 2021–25 Defence Corporate Plan.

## Defence Organisation

#### Our Purpose and Mission: To defend Australia and
 its national interests in order to advance Australia’s
 security and prosperity

Defence protects and advances Australia’s strategic interests through the provision of military capabilities, to
promote security and stability, and to provide support for the Australian community and civilian authorities, as
directed by the Government.


Defence has two Outcomes:

1. _Portfolio Budget Statement 2021-22 Outcome Statement 1: Defend Australia and its national interests_

through the conduct of operations and provision of support for the Australian community and civilian
authorities in accordance with Government direction.

2. _Portfolio Budget Statement 2021-22 Outcome Statement 2: Protect and advance Australia’s strategic_

interests through the provision of strategic policy, the development, delivery and sustainment of military,
intelligence and enabling capabilities, and the promotion of regional and global security and stability as
directed by Government.

Government has directed that, in order to achieve the Defence Mission, Defence’s strategic objectives are to
**shape Australia’s strategic environment, deter actions against our interests and, when required, respond**
with credible force.

Delivery of these objectives is supported by a Defence focus on three key priorities – strategy, capability
and reform. These priorities are the pillars that support, guide and ensure agility and adaptability in Defence
culture and thinking, strategic performance, and organisational structure.

The 2020 Defence Strategic Update addresses strategy by explaining the government’s response to the
challenges Australia faces and sets out adjustments to Defence planning. The 2020 Force Structure Plan
addresses capability by detailing the government’s new and adjusted capability initiatives. Reform – the third
priority – is addressed by the Lead the Way: Defence Transformation Strategy.

_Lead the Way: Defence Transformation Strategy, released in November 2020, provides the vision and_
framework for long-term, enterprise-wide transformation to ensure Defence is organisationally fit to implement
its strategic and capability priorities and deliver on its commitments. Continuous transformation will enhance
Defence’s capacity to continually adapt as strategic circumstances change.

The Government expects Defence to play an active role in contributing to regional security and stability, and
to coalition operations around the world where our interests are engaged. Delivering on these requirements
will require Australia to build on its strong network of bilateral and multilateral relationships. Through regular
dialogue and practical cooperation, Defence is strengthening its engagement with partners to support shared
responses to shared challenges.

Capability delivery is a core business process that enables Defence to perform its mission of defending
Australia and its national interests now and into the future. Defence must procure capability efficiently and
effectively. Defence continues building the new levels of capability required by Government and described
in the 2020 Defence Strategic Update and the 2020 Force Structure Plan. Major investments will enhance


-----

Australian Defence Force capability to shape Australia’s strategic environment, to deter actions against
Australia’s interests, and to respond with credible military force, when required.

Australia’s defence industry is a major partner in the Government’s plans for current and future Defence
capabilities. It is vital that Australia maintains a science and technology base and defence industry capable of
supporting Defence’s acquisition and sustainment requirements during peacetime and operations. A highly
skilled and capable Australian defence industry is necessary for Defence to achieve its strategic objectives and
deliver large-scale, complex projects and sustain military capability. Defence will work with industry to reflect a
shared policy agenda that supports the growth and competitiveness of Australian businesses.

Defence is committed to remaining an exemplar in the Government’s response to COVID-19 and will continue
to contribute to the national effort wherever the need arises.

#### One Defence Approach

Defence is administered by a diarchy, which is the term used to describe the joint leadership of Defence by
the Secretary of Defence and the Chief of the Defence Force under the general control of the Minister for
Defence. The diarchy, which is supported by legislative and administrative arrangements, encompasses the
individual and joint responsibilities and accountabilities of the Secretary and the Chief of Defence Force, to
ensure Defence operates cohesively as one organisation, working together to meet Australian Government
requirements and achieve its purpose.

Adopting a single enterprise approach – One Defence – that recognises Defence’s interdependencies with
other organisations and communities, strengthens Defence’s ability to work effectively in support of broader
national goals.

The 2015 First Principles Review: Creating One Defence introduced a number of key foundational concepts
and recommendations that set the conditions and vision for how a high-performing and trusted Defence
organisation should operate.

Defence has made substantial changes and improvements since 2015 to its structure, governance
arrangements, accountabilities, processes and systems across the enterprise. The Lead the Way: Defence
_Transformation Strategy builds on the strong foundations of the First Principles Review, but also refocuses_
efforts to ensure that the One Defence concept is fundamentally embedded throughout the entire enterprise.
The One Defence concept is:

**“One Defence” means a unified and adaptive organisation that is driven by its**
**strategy, clearly led by its centre, and empowers its people through a culture that**
**exemplifies the Defence Values and a strong sense of shared purpose.**

**Through our work as an integrated One Defence team, we each contribute to the**
**evolution of our strategic posture, our capabilities, and delivery of the Defence**
**strategic objectives to Shape, Deter, and Respond.**

The Defence enterprise encompasses all of the Groups and Services within the Department of Defence, and
their associated people, functions and outputs. The shared outcome generated is the achievement of the
Defence Mission through the Defence strategic objectives (Shape, Deter, Respond), and the generation of the
strategic effects outlined in the classified Defence Planning Guidance.

#### IGADF Afghanistan Inquiry

The Inspector-General of the Australian Defence Force conducted an inquiry into allegations relating to
possible breaches of the Law of Armed Conflict by members of Australia’s Special Operations Task Group
in Afghanistan over the period 2005 to 2016 (the Afghanistan Inquiry). The Afghanistan Inquiry concluded on
6 November 2020 with the delivery of the report to the Chief of the Defence Force. The Afghanistan Inquiry
Reform Plan was approved by the Minister for Defence on 26 May 2021. It sets out the Defence strategy for
responding to the Afghanistan Inquiry and establishes the Afghanistan Inquiry Reform Program, which has two
objectives: address the past; and prevent recurrence.

#### Royal Commission into Defence and Veteran Suicide

On 8 July 2021, the Governor-General issued Letters Patent which established the Royal Commission into
Defence and Veteran Suicide (the Royal Commission). Mr Nick Kaldas APM (Chair), The Hon James Douglas
QC and Dr Peggy Brown AO were appointed as Commissioners. Defence has established a Taskforce that
will support Defence’s contribution to the work of the Royal Commission. The Royal Commission is required
to produce an interim report by 11 August 2022 and a final report by 15 June 2023. Defence will cooperate
fully with the Royal Commission and is working closely with the Department of Veterans’ Affairs on the shared
goal of preventing suicide among current and former serving members of the Australian Defence Force. The
National Commissioner for Defence and Veteran Suicide Prevention Bill, will be amended to ensure that the
National Commissioner will be well placed to perform its forward-looking role and support the prevention of
future deaths by suicide, following the conclusion of the Royal Commission or as recommended by the Royal
Commission.

#### Sovereign Guided Weapons and Explosive Ordnance Enterprise

On 31 March 2021 the Prime Minister, the Minister for Defence, the Minister for Defence Industry and the
Minister for Industry Science and Technology announced the Australian Government will accelerate the
creation of a Sovereign Guided Weapons and Explosive Ordnance Enterprise.

The Sovereign Guided Weapons and Explosive Ordnance Enterprise is the enabling ecosystem necessary
to deliver Guided Weapons and Explosive Ordnance preparedness and improve supply chain resilience. The
Sovereign Guided Weapons and Explosive Ordnance Enterprise will be a dynamic organisational construct
that spans Government, Defence, Industry and academia and will be a strategic enabler of Sovereign Guided
Weapon and Explosive Ordnance capability.

Defence is undertaking a program of work to expand relationships with allied governments and understand
the capacity and capability of Australian Industry and academia to develop and operate an integrated
Sovereign Guided Weapons and Explosive Ordnance Enterprise.

## Achieving Defence’s Purpose and Mission

#### Outcome 1:

 Defend Australia and its national interests through the conduct of operations and provision of support for the Australian community and civilian authorities in accordance with Government direction.

 Operations

The Government expects Defence to be a proactive force for stability, security and sovereignty in our
immediate region. It also expects Defence to deploy military power to achieve Defence’s strategic objectives
of shaping Australia’s strategic environment, deterring actions against our interests and, when required,
responding with credible military force. Defence will achieve this by strengthening existing and building new
partnerships, conducting cooperation activities, and where our interests are engaged contributing to coalition
operations around the world.

To that end the Government deploys Defence personnel to operations overseas and within Australia to protect
Australia and advance its strategic interests. The Defence enterprise is also called upon to provide support to
the Australian community and civil authorities within Australia as directed by Government. National security
is a whole-of-government commitment, which requires Defence to work with other security agencies, both
across government and internationally, to ensure strategic objectives are achieved. Regional capacity building
and protection of Australia’s borders and offshore maritime interests remains a high priority for Defence. In
particular, supporting State readiness to respond to natural disasters and domestic events of violence through
various counter-terrorism activities. Figure 2 identifies Australian Defence Force operations as at 1 June 2021.

#### National Security Support Tasks

Defence also supports the Commonwealth and State/Territory Governments with emergency and non-
emergency tasks, as well as supporting events of national significance as requested by the Government.

The Government and the Australian public expect Defence to respond to significant domestic crises. This
expectation will continue over the life of this Corporate Plan, particularly in the context of ongoing and
uncertain impacts of COVID-19.

The lessons learned from recent national security support tasks such as Operation BUSHFIRE ASSIST 2019-
2020 and Operation COVID-19 ASSIST will be implemented to ensure that Defence strengthens and supports
the interdependencies with other Commonwealth, State and Territory authorities, industry and international
security agencies. These developments will better enable Defence to work in an engaged, agile, adaptive and
aligned manner to achieve broader national goals that support national resilience and deliver maximum value
to the nation.

#### Outcome 2:

 Protect and advance Australia’s strategic interests through the provision of strategic policy, the development, delivery and sustainment of military, intelligence and enabling capabilities, and the promotion of regional and global security and stability as directed by Government.

 Setting Strategic Direction

The 2020 Defence Strategic Update and 2020 Force Structure Plan, released on 1 July 2020, outline a new
strategy for Defence and the capability investments to deliver it.

The 2020 Defence Strategic Update sets out the challenges in Australia’s rapidly evolving strategic
environment and their implications for Defence planning. It sets out the Government’s new strategic Defence
policy framework, which clearly identifies geographical, operational and capability priorities and provides a
tight focus for planning, and alignment with broader Government initiatives such as the Pacific Step-up and
efforts to build a secure, prosperous and inclusive Indo-Pacific of independent, sovereign and resilient states.

The 2020 Defence Strategic Update replaces the Strategic Defence Framework set out in the 2016 Defence
_White Paper with three new strategic objectives which will guide all aspects of Defence’s planning including_
force structure planning, force generation, international engagement and operations. These new objectives
are:

-  to shape Australia’s strategic environment;

-  to deter actions against Australia’s interests; and

-  to respond with credible military force, when required.

The 2020 Force Structure Plan details the Government’s intentions for new and adjusted Australian Defence
Force capability investments to implement the 2020 Defence Strategic Update’s new objectives, Defence will:

-  prioritise our immediate region (the north-eastern Indian Ocean, through maritime and mainland

South East Asia to Papua New Guinea and the South West Pacific) for the Australian Defence Force’s
geographical focus;

-  grow the Australian Defence Force’s self-reliance for delivering deterrent effects;

-  expand Defence’s capability to respond to grey-zone activities, working closely with other arms of

Government;

-  enhance the lethality of the Australian Defence Force for the sorts of high-intensity operations that are

the most likely and highest priority in relation to Australia’s security;

-  maintain the Australian Defence Force’s ability to deploy forces globally where the Government chooses

to do so, including in the context of US-led coalitions; and

-  enhance Defence’s capacity to support civil authorities in response to natural disasters and crises.

The Defence Corporate Plan is Defence’s principal public planning document to assure Government and
the Australian people that strategy, capability and resources are aligned to the highest priorities in achieving
Defence’s purpose and the strategic objectives within the 2020 Defence Strategic Update. A defence force
that can meet the challenges of the future requires the generation, integration and sustainment of Defence
capability across multiple decades. That requirement is balanced with the need to be agile and responsive to
Government direction to address emerging threats within changing environments and evolving geopolitical
and technological dynamics. A more proactive posture for Defence is desirable to strengthen our relationships
with countries across the region to address security challenges; and proactively preventing security challenges
from escalating by shaping the regional environment.


-----

To remain agile and adaptive to the evolving strategic environment Defence undertakes a strategic risk
review cycle that continuously scans the strategic environment to inform risk mitigation, including through the
Department’s highest level classified planning document, the Defence Planning Guidance.

The Defence Planning Guidance provides the classified guidance and direction to Defence to implement the
Government’s direction. It informs strategy, policy, direction, business plans and strategic workforce plans. It
also informs the implementation of the Integrated Investment Program and Defence Industry Policy Statement,
and is a key input to contingency planning. The Defence Strategic Policy Committee endorses the Defence
_Planning Guidance annually._

The strategic, complex and multi-layered nature of planning within Defence is demonstrated by Figure 3.
It should be noted that this does not include all documents and that there are classified environments and
systems in place designed to ensure planning, resourcing, prioritisation, risk management and delivery is
aligned with Government direction and the Secretary and the Chief of the Defence Force’s strategic priorities.

#### International Engagement and Cooperation

Cooperation with international partners is crucial for Defence to meet our strategic objectives. The hard and
soft power that give us influence internationally are key to navigating Australia’s increasingly complex strategic
environment. Australia benefits from well-developed international defence partnerships with our allies and
other key partners to complement whole-of-government efforts to shape our region so it supports our security
and prosperity. Defence international engagement, an integrated core function across the entire Defence
portfolio, reduces the risk of military confrontation, builds interoperability with key partners and improves the
coordination of responses to shared international challenges including terrorism, humanitarian assistance and
disaster relief.

#### Defence Industry

A strong sovereign defence industrial base is an expression of our national power and supports our ability to
meet the challenges of the changing strategic environment. Defence continues to deliver on the Government’s
commitment to develop a robust, resilient and internationally competitive Australian defence industry base that
is better able to support defence capability requirements.

The Australian Industry Capability Program is maximising opportunities for Australian industry participation in
Defence capability planning and procurement. A strong exporting defence industry and enhanced technology
and industrial base collaboration with likeminded partners supports the sustainment and growth of our
sovereign industry, increases Australia’s economic prosperity and strengthens Australia’s influence on the
world stage.

The Sovereign Industrial Capability Priorities guide Defence procurement to build and strengthen the critical
capabilities required of Australia’s defence industry to achieve our strategic objectives. Implementation and
Industry Plans for eight of the initial ten Priorities were released in 2020, with the remaining two to be released
in 2021. Defence regularly assesses new and emerging capabilities through a rigorous assessment framework
to ensure the Priorities capture future strategic opportunities and threats, and continue to support progress in
Australia’s sovereign defence industry.

Through the Defence Innovation Hub, Defence is continuing to harness the innovative potential of Australia’s
defence industry and innovation sector to deliver advanced capabilities for Defence. This is helping expand
the capability and capacity of Australia’s defence industrial base.

#### Defence Intelligence

Defence intelligence delivers high-quality and timely intelligence services that achieve Government intelligence
priorities.

To ensure Defence intelligence functions as an enterprise; is optimised to support the breadth of Defence
activities; and is able to take advantage of the emergence of advanced and disruptive technologies, Defence
has brought together its intelligence enterprise capabilities under a new Chief of Defence Intelligence and
Defence Intelligence Group.

The Defence Intelligence Group includes Australian Defence Force and Australian Public Service functions,
including the Defence Intelligence Organisation, the Australian Geospatial Intelligence Organisation, and other
critical intelligence components from the former Strategic Policy and Intelligence Group, and Joint Capabilities
Group. Chief Defence Intelligence also has a number of other enterprise responsibilities including the training of
intelligence professionals across the Defence workforce, and the management of intelligence capability projects.

As a result of these reforms, Defence intelligence will be positioned to effectively contribute to the national
intelligence architecture; optimise Defence’s future advanced capabilities to support Australian Defence Force
operations and national intelligence roles; and provide effective, sustained intelligence support to current and
future Australian Defence Force operations.

#### Designing Defence Capability

Preparing the Future Force

The 2020 Force Structure Plan is an enterprise level activity for Defence. The 2020 Force Structure Plan outlines
the intention for new and adjusted Australian Defence Force capability investments to implement the strategic
objectives of the 2020 Defence Strategic Update. This is achieved through consideration of the planned
investment profile in the context of changes in the evolving strategic environment and emergent technologies.
The objective of the 2020 Force Structure Plan is to set the direction of the Australian Defence Force’s force
structure to ensure it is capable of undertaking the tasks Government expects out to 2040.

As part of the 2020 Defence Strategic Update and 2020 Force Structure Plan, the Government made
adjustments to Defence capability investment plans to ensure the Australian Defence Force can shape
Australia’s strategic environment; deter actions against Australia’s interests; and respond with credible military
force, when required.

Defence, as a key element of national power and influence, must be agile and responsive to deliver the priorities
of Government. Defence capabilities are an important part of a whole-of-government strategic effect, which also
includes academia, defence industry and international partners in the delivery of national security outcomes.

A joint force that is capable, relevant and potent in achieving the strategic Defence objectives directed by the
Government requires a flexible and scalable force design process. Informed through analysis of Government
strategic guidance, the Defence Planning Guidance and strategic risk review process, Defence assesses
emerging gaps and opportunities; develops and tests operating concepts; and proposes force structures and
capability options that enhance and enable the joint force.

Defence will continue to design, develop and integrate capability to provide the Government with options
to mitigate strategic national security risks. This includes Defence’s ability to respond and conduct military
operations and provide civil aid and humanitarian assistance in multiple domains as a joint force, bringing
together land, air, sea, intelligence, electronic warfare, space, information (including cyber) and personnel
capability. Defence is working to integrate the technical, organisational, security and cultural aspects of our
business to deliver cohesive military effects across a joint warfighting domain. Defence capability is supported
by an enduring partnership with the Australian defence industry to not only meet the Australian Defence Force’s
capability needs for today, but to also respond to changes in our future strategic environment. Developing an
Australian industrial base with the capability, posture and resilience to meet future Defence capability needs
remains a long-term endeavour and will remain a focus over the life of this and subsequent Corporate Plans.

#### Innovation, Science and Technology

Defence innovation, science and technology play a critical role in Australia’s defence and national security
by ensuring our forces maintain a capability edge. Defence’s strategic research is aligned to future force
requirements and focuses on the development of leap ahead capabilities for Defence and maximising the
opportunities created by emerging and future technologies. Its primary strategic research mechanisms are the
Next Generation Technologies Fund and the Science, Technology and Research Shots introduced as part of
_More, together: Defence Science and Technology Strategy 2030._

To realise the benefits of innovation, science and technology, Defence is continuing to shape and lead the
Defence Capability Innovation System, to drive the evolution of innovation pathways and harness the national

for current and future industry and research partners as to how they can contribute and deliver innovative
capabilities into Defence. This includes facilitating a coordinated approach across the spectrum of potentially
high payoff research through to relatively lower risk incremental innovation.

Capability Managers in Defence are responsible for managing component capabilities in accordance with the
_Chief of the Defence Force’s Preparedness Directive to deliver leading edge defence capabilities that provide_
strategic advantage and avoid strategic surprise, supported by delivery and enabler Groups. These are
integrated into the current and future joint force.

Working closely with partners across the Defence enterprise, defence industry and Coalition Forces; Defence
capabilities are introduced into service, sustained with agreed enhancements, and removed from service via
retirement or replacement, as part of the Capability Life Cycle.

Defence is committed to sustaining capability though maintaining security, health, education and training
programs to support exercises and operations.

#### Acquiring Capability

Defence has one of the largest capital investment programs in the Commonwealth, consisting primarily of
acquisition, sustainment and support of Defence capabilities. The Integrated Investment Program includes
all capital and related investments (such as materiel, estate and facilities, workforce and information and
communications technology).

The Integrated Investment Program is reviewed annually to address strategic changes and emerging
technologies and priorities. Under the 2020 Force Structure Plan, a comprehensive assessment of the
Australian Defence Force’s force structure and current and future Defence capability investments has been
conducted. This assessment focussed on meeting the strategic guidance set out in the 2020 Defence
_Strategic Update, responding to a changing strategic context, new technologies and supporting ongoing_
modernisation of Defence over a 20 year timeframe.

The 2020 Force Structure Plan makes necessary adjustments to Defence capability investments set out in
the 2016 Defence White Paper and the Integrated Investment Program to ensure capability, resources and
strategy remain aligned.

Defence capability investment decision-making is supported by an arms-length contestability function that
forms a core element of the Defence decision support framework to ensure that investment proposals are
aligned with strategy and resources.

The 2020 Force Structure Plan and the Integrated Investment Program will continue to support the acquisition
and sustainment of Defence capability to meet the challenges of the future operating environment.

Progress continues to be made in building a strong and sustainable sovereign naval shipbuilding enterprise.
This is a Defence-led but whole-of-government activity being implemented under the Government’s
_2017 Naval Shipbuilding Plan. The key elements of the enterprise are now in place with the Attack class_
submarine in its design phase, Hunter class frigate commencing prototyping and the Arafura class offshore
patrol vessel and Guardian class patrol boat programs in build. Six new evolved Cape class patrol boats,
the first of the new programs described in the 2020 Force Structure Plan, are also now under construction.
New world class shipbuilding facilities at Osborne South in South Australia and Henderson in Western
Australia are now in place. A new shipyard at Osborne North for the Attack class submarine build is under
construction. The naval sustainment element of the enterprise continues to meet or exceed Navy’s readiness
requirements and is supporting significant upgrade programs across the Hobart, ANZAC and Collins class
fleets. Defence industry continues to play a critical and growing part in delivering the enterprise which will
be further emphasised in the release of the Sovereign Industrial Capability Priority Plans for Continuous
Naval Shipbuilding and Collins Class Sustainment Collective with an update to the Naval Shipbuilding and
Sustainment Plan due out later in 2021.

#### A High Performing One Defence Enterprise

Enterprise Transformation

Defence, as a matter of necessity, must continue to improve its ability to deliver on its current commitments
while retaining the organisational capacity to anticipate and respond effectively to strategic challenges.
Just as Defence raises, trains and sustains military capabilities and uniformed people, it must also ensure
its enterprise can always adapt to a changing strategic environment. This requires a high-performing One
Defence enterprise with a culture that embraces continuous improvement.

To achieve this, Defence must retain the ability to:

-  Learn about its environment, risks, opportunities and performance.

-  Evolve how it operates as an enterprise, supports and develops its people and deepens its

partnerships.

-  Align its priorities, processes, systems and communications.

-  Deliver the Defence Mission and strategic effects through its capabilities, services and by clearly

demonstrating value to the Nation.

Continuous transformation will enhance Defence’s capacity to adapt as strategic circumstances change.
_Lead the Way: Defence Transformation Strategy provides the vision and framework for long-term enterprise-_
wide transformation, with key activities updated annually through the Enterprise Priority Statement. The
delivery and embedding of this framework is occurring through three sets of initiatives, with an implementation
period to the end of 2022. These are:

1. A continuous improvement culture

2. An enduring transformation system

3. Priority reform areas of focus

A key initiative under a continuous improvement culture was the development of a whole-of-enterprise Data
Strategy, in recognition that the effective use and management of data is critical to everything Defence does.
On 4 August, the Assistant Minister for Defence, The Honourable Andrew Hastie MP launched the Defence
Data Strategy 2021-2023. The Defence Data Strategy demonstrates the investment in data capability within
the Defence workforce. Implementing the Strategy will fundamentally change the way Defence manages and
works with data, building strong data literacy and analytic skillsets, in order to deliver strategic and operational
advantage.

Workforce

Defence requires a highly skilled workforce to deliver the capabilities and investments outlined in the
_2020 Force Structure Plan. The workforce must also have the agility to respond to the needs of Government_
in ways that have been demonstrated recently during Operation BUSHFIRE ASSIST 2019-2020 and the
COVID-19 pandemic response. Our people require well-developed cultural competencies to enhance
our effectiveness when working with our allied partners, our regional neighbours and civilian populations.
Underpinning all of this is the requirement for our people to demonstrate Defence’s Values and Behaviours to
create a high performing, diverse and inclusive workforce.

Linked to the Lead the Way: Defence Transformation Strategy, Defence will deliver a comprehensive reform of
its Human Resources and Education and Training operating model to ensure that it better supports the One
_Defence operating model, the strong strategic centre, and the generation of joint capabilities. This reform of_
the Human Resources and Education and Training operating model will be informed by a refreshed Defence
Strategic Workforce Plan (to be delivered in the second half of 2021) and the Defence Enterprise Learning
Strategy, and will be closely tied to the delivery of the Enterprise Resource Planning program.

To meet the future workforce requirements Defence will:

-  Continue to embed the Total Workforce System, which will allow Defence to access the full potential of

the entire Australian Defence Force workforce through varying levels of full-time and part-time service,
and access to a contingent workforce;

-  Improve engagement and collaboration with industry, academia and other government agencies; and

-  Invest in the education, training and continuous development of our people to deliver future capabilities

and sustain an intellectual edge.


-----

Defence Culture

Defence’s culture is fundamental to achieving our mission. It drives our attractiveness as an employer and our
capacity to meet future demands.

The Lead the Way: Defence Transformation Strategy adopts a single enterprise approach that recognises
the importance of the Defence Values and Behaviours to lead the way on how the organisation continues to
create a high performing, diverse and inclusive workforce, and meet the expectations of all Australians.

Successful implementation of the Lead the Way: Defence Transformation Strategy will require and reinforce a
culture of continuous improvement in Defence. This will be delivered through three key elements:

-  Defence Values and Behaviours;

-  Clear Accountabilities; and

-  Trusted Information.

Cultural reform within Defence has been ongoing through its commitment to Pathway to Change: Evolving
_Defence Culture 2017-2022. Defence, as a matter of necessity, must continue to enhance its culture to_
respond to its capability priorities and strategic challenges.

All Defence personnel are accountable for a more positive and inclusive culture, defined through a set of
unifying Values and Behaviours.

The Values and Behaviours, launched in October 2020, are part of a series of objectives to drive the
One Defence ethos.

The Values articulate Defence’s character in achieving its mission. The Values are:

-  Service – The selflessness of character to place the security and interests of our nation ahead

of my own.

-  Courage – The strength of character to say and do the right thing, always, especially in the


face of adversity.

-  Respect – The humanity of character to value others and treat them with dignity.

-  Integrity – The consistency of character to align my thoughts, words and actions to do what is right.

-  Excellence – The willingness of character to strive each day to be the best I can be, both professionally

and personally.

The corresponding Behaviours to the Values have been developed to guide our people to actively
improve and transform how we work and interact together to deliver authentic, sustainable organisational
performance. The Behaviours are:

-  I will act with purpose for Defence and the nation

-  I will be adaptable, innovative and agile

-  I will collaborate and be team-focused

-  I will be accountable and trustworthy

-  I will reflect, learn and improve

-  I will be inclusive and value others.

#### Assurance and Controls

Defence continues to mature its control functions (financial management, risk management, internal audit,
inspector general and judge advocate), to provide assurance to Enterprise Committees that Governmentdirected outcomes are being delivered in accordance with legislative and policy requirements.

Key responsible and accountable officers will work together to ensure that enterprise financial management,
corporate planning and performance management are aligned to support Defence senior leadership and
comply with the Public Governance, Performance and Accountability Act 2013.

Under the Enterprise Committee Governance Framework, the Defence Audit and Risk Committee’s role is to
review and provide written advice to the Secretary and the Chief of the Defence Force on the appropriateness
of Defence’s financial reporting, performance reporting, system of risk oversight and management, and the
system of internal control.

Effective financial management ensures Defence uses Government-allocated resources to deliver
Government-directed outcomes in accordance with the Public Governance, Performance and
_Accountability Act 2013. The Chief Finance Officer has responsibility for ensuring appropriate financial_
governance within Defence.

Defence’s financial stewardship is being enhanced to deliver a robust and strategic finance function that
transitions Defence towards a more contemporary financial management approach. This will provide focus
on process improvement, automation of transactional services, and building financial management capability
across Defence. It will better balance control and assurance activities with a client-focused business
partnering approach to financial management. This integration will facilitate effective communication to
understand and connect to internal and external stakeholder requirements; and provide integrated controls for
managing risks, supporting continued success in achieving compliance obligations.

In accordance with the Public Governance, Performance and Accountability Act 2013, and in support of the
_Commonwealth Fraud Control Framework, Defence has instituted the Defence Fraud and Corruption Control_
_Plan, which describes the fraud control framework to prevent, detect and respond to fraud. A focus of the_
_Defence Fraud and Corruption Control Plan is to develop our capacity to identify and manage enterprise-wide_
vulnerabilities and risk factors within a diverse operating environment.

#### Defence’s Legal Framework

Defence Legal enables Defence to operate lawfully in its mission to defend Australia and its national interests.
Defence Legal does this by providing legal services to the various Groups and Services in Defence, including
through lawyers embedded in Defence areas.

Defence Legal is committed to continuous improvement in line with Lead the Way: Defence Transformation
_Strategy to support Defence’s ability to be agile, proactive and effective. Defence Legal is scoping its legal_
framework to identify areas suitable for reform to ensure the organisation remains fit for purpose to deliver
government priorities in Australia. Defence Legal is also evaluating its workforce structure to ensure effective
and efficient delivery of legal services.

The Defence Act 1903 sets outs the framework for the command and administration of Defence. The Chief
of the Defence Force commands the Australian Defence Force, while the Chief of the Defence Force and the
Secretary have joint responsibility for administration of the Australian Defence Force.

The Secretary has all the rights, duties and powers of an agency head under the Public Service Act 1999,
and is accountable for the Department and the Australian Defence Force under the Public Governance,
_Performance and Accountability Act 2013._


-----

The Chief Counsel is accountable to the Secretary and the Chief of the Defence Force for the provision,
procurement and coordination of legal services across Defence, subject to the Legal Services Directions
_2017, issued from time to time by the Attorney-General, including:_

-  the provision of effective and efficient legal service delivery (including the required policy framework);

-  the establishment of standards and monitoring of service delivery performance for the legal services

shared service function;

-  ensuring commanders and line managers receive the legal support they require to fulfil their

accountabilities and deliver capability; and

-  developing and maintaining a legal risk framework to assist commanders and line managers with the

ongoing assessment and management of legal risks, and reporting to the Defence leadership and
ministers in the Defence portfolio.

#### Enterprise Risk Management

Risk management is an essential element in Defence’s framework of good governance and informs decisions
at all levels of the organisation. Effective risk management enables and supports innovation, the development
of new ways of working and the proper use of public resources to achieve Defence outcomes.

Defence recognises that risk is inherent in its work and can present both opportunities and threats to the
achievement of outcomes. Taking calculated risks when prudent to do so allows Defence to identify and
address issues that might otherwise jeopardise capability and credibility.

Defence’s risk appetite and tolerance is influenced by the nature of activities, emerging priorities and an
evolving environment. Due to the nature and complexity of the operating environment, higher levels of risk may
need to be managed.

The Defence risk management system ensures that we are able to meet risk management obligations in
accordance with the Public Governance, Performance and Accountability Act 2013 and the Commonwealth
_Risk Management Policy._

Defence’s principle based Risk Management Policy outlines our approach to managing risk, including
Defence risk appetite, risk management expectations, accountabilities and responsibilities. All personnel
are encouraged to engage positively and responsibly in managing risk, including complying with legislation,
policies and delegations.

Defence strategic, enterprise, operational and specialist risks are monitored and managed by relevant
business areas and significant risk is analysed and reported to inform risk-based decisions at the
enterprise-level.

Defence assesses Australia’s strategic environment to identify potential strategic risks that could impact
Defence and may result in updates to Defence policy, strategic guidance, or force posture. Strategic risks may
be managed as shared risks with other Commonwealth agencies/entities, international and industry partners.

Enterprise risks are concerned with the operations of the organisation and are risks to the implementation of
government decisions and achievement of Defence’s required outcomes. Defence groups its enterprise risks
into ten categories of enterprise risk to the achievement of the Defence Corporate Plan (Table 1).

The Defence enterprise risk management approach and its effectiveness is overseen by the Enterprise
Business Committee and the Defence Audit and Risk Committee, supported by Enterprise Risk Stewards.

Through the Strategy Framework, Defence regularly reviews its planning to ensure the alignment of strategy,
capability and resources in ways that are responsive to enhanced understanding of the risks associated
with the evolving strategic environment. Defence will continue to review and update its approach to how we
assess, treat and report on Defence’s risk management arrangements. In particular, Defence’s enterprise risk
management must harmonise with our strategic risk arrangements to ensure that we are allocating resources
and effort in addressing Defence and Government’s highest priorities.
