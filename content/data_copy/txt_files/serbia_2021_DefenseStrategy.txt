# Introduction

Defence is a function of the state to ensure the protection and pursuit of its defence interests. Our defence interests represent an expression of the highest values and general needs of the citizens1 and the Republic of Serbia for building and preserving security and stability as essential prerequisites for free and democratic development of the society. They spring from universal values of the civilised world, national values, capabilities of the Republic of Serbia and its position in the international relations.

While protecting its defence interests, the Republic of Serbia at the same time creates necessary preconditions for the protection of all other national interests, as well as for active participation in the protection of common values with other states. The protection and pursuit of our defence interests is the general objective and purpose of the existence and operation of the defence system.

The Defence Strategy of the Republic of Serbia2, hereinafter referred to as the "Defence Strategy", is based on the Constitution of the Republic of Serbia and the National Security Strategy of the Republic of Serbia. It is 

1 The terms used in this document, with meaning of gender, refer to both masculine and feminine gender.

2 Pursuant to Article 9 paragraph 2(2) of the Law on Defence ("Official Gazette of the Republic of Serbia", No. 116/07, 88/09, 88/09 - as amended, 104/09 - as amended, 10/15 and 36/18) and Article 8(1) of the Law on National Assembly ("Official Gazette of the Republic of Serbia", No. 9/10), the National Assembly of the Republic of Serbia, at its Tenth Sitting of the Second Regular Session in the year 2019, held on 27th December 2019, adopted the Defence Strategy of the Republic of Serbia that was published in the "Official Gazette of the Republic of Serbia", No. 94/19. On the date of the publishing of this Strategy, the Decision on adopting the Defence Strategy of the Republic of Serbia ("Official Gazette of the Republic of Serbia", No. 88/09) shall cease to be valid.
the basic strategic document that directs the development of normative, doctrinal and organisational solutions of the defence system, planning and financing of defence, and engagement of defence resources of the Republic of Serbia.

The Defence Strategy analyses the security environment from the aspect of defence of the Republic of Serbia, identifies security challenges, risks and threats relevant to defence, formulates defence interests and goals, determines the defence policy, structure, management and the principles of functioning of the defence system of the Republic of Serbia. 

The commitments stated in the Defence Strategy express the determination of the Republic of Serbia, in accordance with the decision on military neutrality, to build and strengthen its own defence capabilities and capacities, as well as to contribute to strengthening national, regional and global security through cooperation with the European Union's security and defence actors, participation in the Partnership for Peace Programme, cooperation with the Collective Security Treaty Organisation and other international security and defence actors.

The Defence Strategy reaffirms the adherence of the Republic of Serbia to the generally accepted standards of defence organisation of democratic societie.

# 1. Security Environment

The complexity and dynamics of international relations, international security integration, as well as the increased instability and unpredictability in the world are the main features of the security environment and key parameters in the process of finding the appropriate model of security and defence organisation of contemporary societies.

The intensification of political, economic and cultural cooperation and interdependence of states, as well as integration processes in the field of security, are important prerequisites for the promotion of peace and stability globally and reducing the risk of traditional military threats. 

War and armed conflicts are still present in international relations. 

Terrorism, organised crime, ethnic and religious extremism, irregular migration, hybrid threats, competition for access to natural resources, climate change and the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction, as a dynamic set of security challenges, risks and threats in many countries and regions of the world, are the key factors in the process of finding an appropriate model of security and defence organisation of states.

Interventionism in sovereign states, without the approval of the United Nations, disrupts the international legal order and poses a serious threat to global peace and stability. Some states' recognition of new pseudostate entities created in the territories of sovereign states, members of the United Nations, is an act which encourages secessionism and ethnic-based conflicts, thus threatening peace and security in the region and world.

A degree of development of national economies is reflected in the ability of states to independently provide adequate defence capabilities and capacities. Such circumstances increase the importance of states' readiness to enhance national capabilities and exert a favourable influence 

on the global security situation, through appropriate international military cooperation, participation in international security and defence integration and multinational operations, through concluding and implementing international agreements and conventions, as well as through military-economic cooperation. 

It is estimated that the number of conflicts caused by competition for the provision of energy and other natural resources, drinking water and food in the world will increase. In such circumstances, the priorities of the great powers will be to provide access to energy resources and control oil and gas flows, which is why new tensions and crises can be expected in the regions that are important in this respect. 

The long lasting conflicts in the Middle East, central Asia and Africa have driven the escalation of terrorism and migrant crisis, creating security and political problems that will, in the long run, due to their complexity, pose key global risks. 

The transnational and asymmetrical character of contemporary security challenges, risks and threats indicates the indivisibility of international security and influences the strengthening of defence and security cooperation. The basis for cooperation is the dialogue, partnership and common action of states and other actors involved in international relations for the purpose of achieving, maintaining and improving security. Such a concept implies concerted activities in the areas of politics, economy, security and defence, and it is an important contribution to strengthening peace and stability in the world.

The promotion of the values of democracy, socio-economic stability, as well as the security and defence cooperation of the actors involved in international relations will have a positive impact on the security of the European continent. Notwithstanding positive trends and results achieved, the security situation in some regions of Europe has not been fully stabilised, nor have the dangers of crisis and armed conflict been eliminated.

The active involvement of the United Nations, European Union, North Atlantic Treaty Organisation (NATO), Organisation for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE) and their ability to respond to current security challenges, risks and threats will continue to have a significant impact on the security situation in Europe. 

The United Nations Organisation is an important factor in addressing issues related to world peace.

Particularly important for strengthening regional security is the Partnership for Peace Programme, which enables political, security and defence cooperation between NATO Members and Partners, on the principles of voluntarism and individual opting for activities, in accordance with their own priorities.

The European Union's Common Security and Defence Policy (CSDP) 
continues to play an important role in crisis management and stabilisation of the situation in the areas of interest for the European Union. The activities of the Collective Security Treaty Organisation (CSTO) significantly contribute to the preservation and enhancement of the security of Eurasian region, while, at the same time, they aim at countering global challenges and threats, such as terrorism and drug trafficking. 

The problems of European security and defence are particularly pronounced in the region of South East Europe, whose geostrategic and geopolitical significance, in conjunction with numerous complex risks and threats to security and defence, may be the cause of regional and international crises. First of all, the security situation in the region is threatened by attempts at imposing illegal changes of the internationally recognised borders of the Republic of Serbia through the process of resolving the status of the Autonomous Province of Kosovo and Metohija, as well as greater state projects of certain states which provoke tensions in the neighbouring countries. 

The recognition of the unlawfully and unilaterally declared independence of the territory administratively covered by the Autonomous Province of Kosovo and Metohija by the neighbouring states of the Republic of Serbia as well as by the states across the region and worldwide reflects negatively on mutual confidence and cooperation, and slows down the process of security stabilisation in this region.

16 Separatist aspirations, ethnic and religious tensions, tendencies to abolish the Dayton Agreement and Republika Srpska, threatening the position of the Serbian people, terrorism, organised crime, irregular migration, drug trafficking, human trafficking, corruption, natural and technical and technological disasters, cyber-attacks on critical infrastructure facilities, and the spread of fake news and misinformation within the concept of hybrid and information warfare are real threats to regional security. An inadequate resolution of the issues of the return of refugees, expelled and internally displaced persons and of their property, prosecution of war crimes, and the issues of missing persons additionally slow down the process of stabilisation of the situation in the Balkans.

Peace and stability are important preconditions for the participation of the states of South East Europe in EU integration. Therefore, the states of South East Europe are oriented towards making joint efforts in countering the negative processes that threaten their national interests. The regional states are committed to continuing the reform of their defence systems in order to adapt to modern defence standards, to develop military capabilities and capacities, and to modernise arms and military equipment.

Regional security initiatives are especially important for the consolidation of peace and stability in the South East Europe region. Involving the South East Europe countries in the work of these initiatives, institutionalisation of their action and development of bilateral relations significantly contribute to building cooperation and confidence, and thus the security in the region.

The technological modernisation of the armed forces will have a significant impact on the physiognomy and course of future armed conflicts and will greatly contribute to the attainment of capabilities necessary to counter security threats.

The Republic of Serbia builds necessary capabilities and capacities for the defence and protection of our national and defence interests and contributes to the preservation of peace and development of a favourable security environment, along with improving relations with the institutions of the collective security system, neighbouring and other countries. The defence policy of the Republic of Serbia is defined and implemented in accordance with international law and internationally undertaken obligations, and is aimed at achieving the development of society and strengthening national security. 

The enhancement of international cooperation in the field of defence, as a powerful instrument to promote the results of reform processes, build and improve partnership relations with a large number of states and armed forces, contributes to the protection of our defence interests and the attainment of defence policy goals and it significantly supports the Serbian foreign policy.

With the adoption of the Resolution on the Protection of Sovereignty, Territorial Integrity and Constitutional Order, the Republic of Serbia declared its military neutrality in relation to the existing military alliances, expressing its commitment to independent creation of its own defence policy. At the same time, it is involved in the implementation of the EU Common Security and Defence Policy, and it participates in the Partnership for Peace Programme, and it cooperates with the Collective Security Treaty Organisation and, as a member of the United Nations, it actively contributes to building and maintenance of international peace and security outside of its borders.

By participating in multinational operations under the mandate of the United Nations and the European Union crisis management operations, the Republic of Serbia contributes to fulfilling the function of the defence of the country, strengthening its position in international relations and protecting the universal values of the international order, such as human rights, democracy and the rule of law. 

The Republic of Serbia is committed, as a militarily neutral state, to continued strengthening of its defence capabilities and developing its own defence industry, an efficient and economically sustainable defence system, professional and efficient military capabilities in accordance with the missions and tasks of the Serbian Armed Forces, transparency of defence operations and appropriate civil-military relations, as well as to continued ensuring and strengthening the democratic control in the field of defence.

18 The scientific and technological development of the Republic of Serbia and joint projects with other countries and international organisations will have a positive impact on the defence potentials, strengthening the domestic defence industry and expanding the market. It is particularly important to ensure the development of the capabilities and potentials of the defence industry in the field of research and development of arms and military equipment, with a view to establishing proper technological basis for the defence system, as well as the placement of domestic defence industry products to markets in Europe and worldwide. 

In accordance with its national and defence interests and in accordance with United Nations Security Council Resolution 1244 and the Military Technical Agreement between the International Security Forces (KFOR) and the governments of the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia and the Republic of Serbia, the Republic of Serbia strongly opposes the efforts of the Provisional Institutions of Self-Government in Priština for the Autonomous Province of Kosovo and Metohija to receive international recognition as an independent state, as well as the transformation of the armed formations so-called "Kosovo Security Forces" into armed forces. 

Being the primary responsible structure for the defence of the country, the Serbian Armed Forces will continue to develop and improve capabilities for the protection of the defence interests of the Republic of Serbia, based on the established defence policy and the assigned missions and tasks.

In the context of the existing interdependence and unpredictability in the world, the main characteristic of the modern strategic environment, from the aspect of security and defence, are complex challenges, risks and threats that, in certain circumstances, can threaten the defence of any country, regardless of its size, strength, international position, membership of international organisations and politico-military alliances.

The Defence Strategy sets out various challenges, risks and threats to the defence of the Republic of Serbia that are subject to change, bearing in mind that they arise from the current situation in the security environment.

# 2. Security Challenges, Risks And Threats Relevant To Defence

The Republic of Serbia is committed, as a militarily neutral state, to constantly improving its defence system in order to be able to effectively respond to defence challenges, risks and threats. Although current security challenges, risks and threats relevant to defence of the Republic of Serbia are manifested in a complex environment and depend on external and internal factors, it is important that each of them is analysed separately. In accordance with the severity of the effects which they may cause, the following challenges, risks and threats to security that are relevant to defence of the Republic of Serbia have been identified: armed aggression, unlawfully and unilaterally declared independence of the territory administratively covered by the Autonomous Province of Kosovo and Metohija, separatist aspirations, armed rebellion, terrorist activities, ethnic and religious extremism, natural disasters and technical and technological accidents, cybercrime and activities compromising the information and communication systems. 

Armed aggression against the Republic of Serbia in the forthcoming period cannot be ruled out. The defence policy of the Republic of Serbia based on military neutrality and active engagement in building and keeping peace and stability in the world will significantly contribute to eliminating this threat. Military neutrality policy, strengthening of the Serbian Armed Forces and training of the population for defence are deterrents against armed aggression on the Republic of Serbia. The continuation of EU integration process and better cooperation between the Republic of Serbia and regional countries, as well as the most influential countries in the world, especially in the area of security and defence, contribute to reducing the possibility of armed aggression against the Republic of Serbia.

20 Unlawfully and unilaterally declared independence of the territory administratively covered by the Autonomous Province of Kosovo and Metohija is contrary to the Constitution of the Republic of Serbia and United Nations Security Council Resolution 1244 and unacceptable for the Republic of Serbia. This declaration of independence has jeopardized the national and defence interests of the Republic of Serbia. The independence of the territory administratively covered by the Autonomous Province of Kosovo and Metohija being recognised by the states in the immediate neighbourhood of the Republic of Serbia and other states does not contribute to the strengthening of confidence and security stabilisation. The situation in the province and other open issues which are the subject of a political dialogue with the Provisional Institutions of Self-Government in Priština, represent the biggest political and security challenge for the Republic of Serbia. Unilateral acts by Priština, including attempts to gain membership in international organisations and demanding the reduction and abolition of international presence in Kosovo and Metohija, failure to meet the agreed obligations from the dialogue with the Provisional Institutions of Self-Government in Priština, organised crime and terrorism, transformation of armed formations calling themselves "Kosovo Security Force" into armed forces, as well as the deterioration of the security situation in the province, represent security threats for the Republic of Serbia.

Separatist aspirations, especially of some nationalist and religious extremist groups, and interest organisations, represent a source of constant security risk and a direct threat to the territorial integrity of the Republic of Serbia. They are fully manifested in the territory of the Autonomous Province of Kosovo and Metohija, expressed in the south of Serbia, with particular intensity of manifestation in the activities of local political, religious and cultural actors that, by unjustified exaggerating of issues of minority and human rights in the Republic of Serbia, encourage separatist aspirations, while in other parts of the country they are not that much significant in terms of security and defence. 

The security of the Republic of Serbia, in the domain of defence, may also be threatened by an *armed rebellion*, as a specific form of armed violence aimed at pursuing interests using unconstitutional and violent means. An armed rebellion that is based on separatist aspirations in order to change internationally recognised borders by force, represents a particular threat. The presence of separatist aspirations in certain parts of the Republic of Serbia, the efforts of extremists in the region to unify the territories in which they dominate demographically, the cooperation between extremist and criminal groups operating in its territory, as well as in the territories of some countries of the region, indicate that threats to the security and defence of the Republic Serbia through armed rebellion cannot be ruled out in the long run.

Asymmetry of the threat of terrorism and its connection with organised crime imply the possibility of carrying out terrorist acts in the territory of the Republic of Serbia, primarily for the purpose of achieving political goals. In addition to direct terrorism, the security and defence of the Republic of Serbia may be endangered by *terrorist activities* and the use of its territory for the transit, preparation and execution of terrorist acts in other countries. 

Ethnic and religious extremism can appear with varying intensity and consequences; individuals or organisations may practise it both from the territory of the Republic of Serbia and from the territories of other countries. This form of security threat, with the support of like-minded people from the territories of other countries, is also a generator of separatist aspirations.

Natural disasters, technical and technological accidents, as well as radiological, chemical and biological contamination, resulting from war and technical and technological accidents, represent a constant security threat to the Republic of Serbia, its population, material and cultural assets and the environment. The negative consequences of these phenomena can spread and threaten the territories of the neighbouring countries, and can also spill over from the territories of neighbouring countries to the Republic of Serbia, and threaten its territory and population. 

The development of modern information technologies, as a significant factor in the systemic organisation of the state, contributes to the creation of favourable conditions for a wide range of challenges, risks and threats to defence. Cyber-attacks on critical infrastructure facilities, cybercrime, 

activities compromising the information and communication systems, as well as spreading fake news and misinformation within the concept of hybrid and information warfare could adversely affect functioning of defence system elements. It is therefore necessary to continuously develop the technological and information protection of the defence system elements at all levels of organisation.

Security of the Republic of Serbia and its defence capabilities are also threatened by other risks and threats, with different likelihood of recognition and manifestation, primarily: transition problems, intelligence, corruption, organised crime, mass irregular migration, the problems of demographic development, as well as the misuse of scientific achievements in the fields of genetic engineering, medicine, meteorology and other fields. Responses to these types of security threats should be sought in the capacity building of competent public authorities, as well as in the intensification of cooperation at regional and international levels.

The contents, scope and likelihood of manifestation of the challenges, risks and threats to defence of the Republic of Serbia directly affect the establishment of the defence policy and building of defence system capabilities to protect our defence interests.

# 3. Defence Interests

The defence interests of the Republic of Serbia are based on its national interests. Their pursuit is intended for the achievement and protection of our national interests.

The defence interests of the Republic of Serbia are: protection of sovereignty, independence and territorial integrity; protection of security of the Republic of Serbia and its citizens; preservation of peace and security in the region and world; improvement of national security and defence through the European integration process; military neutrality; and cooperation and partnership with states and international organisations in the field of security and defence. 

Protection of sovereignty, independence and territorial integrity is the main precondition for the survival of the Republic of Serbia as a state. Meeting this defence interest enables the autonomous exercise of legislative, executive and judicial powers throughout the territory, preservation of integrity of the territory, and security of the population. The protection of sovereignty, independence and territorial integrity is based on the Constitution of the Republic of Serbia, national interests and international law, and the important precondition is a strong defence system.

Protection of security of the Republic of Serbia and its citizens creates conditions for the smooth functioning of public institutions, good quality of life and work of citizens, continuous development of all parts of society, and for the rational use of available resources. Meeting this defence interest ensures protection of the state, citizens and property from all forms of threats and promotion of the economy, building confidence and cooperation, and civic responsibility.

24 Preservation of peace and security in the region and world is significant for the security and stability of the Republic of Serbia and for its overall development. This enables the development of all parts of the society, building confidence and cooperation between states, peoples and citizens, as well as enhancing the security of diaspora and Serbs abroad. The participation of defence forces of the Republic of Serbia in maintaining peace and security in the region and world contributes to the improvement of their overall capabilities and capacities, security of the Republic of Serbia and its international position.

Improvement of national security and defence through the process of European integration contributes to the development of defence capabilities and capacities, as well as building confidence and intensifying the cooperation of the Republic of Serbia with the EU Member States. 

Military neutrality is a defence interest of the Republic of Serbia which derives from its national values and interests and its international status. With military neutrality, the Republic of Serbia declares its commitment not to accede to any politico-military alliances, which does not preclude defence cooperation. This creates conditions for strengthening the capabilities and capacities of the defence system and the improvement of the overall security of the Republic of Serbia and its citizens. 

Cooperation and partnership with other states and international organisations in the field of security and defence build mutual confidence, develop the capabilities of the defence system and improve overall security. Also, meeting this interest creates conditions for cooperation in other areas of importance for the Republic of Serbia.

Threats to our defence interests are considered as threats to the security of the Republic of Serbia as well. The purpose of the defence system is to protect the defence and national interests of the Republic of Serbia.

# 4. Defence Policy

Defence policy, as part of the national security policy of the Republic of Serbia, is a set of commitments, principles and positions directing the decision-making process and activities in the Republic of Serbia in order to protect and pursue our defence interests. The defence policy is implemented by undertaking harmonised measures in various areas of social life relevant to the defence of the Republic of Serbia.

The defence policy is aimed at creating appropriate internal and external, political, economic, social, security, military and other conditions for the protection and pursuit of defence interests of the Republic of Serbia.

The basic commitments, principles and positions of the defence policy, or the measures undertaken to carry out the defence policy, are presented in line with the defence interests of the Republic of Serbia to which they directly refer.

## 4.1. Protection Of Sovereignty, Independence And Territorial Integrity

In order to protect the sovereignty, independence and territorial integrity, the Republic of Serbia will accomplish the following goals:
- efficient management of the defence system; - timely detection and prevention of security challenges, risks and threats;
- deterrence against armed threats and efficient military defence;
- efficient civil defence;

- cooperation with KFOR in the Autonomous Province of Kosovo and Metohija in accordance with United Nations Security Council Resolution 1244.

Efficient management of the defence system is a prerequisite for protecting the sovereignty, independence and territorial integrity of the Republic of Serbia. In this regard, normative-legal, organisational and other conditions will be improved for the purpose of unified management, command and control of the defence forces in peace, state of emergency and war. An integrated telecommunications and information system will be established to support the process of management, command and control of the defence forces.

In order to effectively manage the defence system, the coordination and cooperation among all defence actors will be improved. Also, the capabilities and capacities for continuous monitoring of the situation and for making timely decisions relevant to the defence of the Republic of Serbia will be improved. Special attention will be given to defence preparations, with the focus on increasing the level of responsibility of all defence actors.

Timely detection and prevention of security challenges, risks and threats is of particular importance for the protection of the sovereignty, independence and territorial integrity of the Republic of Serbia. For the timely detection and prevention of the security challenges, risks and threats in the Republic of Serbia, the capabilities and capacities of the security-intelligence system will be improved. Special attention will be paid to enhancing the cooperation of all competent public authorities. A unified early-warning system will also be put in place.

In identifying and preventing security challenges, risks and threats, the Republic of Serbia will cooperate with other countries and international organisations. Also, the Republic of Serbia is determined to actively participate in the work of regional and other international organisations in the field of security and defence, with a focus on timely response to attempts at making decisions that would adversely affect its security and threaten its sovereignty, independence and territorial integrity. Deterrence against armed threats and efficient military defence of the Republic of Serbia are of key importance for the protection of its sovereignty, independence and territorial integrity. In this regard, the capabilities and capacities of the Serbian Armed Forces and other defence forces will be maintained and improved.

Maintaining the required level of capabilities of the Serbian Armed Forces and their upgrading will ensure adaptability of the defence system to the changes in the security environment and changes of the challenges, risks and threats to security of the Republic of Serbia. The development of the defence system will be based on the requirements and capabilities of the Republic of Serbia and it will be carried out pursuant to development plans and programmes. The Serbian Armed Forces are the main power and holder of main responsibility for the military defence of the Republic of Serbia. In this regard, the Serbian Armed Forces will develop a wide range of capabilities for performing various operations and tasks to respond to asymmetric and hybrid threats.

Particular attention will be paid to continuous and comprehensive preparations for military defence, as well as to improving the coordination of all defence system actors. The development and implementation of the concept of total defence will create conditions for the integral and timely engagement of all defence system actors.

The competent public authorities will continuously collect, analyse and assess data and information about potential and real dangers, activities, plans and intentions of entities that might threaten the sovereignty, independence and territorial integrity of the Republic of Serbia. Also, the capabilities and capacities of the competent public authorities for making timely decisions significant for the military defence of the Republic of Serbia will be improved.

Through active bilateral cooperation, participation in the work of international organisations and transparency in defence affairs, the Republic of Serbia will enhance confidence and mutual understanding, as well as friendly and partnership relations and cooperation with other countries and international organisations.

28 Efficient civil defence contributes to the protection of sovereignty, independence and territorial integrity of the Republic of Serbia. Normative-legal organisation of civil defence, in accordance with the concept of total defence, will specify competences, increase accountability and improve the qualifications of the defence system actors in the field of civil defence.

The Republic of Serbia will improve preparations for civil defence. 

Special attention will be paid to building organisational capacities for the unified management of civil defence, as well as organisational and personnel capacities for building competence of all defence system actors.

The Republic of Serbia is committed to cooperating with other states and international organisations in emergency situations. 

Cooperation with KFOR in the Autonomous Province of Kosovo and Metohija in accordance with United Nations Security Council Resolution 1244 is of particular importance for the Republic of Serbia. In this regard, it is determined to continue the communication, cooperation and implementation of joint activities with KFOR, participation in teams responsible for the implementation of the Military Technical Agreement, as well as other forms of cooperation with KFOR.

In order to ensure stability and security and continue the political dialogue with the Provisional Institutions of Self-Government in Priština, the Republic of Serbia will urge for the undiminished presence of KFOR as the guarantor of security in the territory of Kosovo and Metohija, particularly for the Serbian and non-Albanian population and the protection of the Serbian cultural and historical heritage. Measures will also be taken to prevent the transformation of the armed formations calling themselves "Kosovo Security Forces" into armed forces.

In order to protect its sovereignty, independence and territorial integrity, the Republic of Serbia will pursue a proactive and clearly profiled foreign policy and, for that purpose, it is determined to use diplomatic, legal and other means in accordance with the Charter of the United Nations and basic principles of international law. These activities also include a series of measures aimed at preventing the Provisional Institutions of Self-Government in Priština from affirming and promoting the unilaterally declared independence of a part of the territory of the Republic of Serbia administratively covered by the Autonomous Province of Kosovo and Metohija.

## 4.2. Protection Of The Security Of The Republic Of Serbia And Its Citizens

The protection of the security of the Republic of Serbia and its citizens will be achieved through accomplishment of the following goals:
- efficient control of the state border; - efficient protection and rescue of the population in peace, state of emergency and war;
- improved cyber security; - ensuring security of critical infrastructure facilities; - efficient crisis management.

Efficient control of the state border is one of the main prerequisites for the protection of security of the Republic of Serbia and its citizens. In order to improve capabilities and capacities for the control of the state border, measures will be continuously taken to train and equip members of the border police and other public authorities performing jobs and tasks at the state border with modern equipment.

Taking into account current security challenges, risks and threats, the capabilities of the Serbian Armed Forces to participate in border control will be improved. Capabilities for joint engagement of police and military forces in securing the state border will also be enhanced.

In order to contribute to the fight against international terrorism and transnational crime, the capabilities and capacities of all competent public authorities will be enhanced in order to collect, analyse, assess, protect and exchange data and information on international terrorism and migration. The Republic of Serbia is committed to enhancing the cooperation in border protection.

30 Efficient protection and rescue of the population in peace, state of emergency and war is of particular importance for the security of the Republic of Serbia and its citizens. In this regard, the assessment of threats from natural disasters and other accidents, as well as plans for the protection and rescue in peace, state of emergency and war at all levels, will be updated. The capabilities and capacities of firefighting and rescue units and civil protection units will be improved.

For the purpose of prevention, timely and effective response to emergencies, the functional integration of the services of interest is to be ensured for the protection and rescue and emergency management, as well as construction of a public alert system in the territory of the Republic of Serbia. Measures will be taken to continuously train emergency headquarters and population to carry out protection and rescue operations. 

The Republic of Serbia will continue active cooperation with international organisations in the field of protection and rescue of the population.

Improved cyber security is of special importance for the protection of security of the Republic of Serbia and its citizens. The capabilities and capacities for coordinating activities aimed at reaching cyber security and protection against security risks in information and communication systems will be improved. In this regard, a clear and coherent policy will be formulated, while, for the purpose of increasing the resistance of information and communication systems to incidents, a network of competent entities to combat cyber-attacks and crime will be established, and cooperation between the public and private sectors in the area of cyber security will be enhanced.

Ensuring security of critical infrastructure facilities is of primary importance for the protection of security of the Republic of Serbia and its citizens. In this regard, the designation and protection of critical infrastructure facilities will be normatively-legally regulated and harmonised with the regulations of the European Union. Also, special attention will be paid to the full implementation of normative-legal solutions. In order to ensure the security of critical infrastructure facilities, all preventive measures will be taken continuously, particularly in terms of their protection against fire, explosions and terrorist attacks. An integrated information system will be established for the security surveillance of critical infrastructure facilities.

Efficient crisis management is a significant issue for the security of the Republic of Serbia and its citizens. With a view to ensuring efficient crisis management, the capabilities and capacities of the Republic of Serbia will be improved. Training of the citizens will improve their ability to respond properly in emergency situations, state of emergency and war to reduce the risk of human casualties and damage to property. 

The Republic of Serbia is determined to actively participate in international activities for the prevention of crises caused by natural disasters and for damage relief in the region and in the world.

## 4.3. Preservation Of Peace And Security In The Region And World

The preservation of peace and security in the region and world, as a defence interest of the Republic of Serbia, will be pursued by accomplishing the following goals:
- preservation of Republika Srpska as an entity within Bosnia and Herzegovina in accordance with the Dayton Agreement and enhancement of the position of the Serbs in the region and world; 
- participation in multinational operations and missions under the auspices of the United Nations, European Union and OSCE;
- arms control and fight against proliferation; - assistance and mediation in the peaceful resolution of international crises and conflicts.

Preservation of Republika Srpska as an entity within Bosnia and Herzegovina in accordance with the Dayton Agreement and enhancement of the position of the Serbs in the region and world are of particular 

importance for the security and defence of the Republic of Serbia. The Republic of Serbia, as one of the guarantors of the Dayton Agreement will continue enhancing special parallel relations with Republika Srpska, while acknowledging the territorial integrity and sovereignty of Bosnia and Herzegovina. The Republic of Serbia is oriented towards establishing better quality and more meaningful relations with the states in the region, along with strengthening the regional approach to security and defence. The improvement of the position of the Serbs in the region and world creates conditions for a cohesion and development of society, enhancement of position and protection of rights of the Serbs wherever they live, and of the Serbian cultural, spiritual and historical heritage in other states, enhancement of cultural exchange, understanding and acknowledgement of cultural and other differences, and enhancement of position and rights of national minorities in the Republic of Serbia.

Through *participation in multinational operations and missions under* the auspices of the United Nations, European Union and OSCE, the Republic of Serbia will contribute to the maintenance of peace and security, both in the region and world. In this regard, the engagement of the Serbian Armed Forces and other defence forces in multinational operations and missions outside the Republic of Serbia will continue, and their capabilities and capacities for participation will be improved.

- strengthening cooperative security with the European Union; - participation of the Republic of Serbia in the activities of CSDP; - achieving the required level of capability for participation in CSDP 
civilian missions;
- enhanced scientific research and military-economic cooperation with the European Union.

Strengthening cooperative security with the European Union serves the 34

# 4.4. Improvement Of National Security And Defence Through The Process Of European Integration

purpose of improving national security and defence. By integrating into the European Union, the Republic of Serbia becomes part of a broader community and security area based on mutual assistance and solidarity in accordance with the provisions of the Treaty on European Union and the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (the Lisbon Treaty). Particular attention will be paid to strengthening individual security and promoting regional stability.

The Republic of Serbia is determined to hold security and defence consultations with the European Union on issues of common interest, with the possibility of joint action within the Common Security and Defence Policy, which would be based on common European values.

Participation of the Republic of Serbia in the activities of CSDP is of particular importance for the improvement of its national security and defence. The Republic of Serbia will continue to participate in European Union military operations and civilian missions and intensify its participation in the CSDP bodies and integrated structures, which will positively influence the capacity building of the Serbian Armed Forces and other defence forces and reaffirm the readiness of the Republic of Serbia to share the responsibility for peace and security. The participation of the Republic of Serbia in the concept of the European Union battle groups is of particular importance for the enhancement of national security and defence through the process of European integration. In this regard, the planning, preparation and operationalisation of the participation of the Serbian Armed Forces and other defence forces in the European Union battle groups will continue.

By participating in the concept of the European Union battle groups, the Republic of Serbia further confirms its pro-European orientation and commitment to peace and security at the global and regional level. Such engagement will also contribute to the enhancement of the capabilities and capacities of the Serbian Armed Forces and other defence forces, notably through participation in joint military exercises. Bearing in mind that militarily neutral members of the European Union, as well as other countries that are not members of either the European Union or NATO, 
participate in this concept, the military neutrality of the Republic of Serbia is not an obstacle to its further inclusion.

Achieving the required level of capability for participation in CSDP civilian missions contributes to the aspiration of the Republic of Serbia to strengthen the capacities for a comprehensive approach to conflict resolution. The normative-legal and institutional framework for participation in civilian missions of the European Union will be improved, as well as the extension of the current engagement of the Serbian Armed Forces and other defence forces.

Engagement of civilian experts of the Republic of Serbia in CSDP civilian missions will focus on conflict prevention, support to institution-rebuilding and post-conflict stabilisation, security sector reform, establishment and strengthening of the rule of law, protection of human rights, mediation, support for economic reconstruction and other aspects of engagement in civilian missions.

The required level of capabilities and capacities for participation in EU 
civilian missions will also be defined in order to create and maintain a database of experts, select appropriate civilian staff, identify training needs and train civilian personnel for deployment to EU civilian missions. 

36 Enhanced scientific research and military-economic cooperation with the European Union will be achieved through the implementation of activities with scientific-research institutions and Member States of the European Union in scientific fields relevant to defence, in order to improve the capabilities and capacities of the defence industry and the national institutes' research potential.

Improving programme and project cooperation with the European Defence Agency will enable technological modernisation of the Serbian Armed Forces and other defence forces. Mechanisms and procedures will be established for the involvement of scientific research institutions within the defence system in international research consortia.

Also, military-economic cooperation with EU Member States will be improved by expanding the area and increasing the scope of cooperation important for the defence of the Republic of Serbia.

## 4.5. Military Neutrality Of The Republic Of Serbia

In order to create conditions for the integral engagement of defence system actors and defence potentials, it will be ensured that the basic documents on planning the use of forces are kept up to date, in accordance with the law. 

Strengthening patriotism and willingness to defend and protect the fatherland in peace, state of emergency and war, in keeping with our own tradition and achieved civilisational values, through education, media, cherishing tradition and activities aimed at strengthening social unity, feeling of national identity, promoting values of freedom and peace, as well as responsibility for preserving them will be of particular importance.

38 Creating conditions for defence based on its own strengths and potentials will be realised by paying special attention to the defence system development planning and the implementation of development plans and programmes.

The operational capabilities of the Serbian Armed Forces and other defence forces will be maintained at the required level. The necessary level of supplies and war reserves will also be provided and maintained.

Further development of the defence industry and the continued creation of conditions for the functioning of the economy and society in the state of emergency and war will be of particular importance to the defence that relies on its own strengths and potentials. The economic development of the Republic of Serbia will create conditions for significant investments in the development of the defence system and modernisation of the Serbian Armed Forces and other defence forces.

# Conclusion

The Defence Strategy is a strategic document which states the basic positions, commitments and measures to be undertaken by the Republic of Serbia in order to protect and pursue its defence interests, and, concurrently, its national interests as well.

The Republic of Serbia protects and pursues its defence interests in a complex, ever changing security environment that is hard to predict, shaped by actions of a large number of different, interdependent factors. The state of its security environment demands quick adjustment to newly emerging changes, preventive and pro-active action, as well as a comprehensive response of the state and society.

The defined defence interests express permanent need and aspiration of the Republic of Serbia and its citizens. They are based upon universal and national values arising from the Constitution, heritage of the Serbian people and all the citizens living in the Republic of Serbia. 

In order to protect and pursue our defence interests, a defence policy has been defined. It sets guidelines for decision making and action of the Republic of Serbia, and it is implemented by undertaking comprehensive and coordinated measures in different areas of social life. By implementing the defence policy, apart from protecting and pursuing the defence interests, the conditions are created for political, economic, social, cultural and overall social development of the Republic of Serbia.

The basic role of the defence system is protection and pursuit of the defence interests through pursuing the defined defence policy. The defence system is a normatively, structurally, functionally regulated system which is composed of the managing and executive part with precisely defined responsibilities.

54 In that respect, the responsible public authorities will continuously monitor the implementation of the Defence Strategy and undertake necessary measures to ensure that it is harmonised with the state and assessment of the security environment. The Defence Strategy changes in accordance with the change of the key factors which determine it, and necessarily in case of the change of the National Security Strategy.
