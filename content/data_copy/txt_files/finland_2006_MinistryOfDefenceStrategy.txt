## We Need an Open Debate

The Ministry of Defence Strategy 2025 “Securely into the future” has three objectives. It
makes a concise assessment of the long-term development in our security environment.
On the basis of the assessment, the Strategy describes the future challenges facing
Finnish defence policy and military defence. Thirdly, it explores the means by which
these challenges can be met. By this publication we hope to increase awareness of the
key points in our military defence.

The Strategy is based on the strategic planning process of the Ministry of Defence, with
representatives of the Defence Forces also participating. Long-term strategic planning is
done simultaneously with mid- and short-term planning. Government Reports on Finnish
Security and Defence Policy (White Papers) are submitted every four years. Choices
described in these reports influence long-term planning. The Strategic Plan, for its part,
serves the preparatory work for the White Paper by clarifying the picture vis-à-vis future
development options.
## ........

The cornerstones of Strategy 2025 are the common values of the Ministry of Defence and the Defence Forces:
Security, reliability, credibility and patriotism. It is on these values that we will proceed into the future.

Security means safeguarding the functions vital to our society. We defend the entire territory of our nation
and participate in preventing and repelling internal security threats. Furthermore, we participate in international
cooperation and military crisis management.

Reliability, for us, implies that in all situations we act as part of a democratic society and carry out the decisions of
the state leadership. Citizens, the state leadership and cooperation partners, domestic and foreign, as well as our
own personnel must be able to rely on the Ministry of Defence and the Defence Forces.

Credibility stands for the credibility of our defence capability. This is the most important factor with regard to
preventing external security threats to Finland as well as maintaining our defence will.

Patriotism means that we work for our nation’s future while respecting the sacrifices of previous generations. We
want to ensure that future generations will also be prosperous, safe and secure, and able to make independent
decisions in the constantly changing international security environment.

.........

Regardless of how our security environment develops, Finland will have to respond to several challenges. Our
international dependence will increase. This expanding interdependence will result in the increased significance of
cooperation. In the future, Finland will engage in cooperation ever more broadly, both at home and abroad.

The age structure of the Finnish population is experiencing great change. People age and this, too, influences the
resources available for our defence. The ever-intensifying technological development has a similar effect as well. New
technologies provide many opportunities, but the flipside is that the price of defence materiel is rapidly increasing.

In spite of growing collaboration and increasing interdependence the foundation of Finnish defence will remain
national. We Finns will remain responsible for the defence of our own country, regardless of future defence solutions.
The solid core of Finland’s defence will always be Finnish.
## ........

By publishing this paper the Finnish Ministry of Defence aims to spur the debate regarding the future of our military
defence. An active debate on the justifications of defence solutions is part of a genuine democratic process. The more
matters of principle are discussed, the sounder the decisions. Also future solutions should strive to have wide-ranging
consensus.

## Introduction

When defence is being developed, attention
will be paid so that no practical obstacles to
possibilities of participating in the EU’s common
defence, which may be developed in the long
term, nor to applying for NATO membership are
created.
The Ministry of Defence will be developed as the
strategic-level planner, leader and implementer.
Relations with domestic and international
cooperation partners will be cultivated.


##### The desired end state for 2025 - the goals of the Ministry of Defence

Military defence must be able to maintain a credible
capability to deter, and if deterrence fails, to prevent
and repel military threats to Finland in the security
environment of the 2020s. Finland will develop
her defence either militarily non-allied but in close
international cooperation or as militarily allied.

The Defence Forces must be able to support the

civil society and other authorities in preventing
and repelling wide-ranging security threats as well
as in limiting their consequences. Pursuant to the
decisions of the state leadership, the Ministry of
Defence and the Defence Forces intensify and further
develop the capability for international cooperation
and military crisis management.

In future decades the Ministry of Defence intends

to further cement its position as a dependable
expert for the state leadership as well as a significant
security and defence policy opinion-maker within
the government. The Defence Ministry’s role as
coordinator of total defence activities will be
developed. Furthermore, transparent and intense
interaction related to total defence issues will be
increased within the public administration as well as
with other actors.

In order to reach the desired end state:


♦

##### The foundation stands, change continues


♦

♦

♦


Military defence must be developed in the future
as well.
The tasks of the Defence Forces will be
maintained and developed, within our means,
according to changes in the security environment
and advances in technology.
The activities of the Ministry of Defence and
the Defence Forces rely on citizens’ support and
approval.


♦

♦

♦


The Defence Forces’ capabilities for carrying
out the statutory tasks will be maintained and
developed by allocating the long-term resources
required by the security environment.
The critical success factors for key competence
areas will be defined. Skilled personnel for said
areas will be recruited and trained.
Resources for critical success factors will be
secured by rationalizing tasks and functions of
the Defence Forces.


As a part of Government and as the leader of its
administrative branch the Ministry of Defence is
responsible for national defence policy and security.
In addition to being responsible for preparing and
implementing defence policy, the Ministry of Defence
is responsible for allocating resources and other
prerequisites for military defence, coordinating total
defence issues and participating in military crisis
management. The capability to implement these
tasks, combined with citizens’ support, general
conscription, the solid will to defend the nation
and voluntary national defence activities, forms the
foundation for the future.

Military defence will create the required capability

to prevent and if necessary repel military threats
against Finland as well as support the civil society and


-----

other authorities in the prevention of wide-ranging
security threats. The role of the Ministry of Defence
as the coordinator of total defence activities is based
on transparent and constant interaction involving
the public administration, private enterprise and
non-governmental organizations.

The primary future tasks of the Defence Forces

are: Military defence of Finland, supporting society
and other authorities as well as participation in
international military crisis management. The tasks
are mutually supportive and can be carried out
with the resources that are primarily maintained
for the task of defending Finland. In the future,
Finland will establish a capability for participating
in more demanding crisis management operations.
As for international cooperation and military crisis
management, the Ministry of Defence and the
Defence Forces must be able to respond to goals
and decisions established by the state leadership.

Strategic planning is a continuous development
process.
The Strategic Plan spans the next two decades.
The Plan is updated every four years.
The Strategy lays the groundwork for the longterm development of the Ministry of Defence
and the Defence Forces.


information was obtained from the EU’s Long Term
Vision process and from international research
institutes.

The Strategy and the Government Report on

security and defence policy (White Paper) are
closely intertwined. The present White Paper is
the key political framework document guiding the
Strategy. Likewise, this Strategic Plan combined
with the Defence Forces Development Programme
provides principles for the preparation of the next
White Paper. Furthermore, the Strategic Plan is
tapped into when operational and financial plans,
resource allocation and development programmes
are being drawn up.

The desired end state of the defence system

is reviewed at least every four years or whenever
strategic developments or political guidance so
require.

To begin with, as Strategy 2025 was being

developed, security environment development
options as well as threats facing Finland and
the means of responding to the threats were
comprehensively assessed. The Defence Forces
continued the work in their long-term planning.
The Defence Forces’ strategic planning process
produces the desired end state of the defence
system as well as the Defence Forces Development
Programme and the Research Programme. The
end product of planning generates the capability
requirements for weapon system procurement
projects, for example, as well as for the required
personnel training. Modern weapon systems are
extremely expensive and long-lasting because
they remain in operational use for 20-30 years.
A military defence capability is the outcome of
decades of work and, therefore, it is not possible
to revive a deactivated capability even over a long
period of time. For this reason, when a defence
system is being developed one must look at least
twenty years ahead.


The Strategic Plan of the Ministry of Defence is
the fruit of cooperation between the Ministry of
Defence and the Defence Forces. The Plan guides
the development of defence policy and the defence
system with the aim of creating capabilities which
also respond to future challenges and utilize
future prospects. Background information was
domestically obtained from the Defence Forces’
and other research establishments. In addition,


-----

##### Scenarios and shocks - instruments for evaluating the future

Strategy 2025 uses three possible future global
development scenarios as aids in the analysis. The
scenarios do not attempt to predict the future.
Instead, in lieu of a vision that is estimated to be
the most likely to materialize, several mutually
interchangeable scenarios are devised. The

scenarios extensively explore the changes in our
security environment as well as their possible longterm consequences to Finland. The scenarios in
Strategy 2025 are:


## Development trends globally and
 in the near environs


in population centres. The number of working
age people (15-64) will already peak at the end
of this decade. It is estimated that by 2030 this
number will have decreased by 370 000 persons.
Simultaneously, the number of people 65 years
of age or older will have increased by 570 000.
This trend in Finland will have consequences on
the labour market and on economic growth. One
solution to challenges posed by the age structure
change is to substantially increase the immigration
of working age people.

The most significant changes in the size of the

annual conscript intake of 20 year old males have
already taken place. The size of the 20 year old male
age group will remain at its present volume until
2012, whereafter it will decrease by approximately
10% by 2030. Competition over skilled labour will
increase and this will affect the Defence Forces,
too, as they have to operate as a good employer in
the labour market.

##### Environment and natural resources: Deprivation breeds instability, Finland remains dependent on energy imports

Total food production would exist to feed the growing
global population but the distribution of food is
uneven. Famine plagues authoritarian countries or
countries suffering from internal conflicts. By 2030,
lack of potable water will be a problem for over fifty
per cent of the world’s population. The significance
of water in world politics and as a catalyst for
conflicts will increase.

Energy requirements grow but reserves remain

sufficient for the assessment period. The stability
of energy producing regions influences the price
and availability of energy. The price of energy will
remain high in the future as well and, therefore,
alternative solutions must be sought. Energy - its


♦

Scenario A: Globalization and collaboration
intensify; a more peaceful world emerges
Scenario B: Business as usual
Scenario C: Economic growth stalls and

collaboration is paralysed as global structures
weaken. International conflicts multiply

Recent history testifies to the fact that single


The Ministry of Defence adopted the global approach
for its Strategy. Key trends in the development of the
security environment can be analysed in more detail
within the previously mentioned scenarios. It is of
vital importance to perform this analysis in strategic
planning. The following five trends — population,
environment and natural resources, technological
development, globalization of the economy as well
as the roles of the international order and states
— lay a foundation for the evaluation of military
conflicts and wide-ranging security threats.

##### Population: Growing in developing countries, greying in Europe and declining in Russia

Uncurbed population growth and urbanization
continue in developing countries. In most developed
countries birth rates are declining and the median
age is increasing. It is estimated that the total
population of the present 25 EU Member States will
be approximately 470 million in 2025. This represents
only 6% of the world’s population. The median age
of European countries is increasing, diminishing the
dynamics and innovativeness of their society. This
poses serious challenges for the EU’s economic
growth and competitiveness. The population of the
United States continues to grow, aided by substantial
immigration, longer life expectancies and higher
birth rates. It is estimated that the population of
the United States will be approximately 364 million
in 2025. The Russian population will continue to
decline, by almost 9 %, until 2025 when it reaches
an estimated 129 million.

Finland’s population will peak in the 2020s,

estimated to be at a little above 5.4 million in 2025.
Thereafter, beginning from 2028, the population will
slowly shrink. The birth rate will remain low, with
the median age increasing and people converging


dramatic events and chains of events, such as the
fall of the Berlin wall, terrorist strikes in the United
States and in Europe or disasters, such as a tsunami,
can amount to seminal events that influence the
security environment.

Therefore, the Strategy’s scenarios have been

augmented by recognizing shocks, i.e. positive
or negative developments which, at the moment,
seem unlikely. Such shocks could be, for example:
A new energy production method, a pandemic, the
collapse or economic downfall of a major power,
an environmental disaster or the European Union
falling into serious crisis. Should a shock materialize,
it could jolt the intra-scenario development or
even transfer the development into an altogether
different scenario. Shock assessment highlights the
need for prognostic security environment monitoring
and evaluating as well as for the maintenance of
preparedness.


-----

##### The international order and the role of nations: The EU and transatlantic relations are important to Finland

In the foreseeable future the United States will
retain a dominant role in international affairs.
China and India will increase their political clout
as Russia tries to preserve her status as a major
power. As integration intensifies, the EU countries
will form an increasingly coherent community and
the Union will attempt to strengthen its role as an
international actor. The simultaneous enlargement
is a challenge to the European Union’s internal and
external ability to act. Transatlantic relations will
remain high on the EU’s agenda.

Consequences of security problems spread faster

and wider than ever before. Future threats and the
solutions to them are global and individual nations
will not be able to opt out of the problem-solving
sphere.

States retain their role as key actors. However,

their influence will shrink as the role of multinational
and non-governmental actors grows. Developed
welfare states will be more prone to internal
instability. The growth of political extremism may
increase violent protests and indigenous terrorism.
The significance of religion as a defining feature of
people’s identity may grow and alter views of the
character of the traditional nation-state along with
the increased immigration and multifaith traditions.
Globalization will revolutionize decision-making
and communications, making it more difficult for
authoritarian governments to remain in power.

The significance of case-by-case multinational

groupings will increase. They will augment the activities
of international organizations. The importance of
regional organizations will also grow.

It is in Finland’s national interest to promote EU

coherence, especially, when it comes to security
and defence policy. The European Union is the most
important organization from the Finnish perspective.
However, in the enlarged Union Finland must be
able to make choices and, if necessary, to intensify
case-by-case cooperation between groupings


supply, transfer routes and resources - is used as an
instrument of political influence and pressure. By
2030 the EU’s dependency on imported energy will
have increased from the present 50% up to 70%. As
for imported oil, the EU’s dependency in 2025 will
increase to up to 90%, and up to 80% for natural
gas. The bulk of energy the EU uses comes either
from Russia or through Russia.

Finland will remain extremely dependent on

imported energy. Renewable energy sources

can cover only a fraction of her total energy
consumption. Finland’s economic growth can be
endangered by disturbances in energy or raw
material production or deliveries caused by tension
in international relations or crises. Guaranteeing
national security of supply and international supply
security arrangements will increase in significance.
The continually rising price of energy also affects
the activities of the Defence Forces.

Environmental disasters and changes in the

environment may directly or indirectly reflect on the
global security situation, on the EU and on Finland.
This is why, as the Defence Forces’ capabilities
are developed, it is also appropriate to prepare to
support other authorities in environmental disaster
consequence management. The Ministry of Defence
and the Defence Forces must take environmental
protection issues into consideration in all activities
and to further develop its capacity for environmental
disaster prevention.

##### Technological developments: Bigger prospects - challenged by price increases and system vulnerability

Advances in technology and the introduction of
new technologies occur faster and faster. On the
whole the effects of these are positive, but at the
same time security risks grow. The proliferation of
information technology applications enables the
fast and purposeful spreading of political ideas and
practices.

New technologies do not alter the character and

conventions of traditional warfare. Developing and


maintaining military technologies is challenging
from the perspective of resources. It is estimated
that modern defence materiel doubles in price every
seven years. The maintenance costs for new materiel
grow proportionately. Expensive defence technology
forces us to seek future solutions by innovatively
integrating high-technology weapon systems and
cost-effective commercial systems. Nevertheless,
the number of new development projects and
procured systems will decrease in the future.

The development in information technology

facilitates network enabled warfare. This is an
operational concept based on an effective and
wide-ranging information-gathering, analysis and
collection systems, on modular and capable units,
international interoperability as well as a highly
developed command and control system.

Finland keeps abreast of the technology

development and maintains first-class know-how
in her own key competence areas. The expanding
introduction of new defence technologies poses
challenges to the military security of supply in crisis
situations to a small country like Finland which has
limited resources. This highlights the significance of
materiel cooperation among the Nordic countries
as well as within the European Union.

As technology advances, the vulnerability of

the society and the defence system increases. It
is estimated that the intentional abuse of new
technologies will mainly bring about indirect security
risks to Finland, such as paralysis of information
networks and command and control systems as
well as disruptions in the society’s vital functions.

##### The globalizing world economy - interdependency increases

Globalization drives growth in the world

economy, raises living standards and increases
interdependency among nations, as well as
economic integration and political stability. Nations
no longer wield absolute control over the economy.
Instead, some of the control becomes multinational.
However, the benefits of globalization are not fairly

distributed. Nations that are sidelined from the
benefits of globalization may form a security threat
and a breeding ground for terrorism.

The United States as well as the emerging

economic powers China and India are the most
effective nations at exploiting the openings of
globalization. The EU will maintain its status as an
economic area almost as large as the United States,
even though its economy will be suffering in the
2010s due to its ageing population.

Russia is a centrally controlled market economy,

whose economic growth largely hinges on the
prices of energy and raw materials. Russia also uses
her status as an oil and gas exporter to maintain
and expand her clout. Russia’s economic progress
is held back by demographic factors, a dilapidated
infrastructure and risk factors in her political
development.

Our national economy is affected by the

fluctuations in world trade conditions and remains
dependent on foreign trade. When the median
age of our population increases, economic growth
may slow down and latitude in the public economy
may get smaller. As in other European countries,
the maintaining of the welfare society in Finland,
too, will become increasingly expensive. Growth
pressures on general government finances will add
to the uncertainty over defence appropriations and
may complicate long-term defence development.

representing different views. As the EU continues
to expand and due to a possible multi-speed
development of its security and defence policy,
Finland must deliberate the level and degree of her
participation in activities. Finland underscores the
responsibility of the international community in the
prevention of crises and humanitarian disasters as
well as in the protection of the civilian population.
As a rule, we participate in crisis management
operations which are mandated by the UN.
However, we may have to make choices on whether
to participate in operations which do not have an
explicit UN mandate. The activities of a globally
engaged EU may generate adverse reactions which
will also affect Finland and the Finns.

###### The spectrum of military conflicts will expand - the traditional boundary between war and peace will become indistinct - asymmetric warfare will be more common


Future military conflicts will mainly be regional or
internal in nations. They will often build on historical
reasons, disputes over the control of energy sources,
natural resources or potable water, ethnic and
religious tension, societal and economic inequality
as well as the lack of human rights and democracy.
Regional conflicts will have wide-ranging spillover
effects and other new, cross-border security threats
will be associated with them. These conflicts will
often begin in failed states, in whose crises their
neighbors meddle.

A grey phase, varying in duration, will exist between

the traditionally perceived conditions of war and
peace. The threat of military force or a limited use
of it as a means of pressure is symptomatic to the
phase. In addition, political and economic pressure as
well as means of asymmetric warfare disrupting the
society’s vital functions occur during the grey phase.
Asymmetric warfare selects the most vulnerable


targets and chooses methods for which the opponent
does not have adequate preparedness. Asymmetric
warfare is embodied in international terrorism, an
attempt to acquire weapons of mass destruction
and to the threat of using them, computer network
attacks as well as information warfare.

In the past, terrorists acted against preselected

targets in accordance with their regional and
political objectives. In the future, the global threat
of international terrorism aiming at large-scale
destructive effects will increase. The methods
of terrorism will also be widely used against
international crisis management operations as well
as against other military campaigns.

Preparedness against asymmetric security

threats requires intensified cooperation between
international and domestic security authorities. This
expands the military’s traditional range of tasks. In
spite of these new tasks, the capability to defend
one’s own territory against a military attack or the
threat of an attack remains the fundamental task
of the armed forces.

The proliferation of technology, poor border

security and globalization of the weapons industry
highlight the significance of arms control activities.
Even though monitoring and regimes are being
developed, the potential use of nuclear devices and
other weapons of mass destruction has still not been
ruled out. A nuclear weapon improves the standing
of a single state or a non-governmental actor in a
regional power struggle. The largest military powers
take the possible use of tactical nuclear devices
into consideration in their doctrines.

The threats of international terrorism,

proliferation of weapons of mass destruction,
information warfare, network jamming and attacks
as well as spillover effects from regional conflicts
also reflect on Finnish society. Finland, along with
other developed states, must actively participate in
finding responses to global security threats. In the
future we will likely have to consider participating in
preemptive military action as part of a larger country
grouping.

##### ➢ Crises are intervened in increasingly earlier threats targeting developed Western countries are

The principles of international jurisprudence on


The proportional share of the United States in
global defence spending will begin to decrease in
the long term as China and India heavily invest
in their own defences. Partners will become even
more important to the United States. From the EU’s
perspective it would be unrealistic to assume that
available defence appropriations would suffice to
cover the creation of all capabilities. Therefore, the
need to strengthen the transatlantic relationship as
well as EU-NATO cooperation will be accentuated.

Western countries’ defence policies and military

activities increasingly focus on rapid response
capabilies beyond their own territories, on crisis
management as well as on wide-ranging security
threats. The area extending from North Africa through
the Middle East and Central Asia all the way to
Southeast Asia forms a wide arc of instability, where
conflicts will most likely occur. Most of the security


the use of military force are called into question
as most conflicts are - in lieu of conventional
warfare - unconventional. Interventions of the
international community on issues traditionally
considered a state’s internal affairs will become
more acceptable.


International crisis management forms an entity
comprising development policy, early warning and
conflict prevention, military and civil crisis management in the acute phase, as well as post-conflict
stabilization and reconstruction.

Military crisis management will become more

demanding. Rapidly deployable and militarily

demanding operations executed far away from Europe
pose challenges to it. For example, rapid response


##### ➢


###### Modernizing crisis management - Finland possesses formidable competency.


capability and preparedness for long-distance strategic
transport increase the costs of crisis management.

The conditions in which crisis management troops

operate are more demanding and the troops do not
have logistic support similar to that at home. Many
diverse actors operate in the crisis area. The local
population does not necessarily accept the troops’
presence. In addition to post-conflict stabilization
there must be the ability to rebuild a functioning
society in the area. Operations will be long-lasting
and will require strong commitment from the
international community.

Finland must prepare for more demanding

military and civilian crisis management along and
beyond the borders of Europe. We may face growing
pressure to increase our share in international crisis
management. Crisis management requires swift
multinational and domestic decision-making as well
as sufficient military resources in high readiness.


##### ➢


###### Use of military force against Finland is still possible - furthermore, the threat can increase rapidly.


In addition to participating in crisis management,
Finland must also continue to prepare for military
threats to her territory or to her society’s vital
functions. The likelihood of using military force


against Finland remains small. However, a significant
and qualitatively improving capability for the use of
military force remains in our vicinity. The probability
of using military force against Finland may increase
as part of an escalating global or European conflict
and that probability may also rapidly grow. The
consequences of a possible projection of military
power against Finland, should it materialize, would
be devastating. Therefore, the defence system
must be maintained and developed in a long-term
and anticipatory fashion.

The political and military development in our

vicinity, especially in Russia, significantly influences
Finland’s security. Along with maintaining her
political integrity, the capability to defend Moscow,
St. Petersburg and the Kola Peninsula remains
Russia’s primary objective. The significance of
the Baltic Sea to Russia will increase, particularly
because of vital energy and materiel transports.
Kaliningrad remains a special exclave where
economic and social development lag behind
the median in Russia. However, this direction of
development may change should Kaliningrad
manage to take advantage of its location in
the middle of EU and NATO countries. Russia
will continue to maintain considerable military
capabilities in the region and the main naval base
for her Baltic Fleet is located in Kaliningrad.

Russia will become more prosperous with

revenues accrued from exporting energy and raw
materials. This will also enable investments for
modernizing her armed forces and increasing their
capabilities. Instability along her southern border
and problems related to Islamic separatism affect
the internal situation in Russia. Disputes over
oil resources and over the control and use of oil
lines in Central Asia and the Caucasus will reflect
on Russia’s relationship with other great powers.
Tensions in Russia and in the CIS area may spawn
security threats. Russia will also endeavour to
maintain its special relationship with NATO.


Instead, NATO will establish capabilities for
operating globally, wherever future threats

originate. Simultaneously, cooperation with partner
countries external to Europe will be intensified and
expanded.

The global power projection capability of the

United States is of crucial importance to the defence
arrangements and capabilities development of
European NATO members.

The members of NATO are still committed to

the collective defence. Merely by existing, NATO
creates a deterrence to those posing a potential
threat. The security guarantees and the capability to
implement them will be preserved as life insurance,
which protects against any future surprises.
However, military crisis management is emphasized
in NATO’s operational activities. Common defence
planning as well as command and troop structures
are developed to flexibly conform to the prevailing
strategic situation assessment.

Through developing partnership activities with

NATO Finland can more effectively participate
in exercises and NATO-led crisis management
operations. However, this evolving partnership does
not enable participation in the alliance’s collective
defence. Neither does it facilitate fully fledged
participation in decision-making nor in military
capabilities development.

##### Wide-ranging security threats - a challenge for the entire society

Diverse threats can target the functions vital to
society in the future. In addition to traditional
military threats, individual threats also contain
other dimensions. This means that the concept of
security has expanded.

The significance of wide-ranging security threats

is increasing and new and better means to respond
to them are being sought. Wide-ranging threats
constitute, inter alia, the following:

Integration will intensify the EU trait of being a
security community for its member states in which
military conflicts between member states are highly
unlikely. However, the relations of an enlarged
EU to its new neighbors may spawn security
challenges. The greatest threats to the EU countries
remain terrorism, proliferation of weapons of mass
destruction and regional conflicts as well as socalled failed states and organized crime.

Policy (ESDP) is likely to proceed. Europeans will

increasingly assume responsibility for the security of
their continent and its surrounding areas.

Some of the member states may deepen mutual

military cooperation within the structures of
the Union, yet for the most part cooperation will
continue to concentrate on crisis management. The
Solidarity Clause and possible security guarantees
will increase the security of the member states.
NATO will remain the foundation and implementer
of its members’ collective defence. During the
period of this evaluation the EU will probably not
create a territorial defence capability independent
of NATO. Therefore, only NATO membership can
provide military security guarantees.

The EU’s strength is its wide range of instruments.

In addition to military crisis management, civilian crisis
management, military training and advisory activities
as well as disarmament will remain its focus.

The primary function of the European Defence

Agency, EDA, is to intensify the development and
harmonization of the EU’s military capabilities.
The EDA’s activities build on the European Security
Strategy and the EU’s crisis management tasks.

The EU’s new security environment creates

challenges for Finland’s security and defence policy.
Threats focusing on the Union also target Finland
and, along with other EU countries, Finland must
participate in responding to these threats. The EU’s
possible security guarantees strengthen Finland’s
security. Finland must also have the capabilities
to provide and receive the assistance detailed
in the Solidarity Clause. As security and defence
policy integration intensifies and due to advances
in technology, Finland’s dependence on other
countries in the Union, with regard to developing
and maintaining Defence Forces’ capabilities, will
increase. Participating in the European Defence
Agency’s activities supports the development of
Finland’s national defence.


interlinked, difficult to predict, multifaceted and they
have little early-warning. Due to their character, in
order to properly prepare for and respond to them,
vigorous international and domestic cooperation
and pre-agreed collaboration arrangements are
required. Military resources can also be used to
defend societies against wide-ranging security
threats. This may expand the range of tasks of the
armed forces.

The preparedness for wide-ranging security

threats must be taken into consideration as the
Finnish defence system is being developed.

In addition to society, wide-ranging security

threats may also target the Defence Forces, both
at home and while deployed to international crisis
management operations.

## How we prepare for the 2020s


The readiness to repel any use of military force
against Finland is the responsibility of the Ministry
of Defence and the Defence Forces. The long-term
development of the defence system also includes
preparedness for the worst-case scenario.

##### Foresight - the essence of a successful defence system

The significance of monitoring and evaluating the
strategic security environment as well as making
anticipatory decisions will increase in the future. The
Ministry of Defence is in the process of improving
its capability to do strategic evaluation. The Defence
Forces compile a military-strategic assessment
for the entire state leadership by monitoring the
development of military threats. This is augmented
by intensifying international cooperation.

Strategic planning in the Ministry of Defence and

in the Defence Forces establishes the preconditions


for long-term political decision-making and resource
allocation, spanning approximately 20 years.

The joint intelligence, surveillance and command

and control system covering all of the services will be
further developed. Hence, the capability for rapidly
raising readiness and for executing operations both
at home and abroad is guaranteed.

##### Basic tasks: Military defence, supporting other authorities and international crisis management

The most important goal is to preserve a credible
defence capability. This is done so as to maintain
the deterrent threshold for use of force against
Finland high enough to outweigh the perceived
benefits of attack. Irrespective of Finland’s military
non-alignment or alignment we prepare to prevent
and, if necessary, repel a military threat primarily
on our own. In addition to this, we also prepare for

kept suitably low and the sufficiency of troops in
the reserve can be guaranteed.

General conscription lays the groundwork for the

Finnish citizens’ strong will to defend the nation and
for their commitment to national defence. It also
promotes citizens’ social equality and guarantees
the transparency of the Defence Forces’ activities
in the society.

##### Voluntariness as a key asset

Voluntary military defence supports the Finnish
Defence Forces’ wartime troop training as well as
the maintenance of defence capabilities. It also
augments the nation’s general preparedness and
capability for action. Consequently, the Defence
Forces’ wartime troop training can be supported in an
economical way and the Defence Forces’ capacities
for executive assistance can be developed.

Wartime regional troops are reinforced by

voluntary local defence troops, which are developed
as cores of regional troops. Local defence troops are
capable of rapidly responding to threat scenarios in
emergency conditions as well as providing support
for society’s vital functions. The most important
tasks of local defence troops are to protect
key targets and functions as well as to patrol
appropriate areas and to support the activities of

international collaboration and develop our ability
to receive support.

The Finnish Defence Forces cooperate in unison

with other authorities so as to seamlessly secure
the functions vital to society. The Defence Forces’
expertise, equipment, infrastructure and situational
awareness information constitute valuable

assistance to other authorities. At the same time
the Defence Forces acquire valuable information
and experience for the development of its own
activities.

The capabilities for international cooperation

and military crisis management are quantitatively
and qualitatively developed as per our international
obligations and in accordance with the requirements
of future operations. The Defence Forces’ functional
and material interoperability is being improved. The
Defence Forces also prepare for force protection
against wide-ranging security threats while

deployed to international operations.

##### Modernizing the defence system - quality replaces quantity

Finnish society will be more vulnerable in the future.
The character of war is changing and military
technology advancing. The future defence system
will focus on defending the nation’s key areas and on
securing the vital targets and functions of society.

The modernized defence system will facilitate

all services’ effective joint operations in the next
decade. The core of the defence, fulfilling the
requirements of network enabled warfare, will
build on army, navy and air force readiness units
and on the integrated intelligence, surveillance and
command and control system. Units decrease in size
but simultaneously advance in mobility, firepower
and range.

As long as resources can be allocated for the

required military capabilities, the development of
the defence system does not signify compromising
the defence of the nation’s entire territory. Force
is flexibly concentrated and centres of gravity are
formed as required.


##### Cost-effectiveness is optimized -  materiel, operations, maintenance and personnel expenses are balanced

During the past decade the biggest post-war
changes have been implemented in the Finnish
defence system. The transformation process

is incessant. The Defence Forces’ peacetime
development and relocation of activities centre on
the main tasks. Permanent and fixed arrangements
will be abandoned in favour of functional and
administrative models that are more flexible and
less restrictive.

Cost-effectiveness is striven for when developing

the defence system. However, it is possible that
current defence appropriations will be too low for
developing our defence capability according to the
new requirements. If prices, especially those of
defence materiel, continue to grow at the present
rate, major defence capability reviews or substantial
supplementary appropriations may be required.

Defence spending requirements also increase

due to the fact that the official functions related
to total defence are becoming business-based. By
outsourcing the Defence Forces’ support functions
core functions can be concentrated on. However,
this poses increasing challenges regarding the
defence establishment’s competence as a customer,
the development of contractual and logistic systems
as well as the safeguarding of security of supply.

##### General conscription continues to be an effective solution for Finland

General conscription is a cost-effective way to
implement the defence of the entire territory of
the nation as well as to carry out the other tasks
of the Defence Forces. The overwhelming majority
of Finnish citizens as well as the state leadership
continue to support general conscription. In the
future the entire segment of the annual intake
which is fit for military service will be trained in
accordance with wartime troop requirements. This
way the average age of operational troops can be


the authorities. In the future local defence troops’
tasks can be expanded to include the tasks of the
combat arms branches.

Voluntary military defence boosts the Finnish

citizens’ will to defend the nation and increases the
Defence Forces’ provincial visibility. Furthermore, it
broadens women’s opportunities in participating in
the national defence. Voluntary military defence, its
prerequisites and the other required resources will
be further developed. Voluntary military defence
will be carried out under parliamentary control and
under the guidance of the Ministry of Defence.

##### Competence is emphasized

The performance of the Ministry of Defence and
that of the Defence Forces crucially hinge on
the competence of their personnel. Competence
management and control is a critical success factor.
It affects the Ministry of Defence´s and the Defence
Forces’ competitiveness as employers, their

performance and service ability as well as their
productivity. We must be able to recruit competent
personnel and to offer growth opportunities to our
skilled staff.

management call for an increase in the competence
of the Defence Forces’ personnel. Since conscripts
are highly educated to begin with, it is already
possible to train them for highly demanding tasks
within their present period of military service.
Conscript training, too, must aspire towards even
higher professional competence. In this way
sufficient numbers of personnel will be trained to
subsequently be recruited to international crisis
management tasks and to the regular personnel of
the Defence Forces.

materiel procurement projects and in their financial
arrangements. NATO runs its own, well-developed
security supply system.

##### Total defence - the concern of the entire nation


Total defence is our national model in which threats,
required preparedness and the measures required
in a crisis are considered as an entity. Each branch
of administration, private enterprise and nongovernmental organization plays its own role and
has its tasks within the total defence concept.

Securing the functions vital to Finnish society


as well as the total defence concept-based
coordination that is required among government
branches will continue to be emphasized. Due to

preparedness for and responses to them require

forces. Instead, professionalization means skills

so as to avoid unnecessary duplication of efforts

obligations, ever increasing in number and scope,
demand a flexible personnel system which is

and operations, including lessons learned, also
boosts the performance and capabilities of our
national defence. In order to fully participate in

Finland must be able to collaborate with the NATO

vigorous international and domestic cooperation
and pre-agreed collaboration arrangements. As the
society protects itself against wide-ranging security
threats the resources of the Defence Forces can be
used in support of other authorities in increasingly
versatile tasks.

The military defence of Finland and the required

coordination of all government branches’ activities

- which are tasks under the purview of the Ministry
of Defence - are the most demanding total
defence tasks and tie up the the greatest share of
society’s resources. It is sensible to also employ
the principles of total defence coordination while
responding to other wide-ranging security threats.
The management and cooperation that is required
during a crisis that has already begun is always led
by the competent ministry.

The total defence concept provides tools for

assigning appropriate command responsibilities
and resources. In order for this concept to work,
all administrative branches must constantly

monitor and analyse developments in the security
environment and within society. In addition, they
must periodically review relevant statutes and their
own preparedness plans.

The Finnish Defence Forces provide excellent

support for other authorities with their expertise,
equipment, infrastructure and situational awareness
data. In practice, such support is being increasingly
requested. Executive assistance commitments on
statutory and international collaboration obligations
are likely to continue to increase. Inter-authority
interaction, however, must be intensified on all
levels.

be devastating. A military threat develops faster
than it is possible to reactivate a previously
decommissioned capability or before a militarily
non-allied country can secure concrete assistance
from an alliance.

Defending Finnish entire territory and general

conscription form a viable foundation for our
modernizing defence solution also in the future.

Due to advances in technology and our increasing

international commitments, the requirement for
professional competence is highlighted in the
development of the Defence Forces.

The use of our reserve troops will be intensified

by developing voluntary defence arrangements as
part of our wartime defence. Local defence troops
can be issued tough security and combat arms
branches’ tasks and they will be trained to be
capable of providing executive assistance.

International cooperation constitutes an essential

element of Finnish defence policy. When defence
is being developed, attention is paid so that no
practical obstacles to the possibilities of applying
for NATO membership nor to participating in the
EU’s common defence, which may be developed in
the long term, are created.

Being a part of the EU’s defence dimension,

Finland must prepare for more demanding military
crisis management along the outer reaches of
Europe and even beyond.

As the Finnish defence of the 2020s is being

planned, the fundamental questions are (1) will
Finland continue militarily non-allied or will she
become allied, and (2) how big a share of the
national budget is Finland willing to invest in her
defence. Answers to these questions involve
political decisions which depend on developments
in our security environment and on the prospects
of our national economy. Regardless of these
solutions the solid core of Finland’s defence will
always be Finnish.


Global security challenges increasingly affect
Finland’s security. The key objective of Finland’s
security and defence policy is political and military
stability in our near environs. The direction in which
Russia develops, both politically and militarily, is of
crucial importance. This development is intertwined
with her economic development and the progress
of her internal reforms. Great opportunities for
Finland are inbuilt in Russia’s development, albeit
with risks and problems. The key interest for Russia
continues to be the protection of strategically vital
areas as well as securing oil and gas deliveries in
the Baltic Sea area.

Even in the future the main tasks of the Defence

Forces comprise the military defence of Finland,
providing support for other authorities and the
society as well as international military crisis
management.

A credible defence capability requires that

approximately one third of the defence budget be
allocated to materiel procurement in the future, too.
The cost pressure is significant. In order to maintain
the present level capability corresponding to future
requirements, major re-evaluations of the system or
considerable increases in defence appropriations are
needed.

Due to limited resources the Defence Forces’

military capabilities must be developed in such
a manner that they can also be flexibly used in
international military crisis management. Capabilities
must also be exploitable in preventing and repelling
wide-ranging security threats.

It is warranted that the task of coordinating total

defence be under the purview of the Ministry of
Defence. The Finnish total defence concept will be
viable in the ever-changing security environment in
the future as well.

The possibility exists that a country would

project military power against Finland. The
consequences of this, should it materialize, would

##### Definitions

Asymmetrical warfare
Military and non-military action that uses means or equipment for
which the opponent is unprepared. The main forms of asymmetrical
warfare are terrorism, sabotage, the proliferation and use of
weapons of mass destruction and information warfare.

Capability
The capability of the defence system or its subsystem,
consisting of personnel (troop) competence, materiel and the
principle by which the system is used. Said capability can be
divided into operational and tactical capability. Operational
performance consists of the effect of the capability, its life
span and usability. Tactical capability consists of command and
leadership, mobility, survivability and logistics.

Capability requirement
The requirement established for the defence system or part
of it, which has to be reached by a given date. The capability
requirement comprises sub-requirements concerning several
different components.

Defence policy
The process of preparation, decision-making and political
guidance concerning the tasks and general arrangements of
the nation’s defence. It also concerns Finnish participation in
activities concerning the maintainance of international security
and stability. Defence policy covers all aspects of national
defence and the Ministry of Defence is responsible for it.

Defence system
The Defence Forces defence system consists of command and
control and administration systems, intelligence and surveillance
systems, troop production and mobilization systems, a supply
and logistics system, command echelons and troops.

Development programme
The end product of strategic planning, covering at least the midterm (4 years) planning period. The development programme
provides the basis for drawing up the operating and financial
plans during this period. Furthermore, it defines the focal points
for development and resource allocation in order to reach the
established goals.

Government Report on security and defence
The security and defence policy report is the Government’s basic
position, setting out the principles and objectives for Finland’s
security and defence policy and providing a framework for its
implementation in the different sectors. In accordance with the
Government Programme, the report evaluates the entity of
Finland’s security and defence policy.

Military crisis management
Crisis management activities implemented by military means
(peace support activities). The primary purpose of these
activities is to restore and maintain stability and security in
crisis areas with the specific aim for creating proper conditions
for re-establishing the other functions of the society.

Military defence
The planning, preparation and implementation of the Defence
Forces’ statutory tasks.


Network based warfare
An operational concept providing real-time command over
sensors, echelons and units. It is based on an effective and
wide-ranging information-gathering, analysis and collection
system, on modular and capable units, international

interoperability as well as on a highly developed command and
leadership system.

Security of supply
The safeguarding of economic functions and ancillary technical
systems vital to the livelihood of the population, the national
economy and national defence in exceptional circumstances or
comparable serious disturbances.

Situational awareness
Situational awareness stands for the understanding by decisionmakers and those assisting them of the events that have taken
place, the circumstances surrounding them, the objectives of
the different parties and possible further developments, all
of which are needed to make decisions on a particular issue
or set of issues. The creation and maintenance of situational
awareness can be promoted by providing and updating
information as necessary, for example, by using pictures, texts
and charts.

Strategic plan
The Strategic Plan provides the basis for developing the
military defence during the long-term period. The goal is to
maintain the capabilities determined by the state leadership
and to develop them with the allocated resources. The purpose
of strategic planning is to prepare the grounds for strategic
decision-making at the Ministry of Defence and in the Defence
Forces.

Total defence
The use of all military and civilian measures to safeguard
Finland’s independence and the livelihood and security of
her citizens against external threats, posed by states or by
others. Coordination of total defence means coordinating the
measures of the public sector, i.e. those of the Government,
state authorities and municipalities and the private sector as
well as citizens’ voluntary activities in order to sustain the vital
functions of society under all conditions.

Wide-ranging security threats
Threats which cause severe danger to the population or serious
or significant interruptions to society’s vital functions. They
either consist of deliberate human activities (e.g. spreading
malicious software via networks and terrorism), accidental
occurrences (e.g. wide spread blackouts in the electric grid
and an accident at a nuclear plant) or natural disasters. These
threats which often cross national borders are characterized
by unpredictability, difficulty in predicting and localizing as well
as short early warning. They usually represent a component
of military threats or are linked to them.
