#### E X E C U T I V E S U M M A R Y

The White Paper on Defence was published in February 2000. This was the first-ever White Paper

on Defence and it set out the policy framework and development strategy for the period to 2010.

The overall Government objective was to achieve affordable and sustainable Defence Forces

capable of fulfilling the roles laid down by the Government: “A major objective (of the White Paper)

is to ensure that Ireland has a world-class military organisation”, (Minister for Defence, foreword to


the White Paper, February 2000).

In addition to confirming the roles of the Defence Forces and providing a policy framework, the

White Paper set out specific recommendations for change, re-organisation and investment

throughout the Defence organisation. The programme for development and change was directed at

“the provision of Defence Forces organised, maintained and equipped on conventional military lines

to ensure a defence capacity suited to current and contingent needs”. Achieving the appropriate

balance between pay and non-pay investment was a key factor. Building on progress already

underway on the development of Defence Forces capabilities, the aim was to have a sustainable

world-class organisation, trained and equipped to deliver the roles laid down by Government. The

White Paper mapped the way ahead for the management of the Defence organisation, including


reserves, and for Civil Defence.

The ongoing modernisation of defence has coincided with the evolution of significant challenges.

While the security threat is assessed as low, the international defence and security environment

has changed appreciably since September 11, 2001 and subsequent terrorist actions worldwide.

The asymmetric threat posed by Islamist extremism presents new challenges, especially to

intelligence organisations, including military intelligence. In peace support missions, the UN has

revised its policy and approach. International peace support missions are now more robust in nature

and more complex. More precise requests for the commitment of interoperable, sustainable and

operationally effective contingents have arisen under European Security and Defence Policy. The

Government has decided that Ireland will participate in the Nordic EU battlegroup. It is prudent to

assume that the rate of change in the general defence environment will continue to challenge


defence agencies in the coming years.

Substantial progress has been made in implementing the White Paper. As set out in this review,

most of the recommendations for change have been implemented or are being implemented

according to agreed timetables. These include reductions in numbers, investment in equipment and

infrastructure, continuous recruitment, the re-organisation of the Reserve, Civil Defence, etc. Other

recommendations, such as civilianisation, require further work in order that progress can be made.

Arising from the White Paper and the implementation of the report “Response to the Challenge of

a Workplace”, particular progress has been made in Human Resources development and


management, the key resource area of the Defence organisation.

The policy framework set out by Government in the White Paper covers the period to 2010.

Implementation of the White Paper recommendations is continuing. Capability is being evolved to

meet known and emerging demands. The need to attract and retain suitable personnel as well as

the delivery of modernisation and value for money, central issues in the Framework Partnership

Agreement, are informing this process. In addition, the Defence organisation is responding to the


**3**


-----

changes in the defence and security environment and in the workplace. In doing so, it is drawing

on the improvements in capability and effectiveness delivered by implementation of the White


Paper.


Appropriate resources are crucial to successfully achieving the overall goals set by Government for

defence. At a minimum, that requires a continuation of Government policy on the re-investment of

payroll savings and the proceeds of property sales in the Defence Forces.

##### Review Background


As 2005 marked the mid-point in the 10-year period envisaged in the White Paper, the Minister

requested that a review of progress be carried out. The Review focuses on implementation of

specific recommendations in the White Paper. Policy parameters, strategic objectives and the roles

of the Defence Forces, are set for the duration of the White Paper.


A Civil / Military Steering Group and Working Group were established to carry out the Review. The

members of these Groups were:


##### Steering Group:

Major General S. Brennan Asst. Secretary Mr M. Quinn


(Replaced by Major General P. Nash)

##### Working Group:


Colonel G. Hegarty, Ms B. O’Doherty, Principal Officer

Colonel D. Ashe, Mr C. Murphy, Principal Officer

Colonel M. Finn Mr B. Coghlan, Principal Officer


Mr J. Blighe, Principal Officer

Mr R. Mooney Assistant Principal Officer, Planning & Organisation Branch, Department of Defence,


was Secretary to the Group.

##### Terms of Reference


The Steering Group agreed the following terms of reference for the Review:

® to report to the Minister on the extent to which relevant White Paper goals, objectives, plans


and recommendations have been achieved or implemented and to recommend any relevant


action; and,

® to make any other recommendations as the Group sees fit.


® In pursuit of the above the Review Group may, without prejudice to the generality of the

terms of reference, take into account in its deliberations all relevant current and anticipated


environmental and other factors.

##### Goals of the White Paper

Before moving on to the substance of this review it is appropriate to note the key goals of the White


Paper:

The key goals of the White Paper are:


® To provide a light infantry based force with an appropriate level of all-arms capability;

® To provide sufficient forces and capabilities to meet needs at home and to make a significant


contribution abroad;

® To put in place a more cohesive and better equipped force than exists at present;


® To provide significant additional resources for equipment and infrastructure broadly within


the existing level of financial allocation.

(Page1, para 3)


In addition the White Paper outlined the basis for the future development of Civil Defence Policy

and Chapter 7 of the White Paper specifically addresses Civil Defence.


It was noted that the key goals would require the creation of a balanced and flexible military

organisation, which had sufficient depth in terms of personnel, doctrine, training, organisation and

equipment to meet expected future needs. It was also noted that the then organisation provided a

strong starting point but that a process of continuous change would be needed to ensure that the

State had effective and efficient Defence capabilities relevant to its needs.


(Page 1, para 4)

The White Paper recognised that the change and reorganisation recommended was

complementary to the growing focus on strategic management in the public service. The White

Paper set out a policy framework and development strategy for defence for the decade leading to

2010 including a new approach to enable the management of defence to respond in a dynamic way

to future needs. It was also acknowledged that the development strategy would build on the


reorganisation and reform process begun in the 1990’s. (1.1.1, 1.1.2).

##### Key Recommendations


The White Paper contained many detailed recommendations aimed at achieving these goals. The

most significant of these can be summarised as follows:


® achieve a balance of 70: 30 in terms of pay to non-pay ratio in the defence budget;


**7**


-----

® reduction in Defence Forces numbers by 1,000 and allocation of 100% of pay savings to

investment in equipment and infrastructure;


® allocation of 100% of the proceeds of property sales to equipment and infrastructure;

® development of the Army based on a three brigade structure and along the lines of “…a light


infantry based force with an appropriate level of all-arms capability”;

® development of the Air Corps and major investment in equipment;


® a new ship for the Naval Service and efficiency and effectiveness measures to enhance

fishery protection;


® continuous recruitment to the Defence Forces;

® development of a comprehensive personnel management system;


® development of the Reserve, including a new organisational structure and investment in

training and equipment;


® new emphasis on the Department’s role in policy development, Departmental human

resources management, and a reduction of 10% in Dept of Defence staff numbers;


® continued development of Civil Defence and an increase in funding;


® establishment of a new statutory authority to manage the Curragh lands.

##### Review outline


The review is structured as follows:

**Section 2** outlines environmental changes that have occurred since publication of the White


Paper;


**Section 3** examines the detailed recommendations contained in the White Paper and the effect

of the environmental changes since 2000 and reports on progress to date;


**Section 4** assesses the degree to which the key goals outlined in the White Paper have been

achieved.

The White Paper in 2000 built on progress already under way to set out fundamental and

comprehensive change for the Defence organisation. Coincidentally, the challenges emerging in the

international security environment resulted in significant changes in the structures and approaches

of International organisations including the UN, European Union and NATO PfP. The domestic

security situation has also evolved. As a result, the Defence organisation has had to respond to

substantial changes, such as the more complex and demanding nature of international peace

support operations, during a period of internal transformation. The roles assigned by Government

to the Defence Forces have not changed but the approach to fulfilling these roles, particularly in


respect of overseas service, has become more demanding.

##### International Developments


**UNITED NATIONS**

The UN response to conflicts in Africa and the Balkans in the 1990s was widely criticised and led

to a period of self-examination by the UN. In 2000 the Brahimi Panel report referred to the changed

nature of conflicts and highlighted the consequent need for, inter alia, quick response to complex

and volatile situations far beyond traditional peacekeeping with western nations in particular being

called upon to provide self-deploying, self-sustaining, quick reaction forces. The report emphasised

Chapter VII peace enforcement operations and the requirement for operations to be capable of

applying credible coercive force. This change in the traditional role of the peacekeeper has

necessitated the Defence Forces to be equipped, trained and prepared, not least psychologically, to


meet these new requirements.

A report by the UN Secretary General’s High Level Panel on Threats, Challenges, and Change

entitled ‘A More Secure World: Our Shared Responsibility’ (2004), emphasises the need for

collective security and for security to be addressed at the global, regional and national level. The


report identifies six clusters of threats:

® Economic and social, including poverty, infectious disease, and environmental degradation;


® Interstate conflict;

® Internal conflict, including civil war, genocide, and other large scale atrocities;


® Nuclear, radiological, chemical and biological weapons;

® Terrorism;


® International organised crime.

-----

**EUROPEAN UNION**

The period since 2000 has seen significant development arising from the European Security and

Defence Policy (ESDP), in terms both of operations and organisation structures. The continuing

evolution of ESDP as a key agenda for the EU has impacted on Ireland’s foreign policy agenda and

has given rise to significant demands on the Defence organisation and the Defence Forces in order


that Ireland can engage effectively and proactively within the Union.

The ambitions of the ESDP are set out in the Treaty on European Union as humanitarian and rescue

tasks, peacekeeping tasks and tasks of combat forces in crisis management, including

peacemaking (the Petersberg Tasks). The period since 2000 has seen a transition from “institution

building” to the undertaking of actual civil and military operations. The Political and Security

Committee (PSC) and the Military Committee (EUMC) were formally established. The EUMC

provides the PSC with military advice. A military staff was formally created (EUMS) within the

Council of the European Union providing situation awareness, development of operational concepts

and strategic planning for operations. The European Security Strategy was adopted by the Heads

of State and Government in 2003 identifying threats and establishing more coherence in conflict

prevention and crisis response, including military capability. The European Defence Agency (EDA)


was established by the Heads of State and Government in 2004.

In the period since 2000 the EU has demonstrated its developing capability by undertaking both

civilian and military operations. In 2003 the EU launched its first military mission, under UN

mandate, in the Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia (FYROM). Since then there have been

further EU-led military missions in the Democratic Republic of The Congo (DRC), Sudan, Bosnia &


Herzegovina and Indonesia.

In 2004 the Headline Goal 2010 was adopted. Member States have made commitments to the new

Goal, with an emphasis on the quality and rapid response capability of force contributions. The

Headline Goal introduced the Battlegroup concept. In this regard, in November 2006, the

Government approved the provision of a contingent of the Permanent Defence Force to participate


in a Nordic Battlegroup.

**NATO’S PARTNERSHIP FOR PEACE (PFP) AND PLANNING AND REVIEW PROCESS (PARP)**


Ireland had just joined PfP when the White Paper was approved by Government. As anticipated,

PfP continues to benefit the Defence Forces by enhancing their capacity for multi-national

peacekeeping. In 2001 Ireland joined the Planning and Review Process (PARP). The Defence Forces

attend training courses and workshops under PfP PARP, aimed at developing best practice and

improving the level of interoperability between forces in the context of Peace Support Operations

and the Petersberg Tasks. The focus in PARP is on enhancing interoperability and familiarity with

operating procedures in a multi-national environment. Of course, the Defence Forces also continue

to feed their considerable experience in these fields into this process.


**11**


-----

In 2003 Ireland agreed to make available a range of military capabilities outlined in a palette of forces

for UN mandated Peace Support Operations under NATO/PfP


Ireland’s commitment of 850 personnel to the UN Standby Arrangements System (UNSAS) also

comprehends the palette of forces offered to PfP and the EU Headline Goal.


##### International Terrorism

The events of September 11, 2001 and subsequent events worldwide, have brought international

terrorism to centre stage and have made important new demands of security and defence

organisations, particularly in the field of intelligence. It is generally agreed that in the period ahead,

the risks to international stability seem more likely to come from terrorism than from conventional

military threats. Ireland cannot consider itself immune from this threat, including the potential use

of the country as a transitory location by terrorist organisations, or as a base/safe haven to facilitate

attacks in other jurisdictions. Effective intelligence and a multi-faceted, international and multi
agency approach are at the core of the response to threats posed by international terrorism. In this

regard, the Defence Forces and An Gárda Siochána perform complementary roles in relation to

State security and the Defence Forces perform the primary role in relation to security of their forces

deployed overseas. The Secretary-General and the Chief of Staff attend the National Security


Committee.

Enhancing intelligence capabilities and analytical processes are key priorities. Mutual assistance and

co-operation is maintained between the Irish security services, including military intelligence, those


of like-minded countries and international organisations.

##### Domestic Security Situation


The domestic security situation has continued to improve since the Good Friday Agreement.

However, continuing indigenous threats remain. As stated in the latest report of the Independent

Monitoring Group, dissident republican groups remain dangerous and ruthless, willing to commit

extreme terrorist violence, and loyalist groups remain involved in a range of crimes, which differ

from group to group. While the level of Border operations by the Defence Forces has eased

considerably, other static security and escort ‘aid to the civil power’ (ATCP) operations remain. In

the case of significant events the Defence Forces have also been called on to provide Brigade level

(2,500) support to the Gárdai, e.g. during Ireland’s presidency of the EU in 2004. This support

usually calls for military protection tasks, riot control teams and air and maritime operations.


**12**


The Office of Emergency Planning (OEP) was established by Government in the Department of

Defence following the events of September 11, 2001. This civil-military Office has the objective of

co-ordination of emergency planning across all Government Departments and other key public

authorities and to oversee the emergency planning process in general. The OEP supports the work


-----

of the Government Task Force on Emergency Planning, which is chaired by the Minister for

Defence. The Task Force continues to meet regularly as does the Interdepartmental Group on

Emergency Planning.


The Defence Forces play a major supporting role in the emergency preparations of many public

sector organisations. To facilitate a higher level of effectiveness in emergency planning,

Government Departments are being asked to set out their requirements in the form of MOUs.


Improvised explosive devices using conventional and fabricated explosives remain the weapon of

choice of the international terrorist. In the aftermath of September 11, the Defence Forces

Explosive Ordnance Disposal (EOD) teams were quickly equipped and trained to deal with scores

of incidents where packages suspected of containing anthrax were found. Effective intelligence

links are important in maintaining the Defence Forces capability in EOD. The aim is to maintain the

capability to respond to threats as they emerge in EOD and also in the area of Chemical, Biological,

Radiological and Nuclear (CBRN).


##### Other Environmental Factors

The defence and security environment is the most significant influence on the defence organisation

and its planning for the future. To get a fuller picture of the changed environment in the period under

review it is appropriate to note other significant influences and their impact in the period since 2000.


##### Public Service Modernisation

The Defence organisation has delivered significant change and modernisation in line with the

Strategic Management Initiative and the ‘Action Plans’ under the Social Partnership Agreements.

This change and modernisation has been achieved in strategic and business planning, financial

management, human resource management and customer services, while also remaining


consistent with the White Paper objectives.

Developments in the Human Resources (HR) area are considered in detail elsewhere in this Review.

Greater emphasis on strategic planning and on policy formulation and review has been achieved and

business planning and review is well established. The introduction of the Management Information

Framework (MIF) across the organisation has been a significant project, enhancing and improving

business processes. Risk management procedures and structures have been integrated into all

areas of Defence activity and strategies are used to manage and, where practical, eliminate or

reduce risk in the pursuit of stated strategic goals. Regulatory Reform is being advanced. Customer

Service Action Plans have been introduced by the Department of Defence and the Defence Forces.

The Performance Management and Development System (PMDS) has been successfully

implemented in the Department of Defence and the Partnership Process in the Department and the


Defence Forces is robust.


**13**

##### ‘Challenge of a Workplace’

Following allegations of bullying and harassment in the Defence Forces in 2001, an external

advisory committee, chaired by Dr. Eileen Doyle, was tasked with examining this issue in the

Defence Forces and the committee presented their original report, “The Challenge of a

Workplace”, in March 2002. This independent report addressed a wide range of interpersonal

issues within the Defence Forces and its contents and recommendations were accepted in full. This

report complemented many of the recommendations contained in the White Paper relating to

Human Resource Management. Specific initiatives implemented are dealt with later in this Review.

Dr. Doyle also chaired a Monitoring Group that reviewed progress and produced a report entitled

“Response to the Challenge of a Workplace” in 2004. There is a commitment to review progress


again in 2007.

##### Reduction in Public Service Numbers – Government decision 2003


In July 2003, the Government decided that public service numbers should be reduced by 5,000 over

three (3) years. The required reduction for the Defence organisation was 416, with 250 coming from

the Defence Forces, 150 from civilians employed with the Defence Forces and 16 civil servants in

the Department of Defence. The reductions were fully implemented by the end of 2005.

##### Introduction


This section encompasses some of the more important recommendations made in Chapters 4, 5,

6, 7, 8 and 9 of the White Paper.


As stated earlier this Review does not re-open matters of policy established by Government in the

White Paper. Neither is it a detailed audit of every recommendation in the White Paper. It is rather

a mid-term assessment of progress made and includes the identification of areas requiring further

attention, particularly in the context of the changed security environment.


##### Section 4.3: Defence Forces Organisational Structure

The White Paper specified a strength of 10,500 for the Defence Forces and provided for an

additional 250 personnel in training at any one time. The White Paper directed the Chief of Staff to

produce a plan to implement the required reduction (from 11,500) and this was achieved. In June

2003, as part of the Government’s measures to reduce public service numbers, the authority to


have the additional 250 personnel in training was withdrawn.

Para 4.3.17 also authorised the Chief of Staff to carry out any further “…organisational

adjustments...” necessary to reflect the White Paper’s requirements, subject to an implementation

plan to be approved by the Minister. The overall strength of the PDF has been reduced to 10,500.

It is important that the organisational structure is such that available numbers can be deployed in

the most effective way to carry out the tasks assigned. The objective in reviewing Army

organisation is to eliminate structural factors and imbalances, which militate against the


achievement of the White Paper goal of a more flexible and deployable light infantry based force.

Several factors impinge on the attainment of the optimal army organisation: changes in the period

since the White Paper in the nature of overseas deployments and the introduction of the Lead

Brigade concept, the inability to redeploy personnel in certain circumstances, pre and post 1993

conditions of overseas service, barracks infrastructure, convergence issues and commitments to

the EU Headline Goal. Work is continuing to design and implement the most appropriate and


flexible organisation.

##### Para 4.5.5, 4.5.6: Personnel - General (Human Resource Management)


The White Paper noted that the adaptability, professionalism and commitment of personnel within

the Defence Organisation are a key strategic resource. This has been recognised by the fact that

one of the four Defence Forces Strategic Goals, as outlined in the Defence Forces Strategy

Statement 2005-2007 now relates specifically to Human Resource Management (HRM), namely:


**16**


-----

® “To recruit, develop, motivate and sustain effective human resources to support the delivery


of military capability and defence outputs”.

The White Paper set out the elements to be included in an Integrated Personnel Management Plan.


Considerable effort is invested by the Department of Defence, Defence Forces and Representative

Associations in the ongoing improvement of Human Resources in the Defence Forces. A great deal

has been achieved to date in the areas of recruitment and selection, graduate intake of Officer

Cadets, award of cadetships to enlisted personnel, training and development, promotion

agreements, equality issues, review of contracts for Enlisted Personnel, complaints procedures and

the lowering of the age profile within the Defence Forces.


An independent monitoring group was established in May 2002 to oversee the implementation of

the recommendations contained in “The Challenge of a Workplace”. A progress report, “Response

to the Challenge of a Workplace”, was launched by the Minister for Defence in September 2004.

Arising from the Doyle report, a number of steps have been taken. Firm guiding principles have

been set out in the Defence Forces Dignity in the Workplace Charter. A major educational

awareness programme is ongoing throughout the Defence Forces. A new administrative instruction

on interpersonal relationships was introduced in March 2003. The instruction and a user’s guide

were distributed to every member of the Defence Forces.


Designated contact persons (DCPs) have been fully trained and are deployed throughout all

Defence Forces posts and barracks, both nationwide and overseas. The DCPs facilitate the

operation of the formal and informal procedures that may be used by any party wishing to institute

a complaint. An independent, external confidential freephone helpline and counselling service was

set up for members of the Permanent Defence Force in March 2003. An independent pilot project

of exit interviews seeking the experiences and views of outgoing members of the Permanent

Defence Force was conducted. Leadership training has been given by external experts and has

been the subject of NCO focus groups with an emphasis on “training the trainers”. Changes in

cadet school instruction have been initiated, with issues concerning the ranking, selection and

training for cadet school instructors being addressed.


Defence Forces regulations, administrative instructions, policies and procedures have been

reviewed by an equality steering group under a Labour Court chairperson. An officer within the

Defence Forces Human Resources Management section has been assigned responsibility for

equality matters. A training circular entitled Military Code of Conduct for students and instructors in

all training environments was issued in 2004 and was followed by an extensive series of associated

workshops for all relevant personnel. A further independent review of progress in this area is

scheduled to take place in 2007.


The Ombudsman (Defence Forces) Act, was enacted in 2004, and the first Ombudsman for the

Defence Forces was appointed in 2005.


**17**


-----

A new Defence Forces HR Strategy was published by the Chief of Staff in 2006 outlining a human

resource strategy framework to 2010. It reflects the reports described above, HR elements of the

Government’s ‘Modernisation Agenda’ and the White Paper objectives.


##### Para 4.5.5, 4.5.6: Recruitment

The White Paper confirmed a policy of regular recruitment aimed at maintaining the capabilities of

the Defence Forces. Authority for the recruitment and advertising process has been delegated to

the Chief of Staff. As can be seen from the table below the Defence Forces has maintained a

regular intake of recruits since 2000. Its recruiting campaign ‘A Life Less Ordinary’ won the


Independent Newspapers ‘Excellence in Recruitment Advertising Award (2000/01).

Meeting targets relating to downsizing has led to some rank and specialist imbalances and

geographic anomalies. Some of the difficulties in resolving this issue arise from the constraints in

transferring personnel between locations and Corps. These are not easily resolved. Efforts to

address/minimise this issue will continue.


##### Para’s 4.5.5 & 4.5.6: Revised Officer Promotion System

A promotion system for Officers in the Army and Air Corps giving increased emphasis to merit was

agreed between the Department and the Representative Associations in 2004. This system is

currently operating effectively and is scheduled to run until 2009. Agreement has recently been

reached in respect of a similar system for the Naval Service. These competitions now allow for the

promotion of some personnel to achieve higher rank earlier in their careers while ensuring the


**18**


continuation of reasonable career expectations (4.3.10).


-----

##### Para 4.5.5: Commissioned from the Ranks (CFR)

The White Paper included a commitment to “Regular schemes to commission enlisted personnel

as officers in the Army, Air Corps and Naval Service”. The Defence Forces Action Plan under

Sustaining Progress provided for an “integrated officer induction and initial training system that will

provide for regular intakes of school leavers, graduates and personnel with service in the enlisted

ranks of the PDF”. More favourable conditions are now in place to attract both graduates and

enlisted personnel. The upper age limit for officer cadet entry has been increased substantially and

bonus marks are awarded to serving enlisted personnel presenting for interview. This has resulted

in an increased number of enlisted personnel and graduates being selected as cadets in recent

years. A dedicated CFR scheme for those enlisted personnel not eligible for a cadetship is being

advanced and will be held early in 2007. The outcome of this scheme will contribute to the


development of future policy for such schemes.

##### Para 4.5.5: Progress on Equality Issues


Since the publication of the White Paper the following are some of the advances that have been

made in this important area:


® An Equality Officer has been appointed within Defence Forces HRM Section;

® An Equality Policy and an Equal Status Policy have been formulated;


® The relevant Defence Forces Regulation (DFR) has been updated and amended;

® A section on Equality is now included in the New Entrants Information Handbook issued to


all inductees;


® The Defence Forces approach to multi-culturalism is now formulated.

##### Para 4.5.9, 4.5.10, 4.5.11: Civilianisation


The White Paper stated that civilianisation would “…. release personnel for operational duties for

which they are specifically trained…”( 4.5.9) and “…from essentially administrative

tasks….”(4.5.10). It also stated that “..operational considerations do require that core military

technical capabilities are retained within the Defence Forces” (4.5.10). Clearly, the objective of this

proposal was to free soldiers for operational duties and increase the operational capacity of the

Defence Forces. Some contracting out of services had taken place and has been found to be

successful, e.g. front-of-house catering. Options will continue to be explored on a civil/military basis

subject to the Government decision (4.3.19) that there would be no further review of the strength

of the Defence Forces in the lifetime of the White Paper.


**19**


-----

##### Para 4.4 and Chapter 6 : Overseas Operations:

The White Paper stated that “Overseas Operations have been an important dimension of meeting

Ireland’s international obligations, have significant training and morale-boosting benefits for the


Defence Forces and enhance this country’s standing on the international stage” (4.4.1).

6.3.6: Under the United Nations Stand-by Arrangements System (UNSAS) Ireland provides for up to

850 Defence Forces personnel to serve overseas at any one time. The same figure is pledged for

EU-led Peace Support missions in the ‘Palette of Forces’ offer to the Helsinki Headline Goal (HHG).

At 01 November 2006 the Defence Forces had a total 816 personnel serving overseas, including


units in Liberia, Kosovo and Lebanon.

6.3.11: Since 2000 the Defence Forces have fundamentally reviewed how they prepare and

undertake overseas deployments. Preparations for the provision of overseas units are based on the

‘Lead Brigade’ concept. Nominated Brigades have the responsibility for the provision of a Light

Infantry Battalion during its period on standby. This is normally for a period of twelve months,

incorporating a six month pre-deployment phase at home followed by a six month deployment

phase overseas. While the Lead Brigade concept does not mean that the overseas unit is drawn in

its entirety from a home battalion, it is broadly based on a home battalion and has proved to be an

effective tool in the preparation and provision of personnel to meet Government commitments to


overseas Peace Support operations.

In November 2006, the Government approved Ireland’s participation in the Nordic EU battlegroup

led by Sweden and which goes on standby in January 2008. The proposed Irish Defence Forces

contribution will involve an EOD/IEDD contingent with its own security detail, together with staff

posts at the Operational and Force headquarters. The total number of Defence Forces personnel

involved is expected to be somewhere between 80 and 100 which may arise should the battlegroup

be called on to undertake an operation. Any contribution to a battlegroup will be met within the

context of the overall ceiling of 850 personnel serving overseas at any one time. Joint training for

the Nordic battlegroup, including field manoeuvres, will take place in Sweden in

September/October 2007. This has been facilitated by an amendment to the Defence Act in 2006

that provides for, inter alia, training overseas. Preparation for and participation in the battlegroup

further underpins the progress made by the Defence Forces as well as the requirement to


continually develop the capability to undertake overseas missions, possibly at very short notice.

There have been significant other developments with regard to overseas missions since the White

Paper was published. As already stated, most missions are now mandated under Chapter VII of the

UN Charter. A rigorous review of overseas deployments was undertaken as recommended at

paragraph 6.3.2. As a result and in the light of political developments in the region, the Government

decided to withdraw the Irish Battalion from South Lebanon in October 2001, after a period of 23


years.


**20**


The Government then approved the Defence Forces undertaking a variety of short-term smaller

deployments in East Timor and Eritrea. These deployments broadened the skills base and exercised

the logistic requirement associated with such deployments that benefited the Defence Forces for

the larger and more significant deployments that followed (6 4 2)


-----

In 2003, reflecting its enhanced capability and increased interoperability, the Defence Forces were

in a position to deploy a mechanised Infantry Group to replace a small Transport Company in the

UN-authorised, NATO-led KFOR (Kosovo Force). An APC Company was deployed initially as part of

a Finnish/Irish Battalion and more recently has been operating independently in its own area of

responsibility as part of a Multi-National Task Force Centre (MNTF-C). In mid 2006 the Government

approved the assumption by the Defence Forces of ‘Framework Nation’ in MNTF-C, KFOR from

August 2007 for a period of one year. This is a significant undertaking and will challenge the

Defence Forces to further enhance capacity in this area.


The deployment to Liberia in November 2003 (UNMIL) under Chapter VII of the UN Charter

illustrated the enhanced capacity of the Defence Forces in personnel and equipment (6.4.13). The

mission was a new departure for the Defence Forces. It was expeditionary in that it required self
deployment to a green field site and self-sustainment on site. It was also the first time the Defence

Forces had provided an APC-mounted quick reaction force (QRF). Reconnaissance of the mission

area was conducted by a Special Operations Group (SOG), supported by a Naval service vessel.

Later, a Swedish mechanised company was successfully absorbed into the unit. In December 2005

the QRF’s remit was extended to include Sierra Leone by way of the provision of support for the

Special Court for Sierra Leone. The outstanding success of this challenging deployment highlights

the transformation of the Defence Forces.


The depth of progress achieved was further highlighted in 2006 as the Defence Forces responded

to the Governments decision to quickly deploy a unit to the enhanced UNIFIL mission in South

Lebanon. The Defence Forces deployed an Infantry Group of 158 personnel on 31 October 2006.

This Mechanised Group is operating as part of the fully integrated Finnish-Irish Battalion, with

Finland as the ‘lead nation’.


With the recent deployment to UNIFIL the Defence Forces have mechanised units serving

simultaneously in three different theatres: UNMIL in West Africa, KFOR in The Balkans and UNIFIL

in the Middle East. Additionally the Defence Forces have now deployed a full range of new ‘life

sustaining’ technologies, in order to make life in the harsh environments more endurable for the

deployed units. These technologies include such equipments as water treatment plants,

containerised ablutions and associated sewage treatment plants and internet cafes, (6.4.12)


In any given calendar year up to 2,000 personnel are either overseas, preparing to deploy or

returning from a tour of duty. The pre-deployment training for overseas missions in now a priority

requirement for our large troop contributing missions, with Mission Readiness Exercises (MREs)

being conducted for UNMIL, KFOR and now UNIFIL 2.


In addition to the personnel implications, these more demanding missions greatly increase the wear

and tear on the equipment deployed overseas. While the Defence Forces are very well equipped

as a result of the implementation of the White Paper the continued provision of resources for an

increased tempo of refurbishment and replacement of this crucial equipment will arise.

##### Para 4.6: Training and Interoperability:

The White Paper states that “The primary focus of the Defence Forces, when not engaged in

operations, is training and preparation” (4.6.1). In line with the recommendations of the White Paper

there have been significant improvements in training in both qualitative and quantitative terms. The


development of operational capability has been the overriding objective.

Participation in ESDP marked a new departure for Defence Forces personnel as they had no

previous involvement or experience working at the operational or military strategic levels. This was

complicated by the pace of development of military concepts and doctrine to support new thinking

on crisis management operations. The professional military education system was radically


overhauled to prepare Defence Forces personnel to meet the new challenges.

The Defence Forces train all corps for conventional operations to provide flexible capability to meet

all of the roles laid down by Government (4.6.1). In 2006 the Defence Forces conducted 56

collective training exercises, 300 different skills courses across the full spectrum of complexity from

pilot training to field catering courses, together with 25 career advancement courses for officers and


NCOs.

Increasing use is made of simulators and electronic simulation systems and the Defence Forces

participate in international computer based exercises such as the NATO/PfP VIKING series (4.6.3).

Robust and realistic collective training exercises are prepared, supported and conducted by

Brigades (4.6.2). Pre-deployment training packages including realistic Mission Readiness Exercises

are devised, conducted and validated to ensure that units proceeding on Chapter VII peace support

operations are thoroughly prepared. Since the publication of the White Paper, 5,875 personnel have


undergone such training prior to deploying on overseas missions.

Air Corps personnel are currently undergoing training on new aircraft. This includes Pilatus PC-9M


training aircraft, utility AW 139 helicopters and light utility EC 135 helicopters.

Naval Service Training is conducted by the Naval College at two centres. All aspects of military

training is conducted at the Naval Base and all aspects of professional training is conducted at the

National Maritime College of Ireland (NMCI). The remit of the Naval College and the focus of Naval

training is to prepare Naval personnel for the challenges of naval life in the 21st century. All of this

is achieved through basic, continuous and specialist training and education, benchmarked against


the highest relevant standards both nationally and internationally.

The Defence Forces have incorporated human rights training and modules on the Law of Armed

Conflict in all aspects of Defence Forces training. This approach, together with emphasis on the

dignity of the person and training in interpersonal relationships, is the foundation for an ethical base

for Defence Forces training which contributes in turn to operational capability. In 2005, the United

Nations Training School Ireland (UNTSI) was designated by the Chief of Staff as a centre of

excellence for training in Human Rights and the Law of Armed Conflict (LOAC). UNTSI conducts

courses for Defence Forces personnel and international students on the promotion and protection

of human rights in peace support operations. These courses are organised and conducted in


**23**


-----

conjunction with the Office of the UN Commissioner for Human Rights and the courses also receive

validation from that office. All Defence Forces career courses now include instruction on Human

Rights and LOAC and personnel travelling on peace support operations attend LOAC and Human

Rights lectures during pre-deployment training.


Fundamental to delivering effective operational capabilities is the leadership and management of

the personnel of the Defence Forces. Great emphasis has been placed on the requirement of the

White Paper that all Defence Forces personnel are provided with the opportunity for personal

development in order to realise their full potential during service (4.6.2). Since the White Paper the

Defence Forces have overhauled the induction-training regime at both recruit and cadet entry level.

Officer and NCO training has been extensively revised to ensure it is aligned with the most modern

international military best practice.


Officer and NCO career advancement courses now have academic accreditation at each appropriate

level in the National Framework of Qualifications. The new Cadet Course is being reviewed by

HETAC (Higher Education & Training Awards Council) for accreditation at level 7. A level 6 HETAC

accreditation is awarded to NCOs who complete career advancement courses up to and including

the Standard NCO Course. Senior Officers are educated to Masters level with accreditation from

National University of Ireland Maynooth and a Doctorate level part-accreditation is being negotiated

at present for a Defence Forces Strategic Leaders Course. Reflecting the importance of leadership

training for the Defence Forces, a Defence Forces Leadership Centre was established in 2004 as a

focus for leadership training throughout the organisation. Leadership doctrine, international best

practice and lessons learned are disseminated to all schools and colleges of the Defence Forces

through the aegis of the Centre. Seminars conducted there allow for reflection and discussion on

all aspects of leadership and management as it relates to the Defence Forces at home and on peace

support operations overseas.


The White Paper stated that the Defence Forces must continue to modernise its doctrine (4.6.4). A

Defence Forces Doctrinal manual was developed outlining the operational level principles required

to plan and conduct land operations through the full spectrum of possible conflict. It is the

organisation’s keystone document and, following approval by the Defence Forces Doctrinal Board,

it was issued by direction of the Minister for Defence in January 2001. As doctrine must be

assessed on a continuous basis, the Defence Forces is presently re-examining its doctrinal

requirements in the context of the changing nature of conflict and related technological

developments, including the examination of the development of a dedicated doctrinal development

centre.


The Defence Forces continue to chart a way forward for the development of doctrine, training

management and training structures and methodologies that will best serve the future needs of the

organisation. These include induction, continuation and collective training, infrastructure and

resources, electronic simulation systems and technological complexity.

##### Para 4.2.3. & 9.3.1: Pay to Non-Pay Ratio

The achievement and maintenance of a 70: 30 pay to non-pay ratio in the expenditure on defence

was identified by the White Paper as critical to ensuring a sustainable defence capability. The

reallocation of payroll savings from the reduction in strength of the PDF and the reinvestment of

the proceeds of the sale of Defence property have contributed to the achievement of the results

set out in the table below. This rebalancing has allowed the development of a significant planned

programme of infrastructural improvement and defence equipment procurement. Approximately

```
€200 million in pay savings and €95 million from sales of properties have accrued since 2000.

##### Para 4.9 and Chapter 9: Equipment and Establishment of HLPPG


The establishment of the High Level Civil-Military Planning and Procurement Group (HLPPG), (Para

4.9.5) has led to a more focussed and streamlined approach to the issue of defence procurement.

An ambitious and co-ordinated 10-year plan for defensive equipment procurement is now in place.

##### Para 4.7.1, 4.7.3, 4.7.4, 4.7.5, 4.7.6, 4.7.10 : Infrastructure

The Capital Expenditure available for the development and renovation of infrastructure for the

period 2000-2005 was made possible by pay savings arising from the reduction in numbers of

personnel and the sale of properties. Clancy Barracks was vacated on 21 December 2001 (4.7.1).

The issue of the multiplicity of locations (4.7.3) and the rationalisation of properties (4.7.6) remains

largely as described in the White Paper. Some ninety-one (91) married quarters have been sold at


Orchard Park in the Curragh since 2001 (4.7.10).

The infrastructural development programme undertaken in the period, valued at in excess of
```
€115m, was unprecedented and has led to a major improvement in facilities in all barracks and

```
installations in the Defence Forces.


Major upgrading of accommodation and training facilities was undertaken, including McKee

Barracks, Cathal Brugha Barracks, Sarsfield Barracks, Custume Barracks, Dun Ui Mhaoiliosa,

Kickham Barracks, and in the Defence Forces Training Centre.


Major improvements have also been made in the accommodation and services in the main training

areas in Coolmoney Camp and Kilworth Camp including the modernisation of accommodation units

and the installation of new water supply, fire fighting, and sewage systems. Accommodation, dining

and ablution facilities have also been upgraded in Bere Island.


A new sports centre (Gymnasium/Swimming Pool) was completed in the Defence Forces Training

Centre and a new Gymnasium constructed in Collins Barracks Cork.


Works carried out in Casement Aerodrome in the period include the upgrading of runways, the

modernisation of refuelling facilities, the construction of a new Hangar and a new headquarters

building for the Helicopter wing, and a new Transport Workshop. The construction of a new Avionics

Workshop is underway at present.


Projects undertaken in the Naval Base in Haulbowline include the upgrading of accommodation

facilities, the construction of a new Technical Stores and upgrading of fuel storage facilities.


Other projects undertaken in the period include the construction of a new Combined Vehicle

Workshop, garaging facilities for armoured vehicles, ammunition storage facilities and a new

Combat Support College in the Defence Forces Training Centre, new dining facilities in Dun Ui

Mhaoiliosa and Sarsfield Barracks, a new NCO’s Mess in Custume Barracks and the upgrading of

Privates Messes in Finner Camp, Collins Barracks Cork and Sarsfield Barracks.

##### Para 4.8.4 Statutory Authority for management of the Curragh

The Bill to establish the Curragh Authority is part of the current legislative programme.


##### Para 4.7.8: Decentralisation

In line with para 4.7.8 the Defence Forces’ main logistics base was decentralised from Dublin to

the Curragh in 2001 and the Directorates of Reserve and Military Police transferred to Kickham


Barracks, Clonmel in Oct 2002.

In line with the Government announcement on decentralisation in December 2003, Defence Forces

Headquarters will move to the Curragh Camp and the Department of Defence will move to

Newbridge, Co Kildare. The plans for the decentralisation to both locations are being advanced in


conjunction with the Office of Public Works.

##### Para 4.10: The Air Corps


The Air Corps new organisation structure with a manpower level of 930 has been fully

implemented. The command structure reflects that of the Defence Forces with separate operations

and support commands, each reporting to General Officer Commanding (GOC) Air Corps.


Para 4.10.9 recognised the “urgent equipment modernisation requirements in the Air Corps” and

since 2000 the following aircraft have been acquired:


® 1 x Learjet for Ministerial Air Transport Service in Dec 2003;

® 8 x PC-9M fixed wing aircraft to take over and enhance pilot ab-initio training, Air to Ground


Weapons qualification and Basic Fighter Manoeuvres training for instructors from 2004

onwards. A PC-9M fixed base simulator was part of the overall package;


® 2 x EC 135 helicopters for helicopter pilot training, limited military operations, operational

training and Air Ambulance in Nov 2005. These aircraft have proven to have excellent

reliability and have achieved a total flying hours output of 1,700 in the first 12 months in


service;


® Six (6) utility AW 139 helicopters are being acquired, two (2) of which were delivered in

November 2006. Each of these will be equipped with 2 x 7.62 calibre machine guns for

aircraft self protection and will have the capability to transport approx ten (10) fully equipped

troops. These will be operated by the Air Corps in a general purpose military operational and

training role, with their primary tasking being security and Aid to the Civil Power, military

exercises, training and operating with the Army Ranger Wing, infantry interoperability

training and limited troop transport. They will also be used to perform air ambulance, inland


**28**


Search and Rescue, aid to the civil community and VIP transport tasks;


-----

® A major mid-life upgrade of the two CASA CN235 maritime patrol aircraft will be carried out

in 2007 and 2008. This will incorporate a modern airborne search radar system; a modern

Forward Looking Infrared system and the CASA developed Fully Integrated Tactical System


(FITS);


® Comprehensive product support contracts have been put in place for the Learjet, PC9M’s

and EC 135’s and one is at an advanced stage of negotiation for the AW139’s;


® The 24/7 Search and Rescue (SAR) responsibilities of the Air Corps were terminated by

Government decision in December 2003;


® A successful service incentive scheme for pilots was introduced in 2002 (4.10.6 & 4.10.17);

® The Air Corps withdrew from Gormanston in Aug 2002 (4.10.18). This has resulted in an


increase in output from the Cessna FR172H aircraft previously stationed there and now

supported directly at Casement Aerodrome.


® Development of Casement Aerodrome (4.10.18): The Air Corps HQ located at Casement is

now fully functional and staffed in accordance with the new organisational structures. Other


infrastructural developments have been successfully completed as follows:

- Provision of new No.3 Operations (Helicopter Wing) HQ building;



- The provision of an Instrument Landing System;

- The provision of specialist workshop facilities building;



- The provision of a Flight Simulator building;

- Upgrade of the Crash Rescue Service with a new fire fighting / rescue vehicle and crews


trained to international standards. An on-site fire training / crash rescue training facility


has been installed and is now in service.

® Service Level Agreements (SLAs) are in place with the Departments of Justice, Equality and


Law Reform (Gárda Air Support Unit - GASU), Health and Children (Air Ambulance), and

Marine and Natural Resources (Fisheries) ( 4.10.20). The Air Corps has dedicated

considerable resources to these roles in order to achieve the agreed targets. In particular, in

meeting the GASU SLA requirements, Casement Aerodrome now operates on a 24 hour


basis and 15 pilots are deployed on a permanent basis to the GASU operation.

The Air Corps continues to offer a broad profile of air service to the Government, the Defence


Forces and Government Departments.

##### Para 4.11: The Naval Service

The White Paper specified that the Naval Service be based on an 8 ship flotilla and recommended

a ship replacement programme (4.11.5). The LE NIAMH was commissioned in 2001 costing some
```
€30m (4.11.6). Proposals are currently being considered for a replacement programme to provide

```
for retirement of up to 3 vessels in the next 4/5 years.


2005 marked the completion of a five-year implementation plan for improved patrolling activity,

which shows a 52% increase in patrol days at sea (4.11.9). 90% of that patrol time has been

allocated to fishery protection.


An extensive implementation plan designed to deliver on “…the effectiveness and efficiency

recommendations made by Price Waterhouse…” (4.11.10) was drawn up for the Naval Service and

approved by the Minister. Aspects of the Plan were:


® A new organisation structure with a manpower level of 1,144. The structure has separate

Operations and Support Commands, each reporting to the Flag Officer Commanding Naval


Service (FOCNS);


® A Service Level Agreement (SLA) with the Department of the Marine and Natural Resources

came into effect in January 2003. Additional SLAs with the Departments of Justice, Equality

and Law Reform, Health and Children, and Environment and Local Government are under


development;


® The service has embarked on a continuous, highly active recruitment programme, with a

dedicated Recruitment Officer;


® The Naval College has collaborated with Cork Institute of Technology in the establishment,

staffing and management of the National Maritime College of Ireland (NMCI). The NMCI is


now the centre of Naval Service non-military and professional maritime training;


® A programme of refurbishment has been completed in the accommodation blocks of the

Naval Base and a new Combined Operations and Support Building is being provided;


® The LIRGUARD fishery protection system project has been completed. This means that real

time information can be passed to ships on patrol. The National Fisheries Monitoring Centre


at Haulbowline is manned on a 24/7 basis.

##### Para 4.13: Other Defence Forces elements.


As acknowledged by the White Paper, the Army School of Music and the Equitation School make

important contributions not only to the affairs of the Defence Forces but also to the community and

the State. The Equitation School continues to promote the Irish Horse abroad through participation


**30**


-----

on the International show jumping and eventing circuits with considerable success. The Army

Bands are involved in a range of State ceremonial and community engagements. Some of the more

recent noteworthy events were the accession ceremonies for the ten new EU states in 2004 and

the 90th Anniversary Easter Parade in 2006.


##### Chapter 5: Reserve Defence Force (RDF)

The White Paper proposed fundamental changes for the RDF. Para 5.1 defines the need “...to build

a newly-focused RDF based on the strengths of the existing arrangements but which provides for

future needs through a radical new approach”. The new and revitalised Reserve was to be

organised and equipped on a similar basis to the PDF with a view to developing the interoperability


necessary to train and conduct operations jointly.

The Reserve Defence Force Review Implementation Board (RDFRIB) was convened in Nov 2000

and consulted widely with all stakeholders. The Minister approved the implementation plan in

principle, and the plan was formally launched in July 2004. The establishment was reduced to a

Non-Integrated strength of 9,292 personnel for the Army Reserve and a strength of 400 personnel

for the Naval Service Reserve. The White Paper also provided for a new ‘Integrated’ reserve to be

drawn from the non-integrated force. RDFRIB recommended that it should comprise some 2,656

personnel. The total Army Reserve would therefore comprise 11,948 and the Naval Reserve 400,

in all some 12,348 personnel (5.5.2). Forty-seven (47) units were effectively reduced to twenty
seven (27). This downsizing took place while raising the training standards and increasing the


outputs through the harnessing and harmonising of training assets in the PDF and RDF.

Para 5.5.1 of the White Paper defines the main role of the new Reserve Defence Force in

peacetime: “ In peacetime the main function of the RDF should be to train and prepare for these

contingency roles.” This has been implemented through the development of a strategic training

plan for the RDF and the inclusion of this plan in the Annual Training Directive (Para 5.8.4). The

training sets out targets for all units, provides for assessment of training, and focuses on developing


individual skills and unit capability.

The following are significant achievements to date:


® The new organisation of the non-integrated RDF was established on Oct 1st 2005;

® Four (4) RDF Lt-Cols have been appointed;


® A programme of standardisation of RDF dress and equipment (with the PDF) is under way.

All RDF personnel are now being issued with the Disruptive Pattern Material (DPM) Battle

Dress, and the Steyr AUG Rifle has become the standard issue weapon to the reserve.

Infantry Battalions & Company sized units are being equipped with the same weapons as


the PDF;


**31**


-----

® A system of unit affiliation with the PDF has been introduced;

® The proposals for the introduction and establishment of the integrated army reserve are


being progressed and the pilot phase will commence early in 2007;


® A study of the First Line Reserve and proposals for its future will be finalised in the context

of the integrated project;


® The Chief of Staff’s Annual Plan for the Defence Forces provides strategic direction with the

training strategy captured in the Annual Training Directive. Syllabi have been reviewed and

standards defined. These innovations will enhance Force Capability and lead towards the


development of interoperability with the PDF in some areas.

An important recommendation in the White Paper was that members of the Reserve should have

the opportunity to serve on overseas peace support operations. This recommendation is being

progressed in the context of the Reserve Defence Force Review Implementation Plan and policies

to support the selection of suitably qualified Reserve personnel for overseas service are being


developed over the lifetime of the plan.

##### Paras 7.5: Civil Defence


In the period 2000 to 2006, Civil Defence has continued to enhance its capabilities to respond to

emergencies as a high-quality second line service, in addition to facilitating community support

services (Para 7.5.1).


The increased funding provided for in the White Paper (Para 7.5.9, 7.5.5) has enabled the

organisation to procure additional vehicles, medical equipment, communications equipment, rescue

equipment and to provide enhanced training resources, all of which are key factors in the

enhancement of capability. The table below highlights spending over the period to end 2005.

-----

The organisation has continued to enhance its ability to operate in close support of the front-line

services (Para 7.5.2) and both local and annual exercises play an important role in such

development. Exercises are held at local, regional and national level and regularly involve inter
agency participation with both the statutory and the voluntary sector. The exercises provide the

organisation with a platform to assess the quality of training provided and to test the capabilities of

the organisation in the various local authority areas.


The Civil Defence Act was enacted in 2002 (Para 7.5.2) and the Civil Defence Board was

subsequently established in May 2003. The Minister for Defence continues to have overall

responsibility for Civil Defence policy. Responsibility for the strategic development of the

organisation now rests with the Civil Defence Board. The first strategic plan of the Civil Defence

Board, which was approved by the Minister, sets out the actions to be pursued over the period to

2007 to meet the policy goals for the Civil Defence organisation.


The Board is proactively addressing the difficulties facing the voluntary sector in both recruiting and

retaining membership and will be taking account of wider national policies to inform strategies for

maintaining the organisational strength (Para 7.5.3).


In line with the decision to decentralise Civil Defence Headquarters (Para 7.5.7), the executive of

the Civil Defence Board was re-located from Ratra House in the Phoenix Park, Dublin to Roscrea,

Co. Tipperary in May 2006.


##### Paras 8.3.15, 8.3.16, 4.9.5: Civil-Military Management

The Strategic Management Committee continues to meet regularly and provides a forum for the


discussion of strategic and policy issues.

The delegation of budgetary control to the Chief of Staff has continued with some 53% of non-pay

expenditure now delegated (9.5.1) together with the authority for recruitment and its associated


advertising finance (4.5.6).

##### Paras 8.3.4 – 8.3.12: Changes within the Department of Defence


This aspect of the White Paper deals primarily with the civilian element of the Department of

Defence and many of the changes recommended were linked to the broader Civil Service

modernisation agenda. The Department has continued to meet all targets associated with this

change agenda.


The Department has continued to re-focus on policy development and evaluation and a new three

Division structure has been introduced (8.3.10).


Civil Service Staff strength within the Department has been reduced by 13.5% to a current strength

of 388 whole time equivalents (8.3.10), this exceeds the 10% target set out in the White Paper.


The civil/military staffed Office of Emergency Planning was established post 9/11 and this was

achieved within existing staff resources.

Civilian personnel are employed in military barracks throughout the country, mainly providing

general operative, trades and other services to the Defence Forces. The number of these

employees has reduced over the period since the publication of the White Paper from approx. 1100

to a current authorised strength of 900 personnel (8.3.12).


In line with the commitment to better regulation and to meet the challenging programme for

legislation and for regulatory reform, a dedicated Legislation Branch was established within the

Department in 2005 from within existing resources. This has allowed a more focussed approach to

this important aspect of Defence management and significant progress has been made to date


(8.3.8).


A new Human Resources Strategy was produced in 2003 and this has led to significant

improvements in the management and focussed development of staff (8.3.11). The Department

was the first in the Civil Service to achieve the “Excellence through People” accreditation and has

continued to retain the accreditation through continuous improvement. The Department has also

achieved ISO 9001 accreditation and these achievements provide external validation of

Departmental performance in this area (8.3.8).


The Partnership process has been operating successfully in the Department.

The Performance Management and Development System has been successfully implemented

within the Department (8.3.8) and this has allowed a more focussed approach to staff development

and training as well as allowing for improved alignment and management of individual work targets,


Branch business plans and implementation of Departmental Strategy.

Pursuant to enhancements in HRM, departmental restructuring and in line with White Paper

recommendations, policy analysis and evaluation expertise has also been further developed within

the Department with staff qualifying in Policy Analyst courses at Diploma and Masters level as well

as qualifying in other appropriate courses (8.3.8). The Department has also developed a Business

Process Re-engineering / Improvement capability and studies of various Branches have led to

improved levels of customer service. This capability is also being utilised to assist the Branches in


their preparation for the challenges presented by decentralisation.

The development of Memoranda of Understanding (MOUs) and Service Level Agreements (SLAs)

has led to improved inter-departmental co-operation and provides a pragmatic mechanism for


addressing inter-departmental / inter-agency issues (8.3.8).

The Department’s internal audit unit continues to conduct annual programmes of audit and

enhancements to the staffing of this unit have occurred. The composition of the Audit committee

has changed in line with the recommendations laid out in the Mullarkey Report and this has further

strengthened the independence of the unit. (8.3.18). The Department has formalised risk

management as part of the annual Business Planning process and the Department’s Internal Audit

Unit played a key role in overseeing the development of risk management strategies. A number of

Expenditure Reviews have been carried out and a programme agreed with Department of Finance


to end 2008 (9.6.1, 9.6.2).

##### Overall Assessment.


It is useful at this point to re-visit the key goals of the White Paper:

® to provide a light infantry based force with an appropriate level of all-arms capability;


® To provide sufficient forces and capabilities to meet needs at home and to make a significant

contribution abroad;


® To put in place a more cohesive and better equipped force;

® To provide significant additional resources for equipment and infrastructure broadly within


the existing level of financial allocation.

The development strategy aimed at achieving these goals contained many detailed

recommendations. It is evident from the examination contained in Section 3, that most of the

recommendations for change have been implemented or are being implemented to agreed

timetables. It is reasonable to conclude therefore, that all the detailed targets should be achieved

within the timeframe of the White Paper. It is recommended that work continue on all fronts and


that particular areas, such as civilianisation, be given close attention.

Significant challenges have emerged in the defence and security environment in the period from

2000 to date and are detailed in this review. The Defence Forces are demonstrating the flexibility

and capacity to deliver the capability necessary to meet these new challenges. This is being

delivered from the reduced strength recommended in the White Paper. Important new Human

Resource practices have been introduced and the modernisation agenda of the Social Partnership

Agreements are ongoing. It is generally accepted that the defence and security environment will

remain changeable and demanding. In the light of this, commitment to resourcing and to continuous


improvement of the Defence organisation is critical.

The Defence Forces have demonstrated the capacity and interoperability to participate to good

effect in more complex and robust UN peace support operations including those led by regional

military frameworks. There is at present, concurrent participation in several such missions. Defence

Force capabilities have benchmarked positively against other military force standards in the context

of peace support operations. The assumption of the significant role of “Framework Nation”

responsibility with the KFOR mission and preparation for participation in the Nordic battlegroup will

build further on this capability. The Defence Forces have enhanced their contribution to the

response to international terrorism, including their particular role in relation to intelligence and in


developing Chemical, Biological, Nuclear and Radiological (CBRN) capabilities.

-----

The White Paper identified that “to a significant extent, defence is about preparing and maintaining

a capability to respond to contingencies and threats”. Benchmarked improvements in capability and

enhanced training outputs point towards greater productivity in this regard. The application of this

contingent capability in areas such as a 52% increase in Naval Service patrol days, continued Aid to

the Civil Power escorts and new demands for brigade level military assistance also point towards

greater efficiency and effectiveness.


The re-balancing of expenditure between pay and non-pay has enabled the required capability to be

maintained in a more efficient manner. However, attention must continue to be paid to maintaining

the required balance between pay and non-pay elements of the defence budget to ensure that it

remains within the parameters set in the White Paper.


The ongoing development of the Reserve Defence Forces is progressing according to an agreed

plan with a timetable out to 2009. This will provide a significantly enhanced Reserve capability.

Further work remains to be done within the timetable, including the roll-out of the integrated

reserve and the possible participation in peace support operations.


The recommendations in relation to Civil Defence have largely been implemented.

The Office of Emergency Planning was established after the White Paper, within existing resources,


to oversee the emergency planning process in general.

The White Paper recommendations relevant to the civilian element of the Department of Defence,

linked to the broader Public Service Modernisation agenda have been implemented and the


Department continues to meet all targets.

Overall it is reasonable to conclude that the goals outlined in the White Paper are being achieved

and the challenges that have emerged since the White Paper are being met. This leaves the

defence organisation well placed, in the period to 2010, to continue implementation of the

recommendations in specific areas and leverage maximum benefit from the changes that have

been made since 2000. This should provide a sound basis to meet the inevitable challenges that


will arise.
