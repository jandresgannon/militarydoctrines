WHITE PAPER ON DEFENCE
OF THE REPUBLIC OF SERBIA
Belgrade, 2010.

Defence is one of the most important functions of each state, because all other spheres of human activity aimed at creating basic preconditions for the overall development and prosperity overlap there. The Republic of Serbia, being an independent state since 2006, builds up its defence system tailored to meet its needs in the conditions characterizing the totality of relationships at the global, regional and local level. Year 2010 is a milestone in the reform of defence system, which is demonstrated through adoption of strategic-doctrinal and legal-normative documents, in the long and

![5_image_0.png](5_image_0.png)

![5_image_1.png](5_image_1.png)

medium term planning and programming of the defence system development, professionalization of the Serbian Armed Forces, the reform of the military education and military health care system, systematization and rationalization of the Ministry of Defence, revitalization of the defence industry and encouragement of participation of the Armed Forces and other defence forces members in building and maintaining peace in the world and the region.

White Paper on Defence is developed for the first time in the Republic of Serbia as an independent state. This is a document which transparently presents to the wide domestic and international public the processes, achievements and projections regarding the development of the defence system of the Republic of Serbia. Based on the right of each citizen of the Republic of Serbia to be informed on the defence system, the White Paper is a kind of text suitable for all generations of our people. At the same time, it represents a reasonably structured set of information for the interna4

tional public and the countries with which we have been developing cooperation.

![6_image_0.png](6_image_0.png)

The content of the White Paper on Defence offers a historical thread connecting the past to the present, provides a realistic description of the present situation and the projection of future development of the defence system. By preserving our traditions while using experiences of the most advanced systems, we are laying foundations for the vision and the projections of our defence system.

The vision of the defence system is based on the vision of a contemporary and modern Serbia, Serbia as an European Union member country, integrated into collective security systems, with the Armed Forces powerful enough to guarantee peace and stability in the region and participate with their capabilities in regional and global peace maintenance, with soldiers who can live on their work, committed to their job, and free from worries about their family's existence. Such a defence system enables us to join the community of responsible states and, as an equal, take a seat at the table with the countries and organizations to which we seek to become a member, as it will make a contribution to the efforts to transform the Republic of Serbia from a user to an exporter of security.

Modernization of Serbia and its defence system is our chance in

1 DEFENCE POLICY OF THE REPUBLIC OF SERBIA
레င

![11_image_0.png](11_image_0.png)

1. DEFENCE POLICY OF THE REPUBLIC OF SERBIA
Defence policy of the Republic of Serbia (RS) is based on strength-

![12_image_0.png](12_image_0.png)

11
ening of its own defence capacities, cooperation with democratic and peace-loving nations, the European orientation in foreign policy and the ability to play an active role in the processes of cooperation and joint efforts with other countries and actors in the international relations in building national, regional and global security.

The objectives of the defence policy of the Republic of Serbia are creation of an effective defence system, peace and favourable security environment, and integration into European and other international security structures. In order to achieve these objectives the Ministry of Defence (MoD) has undertaken the reform aimed at building an effective defence system, ensuring a stable operation of that system and creation of conditions for its interoperability with the systems of other countries included in European security structures and NATO Partnership for Peace programme.

1.1. SECURITY ENVIRONMENT OF THE REPUBLIC OF SERBIA
The security environment of the Republic of Serbia is characterized by a number of factors. The changes in the international relations that took place in the last decade of the 20th century were reflected in the global architecture of the world at the beginning of the new century and millennium. These changes became visible primarily in reconfiguration of relations between states and geostrategic regrouping at the global scene, which has contributed to a multipolar world building. 

In spite of the fact that in such conditions the risk of outbreak of a war at the global level almost does not exist, huge differences in the level of economic development, an ever increasing deficit of resources, impacts of climate changes, violation of the basic principles of international legal order and other challenges, risks and threats can still create a potential basis for emergence and spreading of local and regional conflicts. 

The essential feature of the contemporary world is the increasing interrelation and interdependence between the states at the global level. Considering the raising awareness of the need for joint actions aimed at facing the security challenges, risks and threats, this feature is particularly pronounced in the field of security and defence. It is further significantly supported by the fact that the modern challenges, risks and

![13_image_0.png](13_image_0.png)

threats increasingly exceed the traditional boundaries, become unpredictable and acquire a transnational character. Therefore, the principle of exclusive reliance on its own strength is often replaced or supplemented by the membership in one of the security integrations. 

The region of South-East Europe (SEE) entered this historic stage opting to undergo the transition process and committed itself to the European and Euro-Atlantic integrations. Although the security situation in the region has not been fully stabilized yet, the states in the region, pursuing their common primary interest to meet the necessary conditions for joining the European Union (EU), make efforts, through the active cooperation, to strengthen mutual trust and, taking its share of responsibility for safety of the common area, contribute to its overall development and welfare of their citizens.

NATO and EU will preserve their main roles in ensuring stability in the region of South-East Europe. Commitment of the countries in the region to join NATO and EU, as well as acceptance and promotion of the values of democracy, economic development and social stability and security, will continue to reduce the likelihood of conflict and will have a positive effect on the security environment. Regional security is increasingly based on joint and concerted actions in the field of security, politics and economics and other areas and it is aimed at preserving stability and prevention of crisis in the region. This contributes to reduction of the impact that inherited problems from the past, historical contradictions and consequences of conflicts in recent history between nations and countries in Southeast Europe, and especially in the Balkans, may have on the state of security.

In a changed strategic environment, the Republic of Serbia, faced with enormous challenges like no other country in the region, seeks to protect its territorial integrity through persistent efforts in foreign policy, using diplomatic and legal means, as well as to secure the appropriate position for itself in the international community and new security architecture of the region and the world. In this context, the illegal unilateral declaration of Kosovo independence is the biggest threat to the security of the Republic of Serbia, since it is an attempt to divide an UN member state against its will and contrary to the international law.

Aggression on the Republic of Serbia is considered almost unlikely, but, according to assessments, the security of the Republic of Serbia can 12

13
be jeopardized by armed insurgency, terrorism, separatist aspirations,

![14_image_0.png](14_image_0.png) national and religious extremism, organized crimes, natural disasters, chemical, biological, nuclear and technological disasters, cyber threats, intelligence activities, misuse of scientific knowledge in the area of genetic engineering, medicine, meteorology and other areas as well as by other threats. 

Republic of Serbia improves cooperation and establishes better and more meaningful relationships based on mutual trust with countries in the Western Balkans, particularly with neighbouring countries. However, the recognition of Kosovo's independence and establishment of diplomatic relations with it by certain countries in the immediate environment of the Republic of Serbia, as well as a number of countries in the world, has an adverse effect on the level of trust and cooperation, slowing down the stabilization process in this region.

1.2. INTERESTS OF THE REPUBLIC OF SERBIA 
IN THE DEFENCE AREA
The National Security Strategy has defined the list of the national interests of the Republic of Serbia in the field of security, thus determining the key preconditions for its overall democratic development.

Thus, the Republic of Serbia joined the ranks of the states with a determined development program concept and a clear vision of future achievements. 

The interests of the Republic of Serbia as the expression of the vital values and needs of its citizens, people and state are derived from the highest values defined by the Constitution of the Republic of Serbia and basic civilization achievements of the modern world. The key national value of the Republic of Serbia, which is the precondition for all other values, is preservation of its independence, sovereignty and territorial integrity. 

Defence interests of the Republic of Serbia have been defined for the first time in the Republic of Serbia as an expression of the highest values of our state and its people to build and maintain security and stability as essential prerequisites of a free and democratic development of the society. They include: the preservation of the sovereignty and independence and territorial integrity of the Republic of Serbia and security and protection of its citizens; confidence building; improvement of re-

![15_image_0.png](15_image_0.png)

gional security and stability and cooperation and partnership with international security organizations and institutions of democratic states.

In this context, the defence policy, as a synthesis of views expressed through the basic commitments, goals, tasks and the strategic defence concept, aims at developing appropriate internal and external, political, economic, social, military and other conditions for the preservation and protection of those defined interests of the Republic of Serbia.

This policy reflects the commitment of the Republic of Serbia to build and strengthen its own capacities and capabilities for defence and, together with other countries to strengthen national, regional and global security through integration into European and other international security and defence structures.

![15_image_1.png](15_image_1.png)

1.3. STRATEGIC DEFENCE CONCEPT OF THE REPUBLIC 
OF SERBIA
15
The strategic defence concept is determined on the basis of the

![16_image_0.png](16_image_0.png)

orientations and goals of the defence policy, assessments of the challenges, risks and threats, as well as new social and international roles of defence potentials. This concept is the basis for the design of the defence system of the Republic of Serbia and it presents the main positions of the Republic of Serbia towards engagement of the available resources for safeguarding and protection of its defence interests.

The basic elements of the strategic defence concept of the Republic of Serbia are based on application of total defence system, through a joint engagement of the defence actors and defence capacities. The concept fully appreciates the need for strengthening partnership and multilateral cooperation with other countries and international organizations and institutions in safeguarding and protection of the defence interests of the Republic of Serbia. 

Depending on the types and intensity of the security challenges, risks and threats, the Republic of Serbia shall protect its defence interests primarily by deterrence, using joint and effective defence system. In addition, a reliable partnership and cooperation in building a favourable security environment significantly contributes to protection of the defence interests and to a resolute defence of the nation by our own forces and with the partners' assistance. Participation in multinational operations aimed at building and maintaining peace in the region and worldwide, as well as providing support to civilian authorities in combating security threats, are also significant aspects of the defensive resources engagement in protection of national interests.

In order to support the efforts of the Republic of Serbia to become

![20_image_0.png](20_image_0.png)

19
a promoter of stability and peace in the region of South East Europe, the Government has set defence system reform as one of its priorities. The reform is a continuing and transparent process being implemented on the basis of the defined defence policy with the aim to adjust the defence system and, considering capacities of the Republic of Serbia, make it capable of facing security challenges, risks and threats, meet the needs of citizens, and bring it into line with the generally accepted democratic standards and trends in security organization of the contemporary states. A modernized, efficient and economically sustainable defence system is a significant potential of the Republic of Serbia. 

Passing of the system laws and regulations related to defence and adoption of the strategic and doctrinal documents (National Security Strategy of the Republic of Serbia, Defence Strategy of the Republic of Serbia and Doctrine of the Serbian Armed Forces) have created the necessary prerequisites for further institutional improvement of the defence system.

2.1. STRATEGIC AND DOCTRINAL DOCUMENTS
Development of the basic strategic documents is one of the most important steps which the Ministry of Defence has taken towards the strategic, doctrinal, organizational and functional regulation in the field of security and defence in the Republic of Serbia. At the session held on October 26, 2009, the National Assembly of the Republic of Serbia, passed **National Security Strategy of the Republic of Serbia and Defence** Strategy of the Republic of Serbia.

The adoption of the National Security Strategy and Defence Strategy of the Republic of Serbia, for the fist time in the Republic of Serbia as an independent state, specified the national interests in the sphere of security, vital defence interests, and fundamental orientation, goals and tasks of the national security policy and defence policy. These documents also define the structure of the national security system and defence system of the Republic of Serbia. 

National Security Strategy, as, in terms of hierarchy, the highest and most important strategic document in the field of national security and defence of the Republic of Serbia, defines the basis of the national

![21_image_0.png](21_image_0.png)

security policy related to protection of the national interests of the Republic of Serbia, i.e. independence, sovereignty and territorial integrity of the Republic of Serbia, protection of national identity of its citizens, development of democratic process in the society and the rule of law, respect of human and minority rights, economic, technological and cultural progress, protection of life and health of its people, protection and conservation of environment, as well as other resources and assets of the Republic of Serbia. 

Among the main orientations of the national security policy of the Republic of Serbia, the following should be pointed out: commitment to the respect of the Charter of the United Nations (UN), adherence to the principles of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and the Helsinki Final Act; commitment to the respect of the international law, strengthening of the role of the United Nations (UN), Organisation for Security and Cooperation (OSCE) and the European Union (EU), and creation of mechanisms for maintenance of security in the world; determination of the Republic of Serbia to use diplomatic and legal means and any other legitimate means to protect its sovereignty and territorial integrity, based on its commitment not to recognize unilaterally declared independence of Kosovo and Metohija; readiness to improve its relations with other states through cooperation and joint efforts, and to harmonize, in the process of European integration, its foreign, security and defence policy with the approaches and activities of the EU; determination to contribute to the shared democratic values and enhancement of regional and global stability by participating in NATO Partnership for Peace programme; as well as to develop and advance all security aspects, and especially human, societal, energy, economic, environmental and other contents of integral security of the Republic of Serbia. 

Defence Strategy of the Republic of Serbia is the key strategic document of the Republic of Serbia in the field of defence. It provides the basis for defence system organization and exercise of the defence function of the state. The Defence Strategy is based on the Constitution and the National Security Strategy of the Republic of Serbia and is intended for all citizens, government agencies and other actors involved in preparation and organization of defence and defence activities. As the most general state document in the field of defence, the Defence Strategy is the basis for the development of normative, doctrinal and organizational solutions in the defence system.

20

The Defence Strategy reflects the commitment of the Republic of

![22_image_0.png](22_image_0.png)

21
Serbia to build and strengthen its own capacities and capabilities for defence, and that, through integration into European and other international security and defence structures, act jointly with other countries in

![22_image_1.png](22_image_1.png)

order to enhance national, regional and global security.

For the first time, the Defence Strategy clearly defines the structure of the defence system of the Republic of Serbia within the national security system. The defence system is a joint, structurally organized and functional system of defence forces and actors, designed to protect the defence interests of the Republic of Serbia.

The Doctrine of the Serbian Armed Forces is made on the basis of the Defence Strategy of the Republic of Serbia. The President of the Republic of Serbia signed the decision on adoption of this document on February 25, 2010. The Doctrine of the Serbian Armed Forces is the basic doctrinal document defining the general orientation in military activities, organization, preparations, use and support of the Serbian Armed Forces in peacetime, wartime and emergencies. The Doctrine of the Serbian Armed Forces sets a theoretical framework for use of military power of the Republic of Serbia, as it deals with organization, preparation and joint operational concept of the use of the Serbian Armed Forces, provides a platform for unified actions of all members of the Serbian Armed Forces, and basis for harmonization of other doctrinal documents, decisions, rules, instructions, orders, teaching and other materials related to the military activities.

The institutional framework enabling organization and operation

![23_image_0.png](23_image_0.png)

of a unique defence system was established in the Republic of Serbia by passing the **Law on Defence** and **Law on the Serbian Armed Forces**,
and other system laws. At the same time, new legislation has contributed to the acceleration of the reforms that have already been initiated in the defence system, the process of professionalization of the Serbian Armed Forces, continuation of modernization and upgrading of operational and functional capabilities of the Serbian Armed Forces and the entire defence system. All the legal decisions made in the previous period are in line with the Constitution, laws and principles of international law governing the use of force, the Charter of the United Nations and the ratified international treaties in the sphere of defence and military cooperation which are, according to the Constitution, an integral part of the legal order of the Republic of Serbia.

The Law on Defence establishes a unique defence system of the Republic of Serbia, defines the responsibilities in defence of the state authorities and the Serbian Armed Forces, and the rights and duties of state authorities, autonomous provinces, local authorities, citizens, companies, other legal persons and entrepreneurs with respect to defence. The Law on the Serbian Armed Forces specifies the position and responsibilities of the Serbian Armed Forces (SAF), and the organization, composition and principles of action of the Serbian Armed Forces; defines specific features of military service, command and control over the Serbian Armed Forces, ranks and titles in the Serbian Armed Forces, the symbols and insignia of the Serbian Armed Forces, military holidays, religious service, democratic and civil control, transparency, service in the Serbian Armed Forces and other issues of importance to the Serbian Armed Forces.

The **Law on the Use of the Serbian Armed Forces and Other Defence Forces in Multinational Operations Outside the Borders of the Republic of Serbia** regulates the use and preparation of the Serbian Armed Forces and other defence forces, primarily the formations of the Ministry of Internal Affairs and other state bodies and agencies, for participation in multinational operations abroad. This is an important factor given the complexity of contemporary multinational operations and the need, as experience confirmed, for involvement of other civilian institutions, along with the deployment of armed forces, in those operations. This Law harmonizes the responsibilities in managing the joint defence system of the Republic of Serbia with the responsibilities established by the 22

23
Constitution, the Law on Defence and Law on the Serbian Armed Forces.

![24_image_0.png](24_image_0.png)

In this way, the necessary conditions have been created allowing for deployment of the Serbian Armed Forces abroad, based on the decision of the National Assembly of the Republic of Serbia, and in accordance with the needs of national defence.

The **Law on Military, Labour and Material Obligations** and the Law on Civil Service provide for efficient functioning of military, labour and material obligations in general, and regulate civil service, in accordance with the Constitution, laws and the guaranteed right to conscientious objection.

The **Law on Military Security Agency and Military Intelligence**
Agency regulates responsibilities, activities, tasks, powers, supervision and control of the Military Security Agency and Military Intelligence Agency, as well as cooperation and other issues of importance to their work. In the changed security environment, the solutions provided by that law ensure modern mechanisms for execution of security-intelligence operations, up to the highest international democratic standards, recommendations and procedures.

Data Secrecy Law governs the unique system of identification and protection of classified information being important for national and public security, defence, interior and foreign affairs of the Republic of Serbia, protection of foreign classified information, access to classified information and termination of their confidentiality, authorities of the relevant bodies and control over implementation of this law, as well as responsibility for the non-fulfilment of this law, and other issues of importance for protection of data confidentiality.

2.3. DEFENCE PLANNING
Defence planning is an important mechanism for efficient implementation of the reform and includes planning of the defence system development and planning of the use of the defence forces. The main planning documents in the defence field are: Long Term Defence System Development Plan of the Republic of Serbia, Strategic Defence Review of the Republic of Serbia and Defence Plan of the Republic of Serbia.

In 2009, the System of Planning, Programming, Budgeting and Execution (PPBE) was introduced by the Ministry of Defence and Serbian Armed Forces as the main model of defence planning. Based on the Law on Defence and Regulation on Planning, Programming, Budgeting and Execution in the Ministry of Defence and the Serbian Armed Forces, Long Term Defence System Development Plan has been developed, 해

![25_image_0.png](25_image_0.png)

25
Strategic Defence Review has been adopted, and Mid-term Defence

![26_image_0.png](26_image_0.png) System Development Plan and Programmes have been developed and adopted, along with the Main Programmes and Mid-term Plans for office holders in the defence system.

Long Term Defence System Development Plan of the Republic of Serbia is a defence planning document which defines the strategic orientation in developing the defence system of the Republic of Serbia, necessary capabilities of the Serbian Armed Forces, content and dynamics of organizational changes, human and material resources development, defence system financing and other issues that are important for operation of the defence system. 

Strategic Defence Review is the programme basis which defines mid-term defence planning, efficient defence resources management, transparency of defence issues and creation of conditions needed for democratic and civilian control, professionalization and effectiveness of the Serbian Armed Forces in accomplishing missions and tasks assigned to them. At the same time, this document is the basis for development of other documents by which activities on building of new defence system capacities of the Serbian Armed Forces are operationalized. 

Mid-term Defence System Development Plan and Programmes is the document which combines the goals of operation and development of the defence system and the ways to achieve them. It is based on the primary orientation of the defence policy, analysis of relations between defence needs and capabilities of the Republic of Serbia and forecasted financial framework in the upcoming mid-term planning period. Midterm Defence System Development Plan and Programmes combines and generalizes the basic elements and commitments of the main programmes. This document provides a framework for short-term defence planning, efficient resources management and conditions for effective and efficient functioning of the Serbian Armed Forces and other defence forces in accomplishing the assigned missions and tasks.

In accordance with the Regulation on Planning, Programming, Budgeting and Execution in MOD and SAF, and by the decision of the Minister of Defence, the Defence Planning Council was formed as the highest advisory body to the Minister of Defence, which considers issues related to defence planning.

Regarding short-term planning, the main documents of the Ministry of Defence are: Ministerial Guidance, Annual Plans of Defence System Office Holders and Annual Plans of internal organizational units of the Ministry of Defence and commands, units and institutions of the Serbian Armed Forces. 

Organization and reform of the defence system are continuous and

![27_image_0.png](27_image_0.png)

dynamic processes implying organizational and functional changes in the defence system, aimed at building a more efficient and more economical system. Significant results have been achieved in maintenance and development of the existing and new operational and functional capacities through organizational and functional changes in the defence system and the Serbian Armed Forces, professionalization of the Armed Forces, modernization and equipping with modern combat means, intensification of collective and individual training, participation in multinational operations, and activities carried out within NATO programme Partnership for Peace. 

The existing organization of the Ministry of Defence is harmonized with the standards and organizational solutions applied in other modern states. During the reforms of the defence system, changes of organizational structure of the Ministry of Defence and the Serbian Armed Forces have been initiated and continuously introduced in order to optimize their operation, establish an efficient defence system management, rationalize number of jobs and balance the ratio of military and civilian personnel, and ensure consistent application of the principles of democratic and civilian control.

The current organizational structure provides functional integration of the Ministry of Defence and General Staff. The Serbian Armed Forces General Staff (SAF GS) is directly subordinated to the Minister of Defence. Considering the areas of responsibilities and the principles of democratic and civil control, in addition to the General Staff, some other organizational units, such as the Defence Inspectorate, Military Security Agency, Military Intelligence Agency, Public Relations Department, Department of Health, etc. are also directly subordinated to the Minister of Defence.

Organizational changes in the Serbian Armed Forces take place in accordance with the modern principles and standards of organization and operation of the military organization, but also in line with the emerging needs generated by professionalization of the Armed Forces, the necessity to enhance operational and functional capacities, and the principle of financial sustainability.

rated from the Ministry of Interiors and subordinated to the newly established *General Military Administration*. An independent Ministry of War with general military, administrative-economic and control sections was established in 1861. After disbanding the *Main General Staff* in 1897, the Ministry of War consisted of nine sections: general military affairs, artillery, engineers, economy, treasury, medicine, care for the disabled, military judiciary and control. In the Kingdom of Serbs, Croats and Slovenes, later the Kingdom of Yugoslavia, the Armed Forces were controlled by the Ministry of Army, with almost the same composition as in the Kingdom of Serbia. The law passed in 1923 changed the denomination to the Ministry of Army and Navy. In SFRY those issues fell within the remit of the Federal Secretariat of National Defence. 

Today, the Ministry of Defence, as the state authority of the Republic of Serbia, is composed of four sectors (Defence Policy Sector, Human Resources Sector, Material Resources Sector and Budget and Finance Sector), three separate internal units (General Staff, Secretariat and Cabinet of the Minister of Defence), four internal units outside the sectors and the Secretariat (Public Relations Department, Military Health Department, Internal Auditing Section and the Chief Service Inspector) and three administrative bodies within the Ministry (Defence Inspectorate, Military Security Agency and Military Intelligence Agency).

The existing organizational structure of the Ministry of Defence, established in early 2010, has ensured the proper management of the defence system and full democratic and civilian control over the Serbian Armed Forces and the military security services, accelerated information flows, reduced number of organizational units, rationalized number of jobs, balanced ration between military personnel, civil and military servants and employees, and integrated issues related to the military, labour and material obligations. The new organization of the Ministry of Defence has enabled the Armed Forces command system, as well as other elements of the system, to become more efficient and simpler. At the same time, the flexible organization of the Ministry of Defence allows for rapid response to the requirements.

Defence Inspectorate (DI) is an administrative body within the

![35_image_0.png](35_image_0.png)

Ministry of Defence tasked to perform inspections related to implementation of decisions and documents issued by President and Government of the Republic of Serbia; to coordinate preparations for defence; to establish and coordinate organization and connections; and deal with other issues as stipulated by law. 

The defence inspection function was introduced for the first time in the Kingdom of Serbia in 1894, when "Inspectorates" were formed. In 1911 the "Main Inspection of the Whole Army" was established. The inspection in defence as function was also developing later in the Kingdom of Yugoslavia and the post-war Yugoslavia. 

The Director runs operation of DI, which consists of the organizational units responsible for planning, organization and making inspections of operational and functional abilities, material and financial operations and construction works, health and safety at work, environment protection, fire and explosion protection and preparations for defence of the defence system actors, as defined by law and defence obligations (military, labour and material). 

Since 2010 defence industry companies have been subject to health and safety, environment protection and fire and explosion protection inspections. In cooperation with other responsible authorities, ministries and inspection agencies, integrated inspections are also conducted. 

Quality, objective and timely presentation of the situation in subjects and areas of inspection help the management and command to make the right decisions in order to rectify irregularities, improve the condition and ensure compliance with the laws and regulations. In addition, by educating those in organization being inspected, the inspection authorities contribute to a better understanding of the regulations and work standards, thus improving the quality of controlled entities, reducing defects and risks of illegal, unplanned and inefficient use of budget funds.

With this approach, the implementation of inspection activities creates the conditions for attainment of the general objectives defined by the Ministry of Defence, falling into the remit of the Defence Inspectorate, which is primarily reflected in the achieved contribution to security of the Republic of Serbia, maintenance of the operational capability of the Serbian Armed Forces at the required level and improvement of living and working conditions of the defence system members.

Military Security Agency (VBA/MSA) is the security service of the

![36_image_0.png](36_image_0.png)

Republic of Serbia responsible for security and counter-intelligence protection of the Ministry of Defence and the Serbian Armed Forces.

The development of security and intelligence activities in Serbia started during the First Serbian Uprising. 12th November is celebrated as the day of MSA, commemorating enacting of the first Military Law in 1839, which specified the forms of threats and security protection of the army. In the Kingdom of Serbs, Croats and Slovenes, and later in the Kingdom of Yugoslavia, security-intelligence system was established in the way that those issues were dealt with within the Ministry of the Army and Navy. During the World War II, Section of People Protection was formed to carry out security and counter-intelligence tasks. In 1944 Department of People Protection (OZNA) was established. After the war in 1946, Counter-Intelligence Service (KOS) was formed. It changed its name in 1955 to Security Bodies of YPA. Based on the Law on Security Services of the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia, passed on 2nd July, 2002, Security Bodies were renamed to Military Security Service, which was then separated from the General Staff and subordinated to the Ministry of Defence. 

As the Armed Forces and the Ministry of Defence developed, the structure, organization and names of the security service were changing until 2002, when, by the order of the Mister of Defence issued on 29th September, Military Security Agency was established. 

Operation of the Military Security Agency is regulated by the Law on the Military Security Agency and Military Intelligence Agency and the by-laws for its implementation. Within its responsibilities, the Military Security Agency assesses security risks and threats that can threaten the functioning of the Ministry of Defence and the Serbian Armed Forces.

The Agency carries out tasks related to security protection of forces, facilities and activities, protection of data confidentiality, security checks, industrial security and security of information systems and computer networks, telecommunications, and crypto protection. Apart from security, MSA performs counterintelligence tasks and duties, such as protection of the Ministry of Defence and the Serbian Armed Forces from terrorist, extremist and foreign intelligence services activities, combating organized crimes and corruption, research and documenting of war crimes, and counter-intelligence protection of persons, facilities and activities.

MSA operates under the supervision and control of the National Assembly of the Republic of Serbia, President of the Republic, Government, National Security Council, Minister of Defence, courts, other state

![37_image_0.png](37_image_0.png) agencies and the public.

The MSA organizational structure consists of organizational units for operations, analytics, support, general affairs, internal control and MSA centres. 

MSA human resources are composed of highly educated personnel, specially trained and qualified to perform security and counterintelligence tasks. In order to be able to perform tasks and duties within its responsibility, MSA is equipped with modern operational and technical assets, which require specific knowledge and skills of its members. Special attention is given to the further development of personnel in a specialized MSA Centre and institutions of higher education in the country and abroad. The modernization of the operational and technical assets, in accordance with the latest scientific and technological achievements, is the imperative for MSA in efficient and effective performance of security and counterintelligence protection of the Ministry of Defence and the Serbian Armed Forces. 

While performing its tasks and duties, the Military Security Agency successfully cooperates with the competent authorities, organizations and agencies of the Republic of Serbia, and with the security services of other countries and international organizations. In this way, MSA contributes to a continuous improvement of national security and maintenance of the regional and global stability. 

Military Intelligence Agency (VOA/MIA), as an important segment of security and intelligence system of the Republic of Serbia, performs the tasks within its area of responsibility, aiming to contribute to taking an objective view of the processes affecting the security and international position of the Republic of Serbia. 

External Section of Operations Department of the Main General Staff was established on 5th March, 1884. It was than that military intelligence activities were institutionally integrated for the first time in the modern Serbian state. Preparing for the great liberation wars from 1912 to 1918, the Main General Staff formed the Supreme Command Headquarters, which comprised Operations Department, with the Intelligence Section being a part of it. When the General Staff of the Yugoslav Army was established on 1st May, 1945, the Intelligence Section was formed as its part. In 1947 it evolved into the General Staff Second Department, which over 50 years in the turbulent times of the Cold War, throughout conflicts in the ex Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia 36

37
and during the aggression against the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia,

![38_image_0.png](38_image_0.png) remained the main actor in the field of military intelligence work. The Second Department became Military Intelligence Agency of the Ministry of Defence in 2004. Today, the Agency continues to cherish the heritage of military intelligence service while being fully aware of its responsibility and importance of its work for the sake of safety of all citizens and protection of the interests of the Republic of Serbia. 

MIA is responsible for intelligence work being important for defence, and which includes gathering, analysis, assessment, protection and provision of data and information on potential and real threats, activities, plans and intentions of foreign states and their armed forces, international organizations, groups and individuals. In addition, MIA
guides intelligence and reconnaissance components of the Armed Forces (J-2) in order to deliver timely information based on the date collected by electronic means. 

Seeing democratic and civil control of the security and intelligence system as the prerequisite of democratic development of the society, MIA has actively contributed to strengthening of supervising instruments. In addition to the existing mechanisms for the control of the Agency's work, carried out by the legislative and executive authorities
(Defence and Security Committee and Inspector General of the Ministry of Defence), there is also the internal control service within MIA.

MIA is composed of commissioned and non-commissioned officers and military servants who are recruited by the Agency through an open competition and based on their personal preferences. Agency staff is highly motivated and ready for the challenges and responsibilities that the dynamic, exciting and very responsible work brings. Given the complexity of the tasks performed by MIA, on the admission of candidates strict criteria are applied to ensure the selection of the highest quality staff, with a predisposition for the proper performance of work in the field of intelligence activities. 

Therefore, the persons selected to work with the Agency are characterized by psychophysical stability, resourcefulness, adaptability, flexibility and creativity. In addition to higher education at military academies and civilian schools, most members of the Agency have completed postgraduate studies, and specific forms of professional training in intelligence activities in the country and abroad. Following trends of gender equality, 20% of the Agency staff is women, with the possibility that this number will be increased.

A comprehensive transformation of the ways in which MIA carries

![39_image_0.png](39_image_0.png)

out missions and tasks has already been initiated to bring organizational, technical, personnel and technological improvements into intelligence activities. The recent changes have transformed MIA to a modern intelligence service to suit the realistic needs and capabilities of the defence system. Organization of the Agency results from application of experiences of the military intelligence services across the world, and the need to functionally connect organizational units based on similarity of their operations. This provides increased efficiency and rationalization of work. In this regard, the Agency is made up of three key units tasked with data collection, analytical operations and support.

Special attention is given to the development of personnel who may be engaged in performance of military diplomatic tasks. Those persons will act in an effectively built network of defence representatives, extended to the regions where units will deploy to participate in peace support operations, but also in the countries where there is a strong economic interest of the domestic defence industry.

MIA operates in accordance with the established national policy of building good neighbourly relations. In this regard, cooperation with the foreign intelligence services, particularly those from the region, should provide effective opposition to the current and future challenges, risks and threats.

threats and perform other missions and tasks in accordance with the Constitution, laws and principles of international law governing the use of force.

The tradition of the Serbian Armed Forces is founded on liberation uprisings (First and Second Serbian Uprising) in 19th century. The beginning of modern military organization dates back to 15 February 1804, when struggle of Serbian people for liberation started in Orasac. On the same day in 1835, Prince Milos Obrenovic declared the first Serbian Constitution, which at the time was considered to be among the most liberal and most modern in the whole of Europe. Since 2007, this date has been celebrated as the Day of Statehood of the Republic of Serbia, and the Day of the Serbian Armed Forces. In this way the continuity of military organization in Serbia is pronounced and a firm connection between the Serbian state and armed forces clearly indicated. 

Owing to the strategy of armed people, Serbia was internationally recognized as an independent state at the 1878 Berlin Congress.

Throughout 19th century the autonomous Principality and later Kingdom of Serbia developed the system of people's army that was to become stationary army. Introduction of stationary army and subsequent modernization and education of the cadre in European countries laid stable foundations of a high quality military organization. The results of those strategic decisions became evident in the victorious wars at the beginning of 20th century (the First and Second Balkan Wars and World War I). When the new state - the Kingdom of Serbs, Croats and Slovenes, later the Kingdom of Yugoslavia - was created in 1918, Serbia brought its statehood into it and foundations of the new army rested on the victories of the Serbian army in the preceding war. 

The Serbian Armed Forces officially came into being on June 8, 2006, by a Decree of the Republic of Serbia Government. At present it has 28,000 members.

The missions and tasks of the Serbian Armed Forces are defined by the Defence Strategy of the Republic of Serbia, and are based on the inalienable rights of the Republic of Serbia on individual and collective defence, in accordance with Article 51 of the Charter of the United Nations and fundamental principles of the international law governing the use of force.

threats, resources, missions, tasks and international standards. Organization also determines the fundamental principles, type of armed forces, functional and organizational structure and command. The Serbian Armed Forces (SAF) develop their own training and logistic system, resting on the resources available in the country. 

The Armed Forces are structurally divided into arms of service, branches and services, and functionally organized into commands, units and institutions, at strategic, operational and tactical level. 

At the strategic level, the Serbian Armed Forces are commanded and led by the President of the Republic, the Minister of Defence and the Chief of the General Staff. At the operational level, arms of service commands, training command and other operational command, with the organization adapted to the organization of the General Staff, are in charge of command and leading. At the tactical level, command and leadership is executed by the brigade commands and commands of the units of the equal level with the organization adapted to the commands of operational level. 

Arms of service are integrated organizational units of branches and services which are relatively autonomous in their combat activities on the land and in the air. Arms of service in the Serbian Armed Forces are Army and Air Force and Air Defence. 

Branches are: infantry, armour, artillery, engineers, artillery and rocket units for antiaircraft defence, aviation, river units and electronic warfare units. 

Services in the Serbian Armed Forces are divided into general and logistic. The general services are: personnel, telecommunications, air 42

43

international missions and support to civilian structures, require a different approach toward development and management of the armed forces. The trends and experiences have shown that new technologies and new combat systems are getting more expensive while training and education of troops are becoming even more complex and longer. 

According to the Strategic Defence Review, the aims of the defence policy should be attained through many tasks, with **professionalization of the armed forces** being one of the most important. The goal of professionalization is to achieve the designed level of the armed forces readiness for execution of their missions and tasks in cooperation with other forces within the defence system and partners' armed forces. 

In late 2008, the implementation of the guidelines for Strategy of manning the Serbian Armed Forces with professional soldiers began.

With the aim of full professionalization of SAF, the Decision on organization and mobilization changes in the Ministry of Defence and Serbian Armed Forces was passed in August 2009, replacing the positions of national serviceman with the positions of professional soldiers, thus creating necessary prerequisites for completion of professionalization of

![45_image_0.png](45_image_0.png) the Serbian Armed Forces.

The achieved level of professionalization has made it possible to reduce recruitment of conscripts, allowing for creation of preconditions for termination of national military service. As the number of newly recruited professional soldiers was rising, the number of the recruited national serviceman was successively reduced from 5,000 in 2006 to 1,500 in September 2010. 

Recruitment and selection procedure for admittance to professional military service is specific in comparison to other professions. For that reason, the process may last several months and includes: selection of personnel, medical check ups by consultants, security checks, and eventually training of the candidates for the duties to be performed once they enter the service. 

Professionalization also implies training for the duty, testing of competences, retraining and acquiring of knowledge. In the conditions of full professionalization, the Armed Forces are manned with professional soldiers by recruiting the candidates who have completed their national service, are involved in voluntary military training, or civilians who have not completed any military training. All of them, prior to ad-

![45_image_1.png](45_image_1.png)

45
mittance to the professional military service, will have to undergo the

![46_image_0.png](46_image_0.png) appropriate training. During the training, psycho-physical and military and professional competences are evaluated. Only when they meet the set criteria, they will be allowed to become professional members of the Serbian Armed Forces.

Professional armed forces need a brand new concept of training.

Instead of cyclic training of conscripts serving in the military, based on the uniformed soldier and unit training plans and programmes for specific branches and services, a new training model was introduced. It is oriented toward attaining the prescribed standards of individual abilities and abilities of units to perform the assigned missions. This concept clearly distinguishes between individual and collective training. Training institutions working in the area of individual training have been established
(soldier training centres, NCO training and development centres) with the instruction training model and individual abilities standards specifying the requirements to be met for a successful training completion. 

The candidates who volunteer for national military service will be trained in accordance with the individual abilities standards. In addition, the new training system defines the training of the active and passive reserve. 

The new training system is oriented toward meeting interoperability standards, which should enable the Serbian Armed Forces to take part in combined training and exercises and to participate in operations together with the armed forces of other countries. 

In the light of the Draft Decision of the Goverment of the Republic of Serbia by which the compulsory military service is suspended, the issue of allowing voluntary military service arises. In the future, professional soldiers and members of the active reserve will be selected from those volunteers. 

With the appropriate legal solution to this issue that will respect the tradition of our people, a successful continuation of that tradition can be maintained through allowing young people to do their national service as volunteers, which will ensure a high reputation of the Armed Forces in the society, and thus a good quality of the reserve troops. 

Serbian Armed Forces General Staff is a separate organizational

![47_image_0.png](47_image_0.png)

unit of the Ministry of Defence. It is the highest professional and staff organizational part of the defence system, tasked with preparation and use of the Serbian Armed Forces in peace and war, who performs activities in accordance with the law and authorities given by the President of the Republic and the Minister of Defence. The Law on Defence defines the position, purpose and responsibilities of the General Staff of the Republic of Serbia. 

The tradition of the Serbian Armed Forces General Staff is linked with the development of the Serbian state. In 1835, Department of Military Affairs was formed as part of the State Council. In 1876, by a decree on the structure of the general staff, Main General Staff with three branches was established: operational, geographical and historical. In the war, it was reformed to become the Supreme Command. The changes in the country, from the political system and territory to the name, caused changes in the General Staff. The Main General Staff of the Serbian Army changed its name from the Kingdom of Yugoslavia Main General Staff, the Yugoslav Army General Staff, the Armed Forces of SFRY General Staff, Armed Forces of Yugoslavia General Staff, Serbian and Montenegrin Armed Forces General Staff, to the present name –
Serbian Armed Forces General Staff. With transition from the organization based on arms of service and branches to the organization based on

anization of the Serbian Armed Forces General 5
의( different functions in 2005, the Serbian Armed Forces General Staff increased its efficiency and quality of performance of functions and tasks. 

![49_image_0.png](49_image_0.png)

The Serbian Armed Forces General Staff performs the activities related to: development of the Military Doctrine, functional doctrines and other rules for the use of Serbian Armed Forces; creation of the Plan of Use of the Serbian Armed Forces and Mobilization Plan of the Serbian Armed Forces; provision of the guidelines for building the operational and functional capacities of the Serbian Armed Forces; preparation of documents concerning organization of the commands, units and institutions of the Serbian Armed Forces; taking readiness measures based on the documents issued by the President of the Republic or the Minister of Defence; and other tasks regulated by law and documents issued by the president of the Republic and the Minister of Defence. The Serbian Armed Forces General Staff informs and reports to the President of the Republic and the Minister of Defence on its work and conditions in the Serbian Armed Forces. 

The internal organization of the Serbian Armed Forces General Staff is built on the functional principle. The organizational units of the Serbian Armed Forces General Staff are: Cabinet, Joint Operational Command, Departments, and Sections. 

Cabinet of the Chief of the Serbian Armed Forces General Staff is a separate organizational unit which performs studies and analyses; deals with operational, technical and operational issues regarding the Chief of the Serbian Armed Forces General Staff and his deputy; plans, prepares and organizes work and protocol activities of the Chief of the Serbian Armed Forces General Staff. 

Joint Operational Command (JOC) is a novelty in the SAF organization. It originated with the reform changes implying reorganization of the Armed Forces and the General Staff. Although it was not formed long time ago (2007), the Command today possesses capacities, knowledge and experience which enable it to respond adequately to the assigned tasks. 

The Joint Operational Command is the staff body tasked with providing support to the Chief of the Serbian Armed Forces General Staff in operational command of the AF, planning crisis response operations, planning joint operations and commanding forces during execution of joint operations. Joint means integration of components of different arms of service - Air Force and Air Defence and Army, employed with a joint aim and under joint command. 

48

The main characteristic of the Joint Operational Command is a

![50_image_0.png](50_image_0.png)

49
flexible organization, which requires manning of key functions only. Formation of operational planning group and combat command depends on the specific task and the assigned mission, so that in such conditions the strength of Command is subject to changes. JOC also includes: Peace Operations Centre, Defence System Operational Centre and Commission for Military and Technical agreement. 

Formation of the Joint Operational Command has enabled command of the Serbian Armed Forces to be executed by the Chief of the General Staff through the Joint Operational Command and down to the commands of deployed forces being prepared by the commands of arms of service. The arms of service commands functionally command forces of their arms of service. 

Human Resources Department (J-1) is an organizational unit of the Serbian Armed Forces General Staff in charge of integrating tasks and activities falling into the remit of personnel and morale and psychology functions. It is responsible for regulation of the status of the SAF members; monitoring, building and assessment of the morale in the Serbian AF; making proposals for improvement of system and status related issues affecting the morale of the members of the SAF; psychological work in SAF and planning and equipping with movable facilities for cultural and informative activities and organization of religious service in the SAF. 

The First Instance Military Discipline Prosecutors in Belgrade, Nis and Novi Sad, and the First Instance Military Disciplinary Court in Belgrade, Nis and Novi Sad, are directly subordinated to the Human Resources Department (J-1). 

Intelligence and Reconnaissance Department (J-2) is responsible for providing intelligence service to the Serbian Armed Forces. J-2 is the highest body of intelligence service in the Serbian Armed Forces, tasked to prevent surprises and ensure intelligence superiority to unit commanders, through timely provision of intelligence data needed for successful completion of the tasks from all three missions. J-2 is responsible for equipping and development of electric warfare units and intelligence - reconnaissance units of Armed Forces. Electronic Warfare Centre and Military Geographic Institute are directly subordinated to J-2 Operation Department (J-3) continues the tradition of Operation Section of the Serbian Army Main General Staff of the Principality of Serbia and the Kingdom of Serbia (February 2, 1876) and the First Department of the Yugoslav Army General Staff (from March 1945), Yu-

goslav People's Army and the Army of Yugoslavia (until 2001). This indicates that this is one of the General Staff Departments with the longest tradition.

Operation Department (J-3) integrates operational and control functions in order to keep the necessary level of operational and functional abilities and effective leadership and command of the Armed Forces both in peacetime and wartime.

Within the limits of their responsibilities, Operation Department is focused on operational issues, monitoring of situation, control of operational and functional capabilities of commands, units and institutions of the Serbian Armed Forces; regulation of distribution of organizational units of the AF and the Ministry of Defence across the garrisons and garrison sites and safeguarding of installations, movable properties and personnel and creation of plans for preparation and organization of the territory.

Military Police Department - Written records on the history of Serbia date the beginning of the military police back to 1876, when "Police Sections", made up of selected gendarmes and soldiers (in wartime only),
were formed in the brigades of the Serbian Army. In the recent history of Yugoslavia, the date of September 1955 was recorded as the date when the

![53_image_0.png](53_image_0.png)

Military Police was established following the pattern of the western militaries. The Military Police of the Serbian Armed Forces celebrate this date as the Military Police Day. The Military Police developed within the security service until 2004, and later as a separate unit within the Armed Forces. 

The Military Police (MP) of the Serbian Armed Forces act within a defined organizational, functional, legal and normative framework. The Military Police consist of the Military Police Department, Military Police bodies in the commands of the Serbian Armed Forces and formations of the Ministry of Defence, and the units of the Military Police.

The Military Police Department is an organizational unit of the Serbian Armed Forces General Staff. It is tasked with planning, organization, coordination and control of activities related to the military police and some general security issues that concern the Serbian Armed Forces and the Ministry of Defence. These activities in the command of the Serbian Armed Forces and formations of the Ministry of Defence are performed by the bodies of the Military Police being part of the organizational structure of the respective commands and formation.

fence and the Serbian Armed Forces which include crime prevention,

![54_image_1.png](54_image_1.png) control and maintenance of military order and discipline, safeguarding of the most important military facilities, certain persons, documents and weapons, regulation and control of military road traffic and antiterrorist protection.

The members of the Military Police perform specific and more complex tasks in comparison to other members of the Armed Forces, so that staff is recruited on the voluntary basis, through selection of commissioned officers and non-commissioned officers from all branches and services, in accordance with special criteria and through strict selection focused on psychological and physical abilities. The legislation concerning power and authority of the military police toward women have resulted in the higher percentage o women in the Military Police than in any other formation of the Serbian Armed Forces. Since the very beginning, the process of professionalization of the Military Police has been correctly guided and directed so that the Serbian Armed Forces Military Police is fully professionalized. to the job requirements, and is conducted in units, the Military Police

![55_image_0.png](55_image_0.png) Training Centre, as well as at different professional conferences home and abroad. 

The authorized personnel of the Military Police are officers, noncommissioned officers and professional soldiers who, having completed a special course at the Military Police Training Centre and passed professional exam, are assigned to bodies and units of the Military Police.

Following the amendments to the Law on the Serbian Armed Forces, a specialized unit for internal control of the Military Police led by Military Police Inspector was formed. The Inspector's main task is to control legality in cases of use of force by authorized officials in performing military police tasks. The Military Police of the Serbian Armed Forces have various developed forms of international cooperation, especially with similar units from Germany, Denmark, Croatia and Bulgaria. Our interest in this area covers a wide range of issues and experiences important for building of operational and functional capacities of the Serbian Armed Forces Military Police, especially with regard to participation in the peace support operations.

The Military Police units are tasked to carry out executive work.

They are of the battalion level, with different purposes and organizational and formational structures. They are part of the Military Police Department, Army and Guard. The Army comprises 3rd and 5th Military Police Battalions and the Antiterrorist Battalion, which is in terms of organization part of the Special Brigade. 25th Battalion belongs to the Guard, while the Battalion for special purposes "Kobre" and Crime Investigating Group are under the direct command of the Military Police Department. The variety of military police work has led to specialization of lower units, which is visible in the battalion structures (units for general, crime prevention, anti-diversion, traffic and antiterrorist purposes). 

The Battalion for special purposes "Kobre", founded on April 14, 1978, as Antiterrorist Section of 282nd Military Police Battalion, was the first antiterrorist unit in former Yugoslavia's republics and the region. The main task of this unit is to combat various forms of terrorism.

The members of the units today also perform guarding and escorting duties for the officials of the highest state and military importance. 

Guard is a unit of the Serbian Armed Forces which is directly subordinated to the Serbian Armed Forces Chief of the General Staff. It is 54

responsible for protection of persons occupying the highest state and

![56_image_0.png](56_image_0.png) military positions, safeguarding of the facilities of vital importance for defence system, and giving military honours to the top foreign, local, state and military officials. The Guard also performs activities falling into the remit of the Military Police and tasks of providing logistic security for the Ministry of Defence and the Serbian Armed Forces General Staff.

55

company was made up of 73 young men selected from the first group of the Prince's Guard. Eight years later, on May 12, 1838, the foundation of the Guard got the legal framework with the Decree by Prince Milos. For the first time, the Guard assumed the official military character. Since then, that day has been embroidered with a gold thread on the threecoloured strip at the top of the spear of the guard flag. The Guard was reformed and renamed to the King's Guard in 1883. Since then until now the Guard Commander is the adjutant of the head of the state.

The present Guard came into existence through transformation of the Guard Brigade to the Guard on November 30, 2006. 

![57_image_0.png](57_image_0.png)

the descendants in the years to come. As an elite unit, the Guard represents the Serbian Armed Forces and the Republic of Serbia in the best possible way. Being a member of the Guard is seen as an honour and serious obligation. After rigorous selection process, only those with outstanding psychological and physical abilities are admitted to the Guard. 

Central Logistic Base (CLB) is the largest logistic unit in the Serbian Armed Forces. It continues the tradition of 608th Logistics Base, formed on November 16, 1992. This date is marked as the Day of Unit. In terms of structure, CLB is part of the Logistics Department of the SAF General Staff, being its executive unit. 

The base was established on December 15, 2006, through transformation of 608th Rear Base and assignment of storage capacities of 793rd and 534th and 201st Logistics Base. Formation of the Base has made it possible to integrate almost all storage capacities outside troops into one logistic unit. Since it was formed, it has been staffed by professional personnel only. 

56

57

![58_image_0.png](58_image_0.png)

32 locations altogether. The commands of storage battalions are in Gornji Milanovac, Kragujevac, Nis and Belgrade. All battalions are stationed at several locations, which results in many specific features of organization of life and work, commanding and training. 

Reserves outside troops and economic supplies are kept in the Base warehouses. Those reserves and supplies are regularly maintained and replenished through timely issue on consumption and resupply of the used quantities from the market. This guarantees necessary autonomy of the Armed Forces in meeting material needs, as well as certainty and continuity of supply, both in peacetime and wartime. 

In the whole defence system, only the Central Logistic Base has the capacity to perform control and technical inspections, which gives it a crucial role in both preparation and execution of all firing from weapons and artillery pieces of large calibres, carried out by the AF
units. Military capacities for maintenance of power equipment and installations are also located only at the Base, but are used in all locations where such equipment is installed.

Signals Brigade is a unit of the Serbian Armed Forces tasked to es-

![59_image_0.png](59_image_0.png)

tablish and maintain stationary signal system across the whole territory of the Republic of Serbia and mobile components of the signal system at the strategic level for the Ministry of Defence and the Serbian Armed Forces. In the course of reforms on October 30, 2006, the Signals Brigade was formed to incorporate units of 398th Signals Brigade and 235th Stationary Signals Centre. The Brigade Command is in Belgrade, while the subordinated units are located in garrisons and isolated installations across the whole territory of Serbia.

![59_image_1.png](59_image_1.png)

The Day of the Brigade is September 20. On that day in 1916, on the proposal of the Ministry of the Military, Crown Prince Aleksandar Karadjordjevic approved the Directive on military telegraph. By that Directive, signals were separated from engineers and organized as an independent branch of the Army. The Brigade continues the tradition of signal units of the Supreme Command, and the General Staff of Serbian Army, which were formed following the Directive.

Specific features of the Brigade are reflected in the fact that it carries out its most important task, which is to provide and exchange information in MoD and SAF, continuously in the same manner both in peacetime and wartime. In addition, the Brigade accomplishes its tasks on the whole territory of the Republic of Serbia.

The Brigade executes a number of complex tasks in the area of

![60_image_0.png](60_image_0.png)

59
telecommunication and information security and protection of spoken and written information to meet the needs of the Ministry of Defence and the Serbian Armed Forces. In a wide range of numerous duties and tasks, the following can be pointed out: achieving a unique command over the signals system in the Serbian Armed Forces and ensuring continuity of signals within MoD and SAF; protection of all information; integration of the signals system with other telecommunications systems in the country; creation of the signals plans; creation of plans for territorial organization according to the needs of the signals system; training of the Brigade members; building and maintenance of the required levels of operational capabilities; telecommunication support to units of the Serbian Armed Forces during execution of the mission of supporting civilian authorities in combating non-military security threats. Through completion of its tasks the Brigade ensures a high degree of the signal continuity at all levels. 

4.2. ARMY
As part of defence reform of the Serbian Armed Forces, in 2007, the Army was formed and organized following the model of modern armed forces in the world. The Army is the largest armed service of the Serbian Armed Forces whose organization, structure, weapons and equipment are based on the requirements of combat activities on land and within inland waterways. It is being built as a major strength of the Serbian Armed Forces intended to defend the Republic of Serbia from external armed threat and for the conduct of combat and non-combat operations. In addition, it develops capabilities to participate in multinational operations. Therefore, it is a permanent task of the Army to build operational and functional capabilities of commands, units and facilities for the accomplishment of its missions and tasks. The Army is composed of: Army Command located in Niš, Special Brigade, Army Brigades, Mixed Artillery Brigade, River Flotilla, two Military Police Battalions, Signal Battalion, NBC Battalion and Technical Overhaul Institute "Čačak". In the next period, the Army will be optimized in accordance with the requirements arising from the provision of modern armament and military equipment, integration processes and doctrinal solutions.

4 .2.1. SPECIAL BRIGADE
Special Brigade is an elite unit of the Serbian Armed Forces, with

![62_image_0.png](62_image_0.png)

61
a long tradition of having anti-sabotage, counterterrorist, reconnaissance, paratroops and diving units. It was formed on 29th of September

![62_image_1.png](62_image_1.png) 2006, and that day is celebrated as the Unit Day. It was formed by reorganizing and merging 72nd Special Brigade, 63rd Parachute Brigade, parts of 82nd Maritime Centre and Counterterrorist Detachment
"Kobre". The Brigade Command is in Pančevo, and the units are stationed in Niš and Pančevo.

72nd Reconnaissance-Commando Battalion is considered to be a

![63_image_0.png](63_image_0.png)

traditional part of the brigade, the essence and support of all special units, gathering paratroopers, scouts, commandos and divers. Compared to all other units, the battalion has a so-called underwater component consisting of waterways commandos, trained for actions from the air, land and waterways. The members of the battalion are regularly tested, and in addition to various courses, they practice the unit and team tactics on daily basis. 

Counterterrorist Battalion of the Special Brigade conducts offensive and defensive counterterrorist operations in all conditions. Members of this battalion are trained to perform the most complex counterterrorist actions and military police high-risk actions. The members of the Counterterrorist Battalion are fully trained in the resolute resistance of the enemy, capable of performing actions in various situations, equipped with modern weapons and they make the backbone of effective response in case of terrorist threats. The release of hostages, securing VIPs, important buildings and institutions are part of their numerous obligations in the field of prevention. 

In the process of reorganizing of the Serbian Armed Forces, a Parachute Battalion was formed within the structure of the Special Brigade, which, since the very beginning, has been fully professionalized. All that was done on the development of parachuting in Serbia has been preserved in *63rd Parachute Battalion.* The unit lives and works at the Nis Military Airfield and achieves excellent results in parachute training and quality instructor staff, as well as perfect training infrastructure. The members of this battalion are trained on a daily basis, and at least two months a year they spend on field exercises. *Search and Rescue Parachute Company* is the only professional unit in the Republic of Serbia for combat search and rescue, also designed to operate behind the enemy lines, in order to rescue downed pilots, prisoners, and for the execution of combat in urban areas. The unit can also provide assistance to civilian structures in the event of natural disasters and catastrophes. Training for such tasks is complex and characterized by high level of psychological and physical stress, risk and adapting to the real situation.

The largest number of officers and soldiers of the unit has the capability to perform free action jumps. 

Effective work in a special unit includes superior physical fitness of the individual, which is a prerequisite for quality tactical and fire exercise in teams and units. In addition to highly qualified members, mod62

![64_image_0.png](64_image_0.png)

ern and effective combat means, weapons and equipment, the special brigade units are also characterized by specific requirements in training that make them different from conventional army.

Complex, efficient and continuous training, full of controlled risk is a way of life of the Special Brigade members. Contemporary training is tailored according to today's challenges, and requires constant upgrading of sites and facilities for practicing Special Forces tactics. Constant improving the quality of training and finding many different modalities, special tactics and operations on the ground allows for successful execution of the tasks, protection of people and technology and effective return after the end of activity.

![75_image_0.png](75_image_0.png)

basic organizational structure consists of modular unit of AD battalion level. 250th Air Defence Missile Brigade Command is located in the barracks "Banjica", while the units are deployed in nine locations. 

The first unit armed with the air defence rocket system (SА-75
"Dvina") in the former Yugoslavia was 250th Air Defence Missile Regiment. Missile regiment was formed on November 24th 1962, with the task to defend Belgrade and its surrounding area. In memory of creation of the first rocket unit, this date is taken as the Day of 250th Air Defence Missile Brigade. By introducing the rocket system S-125 "Neva" into use and the formation of new battalions in 1980, the unit became brigade-level. The Brigade was awarded the Order of National Hero –
the highest war recognition, in honour of all victims and for its contribution to the national defence against the NATO aggression in 1999, and in 2004, a "Gramata" from Patriarch Pavle. In 2004, the personnel and technical means of the dissolved 450th Air Defence Missile Regiment from Kraljevo entered the brigade composition.

As part of the defence reform, on April 26th 2007, the brigade was reorganized and then, in addition to the existing units armed with the rocket system S-125 "Neva", it also included the units armed with the system 2К12М "'Kub-М" from Niš, Novi Sad and Kragujevac, and two years earlier integrated parts of the dissolved 60th Air Defence SelfPropelled Missile Regiment from Danilovgrad also integrated into its structure. Inheriting the tradition of all air defence rocket units, the brigade keeps the memory of twenty-eight members killed in defence of the country in 1999. 

250th Air Defence Missile Brigade is intended for the air defence of the wider regions of towns and units of the Serbian Armed Forces against hostile reconnaissance and the enemy air attacks. It is trained to perform combat tasks independently and jointly with other air defence units (fighter aviation and early warning units).

In addition to its Command, 250th Air Defence Missile Brigade also includes the following units: Command Battery, 1st Air Defence Rocket Battalion in Zuce, 2nd Air Defence Rocket Battalion in Jakovo, 230th Air Defence Self-Propelled Rocket Battalion in Niš, 240th Air Defence Self-Propelled Rocket Battalion in Novi Sad and 310th Air Defence Self-Propelled Rocket Battalion in Kragujevac.

![76_image_1.png](76_image_1.png) defence command system and to create conditions for the use of the air defence units, as well as to provide other structures with the information for the antiaircraft combat and antiaircraft protection. 

After disintegration of SFRY, on October 12th 1992, from the existing three early warning regiments, 126th Early Warning Brigade was formed. During combat operations in 1999, for all the period of 78 days, the unit successfully performed its assigned task. For exceptional courage and the results achieved in the defence of the country during combat operations in 1999, the unit was awarded the Order of National Hero. 

126th Early Warning Centre celebrates June 18 as its day. On that day in 1915, the Serbian Supreme Command issued the Order to establish permanent observation signal posts, to mark the direction of flight of the enemy aircraft. Based on this, within the Third Army several stations were established in the areas covered by Drina, Timok and Mixed divisions. 

The unit's area of responsibility is the complete air space over the Republic of Serbia. The unit distributes data on the situation in the air space to all the users in the defence system. The unit is specific for a large number of small separated combat structures and the cooperation with the Air Traffic Control Agency. The Centre Command is located in Belgrade. 

It is equipped with Western and Russian weapons. Radar-computer devices and the systems 126th Early Warning Centre is equipped

(S-613) and automatic systems (AS-74 and АS-84). 

In addition to 126th Early Warning Centre Command, the units includes: Command Company, 20th Early Warning Battalion, 31st Early Warning Battalion and the Centre for Aircraft-technical and Technical Maintenance and Supply.

4.3 .4 . INDEPENDENT BATTALIONS
Two independent battalions, 333rd Engineer Battalion and 210th Signal Battalion are within the structure of the Air Force and Air Defence. 

333rd Engineer Battalion was formed in March 1947, at the airport Cerklje (today in Slovenia), although Pančevo was previously designated as its garrison. Immediately after formation, the unit was relocated to Tuzla garrison, where it was stationed until 1955. The first important task assigned to the unit was "Construction of grass runway" as a part of the first exercise of the Yugoslav Army, in the area of Knić. In 1968, the battalion moved to Pančevo garrison, where it has been located ever since. In its history, 333rd Engineer Battalion participated in the construction of almost all military airfields. At the beginning, it mostly constructed grass runways (RWY) and runways with concrete covering.

Since 1990, the battalion has been engaged both on the construction of infrastructure for the needs of rocket and radar units within the territorial air defence system and the construction of roads, repair of grass runways and ski slopes, building infrastructure of the defence industry –
Corporation "Trajal" in Kruševac, as well as on other services for the clients outside the Serbian Armed Forces. With the disbandment of 359th Engineer Battalion from Ladjevci in 2005, only one independent engineer battalion remained in the Air Force and Air Defence. 

333rd Engineer Battalion is designed, equipped and able to make, repair and maintain the manoeuvring areas at airfields and to perform other engineer operations for the needs of the air force and air defence commands and units as a whole. The battalion's area of responsibility is the entire territory of the Republic of Serbia. 

76

As part of its purpose, the battalion performs the following tasks:

![78_image_0.png](78_image_0.png)

basic and additional setting up of obstacles; overcoming natural and artificial obstacles; repairs, maintenance and construction of communications in the defence areas and the directions of attack of the units for whose needs it is engaged (including the most important task of removing damage on the airfield operational areas, caused by modern ordnance); fortification and construction of facilities for fire action and protection at command posts, communication centres, missile and radar sites, airfields, etc.; assistance to civilian structures in eliminating the consequences of natural disasters. 

The battalion comprises Command, 2 engineering companies, fortification companies, logistics platoon and the signal section. The battalion is equipped with basic infantry weapons, ordnance, engineering machines, engineering means and motor vehicles. 

210th Signal Battalion is the basic tactical unit of telecommunication service, equipped and trained for establishing communications for the needs of superior command. It is deployed in the area of Belgrade and Novi Sad. 210th Signal Battalion Command is in Belgrade. 

210th Signal Battalion is intended to serve the elements of stationary communications centre of the Air Force and Air Defence Command, set up mobile communications centre and provides telecommunications and information support for the needs of the Air Force and Air Defence Command in peace, state of war and emergency. 

The task of 210th Signal Battalion is: ensuring continuity and quality operation of telecommunications and information system and protection of information for the needs of the Air Force and Air Defence Command; steady reinforcement of the elements of the stationary communications centre; setting up mobile communications centre at the Air Force and Air Defence command post and training of personnel to work on telecommunications and information devices and systems. The composition of 210th Signal Battalion includes: Command, two signal companies, two signal platoons and a logistics platoon.

Equipment and weapons of 210th Signal Battalion meet the current requirements of command, it is still in operation, but the communications means were produced in the seventies and eighties of the last century and they are partially compatible with modern communications systems of the latest generation, which were introduced during 2009 and 2010., and which will be introduced into the weapons and equip-

![79_image_0.png](79_image_0.png)

ment of the battalion. These are telephone-telegraph equipment, radio and radio-relay devices that are still in use, and in the future they will be replaced with the new generation devices. 210th Signal Battalion is equipped with both stationary and mobile devices, of domestic and

Institute of Aviation Medicine 79
Within the Air Force and Air Defence, the Institute of Aviation

![80_image_0.png](80_image_0.png)

![80_image_1.png](80_image_1.png)

Medicine occupies an important place, a specialized health and educational institution, responsible for the development of aviation medicine in all its aspects, training of personnel in the field of aviation medicine, medical selection of military and civil pilots and parachutists and organization and implementation of specific measures of preventive medical care, primary and secondary health care in the Air Force units of the Serbian Armed Forces. 

As part of the Air Force Command, in spring 1945, the first Air Force ambulance service was formed, and on November 11th in Zemun, the Aviation-Medical Institute was formed. The sudden development of aviation caused that in 1947 the Institute received the form of a scientific institution, since it started with the research in the field of aviation medicine. 

During combat operations in 1999, the Batajnica airport was repeatedly bombed. In one of these bombings, the building of the Institute was damaged, which required the relocation of the Institute. It was moved to the MMA, reorganized and its name was changed into the Institute of Aviation Medicine.

4. 4. TRAINING COMMAND
The Training Command is the operational structure of the Serbian Armed Forces in peace intended for individual training of soldiers doing their voluntary military service, candidates for professional soldiers and members of active reserve; training of candidates for non-commissioned officers; specialized training of personnel and collective training of territorial units. 

It was formed on April 23rd 2007, from parts of the Operational Forces, Army and Air Force and Air Defence units. By this, integration of territorial centres for basic training and professional and specialized training of different branches and services was made. In addition to the training centres, within the Training Command, there are also training fields and grounds. The Training Command is located in Belgrade.

In peace, the Training Command includes: Command, Command Battalion, Centres for individual training, the Army, Air Force and Air Defence, Logistics, Signal and IT Training Centres, NBC Training Centre,

![81_image_1.png](81_image_1.png)

81
NCO Training and Development Centre, Combined-Arms Training

![82_image_0.png](82_image_0.png)

Ground "Pasuljanske livade" and Command for development of territorial brigades. 

In war, officers of the Training Command form the core of the war units of the Serbian Armed Forces - territorial brigades, which are manned with reservists. Training centres form territorial brigades. 

The Training Command performs individual training of soldiers doing their voluntary military service, candidates for professional soldiers and members of active and passive reserve and training of candidates for non-commissioned officers. 

In the process of training, soldiers first complete their basic and then specialized training, depending on the branch, service and specialty. After that, by the end of the military service, the brigade organizes joint training at the level of sections, platoons and companies, as in the tactical units, already trained soldiers come for basic military duties. Training at the tactical level include: individual training, training of the services, crews, teams, training of commands and collective training of the units. 

Commands of the armed services are responsible for preparing their units for use and management of the system of collective training and for the training of subordinate units and commands. 

Training at the tactical level is carried out by: commands and units at tactical level, centres for basic and specialized training, NCO Training and Development Centre, Centre for Peace Operations, Simulation Centre and Combined-Arms training ground. 

In the training centres, general military training and specialized military training is organized and performed for the members of the Serbian Armed Forces, from soldiers to officers, as well as the members of other defence forces, and there is a possibility of training of foreign armies. 

4 .4.1. BASIC TRAINING CENTRES 
Basic Training Centres are intended to perform basic individual training according to uniform training program and standards of the basic training of soldiers and they are located in Sombor, Valjevo and Leskovac. 

Training of soldiers begins in the basic training centers of the Command. Due to the uniform training curricula, but also the training that is carried out according to the same criteria, soldiers have equal opportu-

![83_image_0.png](83_image_0.png)

nities to acquire the necessary knowledge and skills, regardless of the military specialty they have been recruited for.

![83_image_1.png](83_image_1.png)

During their stay in the training centres, officers and psychologists evaluate the psychological profile of conscripts and monitor their adjustment to new living conditions. Based on the assessment, they select candidates for specific duties and prepare soldiers for difficult tasks. Daily consultations contribute to creating favourable interpersonal relationships in units and motivation of soldiers, which reduces the possibility of adverse extraordinary events.

## 4.4.2. Specialist Training Centres

Specialist Training Centres, for the Army soldiers in Požarevac, the Air Force and Air Defence soldiers in Batajnica, for training and development of the soldiers belonging to signals, IT and electronic units in Gornji Milanovac, and for those belonging to logistics and NBC units in Kruševac, are designed for specialist training and development of the personnel belonging to different branches and services. Logistics Training Centre has the units in Kraljevo - for training soldiers in transporta-

83
tion service, and in Niš - for training soldiers in veterinary and medical

![84_image_0.png](84_image_0.png)

![84_image_1.png](84_image_1.png) service. 

Training in specialist training centres follows basic training, depending on the branch, service and specialty. Such a model ensures that the training command evaluates and controls the training process more accurately and successfully, but also affects its quality. 

NCO Training Centre is designed to train candidates for non-commissioned officers and provide development of NCO personnel. It is located in Pančevo. 

Combined-Arms training ground Pasuljanske livade is intended for military training exercises and shooting exercises using the weapons it is equipped with.

After establishment of the professional armed forces, the centres for basic and specialized training will train candidates for professional soldiers, members of passive and active reserve, soldiers doing their voluntary military service and non-commissioned officers. 

In the future, organizational-formation structure of the Training Command will be adjusted and optimized in line with trends of signing up volunteers for doing the military service and the needs of the Serbian Armed Forces for training other categories of staff.

In carrying out preparation for defence, despite the undisputed

![88_image_0.png](88_image_0.png)

5.1 . PERSONNEL MANAGEMENT
87
# Role Of Technological Factors In This Area, The Human Factor Remains The Most Important Resource Of Defence System Of The Republic Of Serbia.

Bearing in mind the prior importance of human resources for defence, the Ministry of Defence has been made continuous efforts to develop such human resources management system that enables efficient selection of personnel, monitoring and career development, proper structure per age and ranks, developing of human resources structure in accordance with projected missions and tasks and training of personnel to continue their career outside the Armed Forces. 

Also, measures are taken to make the work in the military sector attractive to qualified personnel, primarily through legislative reform, education system and personnel training, significant improvement of the living standards of the members of the Armed Forces, objective evaluation of work results and career development in line with that. 

After the Law on Defence and the Law on Serbian Armed Forces were adopted and entered into force the conditions have been created for improving the functioning of the defence system as a whole, as well as the sub-system of human resources management. The adoption of a number of decrees, regulations and decisions, improved the financial status and standard of employees, enabling greater interest in working in the MoD and the Serbian Armed Forces. 

By undertaking a series of steps to reduce the number of persons in the defence system and to achieve the required structure of personnel in accordance with needs, a relatively favourable environment has been created based on which medium and long-term planning of human resources can begin, based on modern scientific principles. 

The basic vision of human resources management in the defence system is the creation and implementation of sustainable policies, based on realistic resources and tailored to the needs of the defence system. Implementation of such policies will provide meeting the needs of the defence system for qualified personnel, who by the accomplishment of the tasks within the defence system also accomplish their personal goals.

![89_image_0.png](89_image_0.png) In other words, implementation of the principle "the right man at the right place" can be achieved not only by proper selection, management and continuous improvement of personnel, but also by appropriate support to each employee in the defence system. 

Human resources management system that is currently developed in the MoD and SAF is aimed at achieving the objectives of equal opportunities, predictable career, providing support to families of professional members in their daily lives and preparation of professional members of the MoD and SAF for civilian life, after the termination of professional service. Ministry of Defence has developed **Personnel Management Program** that defines long-term development trends in the area of human resources. In accordance with orientation to professionalism, this program gives the frames of "predictable career" as a function of quality personnel management. Ratings for all employees in the defence system according to accepted Criteria for Professional Soldiers Ranking were carried out, and provided a clear definition and delineation of promising from non-promising personnel. 

Professional members of the Serbian Armed Forces and the Ministry of Defence of the Republic of Serbia are professional military personnel and civilians serving in the Serbian Armed Forces. Professional military personnel are officers, non-commissioned officers and professional soldiers. Civilians are military servants and military appointees. 

Of the total number of professional members of MoD and SAF,
19.23% are officers, 22.78% are non-commissioned officers, 22.98% are contract soldiers and 35.03% are civilians. In the structure of the Serbian Armed Forces, the staff categories are as follows: officers 18.81%, non-commissioned officers 29.43%, professional soldiers 34.19% and civilians 17.56%, which is approximate to the general structure of personnel of the Serbian Armed Forces for 2010, defined in the Strategic Defence Review (15% officers, 25% non-commissioned officers, 45% soldiers and 15% civilians).

The structure of the ranking officers in the defence system is as follows: second lieutenants 6.76%, 15.4% of lieutenants, 22.81% of captains, 23.99% of majors, 21.87% of lieutenant colonels, 8.55% of colonels and 0.59% of generals. It is important to emphasize that the percentage of junior officers (second lieutenant - captain) was raised to 44.97%, which is an increase of 5.97% compared to 2007. 

The Ministry of Defence and the Serbian Armed Forces is represented by 6,142 women: 29 officers, 29 NCOs, 531 professional soldiers 88

Reserve service is regulated by the Law on Conscription, Labour and Material Obligations, which was adopted in 2009. Reserve units include: **reserve component of the Serbian Armed Forces;** reserve component of civil defence and other defence forces; non-assigned conscripts.

Reserve forces of the Serbian Armed Forces are divided into active reserve and passive reserve. Active reserve is a trained reserve force of the Serbian Armed Forces, included to man the units of the Serbian Armed Forces and the Ministry of Defence, in order to carry out tasks in the certain period of time. A member of active reserve may be a conscript younger than 60, who meets general and specific requirements set by the competition, related to military qualifications, medical - psychological and physical ability to be placed in a certain position for which the contract is signed. Members of active reserve man commands, units and institutions of the Serbian Armed Forces, which are designated as having a higher degree of operational and functional capability. 

Passive reserve include members of the reserve force, who have wartime posting in the commands, units and institutions in the Serbian Armed Forces, the Ministry of Defence, government agencies, civil de5 .2. EDUCATION AND TRAINING
The tradition of military education in Serbia, 160 years long, is closely associated with the process of creation of modern Serbian state and its military in 19th century. The wars of the Serbian people for liberation from Ottoman rule allowed the restoration of the Serbian state, and one of its cornerstones was the military itself. It set out on its back the main burden of the wars, at the same time it created and developed itself, and in a renovated country actively participated in building its institutions. 

The modern system of military education of the Republic of Serbia, as part of the educational and scientific system of the Republic of Serbia, organizes and implements the process of personnel education in the areas of interest to defence and other areas of importance for achieving the required abilities of the defence system members in accordance with the scope and responsibilities of the Ministry of Defence and tasks of the Serbian Armed Forces.

![91_image_0.png](91_image_0.png)

The system of military education of the Republic of Serbia

![92_image_0.png](92_image_0.png)

91
successfully provides the projected needs of the defence system of the Republic of Serbia for the personnel of appropriate profile. It is an effective and rational system in compliance with standards and principles of education of professional military personnel as in the program Partnership for Peace participating countries and the requirements of a common European Higher Education Area and standards and principles of the Bologna process. 

The main source of manning the officer corps is education at the Military Academy, and since the school year 2009/10, at the Military Medical Academy (MMA), as well, when MMA High School started to work. The Military Academy and the Military Medical Academy have completed the accreditation process as high schools of academic studies and they accredited study programs, and the process of accreditation of integrated University of Defence and study programs for the third level of education
(PhD) is underway. The next stage of reform of higher military education includes the establishment of a military university. 

Intensive preparations for the establishment of the University of Defence, which will include activities of the Military Academy and a part of the Military Medical Academy, began in 2009. At this University, academic studies at all levels are planned to be organized (elementary, undergraduate, integrated, specialist and doctoral)
in the three scientific areas: socio-humanistic, technical and technological (Military Academy) and the field of Medical Sciences (Faculty of Medicine of the Military Medical Academy). In addition, within this higher education institution, complete educational and scientific research activities would be merged, as a unique process of higher education for operational needs of MoD and SAF. 

Additional source of manning the officer corps is education in civilian institutions of higher education, with additional training to perform certain duties in the Ministry and the Armed Forces. 

Non-commissioned officers are trained in the training centres through implementing the new concept of training and professional development. Candidates for the Basic NCO course are professional soldiers in the rank of corporal, who have completed

![93_image_0.png](93_image_0.png) basic training for leaders, or civilians who apply for NCO training. 

Members of MoD and SAF are also sent to the prestigious military higher education institutions abroad for education and training, and a growing number of those belonging to foreign armed forces are educated and trained in the system of military education of the Republic of Serbia, at all levels. 

In accordance with the provisions of the Convention on Human Rights and Gender Equality and the experience of most European countries, since the school year 2007/08, the Military Academy provides education for females, and since the beginning of the work of MMA High School, women have been equally eligible for admission and training at this military educational institution. 

By accepting international standards of learning and testing knowledge of foreign languages and information technologies in the defence system, interoperability of the MoD and SAF personnel with the armed forces of European countries has been increased, which is of vital importance to the equal participation of MoD and SAF personnel in a multinational environment.

Military Academy In January 1850, Ilija Garašanin forwarded to the State Council a project proposal on the transformation of the Foundry into the officer's school, and a proposal for the establishment of the Artillery School. The State Council has adopted this proposal, and by a Decree on the Establishment, Prince Alexander Karadjordjević approved its establishment from 1850. Hence, today, March 18th is celebrated as the Day of the Military Academy and Military Education. 

Over 160 years of its history, the Military Academy has worked in various conditions and historical circumstances, adjusting to them and continuously changing, in constant effort to be modern, efficient and functional educational institution. At the beginning of the third millennium, the Serbian military education has met another challenge of fundamental reforms, that have been implemented in this field since 2006, and are aimed at profiling a modern, efficient and educational system, which will fully meet the needs and tasks of SAF, to coordinate and harmonize civilian and military education in the country and eventually promote insti92

93
tutional framework, which will round up the process of educational and

![94_image_0.png](94_image_0.png)

![94_image_1.png](94_image_1.png) scientific activities in the defence and security field in Serbia. 

Training at the Military Academy is designed as an integrated system of academic programs, military training and professional development of the officer staff at all levels and in all areas. In addition to training personnel for the needs of the defence system of the Republic of Serbia, the Military Academy also educates members of the armed forces of other countries. 

Basic, professional education of officers consists of four-year undergraduate studies, combined with military training, which provides the profile of future officers, which meets the needs of the defence system. Upon completion of undergraduate studies, cadets are trained for initial officer's duties the level of a platoon commander in accordance with the missions and tasks of the Serbian Armed Forces. Five academic programs are carried out at the Military Academy: Management in Defence, Military Mechanical Engineering, Military Electronic Engineering, Military Chemical Engineering and Military Aviation.

Graduate academic studies provide broadening the knowledge acquired in undergraduate studies and the acquisition of competence for senior posts in his/her branch-service the level of company-battery commander, as well as for doing the job of a graduate manager or engineer of a certain profile. These studies are carried out in four study programs, including: Management in Defence, Military Mechanical Engineering, ![95_image_0.png](95_image_0.png) and is also conducted in the camps. Camps are organized at the camp facilities and the training centres and are of different duration. 

Professional development throughout the military career is an important part of educational activities at the Military Academy. This concept includes four levels of training: Basic Command Staff Course, Command Staff Course, General Staff Course and Higher Studies in Security and Defence. 

Basic Command Staff Course prepares officers for duties the level of a company commander and functional duties in battalion-level commands of a branch type. It is attended by officers the ranks of lieutenant and captain and lasts for three months. 

At the Command Staff Course, officers are trained to command battalion-level tactical units, perform staff duties at brigade-level commands and other duties in higher commands of the Armed Forces and organizational nits of the MoD (per type of career). Candidates are officers the ranks of captain and major. It lasts for one school year or 10 months. 

94

95
General Staff Course is intended to prepare officers to command

brigade-level units (formations), to perform staff, teaching and other duties in commands and organizational units of the Armed Forces and the MoD at operational and strategic levels (of combined-arms character).

It is attended by officers the ranks of major and lieutenant colonel. It lasts for one school year or 9 months. 

It is planned that the fourth level of professional development, Higher Studies in Security and Defence, comes into life with the implementation of the next phase of reform of higher military education. The aim of this training is to prepare officers for the highest duties in the MoD and SAF, civil servants and other persons for the high posts in the ministries, state agencies and institutions of the Republic of Serbia that are engaged in security and defence matters. 

Training for reserve officers is also carried out at the Military Academy. The aim of this training is to train reserve officers to perform duties of section and platoon commanders and other duties of that level in a certain branch-service, in accordance with the missions and tasks of the Serbian Armed Forces.

Military Medical Academy (MMA)
Military medical Academy tradition goes back to the first half of 19th century when, by a Decree of Prince Alexander Karadjordjević, on March 2nd 1844, "the first Central Military Hospital" was founded. The date is now celebrated as the Day of MMA. The new building was built in 1909, which made it the most modern medical institution in the Balkans with 400 hospital beds. Six doctors from the military hospital were involved in the formation of the Medical Faculty in Belgrade. The hospital was renamed into the main Military Hospital of the Kingdom of Yugoslavia, and in 1950, it got the name of the Military Medical Academy. Ever since, MMA has been a leading military and medical, scientific and research institution and a centre for postgraduate education in the country. Generations of top medical professionals have incorporated their knowledge, effort and enthusiasm into the development of MMA so that today it is one of the most respected institutions in the region. 

Military medical Academy is a health, educational and scientific institution in the Ministry of Defence, which since 2007, with 40% of capacity, has also been integrated into the public health system of the Republic of Serbia. MMA system is organized in 27 clinics, 17 institutes, diagnostic and outpatient Centre with well-equipped Centre for day sur-

![97_image_0.png](97_image_0.png) activities. Division of Preventive Medicine has a special importance from the military and general-social point of view. All this is supported by the Department of Logistics, which takes care of all material and technical aspects of MMA functioning. MMA Institute of Pharmacy provides medical supply of medicines, reagents, diagnostics, but it is also a small factory of medicines and other products. 

Military medical Academy has nearly 3,000 employees, of which 470 physicians, 40 dentists, 1,400 nurses, 36 pharmacists, a large number of molecular biologists and other experts. MMA is a highly specialized tertiary medical centre where modern diagnostic (multi-slice scanner and magnetic resonance imaging) and therapeutic procedures
(neuro-radiological, endoscopic, cardiology and gastroenterology, endovascular techniques, performing complicated surgeries and treatment of all internist diseases) are applied. 

Military medical Academy is a leading institution in the region to perform transplantation of solid organs (liver, kidney) and stem cells, because it was recognized by the relevant international professional insti96

![98_image_0.png](98_image_0.png)

![98_image_1.png](98_image_1.png)

accordance with the highest standards of quality management, environmental protection, health and safety at work, and laboratory work –
ISO 9001, 14001, 18001, 22000 and 17025. 

Military medical Academy members participate in multinational operations with prior joint training with colleagues from the countries that are our strategic partners, such as members of the Health Service of the Kingdom of Norway. To date, a number of MMA participated in UN missions in Congo, and since June 23 2009, they have also participated in the work of medical teams of the Serbian Armed Forces who are engaged in UN peacekeeping mission in Chad and Central African Republic. For demonstrated humanity, courage, professionalism and commitment in carrying out these duties, they have received much praise and recognition of domestic and international institutions. 

A number of top-level military-medical and state-political delegations visits this institution daily. Topics of interest relate to the unique experience of MMA experts in the field of war surgery, care of the wounded and sick in conditions of mass disasters, post-traumatic stress syndrome. 

Military medical Academy has a significant role in the Balkans and the World Committee of Military Medicine, and the institution was named the regional centre for military medical cooperation. In addition,

![99_image_0.png](99_image_0.png) more than 50 young professionals were sent to the world's most eminent training centres, from Houston to Tokyo. 

Military and civilian medical personnel of all profiles are educated at the Military Medical Academy, and 120 professors and assistant professors, 237 PhDs and 97 MSs are involved in teaching. The Department for Education and Scientific Research is responsible for educational and research process, as well as publishing activities. Medical School of Reserve Officers, professional courses for medical technicians, numerous courses, seminars and other forms of teaching are a sort of tradition at MMA. 

Special recognition and popularity of MMA has been gained through the conduct of military medical training exercises of both the members of the Medical School of Reserve Officers and international ones, aimed at raising the combat readiness and technical readiness of the members of the medical service in case of war and mass disasters and catastrophes. One result of these activities is MMA membership in the Balkan Military Medical Committee. 

With the establishment of the Higher School of Integrated Medical Studies, the prerequisites for the training of military physicians have been created. This year, MMA School of Medicine has become an integral part of the newly formed Serbian University of Defence. In the first half of 2010, MMA Centre for Continuous Medical Education accredited within the Health Council of Serbia more than 250 professional meetings, courses, seminars and symposiums designed to educate medical staff of all profiles from both the MoD and civilian structures. At any time, more than 250 people are educated at MMA. 

The MMA development strategy in the future lies in maintaining its role as a leading health, education and scientific research institution in the MoD and the Republic of Serbia.

Military High School Since its establishment in 1970, the Military High School has been an elite educational institution, not only by the extraordinary success achieved in the education of many generations of future military leaders, but also by inevitable care and educational role which the school has never neglected. That role has remained at the behest ever since it was called King Alexander Gymnasium. Over 6,000 pupils graduated from the Military High School, some of whom have achieved the highest command and leading duties in the defence system of the Republic of Serbia and the countries in the region.

psychological and physical abilities and raising the motivation for the military profession. The Military High School pupils acquire general education to continue their education at the Military Academy. The curriculum is aligned with the curriculum of the general-type high school in the system of secondary education in the Republic of Serbia. In addition to acquiring general knowledge necessary for further education at the Military Academy, constant attention is paid to maintaining the motivation threshold of pupils for the military profession.

Specific identity of the Military High School and the popularity among potential candidates for admission are the results of not only financial security and some prospects for future career that it brings, but also the quality of teaching and tradition of this school, as well as a variety of sports and cultural activities, extra-curricular activities that take place in the school. Particular forms of work have had a particular motivational effect on the young population. During the four-year education, the pupils are trained in swimming and skiing, and in accordance with the curriculum, tours and visits to historical sites in the country and the region are arranged. 

Military High School is a unique and recognizable in the country for its success in teaching, sports competitions, and especially as an environment free of violence, alcohol and drugs.

5.3 . TRAINING
Training in the Serbian Armed Forces is a planned and organized process of acquiring knowledge, skills, habits, and developing psychophysical and intellectual abilities and moral qualities of personality, by which the individuals, units, commands and organizational units of the SAF General Staff are trained to perform individual and collective tasks in a safe manner, in peace, state of war and emergency. 

The training objective is to achieve the determined standards of individual and collective training of individuals, units and institutions, building capacity to carry out assigned missions and tasks. 

By type of those being trained, training can be: individual training, training of crews and teams, collective training and training of commands.

According to the content, **individual training** can be: basic, specialist and functional. The objective of individual training is to create 100

![102_image_0.png](102_image_0.png)

![102_image_1.png](102_image_1.png) gaining skills, actions and procedures to work in the crew and team and achieving efficiency which cannot be achieved by the individual. 

Collective training is the type of training in which the units are trained, as a whole, to carry out the assigned missions and tasks, independently or jointly with the units of other branches and services. Collective training involves training of two or more crews and teams, and training of commands to perform tactical operations. Forms of collective training are training of branches, services and specialties, combinedarms training and combined-service training. These forms of training can be carried out within national and multinational forces and as training for a specific mission.

cludes all levels of command. It must be maximally adapted to the requirements of the use of units and the spirit of relations prevailing in the

![103_image_0.png](103_image_0.png)

operation chain of command. The command structure training should develop the ability for teamwork, initiative, self-confidence, responsibility and expertise. 

Tactical level of training includes training of commands, collective training of units the level of section to brigade, training of crews and teams and individual training. Training institutions at the tactical level are tactical commands and units, centres for basic and specialized training, NCO training centre, centre for peacekeeping operations, simulation training centre, centres for collective training and combined-arms training ground. 

The Serbian Armed Forces will apply a new model of training professional units, which will bring to an end conscript training. The new model of professional military training will require the establishment and development of the model of training the soldiers on voluntary military service, the formation and establishment of active reserve, training of the reserve component and war units and the creation of conditions to start training of newly established commands for the development of forces for support. 

Achieving interoperability with foreign partners will enable the Serbian Armed Forces the use of common procedures and actions in training, exercises and operations. Adoption of standards as the basic means of achieving interoperability will ensure the SAF compatibility and interchangeability with the NATO and other partner countries. 

Increased involvement of the MoD and SAF members in the program Partnership for Peace and increased participation of the SAF contingents in multinational operations within the PfP nominal strength will create the conditions for carrying out joint training exercises with the forces of partner countries and the use of modern standards, as well as placing new demands on personnel training for the implementation of tasks in an international environment.

The most important material resources for defence purposes are funds, weapons and military equipment, military infrastructure and capacities for production of weapons and military equipment. Policy of planning material resources for defence purposes is carried out with respect to the principle of reality and transparency in accounting and expenditure of the funds approved. Implementation of the process of material resource management also covers the programs that contribute to strengthening the interoperability with the armed forces of the NATO and Partnership for Peace member states.

6. 1. LOGISTIC SUPPORT OF THE SERBIAN ARMED FORCES 
Logistics in the Serbian Armed Forces is a special subsystem of military organization in which its primary mission defined as logistic support in carrying out missions and tasks of the Armed Forces in all conditions and forms of its use is accomplished by coordinated relationship,

## Organization And Use Of Logistic Capacity,.

The sources of logistic support are production, material reserves, overhaul, repair and regeneration, import, traffic, transport and health care resources and infrastructure of the Republic of Serbia. 

The principles underlying the logistics of the Serbian Armed Forces are integrity, territoriality, system openness, flexibility, continuity, integrity and mobility, in order to provide efficient and cost-effective logistic support. 

The aim of applying the basic principles is establishing a functioning logistic structure and its connecting and relying on appropriate national and economic capacities, which according to the actual capacities provide support to the Armed Forces in the accomplishment of its goals and objectives in the optimal way. 

Logistic organization is built on a functional basis. The logistic bodies are the backbone of logistic organization, including command, administrative and executive bodies, which are built into the military organizational structure according to the command levels. Executive Aircraft Overhaul Facility Moma Stanojlović With the formation of Aircraft Squadron on Corfu in 1916, the first Serbia Aircraft workshop was formed, which historically has repeatedly changed its base and name. After the break was made in its work, it was put into operation again in 1944, after the Second World War. An Aircraft Technical Overhaul Facility Jastreb was formed, which overhauls aircraft and aircraft equipment, and in 1952, the Aircraft Technical Overhaul Facility Moma Stanojlović was formed, which overhauls aircraft engines. By merging those two facilities, the Aircraft Overhaul Facility Moma Stanojlović was formed, which was successfully operating under that name since 1976, as far as 1999, when due to NATO intervention, its business slowed down and great material damage was inflicted. In the past 11 years, the Facility has managed to restore most of its facilities and to continue working. It is now working on restoring infrastructure, integration and modernization. Except for the Serbian

![109_image_0.png](109_image_0.png)

Institute Kragujevac continues the tradition of Laboratorijum facility, which operated within the Foundry. The Foundry was founded in Belgrade in 1848, and then relocated to Kragujevac, and later became the Military Technical Facility, the largest military factory in the Balkans (destroyed during the Second World War). In the years after the Second World War, the Military Technical Institute in Kragujevac was restored, and already in 1944, the pyrotechnics activities. The Institute was damaged again during the 1999 combat operations. 

The Technical Overhaul Institute Kragujevac was designed and built specifically for the maintenance of all types and calibres of ammunition and explosive ordnance - ordnance from the jurisdiction of the Army: small arms ammunition, mortar mines and bazookas mines, hand grenades, ammunition for recoilless weapons, artillery ammunition used by ground and antiaircraft artillery, tank ammunition, antipersonnel and antitank mines, trotyl bullets and ammunition for secondary purposes (test, school, drill, etc.). 

Quality standard YUS ISO 9001:2001 and CHO 9010:2005 was introduced in 2005, as well as a certified quality management system by accredited certification body of the Ministry of Defence. 

Technical Overhaul Institute Čačak is an institution of the Serbian Armed Forces whose core business is technical maintenance and overhaul of armament and military equipment, including appropriate related systems, generators and devices. Based on developed overhaul technology, available capacities and long experience in this field of technology, the Institute is able to run a successful overhaul of combat means: tracked and wheeled vehicles, artillery and rocket weapons, small arms, means of communication, optical and optoelectronic devices, energy resources and rocketry. The Institute also provides the civil sector with its developed capacities. 

Owing to successfully developed overhaul technology, available capacities, human resources and long experience, it successfully performs:
technical maintenance and repair of engines, motor vehicles, agricultural, construction and mining equipment, spare parts manufacturing, machining, machining of engine parts, heat and dry-heat treatment, regeneration of parts, overhaul and repair of personal and sporting weapons, chemical and galvanic protection, repair and verification of measuring devices.

## 6.2.  Equipping And Modernization Of The Serbian Armed Forces

Supplying the Armed Forces with weapons and military equipment is carried out through research, development and acquisition of new assets and systems, and modernization of existing, promising weapon systems. In the process of supply with weapons and military equipment scientific-research and production capacities of the Republic of Serbia are primarily used, in accordance with the technological capabilities and economic justification. In procurement of assets from the import, priority is given to joint projects with foreign partners, primarily those in-

volving technology transfer and engagement of business capacities in

![111_image_0.png](111_image_0.png) the Republic of Serbia. 

A set of priorities has been determined in this area, the most important being: supply with telecommunications and IT equipment for the integrated system of communications, development and supply with equipment of the Centre for the Airspace Sovereignty Control; providing radar stations with surveillance radars 3D and computer network for data processing and equipping the army units following M21 model, then equipping with multi-purpose combat aircraft and trainer aircraft for basic training "Lasta", modern reconnaissance means, air defence medium-range missile system, wheeled armed combat vehicles, equipping with trainers and simulators of complex weapon systems, equipping with transport planes and transport helicopters, procurement of unmanned aerial vehicles for reconnaissance units and equipping units for participation in multinational operations. 

Modernization of weapons and military equipment includes promising systems and assets. It is implemented in domestic scientific research institutions and production facilities. 

Priorities in modernization area are the modernization of tanks, combat vehicles and self-propelled artillery weapons, helicopters and aircraft, radars and missile systems, as well as the ship's weapons systems.

6.3 . MILITARY INFRASTRUCTURE
Defence infrastructure includes compounds and facilities used by the Ministry of Defence and the Serbian Armed Forces, housing and other facilities relevant to defence. In quantitative terms, or the available surface area, defence infrastructure exceeds the needs of the Ministry of Defence and the Serbian Armed Forces; however, in qualitative terms, or the state of infrastructure, it does not meet the current needs of the Ministry of Defence and the Serbian Armed Forces. To improve the situation, "Master Plan" of disposal was developed, and the Government of the Republic of Serbia adopted the conclusions on the disposal of certain military compounds. 

One of the problems the Ministry of Defence is facing with is the storage and preservation of ordnance, their surplus and replacement. It, unlike other assets and military equipment, must be maintained even when it is surplus, as it represents a potential threat. Ordnance storage 110

![112_image_1.png](112_image_1.png) Ministry of Defence and the Serbian Armed Forces. For this purpose, the necessary spatial and urban plans for promising garrisons will be developed, relying on the existing compounds, with a maximum rationalization of deployment of units and engagement of space. It is planned to transform promising barracks into the military bases and the deployment of the Ministry of Defence and the Serbian Armed Forces in one location. In principle, all planned activities will focus on the dislocation from urban areas, enlarging military compounds and concentrating all activities of military training on the smaller number of locations possible. Effective procedure for regular and capital maintenance of facilities will be established, as well as regulation of the area of financing construction and urban activities. 

Grouping the units, i.e. reducing the number of garrisons and garrison towns, reduces the total cost of the defence system. In addition, construction, adaptation, modification and modernization of the facilities would improve the conditions for life and work of the members of the Ministry of Defence and the Serbian Armed Forces, as well as the accommodation of movable tangible assets.

Defence industry, in function of new technologies development

![113_image_0.png](113_image_0.png)

under control of the security system, monitors and stimulates the development of new technologies from the civilian sector significant for the production of weapons and military equipment and is in possession of immense potential and vitality.

Defence industry of Serbia comprises companies producing and finalising weapons and military equipment, cooperative and service companies, scientific institutions, institutes and laboratories. The present corpus of the Defence industry consists of 11 specialised companies with approximately 11.000 employees. Furthermore, Defence industry includes 27 companies with individual, additional capacities for production in the field of metallurgy, metal processing, machine building, chemical industry, textile and leather and footwear industries, complementing the resources for production of weapons and military equipment. 

The required capacities for production of weapons and military equipment, in accordance with the needs of the Serbian Armed Forces equipping, are defined within the Ministry of Defence and companies are not focused solely on complying with the domestic needs but also on exporting to world markets. A tendency of growth of exports is the result of a synergistic effect of restoring political relations with the traditional customer countries, but also the focus of the Serbian defence industry on offering high quality products. The presence of the defence industry in the world market encourages further economic development and world integrations through various forms of military, scientific, technical and economic cooperation, provide greater opportunity for product placement.

The existing "Defence industry of Serbia" group under the authority of the Ministry of Defence decidedly orientated on production in the Defence industry includes six companies with a tendency of expanding onto three more companies.

Production programme of the **HK "Krušik"** company is based around the production of: initial, classical ordnance and new missile systems, ordnance for civilian market and material processing. The planned production of hexogen and octogen will cover the military industry requirements. The completion of the initial ordnance factory will enable the existing assortment expansion by including smoke and illumination ammunition.

tions in the defence of the Republic of Serbia, is organised and systematic activity of military scientific institutions and high military schools to encourage systematic creative work directed at acquiring new knowledge, ideas, innovation, developing technologies and their application in the field of defence. Along with higher education, scientific research activities should become the main factor and instigator of the defence forces growth. 

The main goal of scientific research in the Ministry of Defence and the Serbian Armed Forces is to increase the efficiency of the Armed Forces development in all its aspects, including the application of new technologies aimed at enhancing the Armed Forces, in accordance with its missions and tasks in modern conditions, including the development and production of weapons and military equipment as well as training of scientific personnel. The main aims of the development of scientific research in the future are to increase the impact of science and technology on the overall development of defence of Serbia and the development and promotion of international defence cooperation. 

Towards the end of 2008, the **Council for Scientific Research** was established within the Ministry of Defence as an expert and advisory body of the Minister of Defence, which considers issues related to scientific research in the field of defence. There are numerous issues which the Council considers and makes conclusions in the form of proposal for the Minister of Defence to undertake certain activities. Furthermore, the Council reviews the situation and proposes decisions in the field of basic, applied and developmental research of interest to the defence, as well as for the organisation, financing and implementation of the content of the scientific research. The Council members are distinguished professionals and recognized experts in the fields of science relevant to the defence from both the defence system and civilian structures (SANU, Ministry of Science and Technological Development, the Conference of the University of the Republic of Serbia, etc.). 

With the aim of monitoring the key scientific research projects, a Permanent working body of the Council for the scientific research was formed at the Ministry of Defence, tasked with reviewing and imple대

Technical Test Centre (TTC) is a military scientific institution in charge of running the final, verification and homologation tests for weapons and military equipment, and metrological provision of the Defence system, existing under its current name from August 1, 2006. Technical Test Centre was established within the Defence system reform by consolidating three centres - Army Technical Test Centre, Air Force Test Centre and the Naval Test Centre. All three centres, which were incorporated into TOC, were made in different periods of the Armed Forces development. Air Force Test Centre continues the tradition of the Air Force Test Group formed on December 14, 1933 and the institution was officially founded in 1949. Although the beginnings of

![123_image_0.png](123_image_0.png) the Technical Test Centre are connected with the year of 1973, the most important laboratory, weapons and military equipment Test Centre in Nikinci was founded in 1951 as a main training ground of the Directorate General of the ammunition industry. Navy Test Centre was established in 1980 in Split, only to move to Tivat in 1991, and then to Belgrade after the collapse of the state union.

The basic purpose of the Technical Test Centre is to examine the quality of weapon systems at all stages of its development - from design to serial production, and later in operational conditions viz. attempts to extend its shelf life. 

Technical Test Centre is engaged in scientific research in the area of developing methods and equipment for testing and calibration and establishing standards and other documents for examination and assessment of quality. 

Technical Test Centre is the first institution in the Defence system with recognised and certified quality management system according to SRPS ISO 9001 standards. 

Technical Test Centre has 25 laboratories and two ammunition test polygons with 2.000 measuring devices and over 6.000 studies and reports on the research completed. TTC participated in the development of more than 700 defence standards and over 350 test methods developed and has issued over 20.000 certificates of completed calibration. 

Military Geographical Institute (MGI) is an institution belonging to the Serbian Armed Forces and the highest professional and executive body of the Geodetic Service, with the aim to collect, create, update, standardise, analyse, distribute and store spatial data in analogue and digital form for the needs of the Serbian Armed Forces, defence system and civil defence system institutions. Its missions and tasks include research and development in production covering fields of geodesy, photogrammetry, cartography, geographic information systems, map reproduction, metrology and other geo-disciplines in order to produce geo-topographic materials. 

Military Geographical Institute was established in 1876, as a geographical division of the General Staff of the Serbian Armed Forces. It was renamed to Geographical Institute in 1920 and its current name dates back to 1923. Ever since it was established in 1876 to the present day, MGI has been within the Armed Forces, except between 1920 and 1941 and 2005 and 2010, when it was a part of the Ministry of Defence.

8. DEFENCE FUNDING 
127
The Law on Budget System Law regulates the area of public finance management in a new, completely different way. The bottom line

![128_image_0.png](128_image_0.png)

is that the new regulation embraces and incorporates the principles and procedures of internationally recognized framework and methodology. This step could be considered an actual milestone towards complying with the regulations of developed countries and opening the possibility for total European integration. An integrated budget system with a methodology ensuring efficient and transparent planning, programming, budgeting and execution has been created, replacing the outdated fragmented management of public finances approach. Definition of a common legal framework, unified budget classification and uniform criteria and documents required for the production and control of each segment within an integrated budget system have made the setting up of the new concept possible. 

Defence budget is planned and adopted in accordance with the reformed normative-systems solutions, and has therefore undergone a certain content and procedural changes in comparison with the previous ones. Therefore, it can fully meet the requirements set by the Budget Law, satisfying, in consistence with that, the required form and content so as to fully comply with the set purpose and tasks. 

Defence Planning Committee has a significant role in the process of managing the Defence system. Defence planning system provides the necessary capacity building, operation and development of Defence, rational employment of the available resources and transparency of financial resources for Defence purposes disposing. 

Planning funding for Defence is based on the realistic economic potential of Serbia, aims and tasks of the Defence system, security assessment, defined priorities and assumed obligations. The plan clearly defines the long-term, medium term and annual priorities and provides economical and efficient use of funds approved for the defence. 

Based on the strategic choices and needs identified, the system of planning, programming, budgeting and execution through the development plans and programs directly defines the Defence resource management in view of building capacity for achieving the assigned missions and tasks. tablished by the Budget Law of the Republic of Serbia. 

![129_image_0.png](129_image_0.png)

The main sources of financing the operation and development of the Defence system are: funds from the budget of the Republic of Serbia, its own revenue, allocated surplus revenues from previous years, donations from foreign countries and international organizations, income from sale of non-financial assets, unspent funds from donations from previous years and credit-debit of the Republic of Serbia abroad. 

Planning of special funds in the budget of the Republic of Serbia, efforts shall be made to provide financial resources for equipping Air Force and Air Defence with complex combat systems, as well as participation of the Serbian Armed Forces and other defence structures in multinational operations and other activities outside the Republic of Serbia. 

For each fiscal year, the Ministry of Defence prepares a draft financial plan for the Defence, in particular ensuring that the plan be harmonized with the plans and programs for the development and functioning of the Defence in accordance with the Memorandum on Budget and Economic and Fiscal Policy and *Guidelines for the Preparation of the Budget of the Republic of Serbia.* 
Transparency in Defence planning and financing is achieved through the procedure of budget preparation, adoption, implementation, control and audit. Planning, development, adoption and execution of the financial plan of Defence are based on a single budget classification. 

The main consideration in designing the Defence system financing is to provide the necessary capacity building of the Defence system with a more favourable cost structure. The new cost structure should allow for a greater share of total costs related to investment and operating costs, while reducing the share of personnel costs. The target cost structure of the Defence budget is as follows: 50% personnel costs, 30% operating costs and 20% investment costs. Bearing in mind the current state of defence, and the present structure of the costs of defence, the target structure will be reached gradually. Such a cost structure will be established no later than 2016. 

For regular operation and development of Defence, in accordance with the methodology of the International Monetary Fund - Government Finance Statistics 1986, it is necessary to provide at least 2% of gross domestic product, with no funds for the payment of military pensions. 

Providing at least 2% of gross domestic product for the regular functioning and development of the defence system and planning of 128

![130_image_0.png](130_image_0.png)

special funds in the budget of the Republic of Serbia for equipping Air Force and Air Defence of Serbia with complex combat systems, as well as providing special funds in the budget for the participation of the Serbian Armed Forces and other defence forces in multinational operations and other activities abroad, will create conditions for the revitalisation of the capability of the Serbian Armed Forces to carry out missions and tasks for national defence.

The following table gives an overview of the data on macroeconomic indicators for the period from 2010 to 2013, provided funds for defence funding in 2010 and the projection of defence expenditure for the period from 2010 to 2013. (Source: Memorandum on the Budget and Economic and Fiscal Policy for 2011, with projections for 2012 and 2013).

The cost structure for 2010, disregarding funds for military pensions, funds for personnel costs account for 65%, operating for 22.2%
and investments for 12.8%. In the period from 2010 to 2013, it will be aimed at setting the cost structure in which the funds for personnel costs account for 50%, operating for 30% and investment with 20% of the defence budget.

# 9. International Defence Cooperation

Security risks of the contemporary world confirm profound interdependence of countries and regions and indivisibility of global security
- hence the need for cooperation and cooperative approach to security at the regional and global levels. The solid basis for such an approach consists of equal dialogue, partnership and joint efforts of states and other entities in the international community for achieving, maintaining and promoting security.

Building and upgrading partnerships with more than 60 countries and armed forces worldwide and the global and regional security institutions is in function of the foreign policy of the Republic of Serbia and contributes to upholding national security, providing international support to defence reform and creating conditions for re-establishing our defence industry in the world market of weapons and military equipment. Furthermore, it provides access to new technologies, which has a positive impact on the stability and overall economic development.

![134_image_1.png](134_image_1.png)

International cooperation in the field of defence takes place at the

![135_image_0.png](135_image_0.png)

multilateral and bilateral levels, both directly and within international organizations. 

Successful implementation of the planned activities in the field of international cooperation generated excellent results in restoring and upgrading the reputation of the Republic of Serbia in the international community and winning support for the execution of tasks and missions of the MoD and SAF.

9.1. MULTILATERAL COOPERATION
Republic of Serbia, a key factor of stability of the Western Balkans, is committed to active participation in all processes of cooperation and joint actions within international organizations. It advocates the promotion of the concept of cooperative security. Through cooperation with the Organization of the United Nation, European and other international organizations and regional structures, Republic of Serbia contributes to the construction and upgrading of her own, regional and global security. 

United Nations (UN) is among the crucial mechanisms for bolstering security and upholding the international world peace. The organization brings together 192 member states in order to preserve peace and security. The Republic of Serbia defines its relationship with the United Nations based on the respect for the UN Charter and resolutions of the General Assembly and Security Council. 

![135_image_1.png](135_image_1.png)

135
The orientation of Serbia towards cooperation with the UN is the

![136_image_0.png](136_image_0.png)

defining factor in foreign policy, through which the improvement of relations with other organizations and institutions can be successfully achieved. Achieving full cooperation with the UN is an important factor in the efforts of Serbia to preserve its territorial integrity and sovereignty. 

Defence cooperation with the United Nations, is predominantly based around in the UN multinational operations and the implementation of international commitments in the field of disarmament. 

Cooperation in the area of multinational operations is realized through the participation and increasing the number of the professional members of the MOD and the Serbian Armed Forces in the UN multinational operations, one of the chief goals of Serbia in pursuing its foreign policy goals and giving an active contribution to preserving the peace and stability in the world. 

Cooperation in the field of disarmament implies the obligation to monitor the implementation of the UN Convention on the Prohibition of the use and proliferation of landmines (Ottawa Convention), to prohibit or restrict the use of certain types of conventional weapons and ban weapons of mass destruction, biological and chemical weapons. 

European Union is the key partner of Serbia and support in the process of democratic and economic reforms in the country. EU membership is the primary foreign policy goal to the Republic of Serbia. 

Through the process of European integration, Serbia stands ready to build its own security capacities and as well as committed to contribute to the implementation of the Common Security and Defence Policy (CSDP) of the EU. 

In addition to the Ministry of Defence, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Ministry of Internal Affairs, Ministry of Finance, Ministry of Economy and Regional Development and the Office for European Integration, is in charge of conducting activities in the Republic of Serbia CSDP. In strengthening cooperation within the CSDP, as well as in regional initiatives, Serbia upholds its security and contributes to the stability of the entire SEE region. The Ministry of Defence is engaged in the process of the normative-legal harmonization of acts within its competence in the process of harmonization with the EU tradition. Rounding up the strategic and regulatory framework by adopting policies and legislation that normatively define and regulate the system of defence, the Ministry of Defence has fulfilled its obligations under the National Programme for Integration of Serbia into EU accession process. 

![137_image_0.png](137_image_0.png)

the mandate of the EU. 

Republic of Serbia has formally become a member of the **NATO**
Program Partnership for Peace (PfP) having signed, after the invitation addressed from the NATO Summit in Riga on November 29, 2006, the framework document on December 14, 2006. The framework and key areas of the engagement of Serbia have been defined in the Presentation Document, which was presented at the NATO headquarters in Brussels, September 5, 2007. On that occasion, Serbia emphasized her intention to assume a part of responsibility for a stable and lasting peace in the region, participate in peacekeeping operations under UN mandate and achieve interoperability of the armed forces with those of the NATO countries. 

Serbian objectives of cooperation with NATO in the defence area under the auspices of the Partnership for Peace are as follows: creating conditions for the Alliance and its members to support Serbia in the process of defence reform and the necessary capacity building to pre136

137
serve the national interests of Serbia, as well as the successful engagement of the Serbian Armed Forces in peacebuilding and peacekeeping

![138_image_0.png](138_image_0.png)

![138_image_1.png](138_image_1.png)

in the region and worldwide. In this way, the foreign policy of the Republic of Serbia in the process of strengthening the international position and its active participation in building and upholding peace at the regional and global levels is supported. 

The partnership of the Republic of Serbia and NATO is an expression of the common belief that stability and security in the territories of the Member States and partners can only be achieved through cooperation and joint action. The current priorities of the participation of Serbia in the Partnership for Peace are related primarily to the tasks that will create the conditions for successful operation of the Mission of the Republic of Serbia to NATO, as well as the engagement of the available mechanisms of the Partnership for Peace. 

The cooperation under the auspices of the Partnership for Peace is being gradually upgraded, additionally advanced by the security agreement implementation. Individual Partnership Programme between Serbia and NATO, which sets the basis for engaging in all other available mechanisms of the Partnership for Peace, has established the cooperation between Serbia and NATO on a real level, according to the Presentation Document. Within the planning and review framework, significant capacities of the Republic of Serbia for cooperation with NATO have been planned. implementation of the defence reform and achieving interoperability of

![139_image_0.png](139_image_0.png) the Serbian Armed Forces, a Serbia - NATO group for Defence Reform was established in February 2006. Due to the exchange of experiences in reforming the defence system with the Euro-Atlantic states, the operation of this Group has been rated as highly successful. 

The intense involvement of Serbia and her defence system in the Partnership for Peace supports the implementation of foreign policy priorities in function of the aspirations towards European integration, as it facilitates the political, security and defence cooperation between the Member States. 

Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE) is the largest regional organization of the Euro-Atlantic and Euro-Asian region with a total of 56 member states. The main functions of OSCE are as follows: early warning, conflict prevention, crisis management and postconflict recovery. OSCE has a catholic approach and covers three dimensions: the protection of human rights, military-political and economic and environmental. 

The Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe organisation plays a major role in fostering security and stability, overarching all their dimensions. It is particularly important to stress the readiness of Serbia to engage in all activities of OSCE, especially those taken to enhance confidence and security consolidation of the regional countries. 

Further emphasis should be placed on the fact that the Republic of Serbia, in accordance with OSCE principles, embraces the following principles in the defence and security areas: transparency in the matters of defence, the exchange of information on certain categories of the armed forces units, the implementation of confidence and security building measures and resolving disputes through peaceful means, generally accepted standards for defining the place and role of the armed forces, command and responsibilities of civil authorities, promoting the principles of international humanitarian and military laws. 

The Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe Mission to Serbia actively participates in projects within the security sector reform in the field of upholding the parliamentary control of the armed forces, support for interdepartmental cooperation and joint management in the security sector, as well as supporting the education and strengthening the capacity and role of civil society in the security sector. Cooperation on a number of programs that have a regional character has been established 138

139
through the Mission, especially programs concerning assistance in formulating the proposed new laws in the process of defence reform and

![140_image_0.png](140_image_0.png)

training certain social structures for civil control over the security sector. 

Another area of cooperation between the Ministry of Defence and OSCE Mission to Serbia is the "consolidation of the democratisation process in the security sector of Serbia" project in the period between 2010 and 2012. The project aims at strengthening the management principles of the armed forces and consolidating the democratic character of civil-military relations in Serbia. 

In accordance with the primary foreign policy goals to **further enhance the regional cooperation** and strengthen relations with the neighbouring countries and South-East Europe, Serbia is trying to strengthen her security taking part in regional initiatives and contribute to stability in the region of SEE through dialogue and cooperation. 

Serbia is committed to further development and upgrading of stability in the region through membership in the following regional initiatives: the process of South East European Cooperation Process (SEECP),
the Regional Cooperation Council (RCC), the Cooperation Process of Defence Ministers of South-eastern Europe (SEDM), Forum for helping South-eastern Europe (SEEC), the Initiative for Cooperation in South-East Europe (SECI), the Adriatic-Ionian Initiative (AI), Central European Initiative (CEI) and the Organization for Black Sea Economic Cooperation
(BSEC). Serbia has an observer status in a regional initiative developed in the South-Eastern Europe and the US-Adriatic Charter (A-5). 

Through these initiatives Serbia offers capacities on the regional level: CBRN Centre in Kruševac, the Military Medical Academy, Centre for peacekeeping operations in Belgrade, the "Jug" base, Centre for the destruction of ammunition and weapons TOI Kragujevac and the Centre for dog breeding and training guide dogs in Niš. By signing the joint statement of the members of the Forum to help countries of Southeast Europe Ministers of Defence in October 2009, the CBRN Centre in Kruševac was promoted as one of three regional centres under the said initiative.

9.2. BILATERAL COOPERATION
Through cooperation and partnership with the defence systems of other countries, bilateral cooperation in defence contributes to upgrading the national security of Serbia and provides a broader international support for the defence reform. Furthermore, it contributes to providing

![141_image_0.png](141_image_0.png)

opportunities and conditions for the return of the Serbian defence industry to the world market of arms and military equipment. Successful implementation of the planned activities and those initiated by the foreign governments and businesses ensures the support in renewal and enhancement of the scientific-technical and military-economic cooperation. Furthermore, the renewal of the military-economic cooperation provides opportunities for participation of other industries of the Republic of Serbia on the world market. 

The priorities of the bilateral cooperation are defined by regions, countries and international organizations in accordance with the defined interests of the defence systems. The process of defining priorities is by its nature open and dynamic and as such subject to periodic analysis and evaluation. 

In accordance with the defined orientation of the Serbian foreign policy, in line with the political, economic and security impact of certain countries, the priority of bilateral relations in the field of defence cooperation is given to the United States, Russia, China and the European Union. 

Bilateral cooperation with the neighbouring countries is a highly significant component of cooperation in defence, since it contributes to building trust, security and stability in the region.

9.3. MEMBERS OF THE SERBIAN ARMED FORCES 
IN INTERNATIONAL MISSIONS
141
Throughout its history, as a member of the United Nations, the Republic of Serbia has confirmed commitment to the collective security

![142_image_0.png](142_image_0.png)

system and stands ready to uphold security of the home territory as well as to participate beyond her borders in an international environment, in accordance with the national and state interests. In this way, the tradition of participation in the UN peacekeeping operations started in 1956 continues. 

Participation in peacekeeping operations has a long tradition and is reflected in the participation of the Yugoslav National Army - JNA (Yugoslavia) in the UN missions:
- UNEF I (1956-1967) the UN mission in the Sinai. The contingent of JNA in this mission was the largest contingent. The total of 22 rotations was made including with 14,265 personnel. 

- UNOCI (1960-1964) in DR Congo. JNA deployed a unit for airtechnical support.

- UNYOM (1963-1964) the UN mission in Yemen. JNA deployed

![142_image_1.png](142_image_1.png)

a detachment. 

- UNAVEM (1989-1991) mission in Angola. JNA deployed military observers.

![143_image_0.png](143_image_0.png)

Upon admission of the State Union of Serbia and Montenegro into the UN, the participation in peacekeeping operations continued in 2002 with the deployment of military observers in the UN peacekeeping mission in East Timor (UNMISET). 

In 2003, two military observers were deployed as part of the UN
peacekeeping mission in Liberia (UNMIL). Gradually, the number of observers increased. That same year, the UN peacekeeping mission in DR
Congo (MONUC) was started, including a six-strong medical team for evacuation by air (AMET). 

In 2004, the military observers were deployed in the UN peacekeeping missions in Ivory Coast (UNOCI) and Burundi (ONUBA). 

In 2009, as part of the UN peacekeeping mission in the Republic of Chad and the Central African Republic (MINURCAT), the Republic of Serbia deployed a medical contingent as part of the Norwegian field hospital. From 2010, the medical contingent of Serbia has independently participated in the mission by providing medical assistance to members of the mission and the civilian population. 

Members of the Ministry of Defence and the Serbian Armed Forces are currently deployed as military observers, staff officers and the medical teams in multinational operations of the United Nations in Liberia, Ivory Coast, Democratic Republic of Congo, Republic of Chad and the Central African Republic. In 2010 the Republic of Serbia took part in the UN peacekeeping missions in the Republic of Cyprus and Lebanon. 

The members of the Serbian Armed Forces and other defence forces to be deployed as part of the UN multinational operations undergo special preparations. Main tasks of the military observers are patrolling, control and prevention of illegal trade and implementation of peace agreements, while the duties of the staff officers are performed within the mission command and headquarters and units. The medical teams are engaged in the medical evacuation of the injured and sick members of the mission by air, as well as providing medical assistance to members of the mission and the local population. 

142

The selection of candidates to be trained for participation in multi-

![144_image_0.png](144_image_0.png)

national operations is carried out from questionnaires filled in by all the 143
personnel within the Serbian Armed Forces and the Ministry of Defence.

![144_image_1.png](144_image_1.png)

Based on the data obtained, the Centre for Peacekeeping Operations establishes and updates an incorporated database of all of the personnel who took part in the survey. The officer of the Joint Operations Command in charge of the selection establishes a committee to select the candidates to be trained to participate in the planned multinational operations. 

Based on the test of language proficiency results, health and psycho-physical ability, professional qualifications, personal motivation of candidates and interview, the Committee makes a list of the selected candidates to be trained to participate in multinational operations. 

The training of the Serbian Armed Forces takes place in training centres under a special program put together by the operational level command and approved by the Chief of Staff of the Serbian Armed Forces. Coordination of the training is a task performed by the Centre for Peacekeeping Operations. 

Future plans include increased involvement of both individuals and units in the UN multinational operations, as military observers, staff officers, members of medical teams and contingents, in accordance with the interests and capacities of the Republic of Serbia. 

The scope and nature of participation of forces in multinational operations is harmonized with the increasing potential and capabilities of the Republic of Serbia and includes the involvement of individuals,

![145_image_0.png](145_image_0.png) medical teams and units of the level of platoon - company of soldiers who can perform surveillance, medical, military and police and antiterrorist roles and tasks within the command and headquarters of the multinational contingents on the level of brigade and in the command and headquarters of the mission. 

In addition to participation of the Serbian Armed Forces and other defence forces in the United Nations multinational operations a future prospect could be their deployment as part of the European Union operations.

9.4. ARMS CONTROL BY INTERNATIONAL TREATIES Federal Republic of Yugoslavia, with the Republic of Serbia as one of its constituent parts, joined the international arms control mechanisms having signed the Dayton Peace Accord in 1996. This agreement defines the number restrictions on five basic types of weapons and systems (battle tanks, armoured combat vehicles, artillery weapons, combat aircraft and assault helicopters) in the present day Republic of Croatia, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Montenegro and Serbia.

Arms control within the MoD jurisdiction is carried out by the Verification centre which was formed 1996 as the Department of Arms Control of the Yugoslav Army General Staff. Since 1996, the provisions of the Dayton Peace Accord for Annex 1B, Article IV and Article V are being implemented. The first inspection was conducted on August 26, 1996. Over the period of inspections a high level of transparency and trust has been achieved in the region, defence forces levels balanced and stabilized and confirmed that arming was below the established limits. The Republic of Serbia has made a significant contribution to the adoption and implementation of the Agreement on sub-regional arms control, confirming in a concrete way the importance it assigns to regional cooperation. 

The OSCE return in 2001 meant that the Republic of Serbia took full participation in building confidence and security under the "Vienna Document 1999" which includes the mutual inspection of the reported combat units and formations with 55 other OSCE member states. 

On the basis of the "Vienna Document 1999" the Ministry of Defence exchanges yearly reports on the armed forces with the OSCE
member states and carries out the specified number of inspections at 144

145
home and abroad. Furthermore, every five years, the MoD organises a

![146_image_0.png](146_image_0.png)

By achieving significant results in recent years in all three assigned

missions, Serbian Armed Forces (SAF) are restoring the repute and the trust of the nation that was always present.

Furthermore, the development of multidimensional civil-military cooperation suggests that SAF are present in all activities of our society on daily basis. Furthermore, within SAF there are several institutions of cultural and historical significance with a long tradition, dealing with activities of wider social influence and importance.

The Serbian Armed Forces as an integral part of the Serbian society accept and support the principles of civil and democratic control as a guarantee to serve the people and nation in the best manner.

10.1. DEMOCRATIC AND CIVIL CONTROL
The democratic and civil control over the armed forces takes up a significant position in the process of the defence system reform. Precise constitutional and legal designation of the role of the armed forces and the possibility of its control is one of the crucial indicators of the overall democratic tendencies of the entire society. Therefore, the civil control is one of the most significant prerequisites of the full integration of the Republic of Serbia into the current trends of the international community. 

The overarching interest of the Republic of Serbia is to have the democratic and civil control over the armed forces conducted according to the parliamentary model of European democracy, in order to be integrated into the modern economical, political and security integrations as quickly as possible. Such a model will ensure the central role to the Parliament and its bodies and working groups and exercising effective control over the armed forces and other defence subjects and security via the Serbian Government and especially its Ministries.

The democratic and civil control over the armed forces provides for all the decisions on the development and application of defence system assets to be under the jurisdiction of the democratically elected organs of civil authorities. They are the representatives of the democratically expressed will of the people, while the representatives of the defence system are appointed.

The underlying essence of the democratic and civil control over the defence system of the Republic of Serbia is to have the democratically elected representatives of the political power gain insight into the defence system state condition. The aim of the control is to determine whether the actions of the defence system are in accordance with the constitutionally determined position and with the policies specified in the bylaws established by the representative and executive authorities.

![151_image_0.png](151_image_0.png)

The principles of the democratic and civil control over the armed forces has been set as the constitutional principle according to which the Serbian Armed Forces are under democratic and civil control, and the National Assembly is in charge of the security service control. The democratic and civil control over the armed forces places a special focus on control over the use and development of the Serbian Armed Forces, internal and external military expenditure control, tracking and informing the public on SAF combat readiness, providing free access to information of public interest and establishing responsibility for performing military duties according to legal provisions. The democratic and civil control over the Serbian Armed Forces is the duty of the National Assembly, the President of the Republic of Serbia, executive authorities, Ombudsman and other state authorities according to their responsibility, citizens and the general public.

However, in democratic societies, the central role is played by the

![152_image_0.png](152_image_0.png)

151
citizens. Their role in the civil control over the defence system is extremely important and can be exercised in a number of ways. A successful model of relations between the citizen and the defence system enables democratic control of the defence system. Only a healthy and professional relation of the defence system personnel and civil democratic structures, including the media contributes to the democratic control. This relationship has to be based on an open and straightforward communication. The media have a significant and productive role in the democratic and civil control over the defence system. Media is a tool for establishing an even firmer, more comprehensive and complex democratic control over the defence system, representing one of the prerequisites for participation in the international integrations. The defence system has to accept the media and their role as such, resulting in the development of this area. 

Non-governmental organizations have a significant role in the democratic and parliamentary control over the armed forces primarily due to: the independent analysis and information on the defence system, military and defence issues; tracking and stimulating compliance with the law and human rights in the defence area; placing to the Parliament agenda security questions important for the society as a whole; participating in parliamentary debates and organising courses and seminars; providing alternative expert views related to the Governmental Safety Policy and defence budget; encouraging public debates for the formulation of possible political options; supporting political decisions on national security and the way of implementing them; education of public and facilitating alternative discussions in public sector.

10.2. CIVIL-MILITARY COOPERATION
Following changes in the operational environment and projecting its ability to adjust to new security and military challenges, the Serbian Armed Forces develop civil-military cooperation feature for planning, organization and implementation of coordination and cooperation between the Serbian Armed Forces and civilian structures. Civil-military cooperation in the Serbian Armed Forces is organized at the strategic, operational and tactical levels. Depending on the task, units and types of operations performed by the Serbian Armed Forces, civil-military cooperation is organized from the highest level,

![153_image_0.png](153_image_0.png)

(J-9), an organisational unit of the General Staff of the Serbian Armed Forces. In addition to the civil-military cooperation services in the units, this cooperation is carried out through its operations centres, and offices in the day to day life of the armed forces, established in order to provide locations where citizens and civil structures can turn to armed forces for help. For the purpose of training the Serbian Armed Forces personnel in performing the tasks of civil-military cooperation and achieving their allocated functions, two offices for civil-military cooperation have been opened - one in Vranje and another in Kraljevo. 

Through civil-military cooperation, a wide range of resources can be engaged: information, personnel, combat and utility equipment, as well as the involvement of military and non-military personnel as specialists in civil-military cooperation to assist the civilian population and authorities. 

In the past, the practical activities of civil-military cooperation in the Serbian Armed Forces were aimed at providing support to civil authorities and citizens to address the consequences of natural disasters 152 ગા
DIC

![154_image_0.png](154_image_0.png)

throughout the country (protection and placing of the population in
cases of floods, participation in extinguishing forest fires) and providing support to the population, especially in the Ground Safety Zone, as well as providing medical care to sick and disabled persons in the form of organized action "Medical Doctor in the Country" ("Lekar na selu"), in the repair and clearing of roads in winter conditions in remote and inaccessible villages, ensuring water supply in the dry season, participation in humanitarian actions and the like.

Ever since it was founded, the **Yugoslav Air Force Museum (JRV**

![155_image_0.png](155_image_0.png)

Museum) has been extensively engaged in record keeping, collection, preservation and exhibition of objects, which were used in the aviation, air force and air defence over the past hundred years and is the guardian of tradition and chronicler of the Air Force.

Yugoslav Air Force Museum with its abundance of exhibits, aviation literature, photographs, video and film records, technical documents and historical materials about the units and establishments of the Air Force has been a kind of temple of our aviation thoughts and heritage for over fifty years. Yugoslav Air Force Museum was established at the beginning of the 1957, at the Air Force Command as the Department of History and Museum. Ever since it was established, the JRV Museum has systematically and consistently collected museum assets and various historical and technical documents, the testimony of the origin and development of various aspects of aviation in our air force. The first exhibit included in the collection of aircraft, is a domestic aircraft for basic training Fizir FN. 

JRV Museum possesses a remarkable collection of aircraft. Particularly interesting are the planes from World War II where, with the ex-

![156_image_1.png](156_image_1.png) and Allies are included. The quality and quantity of collections, places the JRV Museum at the top of the world's specialist aviation museums. 

Military Archives Department continues the tradition the historical department established on February 5, 1876 by decree of Prince Milan. Under provisions of this decree on the organization of the Serbian Armed Forces General Staff a special (third) division to be established within the General Staff with a mission to collect historical data and write the history of war, to keep the entire archive and command the General Staff library. This established the first institutionalized archive practice in the Serbian Armed Forces. Continuing this tradition, the Military Archives adopted the 1876 as the year of its origination. Military Archives store materials dating from 1847 until the present day. There are also older documents - the oldest document found dates back to 1716, yet 1847 is considered the year in which the writing of the military history of the Serbian state started. The largest number of documents is in Serbian, but there are a significant number of documents written in German, Italian, French, English, Bulgarian and other languages. 

Throughout its 134 years long history, the Military Archives has kept and was obliged to keep the documents from the two Serbian-Turkish Wars, the Serbian-Bulgarian War, the First and Second Balkan Wars

![157_image_0.png](157_image_0.png)

(1912-1913), the cavalry of Serbia in World War I (1914-1918), documents on the April War, World War II in Yugoslavia (1941-1945) and documentation from the peacetime life of the Serbian Armed Forces, the Kingdom of Yugoslavia and SFRY, the FRY, the State Union of Serbia and Montenegro, and finally, the Republic of Serbia. 

Military Museum is an institution of great importance for both the Serbian Armed Forces and the cultural tradition of the state. In its two centuries long history it has recorded the rule of two Serbian dynasties, several states and regimes and collected objects from antiquity to the present day. It shared the fate of the people whose history and tradition it has preserved in numerous assets to become the proud heritage of future generations. 

After the Berlin Congress, the institutions that characterise every modern state were formed in the Principality of Serbia. Thus, Milan Obrenović IV "by the grace of God and the will of the people, Serbian Prince" issued a Decree on the Constitution of the Military Museum on August 10(22), 1878. According to the Rules for the Military Museum, written in the following year (1879), collecting and storing of the "military items" followed, comprising items from the times long gone, from rebellions and insurrections and liberation wars of the Serbian people.

Due to the crisis of the Serbian government the first permanent exhibition was not opened until 1904. Unfortunately, the museum building was destroyed by a German grenade and the exhibits saved from destruction were looted objects were evacuated in late 1915. Selected collections were then taken to Vienna and Pest Museums, with the majority of them returned between the two World Wars. 

In war infested Thessalonica in 1917, it was ordered by the Minister of the Military to start collecting military items and so the restoration of the Military Museum started. Conditions in the new state did not allow for this to happen until 1934, when King Alexander I of Yugoslavia issued a Decree on the Military Museum. The objects, collected during the war, purchases and especially gifts constituted the foundation of a permanent exhibition which was opened by the Prince Regent Pavle Kradjordjević in two buildings of the Belgrade Fortress on April 20, 1937. 

All the plans and developments were interrupted by the April war 1941, new robberies during the occupation, the destruction of buildings and collections by Anglo-American bombing in April 1944, and the bitter struggle for the liberation of Belgrade in October of the same year.

156

157
However, just as before from the Thessalonica front, even during the

![158_image_0.png](158_image_0.png) struggle for the liberation of the country, the Military Museum started collecting items from the battlefield. In the exhibition of 1952, the priority was given to the People's Liberation War. 

The museum collection of over 30.000 objects is arranged in about a dozen collections (the photo-archive alone includes around 100.000 negatives and photographs). In addition to the already mentioned photoarchive, items are arranged in a collection of prehistoric, ancient history and early Middle Ages, several collections of weapons and military equipment, a collection of clothing and uniforms, flags, medals and an art collection. These collections contain valuable items belonging to the Serbian and Yugoslav generals and statesmen, weapons and trophies of stone and bronze axes, swords, and modern weapons. Items are still obtained via gift and purchase. 

The Media Centre "Odbrana" (Defence) is a specialized military institution of the Public Relations Department of the MoD, and is the main bearer of the information and publishing affairs. The Media Centre was established in early 2010, within the framework of the organizational and mobilization changes in the Ministry of Defence. In the establishing process, the Media Centre took over all activities and tasks of the former Publishing Centre "Odbrana" as well as of the Central Military Club and the Military Publishing Institute.

The information activities of the Media Centre "Odbrana" include collecting, preparing and publishing all information regarding the activities of the Ministry of Defence, the Serbian Armed Forces and other defence system elements in the magazine "Odbrana" and on the websites of the Ministry of Defence and the Serbian Armed Forces.

The Media Centre "Odbrana" is located in the Central Military Club facility, which served as a former Warriors Club, designed by architects Zivko Piperski and Jovan Jovanovic. The building was constructed in the period from 1929 to 1931, just before the onset of World War II in 1939. In 1984, by the decision of the Belgrade City Council, the building was declared a cultural heritage and was placed under state's protection.

Magazine "Odbrana" continues the tradition of "Ratnik" ("Warrior"), the first official military media in Serbia that was first issued on 24 January 1879, due to that this day is celebrated as the Day of the Media Centre "Odbrana". In over 60 years, from 1945 to 2005, the papers
"Narodna armija", "Front" and "Vojska" had significant influence on the history of the Serbian military press. The first issue of "Odbrana" was

![159_image_0.png](159_image_0.png)

published on 1 October 2005. Since then, this magazine has been published twice a month (on 1st and 15th) as the only printed newspaper of the Ministry of Defence. Since 2006, "Odbrana" has been a member of the European Association of Military Journalists (EMPA). Media centre Odbrana was a host of EMPA Congress held in 2010.

The Media Centre "Odbrana" has had a long tradition in publishing ever since 1945, when the Military Publishing Institute was first established, with over 1.600 titles published to date. This institute publishes all the journals and papers of military experts, teachers including educational, military research and military literature such as
"Vojno delo", "Vojni Glasnik" (the Military Technical Gazette) and
"Novi Glasnik". "Vojno delo" and the "Vojnotehnicki glasnik" are scientific journals which have been placed by the Ministry of Science and Technological Development of Serbia under M52 category- as journals of national importance. As for Novi Glasnik, it is a journal of the operational and tactical level.

The Media Centre "Odbrana" has a shop "Vojna knjiga" (Military Book) in Belgrade, as the only specialized military bookshop in Serbia, which is also a souvenir shop and an army shop. A special part of the shop will soon be arranged and equipped as a promotional contact point of the Ministry of Defence, where all citizens showing interest in the defence system will be able to get all the necessary information regarding the professional service in the Serbian Armed Forces, enrolling the Military High School and Military Academy and other information that might interest the general public.

Artistic Ensemble of the Ministry of Defence "Stanislav Binički" is an institution in charge of giving a musical touch to the life in the defence system, the only ensemble in the region with a wide range of programming options affirms and represents the Serbian Armed Forces in the best light to the general public. 

The ensemble was established back in 1899, on September 26, by the order of King Alexander I Obrenović, the first symphony orchestra "The Belgrade Military Orchestra", directly subordinate to the Minister of the Military. One of the founders of this orchestra was Stanislav Binički, the author of the first Serbian opera "Rising Early" ("Na uranku") and inspiring patriotic march known "March to the River Drina" dedicated to Colonel Milivoje Stojanović, the third commander of the 2nd Infantry Regiment

ronment are the basis for cooperation between states and factors of their general progress and prosperity. Ever since it became independent in 2006, the Republic of Serbia has in no word or action sought to deteriorate the security of the region, but has by contrast sought to resolve the problems democratically and peacefully. 

Respecting the actuality of international relations, particularly the potential challenges, risks and threats, the Republic of Serbia will develop a defence system according to its needs and protect its vital interests and goals. Important aspects of the future character of security and defence of the Republic of Serbia will be: strategic commitment to full EU membership; regional cooperation as an imperative of a stable and secure environment; promotion of cooperation with the United States, China and the Russian Federation; intensifying relations with countries of Africa and Latin America. 

The main focus of the development of the defence system will be aimed at creating a new system of evaluation, which will feature: a fully professional army, a modern system of education and training, modernization and equipment, adequate infrastructure, participation in multinational operations and improvement of the standard of the Serbian Armed Forces and the Ministry of Defence.

Fully professional armed forces The Serbian Armed Forces will be completely professional starting from 2011, consisting of two elements of the same whole: active force and reserve. Active force will consist of professional members: officers, non-commissioned officers, soldiers and civilians. Reserve forces will consist of active and passive reserve. Active reserve will be determined annually for each subsequent year. Its formation and engagement will be aligned with the needs of increasing operational and functional capabilities of the armed forces to carry out the assigned missions and tasks, as well as financial sustainability. Passive reserve will consist of members of the armed forces who are in any way trained and qualified to serve in the armed forces and who have done the military service under arms in accordance with the Constitution and law. 

The Republic of Serbia will enable voluntary military service for those willing, in accordance with the law. Those who do the military service under these provisions have the opportunity to become professional members of the armed forces. Persons who opt for voluntary military service will have special benefits that will be regulated by law and

![167_image_0.png](167_image_0.png)

bylaw acts. 

Having fully professional armed forces implies a new and contemporary model of training. Training will be conducted in training centres and units. The number and type of training centres will be adjusted to the needs of the armed forces. The new training model will have both national and international characters.

Modern system of education and professional development Men and women will remain a basic factor in our defence system.

Hence, a special focus will be put on providing quality personnel for the armed forces and the defence system. 

Education and training for the armed forces and defence system purposes will primarily be implemented at the University of Defence. In addition, education and training of personnel will also be provided at colleges in the country and abroad. Furthermore, the University of Defence will be open for training personnel from abroad. Professional officers of the armed forces will be trained at the Military Academy and the Military Medical Academy, but also at the civil universities in the country and the military educational institutions abroad. Their training for the professional career will depend, above all, on the results shown at work and the needs of the armed forces and defence system. Only the most capable officers will reach highest ranks and positions in the armed forces and defence system. 

Professional non-commissioned officers will primarily be trained in the NCO Training Centres and from the ranks of professional soldiers. In addition, professional non-commissioned officers will come from the civilian structures, having completed the courses required. The development of training NCO corps will have a special importance in the field of training and support to the system of command and management. The most capable NCOs will undergo professional development abroad in accordance with the armed forces requirements.

Civilian personnel in the armed forces and defence system will be employed in accordance with the laws in force in the Republic of Serbia. Training of civilian personnel shall be aligned with the educational system in Serbia. In accordance with the system requirements, a number of civilians will be trained abroad. 

166

![168_image_0.png](168_image_0.png)

## Modernization And Equipping

A new system of values cannot be introduced without modernizing and equipping the Serbian Armed Forces. Modernization and equipping will be implemented in two ways: relying on our own capacities and in cooperation with foreign partners. Relying on our own capacities should develop and incorporate the entire system of development, production and introduction into operational use and maintenance. Special focus will be put on the defence system scientific institutions engaged in development and testing, as well as the defence industry and maintenance resources, which the defence system will retain and further improve the capacities for.

![168_image_1.png](168_image_1.png)

There has to be the intertwining of the local and international intellectual capabilities. Hence, modernization and equipping of the Serbian Armed Forces requires international cooperation in all aspects of the process, including: joint activities on designing complex weapon systems, joint development and production, and joint access to third markets.

Modernization and equipping of the armed forces will be carried out in accordance with the Long Term Defence System Development Plan, using the process of planning, programming, budgeting and execution.

Appropriate infrastructure An adequate infrastructure will be developed for the Serbian Armed Forces and the Ministry of Defence. This primarily implies the optimal number and placement of facilities for accommodation, work and housing, buildings and training ranges and infrastructure for storing ammunition and ordnance. 

In terms of facilities for accommodation, a unique facility will be built to accommodate the Ministry of Defence and the Serbian Armed Forces General Staff, thus, significantly rationalizing their deployment and cutting off the maintenance cost. Construction of this facility will, among other things, enable the re-appropriation of the existing facilities at multiple locations. 

A number of barracks and other facilities used in the defence system will be optimised. This optimization will be aligned with the operational needs of the Serbian Armed Forces and the requirements for the rationalization of positions and actions of other structures of the defence system. 

Special emphasis will be given to the development of adequate capacities for the training of the Serbian Armed Forces. This process will include: construction of training ranges at the level of the basic units, modernization of a singular training range for multiple forms of training
- "Pasuljanske livade" and construction of facilities and training infrastructure for participation in multinational operations. Facilities for ammunition and ordnance storage will be modernized in accordance with the standards in this field. All this will contribute to the safe storage and preservation, as well as prevention of the possible technical and technological disasters. 

Participation in multinational operations The defence system will take all measures under its jurisdiction to successfully implement the mission of the Armed Forces stated in the Defence Strategy - participation in building and maintaining peace in the world and the region. The implementation of this mission will be 168

![169_image_0.png](169_image_0.png)

169
mainly carried out through participation of the Serbian Armed Forces

![170_image_0.png](170_image_0.png) and other defence forces in multinational operations under the auspices of the United Nations and the European Union. 

Participation of the Serbian Armed Forces and other defence forces in multinational operations, in accordance with the law, is an attribute of our responsibility. This is as well our contribution to the development of a more stable and secure environment as a prerequisite for the development and prosperity of the state and the defence system. 

The declared forces of the Serbian Armed Forces and the defence system will be trained at home and abroad. The defence system will develop and offer its own training capacities for multinational operations.

The main asset of the defence system in this respect will be: the Military Medical Academy, Centre for Professional Development of the CBRN Personnel, the base "Jug" ("South") etc.

Improving the standard of the defence system personnel Special attention will be given to improving the standard of the Serbian Armed Forces and the defence system personnel. 

Key actions to improve the standard shall consist of the following:
provision of optimal living and working conditions, providing welfare benefits in accordance with the law and the status of the personnel; predictable career progression in line with their abilities; providing housing; retirement, health and social security. 

The new system of values implies establishing of a new mental matrix of the personnel within the armed forces and the defence system. Only the personnel trained, equipped and satisfied with the conditions of living and working can guarantee the execution of the defence system missions and the objectives.

For the Serbian Armed Forces and the defence system the future has begun.
