### Foreword

The dependency of today’s society on information and communication technologies increases every
day; over the past decade, these have changed and impacted almost every aspect of our lives. Human
activities are slowly but surely shifting, to a large extent, from physical space to cyberspace. On the one
hand, information and communication technologies make our lives easier, speeding up communication
and access to information and services. On the other hand, however, the increasing dependency of
the public and private sectors on these technologies, if insuffi ciently protected, renders them more
vulnerable, making cyber security one of the most important challenges the state has to face today.
Globalism and the signifi cance of impacts of potential cyber attacks have resulted in the need for a
conceptual and coordinated control of protection and defence of cyber space.

By adopting this Concept, the Slovak Republic has established its visions and priorities providing
for cyber security in the country. The Concept has to be seen as the “cornerstone”, the basic and
starting document for the subsequent formulation of legislation, standards, methodology, rules,
security policies and other tools necessary for ensuring the protection and defence of national
cyber space.

The Concept, based on a strategic and methodological framework shaped in NATO, EU, OECD and UN
documents for the area of cyber security, proposes the adoption and priority treatment of seven key
measures; the implementation thereof will be specifi ed in a material, time and fi nancial plan in the
form of a Concept Implementation Action Plan. The purpose of cyber security in the Slovak Republic,
as seen by the Concept, should be an open, secure and protected national cyber space, i.e. the building
of trust in the reliability and security of, without limitation, critical information and communication
infrastructure, as well as the building of certainty that this infrastructure will fulfi l its functions and
also serve national interests in cases of cyber attacks.

Cyber security ought to be perceived as one of the key components of national security. It is a complex
fi eld involving both legal and technical aspects and required trust and collaboration of the public
sector, private sector and academic institutions. The rights, duties and tasks of individual actors in
cyber space will be soon established by adopting and creating an institutional and legal framework of
cyber security; the Cyber Security Act will certainly form a substantial milestone in the perception of
cyber security in the Slovak Republic.

Cyber security can only be achieved using mutual trust and collaboration since it is only by making
mutual efforts that we can succeed in building both an open and secure cyber space from which we all
may benefi t.

### 1 Introduction

The exponential growth in the use of information and communication technologies from the second
half of the 20[th] century onwards has signifi cantly infl uenced development trends in society. Modern
information and communication technologies have substantially broadened the possibilities and
increased the effi ciency of the interaction methods between geographically remote entities from various
fi elds of the society and economy. The growing number of users of information and communication
technologies results in an increasing dependency of both the public and the private sectors on these
technologies, rendering them more vulnerable.

Besides the high dependency of society on information and communication technologies, the beginning
of the 21[st] century was marked by a signifi cant change in the global security environment and an
increasing number of asymmetrical threats with a higher degree of sophistication and impact effects.
A wide scope of potential methods of abuse and damage to electronic information, communication and
control systems as well as of a negative infl uencing of social and economic processes in the framework
of the international cyber environment thus included cyber threats among potentially serious global
threats such as international terrorism, proliferation of weapons of mass destruction, etc.

Critical control, technological, communication and security systems are endangered by new forms
of attacks, and so are those services that would, if failing or malfunctioning, seriously impact the
operation of the state (mostly in its main security areas). Dynamically developing modern technologies
make it possible for additional new security threats to emerge.

The Slovak Republic must be prepared to react to a wide spectre of existing and potential threats. At
the same time, it is aware of the fact that threats and attacks emerging in cyber space may escalate up
to a level that would require collaboration of the allies within the North Atlantic Treaty Organization
(hereinafter referred to as “NATO”) under Article 5 of the North Atlantic Treaty[1] that would result in
a collective defence and/or coordinated response. Thus, cyber security also needs to be perceived as
a subsystem of national security and cyber space as its new operational domain. The Slovak Republic
intends to cooperate with all relevant state and private cyber space actors, which respect identical
values and do not restrict the freedom and safety of the use of cyber space.

This Cyber Security Concept of the Slovak Republic for the years 2015-2020 (hereinafter referred to as
the “Concept”) defi nes the starting position and the goals of the Slovak Republic in the fi eld of cyber
security. The Concept is harmonized with the Security Strategy of the Slovak Republic and forms a basic
and starting document for the subsequent creation of regulations, standards, methodical instructions,
rules, security policies and other instruments necessary to provide for cyber security.

### 2 Basis and Principles of Cyber Security

The Concept is based on a statement and a description of the basic terms and principles, characteristics
of the current situation of the strategic, legal and institutional frameworks in the area of cyber security
in the Slovak Republic and on a strategic and methodological framework formed by NATO and European
Union (hereinafter referred to as the “EU”) documents; subsequently, the Concept formulates principles,
goals and proposed solutions.

**2.1 Basic Terms**

Cyber security is one of the defi ning elements of the security environment of the Slovak Republic
and a subsystem of national security. At a state level, _it is a system of continuous and planned_
increasing of political, legal, economic, security, defence and educational awareness, also including
the effi ciency of adopted and applied risk control measures of a technical-organizational nature
in cyber space in order to transform it into a trustworthy environment providing for the secure
operation of social and economic processes at an acceptable level of risks in cyber space.

The Slovak Republic still lacks a consistent formalized terminology in the area of cyber security. The
word cyber and its other grammatical forms do not occur in any generally binding regulation nor
in terminological dictionaries[2].

Defi nitions of the practically used terms in the cyber security area and defi nitions of key terms:
_cyber security, cyber space, national cyber space for the purposes of this Concept are specifi ed in the_
Annex no. 1 to the Concept[3]. For the real performance of state administration in the area of cyber
security and to understand the relationship between cyber security and the basic security areas
of operation of the state[4], a legally binding defi nition of the meaning of these terms is of crucial
importance[5]. The relation of cyber security to the basic security areas of operation of the state and
the mutual relation between cyber security and information security are discussed in the following
chapter of the Concept.

**2.2 Basic Principles of Cyber Security**

The fi eld of cyber security must not be seen as an isolated problem of the Slovak Republic or an
isolated problem of one or several elements of society. Due to its global nature, cyber security
is a society-wide phenomenon. Cyber security must be based on a complex approach, requiring
intense joint use of information and coordination of activities on both national and international
levels. When building cyber security, it is necessary to pursue collaboration between the civilian
and security units of the state, public and private sectors, as well as national and international
institutions. Providing for an effi cient and effective protection of cyber space must be ensured
by relevant entities that are responsible for the infrastructures of individual sectors on a national
level and by entities responsible for the operation of international infrastructures[6].

The Slovak Republic is fully in line with the principles of cyber security specifi ed in the strategic
document “Cybersecurity Strategy of the European Union”[7] as well as with the principles specifi ed
in the “Enhanced NATO Policy on Cyber Defence”[8].

**_Characteristic Features of Cyber Security_**

A signifi cant feature of cyber security is the fact that individual components of cyber space have
different owners, administrators, operators, as well as users. Failure to adhere to minimum security
rules, protection methods and minimum security measures in the area of cyber security and the lack
of unifi cation thereof increases the level of vulnerability of the operated electronic information,
communication, and control systems and in case of a cyber attack, it may even cause risks for a
selected part of for the whole of cyber space.

Managing security incidents and events does not only depend on the capacities of the public sector
but it is also signifi cantly dependent on the constructive cooperation of actors active outside the
public sector.

**_Cyber Security as a Component of the State’s Security System_**

Insuffi cient protection and defence against security incidents creates space for rendering society
itself vulnerable, with consequences throughout all social and economic processes, i.e. the
state’s basic security areas of operation (hereinafter referred to as the “security areas”) may be
seriously endangered:

     - Security interests of the Slovak Republic in foreign and defence policy.

     - Protection of constitutionality, public order, security of citizens and the state.

     - Social stability of the state.

     - Economic stability of the state.

     - Protection of the environment.

Cyber security is perceived as a key component of state security. The basic components forming
and implementing the security system of the Slovak Republic are, according to the law[9]: foreign
policy, defence planning, civil emergency planning and coordination and intelligence services.
Currently, a bill is being prepared that will recognise the protection of the national cyber space as
another key component of the security system of the state.

Globalism and the importance of the impacts of potential cyber attacks require a conceptual and
coordinated control of the protection and defence of cyber space.

**_Cyber Security and Information Security - Relations_**

For the purposes of this Concept, the defi nition of the terms cyber security and information
security is based mostly on EU documents[10]. These documents imply that these are two mutually
interconnected areas of problems, i.e. the security of the cyber environment and the security of the
information environment, or cyber security and information security.

The information environment is one of the important real environments[11] within a specifi c
framework of the socio-economic environment.

Cyber space is limited by the use of electronics and of the electronic spectrum to create, store,
modify, exchange, and use data by mutually dependent and interconnected networks.

Cyber security is a system tasked to provide the information environments of the state’s socioeconomic structures with secure, protected and adequately open cyberspace, i.e. to guarantee
security in the electronic information, communication and control systems located in this
environment, the security of the data stored, processed and transmitted in the systems and of the
services provided by these systems.

The joint task of cyber and information security is to provide, in collaboration, for information
safety, availability of systems and services, as well for the safety of the data transmitted by,
processed by and/or stored in these systems in a specifi c socio-economic environment.

**2.3 Current Situation in the Slovak Republic**

The fi eld of cyber security in the Slovak Republic has not been integrally and consistently regulated
at a national strategic level. Some attention was paid to cyber security in the document “National
Information Security Strategy of the Slovak Republic”[12] (hereinafter referred to as the “Strategy”)
and the subsequent “Action Plan for 2009 to 2013 for the National Information Security Strategy
of the Slovak Republic”[13].

An overview of documents approved by the Government of the Slovak Republic in relation to
the implementation of this Strategy as well as of other strategic and/or conceptual documents
partially related to the area of protection of cyber space and/or cyber security in provided in Annex
no. 2 to this Concept.

The Slovak Republic has adopted several regulations regulating the security of information and
communication systems and information processed and/or transmitted thereby[14].

The “Reports on the Performance of Tasks of the National Information Security Strategy of the
Slovak Republic and Tasks of the Action Plan for 2008 to 2013”[15] show that among the tasks of
a non-legislative nature, positive results have been achieved in the area of information security
mainly in the building of skills, education, prevention and readiness to managing computer security
incidents, in the removal of the consequences thereof and the subsequent restoration of information
systems in the framework of central state administration. The training of state administration
specialists is carried out mostly at the Ministry of Finance of the Slovak Republic. Increasing
awareness and education in the area of cyber and/or information security is not generally included
in the educational system of the Slovak Republic (primary and secondary schools and universities)
nor in the system of forming social awareness.

Education is not dealt with at the level of specialized majors but mostly by special courses at
selected educational institutions. Differing levels of capacities and preparedness for cyber
risks still exist. What is absent is an Centre of Excellence that would focus on questions related
to cyber security.

The collaboration of the public sector with the private sector, academic institutions and civil
society has not developed in the necessary scope and a framework of systematic, coordinated and
effi cient collaboration, mostly at a strategic level, is lacking.

_12 The Government of the Slovak Republic approved the material (mat. no. ÚV-18175/2008) on 27 August 2008 by its Resolution no. 570/2008._

_13 The Government of the Slovak Republic approved the material (mat. no. ÚV-30315/2009) on 19 January 2010 by its Resolution no. 46/2010._

_14 E.g. Act no. 45/2011 Coll. on Critical Infrastructure defi ning the organization and powers of state administration bodies in the area of_
_critical infrastructure, Act no. 351/2011 Coll. on Electronic Communications as amended._

Cyber threats are not generally seen as a suffi ciently urgent problem. It is still necessary to focus
attention on vulnerabilities that today’s society faces more and more, to increase awareness also
among the general public and to take steps to eliminate the threats and risks related to the use of
modern information and communication technologies.

The most serious problem in the area of cyber security in the Slovak Republic is the fact that the
protection of cyber space, or the cyber security of the Slovak Republic, is not yet explicitly and
integrally regulated in valid law[16].

Existing capacities and mechanisms in the area of network and information security are no longer
suffi cient to keep the pace with a dynamically changing environment of threats and to provide
a suffi ciently high and, above all, legally effective, level of protection in all areas of the state’s
administration and of social life.

The Slovak Republic, as a member state of NATO and of the EU, also participates in the
formulation of international strategic and conceptual documents, international policies and
standards and must implement the adopted documents[17] and transfer them to national law.
The Slovak Republic is active in international cooperation, with representatives in numerous
international organizations as well as EU and NATO bodies. The Slovak Republic actively pursues
its interests in this area. It regularly participates in cyber trainings (Cyber Coalition, Locked Shields,
Cyber Europe and others), testing the abilities and reactions of the Slovak Republic to cyber
attacks each year. A training entitled “SISE 2010 to 2013” has been coordinated on a national
level. The Slovak Republic closely cooperates, without limitation, with the NATO Cooperative Cyber
Defence Centre of Excellence in Tallinn (NATO CCD COE), the European Network and Information
Security Agency (ENISA) and the recently created European Cybercrime Centre (EC3). In years 2013
– 2014, the National Security Authority has fully accepted the tasks of building NATO cyber defence
and information security in the Slovak Republic within the Forces Targets 2013 defence planning.

**2.4 Purpose of the Concept**

The **_strategic goal of cyber security in the Slovak Republic is to achieve an open, secure, and_**
protected national cyber space, i.e. building trust in the reliability and security of, above all,
critical information and communication infrastructure, as well as building of certainty that this will
perform its functions and serve national interests also in cases of cyber attacks.

Basing on the current situation in cyber security in the Slovak Republic, the goal of the Concept is
to achieve a state where:

     - Protection of national cyber space is a system operating conceptually, in a coordinated
manner, effi ciently, effectively, and on a legal basis.

     - Security awareness of all components of society is systematically increasing.

     - The private and academic sectors as well as civil society actively participate in the
formulation and implementation of the policy of the Slovak Republic in the area
of cyber security.

     - Effi cient collaboration is provided for both at national and international levels.

     - The adopted measures are adequate and respect the protection of privacy and basic human
rights and freedoms.

_16 See the conclusions of the reports on performance of tasks of the Strategy and Action Plan in Annex no. 3 hereto._

_17 These include, without limitation, the NATO Policy on Cyber Defence, 2011; NATO Cyber Defence Action Plan; Enhanced NATO Policy on_
_Cyber Defence, 2014; Cyber security Strategy of the European Union: An Open, Safe and Secure Cyberspace JOIN (2013)._

### 3 Proposed Solution

Basing on the starting points, principles and goals defi ned in the previous chapter of the Concept, the
proposed solution specifi ed in this part defi nes the methods and measures for the Slovak Republic to
achieve the target condition. It defi nes the method and tools to be used by the Slovak Republic to try
to reduce the risks and threats coming from the cyber space, without restricting the benefi ts of the
use thereof. These will further serve as the basis for the Action Plan for Implementation of the Cyber
Security Concept of the Slovak Republic for 2015 – 2020 (hereinafter referred to as the “Action Plan”)
that will defi ne specifi c tasks, including the material, time and fi nancial plan for the implementation
of the Concept.

The Concept considers the following to be the basic implementation tools of the above goal:

- A cyber security control system with a legal basis (institutional, regulatory and methodical
framework), including specialized institutions and
area of terminology.

- High culture of risk control, information exchange between private and public sectors and
increasing capacities of actors.

- Systematic informing and a complex education system in the cyber security area.

- Cooperation and partnerships at national and international levels of all relevant entities from
public, private and academic sectors and
the civil society.

- Development of an internal market with cyber security products and services, especially using
grants, EU funds and support for newly emerging projects or start-ups, as well as support for
research, development and innovation of industrial and technological sources of cyber security.

The Concept proposes to adopt and solve, as priorities, the following seven key measures:

- **Measure 1: Building an institutional framework for cyber security administration.**

- **Measure 2: Creating and adopting a legal framework for cyber security.**

- **Measure 3: Defi ning and applying basic mechanisms for securing the administration**
of cyber space.

- **Measure 4: Supporting, preparing, and introducing a system of education in the area**
of cyber security.

- **Measure 5: Defi ning and applying a risk control culture and a system**
of communication between the stakeholders.

- **Measure 6: Active international collaboration.**

- **Measure 7: Supporting science and research in the area of cyber security.**

_Figure no. 1 Proposed framework structure for managing cyber security_

Cyber security at a national level belongs to the scope of powers of the relevant central state
administration body, with competences and powers defi ned in general by the Competence Act and
specifi cally by a special law (Cyber Security Act). The scope and method of the exercise of public
authority in the area of cyber security by relevant central state administration bodies and other
state bodies in the framework of specifi c material areas of administration of the state’s socioeconomic environment (hereinafter referred to as “material areas”) will be defi ned by a special law
(Cyber Security Act).

Complex provision for cyber security within individual material areas must be performed by the
exercise of public authority and exercise of special activities. The Concept foresees that a National
Incident Resolution Unit and several incident resolution units in material areas of special importance
(hereinafter referred to as the “units”) will be formed. To use human capacities rationally and use
the technological equipment of the unit effi ciently, the Concept foresees the formation of common
units for other material areas; the National Incident Resolution Unit can hold the authority in
certain material areas. The competences and authority of the National Incident Resolution Unit and
of the units will be defi ned by the Cyber Security Act.

The Concept proposes the following framework defi nition of the powers and competences of public
administration bodies in the area of cyber security at a central level:

**Central state administration body for cyber security – the authority of an existing non-sectoral**
central state administration body[18] extended by another segment of state administration. The
Concept recommends that the lawmaker entrusts this authority to the National Security Authority.

_18 I.e. a state body whose powers do not relate to a specifi c material area of administration of the state’s socio-economic environment. E.g.:_
_Offi ce of Government of the SR, National Security Authority._

state administration authority – authority with material relevance of cyber security. The physical
establishment of sectoral units in all sectors of administration is not foreseen. However, the
following functionalities must be implemented in individual sectors of administration.[20]

_20 The conditions of establishing of incident resolution units and the scope of their authority, competences and duties, will be set by the Cyber_
_Security Act._


-----

Competences and responsibilities:

- Systematically monitors the status of security and adherence to security standards of
information systems in its material area,

- Ensures and bears responsibility for the execution of reactions to incidents and/or cyber
attacks in its area of powers,

- Prepares operating procedures for reactions to incidents within its scope of powers and
submits them for approval to the Central state administration authority for cyber security,

- Cooperates with other incident resolution units.

Based on experience from international cooperation, membership in international organizations,
as well as the experience of other countries, the effi cient exercise of measures of cyber security
requires wide-spectre cooperation not only between state administration and territorial selfadministration but also with the academic sector, scientifi c institutions, and of the private
sector. The Concept proposes the formation of a formal platform for collaboration on a national
**level, ensuring the participation of representatives of the corporate and academic sectors in the**
preparation and formulation of government decisions by submitting recommendations and/or
opinions on the development and continuous improvement of the cyber security system of the
Slovak Republic.

**3.2 Creation and Adoption of a Legal Framework for Cyber Security**

At present, the highest priority for a substantial increase in the effi ciency and effectiveness of the
protection of cyber space in the Slovak Republic is the formal legal regulation of the cyber security
**control system. For this purpose, it is necessary to:**

1. Adopt a special Cyber Security Act, that will, without limitation:

     - Formally ensure the coordination of the formation and implementation of a unifi ed state
policy in cyber security,

     - Explicitly establish the material powers and competences of public authorities as well as
the scope and method of exercise of their competences,

     - Explicitly defi ne the powers and competences of other actors, as well as the scope and
method of application thereof,

     - Establish duties for entities using information and communication technologies
in cyber space,

     - Will guarantee the rights, legally protected interests of other legal entities and natural
persons and will defi ne their duties.

2. Establish binding terminology and standards for the area
of cyber security.

3. In individual sectors, issue a methodical guidance for the practical application of the Act and of
standards in the system of the sector’s management and operation.


15

**3.3 Development and Application of Basic Mechanisms Providing for the Administration**
**of Cyber Space**

To ensure specialized tasks in order to render cyber space resistant, the Concept identifi es and
proposes the application and development of the following basic mechanisms:

1. Decision-making and control mechanism – continuous cross-sectoral planning, organizing,
coordination, implementation and control of measures aimed at minimizing cyber security
threats and preventing their growth into crisis situations:

     - Preparing crisis plans for solving crisis situations,

     - Summarizing the needs and requirements necessary to solve identifi ed threats and
confronting them with the possibilities of the state, regions, legal entities and
natural persons,

     - Designating the forces, resources and funds necessary for solving crisis situations.

2. Prevention mechanism – protective measures aimed at acting against crisis situations arising
and to minimize potential risks implied mostly for information and technical means of
communication:

     - National policy of behaviour in cyber space,

     - Specialized training of professionals in the area of information and communication
technical means as well as strengthening the security awareness of inhabitants in the
fi eld of information and communication technologies,

     - Technical/technological support – available for the general public, corresponding to the
required protection levels, including recommendations, measures and technical measures
including adequate software, hardware and regime standards, the settings and
updates thereof,

     - Intelligence activities aimed at the collection, centralisation and evaluation of intelligence
information useful for prevention (e.g. intelligence information about cyber threats),

     - Collaboration with member states of the EU and NATO, the relevant bodies of these
organizations and with partner states in order to continuously monitor, analyse and
evaluate the security situation in cyber space, discover threats of crisis situations early and
coordinate the adoption of preventive measures to eliminate such threats.

3. Reaction mechanism – measures aimed at a qualifi ed and effi cient reaction in the event of
incidents and/or crisis situations that need to be taken in cases of ongoing attacks in order to
fence off or counterwork the attack and prevent the attacker from causing damage:

     - Defensive activities aimed at preventing the attacker from performing and/or continuing
in the cyber attack; this involves the activation of entities active when solving crisis
situations and if necessary, an early warning for the public, taking measures aimed at
stopping the escalation of the crisis situation and the creation of conditions for a return to
a stabilized situation,

     - Offensive activities aimed at weakening and/or eliminating the cyber and even physical
capacities of the attacker and to discourage the attacker from continuing in the attacks,

     - Intelligence activities aimed at supporting defensive and/or offensive activities (e.g.
intelligence information about the cyber capacities of the attacker).

4. Restoration mechanism – rescue measures aimed at reducing the consequences of damage
caused by cyber attacks and return to the original state:

     - Removal of the consequences of the crisis situation and return to a stabilized state,

     - Organizational, personnel, technological and other specifi c measures to avoid the reoccurrence of the crisis situation and/or threat.

The nature of the fi ght against cyber attacks implies the necessity to use all security mechanisms
and tools with effi cient cross-sectoral and international cooperation.

**3.4 Support, Formulation and Implementation of an Education System in the Area of Cyber Security**

The quality, effi ciency and effectiveness of performance of measures and tasks in the area of cyber
security depend substantially on the level of social awareness, education level of society, as well
as of the abilities of the actors in the area. For this purpose, it is necessary to identify specifi c tasks
of the Action Plan for the areas of:

1. Spreading knowledge and raising awareness.

2. General educational system in the Slovak Republic at the levels of:

a. Primary education,

b. Secondary education.

3. Specialized educational system at the levels of:

a. Secondary education,

b. University education,

c. Experts.

**3.5 Determination and Application of Risk Management Culture and Communication System**
**Between Stakeholders**

An effi cient and secure system for on-line communication and the exchange of information between
the entities of the control structure of cyber security as well as with other relevant actors in the
national cyber space, with optimal setting of competences, is necessary to ensure its protection.
This is why it is necessary, at national and sectoral levels and at the levels of key actors from the
private sector:

   - To set up control and executive structures optimally, with clearly defi ned powers
and competences,

   - To prepare and introduce relevant methodologies and standards,

   - To implement relevant supporting information, communication and control systems as well as
secure systems: exchange of information, early warning and coordinated reaction.


17


-----

**3.6 International Cooperation**

Due to its global nature, cyber security requires an intense joint use of information and coordination
of activities both at national and international levels. The Slovak Republic, as a member state of
NATO and the EU, will participate in drawing up international strategic and conceptual documents,
international policies and standards and will, at the same time, build the most effi cient model of
cooperation, exchange and joint use of information between CERT and CSIR-type offi ces. Besides
active international collaboration in international organizations and structures, the Slovak Republic
will also establish and develop bilateral collaboration with nations sharing identical values. The
Slovak Republic will organize and participate in international cyber trainings and exercises.

**3.7 Support of Science and Research in the Area of Cyber Security**

In the framework of cooperation of the public sector with the private sector and the academic
institutions, the Slovak Republic also intends to support the development of cooperation in
research projects (including qualitative and quantitative research). It will support participation in
national as well as European research projects and activities in the area of cyber security, stressing
the use of funds from the Research and Innovations Operating Programme for the 2014 - 2020
programming period. Research activities in the area will be coordinated by the central state
administration authority for cyber security.

The Slovak Republic also intends to support the private sector and academic institutions in the
development and implementation of information and communication technologies aimed at the
protection of cyber space and in the development thereof; stimulation of investments in the area
will be a national priority.

### 4 Conclusions and Recommendations

To protect national cyber space, fulfi l the undertakings of the Slovak Republic as a member state of
the EU and NATO and to fulfi l other international undertakings, on the basis of experience from other
member states, in order to optimize the collaboration between public administration bodies, as well
as between public administration and the private and academic sector and in the interest of removing
duplicities, the Slovak Republic has decided to adopt a conceptual material for the area of cyber security
at a national level in the form of this Concept.

The Concept is the basic and starting document for the subsequent formulation of regulations,
standards, methodology, rules, security policies and other tools necessary to provide cyber security.
Since it is a defi ning element of the security environment of the Slovak Republic and a subsystem of
national security, it is necessary to evaluate and build it up continuously. The Slovak Republic perceives
the area of cyber security as an important part of the everyday use of information and communication
technologies; this is why it will stress the execution of measures aimed at securing it.

The Slovak Republic will regularly evaluate and assess international law, international treaties,
as well as trends and standards in the fi eld of cyber security and will implement these and apply
them when adopting legislation in the area of cyber security. The Slovak Republic intends to actively
participate in the preparation of law, standards and norms in the institutions of the EU, NATO and other
international organizations.

On the basis of the adopted proposals of the Concept, it is recommended to prepare and submit to the
sessions of the Security Council of the Slovak Republic and of the Government of the Slovak Republic:

1. **A draft Cyber Security Act that will integrally cover the area of cyber security.**

2. A Proposal of an Action Plan for the Implementation of the Cyber Security Concept of the
**Slovak Republic for 2015 – 2020 that will determine a material, time and fi nancial plan**
for the implementation of the Concept. This document will include a material, time and
fi nancial plan of tasks for the individual central state administration bodies in the scope of
their powers and competences within the basic security areas of operation of the state. The
implementation of these tasks will serve to achieve the fulfi lment of measures of the Concept
in the application of basic principles of cyber security. A framework proposal of tasks is
included in Annex no. 4 to the Concept.

In order to defi ne, stabilize and use unifi ed terminology related to cyber security, it is
recommended to:

3. Discuss the terminology used in the Concept in the Cross-sectoral Terminological Commission
of the Security Council of the Slovak Republic and subsequently to publish it in the
Terminological Dictionary of Crisis Management.

For non-confi dential facts, similarly to the defi nitions in regulations for confi dential facts, it is
recommended to establish formally, in an adequate scope:

4. Requirements for physical, building, personnel and information security, as well as conditions
**of security of technical and system resources and cipher protection of information.**

In order to create conditions for systematic collaboration between the public administration,
academic institutions, scientifi c sector and the private sector on ensuring cyber security in the
Slovak Republic, it is recommended to create, at a national level:

5. **A formal cooperation platform.**

**Interpretation of Key Terms for the Purposes of the Concept**

_Cyber Security in General is the ability of any electronic communications network, electronic information_
and/or control system to resist, at a certain reliability level, random events and/or damaging activities
that may negatively infl uence the integrity, faithfulness, confi dentiality and availability of the stored,
processed and/or transmitted data and/or services provided by the network or by an information or
control system and thereby to disrupt and/or negatively infl uence the operability of, without limitation,
one of the sectors of critical infrastructure[27] and/or one of the basic security areas of operation
of the state.

_Cyber Security from a Process Viewpoint, at a state level, is the system of continuous and planned increase_
in political, legal, economic, security, defence and educational awareness that includes increasing the
effi ciency of the adopted and applied technical and organizational measures of risk management in
cyber space in order to transform it into a trustworthy environment that will provide for safe operation
of social and economic processes while ensuring an acceptable level of risks in cyber space[28].

_Cyber space is a virtual space without borders, seen as a global interactive domain in an information_
environment that is characterised by the use of the electronic and electromagnetic spectre for the
creation, storage, modifi cation and exchange of data and use of services. Cyber space also means a
combined phenomenon of global connection, de-centralized and continuously growing electronic
information, communication and control systems, as well of the interconnection of social and economic
processes in the form of data and information using these systems, including the data stored and/or
processed therein.

_National Cyber Space of the Slovak Republic includes the parts of the above systems of cyber space that_
are located in the territory of the Slovak Republic as well as other systems of cyber space that contain
data and information aimed at the Slovak Republic and/or infl uencing the Slovak Republic[29].

_Information Environment means a set of individuals, organizations and systems that collect, process,_
spread, or work with information irrespective of whether the information is in physical form, in audio
form, or in electronic form.

_Information Security means: a set and application of security measures and procedures[30] serving in_
the framework of a specifi c information environment, to protect information from impairment/loss,
or compromising (loss of confi dentiality, integrity and other characteristics such as authenticity,
trustworthiness, non-deniability and reliability) and to preserve the availability of information and the
ability to work therewith in the scope of assigned authorizations.

_27 Act no. 45/2011 Coll. on Critical Infrastructure as amended, states in Art.2(c) that “critical infrastructure” is a system divided into sectors_
_and elements. The meaning of these components is defi ned in Art. 2(a) and 2(b) of the same Act._

_28 The term cyber security should also be understood as dedicated mechanisms, defi ned policies, as well as processes tasked to protect_
_systems and data from cyber threats and/or attacks._

_29 The defi nition of the contents of this term is of substantial importance from the formal law aspect as the jurisdiction of the Slovak Republic_
_cannot be applied in the framework of cross-border, i.e. global cyber space, it must be limited to a part thereof, i.e. to the National_
_Cyber Space._

### Annex no. 3: Conclusions of Reports on the Performance of Tasks of the National Information Security Strategy in the Slovak Republic and tasks of the Action Plan for 2008 to 2013

**2009 Report**

Contains no conclusion. The end of the Report contains the “Proposal of performance of tasks for 2009”

**2010 Report**

By comparing the results of monitoring to the results of inspections it can be stated that identical
problematic areas and critical factors have been identifi ed. The process of information security
management has systematic defi ciencies in the area of the preparation of crisis plans, the transfer
of competences and crisis management. To remove defi ciencies more effi ciently, it is necessary to
speed up the introduction of systematic education in the area at all levels and apply a sanction
mechanism for violations of Act no. 275/2006 Coll. on Public Administration Information Systems
and on the modifi cation and amendment of other acts as amended thoroughly, including its
implementing regulations.

**2011 Report**

The main task in the area of IB is to create a single platform for building an information society, built
on a legal basis, providing adequate protection and trustworthiness to the digital space of Slovakia.

To reach and maintain the required condition of IB, it is necessary to solve, in 2011, the priority tasks,
especially in the area of law, knowledge standards for IB and the coordination of exercises for cases of
reaction and restoration after security incidents at a national level and related activities.

**2012 Report**

The main task in the area of IB is to create a unifi ed platform of building IB, based on a legal basis,
providing adequate protection and trustworthiness to the digital space of the Slovak Republic. To
reach and maintain the required condition of IB it is necessary, during the coming period, to solve the
priority tasks especially in the area of law, knowledge standards for IB and coordination and exercises
for cases of reaction and restoration after security incidents at national and international level
and related activities.

**2013 Report**

The main task in the area of IB is to create a unifi ed platform of building IB, based on a legal basis,
providing adequate protection and trustworthiness to the digital space of the Slovak Republic. To reach
and maintain the required condition of IB it is necessary, during the coming period, to solve the priority
tasks especially in the area of law, knowledge standards for IB and coordination and exercises for
cases of reaction and restoration after security incidents at national and international level and related
activities. These activities are fully harmonized with the goals of the proposal for “Directive concerning
measures to ensure a high common level of network and information security in the Union”; it will be
necessary to create a legal base for the missing competences and duties of the already formed “CSIRT.
SK” unit; this is a task for the Ministry of Finance of the Slovak Republic. The purpose is to bring the
unit at least to the level of similar units in developed EU member states. The transposal of the directive
in the territory of the Slovak Republic will be performed in the prepared Information Security Act that
will also require amending other related generally binding regulations.

**2014 Report**

When comparing the status for the period of 2013 to the previous period, one can state that minor
improvements in several areas compared to the previous period fail to refl ect the possibilities for
improvement. Despite improvements in certain areas, stagnation and/or worsening of situation was
seen in most areas. This negative phenomenon can be explained by failure to adhere to the existing
regulatory framework, lack of qualifi ed staff and generally the low security awareness of entities active
in the area of IB in public administration.

Improvement of the situation in the fi eld can be expected after the introduction of legal and
organizational measures, standardized procedures and control mechanisms. This applies, above all,
to the introduction of mandatory classifi cation of information and information systems of public
administration and the subsequent introduction of minimum security measures for their protection, also
defi ning legal responsibility for the suppliers of these services. Another condition for the improvement
of the overall situation is the introduction of the process of IB management in organizations, risk
management and without doubt, an increase in security awareness and skills of personnel. Preparing
the environment for the introduction of the required measures will require legal changes that were
defi ned in the legal intention of the Information Security Act approved by the Government; its intention
will also be refl ected in the prepared Information Security Act.
