Minister of Defense
KISHI Nobuo

In the year 2020, not only did the entire world face unprecedented difficulties due to COVID-19,

but various security challenges and destabilizing factors became more tangible and acute, and the

international order based on universal values, which has underpinned the peace and prosperity of the

international community, has been greatly tested.

Looking at the situation around Japan, China has continued its unilateral attempts to change the status

quo in the East and South China Seas. China Coast Guard (CCG) vessels are sighted almost daily in

the contiguous zone surrounding the Senkaku Islands, an inherent part of the territory of Japan, and

repeatedly intrude into Japan’s territorial waters. Furthermore, there have also been incidents of CCG

vessels approaching Japanese fishing boats while intruding into Japanese territorial waters, further

making the situation serious. Against this backdrop, China entered into force the China Coast Guard

Law in February 2021. The CCG Law includes problematic provisions in terms of their inconsistency

with international law. Sources of inconsistency include, among others, ambiguity as to geographical

areas the CCG Law applies and how the rules governing the use of weapons are implemented. The CCG

Law must not be allowed to infringe on the legitimate interests of the relevant countries including Japan.

Furthermore, the raising of tensions in the East China Sea and other sea areas is completely unacceptable.

In addition, North Korea is proceeding with ballistic missile development at an extremely rapid

pace. It launched ballistic missiles of a new type in 2021, and such military trends, including nuclear

and missile development, pose grave and imminent threats to Japan’s security.

The Indo-Pacific region is the core of the world’s vitality, and at the same time, it faces various

security challenges. In the midst of the changing global power balance, the importance of the region

is further increasing. In order to counter these challenges in the security environment, it is essential

not only to strengthen Japan’s own defense capabilities and expand the roles we can fulfill, but also

to closely cooperate with countries that share the same fundamental values.

In particular, cooperation with the United States, our only ally, is of paramount importance.

Since the new U.S. administration took office, I have continued to pursue close bilateral cooperation

through a defense ministerial meeting, the Japan-U.S. “2+2” meeting, and other opportunities.

I also believe that the fact that the Japan-U.S. Summit Meeting was held as the first face-to-face

meeting with foreign leader since the President Biden’s inauguration testifies that the United States

also attaches great importance to the Japan-U.S. Alliance. The Alliance is the cornerstone of peace,

security, and prosperity in the region, and we will strive to further strengthen its deterrence and

response capabilities in order to further solidify the unshakable bond of the Japan-U.S. Alliance.

Furthermore, Japan is promoting the “Free and Open Indo-Pacific” (FOIP) vision, based on the

concept that achieving a free and open rules-based order will enhance peace and prosperity across

the entire region and throughout the world. The MOD/SDF will further contribute to the peace and

stability of the region and the international community through active cooperation with countries

that share Japan’s vision of the FOIP, including not only the United States as our ally, but also

Australia, India, European countries including the United Kingdom, France, and Germany, as well

as Canada and New Zealand.

With every step taken along the path of a peace-loving nation, Japan has become a country that

proudly flies the flag of universal values, such as freedom, democracy, the rule of law, and respect

for fundamental human rights. As the flag bearer of universal values in the Indo-Pacific region,

joining hands with like-minded partners, we must cherish freedom, have faith in democracy, be

deeply resentful at the failure to protect human rights, and resolutely oppose to any attempt to

change the order by coercion. SDF personnel perform their demanding duties every day with this

determination to protect the nation of Japan, including these values that have taken root deep in the

hearts and minds of our people.

This white paper firmly demonstrates to readers not only at home, but also abroad that the MOD/

SDF have unwavering will and ability to defend Japan even in the midst of a drastically changing

security environment, alongside showing the high level of transparency regarding the activities and

efforts of the MOD/SDF.

The MOD/SDF will diligently engage in our duties on the front lines of national defense at all

times, boldly fulfilling our responsibilities to safeguard lives and peaceful livelihoods of our people,

and the integrity of our territory, waters, and airspace, and will do our utmost to ensure the peace,

stability, and prosperity of the region and the international community.

(Coast Guard Law), which stipulates the responsibility of the
Coast Guard and its the Coast Guard’s responsibilities and
authority including the use of weapons, was newly enacted
in January 2021 and entered into force in February 2021.
The Coast Guard Law includes problematic provisions in
terms of their inconsistency with international law. Sources
of inconsistency include, among others, ambiguity as to
geographical areas the Coast Guard Law applies and how
the rules governing the use of weapons are implemented.
The Coast Guard Law must not be allowed to infringe on
the legitimate interests of the relevant countries including
Japan. Furthermore, the raising of tensions in the East

In 2015, the Bureau of Operational Policy was abolished
and the functions of the Joint Staff were strengthened
in order to centralize the operations of the SDF. In 2018,
the Ground Component Command was newly formed to
assume unified command over GSDF troops.

the development of anti-satellite weapons. Thus,
securing the stable use of space has become an
important issue.

**The Importance of the Cyber Domain**

Information and communications networks
form a foundation for the SDF’s activities in
various domains, and any attack against them
would seriously disrupt the organized activities
of the SDF. Cyber attacks are recognized as
an asymmetric means of attack to impede the
activities of adversaries at a low cost. It has been
pointed out that militaries of various countries
are trying to acquire the capability to neutralize
command and control and communication
functions by infiltrating networks and systems
and embedding malware. There are also
concerns that cyber attacks could lead to
information theft and increased vulnerability of
critical infrastructure and other assets. Stable
use of the cyber domain is essential for the
activities of the SDF and, by extension, for the
security of Japan and its people.

In recent years, militaries are becoming increasingly dependent on the electromagnetic spectrum due to the proliferation
of telecommunication equipment, modernization of equipment, and technological advances. For example, technologies
such as the networking of equipment and swarms of small unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) make the use of the
electromagnetic spectrum essentials.
As a result, technologies to disrupt adversaries’ use of the electromagnetic spectrum are also advancing, and there are
reports of cases in other countries of interference with radio communications as well as interference with positioning
signals to disrupt the activities of the UAVs. In this way, the electromagnetic spectrum is at the forefront of offense and

**Current Trends in Security Environment**

-  Uncertainty over the existing order is increasing, and inter-state competition is becoming prominent across the political, economic and military realms.

-  Complex measures required due to “hybrid warfare”

-  Prolonged gray-zone situations

-  Technological progress exerting significant influence on security

-  Importance of space, cyberspace, and electromagnetic spectrum domains

-  Game-changing technologies that could drastically change the conduct of future warfare (artificial intelligence (AI), hypersonic, and high-power energy
technologies, etc.)

-  Emergence of security challenges, which cannot be dealt with by a single country alone

-  Need to secure stable use of new domains including space and cyberspace; need to ensure security of maritime traffic; response to proliferation of weapons of
mass destruction (WMDs); and response to international terrorism

-  In relation to the COVID-19 pandemic, it has been pointed out that there have been moves by some countries with the intent to create international and regional orders
more preferable to themselves and to expand their influence. There is a need to continue to monitor such moves as security issues with great concern.

**Security Environment Surrounding Japan**

-  Military powers with high quality and quantity are concentrated in Japan’s surroundings, where clear trends such as further military buildup and an increase in
military activities are observed.

-  A regional cooperation framework in the security realm has not been sufficiently institutionalized in the Indo-Pacific region and longstanding issues of territorial rights
and reunification continue to remain.

-  Recent years have seen a continued tendency towards the prolongation of “gray zone” situations that are associated with territories, sovereignty and economic
interests, and such situations may increase and expand in the future.

**Inauguration of the Biden Administration**

-  The Biden administration was inaugurated in January 2021. Following on from the previous Trump administration, the Biden administration continues to focus on
initiatives based on a tough stance towards China. At the same time, with the administration having set out a clear foreign policy direction based on international
cooperation, attention should be paid to developments related to an overall review of U.S. security policy, which will be conducted with a focus on consultations with
U.S. allies and partners.

-  Based on the “America First” policy and the realist concept that power plays a central role, the Trump administration has significantly changed the patterns of U.S.
involvement in the world. The administration set out a clear stance of emphasizing strategic competition with China, in particular, and also with Russia.

**Security Policy under the Biden Administration**

-  President Biden expressed the basic stance that the United States will reengage itself in the world
again by repairing its alliances, and lead the world not merely through demonstration of power,
but with credibility and moral authority.

-  President Biden also expressed his recognition that the United States would have to respond to a
new era characterized by growing authoritarianism by countries such as China and Russia, and
global issues such as the spread of infectious diseases, climate change, and nuclear proliferation.

-  The Biden administration clarified its intent to conduct a global posture review of the U.S. forces, and
announced that the United States would counter China over the long term, which the administration
considers the only competitor potentially capable of sustainably challenging the international system,
putting the highest priority on the military presence in the Indo-Pacific region.

**Engagement in the Indo-Pacific Region, etc.**

-  The Trump administration rejected China’s attempt to impose the idea that “might is
right” in the South China Sea and other waters, and deployed two Carrier Strike Groups
in the South China Sea for the first time in six years to carry out naval exercises,
while also indicating that the United States was reinforcing the implementation of the
Freedom of Navigation Operations. President Biden reaffirmed that maintaining a “free
and open Indo-Pacific” is a U.S. priority, and announced that the U.S. stance on this
remains unchanged.

-  The Biden administration emphasizes the importance of technology in defense policy,
such as utilizing emerging technologies and dealing with the associated risks, and
enhancing capabilities in cyberspace. The administration also expressed the view
that technological competition will become one of the central issues in the strategic
competition with China.

**and China, etc.**

**U.S.-China Relationship**

-  In recent years, competition between the United States and China is becoming more prominent across the political, economic and military realms, with both countries
making moves to keep each other in check. In particular, competition in technological fields is likely to become even more intense.

-  As China rapidly enhances its military power, changes in the military power balance between the United States and China may possibly affect the peace and stability
of the Indo-Pacific region. It is necessary to pay greater attention to the military trends of the two countries in areas such as the South China Sea and Taiwan.

-  In the South China Sea, China is expanding its military activities, including ballistic missile launches and military exercises involving aircraft carriers. Meanwhile,
in July 2020, the United States criticized China’s claims of maritime interests as being illegal, and toughened its stance against China further by implementing
Freedom of Navigation Operations and military exercises involving aircraft carriers.

-  At a US Senate hearing, the Commander of the US Indo-Pacific Command indicated that the military balance in the Indo-Pacific is becoming more unfavorable for
the United States and its allies and that they are accumulating risk that may embolden China to unilaterally change the status quo. Furthermore, he testified that
China’s ambitions towards Taiwan will manifest itself in the next six years.

**Taiwan**

-  China has further intensified military activities around Taiwan including Chinese aircrafts’ entering the southwestern airspace of Taiwan. In the meantime, the United
States has demonstrated a clear stance of supporting Taiwan in military aspects, such as transits by U.S. vessels through the Taiwan Strait and weapon sales.
Stabilizing the situation surrounding Taiwan is important for Japan’s security and the stability of the international community. Therefore, it is necessary that we pay
close attention to the situation with a sense of crisis more than ever before.

-  The overall military balance between China and Taiwan is tilting to China’s favor, and the gap appears to be growing year by year. Attention should be paid to
trends such as the strengthening of Chinese and Taiwanese forces, the sale of weapons to Taiwan by the United States, and Taiwan’s own development of its
main military equipment.

Chapter 2

**North Korea**

**Overview**

-  Military trends in North Korea pose grave and imminent threats to Japan’s security.

-  North Korea has conducted six nuclear tests in the past and is proceeding with ballistic missile
development at an extremely rapid pace. It is believed that North Korea already has the ability to
attack Japan with nuclear weapons fitted to ballistic missiles, within whose range Japan lies.

-  North Korea has developed more advanced missile-related technologies in recent years, trying
to breach missile defense networks by developing ballistic missiles that use solid fuel and fly at A possible new ICBM-class ballistic missile that appeared at a military parade
lower altitudes than conventional ballistic missiles on irregular trajectories. There are concerns (October 2020) [EPA/Jiji]
that such advanced technologies will be applied to longer-range missiles.

-  North Korea is relentlessly pursuing increasingly complex and diverse modes of attack and
is steadily strengthening and improving its attack capabilities. These enhancements in its
capabilities make early detection of the signs of a launch and the interception of the missiles
more difficult, thereby posing new challenges for the information gathering, early warning, and
interception postures of relevant countries, including Japan.

-  In March 2021, North Korea launched new types of ballistic missiles.

**Future Trends Regarding Weapon Development**

-  At the 8th Congress of the Korean Workers’ Party (KWP) in January 2021, North Korea made specific remarks on the development
of various weapons such as multi-warhead technology, “hypersonic gliding flight warheads,” nuclear-powered submarines,
and solid fuel-propelled ICBMs, thereby announcing the stance that it is reinforcing its military capabilities.

-  North Korean military parades in October 2020 and January 2021 showcased a possible new ICBM-class ballistic missile
that appeared at a military parade, a possible new SLBM that appeared at a military parade referred to as Pukguksong-4 and
Pukguksong-5, and a new type of ballistic missile (launched in March 2021).

**Russia**

**Overview**

-  Russia is modernizing its military equipment, including strategic nuclear forces, and is gradually
enhancing the deployment capability of its military forces in remote areas by securing military
bases outside Russia.

-  Russia is promoting the development of hypersonic weapons and other new types of weapons,
while also intensifying activities in new domains such as space and electromagnetic spectrum.

**Activities in Japan’s Northern Territories and the Vicinity of Japan**

-  In addition to a trend of increasing activity by Russian armed forces in the vicinity of Japan, Russia has also
shown a recent tendency to deploy the latest equipment in the Far East region.

-  In the strategic nuclear forces exercises conducted in December 2020, a Borey-class SSBN deployed in and
around the Sea of Okhotsk fired a new SLBM for the first time.

-  In December 2020, the Ministry of Defence of Russia announced the full deployment of the S-300V4 surface-
to-air missile system in Etorofu and Kunashiri Islands.

China-Russia joint flight is the second such incident following one in July 2019.

East China Sea

-  In response to a question regarding the Chinese-Russian military alliance, President Putin
remarked, “Theoretically, it is possible to envisage a military alliance.”

-  In December 2020, the Chinese and Russian Ministers of Defense agreed to extend the bilateral
cooperation agreement on the launch notification for ballistic missiles and other missiles for
10 years.

**Challenges Facing the International Community**

**Military Science and Technology**

-  Major countries are focusing on the development of advanced
technologies that can be game-changing technologies and drastically
change the future of warfare (artificial intelligence (AI), hypersonic, and
high-power energy technologies, etc.). Some advanced technologies
in the civilian sector have been transferred to military technologies.

-  As it is being pointed out that China has attempted to obtain advanced
technologies from other countries, protection of technologies is also
an important issue.

**Space Domain**

-  In outer space, various countries are rapidly developing capabilities to ensure their military
superiority, such as reconnaissance, communication, and positioning satellites. On the other hand,
these countries are also emphasizing the development of their capabilities to impede each other’s
use of outer space. Recent major trends among the major countries are as follows.

-  United States: In the Defense Space Strategy, the United States assessed that China and Russia
present the most immediate and serious threat to the country. The United States is also advancing
plans for a satellite mega-constellation.

-  China: China has actively advanced space development including launching a Mars probe,
developing a communication satellite constellation plan, and launching a rocket from a ship
on the Yellow Sea. China has completed the launch of all satellites that constitute the BeiDou
Navigation Satellite System.

-  Russia: Russia has increased its space activities, including conducting two launch tests of a
ground-launched anti-satellite missile (U.S. announcement).

**Cyber Domain**

-  It is pointed out that China, Russia, and North Korea have been conducting increasingly diverse and aggressive cyber attacks. Recent major cyber attacks are as follows.

-  China: An actor with ties to China’s Ministry of National Security conducted cyber attacks on private-sector companies that were involved in the development of
the COVID-19 vaccine (announced by the United States, July 2020).
Cyber attacks that are highly likely to have the involvement of the Chinese People’s Liberation Army’s units against approximately 200 domestically based
Japanese companies and other entities (announced by Japan, April 2021)

-  Russia: The Main Intelligence Directorate of the General Staff of the Russian Armed Forces (GRU) was responsible for the cyber attack on the electricity grid in
Ukraine and the cyber activities targeting the PyeongChang Olympics (announced by the United States, October 2020)
Russia conducted cyber reconnaissance on organizations related to the Tokyo Olympic Games (announced by the United Kingdom, October 2020)
Russia’s Foreign Intelligence Service (SVR) was responsible for cyber attacks targeting U.S. government agencies (announced by the United States, April 2021)

-  North Korea: Cyber attacks by North Korean Army’s Reconnaissance Bureau (announced by the United States, February 2021)

**Electromagnetic Domain**

-  Major countries are also developing equipment for severe electronic warfare environments and conducting electronic warfare-oriented exercises.

**Climate Change**

-  Recognizing climate change as a security issue is shared among countries (risk of inducing and/or exacerbating conflicts over land and resources, risk of inducing
social and political tensions and conflicts due to large-scale migration).

-  It was pointed out that the impacts of climate change can undermine the stability of vulnerable nations. In addition to the increasing need for international assistance,
including military operations, there are also moves by countries to strengthen their military posture in the Arctic areas. In terms of the direct impact on militaries,
various possibilities were pointed out including increased deployment opportunities for rescue operations, increased burdens on equipment and bases, and growing
demands to implement environmental measures.

and enhance initiatives under the new action plan by incorporating thorough management of
work hours and management reforms for improving administrative staff’s management ability.

**Reform to Promote Women’s Participation** Ministry of Defense,” which honors initiatives conducted by each organization in the The annual “Competition for Initiatives to Promote Working Style Reform at the

MOD/SDF that promoted business efficiency

-  In terms of employing and promoting female SDF personnel, the MOD/SDF sets out a personnel
management policy to ensure equal opportunity between men and women and assign the
right person to the right place based on the person’s motivation and ability/aptitude.

-  The MOD/SDF has been reviewing the restriction of assignment of female personnel. With first
female personnel assigned to be a submarine crew member in October 2020, the restriction
against females was completely removed with the exception of the units where female
personnel cannot be assigned for reasons of maternity protection (a part of the GSDF Nuclear
Biological Chemical (NBC) Weapon Defense Unit [chemical] and Tunnel Company Units).

**Enhancement of Medical Functions**

-  For the SDF to perform its mission, the SDF makes continuous efforts to appropriately manage
the health of its personnel and ensure they remain in good health, as well as to enhance
and strengthen its capabilities in military medicine for maximally protecting the lives of the
personnel who engage in a variety of services.

-  Under the circumstances where the SDF’s missions are becoming more diverse and
internationalized, the SDF aims to appropriately and accurately carry out various medical
activities, such as medical support in disaster relief and international peacekeeping activities,
and capacity building in the medical field.

-  As part of the MOD/SDF’s response to the COVID-19 outbreak, the SDF hospitals and the
National Defense Medical College Hospital (NDMCH) have been accepting COVID-19 patients
since February 2020. As of March 31, 2021, the SDF Central Hospital, the SDF hospitals in
Sapporo, Misawa, Sendai, Yokosuka, Fuji, Hanshin, Fukuoka, Sasebo, Kumamoto, Beppu, and

**Reinforcing Technology Base**

-  Review of the Medium- to Long-Term Defense Technology Outlook is now underway in order to ensure Japan’s technological superiority in the strategically important
equipment and technology field, including technologies pertaining to new domains and other potentially game-changing important technologies.

-  In FY2021, the MOD established the Future Capabilities Development Center at the Acquisition, Technology & Logistics Agency in order to reinforce the research
and development system for advanced technology. In addition, the Director for Advanced Technology Strategy, who engages in planning for research and analysis of
advanced technology trends in Japan and overseas, and the Technology Collaboration Support Division, which promotes the application of technical outcomes from
advanced research conducted by universities, private companies, and national research institutes, have been established.

**Optimizing Equipment Procurement**

-  As of the end of March 2021, the MOD has been promoting effective and efficient equipment acquisition by selecting 21 items for major programs designated for
project management. At the same time, the MOD strives to cut equipment procurement costs by making bulk orders utilizing long-term contracts.

-  To enhance the level of performance management, the MOD makes every effort. The specific efforts include constant monitoring of goods and service deliveries
from both sides, facilitating the internal management system concerning the execution process of FMS procurement, and strengthening cooperation with the U.S.
government through close Japan-U.S. consultations.

**Strengthening Defense Industrial Base**

-  In order to strengthen Japan’s defense industrial base, the MOD identifies four lines of effort:
(1) reforming the existing contract system towards creating a competitive environment among
defense companies; (2) strengthening the risk management of the defense equipment supply
chain; (3) further participation of Japan’s defense industry in sustainment and maintenance
of imported equipment, etc.; and (4) promoting appropriate overseas transfer of defense
equipment under the Three Principles on Transfer of Defense Equipment and Technology.

between the Acquisition, Technology & Logistics Agency and the Keidanren
(Japan Business Federation) Committee on Defense Industry (December 2020)

**Defense Equipment and Technology Cooperation**

-  Based on the Three Principles on Transfer of Defense Equipment and Technology, Japan promotes cooperation in defense equipment and technology with other
countries in order to contribute to the maintenance and strengthening of defense technological and industrial bases, as well as contributing to the promotion of our
national security, peace and international cooperation.

-  In August 2020, the contract between the Department of National Defense, the Republic of the Philippines and Mitsubishi
Electric Corporation (MELCO) was concluded to supply four MELCO manufactured air surveillance radar systems with a
total value of approximately one hundred million U.S. dollars (USD 100,000,000). This is the first overseas transfer case
of a complete defense equipment system newly manufactured by a Japanese company since the formulation of the Three
Principles on Transfer of Defense Equipment and Technology in 2014.

-  As opportunities to improve public and private knowledge on the overseas transfer of
defense equipment, the MOD has held webinars one after another on precedents in the
private business sector and the current status of defense equipment and technology
cooperation. (So far, this webinar has been held for India in December 2020 and
Vietnam in March 2021.)

-  In cooperation with trading companies, and manufacturing companies, the MOD has
conducted Feasibility Studies to grasp the potential needs of target countries and
carry out activities for proposals since fiscal year 2020 (conducted for India, Indonesia, Vietnam webinar on the overseas transfer The Philippine Air Force visiting

**Enhancing Intelligence Capabilities**

-  For formulating defense policy accurately in response to the changes in the situation and for
operating defense capabilities effectively in dealing with various situations, it is necessary
to grasp medium- to long-term military trends in the neighboring countries of Japan and
to detect the indications of various situations promptly. To this end, the MOD/SDF is making
efforts to collect information swiftly and accurately daily by using various methods.

-  Examples of intelligence collection means used by the MOD/SDF include: (1) collecting,
processing and analyzing military communications and signals emanating from electronic
weapons in the air over Japan; (2) collecting, processing, and analyzing data from various
imagery satellites (including Information Gathering Satellite); (3) surveillance activities by
ships, aircraft and other assets; (4) collecting and organizing a variety of open source
information; (5) information exchanges with defense organizations of other nations; and
(6) intelligence collection conducted by defense attachés and other officials. Defense Attaché to Israel Colonel Hiramitsu (right end) participating in an online

cooperation with the Oceania region and improve intelligence collection related to Europe
and the Middle East.

**SDF Training and Exercises for Maintaining**

Chapter 4

**and Further Enhancing High-Level Skills**

**Training and Exercises by Each SDF Service**

**Training and Exercises**

To fulfill its mission of defending Japan, the SDF needs to ensure that commanders and personnel possess high-
level credentials and abilities even under normal circumstances, and that its units maintain high-level skills, so that
the SDF can adopt a robust defense posture. This work will serve as deterrence to discourage other countries from
having any intention to invade Japan. The SDF strengthens the Japan-U.S. Alliance capabilities to deter and respond
by steadily implementing bilateral training and exercises. In addition, the SDF raises its presence from peacetime
and demonstrates the intention and capabilities of Japan by actively conducting and joining multilateral training and
exercises, based on the vision of the Free and Open Indo-Pacific (FOIP).

**Major Bilateral/Multilateral Training and Exercises of SDF Service** U.S. marine and GSDF personnel carry out training at a remote island as part of “Keen Sword

(field training exercise)” (October 2020)

-  The SDF conducts various training and exercises such as the Japan-U.S. bilateral joint exercise “Keen Sword
(field training exercise)” to enhance response capabilities for a range of contingencies and bolster the ability of
the Japan-U.S. Alliance to deter and respond.

-  The MOD/SDF actively carries out training and exercises with relevant countries such as the Japan-U.S.-India-Australia Multilateral Exercise “Malabar 2020” to
contribute to upholding and reinforcing a “Free and Open Indo-Pacific.”

**Development of an Environment for Various Training and Exercises**

SDF training is planned and conducted under conditions as close as possible to actual combat situations. However, it is necessary to further expand and enhance the
training environment to maintain and improve the readiness of the SDF. Against this background, the MOD promotes initiatives to expand and enhance the foundation
for training both in Japan and abroad with the aim of conducting efficient and effective training and exercises.

**Addressing Environmental Issues**

With the Government as a whole promoting concrete measures towards accelerating initiatives related to the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) and realizing a
decarbonized society by 2050, the MOD, as part of the Government, also needs to contribute to solving environmental problems, while at the same time implementing
measures with more focus on the coexistence of SDF/US Forces facilities and areas with surrounding areas.
Specifically, the MOD established the MOD Climate Change Task Force, which strongly promotes measures against global warming ministry-wide, in May 2021. In
addition to which the MOD will reorganize the Bureau of Local Cooperation in FY2021 in order to develop the organization so as to be able to centrally and effectively
respond to environmental issues.

**Public Relations Activities, Public Records and Archives Management, Information Disclosure, and Related Activities**

**Various Public Relations Activities**

-  Providing Information Both Domestically and Internationally

The MOD/SDF conducts active PR activities through official websites, social media (Social
Networking Services) and video distribution, utilizing the Internet.

The MOD has also been making efforts to provide accurate information in a more extensive and
timely fashion, by creating brochures and PR videos, as well as providing assistance in editing the
PR magazine “MAMOR” and cooperation on media coverage.

**Initiatives for Public Document Management and**
**Information Disclosure** Air review (November 2020)

**Key Words** **“Gray-Zone Situations” and “Hybrid Warfare”**

The so-called gray-zone situations simply represent a wide range of situations that are neither peacetime nor wartime.
In a gray-zone situation, for example, a country that confronts another over territory, sovereignty or maritime and other economic interests uses some forceful
organization to demonstrate its presence in the relevant disputed region in a bid to alter the status quo or force other countries to accept its assertions or demands.
The so-called hybrid warfare represents methods to alter the status quo while intentionally blurring the boundaries between the military and non-military realms,
forcing affected actors to take complex measures that are not limited to military actions.
The means of hybrid warfare include operations using military units of unidentified nationality, cyber attacks to affect communications and other critical infrastructure,
the spread of false information through the internet and the media, and other influential operations. The combination of these measures is considered as amounting to
hybrid warfare. In hybrid warfare, a country takes measures that are difficult to identify definitively as an “armed attack” based on its outward appearance. It is said
that such an approach is taken with an intent to make it difficult for the target country to address the situation, such as delaying the military’s initial response, while
denying the attacker country’s own involvement.
Amid emerging inter-state competition, hybrid warfare and other various measures tend to cause gray-zone situations to last for a long period of time.

certain norms of behavior.
In the maritime domain, there have been cases where
a country unilaterally claims its entitlement and takes
actions based on its own assertions that are incompatible
with the existing international order, thereby unduly
infringing upon the freedom of navigation in high seas
and of overflight. In addition, piracy acts have taken
place in various parts of the world.
The proliferation of weapons of mass destruction
(WMDs), such as nuclear, biological, and chemical
(NBC) weapons, and of ballistic missiles that serve
as the means of delivery of WMDs, and international
terrorism are still viewed as significant threats to the
international community.
In response to the COVID-19 infection that emerged
in China since the end of 2019, respective countries
have been utilizing their military forces’ sanitary
capabilities, transportation capacity, and facilities, along
with medical organizations, to deal with the infection
domestically since the beginning of the outbreak. In the
meantime, positive COVID-19 cases were identified
within the military forces of those countries, leading
to the situation in which military training or bilateral/
multilateral exercises became suspended or postponed,
and the infection has brought about diverse impacts
and restrictions to military activities. Afterwards, as

such as further military buildup and an increase in
military activities are observed.
States in the Indo-Pacific region, including Japan,
abound in political, economic, ethnic, and religious
diversity. Also, each country has different security views
and threats perceptions. Therefore, a regional cooperation
framework in the security realm has not been sufficiently
institutionalized, and longstanding issues of territorial
rights and reunification in this region continue to remain.

the development of COVID-19 vaccines progresses, in
the United States and other countries, there were cases
in which military forces were mobilized to support
operations related to COVID-19 vaccines.
Regarding the COVID-19 pandemic, it is pointed
out that there have been moves of some countries
intending to create international and regional orders
more preferable to themselves and to expand their
influence, such as spreading disinformation and other
propaganda efforts in various manners and conducting
so-called “vaccine diplomacy.” For example, it has been
pointed out that Russia and China’s so-called “vaccine
diplomacy,” involving the continued active promotion
of domestically developed vaccines around the world,
is linked to disinformation and falsification activities
aimed at damaging the trust placed in vaccines made
by Europe, the U.S. and other countries.[1] Meanwhile,
China is providing COVID-19 vaccines to the military
forces of the surrounding countries, which is viewed as
a conciliatory strategy to deal with the sense of vigilance
against China’s move related to the recent South China
Sea. As these situations suggest, going forward, it is
expected that strategic competition among countries will
be further intensified over the responses to COVID-19
infections. We need to continue to closely watch such
moves with great concern as security issues.

of Korea (ROK) and North Korea. Issues are existing
concerning Taiwan and the South China Sea. Furthermore,
with regard to Japan, territorial disputes over the Northern
Territories and Takeshima, both of which are inherent parts
of the territory of Japan, remain unresolved.
On top of this, recent years have seen a continued
tendency towards the prolongation of so-called
gray-zone situations, or situations that are neither
pure peacetime situations nor contingencies and are
associated with territories, sovereignty and economic
interests, and such situations may increase and expand
in the future. The gray-zone situations harbor the risk of
rapidly developing into more serious situations without
any clear forewarning.

of the forces. Furthermore, the administration indicated
its view that some allies which are pointed out as bearing
only a small burden of cost should shoulder their fair
share of the cost.
Under these circumstances, President Biden, who took
office on January 20, 2021, called for the necessity of unity,
not division, to American people in his inaugural address,
while towards the international community, he expressed
his basic stance that the United States will reengage itself
in the world again by repairing its alliances, and lead the
world not merely through demonstration of power, but
with credibility and moral authority. In regard to the point
of showing power, President Biden stated in his remarks
to the Department of Defense (DoD) in February 2021
that he would not hesitate to use force when necessary,
but he also emphasized his belief that “force should be a
tool of last resort, not first.”
Meanwhile, President Biden, in his address on
diplomatic policies in February, revealed the foreign
policy framework in response to the basic stance
mentioned earlier. In this speech, the President expressed
his recognition that the country would have to respond to a
new era with global issues such as the spread of infectious
diseases, climate change, and nuclear proliferation, as the
authoritarianism by China and Russia progresses. The
President then stated that these issues would not be dealt
with by the United States alone and expressed the need
to work closely with U.S. allies and partners, recognizing
alliances as the greatest asset to the country. In addition,
President Biden also indicated that a clear line between
foreign and domestic policies no longer exists, and that
the United States would place an urgent focus on domestic
economic renewal.
With regard to military policy, the Biden administration
clarified its intent to conduct a global posture review of
the U.S. Forces. In line with this speech by the President,
U.S. Defense Secretary Austin announced a statement
which stated the intention of the United States to
implement a global posture review concerning the U.S.
Forces’ deployment, resources, strategies and missions
while consulting with its allies and partners.
In the Interim National Security Strategic Guidance
(hereinafter “Interim Guidance”) published in March
2021, the Biden administration announced the policy
to put the highest priority on the U.S. military presence
in the Indo-Pacific and Europe. In particular, the
administration described China as “the only competitor
with the potential ability to mount a sustained challenge


to a stable and open international system” and indicated
its intent to counter China for a long term.
The Biden administration has adopted a policy
focused on initiatives based on a tough stance towards
China, which would allow the United States to win
strategic competition with China by rebuilding American
advantage through reinforcing domestic economic
foundations, reclaiming its leading role in international
institutions, defending democratic values at home and
around the world, modernizing U.S. military capabilities,
and revitalizing its alliances and partnerships.
In regard to the relationship with China, President
Biden shows his intention to pursue cooperation in areas
with shared interests, such as climate change and arms
control, and become involved in issues with China by
working with its allies and partners.
Concerning the U.S. policy on North Korea, the Biden
administration clarifies its intent to proceed with its
review, while working in close consultation with its allies
and partners.
With respect to Europe, the Biden administration
intends to conduct a comprehensive review of its
relationship with Russia, taking into consideration
Russia’s “malign activities”[1] and based on a policy that
does not allow such activities seen in recent years. While
implementing a global posture review, as described
above, the administration will halt the withdrawal of the
U.S. Forces from Germany, which was announced by the
Trump administration.[2]

Regarding the Middle East, the United States intends
to bring a responsible end to the long war in the region,
and in April 2021, President Biden announced the plan to
withdraw the U.S. Forces in Afghanistan by September
11 of the same year. If Iran returns to strict compliance
with the nuclear agreement, President Biden expresses
the U.S. position to return to the agreement as a starting
point for further negotiation. On top of these, the Biden
administration indicated its policy to end the U.S. support
for offensive operations in the military conflict in Yemen,
improve diplomacy for conflict resolving, and continue
to support the defense of Saudi Arabia.
Amid the inauguration of the new administration and
the indication of the direction of foreign policy based
on international cooperation, attention should be paid to
the trend of overall review of the security policy, which
will be conducted with a focus on the discussions with
U.S. allies and partners. Meanwhile, while addressing
countermeasures against the COVID-19 infection,
which the Biden administration positioned as the most

and force posture of the United States. The current
administration, in the Interim Guidance, positions Iran
and North Korea as regional actors and evaluates that
these countries “continue to pursue game-changing
technologies, while threatening U.S. allies and partners
and challenging regional stability.” In addition, the Biden
administration also shows a view that the United States
“faces challenges within countries whose governance is
fragile, and from influential non-state actors that have
the ability to disrupt American interests” and terrorism
and violent extremism remain significant threats. In
consideration of these recognitions, the United States,
in line with the Trump administration, positions threats
posed by China and Russia—with particular emphasis
on China—as priority issues to be addressed and appears
to implement a policy of dealing with threats posed by
North Korea, Iran, and radical terrorist groups, as well
as production, proliferation, and use of weapons of
mass destruction. Furthermore, the Biden administration
expresses high interest in the impact of climate change on
security issues. Given that Secretary of Defense Austin
mentioned at the Leaders’ Summit on Climate hosted
by President Biden in April 2021 that the perspective of
climate change would be essential for future U.S. security
policy, it is deemed that the U.S. security policy will be
promoted based on climate change issues.

is also positioned as an issue requiring reconciliation,
attention will be paid to what impacts the financial and
political resources needed for these issues will have on
U.S. security policy.


**Chapter**


**1 Perception about Security Environment**

The National Security Strategy (NSS) released in
December 2017 during the Trump administration
mentioned the three main sets of challengers against the
United States and its allies and partners, which are the
“revisionist powers” of China and Russia, the “rogue
states” of Iran and North Korea, and “transnational threat
organizations” including jihadist terrorist groups.
In addition, the National Defense Strategy (NDS)
published in January 2018 points out that the primary
concern in U.S. security is not terrorism but rather longterm strategic competition with China and Russia. It
also mentioned that China and Russia were undermining
the free and open international order constructed by the
United States and its allies, and it was increasingly clear
that China and Russia wanted to shape a world consistent
with their authoritarian model.
The Biden administration indicates in the Interim
Guidance that global challenges such as the spread of
infectious diseases, climate change, and proliferation
of weapons of mass destruction will bring serious
threats, and that “we must contend with the reality that
the distribution of power across the world is changing,
creating new threats.” The Guidance shows a view that
China and Russia have put considerable energy into
weakening American power and obstructing the U.S.
efforts to protect its interests and allies, with China in
particular rapidly increasing its external assertions. In
relation to this point, in his remarks to DoD Personnel
in February 2021, President Biden emphasized his view
that the U.S. would need to meet the challenges posed by
China, and mentioned a “China Task Force” established
by the DoD to consider the strategy operational concepts


The NSS developed by former President Trump is rooted
in the America First policy and realism in which power
plays a central role in international politics, and stresses
the need to rethink the policies of the past 20 years that
were based on the assumption that engagement with
rivals and their inclusion in the international community
would turn them into benign actors and trustworthy
partners. Moreover, the NSS sets up a strategic policy
to protect four vital interests in this competitive world:
(1) Protect the American people, the homeland, and the
American way of life; (2) Promote American prosperity;
(3) Preserve peace through strength; and (4) Advance
American influence.
Furthermore, in addition to rebuilding the U.S.
military to the strongest armed forces and strengthening
capabilities in many areas including space and
cyberspace, the United States is also striving to leverage
the balance of power in the Indo-Pacific, Europe, and
the Middle East. Moreover, while recognizing that allies
and partners are a great strength of the United States and
close cooperation is necessary, the United States has
demanded that its allies and partners demonstrate the will
to confront shared threats and contribute the capabilities.
It is also pointed out that although the United States is


-----

responding to the growing political, economic, and
military competition throughout the world, by ensuring
American military power is second to none and fully
integrating with its allies all instruments of power,
the United States will seek areas of cooperation with
competitors from a position of strength.
The NDS drawn up by then Secretary of Defense Mattis
based on the NSS considers the long-term competition
with China and Russia as the principal priorities of the
DoD because of the potential for the threats they pose
to U.S. security and prosperity to increase. Moreover, to
expand the competitive space, the following three lines of
effort are raised: (1) building a more lethal Joint Force;
(2) strengthening alliances and attracting new partners;
and (3) reforming the DoD for greater performance and
affordability.
Among these, (1) Building military power prioritizes
preparedness for war and in order to defeat aggression
by a major power and deter opportunistic aggression
elsewhere, it advances building flexible theater postures
and force deployment that offer mobility, resilience,
and readiness. It also advocates modernizing key
capabilities such as nuclear forces, space and cyberspace,
C4ISR (command, control, communication, computer,
intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance), missile
defense, and advanced autonomous systems, etc.
Further, although indicating its commitment to deter
aggression, it also demonstrates the stance that dynamic
military force employment, military posture, and
operations must introduce unpredictability to adversary
decisionmakers. For (2) Strengthening alliances, the
following three matters are emphasized: (i) Uphold a
foundation of mutual respect, responsibility, priorities,
and accountability, (ii) Expand regional consultative
mechanisms and collaborative planning, and (iii) Deepen
interoperability. On the other hand, there are expectations
that allies and partners contribute an equitable share to
mutually beneficial collective security, including effective
investment in modernizing their defense capabilities.
In March 2021, the Biden administration published
the Interim Guidance to indicate the direction taken by
the United States while the formulation of the national
security strategy is still in progress. This Guidance
states the necessity to renew the United States’ enduring
advantages in order to meet today’s challenges from a
position of strength, and that begins with the revitalization
of democracy, which is the most fundamental advantage
of the United States. More specifically, the Guidance
shows the future direction of the country’s efforts in the


form of: defending and nurturing the underlying sources
of American strength including democracy, economy,
national defense and so on; promoting a favorable
distribution of power to deter and prevent adversaries;
and leading and sustaining a stable and open international
system. The administration also expresses in the
Guidance that the United States is unable to achieve
these objectives alone. For that reason, the United States
will reinvigorate its alliances and partnerships around
the world, while also showing its intention to work with
allies to share responsibilities equitably and encourage
them to invest in their own comparative advantages. In
terms of the military aspect, the Biden administration
ensures that the U.S. Forces will receive the best training
in the world and continue to be a fully equipped armed
forces, while shifting its “emphasis from unneeded legacy
platforms and weapons systems to free up resources
for investments in the cutting-edge technologies and
capabilities.” In addition, the Guidance states the plan
that the Unites States will prioritize defense investment
in climate resiliency and clean energy.
The Biden administration has continued to conduct
a general review of national security policies even after
the publication of the Interim Guidance. The details of
the United States’ new national security policies and
national defense strategy formulated under the current
administration will attract attention.[3]

**3 Engagement in the Indo-Pacific Region**


**Chapter**


The Trump administration positioned the Indo-Pacific
region as the highest-priority region for the United States
and showed a stance of placing importance on the region
through the United States’ commitment to the region and
strengthening its presence.
During his November 2017 trip to Asia, in sympathy
with Japan’s vision for a “Free and Open Indo-Pacific,”
former President Trump expressed his intention to
emphasize compliance with principles such as respecting
the rule of law and freedom of navigation, and that he
would promote a “Free and Open Indo-Pacific” region,
as well as strengthen alliances in the region.
In relation to this, the NSS emphasizes that China
seeks to displace the United States in the Indo-Pacific
region and reorder the region in its favor, as well as
having mounted a rapid military modernization campaign
to limit U.S. access to the region and to provide itself a
freer hand there.
In the same way, the NDS pointed out that “China is


Both the National Security Strategy (NSS) and the National Defense Strategy (NDS) are required by law to be submitted to Congress within a certain period of time. Titles 50 and 10 of the United
States Code respectively stipulate that the NSS shall be submitted to Congress no later than 150 days after the date on which a new President takes office, and the NDS shall be submitted as soon


-----

leveraging military modernization, influence operations,
and predatory economics to coerce neighboring countries
to reorder the Indo-Pacific region to their advantage” and
is seeking regional hegemony.
Meanwhile, the Indo-Pacific Strategy Report (IPSR) of
the U.S. DoD, which was released in June 2019, fleshes
out this policy in accordance with the characteristics
of the Indo-Pacific region while retaining the strategic
directions of the NSS and the NDS. Noting first of all
that it is necessary to establish a force that is prepared to
win any conflict from its onset in order to achieve peace
through strength, the IPSR states that the United States will
ensure that combat-credible forces are forward-postured
in the Indo-Pacific region and will prioritize investments
that ensure lethality against high-end adversaries. Next,
arguing that the network of allies and partners is a force
multiplier to achieve deterrence, the IPSR states that the
United States will reinforce its commitment to established
alliances and partnerships while also expanding and
deepening relationships with new partners. The IPSR also
indicates that the United States will evolve U.S. alliances
and partnerships into a networked security architecture to
uphold the international rules-based order.
In July 2020, regarding China’s maritime expansion,
after the U.S. DoD expressed concern about China’s
decision to conduct military exercises in the South
China Sea, the United States deployed two Carrier Strike
Groups in the South China Sea for the first time in six
years and conducted naval exercises, and again gathered
two carrier strike groups to carry out exercises within
the same month. In this situation, then Secretary of the
State Mike Pompeo announced the stance of the United
States in the same month that China’s claim regarding
the resources for almost the entire South China Sea and
its activities attempting to control the resources were
completely illegal, and that there was no legal ground for
China’s unilateral imposition of its intention to others.
Based on this announcement, the Trump administration

July 2020, Nimitz and Ronald Reagan Carrier Strike Groups conducting exercises
in the South China Sea [U S Navy]


refused Chinese behavior of imposing the idea of “power
is justice” in the South China Sea and other waters. In
addition, in the “United States Strategic Approach to The
People’s Republic of China,” announced in May 2020,
the United States indicated that, as part of its worldwide
Freedom of Navigation Operations program, it would
counter China’s hegemonic assertions and excessive
claims, while, in August 2020, then Secretary of the State
Pompeo stated that the U.S. DoD was reinforcing the
Freedom of Navigation Operations in the East China Sea,
the South China Sea, and the Taiwan Strait.
As part of its activities around strengthening its
presence in the Indo-Pacific region, the U.S. Forces
deployed Marine Corps specification F-35B fighters to
MCAS Iwakuni in January 2017. The USS America, an
amphibious assault ship with enhanced ability to carry
F-35B fighters and other carrier-based planes, arrived
in Sasebo in December 2019 to replace the amphibious
assault ship USS Wasp. In addition, the amphibious
transport dock USS New Orleans was also deployed to
Sasebo that month. In Guam, the MQ-4C Triton maritime
surveillance unmanned aircraft system underwent its
first deployment in January 2020. Between January
and November 2019, the U.S. Coast Guard deployed
patrol boats on a rotational basis in the western Pacific
Ocean while working with the Seventh Fleet, and in
October 2020 the policy to deploy patrol boats in the
western Pacific Ocean was announced. The Army plans
to deploy a Multi-Domain Task Force in the region,
to undertake operations simultaneously in all domains
including the aspect of human cognition. In relation to
this, the Marine Corps expresses the idea of establishing
the Marine Littoral Regiment, which will focus on the
sea control and sea denial missions, and deploying it in
the region. In March 2018, the aircraft carrier USS Carl
Vinson made the first port call by a U.S. aircraft carrier
in over 40 years in Vietnam. Another port call in the
country was made in March 2020, by the aircraft carrier
USS Theodore Roosevelt.
The Biden administration announced that President
Biden had asserted the maintenance of the vision of a
“Free and Open Indo-Pacific” as a priority matter in the
U.S.-China summit telephone talk in February 2021 to
clarify the U.S. posture to pursue the vision would remain
unchanged. Similarly, in the summary announced after
the telephone conference between foreign ministers of the
United States and the Philippines in January 2021, the two
foreign ministers reaffirmed the importance of the U.S.Philippines Alliance for a “Free and Open Indo-Pacific,”
and the United States clearly expressed its stance to reject
China’s excessive claims for maritime interest in the
South China Sea, which was exceeding the range allowed
under the United Nations Convention on the Law of the


**Chapter**


-----

Sea (UNCLOS). With this stance, since February 2021,
the Biden administration announced multiple times that
it had sent U.S. Navy vessels to pass through the Taiwan
Strait to show the U.S. commitment to a “Free and Open
Indo-Pacific.” In the same month, the administration also
announced that the United States implemented Freedom
of Navigation Operations in the South China Sea. At this
announcement, the United States clearly indicated that
it bears a number of responsibilities in the Indo-Pacific
region, with the protection of the rights and freedom of
navigation in accordance with international law being
one of the responsibilities, and therefore, the country
would continue the Freedom of Navigation Operation.
Furthermore, the Biden administration announced that
the United States had deployed two Carrier Strike Groups
in the South China Sea in February 2021 and also that
U.S. carrier strike groups and amphibious ready groups
had conducted integrated exercises in the same area in
April 2021. The current administration expressed its
intention to continue showing its allies and others in the
region the efforts by the United States to promote a “Free
and Open Indo-Pacific.”
Based on the posture towards the Indo-Pacific
described above, the United States appears to continue to
be undertaking initiatives based on its vision of a “Free
and Open Indo-Pacific.”
In contrast, while talks between the United States and
North Korea have been conducted since their first summit
meeting in history held in June 2018, no specific progress
has been seen with regard to the dismantlement of North
Korea’s missiles and weapons of mass destruction.
Responding to that summit meeting, the U.S. DoD
suspended the U.S.-ROK command and control exercise
Ulchi-Freedom Guardian and the scheduled Vigilant
Ace U.S.-ROK bilateral annual flying exercise, and then
decided to conclude the Key Resolve and Foal Eagle
series of exercises usually held by the United States and
the ROK every spring. Then Acting Secretary of Defense
Patrick Shanahan expressed a willingness to maintain
U.S. Forces in the ROK, stating that close coordination
between the military activities of the United States and
the ROK will continue to support diplomatic efforts
and that the two countries were committed to ensuring
the continued combined defense posture of U.S.-ROK
combined forces and maintaining firm military readiness.
Amid this situation, as well as firing at least 20
ballistic missiles from May 2019 onwards, North Korea
announced in December 2019 that it would continue to
develop strategic weapons until the United States rolls
back its hostile policy.
In January 2021, according to North Korea’s
announcement, Chairman Kim Jong-un called the United


States North Korea’s “biggest enemy” and expressed
his view that whoever would be in power in the United
States, the U.S. policy on North Korea would not change,
while also remarking that the key to establishing a new
U.S.-North Korea relationship would be the withdrawal
of the hostile policy by the United States.
The Biden administration sees that North Korea
continues with its nuclear and missile plans, positions
it as an urgent priority issue to the United States, and
clarifies its policy on continuing to work on North Korea
denuclearization. Since the Biden administration has
announced its policy for conducting a comprehensive
review of the U.S. policy toward North Korea, attention
will be paid to the details of the new North Korea policy,
which will be formulated under the current administration.
The FY2021 National Defense Authorization Act,
which was enacted in January 2021, stipulates the
establishment of a program known as the Pacific
Deterrence Initiative (PDI). The PDI is intended to
strengthen the U.S. deterrence and defence posture in the
Indo-Pacific Region, provide security to allied nations
and partners, and strengthen U.S. regional capabilities
and readiness. The specific contents of the PDI will gain
attention in the future.

See Section 4-1-5 (1) (Relations with the United States), p. 112

**4 Innovation in the National Defense Field**


**Chapter**


The Trump administration positioned DoD innovation
initiatives as one of the top priorities. The NSS under
the former administration outlines a policy that the
United States must harness innovative technologies that
are being developed outside of the traditional defense
industrial base. The NDS also states that the DoD needs
innovation to surpass revisionist powers, and calls for
extensive investment in the military application of
autonomy, artificial intelligence, and machine learning
(AI/ML), including the rapid application of commercial
breakthroughs, to gain competitive military advantages.
In President Biden’s remarks at the DoD in
February 2021, the Biden administration, emphasizing
the importance of technologies in national defense
strategies, stated that the United States would deal with
dangers and opportunities generated through emerging
technologies, enhance its capabilities in cyberspace, and
lead in a new era of competition from deep sea to outer
space. With regard to strategic competition with China,
President Biden has indicated the view that technological
competition including innovation would become one of
the central issues. Attention should be paid to further
efforts in this area.


-----

On August 2, 2019, the Trump administration decided
to withdraw from the Intermediate-Range Nuclear Forces
(INF) Treaty with Russia as the administration alleged
that Russia violated the treaty.
On the same day, then Secretary of Defense Esper
announced that the DoD will fully pursue the development
of intermediate-range, conventional, ground-launched
cruise and ballistic missile systems whose test launches,
production and possession had been restricted by the
treaty. In August 2019, the United States conducted
a flight test of a conventionally-configured groundlaunched cruise missile with a range of more than 500 km
and subsequently conducted a flight test of a prototype
similarly configured ground-launched ballistic missile
that December.[6] Former President Trump mentioned the
need for arms control involving China, which has beefed
up medium-range missile capabilities outside the scope
of the INF Treaty.
In the Interim Guidance, the Biden administration
states that the United States will “take steps to reduce the
role of nuclear weapons in our national security strategy,
while ensuring our strategic deterrents remain safe,
secure, and effective, and that our extended deterrence
commitments to our allies remain strong and credible.”
The administration also mentions its intention to avoid
costly arms races, to pursue the establishment of a new
arms control framework if possible, and to “engage in
meaningful dialogue with Russia and China on a range
of emerging military technological developments that
implicate strategic stability.” In February 2021, the
Biden administration extended the New START Treaty
(Strategic Arms Reduction Treaty) for five years until
February 5, 2026, based on the agreement with Russia.
The extension of the New START Treaty seems to be
based on the administration’s plan indicated in the Interim
Guidance. President Biden stresses that the New START
Treaty extension is only the beginning of U.S. efforts to
address 21st century security challenges, and the country
will pursue further enhancement of the framework for
controlling nuclear weapons, using the time provided
by a five-year extension. First of all, regarding the New
START Treaty to which launchers, deployed missiles,
bombers, and deployed nuclear warheads related to
nuclear triad are subject, the administration indicates
that it will pursue the framework for arms control that
addresses all kinds of nuclear weapons with the Russian
Federation, in consultation with Congress and U.S. allies
and partners. In addition, President Biden indicates
that the United States will also pursue the arms control


**5 Nuclear and Missile Defense Policy**

The Nuclear Posture Review (NPR) released by the Trump
administration in February 2018 stated that, although the
United States had reduced the role and number of nuclear
weapons based on the aspiration that if the United States
took the lead in reducing nuclear arms, other states
would follow, the global threat conditions have worsened
markedly since the most recent NPR released in 2010 and
there now exist unprecedented threats and uncertainty, as
China and Russia have expanded their nuclear forces and
North Korea continues its pursuit of nuclear weapons
and missile capabilities. Given these circumstances,
the following were raised as the roles of U.S. nuclear
forces: (1) Deterrence of nuclear and nonnuclear attacks;
(2) Assurance of allies and partners; (3) Achievement of
U.S. objectives if deterrence fails; and (4) Capacity to
hedge against an uncertain future.
Also, while the United States would only consider
the employment of nuclear weapons in extreme
circumstances to defend the vital interests of the United
States, its allies, and partners, the NPR clearly states
that extreme circumstances could include significant
non-nuclear strategic attacks against the United States
and its allies, and a “no first use” policy is not justified
today. It also indicates that the United States maintains
a policy of retaining some ambiguity regarding the
precise circumstances that might lead to a U.S. nuclear
response. Furthermore, it also revealed that the United
States would apply a tailored approach to deterrence
across a spectrum of adversaries, threats and contexts,
and in addition, would ensure effective deterrence
by enhancing the flexibility and range of its nuclear
capabilities through nuclear modernization and the
development and deployment of new capabilities.
Specifically, in addition to sustaining and replacing
the nuclear triad,[4] as new capabilities, in the nearterm, the United States would modify a small number
of existing submarine-launched ballistic missiles
(SLBM) warheads to provide a low-yield option,[5]
and in the longer term, pursue a nuclear-armed sealaunched cruise missile (SLCM), leveraging existing
technologies, as well as incorporate nuclear capability
onto F-35A fighters as a replacement for the current
aging dual-capable aircraft (DCA). Also, the United
States has shown its commitment to extended deterrence
for its allies and, if necessary, maintaining the forwarddeployed capability with DCA and nuclear weapons in
regions outside Europe, including Northeast Asia.


**Chapter**


The nuclear triad consists of Minuteman III ICBM, Ballistic Missile Submarines (SSBN) armed with Trident II D5 SLBM, and strategic bombers B-52 and B-2.

In February 2020, then Under Secretary of Defense John Rood disclosed that the U.S. Navy had already deployed the W76-2 low-yield nuclear warhead to be carried by SLBMs. This complementary
capability is regarded as showing Russia and other potential adversaries that there is no advantage in the limited use of nuclear weapons.

growing nuclear arsenal.

See Section 5-3-1 (Nuclear Forces), p. 121

See

At the same time, the Missile Defense Review (MDR)
published by the Trump administration in January
2019 noted that North Korea continues to pose an
extraordinary threat to the United States and, with its
nuclear missiles, has the ability to threaten the U.S.
homeland, as well as U.S. territories, U.S. Forces, and
allies in the Pacific Ocean. It also pointed out that Russia
and China are developing advanced cruise missiles
and hypersonic missiles that challenge existing missile
defense systems. The MDR sets out three principles
governing U.S. missile defense: (1) homeland missile
defense will stay ahead of rogue states’ missile threats;
(2) missile defense will defend U.S. Forces deployed
abroad and support the security of allies and partners;
and (3) the United States will pursue new concepts
and technologies. It cited the elements of missile
defense strategy as (1) comprehensive missile defense
capabilities; (2) flexibility and adaptability; (3) tighter
offense-defense integration and interoperability; and
(4) importance of space. The MDR then presented a
policy of adopting a balanced and integrated approach
based on a combination of (1) deterrence; (2) active and
passive missile defenses; and (3) attack operations.
Under this policy, the United States plans to expand
investment in expanding and modernizing U.S. homeland
missile defense capabilities by such means as deploying
an additional 20 ground-based interceptors by 2023,
improving and deploying radar systems, and pursuing
efforts to counter intercontinental ballistic missiles
(ICBM) using SM-3 Block IIA. For regional defense, on
the other hand, the United States will procure additional
interceptor missiles for the Terminal High Altitude Area
Defense (THAAD), Aegis, and Patriot systems, as well
as increasing the number of Aegis BMD capable ships,
and equipping Aegis Ashore sites with the SM-3 Block
IIA. Regarding the pursuit of new technologies, the MDR
sets out a policy of developing the Multi-Object Kill
Vehicle (MOKV) to improve the ability to engage ICBM
warheads and decoys, as well as undertaking research and
development focused on (1) directed-energy weapons;
(2) space-based interceptor systems; and (3) interceptor
missiles with which F-35 fighters can be equipped, to


enable space-based sensors to be deployed and interception
to be carried out in the boost phase, with a view to
countering advanced threats, including hypersonic glide
vehicles (HGVs). As far as collaboration with allies and
partners is concerned, the MDR indicates a willingness
to focus on deepening interoperability, expanding burden
sharing, and encouraging investment by allies in missile
defense capabilities that are interoperable with those of
the United States.
The Biden administration has not published any
strategic documents showing its policy concerning
missile defense programs. However, given that, in March
2021, the commander of the U.S. Indo-Pacific Command
called for the importance of deploying Aegis Ashore in
Guam, missile defense seems to remain a key policy area.
The current administration’s future efforts in this area
will attract attention.

**6 FY2022 Budget**


**Chapter**


In May 2021, the Biden administration released the
President’s request for FY2022 discretionary funding.
The President’s discretionary request for the DoD is
US$715 billion, an approximately 1.6% increase from
the previous year. In the budget, the DoD has prioritized:
(1) defeating the COVID-19 pandemic; (2) countering the
pacing threat from China; (3) deterring threats emanating
from Russia, Iran, and North Korea; (4) innovating and
modernizing technologies such as hypersonic weapons
and artificial intelligence; and (5) tackling the climate
crisis, reflecting the strategic direction indicated in the
Interim Guidance.
The DoD has also requested US$5.1 billion for the
PDI to maintain a conventional military advantage
necessary to deter aggression in the Indo-Pacific region.
It has also prioritized nuclear enterprise modernization
and developing and fielding long range fires, and has
requested a US$112 billion research and development
budget for science and technology and advanced
capability enablers, its largest ever. The goals for military
end strength include securing 1,346,400 troops, a decline
of around 4,600 from FY2021, and, in terms of equipment,
the procurement of 85 F-35 fighters (96 in FY2021).

of the tactical air force is forward-deployed in Germany,

the United Kingdom, Japan, and the ROK, among others.
In regard to strategic offensive weapons including
nuclear force, the United States under the former Obama
administration proceeded with their reduction based on
a new Strategic Arms Reduction Treaty that came into
force in February 2011. It announced that its deployed
strategic warheads[7] stood at 1,357, while its deployed
delivery platforms stood at 651.[8] The United States is
studying the concept of a Conventional Prompt Global
Strike (CPGS), as an effort contributing to the nation’s
new ability to reduce reliance on nuclear weapons.
Moreover, in addressing the increasing threats in
cyberspace, in May 2018, the Cyber Command, which was
previously a subunified command under U.S. Strategic
Command, was elevated to a unified combatant command.
In August 2019, the United States founded the Space
Command to serve as a geographic unified combatant
command and then established the Space Force as the
sixth branch of the military within the Department of the
Air Force that December.

See Fig. I-2-1-2 (Structure of the Unified Combatant Command)


The operation of the U.S. Forces is not controlled by the
individual branches of the broader armed forces; rather it
is operated under the command of the Unified Combatant
Commands, composed of forces from multiple branches
of the armed forces. The Unified Combatant Commands
consist of four commands with functional responsibilities
and seven commands with regional responsibilities.
The U.S. ground forces have about 480,000 Army
soldiers and about 180,000 Marines, which are forwarddeployed in Germany, the ROK, and Japan, among
other countries.
The U.S. maritime forces have about 970 vessels
(including about 70 submarines) totaling about 7.3 million
tons. The 7th Fleet is responsible for the western Pacific
and the Indian Ocean; the 3rd Fleet in the eastern Pacific;
the 4th Fleet in South America and the Caribbean Sea; the
2nd Fleet in U.S. East Coast, North Atlantic Ocean, and
Arctic Ocean; the 6th Fleet in the Mediterranean Sea and
Africa; and the 5th Fleet in the Persian Gulf, the Red Sea,
and the northwest Indian Ocean.
The U.S. air forces have roughly 3,530 combat
aircraft across the Air Force, Navy, and Marine Corps.

in the ROK, and the U.S. Army Alaska. Additionally, the
Army Pacific assigns approximately 2,500 personnel to
commands in Japan, such as I Corps (Forward) and the
Headquarters, U.S. Army Japan Command.[9]

The U.S. Pacific Fleet consists of the 7th Fleet, which
is responsible for the Western Pacific and the Indian
Ocean, and the 3rd Fleet, responsible for the East Pacific
and Bering Sea. The U.S. Pacific Fleet in total controls
about 200 vessels.[10] The 7th Fleet mainly consists of a
carrier strike group with main stationing locations in
Japan and Guam. Their mission is to defend territorial
lands, people, sea lines of communication, and the critical
national interests of the United States and its allies. An
aircraft carrier, amphibious ships, and Aegis cruisers
among others are assigned to the 7th Fleet.
The U.S. Marine Corps Forces Pacific deploys one
Marine Expeditionary Force each in the U.S. mainland
and Japan. Of this force, about 21,000 personnel are
in the 3rd Marine Division and the 1st Marine Aircraft
Wing, which are equipped with F-35B fighters and other
aircraft, in Japan. In addition, maritime pre-positioning
ships loaded with heavy equipment and others are
deployed in the Western Pacific.[11]

The U.S. Pacific Air Force has three air forces, of
which three air wings (equipped with F-16 fighters and
C-130 transport aircraft) are deployed to the 5th Air Force
stationed in Japan and two air wings (equipped with F-16
fighters) to the 7th Air Force stationed in the ROK.

The United States, a Pacific nation, continues to play
an important role in ensuring the peace and stability of
the Indo-Pacific region by deploying the Indo-Pacific

Navy, Air Force and Marine Corps in the region. The IndoPacific Command is a geographic combatant command
which is responsible for the largest geographical area,
and its subordinate unified commands include U.S.
Forces Japan and U.S. Forces Korea.
The Indo-Pacific Command consists of the U.S.
Army Pacific, U.S. Pacific Fleet, U.S. Marine Corps
Forces Pacific, and U.S. Pacific Air Forces, which are all
headquartered in Hawaii.
The Army Pacific’s subordinate commands include the

Asia region in order to improve the posture of the Navy in the Indo-Pacific region. Regarding the First Fleet, Secretary Braithwaite explained that it would belong to the U.S. Pacific Fleet and would
take some load off the Seventh Fleet by dividing the area of responsibility the Seventh Fleet currently covers.

that would dramatically change future warfare.
China’s 2019 white paper, “China’s National Defense
in the New Era,” released in July 2019, notes that
“intelligent warfare is on the horizon,” indicating that
attention should be paid to Chinese forces’ efforts to use
artificial intelligence (AI) technology.
Along with efforts to reinforce its operational
capabilities, China is engaging in unilateral and coercive
attempts to change the status quo based on its own
assertions incompatible with the existing international
order, and has been expanding and intensifying its
military activities in maritime and aerial domains, notably
in the East China Sea. China, particularly regarding
maritime issues where its interests conflict with others’,
continues to act in an assertive manner, which includes
dangerous acts that could cause unintended contingencies.
Additionally, China continues to demonstrate its
willingness to realize its unilateral assertions without
making any compromises, steadily moving forward with
efforts to change the status quo by coercion and to create
a fait accompli.
The Chinese military leadership has exhibited the
“struggle” against the Senkaku Islands, an inherent
territory of Japan, the establishment of the “East China
Sea Air Defense Identification Zone (ADIZ),”[1] its
Navy and Air Force’s “regular patrols,” and others as

emphasized to continue improving the Chinese military’s
operational capabilities. Furthermore, the Chinese
military forces have rapidly expanded and intensified
activities including those in the areas surrounding Japan,
such as the East China Sea, Pacific Ocean and Sea of
Japan. Given these facts, there is a high probability that
China would not only attempt to make such activities


**1 General Situation**

For more than 30 years, China has sustained high-level
growth of its defense budget without transparency,
engaging in broad, rapid improvement of its military
power in qualitative and quantitative terms with focus
on nuclear, missile, naval and air forces. In doing so, it
has attached importance to strengthening its operational
capabilities for steadily acquiring information
superiority as a means of both enhancing operational
capabilities throughout the Chinese military and gaining
asymmetrical capabilities to effectively impede enemies
with overall military superiority from exerting their
strength. Specifically, China has been increasingly
emphasizing endeavors to achieve dominance in new
domains. For example, it has been rapidly expanding its
capabilities in the cyber domain, enabling it to disrupt
enemy communications networks, and in the field of
electromagnetic spectrum, which offers the potential
to render enemy radar and other equipment ineffective,
thereby hampering their ability to exercise their military
might. In addition, it continues to build capacity to make
it possible to restrict enemies’ use of space. Bolstering
these capabilities will reinforce China’s “Anti-Access/
Area-Denial (A2/AD)” capabilities and lead to the
establishment of operational capabilities further afield.
China is also prioritizing efforts to increase practical joint
operational capabilities through military modernization
including reforms. Additionally, while implementing a
policy of civil-military fusion across the board, with the
aim of promoting two-way links between military and
civilian resources in technology development and various
other fields, China is striving to develop and acquire
cutting-edge technologies that can be used for military
purposes. Cutting-edge technologies that China seeks to


**Chapter**


**Key Words** **Anti-Access/Area-Denial**

**(A2/AD) capabilities**

The A2/AD capabilities represent a concept given by the United States.
Anti-Access or A2 capabilities refer mainly to long-range capabilities to
block adversaries from entering some operating zones. Area-Denial or AD
capabilities refer to short-range capabilities to limit adversaries’ freedom
of action within operating zones.


**Key Words** **Civil-military fusion**

Civil-military fusion is an initiative promoted by China as a national strategy
designed to promote the military use of civilian resources and the civilian
use of military technologies in peacetime as well as emergency, in addition
to the traditional development of defense mobilization arrangements for
emergency. In particular, initiatives in seas, outer space, cyberspace,
artificial intelligence (AI), which are referred to as “emerging areas” for
China are viewed as priority areas for civil-military fusion.


On November 23, 2013, China established the “East China Sea ADIZ” including the Senkaku Islands misleadingly indicated as if they were China’s territory. China requires aircraft flying in the zone

routine but also further expand and intensify them both
qualitatively and quantitatively. Such Chinese military
trends, combined with insufficient transparency about
China’s defense policies and military affairs, have become
a matter of grave concern to the region including Japan
and the international community and should continue to
be closely monitored in the future.

**2 Defense Policies**


China has described the objectives of its defense policies
and the missions of its military forces as: supporting
the CCP’s leadership, China’s characteristic socialism
system, and the modernization of its socialism,
defending the nation’s sovereignty, unification and
security, backing the nation’s sustainable “peaceful
development” through protecting its maritime and
overseas national interests, building strong national
defense and massive military forces commensurate with
the interests of the nation’s security and the interests
of development, and providing strong assurances for
realizing the “Chinese dream” of the great revival of
the Chinese nation. China contends that these national
defense policies are “defensive” in nature.[2]

For the development of national defense and
military forces, China has employed a policy of
building the “system of modern military power with
Chinese characteristics” by sustaining the military
development under the party, the military buildup
through reforms, military promotion based on science
and technology, and law-based military governance, by
pursuing practical capabilities that “can fight and win
a war” by giving greater priority to the civil-military
fusion, by promoting the fusion and development of
mechanization and informatization, and by accelerating
the intelligentization of military forces. This might have
apparently deepened a policy of giving priority to the
informatization of military forces based on a military
strategy to win informatized local wars in response to
the global trend of military development. Such military
buildup in China apparently indicates that China has
given top priority to dealing with a Taiwan contingency
by improving its capabilities to deter or deny Taiwan’s
independence and foreign military support for the
Taiwanese independence, and has recently considered
the improvement of operational capabilities in more
distant waters to protect its expanding overseas interests.
Furthermore, China seems to emphasize not only
physical means but also non-physical means in military
affairs and warfare. It regards the concept of “Three

the Communist Party of China in October 2020 [China News Service/Jiji Press Photo]

Warfares” — “Media Warfare,” “Psychological Warfare,”
and “Legal Warfare” — as part of the political work of
the military. In addition, China has set forth a policy
of coordinating military struggle closely with political,
diplomatic, economic, cultural, and legal endeavors.
As for the future goals of the development of national
defense and military forces, General Secretary Xi
Jinping’s report to the 19th CCP National Congress in
October 2017 and the defense white paper released in
2019 noted that China would try to (1) basically achieve
mechanization and make great progress in informatization
to dramatically improve strategic capabilities by 2020,
(2) basically complete the modernization of national
defense and military forces by 2035, and (3) generally
transform Chinese forces into world-class forces by the
mid-21st century. These goals reportedly indicate that the
third stage of the “Three Stage Development Strategy”
for the basic modernization of national defense and
military forces by the middle of the 21st century would
be achieved 15 years ahead of schedule. The goals thus
might have been based on faster-than-expected progress
in the military modernization for China itself. In the
5th Plenary Session of the 19th Central Committee of
the Communist Party of China in October 2020, China
expressed its determination to achieve a struggle goal
for the 100th anniversary of the foundation of the PLA
in 2027. This goal could have been newly set as an
interim goal up to the second stage with the deadline for
achievement in 2035, following the near achievement
of the goal of the first stage described above. However,
China has recognized a wide gap between the real
military modernization level and the level required for
national security, and between Chinese and world-class


**Chapter**


-----

military forces. Based on that recognition, China may
further accelerate the military modernization against the
backdrop of national power development and General
Secretary Xi’s enhancement of his power base in the CCP
and expansion of his power as Chairman of the Central
Military Commission.[3]

**3 Transparency Concerning Defense Policies**
**and Military Affairs**


Defense in the New Era.” Although defense white papers
released in 2013 and 2015 covered specific topics only,
with the volume of descriptions reduced, the 2019 white
paper covered defense policies in general.
China’s influence in the international community
has risen politically, economically, and militarily. It has
become increasingly important for China to improve
its transparency regarding defense policies and military
affairs, provide fact-based explanations about its
activities, and share and observe international rules as
a responsible country in the international community
to allay concerns about China. It is strongly hoped that
China will increase transparency through such efforts as
specific and accurate information disclosure.

**4 National Defense Budget**


China has neither set out a clear and specific future
vision of its military strengthening, nor ensured adequate
transparency of its decision-making process in relation
to military and security affairs. Moreover, China has not
fully disclosed information such as specific weapons in
possession, procurement goals and results, organization
and locations of major units, records of main military
operations and exercises, and a detailed breakdown of its
national defense budget.
Incidents in which Chinese authorities provide
factually inaccurate explanations or refuse to admit
facts regarding Chinese military activities have been
confirmed, inciting concerns over China’s military
decision-making and actions. For example, the
submerged transit of a Chinese Navy submarine through
Japan’s contiguous zone around the Senkaku Islands
was confirmed in January 2018, but China did not
acknowledge this.
Similarly, explanations that stoke concerns about
Chinese military decision-making and actions are also
evident in comments about the South China Sea, where
China is seeking to unilaterally change the status quo and
to create a fait accompli. At the press conference after
the U.S.-China summit meeting in September 2015,
President Xi Jinping stated “China does not have any
intention to pursue militarization” in the South China
Sea, but in February the following year, Foreign Minister
Wang Yi described the facilities in the South China Sea
as “necessary self-defense facilities” that China was
developing in accordance with international law. In 2017,
reports in official media asserted that China had rationally
expanded the area of its “islands and reefs” in the South
China Sea to “strengthen the necessary military defense.”
China has released a defense white paper almost every
two years since 1998. Most recently, it released a defense
white paper in July 2019 for the first time in approximately
four years. The latest one was titled “China’s National

for FY2021 was approximately 3,553 billion yuan
(approximately 20,330.1 billion Japanese yen when the
value is mechanically converted at 15 yen per yuan).[4]
This initial budget amount represented a growth of
approximately 6.8% (approximately 87.3 billion yuan)
compared to the initial budget amount for the previous
fiscal year. China’s announced national defense budget
recorded a double-digit increase almost every year
between FY1989 and FY2015. The nominal size of
China’s announced national defense budget grew
approximately 42-fold in the 30 years from FY1991 and
approximately 2.3-fold in the 10 years from FY2011.
China positions the buildup of defense capabilities as
important a task as economic development. It is believed
that China has continued to invest resources in the
improvement of its defense capabilities in tandem with its
economic development. However, there have been many
years in which the announced annual national defense
budget increase rate exceeded the economic growth (an
increase in gross domestic product). Attention is to be
paid to how the slowdown in China’s economic growth
would affect its national defense budget.
In addition, it is noted that the amount of the
announced defense budget is considered to be only a
part of its actual military expenditures. For example,
it is believed that the announced defense budget does
not include foreign equipment procurement costs or
research and development (R&D) expenses. According
to an analysis of the U.S. DoD, actual defense spending


The Central Military Commission is a leading and commanding organ to China’s armed forces. Formally, there are the CCP CMC and the People’s Republic of China CMC. However, each consists of
the same members, indicating both commissions as an organ for the party to control the armed forces.

China’s announced defense budget exceeded Japan’s defense-related expenditures in Chinese FY2007 and reached approximately four times as much as in Chinese FY2020 (automatically converted i

Note: This basically shows the defense budget within “the central government’s general public budget,” which had been named as “the central fiscal expenditures” prior to
FY2014. Year-on-year growth rate compares the budget of a given year against the initial budget of the previous year. Note that FY2002 defense budget was calculated
based on the increased amount from the defense budget in the previous FY because only the amount and rate of growth were released. For FY2016, FY2018, FY2019,
FY2020 and FY2021, the amount of “the central government expenditures,” which are part of the central government’s general public budget, are used because only
the central government expenditures were announced.


**(1) Military Reforms**
In recent years, China has been carrying out military
reforms seen as the largest in its history. In November
2015, Chairman Xi unveiled China’s official position on
a specific direction of the military reforms for the first
time, announcing that the military reforms would be
carried out by 2020.
By the end of 2016, the so-called “above-the-neck”
reforms in the center of the military were reported
to have basically been completed. Specifically, they
abolished the PLA’s seven Military Regions and created
five new Theaters with primary responsibility for
command of operations, namely, the Eastern Theater,
Southern Theater, Western Theater, Northern Theater,
and Central Theater. In addition, they also formed the
PLA Army (PLAA) Headquarters—ranked equally
with the PLA Navy (PLAN) and PLA Air Force
(PLAAF) Headquarters—, the Rocket Force (PLARF),
the Strategic Support Force (PLASSF), and the Joint
Logistics Support Force. Moreover, the headquarters for
the entire PLA were replaced by 15 functional sections
under the CMC, including the Joint Staff Department,
Political Work Department, Logistics Support
Department, and Equipment Development Department.
Since 2017, military reforms have been making steady
progress with the start of what are called full-scale
“below-the-neck” military reforms at the field level.


in FY2019 was US$26 billion more than the announced
national defense budget amount.[5]

As for a breakdown of the national defense budget, past
defense white papers specified personnel, training and
sustainment, and equipment expenses for the announced
national defense budgets for FY2007, FY2009 and
FY2010-2017 (and expenses for active, reserve and
militia forces for FY2007 and FY2009). However, no
more details have been given.

**5 Military Posture**


China’s armed forces are composed of the PLA, the
People’s Armed Police Force (PAP), and the militia. It is
provided that these bodies be instructed and commanded
by the Central Military Commission (CMC). The PLA is
defined as a people’s force created and led by the CCP,
comprising the Army, the Navy, the Air Force, the Rocket
Force, the Strategic Support Force, the Joint Logistics
Support Force, etc.
The PAP is designed to engage mainly in patrol,
emergency response, counterterrorism, maritime rights
protection and law enforcement, emergency rescue,
defense operations, etc. The militia is planned to engage in
economic construction, etc., in peacetime and undertake
logistic support missions in an emergency.


-----

For example, the expansion of the Navy Marine Corps,
whose missions include amphibious landing operations,
has been confirmed along with the unification of PAP
leadership and command system under the CMC,
and the reorganization of 18 Group Armies into 13, a
reduction of 300,000 soldiers, the transfer of the coast
guard to the PAP, etc.
It is considered that these series of reforms are
designed to build more practical military forces by
improving their joint operational capabilities and
strengthening the military’s readiness, including the
development of military capabilities and organizational
management in peacetime. In addition, it has been noted
that the reorganization of the headquarters is a means
of tackling corruption at the center of the military by
decentralizing the leading organs. Since the 19th CCP
National Congress in October 2017, many members seen
as connected deeply to Chairman Xi have been appointed
to the CMC. It has been noted that many officers trusted
deeply by Chairman Xi have been promoted to senior
positions and the rank of general. Given these points,
it is thought that Chairman Xi is attempting to further
enhance his leadership in the CMC and the military.
There are views that dissatisfaction is growing within
the military and among veterans because of the rapid
reforms. Given that China had promoted military reforms
until 2020, the newly revised “National Defense Law
of the People’s Republic of China” (revised National
Defense Law) was adopted at the 24th Session of the 13th
Standing Committee of the China’s National People’s
Congress in December 2020. In this law, protecting
China’s overseas interests, penetration of “Xi Jinping’s
thoughts on strengthening the military,” and space,
electromagnetic spectrum, and cyberspace as critical
security areas, etc., were newly stipulated. It was assumed
that China was aiming to create an impression that it had
achieved major policy and system reforms by enacting
the revised National Defense Law in 2020. Attention will
focus on the outcome of these military reforms.

**(2) Nuclear and Missile Forces**
China has continued independent efforts to develop
nuclear weapons and missiles for their delivery since
the mid-1950s, indicating its apparent attempt to ensure
nuclear deterrence, supplement its conventional forces
with nuclear capabilities and secure its influence on
the international community. It is regarded that China’s
nuclear strategy is to deter any nuclear attack on its
territory by maintaining a nuclear force structure able to


conduct retaliatory nuclear attacks on a limited number of
targets such as cities in adversary countries, should China
be subject to nuclear attacks. China has explained that it
is committed to “no first use” of nuclear weapons under
any circumstances, to “unconditional negative security
assurance” that it would not use or threaten to use nuclear
weapons against non-nuclear-weapon states or nuclearweapon-free zones unconditionally, and to keeping its
nuclear capabilities at the minimum level required for
national security. In recent years, however, doubts have
been expressed about the explanation.[6] Furthermore,
the United States has been inviting China to participate
in the New START Treaty (Strategic Arms Reduction
Treaty), with the upper limit of strategic nuclear forces
determined between the United States and Russia, but
China has consistently been denying its participation.
China is viewed as having given priority to
conventional missile capabilities since the 1990s
because of the growing significance of precision-strike
capabilities in the global military trend. In addition,
China is promoting the expansion and modernization
of nuclear forces, and it is expected that China will at
least double the number of nuclear warheads in the next
10 years, and it is reportedly pursuing the so-called
“nuclear triad.”[7] China is expected to continue to attach
importance to its nuclear and missile forces.
China possesses ballistic missiles of various types
and ranges, including ICBMs, SLBMs, intermediaterange ballistic missiles (IRBMs)/medium-range ballistic
missiles (MRBMs), and short-range ballistic missiles
(SRBMs). The update of China’s ballistic missile forces
from a liquid propellant system to a solid propellant
system is improving their survivability and readiness.
Moreover, it is believed that China is working to
increase their performance by such means as extending
ranges, improving targeting accuracy, and employing
maneuverable reentry vehicles (MaRVs) and multiple
independently targetable reentry vehicles (MIRVs).
China’s main ICBMs, its strategic nuclear asset, had
been the fixed-site liquid-propellant DF-5 missiles.
However, China has in recent years deployed the DF-31,
which is a mobile-type ICBM with a solid propellant
system mounted onto a transporter erector launcher
(TEL). China is developing the new DF-41 ICBM, which
is viewed to be able to fly up to approximately 11,200
km and carry 10 warheads. It made its first appearance
in the military parade to mark the 70th anniversary
of the founding of the People’s Republic of China in
October 2019.

According to the annual report “Military and Security Developments Involving the People’s Republic of China,” U.S. DoD (2020)


-----

With regard to submarine-launched ballistic missiles
(SLBM), it is considered that Jin-class Nuclear-Powered
Ballistic Missile Submarines (SSBN) equipped with
JL-2 SLBMs with an estimated range of approximately
8,000 km are operational. It is believed that China’s
strategic nuclear capabilities will improve significantly
through nuclear deterrence patrols using the Jin-class
SSBNs. Furthermore, it has been pointed out that China
is also developing the JL-3 SLBM with the extended
range of 12,000 to 14,000 km and a new SSBN for
carrying the JL-3.
China’s missile forces have been put outside the
framework of the U.S.-Russia INF Treaty, and China
holds numerous amounts of ground-launched missiles
with ranges between 500 and 5,500 km that had been
subjected to the INF treaty. It is also deemed that China
is ahead of the United States in relation to groundlaunched ballistic missiles and cruise missiles.[8] As for
the IRBMs/MRBMs covering the Indo-Pacific region
including Japan, China has the mobile solid-propellant
DF-21 and DF-26, which can be transported and operated
on TELs. These are viewed as capable of carrying both
conventional and nuclear warheads. China possesses
ballistic missiles carrying conventional warheads with
high targeting accuracy based on the DF-21, including
the DF-21D anti-ship ballistic missile (ASBM), called
“carrier killer,” which carries conventional warheads
to attack overwater ships including aircraft carriers.
The DF-26, which has a range including Guam and is
called “Guam killer,” is considered a “second-generation
ASBM” developed on the basis of the DF-21D. It was
announced in April 2018 that the DF-21D had “formally
joined the order of battle.” China also possesses the CJ20 (CJ-10) long-range land-attack cruise missile with a
range of at least 1,500 km, as well as the H-6 bomber that
is capable of carrying this cruise missile. It is deemed
that these missiles complement ballistic missile forces,
covering the Indo-Pacific region including Japan. In the
military parade to celebrate the 70th anniversary of its
founding in October 2019, CJ-100/DF-100, which is
said to be a supersonic cruise missile, also made its first
public appearance. The deployment of these ASBMs
and cruise missiles is expected to strengthen China’s
“A2/AD” capabilities. Concerning SRBMs, China has
deployed a large number of solid-propellant DF-16, DF15, and DF-11 missiles facing Taiwan. It is believed that
their ranges cover a part of Japan’s Southwestern Islands
including the Senkaku Islands.
Furthermore, China is believed to be rapidly


developing several HGVs that would be launched with
ballistic missiles to penetrate missile defenses. Their
flight tests have reportedly been conducted since 2014.
In the military parade to mark the 70th anniversary of
China’s founding in October 2019, the DF-17 MRBM
viewed as capable of carrying a hypersonic glide vehicle
made its first public appearance. In August 2018, China is
believed to have tested a hypersonic vehicle featuring the
“waverider” design. These vehicles are said to be more
difficult for missiles to intercept, because they fly low at
very high speeds and are highly maneuverable.
China is also thought to be devoting energy to the

development of missile defense technology. It is believed
to have conducted several tests on midcourse missile
interception technology since 2010, and the most recent
test was conducted in February 2021. In October 2019,
Russian President Putin noted that Russia was supporting
China’s development of “a missile-attack early warning
system.” China has been working on building ballistic
missile defense systems including interception missiles
and warning systems Given that ballistic missile defense


technology has the potential to be applied to missiles
capable of destroying satellites, attention will focus on
future Chinese missile defense trends.

**(3) Ground Forces**
China has the third largest ground forces in the world,
following India and North Korea, with approximately
970,000 personnel. China has sought to improve the
operational capabilities of ground forces pursuing the
downsizing, multifunctionality, and modularization of
military units. Specifically, it is believed to be improving
ground forces’ mobility using measures such as shifting
from theater defense to trans-theater mobility and working
to motorize and mechanize infantry units. According
to some analyses, the Navy Marine Corps continues
to complete its expansion and focus on expeditionary
operations, while others discuss that, overall, reform and
modernization of the Navy Marine Corps are delayed.[9]

China has annually conducted Stride, Firepower, and
Sharp Sword maneuver-exercises that cut across multiple
regions. They are aiming at verifying and improving the
capabilities necessary to deploy army troops to remote
areas, such as long-distance maneuvering capabilities of
the Army, and logistical support capabilities that include
mobilizing militias and public transportation. China has
also conducted combined military branch and service
exercises under Joint Action since 2014. Furthermore, it
has been reported that force-on-force training has been
frequently conducted to improve practical operational
capabilities. These facts suggest China’s attempt to
improve its practical joint operational capabilities.
The above described PAP consists of internal
security corps, which are organized and established
based on administrative divisions such as provinces
and autonomous regions, mobile corps, which do not
have fixed areas in charge and perform missions across
different areas, and the Coast Guard, described later,
which is said to safeguard national sovereignty, security,

and maritime interests as well as implements law
enforcement. The PAP is said to own various equipment
such as armored vehicles, rotary-wing aircraft, and
heavy machine guns. Furthermore, it is reported that the
PAP focuses on maintaining internal security and joint
operations with the PLA, and is developing capabilities
for readiness, mobility and counter-terrorism operations.[10]

See Fig. I-2-2-4 (Deployment of the People’s Liberation Army [image])

**(4) Naval Forces**
The naval forces consist of three fleets: North Sea Fleet,
East Sea Fleet, and South Sea Fleet. China’s naval forces,
which own a larger scale of ships exceeding the U.S.
Navy and are said to be the largest navy in the world,[11]
are rapidly modernizing. The Chinese Navy promotes the
mass production of its indigenous Yuan-class submarines
with improved quietness, as well as surface combatant
ships with improved air defense and anti-ship attack
capabilities. In January 2020, the Navy commissioned the
first Renhai-class destroyer among its largest destroyers,
and the second destroyer was commissioned in March
2021. The Renhai-class destroyer is said to be equipped
with a vertical launch system (VLS) with 112 launch
cells, almost twice the number of launch cells as the
new Luyang III-class destroyer. The VLS is capable of
launching long-range land-attack cruise missiles and YJ18 anti-ship cruise missiles with a supersonic terminal
attack capability. In addition, the Navy is increasing the
number of large landing ships and supply ships. Since
September 2019, Type-075 large landing ships have been
launched in sequence, and “Hainan,” which is believed
to be the first ship, commissioned in April 2021. Since
September 2017, Fuyu-class fast combat support ships
(comprehensive supply ships) have been in operation for
replenishment for the aircraft carrier group. It has also
been pointed out that China is developing new submarines
capable of carrying land-attack cruise missiles.
With regard to aircraft carriers, China’s first aircraft
carrier “Liaoning,” following its commission in
September 2012, reportedly made its first advance to the
South China Sea in November 2013 and to the Pacific
Ocean in December 2016. In the same month of 2016,
the “Liaoning” conducted its first comprehensive live
action, including live firing by carrier-based fighters,
in the Bohai Sea. It was announced that the “Liaoning”
participated in a naval review in the South China Sea
and advanced to the Pacific Ocean for force-on-force
training including carrier-based fighters from March to
April 2018. China’s first indigenous aircraft carrier (its

second carrier) was launched in April 2017, and then
it was named “Shandong” and commissioned in Sanya
of Hainan Island in December 2019. It is believed that
the “Shandong” passed through the Taiwan Strait in
December 2020. The “Shandong,” with a ski-jump
flight deck, is an improved version of the “Liaoning,”
reportedly carrying a greater number of aircraft than
the “Liaoning.” China is reportedly building its second
indigenous aircraft carrier, which could be equipped with
an electromagnetic catapult system to operate fixed-wing
early warning aircraft. It has also been pointed out that
China has plans to build nuclear-powered aircraft carriers.
China is believed to have been developing and
deploying unmanned surface vehicles (USVs) and
unmanned underwater vehicles (UUVs) that are available
for military purposes. Such equipment, though being
relatively cheap, are viewed as representing an asymmetric
force to effectively prevent adversaries from winning
maritime supremacy, particularly underwater supremacy.
Given these developments concerning the naval forces,
China appears to be steadily building up capabilities for
conducting operations in more distant waters in addition
to near sea defense.
The PAP, one of the China’s armed forces other than
the military, has the Coast Guard under its umbrella, one
of whose missions is the protection of maritime interests.


The Coast Guard consists of three groups: North, East
and South Sea Sub-bureaus. Chinese government ships
belonging to the Coast Guard have recently been designed
to be larger and armed. At the end of December 2020,
the China Coast Guard was viewed as one of possessing
131 ships with full displacement of 1,000 tons or more,[12]
including two 10,000-ton-class patrol ships, among the
world’s largest ones. Some China Coast Guard vessels
have been confirmed as armed with 76 mm large guns
that may be as powerful as the Navy vessels. The newer
ships are significantly larger and more capable than
older ships, and are said to be equipped with helicopter
facilities, high-capacity water cannons, and guns ranging

Force (PAP Law) was revised, and “protection of
maritime interests and law enforcement” were added
to the duties of the PAP. The revised version also
stipulates that the PAP shall be centrally and uniformly
guided by the Central Committee and the CMC of the
People’s Republic of China. In the revision of this
law, the duty of “protection of the maritime interests
and law enforcement” was supposed to be stipulated
separately by law. However, the Coast Guard Law of
the People’s Republic of China (Coast Guard Law),
which stipulates the Coast Guard’s responsibilities and
authority including the use of weapons, was newly
enacted in January 2021 and entered into force in
February 2021. A Spokesperson of the Chinese Ministry
of Foreign Affairs explains that the establishment of
the CCG Law is merely a normal legislative activity
of the National People’s Congress and that China’s
maritime policy has not changed. However, the Coast
Guard Law includes problematic provisions in terms
of their inconsistency with international law. Sources
of inconsistency include, among others, ambiguity as
to geographical areas the Coast Guard Law applies
and how the rules governing the use of weapons are
implemented. The Coast Guard Law must not be
allowed to infringe on the legitimate interests of the
relevant countries including Japan. Furthermore, the
raising of tensions in the East China Sea and other
sea areas is completely unacceptable. The United
States and some neighboring countries have expressed
concerns about the law. In order to allay other countries’
concerns regarding China, it is strongly hoped that
China will improve transparency through specific and
accurate outward-facing explanations in the future.
It is pointed out that, among the militia, whose status is
China’s armed force other than the military, the so-called
maritime militia is playing the role of the front guard
for supporting China’s maritime interests. The maritime
militia is said to operate in the South China Sea, etc. and
consist of fishermen and residents of isolated islands. In
2009, when Chinese naval and other ships intercepted
the Impeccable, a U.S. Navy ocean surveillance ship,
maritime militia members were reportedly seen aboard
a fishing boat that was trying to remove a sonar from the
U.S. ship. In 2019, when Chinese maritime survey ships
were operating in Vietnam’s exclusive economic zone,
maritime militia ships were reportedly seen along with
China Coast Guard vessels. In addition, it is pointed out
that while the maritime militia often rents fishing vessels
from companies or individual fishermen, China has built
a state-owned fishing fleet in the South China Sea for the
maritime militia. It is also pointed out that the Hainan

30mm to 76mm, so that they are viewed as being able
to withstand long-term operations and engage in distantwater activities.[13]

The organizational enhancement of the Coast Guard
has also been confirmed. China’s maritime surveillance
had been conducted by the China Coast Guard Bureau
under control of the State Council’s Ministry of Public
Security, as a unified body consisting of the China Marine
Surveillance (Haijian) of the State Oceanic Administration
under the Ministry of Natural Resources, the China
Fisheries Law Enforcement Command (Yuzheng) of
the Fisheries Management Bureau under the Ministry of
Agriculture, the Maritime Anti-Smuggling Force of the
General Administration of Customs, etc. In July 2018,
the Coast Guard was transferred to the PAP under unified
control and command of the CMC and renamed PAP
Coast Guard. After the transfer, former naval officers were
reportedly given major Coast Guard posts, indicating
enhanced cooperation between the military and Coast
Guard. It has been noted that retired naval destroyers and
frigates were delivered to the Coast Guard, suggesting
that the military has been supporting the Coast Guard in
terms of equipment as well as personnel.
At a ceremony to give the PAP a flag in January 2018,
Chairman Xi stated that the PAP would be incorporated
into the military forces’ joint operations system. It has
been pointed out that the military forces and the Coast
Guard have conducted joint exercises. The military forces
and the PAP including the Coast Guard are believed to be
attempting to steadily strengthen their joint operational
capabilities through the enhancement of cooperation.
Given these trends, progress in cooperation between the
Coast Guard and the Navy and between the Coast Guard
and military services other than the Navy should be
watched closely.
Amid such a situation, in June 2020, “Law of the

provincial government, adjacent to the South China Sea,
ordered the building of 84 large militia fishing vessels
with reinforced hulls and ammunition storage, which the
militia received by the end of 2016, along with extensive
subsidies to encourage frequent operations in the Spratly
Islands. Since this maritime militia unit recruits military
veterans as its members to create a unit on par with a
career soldier unit, it is reported that salary is paid
separately from its commercial fishing activities.[14]

Given the China’s emphasis on the necessity of “fully
exerting the overall power of the military, police and
militia” on the seas, attention should be paid to these
asymmetrical forces, too.

**(5) Air Forces**
China’s air forces consist mainly of the Navy’s air units
and the Air Force. As for fourth-generation fighters,
China has introduced from Russia the Su-27 and Su-30
and the Su-35 latest fourth-generation fighter. China is
also developing its own domestic modern fighters. China
has started the mass production of the J-11B fighter,
a suspected copy of the Su-27, and the J-16 fighter, a
suspected copy of the Su-30, as well as the domestic
J-10 fighter. The J-15 fighter aboard the aircraft carrier
“Liaoning” is viewed as a copy of the Russian Su-33.
China has also reportedly begun to deploy the J-20
fifth-generation fighter and been developing the J-31. It
has been pointed out that the J-31 fighter could be the
base for developing the replacement for the J-15 carrierbased fighter.


As China is continuing the modernization of its
bombers as well, the Air Force has increased the number
of H-6 bombers, which are believed to be capable of
carrying long-range land-attack cruise missiles with
nuclear capability. In an attempt to improve bombers’
long-range operation capabilities, the Air Force has
reportedly begun to operate H-6N bombers that can take
advantage of aerial refueling to fly longer. It is believed
to be developing a new long-range stealth bomber called

actively exported. In fact, it is suggested that the Chinese
Air Force has created a UAV unit for attack missions
and frequently used UAVs for reconnaissance and other
purposes in waters and airspace surrounding China. At
the military parade to celebrate the 70th anniversary of
China’s founding in October 2019, the GJ-11 known as
a stealth attack UAV and the WZ-8 claimed to be a highaltitude, high-speed reconnaissance UAV were displayed
for the first time. It has been noted that China is improving
“Swarm” technology to operate a large number of small
low-cost UAVs.
Given such modernization of the air forces, it is believed
that China is steadily improving not only its defense
capabilities for its national airspace but also capabilities
for conducting combat operations, and supporting ground
and maritime forces in more distant areas.

**(6) Space, Cyber, and Electromagnetic Spectrum**
**Capabilities**

Information gathering, and command and
communication in the military sector have increasingly
relied on satellites and computer networks. As such,
China stated that “outer space and cyberspace have
become new commanding heights (capture point) in
strategic competition among all parties,” indicating that
it has recognized the importance of taking on information
mastery in wartime when it must protect its own
information systems and networks while neutralizing
those of its adversaries In fact the PLASSF established

H-20. It is also pointed out that China is developing an
air-launched ballistic missile with nuclear capability to
be carried by such bombers, and a stealth fighter bomber.
China is also making continuous efforts to improve
capabilities which are essential for operations of modern
air power by introducing the H-6U and IL-78M aerial
refueling tankers and the KJ-500 and KJ-2000 early
warning and control aircraft. Since July 2016, China has
promoted the deployment of the indigenously developed
Y-20 large transport aircraft, which has reportedly
become a base for developing aerial refueling tankers and
other mission support aircraft.
China is rapidly developing a variety of domestic
unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs), including high-altitude,
long-endurance (HALE) UAVs for reconnaissance
and other purposes as well as those capable of carrying
weapons such as missiles Some of these are deployed and

at the end of 2015 apparently takes charge of outer
space, cyberspace, and electronic warfare missions for
intelligence support for all military forces.
In its white paper titled “China’s Space Activities”
and released in December 2016, China does not rule out
its use of outer space for military purposes. Given that
administrative organizations and state-owned enterprises
involved in the use of outer space in China are pointed
out as having close cooperative ties with the military,
it is considered that China is planning to improve its
capabilities for military operations in outer space.[15] China
is said to have developed its space program in the shortest
time in the world. Specifically, China has rapidly
increased the number of satellites available for military
purposes in recent years. For example, the “BeiDou”
global satellite positioning system, which is called a
Chinese-version GPS and pointed out as available for
ballistic missiles and other guided weapons systems,
started its global operation service in late 2018, and it

is deemed that the launch of all satellites constituting
the BeiDou system was completed in June 2020.
Moreover, China is thought to be developing weapons
including anti-satellite weapons using missiles and
laser equipment, as well as killer satellites, in order to
restrict and interfere with the use of space-based assets
by adversaries in wartime.[16]

As for the cyber domain, China sees cybersecurity
as a serious national security threat it faces and vows
that China’s armed forces will build cyber defense
capabilities, reinforce national cyber border defense,
immediately find and block crackers, secure information
network security, and unshakably protect national cyber
sovereignty, information security, and social stability.[17]
It has been noted that current major military exercises
always contain cyber operations covering both attacks
on and defense of command systems. Cyber attacks on
enemy networks are likely to bolster China’s “A2/AD”
capabilities. The militia as a part of China’s armed forces
reportedly includes “cyber militias” with excellent cyber
domain capabilities.
It has also been pointed out that the Chinese military
routinely conducts various force-on-force exercises in an
electronic warfare environment. In addition, the presence
of aircraft with electronic warfare capabilities has been
noted. Y-8 electronic warfare aircraft, which frequently
fly near Japan, are pointed out along with J-15 carrierbased fighters, J-16 fighters and H-6 bombers that appear
to be equipped with electronic warfare pod systems
giving them electronic warfare capabilities.

**(7) Efforts to Develop Joint Operational Capabilities**
In recent years, initiatives have been under way to
improve joint operational capabilities in areas from
the front line to logistics. The CMC Joint Operations
Command Center is believed to have been established
under the initiatives for the CCP to carry out decision
making at the highest strategic level. The five new theaters
established in February 2016 are seen as representing
permanent joint operation headquarters. Given that the
Navy’s Vice-Admiral Yuan Yubai became the first nonArmy theater commander in January 2017, it is assumed
that progress is being made towards joint operations in
the area of human resources. In recent years, China has
implemented tri-service joint exercises giving priority to
practicality and other drills to improve its joint operational
capabilities. These drills are apparently designed to secure
the effectiveness of the abovementioned organizational
reforms and other initiatives to improve joint operational
capabilities. In response to the novel coronavirus disease,


which emerged in China from late 2019, China has
reportedly implemented not only joint military operations
but also the mobilization of civil resources. The Joint
Logistics Support Force specialized in logistics has
played a core military role in the response while receiving
support from each theater and service. In addition,
militias and national-defense-mobilized personnel have
also reportedly participated in the response, which has
attracted attention as a case indicating comprehensive
joint logistic support capabilities.
At the 19th CCP National Congress in October
2017, General Secretary Xi reiterated enhancing joint
operational capabilities and the pursuit of practical
capabilities of a military that “can fight and win a war.”
More recently, at a CMC meeting on military training
in November 2020, General Secretary Xi also stated
that the strengthening and developing of joint training
and the enhancement of joint operational capabilities
need to be accelerated. Given these remarks, the
abovementioned moves towards joint operations are
expected to progress further.

**6 Maritime and Airspace Activities**


**Chapter**


**(1) General Situation**
Recently, China is believed to be aiming to build up
capabilities for operations in more distant waters and
airspace, including those to project power to waters
including the so-called second island chain, beyond
the first island chain. In such efforts, China has rapidly
expanded and intensified its activities in the maritime and
aerial domains using its naval and air powers. In waters
and airspace surrounding Japan, particularly, Chinese
naval vessels, and naval and air force aircraft suspected
as conducting training and information gathering
activities have been observed frequently, along with
Chinese naval ships heading for the Pacific and Indian
Ocean and numerous China Coast Guard vessels and
aircraft operating under the name of protecting maritime
interests. Their activities include China Coast Guard
vessels’ intermittent intrusions into Japan’s territorial
waters, Chinese aircraft’s intrusions into Japan’s
airspace, and dangerous acts that could cause unintended
consequences, such as the directing of fire-control
radar at Japanese Self-Defense Forces (SDF) ships and
aircraft, Chinese military fighter jets’ abnormally close
approach to Japanese SDF and U.S. military aircraft,
and the establishment of the “East China Sea ADIZ” and
other activities that could infringe upon the freedom of
overflight. These activities have become a grave matter


16 According to “The Worldwide Threat Assessment,” the U.S. Director of National Intelligence (2019)

of concern and are very deplorable. In the South China
Sea, China is moving forward with militarization, and
expanding and intensifying its activities in the maritime
and aerial domains, attempting to create a fait accompli
for unilaterally changing the status quo by coercion.
It is strongly hoped that China will act on the basis of
the principle of the rule of law and play active roles in
the region and the international community in a more
cooperative manner.

**(2) Military Activities in Japan’s Surrounding Waters**
**and Airspace**

The Chinese Navy and Air Force have in recent
years expanded and intensified their activities in the
surrounding sea areas and airspace of Japan, including
the area surrounding the Senkaku Islands. These activities
include those allegedly based on China’s unilateral claim
on the Senkaku Islands, and cases involving the onesided escalation of activities, creating a situation of great
concern to Japan. The Air Self-Defense Force (ASDF) has
continued to make frequent scrambles against Chinese
aircraft, as indicated by an all-time high of 851 scrambles
in FY2016. China has also continued naval ships’ passage
through waters near Japan for navigation to distant waters
such as the Indian Ocean, as well as activities viewed
as training of maritime and air forces making forays to
the Pacific and the Sea of Japan. Although China can be
suspected of intending to “regularize” these activities,
there is a view that China is attempting to take advantage
of the “regularization” to alleviate concerns over these
activities.[18] At the same time, it appears that China
continues to improve the complexity of its activities.
Given that Chinese efforts are also seen to improve
practical joint operational capabilities, Chinese military
activities in Japan’s surrounding waters and airspace
should be closely watched with grave attention.
a. Activities in the East China Sea (including the Areas
around the Senkaku Islands)
Chinese naval vessels have been conducting operations
in the East China Sea continuously and actively. Stating
its own position regarding Japan’s Senkaku Islands,
China claims that patrols by Chinese naval vessels
in the sea areas under its jurisdiction are completely
justifiable and lawful. Chinese naval vessels have been
continuously operating in the areas near Japan’s Senkaku
Islands. In June 2016, a Jiangkai I-class frigate became
the first ever Chinese Navy combatant vessel to enter
Japan’s contiguous zone around the Senkaku Islands.
Furthermore, in January 2018, a Shang-class submerged
submarine and a Jiangkai II-class frigate passed into
the contiguous zone around the Senkaku Islands on the


same day. This was the first time a submerged Chinese
submarine was identified and announced as transiting
through the contiguous waters off the Senkaku Islands.
In June 2020, submerged transit of a submarine presumed
to belong to China was confirmed in the contiguous zone
surrounding Amami Oshima Island. In recent years,
Chinese Navy intelligence gathering vessels (AGIs) have
also been found conducting activities in multiple cases. A
Chinese Navy Dongdiao-class AGI repeatedly navigated
back and forth outside of the contiguous zone south of the
Senkaku Islands in November 2015. In June 2016, an AGI
of the same type sailed in Japan’s territorial waters near
Kuchinoerabujima Island and Yakushima Island, and then
passed Japan’s contiguous zone north of Kitadaitojima
Island. Subsequently, the vessel repeatedly conducted
east-west passages outside the contiguous zone south of
the Senkaku Islands. This was the first navigation by a
Chinese Navy vessel in Japanese territorial waters in the
approximately 12 years since 2004.
China’s air forces are also actively conducting
activities in the East China Sea on a routine basis. Their
activities are thought to include warning and surveillance,
combat air patrols (CAPs), and training. Chinese military
aircraft have recently become more active in airspace
closer to Japan’s Southwestern Islands. Their activities
have possibly been intended to operate the “East China
Sea ADIZ.” In April 2018, an alleged Chinese BZK-005
unmanned reconnaissance vehicle was identified flying
over the East China Sea. Furthermore, Chinese military
aircraft have been confirmed as operating in airspace
close to the Senkaku Islands in recent years.
b. Advancements into the Pacific Ocean
Chinese Navy combatant vessels continue to transit
the waters near Japan to advance into the Pacific
Ocean and return to base with high frequency. The
advancement routes are multiplying. Chinese naval
vessels have been confirmed as transiting the sea area
between the main island of Okinawa and Miyakojima
Island, and have been found passing through the Osumi
Strait, the sea area between Yonagunijima Island and
Nakanokamishima Island near Iriomotejima Island, the
sea area between Amamioshima Island and Yokoatejima
Island, the Tsugaru Strait, and the Soya Strait. Through
these activities, China has apparently attempted to
“regularize” naval ships’ advancements into the Pacific
Ocean through waters near Japan and improve its
capabilities for accessing the open ocean and conducting
operations there. In December 2016, the aircraft carrier
“Liaoning” navigated the East China Sea together with
other vessels and passed the sea area between the main
island of Okinawa and Miyakojima Island to advance to


**Chapter**


-----

the Pacific for the first time. In April 2018, the Chinese
Ministry of National Defense announced that the aircraft
carrier “Liaoning” and multiple other vessels passed
through the Bashi Channel to advance to the Pacific and
conducted force-on-force exercises that included carrierbased fighters. At that time, the Japanese Maritime
Self-Defense Force (MSDF), conducting warning and
surveillance, confirmed for the first time the carrier used
for what were presumed to be carrier-based fighters for
take-off and landing in the Pacific Ocean. Moreover,
the aircraft carrier “Liaoning” advanced to the Pacific
Ocean through the sea area between the main island of
Okinawa and Miyakojima island in June 2019, together
with vessels such as a Fuyu-class fast combat support
ship pointed out to be for supplying the aircraft carrier
group. Furthermore, in April 2020, a fleet, including the
aircraft carrier “Liaoning,” passed through the waters of
the main island of Okinawa and Miyakojima island to
enter the Pacific Ocean, and deployed through the Bashi
Strait to the South China Sea. Later, the fleet again passed
through the Bashi Strait and entered the Pacific Ocean.
Within the same month it passed through the waters of
the main island of Okinawa and Miyakojima island to
the East China Sea. In addition, in April 2021, a fleet
including aircraft carrier “Liaoning” and the Renhaiclass destroyer were seen passing through the waters
of the main island of Okinawa and Miyakojima Island
southward to the Pacific Ocean, and then within the same
month navigated northward through the same sea area to
the East China Sea. Also, in the voyages that took place
in April 2020 and April 2021, carrier-based fighters have
been confirmed taking-off and landing in the Pacific.
The activities are worthy of attention as indicating the
enhancement of the capabilities of China’s naval forces,
including the aircraft carrier, and the improvement of its
capabilities to project power to more distant areas.
Regarding air forces, the advancement of a PLAN Y-8
early warning aircraft into the Pacific Ocean, passing
between the main island of Okinawa and Miyakojima
Island, was confirmed for the first time in July 2013.
The advancement of Air Force aircraft into the Pacific
was also confirmed in 2015. Since 2017, advances into
the Pacific Ocean via this airspace have become more
active. The types of aircraft passing through the airspace
have also diversified year by year. H-6K bombers and
Su-30 fighters were confirmed by 2016 and the Y-8 EW
aircraft in July 2017. At least one bomber was confirmed
as carrying objects in the form of missiles. The U.S.
DoD has pointed out that such Chinese bomber flights
indicated the Chinese forces’ training targeting the United
States and its allies.[19] Flight patterns of Chinese military


aircraft have also been changing. Flights from the East
China Sea to the Pacific Ocean, passing between the main
island of Okinawa and Miyakojima Island, and from the
direction of the Bashi Channel to the Pacific Ocean, both
with the return trips on the same shuttle routes, have been
repeatedly made. Since November 2016, H-6K bombers
and other aircraft were confirmed as flying around
Taiwan. In August 2017, H-6K bombers were confirmed
as flying to waters off the Kii Peninsula after advancing
to the Pacific Ocean via waters between the main island
of Okinawa and Miyakojima Island for the first time.
Through frequent long-distance flights of bombers and
other aircraft, including advancements to the Pacific,
and their advanced flight paths and composition, China
is thought to be demonstrating its presence around areas
including those surrounding Japan, and planning further
enhancements to more practical operational capabilities.
Additionally, activities considered planned to improve
sea and air joint operational capabilities in more distant
areas, such as what seemed to be air-to-ship attack drills
including advancements to the Pacific Ocean, have been
seen in recent years. In April 2019 and February 2020,
the PLA Eastern Theater Command announced that joint
training was conducted in waters east of Taiwan. China
is expected to further expand and intensify naval and air
activities in the Pacific Ocean.
c. Activities in the Sea of Japan
While the Chinese Navy has been active in the Sea of
Japan during training and on other occasions for some
time, its Air Force activities in the area have also
intensified of late. “Force-on-force exercises” in the Sea
of Japan by Chinese Navy ships were announced for
the first time in August 2016. Three aircraft apparently
participated in the exercises, including two H-6 bombers
that passed through the Tsushima Strait into the Sea of
Japan for the first time.
In December 2017, Chinese Air Force aircraft (H-6K
bombers) passed through the Tsushima Strait and
advanced to the Sea of Japan. Then, Chinese fighter
aircraft (Su-30 fighters) were confirmed as advancing to
the Sea of Japan for the first time. In February 2018, it
was confirmed for the first time that the Y-9 intelligence
gathering aircraft entered the Sea of Japan via the Western
Channel of Tsushima Strait (the strait between Tsushima
in Nagasaki Prefecture and the Korean Peninsula).
Since 2018, China’s sea and air forces have further
intensified activities in the Sea of Japan involving
passages through the Tsushima Strait. It is considered
that the PLA will continue to expand and intensify its
activities in the Sea of Japan.

posture intended to use Coast Guard vessels to intrude
into Japan’s territorial waters. Specifically, vessels sent
to waters near the Senkaku Islands have grown larger
in size. At least one of the vessels intruding into Japan’s
territorial waters has been a 3,000-ton or larger vessel
since August 2014. Since February 2015, three 3,000-ton
or larger vessels have been confirmed as entering Japan’s
territorial waters simultaneously. Since December of
the same year, Chinese ships armed with what appear to
be cannons have repeatedly intruded into the Japanese
territorial waters.
Cases indicating the improvement of China Coast
Guard vessels’ operational capabilities have been also
confirmed. From April to August 2020, China Coast
Guard vessels were seen in the contiguous zone of the
Senkaku Islands for a record 111 consecutive days. In
that year, the number of days when China Coast Guard
vessels were seen in the contiguous zone of the Senkaku
Islands hit an all-time high of 333. The total number of
China Coast Guard vessels seen in the zone also reached
an all-time high of 1,161.
Additionally, cases indicating China’s capabilities
to send numerous China Coast Guard vessels and
other ships to waters around the Senkaku Islands
simultaneously have also been identified. In early August
2016, approximately 200 to 300 Chinese fishing boats
advanced to the contiguous zone of the Senkaku Islands.
At that time, as many as up to 15 China Coast Guard
vessels and other ships were confirmed in the contiguous
zone simultaneously. Over five days, a large number of
China Coast Guard vessels, other ships, and fishing boats
repeatedly intruded into Japan’s territorial waters.
In December 2012, a fixed-wing aircraft of the
State Oceanic Administration was identified as the first
Chinese aircraft to intrude into Japan’s airspace around
the Senkaku Islands. Until March 2014, aircraft of the
State Oceanic Administration were frequently confirmed
as approaching the airspace. In May 2017, it was
confirmed that an object that appeared to be a small drone
was flying above a China Coast Guard vessel intruding
into the Japanese territorial waters around the Senkaku
Islands. This flight also constitutes an invasion of Japan’s
territorial airspace.
China has thus relentlessly continued attempts to
unilaterally change the status quo by coercion in the
sea area around the Senkaku Islands, leading to a grave
matter of concern. Japan cannot accept China’s actions to
escalate the situation.
Among waters other than those around the Senkaku
Islands, China Coast Guard vessels were confirmed as
passing through the territorial waters of Japan around
Tsushima Island (Nagasaki Prefecture), Okinoshima
Island (Fukuoka Prefecture) and the Tsugaru Strait in

**(3) Activities of Chinese Ships Including Coast**
**Guard Vessels, and Aircraft around the Senkaku**
**Islands, etc.**

China Coast Guard vessels have been seen almost every
day in the contiguous zone of the Senkaku Islands, Japan’s
inherent territory, and repeatedly intruded into Japan’s
territorial waters. Since the activities of China Coast
Guard vessels based on China’s own assertion conducted
in Japan’s territorial waters around the Senkaku Islands
are violating international law in the first place, Japan
has been strongly protesting against these activities and
requested them to leave many times. Despite Japan’s
strong protests, however, they continued to intrude into
the Japanese territorial waters in FY2020. In May, July,
August, October, November, December 2020 as well as
in January, February, March, April, and May 2021, China
Coast Guard vessels entered Japan’s territorial waters and
attempted to approach Japanese fishing boats, which were
navigating in the area. Among these incidents, China
Coast Guard vessels entered Japan’s territorial waters
around the Senkaku Islands and stayed there for more
than 57 hours, the longest period ever, in October 2020.
Providing the background, in December 2008, China
Maritime Surveillance vessels intruded into Japan’s
territorial waters for the first time and hovered and
drifted, running counter to international law. Later,
China Maritime Surveillance and China Fisheries Law
Enforcement Command vessels gradually intensified
their activities in the Japanese territorial waters. Such
activities have intensified greatly since September 2012,
when the Japanese Government acquired the ownership
of three of the Senkaku Islands (Uotsurishima Island,
Kitakojima Island, and Minamikojima Island). The
number of Chinese government ships intruding into the
Japanese territorial waters in a day had been limited
to two or three until August 2016. Later, however, the
number has reached four frequently.

**(4) Trends of Activities in the South China Sea**

China has also been intensifying its activities based
on assertions, which are conflicting with existing laws
and orders of the seas, in the South China Sea, including
waters around the Spratly Islands and the Paracel Islands,
over which territorial disputes exist with neighbors,
including some member states of the Association of
Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN).
Since 2014, on seven features of the Spratly Islands
(Fiery Cross Reef, Mischief Reef, Subi Reef, Cuarteron
Reef, Gaven Reefs, Hughes Reef, and Johnson South
Reef), China pressed ahead with large-scale and rapid
land reclamation. The Philippines-China arbitration
award issued in July 2016 denied the “historic rights”
as the basis of the “nine-dash line” claimed by China,
and determined the illegality of China’s activities such
as land reclamation. However, China has made it clear
that it would not comply with the award and is currently
continuing military activities while promoting the
development of military facilities, such as batteries,
and various kinds of infrastructure that can be used for
military purposes, including runways, ports, hangars, and
radar facilities, to militarize these features.
On Fiery Cross, Subi and Mischief Reefs, called the
Big Three of the Spratly Islands, China has developed


July 2017. The same vessels were also confirmed to
have sailed in Japan’s territorial waters from Sata Cape
to the Kusagaki Islands (both in Kagoshima Prefecture)
in August that year. In July 2019, a China Coast Guard
vessel was seen sailing in Japan’s territorial waters around
Tappisaki and Omasaki (both in Aomori Prefecture).

batteries for anti-aircraft guns, missile shelters,
underground storage facilities pointed out to be munitions
storage, large ports capable of accommodating combatant
ships and runways available for takeoff and landing of
fighters and bombers.
On Fiery Cross Reef in April 2016, a Navy patrol
aircraft flying over the South China Sea landed for a
nominal purpose of evacuating emergency patients. On
Subi and Mischief Reefs in July of the same year, China
forced aircraft test flights on runways available for the
takeoff and landing of large aircraft. Reportedly, a Y-7
transport aircraft was confirmed on Mischief Reef in
January 2018, a Y-8 special mission aircraft on Subi Reef
in April that year, and Y-20 transport airport on Fiery
Cross Reef in December 2020. Additionally, in April
2018, it was reported that anti-ship cruise missiles and
surface-to-air missiles were deployed on Fiery Cross,
Subi and Mischief Reefs for military training and that
radar jamming systems were deployed on Mischief Reef.
Furthermore, it was reported in May 2020 that China
possibly deployed aircraft including Y-8 patrol and Y-9
early warning aircraft and other aircraft to the Fiery Cross
Reef in rotation.
On the other four features, it is pointed out that the
construction of facilities, such as harbors, helipads, and
radars, has made progress and that what appears to be
large anti-aircraft guns and close in weapon systems
(CIWS) may have already been deployed. If these
features are used for full-scale military purposes, it could
significantly change the security environment in the
Indo-Pacific region.
China carried out the militarization of the Paracel
Islands before that of the Spratly Islands. China has
reportedly extended the runway to nearly 3,000 m on
Woody Island since 2013. In October 2015, October 2017,
and June 2019, China was reported to have deployed
J-11, J-10 and other fighters on the island. In February
2016 and January 2017, the existence of equipment
likely to be surface-to-air missiles was confirmed. It has
been noted that the takeoff and landing training of the
H-6K bombers in the South China Sea announced by the
Chinese Ministry of National Defense in May 2018 was
carried out on Woody Island.
In recent years, Chinese vessels have allegedly been
conducting what are likely to be survey activities in
Scarborough Shoal, where a standoff took place between
Chinese and Philippine government ships in April
2012. It is pointed out that new land reclamations on
the shoal might be seen in the future.[20] It is also pointed
out that if China conducts land reclamations and installs
radar facilities, runways, and other infrastructure on


Scarborough Shoal, it could possibly increase its ability
for situation awareness and power projection capabilities
in the surrounding sea area and ultimately enhance its
operational capabilities throughout all the areas of the
South China Sea. Attention must continue to be paid to
the situation going forward.
The activities in sea and airspace are expanding and
intensifying as well. In March 2009, December 2013
and September 2018, Chinese naval and other vessels
approached and intercepted U.S. Navy vessels navigating
in the South China Sea. In May 2016, February 2017
and May 2017, PLA fighters allegedly flew close to
U.S. Forces aircraft. In July and August 2016, after
the Philippines-China arbitration award was rendered,
PLAAF H-6K bomber aircraft conducted “combat air
patrol” in the airspace close to Scarborough Shoal. The
Chinese Ministry of National Defense announced that this
patrol would “become normal.” In December 2016, H-6
bombers reportedly flew along the so-called nine-dash
line. In September of the same year, the China-Russia
bilateral naval exercise “Joint Sea 2016” was conducted
for the first time in the South China Sea.
A field training exercise by naval vessels including the
aircraft carrier “Liaoning” and a naval review ceremony,
regarded as the largest since the founding of China, were
conducted in the same area from the end of March until
April 2018. In 2019, anti-ship ballistic missile tests were
reportedly conducted in the South China Sea for the first
time. In 2019 and in April 2020, the deployment of the
aircraft carrier “Liaoning” accompanied by Fuyu-class
fast combat support and other ships in the South China
Sea was reported. Furthermore, China Coast Guard
vessels reportedly fired warning shots at fishing boats of
neighboring countries. When China Coast Guard vessels
interrupted Vietnam’s oil and natural gas development
within its exclusive economic zone from July to October
2019, they reportedly visited Fiery Cross Reef for supply.
In April 2020, China unilaterally announced the
establishment of Xisha (Paracel) District and Nansha
(Spratly) District under Sansha City in the Hainan
province. China conducted simultaneous military
exercises in three sea areas (South China Sea, East
China Sea, and Yellow Sea) in July and is believed to
have launched middle-range ballistic missiles in August
2020. In this way, it appears that China seeks to expand
its presence and enhance war-sustaining and other joint
operational capabilities including military and other
means in the South China Sea.
Such activities conducted by China based on its own
assertions, which are conflicting with existing laws and
orders of the seas, unilaterally change the status quo

**(5) Trends in the Indian Ocean and Other More Distant**
**Waters**

The Chinese Navy is considered to be shifting towards
“protection missions on the far seas” and has been
steadily increasing its capabilities to conduct operations
in more distant waters, such as the Indian Ocean, in
recent years. Progress has been seen in the Navy’s
development of such equipment as large combatant ships
and replenishment ships and in its operational initiatives.
For example, since December 2008, Chinese Navy
vessels have been deployed off the coast of Somalia and
in the Gulf of Aden to take part in international counterpiracy efforts. In December 2019, the Chinese Navy
conducted its first multilateral exercise with its Russian
and Iranian counterparts in the northern Indian Ocean.
Activities of Chinese Navy submarines have also been
confirmed continuously in the Indian Ocean. They have
been reported to make port calls at Sri Lanka’s Colombo,
Pakistan’s Karachi, and Malaysia’s Kota Kinabalu. In
January 2020, China reportedly sent a submarine for


and further advance its efforts to create a fait accompli.
Japan is deeply concerned about these activities, and
the concern is shared with the international community,
including the United States and other G7 Member States.
For example, in July 2020, the United States released a
U.S. Secretary of State’s statement stating that China’s
maritime claims in the South China Sea were unlawful.
China asserts that some of the ASEAN member states
including the Philippines and Vietnam are illegitimately
occupying features. However, China’s development
work on the features is of a scale incomparable to the
activities carried out by other countries and is conducted
at a rapid pace.[21]

In any case, the issues surrounding the South China
Sea are directly related to peace and stability in the IndoPacific region and are a legitimate concern not only for
Japan, which has major sea lanes in the South China Sea,
but also for the entire international community. Countries
concerned, including China, are urged to refrain from
unilateral actions that heighten tension and act on the

**(6) Objectives of Activities in Waters and Airspace**
The development and activities of Chinese naval and
air forces, descriptions in defense white papers, China’s
geographical conditions and globalizing economy, and
other factors indicate that the recent water and airspace
activities of the Navy, Air Force and other Chinese
organizations have the following objectives:
The first is to intercept operations by adversaries in
waters and airspace as far as possible from China in
order to defend its territorial land, waters and airspace.
Behind this objective is an increase in the effectiveness
of long-range attacks due to recent progress in science
and technology.
The second is to develop capabilities to deter and
prevent Taiwan’s independence. China maintains that
it will not allow any foreign intervention in solving the
Taiwan issue and realizing the unification of China.
To ensure the prevention of foreign intervention in the
Taiwan issue, China needs to enhance its operational
capabilities at sea and airspace as Taiwan is surrounded
by the sea in all directions.
The third is to weaken the control of other countries on
islands subject to China’s territorial claims and enhance
the claims through various surveillance activities and use
of force in waters and airspace surrounding these islands.
Such activities are considered to also have the purpose
of creating a fait accompli as part of the reasons for
unilaterally changing the status quo and justifying China’s
claims based on its own concept of “legal warfare.”
The fourth is to acquire, maintain, and protect its
maritime rights and interests. China is engaged in oil and
gas drilling as well as building facilities and surveying
in the East and South China Seas. It has been confirmed
that in addition to the existing four platforms, China has
built 12 additional offshore platforms on the Chinese side
of the Japan-China median line of the East China Sea
since June 2013. In late June 2016, the installment of an
anti-surface vessel radar and a surveillance camera was
confirmed on one of the platforms. Attention is to be paid
to matters regarding the platforms, including the purpose
of such equipment. Japan has repeatedly lodged protests


2016, China-Russia “Joint Sea” bilateral naval exercises
took place in waters including the Mediterranean Sea.
In November 2019, the Chinese Navy conducted its first
multilateral exercises with its Russian and South African
counterparts in waters around the Cape of Good Hope.
China has also deployed a space observation support ship
in the southern Pacific and dispatched a military hospital
ship to waters including the southern Pacific as well as
those near Latin America under “Mission Harmony.”
In September 2015, five Chinese military vessels
reportedly sailed in the high seas of the Bering Sea
and in U.S. territorial waters near the Aleutian Islands.
Moreover, in January 2018, China published a white
paper entitled “China’s Arctic Policy,” which mapped
out a policy of active involvement in Arctic initiatives,
including efforts to build a “Polar Silk Road” through
the development of Arctic sea routes. It is pointed out
that China could take advantage of scientific survey and
commercial activities to increase its presence including
military activities in the Arctic sea.[22]

Additionally, China has been remarkably trying to
secure overseas outposts such as harbors, which would
help support its operations in far seas. For example, in
August 2017, China began to operate a “support base”
for logistics support of the PLA in Djibouti, a strategic
point in Eastern Africa facing the Gulf of Aden. Since
April 2018, a pier viewed as potentially accommodating
large replenishment ships has been under construction
on the “support base” coast. Moreover, it is pointed
out that in addition to Djibouti, China is potentially
considering and planning military logistics facilities
overseas.[23] In recent years, China has been promoting its
“Belt and Road” Initiative (BRI) whose main purpose is
advertised as establishing an economic zone in regions
including the Eurasian continent, with the Chinese
military possibly taking on the role of the shield behind
the initiative by such means as the stabilization of areas
via counter-piracy activities and the improvement of
counter-terrorism capabilities in coastal states through
bilateral and multilateral exercises. While it is thought
that the initiative includes a strategic intention to expand
its influence in the region, it is possible that the initiative
will further improve the PLA’s operational capabilities
in the Indian Ocean, Pacific Ocean and elsewhere. For
example, China’s support for the construction of port
infrastructure in Pakistan, Sri Lanka, Bangladesh and
other Indian Ocean countries as well as Pacific island
countries including Vanuatu could lead China to secure
outposts available for its military purposes.


**Chapter**


**Key Words** **“Belt and Road” Initiative**

A concept for an economic sphere proposed by President Xi Jinping. The
“Silk Road Economic Belt” (“One Belt”) and the “21st Century Maritime
Silk Road” (“One Road”) were announced in September and October 2013,
respectively. Since then, the two concepts are collectively referred to as the
“Belt and Road” Initiative.

against China’s unilateral development and demanded
the termination of such work.
The fifth is to defend its sea lanes of communications.
In the background is the fact that its sea lanes, including
its oil transportation routes from the Middle East, are
essential for the Chinese economy. Given the recent
strengthening of the Chinese Navy and Air Force, it
is believed that they have been expanding military
capabilities to cover distant waters beyond China’s
near seas.
Given these objectives of China’s water and airspace
activities and recent trends, it is believed that China plans
to further expand the sphere of its activities, and further
intensify its operations in waters surrounding Japan,
including the East China Sea and the Pacific Ocean, as
well as in the South China Sea and the Indian Ocean.
Meanwhile, in recent years, China has shown
interest in taking steps to avoid and prevent unexpected
contingencies in sea areas and airspace. For example, in
April 2014, China, together with other countries such
as Japan and the United States, adopted the Code for
Unplanned Encounters at Sea (CUES), which sets forth the
standards of behavior in the case that the naval vessels or
aircraft of the Western Pacific Naval Symposium (WPNS)
member states have unexpected encounters. Also, in June
2018, Japan and China started the implementation of their
Maritime and Air Communication Mechanism between
the Defense Authorities to avoid unexpected collisions
between SDF and PLA vessels and aircraft.

**7 International Military Activities**


has remained the second largest, after the U.S. share,
since 2016.
Moreover, China has been actively participating in
counter-piracy activities off the coast of Somalia and
in the Gulf of Aden as well as humanitarian assistance
and disaster relief activities. In 2011, in view of the
deteriorating situation in Libya, China carried out a
military evacuation of Chinese nationals for the first time.
It is pointed out that factors behind such Chinese
attitude include the growing need for protecting and
promoting China’s national interests overseas following
the expansion of national interests beyond its national
borders, China’s attempt to verify military capabilities
including units’ long-distance deployment, its intent
to raise its status by demonstrating its will to fulfill its
responsibilities to the international community, its hope
to diffuse the military’s peaceful and humanitarian
images, and its attempt to enhance relations with PKO
regions including African countries.

**8 Education and Training**


**Chapter**


In recent years, the PLA under the policy of building
a military that “can fight and win a war” has promoted
practical exercises including large-scale ones such as
joint exercises led by theater commands, force-on-force
exercises, landing exercises, inter-theater exercises, and
large exercises including distant ones, as well as nighttime exercises and joint exercises with other countries,
in order to strengthen its operational capabilities. The
new military training regulations in effect since January
2018 referred to the execution of joint and full-spectrum
operation based on network information systems, in
addition to the definite implementation of practical
training as a principle. Moreover, the trial regulation on
the supervision of military training that took effect in
March 2019 is regarded as China’s first attempt to put
in place a system that prescribes measures for rectifying
practices that are inconsistent with the requirements of
actual combat and criteria for identifying malpractice and
discipline violations during military training.
In the education spectrum as well, the PLA aims
to train soldiers who have the ability to execute joint
operations. In 2003, it launched a human resource
strategy project to develop human resources capable
of directing joint and informatized operations, and
of building joint and informatized armed forces. It
was reported in 2017 that the PLA National Defense
University began training to develop human resources
capable of directing joint operations.
China outlined the promotion of the “rule of law”
at the fourth plenary session of the 18th CCP Central
Committee in 2014 with Chairman Xi referring to the


In recent years, the PLA has been indicating its positive
attitude on nontraditional security missions such as
peacekeeping, humanitarian assistance and disaster
relief, and counterpiracy, dispatching numerous units for
such overseas missions.
China has vowed to consistently support and actively
participate in UN PKO, increasing its presence in UN
PKO. China, for the first time, released a white paper
regarding its involvement in UN PKO in September
2020 titled “China’s Armed Forces: 30 Years of UN
Peacekeeping Operations.” According this white paper,
China has sent more than 40,000 military personnel on
25 missions of UN PKO. According to the UN, as of
the end of December 2020, China had a total of 2,520
troops, civilian police and military observers — the
largest number of peacekeepers among the permanent
members of the UN Security Council — engaged in UN
peacekeeping activities, including the United Nations
Multidimensional Integrated Stabilization Mission in
Mali (MINUSMA). China has also largely increased
its share of the UN PKO budget The Chinese share

military as being controlled by law, indicating that the
PLA is required to thoroughly implement the “rule of
law.” In another development for the indication, Miao
Hua, Director of the Political Work Department, and
Zhang Shengmin, Secretary of the Central Commission
for Discipline Inspection, were selected as members
of the 19th Central Military Commission, the supreme
decision-making body in the military. The issuance of the
trial regulation on military supervision work in January
2020 also suggests the rule of law promotion.
China has been developing defense mobilization
systems in order to effectively utilize private resources
in case of emergencies, including wars. It enforced the
National Defense Mobilization Law as the basic law
for defense mobilizations in 2010 and the National
Defense Transportation Law for the transportation area
in 2016. The “civil-military fusion” policy that China is
currently promoting is believed to have its sights set on
the routine military use of civilian resources not only in
emergencies but also in peacetime. The military use of
civilian resources includes civilian ships’ transportation
of military equipment. As such initiative generally
augments China’s forces available for military missions
and is expected to proactively be promoted in the future,
the initiative’s implications for the Chinese military
forces’ operational capabilities should be watched closely.

industry’s arms sales were pointed out as the second
largest after those in the United States in 2017.[24] In
2018, China National Nuclear Corporation and China
Nuclear Engineering & Construction Corporation was
reorganized. After China State Shipbuilding Corporation
merged with China Shipbuilding Industry Corporation
in 2019, the industry now comprises 10 corporations
including China State Shipbuilding Corporation.
While China imports highly sophisticated military
equipment and parts that it cannot produce domestically
from other countries such as Russia, it is believed that
China places emphasis on the enhancement of its military
industrial sector, including the domestic production of
equipment, to modernize its military. It has been pointed
out that China is acquiring technologies ambitiously
not only through domestic technology research and
development and foreign direct investment, but also via
illegal means in the form of secret information theft.[25] The
trend of the national defense industry sector is directly
linked to the modernization of the military and should be
closely watched with strong attention.
China’s civil-military fusion policy has been evident
in the technology area. China promotes two-way
technological exchanges where military technologies
are utilized for developing the national economy while
civilian technologies are absorbed for national defense
development. It also seems interested in absorbing foreign
technologies available both for military and civilian
purposes. It is pointed out that China’s civil-military
fusion policy gives priority to initiatives in seas, outer
space, cyber, AI, and other emerging areas for China.
In recent years, China has reportedly promoted the
standardization of civilian products for their military
adoption from the production stage under the civilmilitary fusion policy. This initiative is expected to allow
the military to more effectively utilize civilian resources.

its influence by leveraging support for the COVID-19
infection countermeasures such as so-called “mask
diplomacy” and “vaccine diplomacy.”

**2 Relations with Russia**


**1 General Situation**

China, particularly regarding maritime issues over which
its interests conflict with others’, continues to demonstrate
its attitude of realizing its unilateral assertions without
compromise, while promoting assertive actions including
those to change the status quo by coercion and create
a fait accompli for such changes, based on its own
assertions incompatible with the existing international
order. China has been promoting its BRI as a national
strategy, but some BRI-participating countries have
recently reconsidering BRI projects due mainly to their
fiscal deterioration. Furthermore, it has been pointed
that there have been moves toward creating China’s
own international order, including the establishment of
China-led multilateral mechanisms in security, financial
to influence political decisions in other countries through
efforts such as winning over foreign politicians.[26]

At the same time, China recognizes that a peaceful
and stable international environment is necessary for
maintaining sustainable economic development and
enhancing China’s overall national power. Based on such
recognition, China has advocated building a “community
of shared future for mankind” and referred to promoting
the building of “a new type of international relations
based on mutual respect, equity and justice, and win–
win cooperation.” China proactively carries out military
exchanges with other countries. In recent years, China
has been engaged in active military exchanges not only
with major powers such as the United States and Russia
and with its neighboring countries including Southeast
Asian countries, but also with countries in Africa and
Latin America. The objectives of China’s promotion of
military exchanges are thought to include alleviating other
countries’ concerns regarding China by strengthening its
relations with these countries, creating a favorable security
environment for China, enhancing China’s influence in
the international community, exploring overseas arms
markets, securing stable supplies of natural resources,
and ensuring foreign bases.
With regard to the COVID-19 infections that emerged
in China, some question China’s initial response and
delay in providing relevant information. In this situation,
there are also views that China is aiming to increase
political and economic interest in its own country,
while strategically working to form an international and
regional order that is advantageous to China and expand


Ever since the so-called China-Soviet confrontation
ended in 1989, China and Russia have placed importance
on their bilateral relationship. They have emphasized
the deepening of their “strategic partnership” since its
establishment in the mid-1990s. In 2001, the ChinaRussia Treaty of Good- Neighborliness and Friendly
Cooperation was concluded. In 2004, the long-standing
issue of border demarcation between the two countries
came to a settlement. The two countries have a common
view on promoting the multipolarization of the world and
the establishment of a new international order and have
further deepened their relations.
On the military front, since the 1990s, China has
purchased modern weapons from Russia, including
fighters, destroyers, and submarines. Russia is currently
the largest supplier of weapons to China.[27] Although
China-Russia arms transactions in value in recent years
have been lower than in some past period, China has
apparently continued to indicate its strong interests in
importing advanced Russian defense equipment and in
joint equipment development with Russia. For example,
China has introduced what are believed to be the latest
fourth generation Su-35 fighters and the S-400 surface-toair missile system from Russia. China has been reported
as the first country to import the Russian S-400 missile
system. At the same time, it is pointed out that Russia has
differentiated the performance of some of the weapons
it exports to China, due to its concerns about China’s
reverse engineering and its policy of not providing China
having a ground border with Russia with sophisticated
weapons that would pose a threat to Russia. It is also
suggested that Russia has concerns about competing with
China in arms exports taking into consideration China’s
improvement of technological power.
Military exchanges between China and Russia take
place in such forms as routine mutual visits by senior
military officers and bilateral and multilateral exercises.
For example, China participated in the Vostok 2018
exercise, viewed as one of the largest Russian military
exercises since the end of the Cold War, the Tsentr-2019
exercise in 2019, and Maneuvers “Kavkaz 2020” in

2020. Additionally, the two countries have held the largescale bilateral naval exercise “Joint Sea” since 2012. The
annual exercise for 2016 took place in the South China for
the first time, and that for 2017 was held in the Baltic Sea
and Sea of Okhotsk for the first time. In 2016 and 2017,
the two countries held the “Aerospace Security” missile
defense computer-simulated exercise. Furthermore,
China has held the counterterrorism exercise “Peace
Mission” between China and Russia or among the member
countries of the Shanghai Cooperation Organization
(SCO), established in June 2001 including Russia. China
likely regards these exchanges as an opportunity to learn
about how to operate Russian-made weapons and the
operational doctrine of the Russian Armed Forces, which
have combat experiences.
In addition, moves indicating deepened China-Russia
relations have been confirmed in recent years. In the
two countries’ “first joint strategic flight” of bombers
in July 2019, their bombers joined in the Sea of Japan
and flew to the East China Sea. In September 2019,
China and Russia signed a series of documents on
cooperation in the military and military technologies.[28]
Similar trends continued in 2020. In December that
year, Russian Defense Minister Sergey Shoigu and
Chinese Defense Minister Wei Fenghe held a video
teleconference and signed a protocol on the extension of
the intergovernmental agreement on mutual notifications
of ballistic missile and carrier rocket launches for 10
years. In the same month, Russian and Chinese bombers
conducted a long-distance joint flight from the Sea of
Japan to the East China Sea and the Pacific Ocean,
and the two countries announced that the flight was
conducted with the goal of deepening and developing
the comprehensive partnership in the new era.

**3 Relations with North Korea**


with North Korea even during the COVID-19 pandemic.
China has reportedly adopted three principles on the
Korea Peninsula – (1) the denuclearization of the Korean
Peninsula, (2) the maintenance of peace and stability on
the Korean Peninsula, and (3) the resolution of problems
through dialogue and consultations – indicating that
China gives priority to the maintenance of stability and
dialogue as well as the denuclearization. Under these
principles, China, while agreeing to UN Security Council
resolutions to enhance sanctions on North Korea,
cooperated with Russia in distributing a draft resolution
including a proposal to lift some of the UN sanctions at
the council in December 2019.
Although China has vowed to have seriously
observed its international obligations, it has been
pointed out that Chinese ships have been involved
in illicit ship-to-ship transfer prohibited by the UN
Security Council resolutions.

**4 Relations with Other Countries**


**Chapter**


**(1) Relations with Southeast Asian Countries**
As for its relations with countries in Southeast Asia,
reciprocal summit-level visits and other activities
continue to be actively carried out. China is also actively
involved in multilateral frameworks such as ASEAN Plus
One (China), ASEAN Plus Three (Japan, China and the
ROK), East Asia Summit (EAS) and ASEAN Regional
Forum (ARF). Furthermore, China has developed
bilateral relations through infrastructure development
support, etc., under the BRI.
On the military front, there seems to be moves that
China has made efforts toward military confidence
building, such as the first ASEAN-China Maritime Field
Training Exercise, which took place in October 2018. In
July 2019, it was reported that a secret deal on China’s
exclusive use of part of Cambodia’s Ream Naval Base
had been signed between the two countries. Concerning
this matter, the Cambodian side denied the existence of
such a fact, saying that hosting foreign military bases is
against its Constitution.
In July 2016, an arbitration award based on the United
Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea (UNCLOS)
adjudicating the Philippines’ case against China in the
South China Sea was rendered, accepting most of the
Philippine claims. After that, the Philippines was said to
have refrained from referring to the arbitration award.
In September 2019, however, a Philippine Presidential
Office spokesperson noted that the arbitration award
was still a subject in bilateral talks, and in September
2020, President Rodrigo Duterte remarked at the United


China has kept close relations with North Korea under
the 1961 Sino-North Korean Mutual Aid and Cooperation
Friendship Treaty. Although Chinese and North Korean
leaders’ reciprocal visits have been viewed as decreasing
since North Korea’s transition to the Kim Jong-un regime,
Xi Jinping in June 2019 became the first Chinese president
to visit North Korea in 14 years and held his fifth meeting
with Chairman Kim. In October 2020, President Xi
Jinping sent congratulatory messages to Chairman Kim
Jong-un on the 75th anniversary of the Korean Workers’
Party. President Xi expressed the view that China were
prepared to make new, positive contributions to peace,
stability, development and prosperity of the region,
indicating China’s intention to maintain close relations


-----

Nations General Assembly that, “The (Arbitral) Award
is now part of international law beyond compromise
and beyond the reach of passing governments to dilute,
diminish, or abandon.” In April 2019, the Philippines
announced a protest statement against China over
massive Chinese fishing boats confirmed as near Thitu
Island under effective Philippine control among the
Spratly Islands.[29] Furthermore, the Government of the
Philippines announced that it had lodged a protest in
April 2020 against China in relation to an incident
in which a Chinese ship irradiated a Filipino ship in
February 2020.
In July 2017 and March 2018, the Vietnamese
government reportedly made foreign companies,
engaged in oil drilling in the South China Sea with the
permission of the Vietnamese government, cancel the
drilling under the pressure from China. Chinese and
Vietnamese government ships staged a standoff over
oil and natural gas drilling within Vietnam’s exclusive
economic zone from July 2019 until Vietnam withdrew
its HAKURYU-5 drilling rig in October of that year
to end the standoff. The Government of Vietnam also
announced in April 2020 that it had protested the
Chinese side concerning the incident in which a China
Coast Guard vessel rammed and sunk a Vietnamese
fishing boat near the Paracel Islands.
Indonesia has had frequent disputes with China over
Chinese fishing boats’ operations within Indonesia’s
exclusive economic zone and taken strong actions
against foreign fishing boats engaging in alleged illegal
operations. Recently, the Indonesian government filed
a strong protest against Chinese fishing boats’ illegal
operations near Indonesia’s Natuna Islands from
December 2019 to January 2020, rejecting China’s
assertion on the nine-dash line anew.
China and ASEAN have continued talks to discuss
the formulation of the Code of Conduct of Parties in the
South China Sea (COC) and Chinese Premier Li Keqiang
announced in November 2018 that he hoped to complete
negotiations within three years. In July 2019, China
announced at the Chinese and ASEAN Foreign Ministers’
meeting that they had completed the first reading of the
Single Draft COC Negotiating Text.

**(2) Relations with Central Asian Countries**
The Xinjiang Uyghur Autonomous Region, located in the
western part of China, is situated next to Central Asia.
Therefore, China is deeply concerned about the political
stability and security situations, such as terrorism by
Islamic extremists, in Central Asian states. Such concerns
of China appear to be reflected in China’s tightened


border control and its engagement in the SCO and the
stabilization of Afghanistan. Moreover, China is strongly
interested in Central Asia, with a view to diversifying its
supply sources and procurement methods for resources.
China promotes cooperation in the energy field with
Central Asian countries, such as the construction of oil
and natural gas pipelines between China and Central
Asian nations.

**(3) Relations with South Asian Countries**
China has traditionally maintained a particularly close
relationship with Pakistan, and mutual visits by their
summit leaders take place frequently. Their cooperation
in the military sector, including bilateral exercises,
exporting weapons and transferring military technology,
is also considered to be deepening. As the importance
of sea lanes increases for China, it is believed that the
importance of Pakistan is rising for China accordingly,
partly because of the geopolitical features of Pakistan
which faces the Indian Ocean. China has also conducted
various bilateral military exercises with Pakistan,
including naval search and rescue training and antiterrorism drills. The China-Pakistan Economic Corridor
(CPEC), a China-supported development plan for power
facilities and transportation infrastructure in the region
stretching from the Port of Gwadar to Kashgar in the
Xinjiang Uyghur Autonomous Region, is a flagship
project of the BRI. While some have pointed out that the
project has run into difficulties as indicated by delays
and partial withdrawals due to Pakistan’s deteriorating
financial situation, the project’s progress is expected to
further increase China’s influence in Pakistan.
China and India have not demarcated their borders
in areas such as Kashmir and Arunachal Pradesh. As
China and Bhutan, which has close relations with India,
have claimed territorial rights over the Doklam Plateau,
Chinese and Indian military forces staged a standoff
at the plateau from June to August 2017. On the other
hand, it has been pointed out that China has recently
striven to improve its relationship with India, while
giving consideration to a balance between its relations
with Pakistan and India. Because China identifies the
relationship with India as a strategic partnership, the
leaders of the two countries actively conduct mutual
visits. In December 2018, China and India resumed
their “Hand in Hand” bilateral anti-terrorism drill that
had been suspended since the Doklam standoff. The
background for progress in China’s relations with India
seems to include an emphasis on economic growth of
the two countries and a response to closer U.S.-India
relations. Amid such a situation, in May 2020, a clash


**Chapter**


-----

between Indian and Chinese forces occurred in the
China-India border area in Ladahk, India. The incident
that occurred on June 15, 2020, resulted in a deadly
clash for the first time in 45 years and raised tensions
between the two countries. In September 2020, foreign
ministers of China and India had a meeting in Moscow
and agreed to continue having dialogues for the ChinaIndia border dispute.
In recent years, China has also been deepening its
relations with Sri Lanka. Initially after taking office,
President Maithripala Sirisena, who won the election
in January 2015, suspended the Colombo Port City
development projects financed by China. However, he
subsequently announced the resumption of the projects
in January 2016, and new development projects with
China have also been showing progress. In July 2017,
an agreement was reached to lend interests to Chinese
enterprises at the Port of Hambantota, which was being
constructed with Chinese loans. Some have noted
that these moves constitute what has been described
as a “debt trap.” Additionally, China is deepening its
relations with Bangladesh through its port development
in Chittagong where a naval base is located, arms
exports, and other deals.

**(4) Relations with European Countries**
For China, the European Union (EU) countries have become
an important partner especially in the economic field.
European countries possess more advanced military
technologies than China or Russia regarding information
and communication technology, avionics/aeroengines, air
independence propulsion (AIP) systems for submarines,
and other areas. The EU countries have maintained their
arms embargo on China since the Tiananmen Square
incident in 1989 and China has requested them to lift the
embargo.[30] If the EU arms embargo on China were lifted,
sophisticated military technologies could be transferred
to China and to third countries via China, dramatically
changing the security environment in the Indo-Pacific
and other regions.
Additionally, China and Ukraine have close ties in the
field of arms procurement, as indicated by China’s purchase
of the unfinished Ukrainian Kuznetsov-class aircraft
carrier “Varyag,” which was the basis of the aircraft carrier
“Liaoning.” Therefore, the relationship between these two
countries will attract attention going forward.
China’s recent rise has attracted attention from the
NATO as well. The London declaration adopted at a
NATO summit conference in December 2019 referred
to China’s growing influence as both “opportunities and
challenges” and noted necessity to address China as an


Alliance. After the summit, NATO Secretary General
Jens Stoltenberg mentioned China’s deployment of
numerous intermediate-range missiles and noted that
NATO was considering how China could be included in
future arms control.
China’s relations with European countries, including
EU discussions on the arms embargo on China and
NATO’s China policy related to future arms control,
should be continuously watched.

**(5) Relations with Middle East and African Countries,**
**Pacific Island countries, and Central and South**
**American Countries**

China has been enhancing its relations with Middle
Eastern and African nations in the economic realm. In
recent years, it has also strengthened military relations
with them. Not only intensive interactions among state
leaders and senior military officials but also arms exports
and exchanges between military forces are actively
conducted. China also actively dispatches personnel
to undertake UN PKO in Africa. Some suspect that
underlying these movements could be China’s aim to
ensure a stable supply of natural resources and to secure
overseas bases in the future. In December 2016, São
Tomé and Príncipe severed diplomatic relations with
Taiwan and re-established relations with China, followed
by Burkina Faso in May 2018.
China is Australia’s biggest trade partner. However,
there has been economic friction between the two
countries such as China’s successive restriction on
importing Australian beef and other goods since Australia
suggested the necessity for independent investigation into
the origin of COVID-19. China has also been boosting
its relations with Pacific island countries by providing
them with proactive and continuous economic support
and medical services deploying a military hospital ship.
China has promoted resources development in Papua
New Guinea and signed an agreement with the island
country on military cooperation. China has also been
moving to enhance military relations with Vanuatu, Fiji,
and Tonga. While China has been enhancing relations
with Pacific island nations, Australia and some other
countries have expressed concerns about such Chinese
moves. In September 2019, the Solomon Islands and
Kiribati severed diplomatic relations with Taiwan and
established such relations with China.
China has been striving to further deepen its relations
with Central and South American countries, holding
ministerial meetings with the Community of Latin
American and Caribbean States (CELAC) since 2015. In
the military field, China has dispatched senior officials


**Chapter**


-----

and sold arms to these countries and enhanced relations
with them in medical services, counterterrorism and
other areas. In Argentina, China operates an outer space
observation facility. In June 2017, Panama severed
diplomatic relations with Taiwan and established such
relations with China, followed by the Dominican Republic
in May 2018 and by El Salvador in August 2018.

**5 International Transfer of Weapons**


been reportedly exporting arms to Algeria, Tanzania,
Nigeria, Sudan, and other African countries, Venezuela
and other Latin American countries, and Iran, Saudi
Arabia, and other Middle Eastern countries. Recently,
Serbia has been reported likely to become the first
European country to introduce Chinese UAVs. Some
claim that China has transferred weapons to foreign
countries in order to strengthen its strategic relationships
with friendly nations, enhance its influence in the
international community, and secure natural resources.
China has not participated in some of the frameworks
for international arms export control, and some point
out that missile-related and other technologies have
been transferred from China to other countries.


China has been expanding exports of weapons such
as small arms, tanks, aircraft including drones, and
ships. China’s major arms export destinations include
Pakistan, Bangladesh and Myanmar. China has also

of recognizing self-reliance and self-strengthening
of science and technology as the strategic support to
the country’s development and stressed the necessity
to uphold the system and mechanism of science and
technology innovation.
The United States also implemented a measure to
place visa restrictions on certain Chinese persons and add
Chinese firms to its Entity List, which restricts the export
from the United States, for reasons such as stealing
American trade secrets, involvement in human rights
abuses, and militarization activities in the South China
Sea. In response to the U.S. measures, China established
the same Entity List system as the United States and
passed the Export Control Law of the People’s Republic
of China for controlling the export of technologies
related to the national security and interest. As further
pushing back against the United States measures, in
January 2021, China passed new rules to protect its firms
from “unjustified extra-territorial application of foreign
legislation and other measures.”
Furthermore, in July 2020, the United States ordered

to mount a sustained challenge to a stable and open


During the former Trump administration, the United States
indicated that the re-emergence of long-term strategic
competition from revisionist powers including China was
a central challenge to its prosperity and security. With this
as a backdrop, the United States recognizes that China
is pursuing regional hegemony in the Indo-Pacific in the
near future through the modernization of its military and
other efforts.[3] It is viewed that the Biden administration
will basically continue with taking the deterrence stance
against China. In February 2021, President Biden, in
his address on diplomatic policies, called China “most
serious competitor” of the United States, and then in his
remarks to the Department of Defense in the same month
mentioned that the United States would need to respond to
the issues brought by China for defending its interest in the
Indo-Pacific and around the world. In the same remarks,
President Biden also talked about a new China task force
within the Department of Defense and announced that the
task force would provide recommendations to Defense
Secretary Austin on key priorities and decision points
within the next few months. Furthermore, in March 2021,
the United States released its Interim National Security

only competitor potentially capable of combining its


the closure of Chinese consulate in Houston, Texas,
due to its involvement in the act of stealing intellectual
property. China, in response to the U.S. order, also ordered
the United States to close its consulate in Chengdu, and
expressed that the current situation between the two
countries was not intended by the Chinese side, and that
the entire responsibility was on the U.S. side.
Since the inauguration of the Biden administration, in
light of the remarks by a high-level official of the U.S.
Department of Defense that the issue of technology
competition is clearly increasing its importance in
the U.S.-China relationship, the competition in the
technology field between the two countries is likely to
intensity further.
While China emphasizes its uncompromising stance
on the country’s core interests and significant concerns,
the United States indicates an uncompromising stance
on its national security. Going forward, it is deemed that
the strategic competition between the United States and
China will become more prominent in various fields.

economic, diplomatic, military, and technological power
to mount a sustained challenge to a stable and open
international system” At the congressional hearing held
in the same month, the Commander of the U.S. IndoPacific Command (USINDOPACOM) Phil Davidson
described the military balance in the Indo-Pacific as not
desirable to the United States and its allies, and pointed
out the growing risk of China seeking to change the status
quo in the region. He testified that China was accelerating
its ambitions for taking the U.S.’s leading role in a rulesbased global order, and that China’s ambitions for Taiwan
would become clear within the next six years. In response
to such a U.S. perception, China expressed that it expects
the United States to abandon the outdated zero-sum
thinking and take more rational and practical policies
towards China.
At the 19th National Congress of the Chinese
Communist Party in October 2017, China mentioned
its plan to transform Chinese forces into world-class
forces by the mid-21st century as the goal to modernize
national defense and military forces, and has been rapidly
developing its military power. Although China has not
clearly shown the definition of the “world-class forces,”
the United States, in the Department of Defense Annual
Report to Congress 2020, views that China may aim to
build a military that has parity with or in some cases

may exceed the U.S. Forces. Regarding such China’s
military power, this report also points out that the
People’s Liberation Army (PLA) has already exceeded
the United States in some areas including the number of
ships owned and the number of land-based conventional
ballistic missiles, and that the number of warheads on
China’s “land-based ICBMs capable of threatening the
United States is expected to grow to roughly 200 in the
next five years.”
In relation to the U.S.-Russia Intermediate-Range
Nuclear Forces (INF) Treaty, which came to an end in
August 2019, the United States demands the inclusion
of China into arms control negotiations, as China has
beefed up land-based conventional ballistic missile
capabilities outside the framework of the INF Treaty.
In addition, the United States expressed the same view
in the process of the extension negotiation of the New
START Treaty (Strategic Arms Reduction Treaty), of
which the extension was decided in February 2021,
clearly showing its intention to put a certain degree
of brake on China’s missile capability development.
However, China has been consistently refusing[4] to slow
down, claiming that the United States should lead the
implementation of disarmament.
The United States has reiterated that the Article 5 of
the Japan-U.S. Security Treaty applies to the Senkaku
Islands. This was confirmed in February 2017, in the joint
statement from the first Japan-U.S. summit meeting since
the inauguration of the former Trump administration,
which explicitly referred to the application of Article 5 of
the Treaty to the Senkaku Islands. The U.S. policy on this
matter remains the same and has been confirmed since
the inauguration of the Biden administration through
summit telephone talks, defense ministerial meetings,
foreign ministerial meetings, and the Joint Statement
of the Japan-U.S. “2+2” Meeting in March 2021. China
has shown its strong protest against these stances. With
regard to the issues over the South China Sea, the United
States is concerned about such dimensions as obstruction
to the freedom of navigation in sea lanes, restrictions on
the activities of U.S. Forces, and the worsening security
situation in the entire region. The United States has
requested China comply with international norms, and
has repeatedly criticized China’s unilateral and assertive
actions. And the United States also implements the
Freedom of Navigation Operation in the South China Sea
and other waters to counter excessive claims to maritime
interests by other countries such as China and calls for
demilitarizing the South China Sea.
In this way, while China is rapidly strengthening

5 ASIA MARITIME TRANSPARENCY INITIATIVE MARCH 5, 2020


military power against the backdrop of its economic
development and other factors, changes in the military
power balance between the United States and China can
affect peace and stability of the Indo-Pacific. Thus, the
U.S.-China military trends in the region concerning the
South China Sea and Taiwan will require further attention.

**2 South China Sea**


Since 2014, China implemented rapid and large-scale land
reclamation projects in the Spratly Islands. Following
the completion of the land reclamation in 2015, even
after the illegality of the Chinese activities such as land
reclamation was determined at the Philippines-China
arbitration in July 2016, China has made it clear that
it would not comply with the decision and has been
promoting its plan to militarize the area.
China has also been actively conducting military
activities in the South China Sea including conducting
military exercises in the Spratly Islands in July 2020,
reportedly launching a Medium Range Ballistic Missile
(MRBM) in August of the same year, and also carrying
out military exercises with aircraft carriers in December
of the same year.
Moreover, China utilizes not only its military forces
but also the Coast Guard, which is a “maritime law
enforcement organization” in the Coast Guard law,
and so-called maritime militia to increase pressure
on the neighboring countries. In the area surrounding
Thitu Island, which is under the effective control of
the Philippines, as of March 2020, China had been
continuously carrying out activities for more than
450 days. It is noted that, as a result of those Chinese
activities, the progress of the Philippines’ renovation plan
of the island was delayed.[5] Meanwhile, in Scarborough
Shoal, of which China took effective control, Chinese
Coast Guard vessels had been operating nearly 300 days
in a year since December 2019, which is pointed out as
a significant increase compared to the previous year.[6]
Despite the spread of the COVID-19 infectious disease,
China seems to be increasing its presence in the South
China Sea. Furthermore, in April 2020, a Chinese Coast
Guard ship rammed and sunk a Vietnamese fishing boat
near the Paracel Islands, while in May 2020, a Coast Guard
ship interfered with Filipino fishermen's operations. In
this way, there have been cases that interfered with fishery
activities of the neighboring countries in the South China
Sea. In February 2021, the China Coast Guard Law, which
stipulates the responsibility and authority of the China
Coast Guard including the use of weapons, entered into


**Chapter**


-----

force. This Law includes problematic provisions in terms
of their inconsistency with international law. Sources of
inconsistency include, among others, ambiguity as to
geographical areas the Coast Guard Law applies and how
the rules governing the use of weapons are implemented,
and neighboring countries started expressing concerns
about Chinese moves. The Philippines announced that
its Minister of Foreign Affairs had protested against the
CCG Law through a diplomatic route. Furthermore, in
Vietnam a foreign ministry spokesperson commented that,
“Vietnam requests relevant countries that they respect
Vietnam’s sovereignty, sovereign rights, and jurisdiction
in the South China Sea, responsibly and faithfully enforce
international laws and the United Nations Convention on
the Law of the Sea, and avoid behavior that raises tension
between countries.”
With regard to the issues over the South China Sea, the
United States has been criticizing China’s behavior and
implementing the Freedom of Navigation Operations.
Since the former Trump administration, the United States
has been demonstrating more severe stance against such
moves by China.
In July 2020, the United States released a U.S.
Secretary of State’s statement entitled “U.S. Position on
Maritime Claims in the South China Sea,” and accused
China of illegal maritime claims across most areas of
the South China Sea. In August of the same year, the
U.S. Department of State announced visa restrictions
on Chinese individuals as a sanction against China’s
militarization activities in the South China Sea. In this
announcement, a high-level official of the Department of
State mentioned that this sanction was only the beginning
of imposing many other means against China’s malign
activities in the South China Sea. On the same day, the
United States Department of Commerce announced that
it had added 24 Chinese firms to the Entity List for the
reasons that they had supported the PLA constructing
artificial islands and conducting militarizing activities
in the South China Sea. Since the inauguration of the
Biden administration, the United States has continued to
show its consistent deterrence stance against China. For
example, U.S. Secretary of State Blinken stated that the
United States would reject China’s claims about maritime
interests in the South China Sea, and stand up together
with Southeast Asian countries facing China’s pressure.
The United States has sought to enhance military
efforts in the South China Sea. It has frequently conducted
the Freedom of Navigation Operations, carried out joint
exercises in July 2020 by deploying two Carrier Strike
Groups for the first time since 2014, and even after
President Biden took office, in February 2021, once
again conducted similar exercises. The United States has
also conducted exercises with Japan Australia and other


partner countries. Responding to these American efforts,
China has criticized the United States for hindering the
peace and stability of the region.
Going forward, while forming free and open order
based on the rule of law is important in the South
China Sea, the military tensions may rise. Japan, which
promotes the vision of a “Free and Open Indo-Pacific”
with the United States, will have to pay great attention to
the situation.

**3 Taiwan**


China upholds the principle that Taiwan is a part of
China and that the Taiwan issue is a domestic one.
China maintains that the “One China” principle is the
underlying premise and foundation for dialogue between
China and Taiwan. China is strongly opposed to any
foreign intervention in the unification of China as well
as any move towards the independence of Taiwan and
has repeatedly stated that it has not renounced the use of
force. “The Anti-Secession Law,” enacted in March 2005,
clearly lays out China’s policy of not renouncing the use
of force, providing that in the event that possibilities for
a peaceful reunification should be completely exhausted,
the state shall employ nonpeaceful means and other
necessary measures to protect China’s sovereignty and
territorial integrity.
On the other hand, conventionally, the United States has
been promoting its policy on Taiwan based on the Taiwan
Relations Act, the U.S.-China Joint Communique, and six
assurances, and does not intend to change its approach
to the “One China” principle. However, since the former
Trump administration, the U.S. government has been
expressing the stance to deepening its involvement in
the situation surrounding Taiwan. In the Indo-Pacific
Strategy Report (IPSR) of the U.S. Department of
Defense released in June 2019, the intention of the
United States to pursue a strong partnership with Taiwan
is mentioned. The United States, in the U.S. Strategic
Framework for the Indo-Pacific, which was released by
the White House in January 2021, states that it enables
“Taiwan to develop an effective asymmetric defense
strategy,” while also aiming for the United States to be
capable of “defending the first-island-chain nations,
including Taiwan.”
The United States has made decisions to sell arms to
Taiwan under the Taiwan Relations Act. Since President
Trump took office in 2017, 11 such decisions have been
made. In 2019, the president notified Congress of its plan
to sell such weapons as 66 F-16C/D Block 70 fighters to
Taiwan, the first U.S. fighter sales to Taiwan in the 27
years since 1992. From October to November 2020, the
United States also notified Congress in swift succession


**Chapter**

China has further intensified military activities around
Taiwan. In particular, according to Taiwan’s Ministry
of Defense, Chinese aircraft’s entering the Taiwanese
side of the China-Taiwan “median line” of the Taiwan
Strait and the southwestern airspace of Taiwan have
been increasing since September 2020, and a total of
approximately 380 Chinese military aircraft entered the
southwestern airspace of Taiwan during 2020. In the
same year, ships of the Chinese military forces including
aircraft carriers passed through the Bashi Channel and
conducted exercises. Due to these increasing military
activities by China in the vicinity of Taiwan and the
response from the Taiwanese side to the situation, the
possibility of military tension between China and Taiwan
to become further heightened cannot be denied.
These trends between the United States and China are
expected to continue during the Biden administration.
The United States invited a representative of the Taipei
Economic and Cultural Representative Office in the
United States to the inauguration ceremony of President
Biden for the first time since 1979 when the country
broke off diplomatic relations with Taiwan. In addition,
the United States has repeatedly made remarks requesting
China that it should stop imposing pressure on Taiwan in
military and other areas, including at summit meetings
and foreign ministers’ meetings. Furthermore, the United
States is sending U.S. vessels to pass through the Taiwan
Strait, while China has strongly protested against the
U.S. moves. China deployed more than 10 Chinese
military aircraft to enter the southwestern airspace of
Taiwan for the second straight day in January 2021, and
in the same month, some Chinese media reported that
Chinese military aircraft flying in the vicinity of Taiwan
had already “become normal,” and these aircraft would
appear over Taiwan in the not-so-distant future. While the
Biden administration is clarifying its stance of supporting
Taiwan in the military-related area, in the same way as the
former Trump administration, it is deemed unlikely that
China, which position Taiwan as its core interests, will
show a compromising attitude towards the U.S. stance.
It is viewed that the U.S.-China conflict over Taiwan
may become more apparent. Stabilizing the situation
surrounding Taiwan is important not only for Japan’s
security but also for the stability of the international
community. Therefore, it is necessary that we pay close
attention to the situation with a sense of crisis more than
ever before.

of the plan to sell the High Mobility Artillery Rocket
System (HIMARS), long range air-to-surface missiles,
and surface-to-ship missiles. In addition, the United
States has frequently sent its vessels to pass through the
Taiwan Strait.
The United States has also demonstrated its stance
on more active implementation of visits of U.S. highlevel government officials to Taiwan. U.S. Secretary of
Health and Human Services Alex Azar and U.S. Under
Secretary of State Keith Krach visited Taiwan in August
and September 2020 respectively, and in January 2021,
U.S. Secretary of State Pompeo announced the removal
of restrictions on contacts between U.S. officials and
their Taiwanese counterparts, which had been in place
voluntarily in consideration of the Chinese government.
With regard to the United States, not only the
government but also Congress has indicated its
intention to further enhance support for Taiwan. The
Asia Reassurance Initiative Act, passed in December
2018, stipulates regular transfers of defense articles to
Taiwan and encouragement of the travel of high-level
U.S. officials to Taiwan. Similarly, the Taiwan Allies
International Protection and Enhancement Initiative
(TAIPEI) Act, enacted in March 2020, stipulates the
promotion of regular transfers of defense articles to
Taiwan. The TAIPEI Act also includes the encouragement
for the U.S. government to provide support for “altering
its economic, security, and diplomatic engagement
with nations that take serious or significant actions to
undermine the security or prosperity of Taiwan” and for
advocating Taiwan’s participation and membership in
international organizations.

**3** **Military Capabilities of Taiwan and Military Balance between China and Taiwan**


**1 Relations with China**

Taiwanese President Tsai Ing-wen from the Democratic
Progressive Party, who took office in 2016, has noted
that she has never accepted the “1992 Consensus” that
China claims as embodying the “One-China” principle.[7]
In response, China has criticized the Democratic
Progressive Party for destroying the political foundation
of the peaceful development of cross-Strait relations by
rejecting the “1992 Consensus” unilaterally, emphasizing
that the maintenance of the “1992 Consensus” would
be the unshakable foundation for peace and stability of
cross-Strait relations.
In a January 2019 speech at an event commemorating
the 40th anniversary of China’s “Message to Compatriots
in Taiwan,” General Secretary Xi Jinping advocated a
five-point proposal for managing relations with Taiwan,
stating “the specific form of the ‘one country, two
systems’ model in Taiwan will give full consideration to
the situation in Taiwan.” In her immediate response to the
speech, President Tsai issued a statement firmly rejecting
the “one country, two systems” model and called for
negotiations between “government-authorized agencies.”
After winning re-election with the highest ever number
of votes in a Taiwanese presidential election in January
2020, President Tsai told a press conference the election
results represented the value of Taiwanese people and
rejected the “one country, two systems” model. In a
manner to check the Taiwanese side, China noted that
regardless of how the Taiwanese situation changed, there
would be no change to the basic fact that there is only one
China in the world, with Taiwan being a part of China.
Since around the inauguration of President Tsai for her
first term, Taiwanese delegates were refused attendance
at or had their invitations deferred from meetings held by
international organizations, including ones in which they
had participated up to that point.[8] As the Solomon Islands
and Kiribati severed diplomatic relations with Taiwan
and established such relations with China in September
2019, the number of countries having diplomatic relations
with Taiwan declined to 15 from 22 in May 2016, when
President Tsai took office. Taiwan is strongly protesting
these actions, claiming them to be “actions taken by
China that compress the international space of Taiwan.”


**2 Taiwan’s Military Power**

Since China has consistently expressed its intention of
not renouncing the use of force to Taiwan, the country
may make a decision on military options such as air and
maritime blockade, limited use of force, air and missile
operations, and invasion of Taiwan. If that happens, it
is deemed that China will deter or delay any potential
U.S. interventions. In response to such moves of China,
Taiwan under President Tsai Ing-wen has put forth
defense visions to prevent the invasion from China at
the farthest points possible within its territory with a
multi-layered defense posture, which combines major
equipment such as fighters and vessels with asymmetric
force. It is assumed that these defense visions aim to
delay the invasion of the PLA to buy some time until
the intervention of the U.S. Forces. The Taiwan National
Defense Report 2019, released in September 2019 as the
second such report under President Tsai, followed these
visions and clarified Taiwan as an important security
partner to the United States in the Indo-Pacific region.
In March 2021, Taiwan also released the Quadrennial
Defense Review (QDR), which is the fourth review since
2009. This report aims to present the national defense
strategy and military power development policy for the
next four years to contribute to strengthening the national
defense. In the report, Taiwan assesses China’s military
threat and states that China is improving operational
capabilities through landing exercises assuming an
invasion of Taiwan and the implementation of gray-zone
strategies, while maintaining capabilities for the blockade
of waters around the Taiwan Strait and Anti-Access/Area

**Chapter**

The “1992 Consensus” refers to what represents a common understanding reached between Chinese and Taiwanese authorities in 1992 on the “One-China” principle. The CCP and Taiwan’s
Kuomintang Nationalist Party (Taiwan’s ruling party at the time), viewed as parties to the consensus, have reportedly differed over the interpretation of the consensus. In addition, Taiwan’s Democratic
Progressive Party has clarified that it has not accepted the “1992 Consensus.”

Denial (A2/AD). Based on the evaluation, Taiwan intends
to enhance its defense capabilities by enhancing longrange weapons and asymmetric forces and developing
surveillance capabilities, while Taiwan utilizes new
technologies such as big data analysis, and cooperates with
the Navy and the Coast Guard Administration in order to
deal with China’s gray-zone situations.
Taiwan adopted conscription in 1951, but it has been
switching to a volunteer system mainly to improve the
expertise of its military personnel, and the last of the
conscripts were enlisted by the end of 2018. However,
the obligation to undergo four months of military training
is being maintained and Taiwan’s Ministry of Defense
describes the Taiwanese system of military service as a
dual-track mix of conscripts and volunteers.
With regard to Taiwan’s military power, at present,
ground forces, including the Navy Marine Corps, have
a total of approximately 100,000 personnel. In addition,
it is assessed that approximately 1.66 million reserve
personnel of the air, naval, and ground forces would be
available in case of war. Regarding naval capabilities, in
addition to Kidd-class destroyers which were imported
from the United States, Taiwan possesses the indigenously
built “Tuo Chiang” stealth corvette, among other vessels.
Regarding air capabilities, Taiwan possesses F-16 (A/B
and C/D) fighters, Mirage 2000 fighters, Ching-kuo
fighters, and other assets.


**3 Military Balance between China and Taiwan**

While China has continued to increase its defense budget
by a significant margin, Taiwan’s defense budget, at
approximately 361.8 billion Taiwan dollars for FY2021,
has remained almost unchanged for nearly 20 years.
China’s announced military budget in FY2021 totals
approximately 1,355.3 billion yuan, roughly 16 times
the amount of Taiwan’s in terms of U.S. dollars based on
exchange rates announced by the Taiwanese Central Bank.
It is pointed out that China’s actual defense expenditure
has been larger than the published defense budget,
indicating that the China-Taiwan defense expenditure
gap could be greater. Amid this situation, President Tsai
has ordered an increase in Taiwan’s defense budget.
In the National Defense Report 2019, Taiwan
acknowledges that China is currently only capable
of conducting joint landing operations to take over
“Taiwan’s offshore islands,” while also assessing that
China already possesses early warning capability on the
western side of the so-called second island chain, and the
ability to implement air and maritime blockade operations
in the vicinity of the Taiwan Strait. It also recognizes
that China is drastically tilting the cross-Taiwan Strait
military balance to its favor, “posing a serious threat to
our (Taiwan’s) national defense and security.”
While the PLA proceeds to expand its missile, naval,

and air forces, the Taiwan military is struggling in the
modernization of its equipment.
The military capabilities of China and Taiwan are
generally characterized as follows:
(1) Regarding ground forces, while China possesses
an overwhelming number of troops, its capability
of landing and invading the island of Taiwan is
limited at present. In recent years, however, China
has been steadily improving its landing and invasion
capabilities by building large amphibious ships.
(2) Regarding naval and air forces, China, which
overwhelms Taiwan in terms of quantity, has also
been rapidly strengthening its naval and air forces in
recent years in terms of quality, where Taiwan used to
have superiority over China. In this situation, Taiwan
focuses on developing asymmetric forces including
stealth corvettes.
(3) Regarding missile attack capabilities, Taiwan has

been strengthening its ballistic missile defense,
upgrading the PAC-2 to the PAC-3 and introducing
the PAC-3. However, China possesses numerous
short-range ballistic missiles and other assets with
ranges covering Taiwan. Taiwan is deemed to lack
effective countermeasures.
Comparison of military capabilities should be made
based not only on the troop strength and the performance
and quantity of equipment but also on various other
factors such as the purpose and aspects of assumed
military operations, operational arrangements, the skill


level of personnel, and logistics. Nevertheless, the
overall military balance between China and Taiwan
is tilting to China’s favor, and the gap appears to be
growing year by year. Going forward, attention needs to
be paid to trends such as the strengthening of Chinese and
Taiwanese forces, the sale of weapons to Taiwan by the
United States, and Taiwan’s own development of its main
military equipment.

“must further strengthen the nuclear war deterrent while
doing our best to build up the most powerful military
strength” to clarify the North Korea’s intention to
continue engaging in the development of nuclear and
missile capabilities. These remarks indicate that North
Korea will continue to make efforts to maintain and
enhance its military capabilities and combat readiness.
According to the official announcement at the Supreme
People’s Assembly in January 2021, the proportion of
the defense budget in the FY2021 budget of North Korea
was 15.9%. However, it is believed that this represents
only a fraction of the real defense expenditures.
North Korea has continued to promote the development
of weapons of mass destruction (WMDs) and ballistic
missiles and the enhancement of its operation capabilities,
including by conducting six nuclear tests so far and
repeatedly launching ballistic missiles in recent years
at an unprecedented frequency. Technologically, North
Korea is considered to have already miniaturized nuclear
weapons to fit ballistic missile warheads and possess the
capability to launch an attack on Japan with a ballistic
missile fitted with a nuclear warhead. In addition, North
Korea is assessed to possess large-scale cyber units as
part of its asymmetric military capabilities, engaging in
theft of military secrets and developing capabilities to
attack critical infrastructure of foreign countries. It also
retains largescale special operation forces. In addition,
North Korea has repeatedly used provocative rhetoric
and behavior against relevant countries, including Japan.
Such military trends in North Korea pose grave and
imminent threats to Japan’s security and significantly
undermine the peace and security of the region and the
international community.
Needless to say, North Korea’s possession of nuclear
weapons cannot be tolerated. At the same time, sufficient
attention needs to be paid to the development and
deployment of ballistic missiles, the military confrontation
on the Korean Peninsula, and the proliferation of WMDs
and ballistic missiles by North Korea.
Partly because North Korea maintains its extremely
closed regime, it is difficult to accurately capture the details
and intentions of its behavior. However, it is necessary
for Japan to pay utmost attention to them. As for North
Korea’s abduction of Japanese nationals, utmost efforts
continue to be made to realize the return of all abductees


**1 General Situation**

At the Plenary Meeting of the Central Committee of the
Korean Workers’ Party (KWP) in March 2013, Chairman
Kim Jong-un[1] adopted the “Byungjin line” policy of
simultaneous economic and nuclear development. At the
7th Congress of the KWP in May 2016, he made it clear
that he would uphold the “Byungjin line” as well as the
“Songun politics.”[2] Between 2016 and 2017, North Korea
pushed ahead with three nuclear tests and as many as 40
ballistic missile launches. The international community
responded by imposing sanctions under relevant UN
Security Council resolutions, while Japan and the United
States were among those who strengthened their own
sanctions against North Korea.
On the other hand, at the Plenary Meeting of the Central
Committee of the KWP in April 2018, Chairman Kim
declared that the “Byungjin line” had been successfully
carried out as the development of the state nuclear force
had been completed. He also announced that the KWP’s
“new strategic line” was that the whole of the party and
the whole of the state will fully concentrate efforts on the
construction of a socialist economy. In addition, North
Korea decided to discontinue “nuclear test and intercontinental ballistic rocket test-fire,” announcing in May
2018 that the nuclear test ground had been blown up.
During the U.S.-North Korea summit meeting that June,
Chairman Kim expressed the intention to work towards
denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula.
However, the February 2019 U.S.-North Korea summit
meeting ended without any agreement being reached
between the two parties. At the December 2019 Plenary
Meeting of the Central Committee of the KWP, Chairman
Kim stated that, since the United States was holding
U.S.-ROK joint military exercises, there were no grounds
for North Korea to be unilaterally bound any longer
by a commitment that no other party honors. He also
announced the intention to continue developing strategic
weapons until the United States rolls back its hostile
policy towards North Korea. At the 8th Congress of the
KWP in January 2021, Chairman Kim showed a hostile
attitude towards the United States and stated that North
Korea’s external activities should focus on “prevailing
over and subjugating the US,” which is “our principal
enemy” Chairman Kim also mentioned that North Korea


**Chapter**


As of 2013, Kim Jong-un held the position of the First Chairman of the National Defense Commission. At the Supreme People’s Assembly in June 2016, the National Defense Commission was
renamed the State Affairs Commission, and Kim Jong-un assumed the position of Chairman of the State Affairs Commission. Reflecting this change, “Chairman of the State Affairs Commission” is
used for the title of Kim Jong-un throughout this white paper.

In a written decision of the 7th Congress of the KWP, “Report on the Work of the KWP Central Committee” (May 8, 2016), it has been defined as a basic form of socialist politics that leads the great
undertaking of socialism to victory by giving priority to the military forces in all activities under the principle of military first, and strengthening and relying on the actors in the revolution with the Korean

believed to be used for infiltration and transportation of
the special operations forces.
The Air Force has approximately 550 combat aircraft,
most of which are out-of-date models made in China
or the former Soviet Union. However, some fourthgeneration aircraft such as MiG-29 fighters and Su-25
attack aircraft are also included. North Korea has a large
number of outdated An-2 transport aircraft as well, which
are believed to be used for transportation of special
operations forces.
In addition, North Korea has so-called asymmetric
military capabilities, namely, special operations force
whose size is estimated at 100,000 personnel.[4] In recent
years, North Korea is seen to be placing importance on
and strengthening its cyber forces.[5]

See Chapter 3, Section 3-2-3 (North Korea), p. 182

**3 WMD and Ballistic Missiles**


**(1) General Situation**
North Korea has been building up its military capabilities
in accordance with the Four Military Guidelines
(extensive training for all soldiers, modernizing all
military forces, arming the entire population, and
fortifying the entire country).[3]

North Korea’s military forces are comprised mainly of
ground forces, with a total troop strength of roughly 1.28
million. While North Korea still maintains substantial
military forces, its conventional forces are markedly
inferior to those of the ROK’s military and U.S.
Forces Korea, and most of its equipment is outdated.
Contributory factors to this situation include the reduction
in military assistance from the former Soviet bloc due
to the collapse of the Cold War structure, limitations on
defense spending caused by the weak economy, and the
rapid modernization of ROK’s defense capability.
North Korea is thought to be attempting to compensate
for its consequent disadvantage by focusing its efforts on
building up its arsenal of WMDs and ballistic missiles.
North Korea also has forces such as a large-scale special
operations force that can conduct various operations
ranging from intelligence gathering and sabotage, to
guerrilla warfare. Moreover, North Korea seems to have
many underground military related installations across
its territory.

**(2) Military Capabilities**
The North Korean Army comprises about 1.10 million
personnel, and roughly two-thirds of them are believed to
be deployed along the DMZ. The main body of the army
is infantry, but the army also maintains armored forces
including at least 3,500 tanks and artillery. North Korea
is believed to regularly deploy long-range artillery along
the DMZ, such as 240 mm multiple rocket launchers
and 170 mm self-propelled guns, which can reach cities
and bases in the northern part of the ROK including the
capital city of Seoul.
The Navy has about 800 ships with a total displacement
of approximately 110,000 tons and is chiefly comprised
of small naval vessels such as high-speed missile craft.
Also, it has about 20 of the former model Romeo-class
submarines, about 40 midget submarines, and about 140
air cushioned landing crafts, the latter two of which are


**Chapter**


In recent years, North Korea has launched ballistic
missiles at an unprecedented frequency, rapidly improving
its operational capabilities, such as simultaneous launch
and surprise attack. In addition, given the technological
maturity obtained through a series of nuclear tests, North
Korea is assessed to have already miniaturized nuclear
weapons to fit ballistic missile warheads and possesses
the capability to launch an attack on Japan with a ballistic
missile fitted with the nuclear warhead.
These military trends in North Korea pose grave and
imminent threats to Japan’s security and significantly
undermine the peace and security of the region and the
international community. Additionally, such development
poses a serious challenge to the entire international
community with regard to the non-proliferation of
weapons, including WMDs.
On the other hand, at the Plenary Meeting of the Central
Committee of the KWP held on April 20, 2018, decisions
were made to discontinue “nuclear tests and intercontinental ballistic rocket test-fire.” In the subsequent
inter-Korean summit meeting held on April 27 and in
the U.S.-North Korea summit meeting held on June 12,
North Korea expressed its intention to work towards
denuclearization. Then, on May 24, international press
representatives were invited to witness the destruction of
the northern nuclear test ground.
However, North Korea has not yet carried out the
dismantlement of all WMDs and ballistic missiles of all
ranges in a complete, verifiable, and irreversible manner.
Having repeatedly carried out ballistic missile launches


The Four Military Guidelines were adopted at the 5th plenary meeting of the 4th KWP Central Committee in 1962.

James Thurman, then Commander of the U.S. Forces Korea, stated, “North Korea possesses the world’s largest special operations force of over 60,000” in his speech at the Association of U.S. Army
in October 2012. Additionally, the 2020 Defense White Paper of the ROK notes about North Korea’s Special operations force, “The forces are estimated at approximately 200,000 strong.”


-----

in breach of relevant Security Council resolutions since
May 2019, it seems that North Korea has been striving
to develop more advanced technologies and operational
capabilities in this field. Japan cannot possibly turn a
blind eye to this series of missile launches, which is an
issue of serious concern to the international community
as well.
At the December 2019 Plenary Meeting of the Central
Committee of the KWP, Chairman Kim stated that, since
the United States was holding U.S.-ROK joint military
exercises, there were no grounds for North Korea to be
unilaterally bound any longer by a commitment that no
other party fails to honor. He also announced the intention
to continue developing strategic weapons until the United
States rolls back its hostile policy towards North Korea.
Furthermore, North Korea held a military parade in
October 2020 and January 2021, in which a possible new
type of intercontinental ballistic missile-class (ICBMclass) ballistic missiles and a possible new type of
submarine-launched ballistic missiles (SLBM) appeared.
At the 8th Congress of the KWP in January 2021,
Chairman Kim asserted that “the hostile nature of
the American policy towards the DPRK” had been
strengthened, and showed the stance to continue to
improve the military power of North Korea in order
to deter the United States’ “military threat.” Chairman
Kim also mentioned his intention to the development of
“hypersonic gliding flight warheads” and so on, in addition
to the advancement of nuclear technology, such as “tactical
nuclear weapons development,” and preemptive and
retaliatory nuclear strike capabilities, indicating further
improvement of nuclear and missile capabilities.
Looking to the future, it will be necessary to continue
to carefully monitor moves by North Korea, including
what kind of concrete actions it will take towards the
dismantlement of all weapons of mass destruction and
ballistic missiles of all ranges in a complete, verifiable
and irreversible manner.

**(1) Nuclear Weapons**
a. The Current Status of the Nuclear Weapons Program
Details of the current status of North Korea’s nuclear
weapons program are largely unclear, partly because
North Korea remains an extremely closed regime. In


light of the unclear status of past nuclear developments,
and considering North Korea has already conducted six
nuclear tests including the nuclear test in September 2017,
it is conceivable that North Korea has made considerable
progress in its nuclear weapons program.
With regard to plutonium, a fissile material that can be
used for nuclear weapons,[6] North Korea has suggested
its production and extraction on several instances.[7] As
for recent activities, in September 2015, North Korea
announced that all nuclear facilities in Yongbyon,
including the nuclear reactor and the reprocessing facility,
the disablement of which was agreed upon at the fifth and
the sixth round of the Six-Party Talks in February and
September 2007, respectively, had been readjusted and
had started normal operation.[8] Because the restarting of
the reactor could lead to the production and extraction of
plutonium by North Korea, those activities are causes of
great concern.
As for highly enriched uranium that can also be
used for nuclear weapons, in June 2009, North Korea
declared the commencement of uranium enrichment.
In November 2010, North Korea disclosed its uranium
enrichment facility to American nuclear specialists
and later announced that it was operating a uranium
enrichment plant equipped with thousands of centrifuges.
The expansion of this uranium enrichment plant has been
suggested in August 2013; in this regard, North Korea
could have increased its enrichment capabilities. The
series of North Korean behaviors related to uranium
enrichment indicate the possibility of the development
of nuclear weapons using highly enriched uranium in
addition to plutonium.[9]

Regarding these nuclear-related activities, some
have pointed out about North Korea’s activities that
are inconsistent with a “commitment to work towards
complete denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula,”
which North Korea insists that it upholds. For example,
U.S. Secretary of State Pompeo testified in the Senate in
July 2018 that North Korea was continuing to produce
nuclear fuels, while at a meeting of the International
Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) Board of Governors,
IAEA Director General Rafael Grossi mentioned in
March 2021 that some nuclear facilities in North Korea
continued to operate.


**Chapter**


Plutonium is synthetically produced in a nuclear reactor by irradiating uranium with neutrons, and then extracting it from used nuclear fuel at a reprocessing facility. Plutonium is then used as a basic
material for the production of nuclear weapons. Meanwhile, in order to use uranium for nuclear weapons, it is necessary to extract uranium 235 (U235), a highly fissile material, from natural uranium.
This process is called enrichment. Generally, a large-scale enrichment facility that combines thousands of centrifuges is used to boost the U235 concentration to nuclear weapon levels (over 90%).

North Korea announced in October 2003 that it had completed the reprocessing of 8,000 used fuel rods that contain plutonium, and in May 2005 that it had completed extraction of an additional
8,000 used fuel rods. The 2020 Defense White Paper of the ROK estimates that North Korea possesses around 50 kg of plutonium, retaining the assessment given in the 2018 Defense White Paper.

The “Worldwide Threat Assessment” of the U.S. Director of National Intelligence of January 2016 notes, “North Korea has followed through on its announcement by expanding the size of its enrichment
facility and restarting the reactor that was previously used for plutonium production.” It is said that the reactor was restarted at the end of August 2013. It has been noted that if the reactor is restarted,
North Korea would have the capability to produce enough plutonium (approximately 6 kg) to manufacture approximately one nuclear bomb in one year.

The 2020 Defense White Paper of the ROK assesses that North Korea possesses a substantial amount of highly enriched uranium (HEU). It has been noted that a uranium enrichment facility different


-----

With regard to the development of nuclear weapons,
North Korea has conducted nuclear tests on October 9,
2006, May 25, 2009, February 12, 2013, January 6, 2016,
September 9, 2016, and September 3, 2017. It is highly
likely that North Korea has made strides in its nuclear
weapons program, collecting the necessary data through
these nuclear tests.
It is believed that North Korea seeks to miniaturize
nuclear weapons and develop them into warheads
that can be mounted on ballistic missiles, as part of its
nuclear weapons program. On September 3, 2017, it
was announced that Chairman Kim Jong-un had visited
North Korea’s Nuclear Weapons Institute and had seen a
hydrogen bomb capable of being loaded into an ICBM,[10]
in addition to which, following North Korea’s sixth
nuclear test that was forced through on the same day,
North Korea announced that it “successfully carried out a
test of H-bomb for ICBM.”
In general, miniaturizing a nuclear weapon small
enough to be mounted on a ballistic missile requires a
considerably high degree of technological capacity.
However, considering, for example, that the United States,
the former Soviet Union, the United Kingdom, France,
and China succeeded in acquiring such technology by as
early as the 1960s, as well as the technological maturity
that is estimated to have been reached through North
Korea’s previous six nuclear tests, it is assessed that
North Korea has already miniaturized nuclear weapons
to fit ballistic missile warheads.[11]

Furthermore, the yield of the sixth nuclear weapons
test in 2017 was estimated to be the largest ever, with
a maximum yield of approximately 160 kt. Given the
size of the estimated yield, the possibility cannot be
discounted that the test was of a hydrogen bomb.[12]

In any case, North Korea’s nuclear weapons
development, considered in conjunction with North
Korean efforts to enhance ballistic missile capabilities,
including extending the range of ballistic missiles that are
the delivery vehicles of WMDs, poses grave and imminent
threats to Japan’s security, and significantly undermines
peace and security of the region and international
community. Therefore, it can never be tolerated.

b. Background of the Nuclear Program
North Korea’s ultimate goal regarding nuclear
development is allegedly the maintenance of the existing
regime.[13] In addition, North Korea considers that it needs
its own nuclear deterrence to counter the nuclear threat of
the United States and is in no position at least in the shortterm to overturn its inferiority in conventional forces
vis-à-vis the United States and the ROK. Based on the
claims by North Korea that nuclear weapons would never
be traded away at negotiations, it is deemed that North
Korea is promoting nuclear development as indispensable
deterrent in maintaining the existing regime.
With regard to the issue of North Korea’s development
of nuclear weapons, Chairman Kim expressed the desire
on a number of occasions — including at the U.S.-North
Korea summit meeting held on June 2018 — to work
towards the complete denuclearization of the Korean
Peninsula. However, he is presumed to have done so on
the premise that North Korea would continue to possess
a nuclear arsenal. In fact, North Korea has frequently
asserted to the international community its claim to the
status of “a nuclear weapon state.” At the December 2019
Plenary Meeting of the Central Committee of the KWP,
Chairman Kim stated that if the United States persists
in its hostile policy, there will never be denuclearization
on the Korean Peninsula. In this way, North Korea has
repeatedly insisted that it will not agree to unilateral
denuclearization. In addition, it has been noted that even


**Chapter**


10 On September 3, 2017, in a report on a visit by Chairman Kim Jong-un to North Korea’s Nuclear Weapons Institute, the Korean Central News Agency (KCNA) announced that North Korea is able to
conduct an “ultra-powerful electromagnetic pulse (EMP) attack over a wide area.”

11 Over ten years have already passed since North Korea conducted its first nuclear test in October 2006. Furthermore, North Korea has conducted six nuclear tests to date. This timetable for technology
development and the number of tests are reaching levels that are by no means inadequate, even when compared to the processes of developing technologies to miniaturize and lighten nuclear
weapons in the United States, former Soviet Union, the United Kingdom, France, and China. The 2020 Defense White Paper of the ROK assesses that “North Korea’s ability to miniaturize nuclear
weapons seems to have reached a considerable level.”

12 The 2020 Defense White Paper of the ROK noted that the explosive yield of the sixth nuclear test was approximately 50 kt, significantly larger than the yield of the past tests and that this was assessed
to be a hydrogen bomb test. North Korea also insisted that its fourth nuclear test, conducted in January 2016, was a hydrogen bomb test. However, given that the yield of that test is estimated at 6
to 7 kts, it is difficult to conceive that this was a hydrogen bomb test as generally defined.

**Chapter**


after announcing a commitment to full denuclearization
of the Korean Peninsula, North Korea has continued
nuclear development[14] and that a uranium enrichment
facility not disclosed by North Korea exists.
In light of the above, it is now necessary to keep a
close watch on what kind of concrete actions it will take
towards the dismantlement of all WMDs and all ballistic
missiles of all ranges in a complete, verifiable and
irreversible manner.

**(2) Biological and Chemical Weapons**
North Korea is an extremely closed regime. In addition,
most materials, equipment, and technology used for
manufacturing biological and chemical weapons are for
both military and civilian uses, which in turn facilitates
camouflage. For these reasons, details of the status
of North Korea’s biological and chemical weapons


development and arsenals are unclear. However, with
regard to chemical weapons, North Korea is suspected
to have several facilities capable of producing chemical
agents and already a substantial stockpile of such agents.
North Korea is also thought to have some infrastructure
for the production of biological weapons.[15] Possession
of sarin, VX, mustard and other chemical weapons, and
of anthrax, smallpox, pest and other biological agents
that could be used as biological weapons have been
pointed out.
The possibility cannot be denied that North Korea is able
to load biological and/or chemical weapons on warheads.

**(3) Ballistic Missiles**
As is the case with WMDs, many of the details of North
Korea’s ballistic missiles are unknown, partly owing
to North Korea’s extremely closed regime. It appears,


14 For example, “Worldwide Threat Assessment,” the U.S. Director of National Intelligence, released in January 2019
15 For example, the 2020 Defense White Paper of the ROK points out that, following the commencement of production in the 1980s, it is estimated that North Korea has a stock of 2,500-5,000 tons of various
chemical weapons stored. It also notes that North Korea likely has the capability to produce a variety of biological weapons including anthrax, smallpox, and pests. Moreover, the U.S. DoD’s “Military and
Security Developments Involving the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea” of May 2018 points out that, “North Korea probably could employ CW [chemical weapons] agents by modifying a variety of i

the night using TELs, often in multiple numbers (since 2014). Some ballistic missiles are said to be equipped with a Maneuverable Reentry Vehicle (MaRV) (since 2017).
(iii) Enhancement of secrecy and instantaneity and the ability to conduct surprise attacks: Launches of SLBMs (since 2016) and promotion of the development of solid-fueled ballistic

missiles (since 2016)
(iv) Irregular trajectories: Launches of short-range ballistic missiles having a shape similar to that of the Russian “Iskander,” which are said to be able to fly at a lower altitude than

conventional ballistic missiles and on an irregular trajectory (since 2019)
(v) Diversification of the forms of launches: Ballistic missile launches assumed to have used a lofted trajectory have been confirmed (since 2016).

however, that North Korea gives high priority to the
development of ballistic missiles out of political and
diplomatic considerations and from the viewpoint of
earning foreign currency, in addition to enhancing its
military capabilities. The ballistic missiles deemed to
have been possessed and developed by North Korea are
the following.[16]

a. Types of Ballistic Missiles Possessed or Developed by
North Korea
(a) Toksa
Toksa is a short-range ballistic missile with a range
estimated to be approximately 120 km. It is transported
and operated on a TEL.[17] It is deemed that Toksa is the
first ballistic missile possessed or developed by North
Korea which adopts a solid fuel propellant.
(b) SRBM launched since 2019
Since 2019, North Korea has launched at least three types
of short-range ballistic missile that are presumed to be
new models. From images published by North Korea, it
can be ascertained that these three types of SRBM were
launched from a wheeled-drive or continuous-tracked


16 According to “Jane’s Sentinel Security Assessment China and Northeast Asia” (accessed in March 2021) North Korea possesses 700 to 1,000 ballistic missiles in total, 45% of which are presumed
to be Scud-class, 45% Nodong-class, and the remaining 10% other intermediate- and long-range ballistic missiles.

17 The signs of a launch from a fixed launcher are easy for the adversary to detect and are vulnerable to attack by the adversary. TEL was developed mainly by the former Soviet Union among others in
order to make the detection of launch signs more difficult and increase survivability. According to the U.S. DoD’s “Military and Security Developments Involving the Democratic People’s Republic of
Korea” of May 2018, North Korea possesses a maximum of 100 TELs for Scuds, 50 TELs for Nodongs, and 50 TELs for IRBMs (Musudans).

As for a TEL-mounted missile launch, it is deemed difficult to detect individual specific signs in advance concerning the detailed location and timing of the launch. This is because it is operated by
being mounted and transported on a TEL, and furthermore, military-related underground facilities are thought to exist all over North Korea.

Along with activities related to the development of ballistic missiles, developments related to the building of TELs require close watch as they concern the operational capabilities of ballistic missiles


-----

TEL, with the characteristic radial exhausts of solid fuelpropelled engines identifiable on each of the images.
All of these missiles appeared in the military parades in
October 2020 and January 2021.
(i) SRBM A
The SRBM (described by North Korea as “new type of
tactical guided weapon”) launched in 2019 on May 4 and
9, July 25, and August 6 are all presumed to have the
same system. Two missiles were launched on each of the
aforementioned dates and flew approximately 200-600
km. In terms of the shape, the launched missiles have
a similarity to that of the Russian short-range ballistic
missile “Iskander.” It is also presumed that this missile is
able to fly at a lower altitude than conventional ballistic
missiles and on an irregular trajectory.
(ii) SRBM B
The SRBM (described by North Korea as “new weapon”
or as “tactical guided weapon”) launched on August 10
and 16, 2019 and on March 21, 2020 are all presumed
to have the same system and to be of a different type
from the aforementioned A-type. Two missiles were
launched on each of the aforementioned dates and flew
approximately 250-400 km. It is also presumed that this
missile is able to fly at a lower altitude than conventional
ballistic missiles and on an irregular trajectory.
(iii) SRBM C
The SRBM (North Korea calls “super-large multiple rocket
launcher”) launched in 2019 on August 24, September
10, October 31, and November 28, and on March 2, 9
and 29, 2020 are all presumed to be of a different type
from the aforementioned A-and B-types. Two missiles
were launched on each of the aforementioned dates and
flew approximately 300-400 km. Some of the intervals
between launches were estimated less than 1 minute,
suggesting that North Korea is trying to improve the
continuous fire capability required for saturation attacks
and the like. Regarding TELs, various types can be

(March 2020) [EPA/Jiji]


confirmed in images published by North Korea.
In addition, North Korea carried out two launches
of what could have been SRBMs on July 31, 2019 and
another two a couple of days later, on August 2.
Through such launches, North Korea appears to
be pursuing enhancement of related technologies and
operational capabilities, including enhancing secrecy
and instantaneity, to make it difficult to detect signs of a
launch, as well as improving its ability to conduct surprise
attacks and its continuous fire capability. Considering the
distances flown, it would appear that not only the ROK,
but also parts of Japan would be within range of some of
the SRBMs launched. There is also a concern that this
short-range ballistic missile technology will be applied to
longer-range missiles in due course.
(c) New type of ballistic missile launched in March
On March 25, 2021, North Korea launched two newtype ballistic missiles (called “new-type tactical guided
missile” by North Korea) that had never been launched
previously. This missile is presumed to have the same
system as the one mounted on the five-axle TEL which
appeared in the military parade in January 2021. The
launched missiles flew approximately 450 km and at a
lower altitude than Scud owned by North Korea.
In addition, from the images published by North Korea,

it can be ascertained that it features solid fuel-propelled
engines from the radial exhaust, which is characteristic of
this type of engine.
(d) Scud
The Scud is a liquid fuel propellant single-stage ballistic
missile and is transported and operated on a TEL.
Scud B and Scud C, a variant of Scud B with extended
range, are SRBMs with ranges estimated to be about
300 km and 500 km, respectively. It is believed that
North Korea has manufactured and deployed them, and
has exported them to the Middle East and other countries.
The Scud ER (Extended Range) is a ballistic missile
that has an extended range due to the extension of the
Scud’s body as well as the reduction in weight of the
warhead, among other factors. The range of a Scud ER
is estimated to reach approximately 1,000 km, and it
appears that a part of Japan falls within this range.
In addition, North Korea is developing a ballistic
missile that appears to be an improvement of the Scud
missile. This ballistic missile was launched on May 29,
2017. A day after the launch, North Korea announced that
it had successfully conducted a test launch of a newly
developed ballistic rocket incorporating a precision
navigation guidance system.
In addition, while the images released by North Korea
show that the ballistic missile was launched from a
continuous track TEL and had what appears to be small
wings on its warhead, i.e., characteristics different from
those of existing Scud missiles, the shape other than the
warhead and length are similar to existing Scud missiles.
Another similarity is that it can be confirmed that the
missile has straight-line exhausts characteristic of a
liquid fuel-propelled engine. It has also been noted that
this ballistic missile is equipped with a MaRV.[18]

Given that North Korea announced that Chairman Kim
Jong-un had ordered the development of ballistic missiles
capable of precision attacks on enemy ships and other
individual targets, the intent appears to be to enhance the
accuracy of ballistic missile attacks.
(e) Nodong
The Nodong is a liquid fuel propelled single-stage
ballistic missile and is transported and operated on a
TEL. It is assessed to have a range of about 1,300 km,
reaching almost all of Japan.
Although the details of Nodong’s performance
have not been confirmed, Nodong may not have the
accuracy to carry out precise strikes on specific target
installations, as this ballistic missile is likely based


on Scud technology. However, it has been suggested
that North Korea is working to increase the Nodong’s
accuracy. In this regard, the launch of an improved
type of ballistic missile (Nodong), aimed at enhancing
accuracy by improving the shape of the warhead
(whose range is deemed to reach approximately 1,500
km through the weight reduction of the warhead), was
confirmed for the first time in the images published by
North Korea a day after the launch of one Scud and two
Nodong missiles on July 19, 2016.
(f) SLBM
(i) SLBM “Pukguksong”
It has been suggested that North Korea is developing
an SLBM and a new submarine which is designed
to carry the SLBM (referred to by North Korea as
“Pukguksong”). Since it announced in May 2015
through its media that it conducted a successful
test launch of an SLBM, it has made public SLBM
“Pukguksong” launches on four occasions.[19]

Judging from the images and footage that it has
made public so far, North Korea may have succeeded in
operating the “cold launch system,” in which the missile
is ignited after it is ejected into the air. Moreover, in the
launches in April and August 2016, it appears, based on
observations such as the shape of the flame coming out
of the missile and the color of the smoke, that the solid
fuel-propelled system was adopted.
A ballistic missile presumed to be an SLBM
“Pukguksong” has been confirmed in flight in the
direction of Japan, launched from the vicinity of Sinpo,
on the east coast of North Korea, on August 24, 2016.
The SLBM flew approximately 500 km. Considering that
this was its first SLBM to fly approximately 500 km, the
possibility cannot be denied that North Korea had striven
to solve the problems through the preceding launches and
achieved certain technological progress.
Furthermore, it is predicted that the ballistic missile
that was launched at this time flew on a somewhat higher
than nominal trajectory, compared to the normal altitude
of a ballistic missile with a firing range of 500 km. If it
were launched on a nominal trajectory, the firing range is
expected to surpass 1,000 km.
North Korea’s “Pukguksong” SLBMs are believed to
be launched from a Gorae-class submarine (displacement
1,500 tons). North Korea has one such submarine. It is
also pointed out that North Korea seeks to develop a
larger submarine to launch SLBMs.[20]


**Chapter**


18 For example, according to “Jane’s Sentinel Security Assessment China and Northeast Asia” (accessed in March 2021), the launch on May 29, 2017, was presumed to have been the first launch of a
short-range ballistic missile based on a Scud missile, equipped with a MaRV, suggesting that North Korea has made advances in its precision guidance systems.

19 On May 9, 2015, North Korea announced that it had succeeded in a test launch of an SLBM. On January 8, 2016, it released footage of an SLBM test launch that appears to be different from the one
unveiled in May 2015. On April 24 and August 25, 2016, it again announced that it had succeeded in SLBM test launches. Moreover, the MOD predicts that North Korea also launched one ballistic
missile presumed to be an SLBM on July 9, 2016, although North Korea has not made an announcement about the launches.


-----

(ii) SLBM “Pukguksong-3”
On October 2, 2019, North Korea launched what was
presumed to be SLBM (described by North Korea
as a “Pukguksong-3”) that differed from the SLBM
“Pukguksong.” The missile in question flew for about
450 km and is presumed to have fallen into Japan’s
exclusive economic zone (EEZ). As the ballistic missile
launched on this occasion reached a maximum altitude of
about 900 km, it is surmised to have been launched on a
lofted trajectory. If launched on a nominal trajectory, it
is estimated that it could have a range of approximately
2,000 km. The characteristic radial exhausts of solid fuelpropelled engines are identifiable on images published
by North Korea. The ballistic missile in question could
potentially have been launched from underwater launch
test equipment.
It is deemed that through developing the SLBM and a
new submarine to carry it, North Korea intends to diversify
its ballistic missile attack capabilities and improve
survivability. In addition, North Korea showcased two
possible new types of submarine-launched ballistic
missiles (SLBM) referred to as “Pukguksong-4” and
“Pukguksong-5” in the military parades in October 2020
and January 2021 respectively.
(g) Ballistic Missile Modified from the SLBM
North Korea launched a ballistic missile on both
February 12 and May 21, 2017, both of which appeared
to be a modified version of the SLBM “Pukguksong”
for ground launch (referred to by North Korea as
“Pukguksong-2”). This ballistic missile is estimated to
have flown approximately 500 km on both occasions,
on somewhat higher trajectories than normal. If it were
launched on a nominal trajectory, the firing range is
assessed to surpass 1,000 km. A day after the launch
on February 12, North Korea announced that it was
developed as a ground-to-ground ballistic missile based
on the results of the August 2016 SLBM launch. It also
announced a day after the launch on May 21, 2017 that
it had again successfully conducted the test launch of
the Pukguksong-2 and that Chairman Kim Jong-un had
authorized its “operational deployment.”
Moreover, the launch by a “cold launch system,” in
which the missile is ignited after it is ejected into the
air from a continuous track TEL, and the characteristic
radial exhausts of solid fuel-propelled engines, can be
confirmed from each of the images that North Korea
released. It has the characteristics of appearing to be
using “cold launch system” and solid fuel-propelled
engines in common with the SLBM “Pukguksong.”
Given that North Korea has made references to its


operational deployment, there is a possibility that North
Korea will newly deploy a solid fuel-propelled engine
that includes Japan within its firing range.
(h) Intermediate-Range Ballistic Missile (IRBM)-Class
To date North Korea has launched three liquid fuelpropelled IRBM-class ballistic missiles (referred to by
North Korea as “Hwasong-12”). This ballistic missile
was launched on May 14, 2017 and based on this flight
pattern, it is presumed that the ballistic missile was
launched on a lofted trajectory. Had it been launched
on a nominal trajectory, the maximum firing range is
assessed to be close to approximately 5,000 km. In
addition, the straight-line exhausts characteristic of a
liquid fuel propelled engine can be confirmed from the
images released by North Korea a day after the launch,
suggesting that the ballistic missile uses liquid fuel.
On August 29 and September 15, 2017, single missiles
of this class were launched and flew over Japan’s territory
in the vicinity of the Oshima Peninsula and Cape Erimo.
These launches were the first cases of North Korea
launching what it calls ballistic missiles that flew over
Japan’s territory.
In view of their flight paths, these missiles appear
to demonstrate a certain level of function as an IRBM.
Also, the fact that missiles that overflew Japan were
launched in succession in a short time period would
suggest that North Korea is steadily improving its
ballistic missile capabilities.
Furthermore, although at the time of launches in May
and August 2017 the missiles were confirmed to have
been launched after being separated from the wheel-drive
TEL, at the time of the September launch the missile was
confirmed to have been launched while still attached to
the wheel-drive TEL. Considering this point, together
with North Korea’s claims at the time of the launch
that it was for the purposes of “confirming practical
operational procedures” and “realize the potential of the
‘Hwasong-12,’” there is a possibility that North Korea is
improving its practical operational capabilities.
In 2016 North Korea conducted repeated launches
of an IRBM-class ballistic missile that is presumed to
be the Musudan,[21] but although the missile launched in
June flew for a certain distance on a lofted trajectory,
the fact that there were two successive launch failures in
October would suggest that there may still be obstacles
remaining towards the operationalization of the
Musudan and that North Korea may be concentrating
on the development and operationalization of the
“Hwasong-12” as an IRBM instead.


**Chapter**


21 It has been suggested that, given its range of between 2,500 and 4,000 km, all parts of Japan and Guam may fall within the Musudan’s firing range. Similar to its Scud and Nodong counterparts,
it is liquid fuel-propelled and is loaded onto a TEL to transport and operate. It has been noted that Musudan is a revamped version of the Russian SLBM SS-N-6 that North Korea acquired in the


-----

(i) Intercontinental-Range Ballistic Missile (ICBM)-Class
(i) ICBM-class “Hwasong-14”
North Korea has launched ICBM-class ballistic missile
(referred to by North Korea as “Hwasong-14”) on July
4 and 28, 2017. From the flight pattern, it is presumed
that the two ballistic missiles were launched on a lofted
trajectory. If they were to have been launched on a
normal trajectory, it is estimated that they would have a
maximum range of at least 5,500 km.
On July 4, the day of the launch, North Korea made
an “important announcement,” announcing that it had
successfully conducted a test launch of a new type of
ICBM. Furthermore, on the day following the July 28
launch, North Korea announced that the “nuclear bomb
detonation device” had functioned normally, emphasizing
that the safety of the warhead in an atmospheric reentry
environment had been made maintained. This suggests
that North Korea is aiming to operationalize long-range
ballistic missiles.
Based on images released by North Korea, the
“Hwasong-14”-type ICBM-class ballistic missiles have
the following in common with the “Hwasong-12”-type
IRBM-class ballistic missile: (1) the configuration of
engine system (one main engine and four auxiliary
engines); (2) the shape of the lower part of the propulsion
system (conical shape); and (3) the straight-line flame of
liquid-propulsion systems can be confirmed. Based on
these facts and the respective ranges that can be estimated
for the missiles, it can be assumed that the ICBM-class
ballistic missile was possibly developed on the basis of
the “Hwasong-12”-type IRBM-class ballistic missile.
Also based on images published by North Korea, it can
be confirmed that the “Hwasong-14”-type ICBM-class
ballistic missiles had been mounted on the wheeled eightaxle TEL similar to KN-08/14 (see (k) below). However,
it can be confirmed from the images at the time of the
launches that they were launched from simplified launch
pads, not TELs. Furthermore, the images suggest that the
missile was of two-stage construction.
(ii) ICBM-class “Hwasong-15”
On November 29, 2017, North Korea launched a single
missile that is presumed to have been an intercontinentalrange ballistic missile-class ballistic missile (referred
to by North Korea as “Hwasong-15”). From the flight
pattern it is presumed that the missile was launched
on a lofted trajectory. On the day of the launch, North
Korea made a “government statement,” declaring
that it had successfully conducted a test launch of the
“Hwasong-15,” a newly developed type of ICBM with
the capability to strike all areas of the U.S. mainland, and
asserting that it had now completed development of its


Image publicly released by North Korea when it launched an ICBM-class “Hwasong-15”
(November 2017) [AFP/Jiji]

state nuclear force.
The following points would suggest that this missile
is an ICBM-class ballistic missile, different from the
“Hwasong-14”-type ballistic missile: (1) its flight
distance and altitude; (2) North Korea’s announcement
(the successful test launch of a new type of ICBM, the
“Hwasong-15” was announced); (3) the fact that the
missile was deployed on a previously unseen nine-axle
wheel-drive TEL; and (4) shape of the warhead nose
being more rounded than previous missiles. In addition,
according to images released by North Korea, the missile
was of a two-stage design, and it can be confirmed that
it was removed from the TEL prior to launch and that its
straight-line exhausts are characteristic of a liquid fuel
propelled engine.
Furthermore, based on the flight altitude, distance
flown and released images, it can be assumed that this
missile could have a range in excess of 10,000 km,
depending on the weight of the warhead deployed, etc.,
thus renewing concerns over the increasing ranges of
North Korea’s ballistic missiles.
In addition, although the wheel-drive TELs possessed
by North Korea are thought to be modified versions of
Russian and Chinese TELs, it is noteworthy that North
Korea has claimed to have developed its own TEL.
(j) Taepodong-2
Taepodong-2 are long-range ballistic missiles launched
from fixed launch pads.[22] Taepodong-2 is believed to use
in its first stage, four engines, each of which is developed
based on the technologies of Nodong, and the same type
of engine in its second stage. Its range is estimated to
be approximately 6,000 km for the two-stage type, while
the range of its three-stage variant can be more than
approximately 10,000 km assuming that the weight of the
warhead is not over approximately 1 ton. Taepodong-2

missiles and its variants have been launched a total of
five times so far.
Most recently, in February 2016, North Korea
conducted a launch of a missile disguised as a “satellite”
from the Tongch’ang-ri district in the northwest coastline
of North Korea using a Taepodong-2 variant after
notifying international organizations. It is assessed that
North Korea’s long-range ballistic missiles’ technological
reliability had been advanced by this launch because it
is estimated that (1) it successfully launched two similar
types of ballistic missiles in a row; (2) the missile flew in
almost the same way as the last launch; and (3) it put an
object into orbit around the Earth.
Accordingly, it is believed that these test launches
of long-range ballistic missiles can contribute to the
development of shorter-range missiles in such ways
as increasing the range and payload capability and
improving the circular error probability (CEP). Also,
related technology such as the separation technology
of multi-stage propelling devices and the technology
of posture control and thrust modulation of long-range
ballistic missiles can be applied to other middle-range and
long-range ballistic missiles that North Korea is newly
developing. Therefore, the launch may lead not only to
the improvement of other types of its ballistic missiles
including Nodong but also to the advancement of North
Korea’s entire ballistic missile program including the
development of new ballistic missiles and diversification
of attack measure.
(k) KN-08/KN-14
The details of the new missile “KN-08” which was
showcased at the military parade in April 2012 and July
2013 are unknown. However, the missile is believed to be
an ICBM. At the military parade in October 2015, a new
missile thought to be the “KN-08” was showcased with
a different-shaped warhead from the previous version.
The new missile, considered a variant of the “KN-08,” is
called the “KN-14.”
b. Major Trends in Ballistic Missile Launches
North Korea has repeatedly launched various types
of ballistic missiles. In particular, since 2016 it has
conducted more than 70 launches, including launches of
what appear to be new types of missiles.
As for trends in North Korea’s ballistic missile
launches, the following characteristics have been
observed. Firstly, it appears that North Korea seeks
to increase the firing range of ballistic missiles. An
intercontinental-range ballistic missile-class ballistic
missile launched in November 2017, which could have
a range in excess of 10,000 km, depending on the weight
of the warhead deployed, etc.
Although it is considered necessary for the
operationalization of long-range ballistic missiles to


further verify technology for protecting the re-entry
vehicle from the ultrahigh temperature that is generated
during the atmospheric re-entry of the warhead part,
North Korea, with announcements such as the one in
November 2017 on the day of the launch of what is
believed to have been an intercontinental-range ballistic
missile-class ballistic missile, claiming that it had reverified warhead reliability in a reentry environment, is
displaying an intention to seek to secure and enhance
technology aimed at the operationalization of long-range
ballistic missiles.
North Korea announced twice in December 2019 that
it had conducted a “crucial test” at its Sohae satellite
launching station in Tongch’ang-ri district. It has been
pointed out that these were ICBM-class ballistic missile
engine tests. Furthermore, in the military parades in
October 2020, a possible new type of ICBM-class
ballistic missile appeared.
Should North Korea make further progress in the
development of ballistic missiles, including the acquiring
of reentry technologies, it may come to have a one-sided
understanding that it has secured a strategic deterrence
against the United States. However, if North Korea has
such a false sense of confidence and recognition regarding
its deterrence, it could lead to an increase and escalation
of military provocations by North Korea in the region
and could create situations that are deeply worrying also
for Japan.
North Korea is presumed to have acquired the
atmospheric re-entry technologies required for the
operationalization of Nodong and Scud-ER ballistic
missiles, within whose range Japan lies, suggesting that
it already has the ability to attack Japan with nuclear
weapons fitted to these ballistic missiles.
Secondly, North Korea may be aiming to enhance
the accuracy, continuous fire capability, and operational
capabilities necessary for saturation attacks and the like.
As for the Scud and Nodong, which are already deployed,

since 2014, they have been launched from unprecedented
locations, cutting across the Korean Peninsula, in the
early morning and late hours of the night using TELs,
often in multiple numbers. This indicates that North
Korea is capable of launching Scuds and Nodongs from
any place and at any time, from which it is deemed
that it has increased confidence in the performance and
reliability of its ballistic missiles.
As for Scuds and Nodongs, since the August 2016
Nodong launch, there have been launches where it is
presumed that warheads fell in Japan’s EEZ, posing
a major threat to Japan’s security. The four ballistic
missiles, apparently Scud ERs, launched on March 6,
2017, were launched simultaneously.
It is possible that through these launches, North
Korea’s intentions are not only research and development
of ballistic missiles but also the enhancement of their
operational capabilities. Since Chairman Kim Jong-un
has repeatedly instructed the military troops to reject
formality and conduct practical training, it can be
considered that these instructions underpin the launches
of ballistic missiles that have already been deployed.
Some have noted that a ballistic missile which appears
to have been modified from the Scud missile launched
in May 2017 is equipped with a MaRV. Furthermore,
images of the 2019 ballistic missile launches published
by North Korea show that the missiles were launched
from different places and hit the specific target.
This suggests that North Korea is aiming to enhance
the accuracy of attack by upgrading ballistic missiles
that have already been deployed and developing new
ballistic missiles.
Furthermore, in the short-range ballistic missile
launches on November 28, 2019 and March 2, 2020,
the interval between launching the two missiles on both
occasions was estimated at less than 1 minute, suggesting
that North Korea is trying to improve the continuous fire
capability required for saturation attacks and the like.
In recent years, North Korea also appears to have been
striving to improve its practical operational capabilities,
conducting target practice using a combination of SRBMs
and various types of artillery.
Thirdly, North Korea appears to be seeking to improve
its ability to conduct surprise attacks by enhancing
secrecy and instantaneity to make it difficult to detect
signs of a launch.
Using a TEL or submarine, a ballistic missile can be
launched from any point, making it difficult to detect
signs of a launch in advance. North Korea has repeatedly
launched ballistic missiles from TELs and SLBMs.
In addition, all the ballistic missiles launched since
2019 appear to use solid fuel. It is therefore believed
that North Korea is proceeding with the development


of solid-fueled ballistic missiles. Generally solid fuelpropelled ballistic missiles are preloaded with solid
fuel, and therefore, they can be launched instantly and
the signs of their launch are more difficult to detect.
Furthermore, they can be reloaded more quickly,
and they are relatively easier to store and handle in
comparison to liquid fuel-propelled missiles. In this
respect, they are considered to be superior militarily.
From these factors, North Korea is deemed to be aiming
to enhance its surprise attack capabilities.
Fourthly, North Korea is deemed to have been
developing ballistic missiles that fly at low altitudes
on irregular trajectories, in an attempt to breach other
countries’ missile defense networks. The SRBMs A and B
fly at a lower altitude than conventional ballistic missiles,
and they seem to be able to fly on an irregular trajectory.
The prevailing view is that these types of missiles are
designed to breach missile defense networks.
Fifthly, North Korea may be attempting to diversify
the forms of launches. It has been confirmed that the June
22, 2016, May 14, July 4, July 28, and November 29,
2017, and October 2, 2019 ballistic missile launches used
a lofted trajectory, in which missiles are launched to high
altitudes at higher angles than normal. Generally, when
a launch is made on a lofted trajectory, interception is
considered to be more difficult.
North Korea is proceeding with ballistic missile
development at an extremely rapid pace and is believed
already to have the ability to attack Japan with nuclear
weapons fitted to Nodong and Scud-ER ballistic missiles,
within whose range our nation lies.
Furthermore, North Korea has developed more
advanced missile-related technologies in recent years,
developing the SRBMs that use solid fuel and fly at lower
altitudes than conventional ballistic missiles and on
irregular trajectories. North Korea is therefore believed to
be trying to breach missile defense networks by making
it more difficult to detect signs of a launch and conduct
early detection and interception. There are concerns that
such advanced technologies will be applied to longerrange missiles.
Thus, North Korea is relentlessly pursuing increasingly
complex and diverse modes of attack and is steadily
strengthening and improving its attack capabilities. These
enhancements in its capabilities make early detection of
the signs of a launch and the interception of the missiles
more difficult, thereby posing new challenges for the
information gathering, early warning, and interception
postures of relevant countries, including Japan. It is
necessary that we continue to carefully monitor moves by
North Korea regarding its ballistic missile development.

**(4) Future Trends in Weapons Development**
At the 8th Congress of the KWP in January 2021, North
Korea stated that it would increase “nuclear war deterrent”
and develop “the most powerful military strength.” North
Korea also specifically mentioned the development of
various weapons as its future goals and showed a stance
of enhancing its military power.
With regard to nuclear and missile capabilities, North
Korea expressed its intention to develop “tactical nuclear
weapons” and continuously advance the production
of “super-sized nuclear warheads.” North Korea also
mentioned the promotion of research and development
of multi-warhead technology, “hypersonic gliding
flight warheads,” nuclear-powered submarines, and
solid fuel-propelled ICBM, demonstrating its stance of
relentlessly pursuing increasingly complex and diverse
modes of attack.
Besides the nuclear and missile capabilities,
development of reconnaissance means, including military
reconnaissance satellites and unmanned aerial vehicles,
was also mentioned.
These goals demonstrate North Korea’s stance of
following the trends of major countries based on military
science and technological trends, and displays the
improvements of its military capabilities both domestically
and overseas. In addition, for example, North Korea has
mentioned its plan to implement the development and
introduction of “hypersonic gliding flight warheads” and
the operation of military reconnaissance satellites “in the
near future.” This suggests that North Korea will focus
more on the realization of the goals described above, in
the same way as its ballistic missile development.
Furthermore, in the military parades in October 2020
and January 2021, a possible new type of ICBM-class
ballistic missile, two possible new types of submarinelaunched ballistic missiles (SLBM) referred to as
“Pukguksong-4” and “Pukguksong-5,” and a new type of
ballistic missile (launched in March 2021) appeared. Of
these missiles, there is a view regarding the possible new
type of ICBM-class ballistic missile that its power could
be enhanced by increasing the weight of the warhead and
it could be improved to become a multi-warhead missile,
which is generally considered more difficult to intercept
than a single-warhead.
In light of the situation above, it will continue to
require paying close attention with great interest to the
trend of North Korea’s weapon development.


**4 Domestic Affairs**

**(1) Developments Related to the Kim Jong-un Regime**
In North Korea, the power base centered on Chairman
Kim is being solidified. The constitution was amended in
April and August 2019, strengthening Chairman Kim’s
authority through such provisions as the stipulation that
the Chairman of the State Affairs Commission is “the
supreme leader of the Democratic People’s Republic of
Korea who represents the state.” It is pointed out that
North Korea is run under the leadership of the party. In
January 2021, the 8th Congress of the KWP was held and
Chairman Kim was appointed general secretary of the
Workers’ Party.
On the other hand, with senior officials unable to dispute
the decisions of Chairman Kim Jong-un due to an atrophy
effect created by the frequent executions, demotions, and
dismissals of senior officials, it is believed that there is
growing uncertainty, including over the possibility of
North Korea turning to military provocations without
making adequate diplomatic considerations. In addition,
it has been suggested that there is declining social control
caused by widening wealth disparities and information
inflow from other countries. In this regard, attention will
be paid to the stability of the regime.


**Chapter**


**(2) Economic Conditions**
In the economic domain, North Korea has been facing
chronic stagnation and energy and food shortages due
to the vulnerability of its socialist planned economy
and diminishing economic cooperation with the former
Soviet Union and East European countries following the
end of the Cold War.[23]

Furthermore, the strengthening of sanctions by
countries including Japan and the United States, and the
sanctions of the related UN Security Council resolutions
in response to the implementation of nuclear tests and
missile launches can be assumed to have had a certain
effect, when considered together with the severe
economic situation of North Korea. Accordingly, if
China, North Korea’s largest trading partner, and other
relevant countries continue to rigorously implement
sanctions, an even more severe economic situation could
beset North Korea.
In 2020, COVID-19 infection and natural disasters, in
addition to sanctions, seemed to have had a significant
impact on North Korea’s economy. At the 8th Congress
of the KWP in January 2021, Chairman Kim remarked
that, due to “unexpected challenges,” “the objectives for


23 In recent years, North Korean fishing boats and Chinese fishing boats have been conducting illegal operations within Japan’s exclusive economic zone (EEZ) surrounding Yamato tai, creating a situation
that threatens the safety of Japanese fishing boats operating in the EEZ. In this sea area, the Fisheries Agency and the Japan Coast Guard in cooperation crack down on illegal operations by foreign
fishing boats. See the Cabinet Office Annual Report, “The situation of the oceans and the implemented measures by the Government with regard to the oceans,” the White paper on Fisheries and the

that the ballistic missile it launched in March 2021 had the
irregular trajectory features.
Additionally, in October 2019, North Korea launched its new
“Pukguksong-3” submarine-launched ballistic missile (SLBM).
The development of SLBMs could make it more difficult
to detect signs of a launch, improving its surprise attack
capabilities. Although there have been no SLBM launches since,
possible new types of SLBM referred to as “Pukguksong-4”
and “Pukguksong-5” appeared in military parades in October
2020 and January 2021. It is also pointed out that North Korea
is developing a new type of submarine that is believed to be A possible new SLBM that appeared at a military parade in January 2021

capable of carrying SLBMs. North Korea is believed to be


the growth of the national economy fell a long way short
of implementation and consequently the people’s living
standards could not be improved remarkably.”
At the 8th Congress of the KWP, Chairman Kim stated
that “above all, we should launch a do-or-die struggle
to implement without fail the new five-year plan for the
national economic development.” It therefore appears
that North Korea regards the rebuilding of the economy
as being of paramount importance. Nevertheless, as North
Korea is unlikely to carry out any structural reforms that
could lead to the destabilization of its current ruling


system, it faces various challenges in making fundamental
improvements to its current economic situation.
North Korea is presumed to be evading the UN
Security Council sanctions by conducting ship-toship transfers prohibited by the UN Security Council
resolutions.[24] The final report of the UN Security
Council’s Panel of Experts assisting the North Korea
Sanctions Committee (“Final Report of the Panel of
Experts submitted pursuant to resolution 2515 (2020)”)
released, in April 2021, points out that, during the
January-September period in 2020, North Korea illicitly


24 Between the beginning of 2018 and the end of March 2021, MSDF patrol aircraft and ships have observed 24 cases in which a North Korean-flagged tanker and a foreign-flagged vessel were
anchored side-by-side on the high seas. As a result of comprehensive judgment by the government, there are strong suspicions that the observed vessels were engaging in illicit ship-to-ship transfers.


-----

**(2) Relations with the ROK**
In 2018, substantial progress was realized in interKorean relations. The inter-Korean summit meeting
was held in April, resulting in the issuance of the
Panmunjom Declaration, which confirmed among other
matters that the two parties agreed to completely cease
all hostile acts against each other in every domain, and
confirmed the common goal of realizing a nuclear-free
Korean Peninsula. In addition, in another inter-Korean
summit meeting held in May, Chairman Kim Jong-un
reiterated his desire for the complete denuclearization
of the Korean Peninsula. Furthermore, at the interKorean summit meeting in September, Pyongyang Joint
Declaration of September 2018, which referred to an
ending of military hostilities, was issued. In addition,
the “Agreement on the Implementation of the Historic
Panmunjom Declaration in the Military Domain,” which
prescribed concrete measures to ease inter-Korean
military tensions, was signed.
However, 2019 saw no major advances in inter-Korean
dialogue and cooperation programs, while in 2020 there
was a temporary increase in tension seen in the interKorean relationship. In June 2020, First Vice Department
Director of the Central Committee of the KWP Kim
Yo-jong released a statement in reacting against a North
Korean defectors group that had distributed flyers
blaming Chairman Kim Jong-un. Since then, North Korea
has shown some moves such as the explosion of the InterKorean Joint Liaison Office in Kaesong, announcement
of a review of military action plan, which contains the
strengthening of military posture along the DMZ and
resumption of military training and exercises (it was later
announced that this was suspended).
Meanwhile, in regard to the case of the shooting of
a government official of the ROK which occurred at
sea near the inter-Korean border in September 2020,
Chairman Kim Jong-un expressed an apology. In his
speech at the military parade in October of the same year,
Chairman Kim remarked that he would hope for the day
to come when the North and South take each other’s
hands facing each other again. In the 8th Congress of
the KWP in January 2021, Chairman Kim mentioned
that it would be no exaggeration to say that the interKorean relationships have been brought back to the time
before the publication of the Panmunjom Declaration,
which was signed at the inter-Korean summit in April
2018. On the other hand, Chairman Kim also said that,
depending on the attitude of the ROK side, the interKorean relationship could return to the new starting
point for peace and prosperity. In March 2021, regarding
the U.S.-ROK combined command post training, Vice
Department Director of the Central Committee of KWP
Kim Yo-jong released a statement blaming the exercises

the annual aggregate 500,000-barrel cap several times
mainly by ship-to-ship transfers.

against North Korea)

**5 Relations with Other Countries**


**(1) Relations with the United States**
In June 2018, the historic first-ever U.S.-North Korea
summit meeting was held and both sides confirmed
that they would join their efforts to build a lasting and
stable peace regime on the Korean Peninsula. Chairman
Kim Jong-un made clear his intention to work towards
the complete denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula,
and confirmed that negotiations would continue with the
United States.
However, the second U.S.-North Korea summit
meeting in February 2019 ended without any agreement
being reached between the two countries.
At the December 2019 Plenary Meeting of the Central
Committee of the KWP, Chairman Kim stated that, since
the United States was holding U.S.-ROK joint military
exercises, there were no grounds for North Korea to be
unilaterally bound any longer by a commitment that no
other party honors. He also announced that there will
never be denuclearization on the Korean Peninsula,
and that North Korea will continue developing strategic
weapons until the United States rolls back its hostile
policy towards North Korea. Furthermore, Chairman Kim
remarked that North Korea would maintain its nuclear
deterrence against the United States’ nuclear threat and
that the scope and depth of the buildup of the deterrent
would be coordinated depending on the future approach
of the United States.
Chairman Kim, at the 8th Congress of the KWP in
January 2021, described the United States as its “principal
enemy,” and said that the policy toward North Korea of
the United States would not change regardless of who
would be in power. On the other hand, Chairman Kim
also remarked that the key to establishing a new U.S.North Korea relationship would be the withdrawal of the
hostile policy by the United States.
While the Biden administration of the United States,
inaugurated in January 2021, intends to work to reduce
the threats posed by North Korea’s growing nuclear and
missile programs standing shoulder-to-shoulder with the
ROK and Japan, attention will be paid to the future trends
of the situation.
However, no concrete progress has yet been observed in
the North Korea’s dismantlement of WMDs and missiles.

In this way, North Korea has been utilizing a carrot

ROK),[25] suggesting North Korea’s dependence on China.
With regard to the situation in North Korea and
its nuclear issue, China has expressed support for
denuclearization on the Korean Peninsula, for peace and
stability on the Korean Peninsula, and solving problems
through dialogue and consultations. While it has endorsed
the series of UN Security Council Resolutions, which
strengthen sanctions on North Korea. It has also stated that
sanctions alone will be unable to achieve a fundamental
solution to the nuclear issue and that a solution should be
found through dialogue and consultations. In this respect,
China has expressed support for the U.S.-North Korea
dialogue, including U.S.-North Korea summit meetings.
China, as well as North Korea and Russia, insists that
denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula should be
gradual and simultaneous, with relevant countries taking
corresponding measures.


**(3) Relations with Other Countries**
(i) Relations with China
China is a vital political and economic partner for North
Korea and maintains a degree of influence on North
Korea. The China-North Korea Treaty on Friendship,
Cooperation and Mutual Assistance, which was
concluded in 1961, is still in force. In addition, China is
currently North Korea’s biggest trade partner. In 2019,
trade volume between China and North Korea was very
large, accounting for over 90% of North Korea’s total
trade (excluding trade between North Korea and the

Since March 2018, the China-North Korea summit
meeting has been held five times. At the 8th Congress
of the KWP in January 2021, Chairman Kim mentioned
that those summit meetings had deepened “strategic
communication” and “mutual understanding” between
the two countries.
(ii) Relations with Russia
Concerning North Korea’s nuclear issue, Russia, along
with China, has expressed support for the denuclearization
on the Korean Peninsula and early resumption of the
Six-Party Talks. Although Russia endorsed UN Security
Council Resolution 2397, adopted in December 2017, it
emphasized that pressure on North Korea should make

With regard to its North Korea policy, the Moon Jaein administration is placing emphasis on improving the
inter-Korean relationship and easing tensions. How the
North Korea policy of the Moon administration will
impact inter-Korean relations will continue to require
close attention.
The U.S. Forces, mainly the Army, have been stationed
in the ROK since the ceasefire of the Korean War. The
ROK has established very close security arrangements
with the United States primarily based on the U.S.ROK Mutual Defense Treaty. The U.S. Forces Korea

At the 8th Congress of the KWP in January 2021,
Chairman Kim referred to laying “a cornerstone for
the expansion of friendly relations with Russia” as the
outcome since the 7th Congress of the KWP.
(iii) Relations with Other Countries
It has been reported that North Korea has cooperative
relationships with countries such as Iran, Syria, Pakistan,
Myanmar, and Cuba in military affairs including arms
trade and military technology transfer.

See Chapter 3, Section 6-4 (Growing Concerns about Transfer and

Proliferation of WMDs and Other Technologies), p. 196

as an enemy was eliminated. Instead, the white paper
states as follows: “The Republic of Korea’s armed forces
regard any forces that threaten and encroach upon our
sovereignty, territory, people and assets as our enemies.”
In addition, the white paper emphasizes the importance of
omni-directional response to security threats. The 2020
Defense White Paper of the ROK, published in February
2021 did not contain any expressions describing North
Korea as an enemy.
The ROK has continued to undertake reforms of its
national defense. In recent years, in July 2018, the ROK
released the “Defense Reform 2.0,” which has set the
following three main goals: making omni-directional
response to security threats, enhancing military power
based on advanced science and technology and developing
armed forces appropriate for a developed country. This
plan calls for continued promotion of efforts to secure
combat capabilities necessary for responding to the threat
from North Korea and also includes the reduction of the
troops and the mandatory military service period.


**Chapter**


**2 Defense Policies and Defense Reform of**
**the ROK**

The ROK has a defensive weakness, namely, its capital
Seoul, which has a population of approximately 10
million, is situated close to the DMZ. The ROK has set
the National Defense Objective as follows: “to protect the
country from external military threats and invasions, to
support peaceful unification, and to contribute to regional
stability and world peace.”
As one of the “external military threats,” the ROK,
in its Defense White Paper, used to designate North
Korea as the “main enemy” or state that “the North
Korean regime and its armed forces…will remain as
our enemies.” In the ROK Defense White Paper 2018,
published in January 2019, while continuing to describe
North Korea’s WMDs as a threat to the peace and stability
of the Korean Peninsula the designation of the country


**3 Military Posture of the ROK**

The ROK’s military capacity is as follows. The ground
forces consist of 19 army divisions with approximately
460,000 personnel and 2 marine divisions with
approximately 29,000 personnel; the naval forces consist
of 230 vessels with a total displacement of approximately
260,000 tons; and the air forces (Air Force and Navy
combined) consist of approximately 640 combat aircraft.
The ROK has been modernizing its military forces —
not only its Army but also its Navy and Air Force — in
order to establish an omni-directional defense posture
to deal with future potential threats, not least threats
from North Korea. The Navy has been introducing
submarines light aircraft carriers large transport ships


-----

and domestically built destroyers. The Air Force is
currently promoting a program for the installation of the
F-35A as a next-generation fighter with stealth property.
In November 2017, the ROK Government announced
a revision of its missile guidelines, which were agreed
by the U.S. and ROK governments in 1979 and stipulate
the range of ballistic missiles it possesses; the revision
included the elimination of warhead weight limits on
ballistic missiles, in order to enhance deterrence against
military provocation by North Korea. Furthermore, to
address North Korean nuclear and missile threats, as well
as expanding the missile capabilities of the ROK Forces,
the ROK is engaging in efforts to build a “strategic strike
system,” which would use missiles and other means to
launch rapid preemptive strikes directly targeting the
North Korean command, and also a missile defense
system called Korea Air and Missile Defense (KAMD).
In addition, the focus of defense has changed from
responding to the threat of North Korean missiles to an
omnidirectional response to security threats.
In terms of ballistic missiles, the ROK appears to have
operationally deployed Hyunmoo-2 missiles with an
estimated range of 300-800 km and is believed to have
made a successful test launch of Hyunmoo-4 with a twotons warhead weight and 800 km firing range in 2020,
following the abolition of warhead weight limits in the
2017 revision of the missile guidelines.
With regard to cruise missiles, the ROK appears to
have operationally deployed the Hyunmoo-3 surface-tosurface cruise missile, which is believed to have a range
of about 500-1,500 km, and Haeseong series ship-toship/ ship-to-surface cruise missiles, which are believed
to have a maximum range of 1,000-1,500 km. The Dosan
Ahn Changho submarine and the arsenal ship expected
to be introduced under the 2020-2024 mid-term defense
plan will reportedly be equipped with ballistic missiles
in the future.
Furthermore, at the U.S.-ROK summit meeting held
in May 2021, the conclusion of the ROK’s missile
guidelines was announced.
In recent years, the ROK has actively promoted
equipment export, which reached approximately US$3.2
billion on a contract value basis in 2017. Since 2006, the
amount has increased by nearly 13-fold in 11 years. It
is reported that export items have diversified to include
communication electronics, aircraft, and naval vessels.
Defense spending in FY2021 (regular budget)
increased by about 5.4% from the previous fiscal year
to nearly KRW 52.8401 trillion, marking the 22nd
consecutive year of increases since 2000. According


to the Defense Reform 2.0, the ROK will increase the
defense budget 7.5% on an annual average.

See Fig. I-2-4-8 (Changes in the ROK’s Defense Budget)

**4 U.S.-ROK Alliance and U.S. Forces Korea**


The United States and the ROK have taken various steps
to deepen the U.S.-ROK Alliance in recent years.
The two countries regularly confirm the strengthening
of the U.S.-ROK Alliance at the summit level. For
example, as specific undertakings, the two countries
signed the U.S.-ROK Counter-Provocation Plan for
dealing with North Korea’s provocations in March 2013,
and approved the Tailored Deterrence Strategy, designed
to enhance deterrence against North Korean nuclear and
other WMD threats, at the 45th Security Consultative
Meeting (SCM) in October of the same year.
At the 46th SCM in October 2014, the two countries
agreed on “Concepts and Principles of ROK-U.S.
Alliance Comprehensive Counter-missile Operations (4D
Operational Concept)” to tackle North Korean ballistic
missile threats. At the 47th SCM in November 2015, the
implementation guidance on the 4D Operational Concept
was approved.
Additionally, after North Korea went ahead with its
nuclear test in January 2016, the Terminal High Altitude
Area Defense (THAAD)[26] was temporarily deployed by
the U.S. Forces Korea in September 2017. In addition,
in a U.S.-ROK summit meeting also held in September,
the enhanced deployment of U.S. strategic assets in and
around the ROK on a rotational basis was agreed.
In light of progress in dialogue with North Korea, the
U.S. and the ROK have made several announcements
regarding the “conclusion” of U.S.-ROK joint military
exercises, including Freedom Guardian, Vigilante Ace,
and the Key Resolve and Foal Eagle exercises since 2018.
Furthermore, in March 2019, the two countries conducted
Alliance (Dong Maeng), a combined command exercise,
and also carried out another combined command exercise
in August 2019 without clearly disclosing its size, exercise
name, and other details. That November, the United
States and the ROK announced the postponement of a
U.S.-ROK combined air training, as an act of goodwill
to contribute to an environment conducive to diplomacy
and the advancement of peace. In February 2020, they
announced the postponement of U.S.-ROK joint training
to curb the spread of the novel coronavirus outbreak.
The combined training in August is said to have been
conducted on a reduced scale.
Moreover, at the new year press conference in January

Notes: According to the website of the Ministry of National Defense of ROK (accessed in December 2020)


-----

2021, President Moon Jae-in mentioned in relation to
U.S.-ROK joint military training that North Korea would
react sensitively to every exercise, and that it would be
possible to have a discussion with North Korea through
the Inter-Korean Joint Military Committee. Meanwhile,
the ROK carried out U.S.-ROK combined command
post training in March 2021. Also, the ROK carried out a
U.S.-ROK joint air training in April that year.
At the same time, the two countries have worked to
deal with such issues as the transition of operational
control (OPCON) to the ROK[27] and the realignment of
U.S. Forces Korea.
For the transition of OPCON to the ROK, the roadmap
for the transfer “Strategic Alliance 2015” was established
in October 2010. Aiming to complete the transition by
December 1, 2015, the two countries have reviewed the
approach of transitioning from the existing combined
defense arrangement of the U.S. and ROK Forces, to a
new joint defense arrangement led by the ROK Forces
and supported by the U.S. Forces.
Nevertheless, based on the increasing seriousness of
North Korea’s nuclear and missile threats, the two sides
decided at the 46th SCM to re-postpone the transition
of OPCON, and to adopt a conditions-based approach,
i.e., implementing the transition when conditions such as
the ROK Forces’ enhanced capabilities are met. At the
50th SCM in October 2018, it was decided that following
the transition of OPCON, an ROK military officer will
serve as commander of the Future Combined Forces
Command, replacing the current arrangement of a U.S.
military officer serving as the commander of the U.S.ROK Combined Forces.
In the SCM, a decision was also made on the plan to
conduct an Initial Operating Capability (IOC) assessment
regarding the ROK Forces’ operational capabilities in
2019. In August of the same year, an IOC assessment was
conducted during combined command post exercises.
At the 51st SCM in November 2019, the two parties
concurred that the exercise had played an important role
in verifying IOC and decided to pursue an assessment
of Full Operational Capability for the Future Combined
Forces Command in 2020. However, due to the impact of
the COVID-19 pandemic and other reasons, only rehearsal
exercises were conducted in 2020 and March 2021.
The ROK Forces plan to enhance and expand early
the military capabilities leading the U.S.-ROK Alliance
and defense capabilities needed to address North Korean
nuclear and missile threat, which are required for the
transition of OPCON, and accelerate the transition of
OPCON through periodic evaluations of readiness.


With regard to the realignment of the U.S. Forces
Korea, an agreement had been reached in 2003 on
the relocation of the U.S. Forces’ Yongsan Garrison
located in the center of Seoul to the Pyeontaek area,
south of Seoul, and on the relocation of the U.S. Forces
stationed north of the Han River to the south of the river.
Subsequently, however, the agreement has been partially
revised, due to various factors, including: in relation to
the postponement of the transition of OPCON, it has been
necessary for some U.S. Forces personnel to remain at
Yongsan Garrison; and it was decided that the counterfires forces of U.S. Forces Korea would remain in their
location north of the Han River to counter the threat of
North Korea’s long-range rocket artillery.
In July 2017 the U.S. Eighth Army headquarters
relocated to the Pyeontaek area, and in June 2018 the
headquarters of U.S. Forces Korea and UN Command also
relocated to the same area. The realignment of U.S. Forces
Korea could have a significant impact on U.S. and ROK
defense postures on the Korean Peninsula, and as such it
will be necessary to follow future developments closely.
Concerning defense burden sharing, whereby the ROK
government bears a portion of the total stationing costs
of the U.S. Forces Korea to ensure a stable stationing
environment, in March 2021, the United States and the
ROK reached an agreement on the 11th Special Measures
Agreement (SMA). This agreement is valid for six years
from 2020 to 2025. Total amount for FY2020 remains
unchanged at the FY2019 level and 13.9% increase
for FY 2021, compared to FY2020, while for FY2022FY2025 the rate of increase in the ROK defense spending
from the previous year will be applied.

**5 Relations with Other Countries**


**Chapter**


**(1) Relations with China**
China and the ROK have made continuous efforts to
strengthen their relations. Meanwhile, outstanding
issues have emerged between China and the ROK.
China has protested that the deployment of THAAD to
U.S. Forces Korea would undermine China’s strategic
security interests. On this point, in October 2017 the
governments of China and the ROK announced that
they had agreed to utilize military channels to reach
a mutual understanding relating to China’s concerns
about THAAD. In December 2017 President Moon Jaein made his first visit to China since his inauguration
and the two leaders agreed to establish a hotline and
continue to maintain close communication, as well as
vitalizing high-level strategic dialogue.


27 The United States and the ROK have had the U.S.-ROK Combined Forces Command since 1978 in order to operate the U.S.-ROK combined defense system to deter wars on the Korean Peninsula and
to perform effective combined operations in the case of a contingency. Under the U.S.-ROK combined defense system, OPCON over the ROK Forces is to be exercised by the Chairman of the Korea


-----

The 2020 Defense White Paper of the ROK also
makes clear that the ROK will strengthen strategic
communication with China.

**(2) Relations with Russia**
The ROK and Russia have agreed on cooperation in
the areas of military technology, defense industry, and
military supplies. In June 2018, President Moon Jae-in
visited Russia as a state guest, becoming the first ROK


president to do so in 19 years. In August 2018, defense
strategic dialogue was held, and it was agreed that the
dialogue will be upgraded to the vice minister level
and that a hotline will be established between the two
countries’ air forces. On the other hand, Russia opposes
the deployment of THAAD by U.S. Forces Korea for the
reason that it is part of the U.S. missile defense network
and harms the strategic stability of the region.

**2** **Security and Defense Policies**


**1 Strategic and Policy Documents**

Against the backdrop of foreign policy factors, including
the Ukrainian crisis and the military intervention in Syria,
Russia set out its objectives and strategic priorities of
domestic and foreign policies in the “National Security
Strategy” revised in December 2015.
The National Security Strategy construes that Russia
has an increasingly greater role in a multipolarizing
world. The Strategy perceives increased activity of
NATO and expansion of its member states as threats
to national security, and expresses its vigilance against
the U.S. deployment of missile defense (MD) systems
to Europe and the Asia-Pacific region for undermining
global and regional stability.
In the defense domain, the Strategy commits to
giving continued priority to the role fulfilled by Russia’s
military force, and to ensuring strategic deterrence and
preventing military conflict by maintaining a sufficient
level of nuclear deterrent capability and combat readiness
of Russian military forces, including the Armed Forces of
the Russian Federation (AFRF).
The Military Doctrine, revised in December 2014 as
a document substantiating the principles of the National
Security Strategy in the military sphere, states the
existing view that while the probability of an outbreak of
a large-scale war is decreasing, military risks to Russia
are increasing, such as the movement of NATO’s military
infrastructure closer to Russia’s borders including
the expansion of NATO, and the establishment and
deployment of strategic MD systems. In addition, the
doctrine expresses growing alarm, defining the following
as new military risks: NATO’s military buildup; the
realization of the U.S. Global Strike concept; rise of global
extremism (terrorism); formation of governments in
neighboring countries that carry out policies threatening
Russia’s interests; and the incitement of ethnic, social,
and religious confrontations in Russia.
The doctrine positions nuclear weapons as an essential
component for preventing the outbreak of nuclear wars
and military conflicts that use conventional weapons.
Regarding the criteria for its use, it states Russia reserves
the right to use nuclear weapons in retaliation not only for
the use of nuclear or other WMDs, but also in the event of
invasion using conventional weapons, where the survival
of the country itself is imperiled.
In June 2020, for the first time, Russia released a
policy document, “Basic Principles of State Policy of


**Chapter**


An executive order from the President of Russia that approves the
“Basic Principles of State Policy of the Russian Federation on Nuclear Deterrence”
(June 2, 2020) [Presidential Executive Office of Russia]

the Russian Federation on Nuclear Deterrence,” which is
equivalent to the so-called nuclear doctrine. Criteria for
the use of nuclear weapons are the same as the criteria
described in the military doctrine, but the document
clarifies the conditions for Russia to newly proceed to
the use of nuclear weapons. In the “Basic Principles,”
it is explained that, in addition to the “individual states

[…] that consider the Russian Federation as a potential
adversary,” even “military coalitions (blocs, alliances)”
in which these countries participate are also subject to
nuclear deterrence to clarify Russia’s “red lines.”


**2 Defense Budget**

With regard to Russia’s defense budget, the amounts
executed for FY2011-FY2016 showed year-on-year
double-digit growth and reached 4.4% of GDP. After
that, it has remained at a level of around 3% of GDP.[1]

control of the Military District Commander. In December
2014, the newly established position of the Northern
Joint Strategic Command was given to the Northern
Fleet belonging to the Western District to develop a jointoperations system in which the ground troops, the naval
vessels, and the air and air defense units facing the Arctic
are operated integrally. Based on this reorganization,
the “four military districts and five Joint Strategic
Command” system had been in operation. After January
2021, however, the Northern Fleet was designated as an
independent military administration division and given
a position equivalent to a military district, which made
the previous system become the “five military districts
and five Joint Strategic Command” system. This change
resulted in the establishment of a system in which the two
aspects of military command and military administration
are in agreement for the entire AFRF.
Regarding the modernization of the military forces,
Russia has been aiming to increase its percentage
of new equipment to 70% by 2020. As of the end of
2020, the percentage is believed to have reached 70%
in conventional weapons, and 86% in the nuclear triad
(ICBM, SLBM, and strategic bombers), indicating that
the goal was achieved.
Regarding the professionalization of the military forces,
in order to make the combat readiness of the permanent
readiness units effective, Russia promotes the introduction
of a contract service system which selects personnel who
would serve under contracts from the conscripted military
personnel. In 2015, the number of contract servicemen
exceeded the number of conscripted personnel for the first
time, and in 2020 reportedly the former nearly doubled
the latter. On the other hand, with the procurement of
new equipment, the shortage of contract servicemen with
expert knowledge has been suggested.

conventional forces. Russia is thus making efforts to

**3** **Military Posture and Trends**

maintain readiness.
Russia possesses ICBMs, SLBMs, and long-range
bombers comparable to the United States in scale.
In 2011, Russia started the deployment of “Yars”
ICBM, which is considered a multi-warhead version
of the “Topol-M” ICBM. It is currently developing the
“Sarmat” heavy ICBM, which is believed to be capable of
carrying a warhead with the capability to breach missile
defense systems. Four Borey-class SSBN vessels, which
carry the new-type SLBM “Bulava,” were commissioned.
There are plans to deploy four such vessels each to the
Northern Fleet and Pacific Fleet in the future. Russia also
continues to carry out the modernization renovation of a

**3 Military Reform**

Russia has implemented full-scale military reform
since 1997 by presenting the three pillars of reform:
downsizing; modernization; and professionalization.
Regarding the downsizing of the military forces, it
was decided that AFRF would have a strength of one
million personnel as of 2016. Since December 2010,
Russia reorganized its six military districts into four
military districts (Western, Southern, Central and Eastern
Districts). On this basis, Russia established a joint strategic
command in each military district and is carrying out
integrated operations of its entire military forces, such as
Land Forces, Navy, and Aerospace Forces units under the


Russia’s military forces are comprised of forces such
as the AFRF, the Border Guard Service of the Federal
Security Service of the Russian Federation (FSB), and
the Federal National Guard Service of the Russian
Federation. The AFRF consists of three services and
two independent forces: Land Forces; Navy; Aerospace
Forces; Strategic Missile Forces; and Airborne Forces.

the air-launched cruise missile “Kh-101,” and the airlaunched ballistic missile “Kinzhal.” Concerning the
“Kalibr” SLCM system, in particular, Russia has been
promoting the deployment of frigates and submarines
capable of carrying this missile system in the Far East.
Since this may bring a significant impact on the security
environment surrounding Japan, close attention must be
paid to any development of the situation.

**2 New Types of Weapons**


Since 1999, the membership of Eastern European
countries to NATO, so-called “NATO’s Eastward
Expansion,” has been promoted. At the same time, Russia
is increasing alertness to the moves by the United States
that has been advancing missile defense (MD) systems
domestically and overseas.
Amid such a situation, President Putin at the annual
presidential address to the Federal Assembly of Russia in
March 2018 expressed the view that the MD systems both
in and outside of the United States are being deployed
as a measure in response to ballistic missiles, which are
the foundation of Russian nuclear forces, and introduced
the following five new types of weapons as a means to
breach the MD systems.

-  ICBM “Sarmat,” which is believed to be capable of
attacking targets via the North Pole or the South Pole
with no substantial range limitation

-  Hypersonic glide vehicle (HGV) “Avangard,” which is
claimed to be capable of flying at speeds greater than
Mach 20 in the intercontinental atmosphere

-  Air-launched ballistic missile (ALBM) “Kinzhal,”
which can be attached to MiG-31K fighters

-  Nuclear cruise missile “Burevestnik,” which is capable
of flying at lower altitudes with no substantial range
limitation

Tu-95 and Tu-160 long-range bombers.
With respect to non-strategic nuclear forces, the
Intermediate-Range Nuclear Forces (INF) Treaty
signed by the United States and the Soviet Union ended
in August 2019. Russia has repeatedly expressed its
stance of not manufacturing and not deploying shortand intermediate-range missiles targeting Europe and
other regions, unless the United States deploys groundlaunched short- and intermediate-range missiles. On
the other hand, Russia is working to deploy missiles
with various launch platforms such as the groundlaunched missile system “Iskander,” which is believed
to be capable of carrying either conventional or nuclear
warheads, the sea-launched cruise missile system “Kalibr,”

In 2019, Russia also announced for the first time
that the sea-launched hypersonic cruise missile (HCM)
“Zircon,” which has a believed range of over 1,000km with
the maximum speed of Mach 9, was under development.
Of these new types of weapons, HGV “Avangard”
and ALBM “Kinzhal” are already deployed, while the
mass production of ICBM “Sarmat” is believed start in
2022. In October 2020, the Russian Ministry of Defence


announced a successful launch test of HCM “Zircon,”
and President Putin, in December of the same year,
mentioned that the development of “Zircon” had been
nearly completed.

**3 Conventional Forces and Other Issues**


Russia is developing and procuring equipment in
accordance with the State Armaments Program (GPV:
Gosudarstvennaya Programma Vooruzheniya). It is also
moving ahead with the development, procurement, and
deployment of new equipment, such as the “Su-57”
currently under development as the so-called “fifth
generation fighter” and the T-14 Armata tank, in addition
to the introduction of the Su-35 fighter and the surfaceto-surface missile system “Iskander.” Russia has also
announced that its Aerospace Forces focus on the
integration with manned aircraft in the development
of unmanned aerial vehicles. Regarding this matter,
in September 2019, the Ministry of Defence of Russia
disclosed images of a cooperative flight test of heavy
unmanned combat aerial vehicle “Okhotnik” and the 5th
generation fighter Su-57. In December 2020, another
cooperative flight of a Tu-95 long-range bomber and
unmanned aerial vehicle was also reported.
The Russian Navy currently has one conventional
powered aircraft carrier, but reportedly plans to acquire
a nuclear-powered aircraft carrier by the end of 2030.
Furthermore, in July 2020, Russia undertook the
construction of two of its first amphibious assault ships,
which are expected to be delivered to the Russian Navy
by 2027. In the past, Russia ordered from France two
Mistral-class amphibious assault ships in 2011, but the
contract for that order was cancelled amid the intensifying
conflict between Russia and the West following the
Ukraine crisis in 2014.

**4 Space and Electromagnetic Domain**


The AFRF has also been stepping up its activities in the
realms of space and electromagnetic spectrum in recent
years. Russia has been promoting the development of
anti-satellite weapons, such as the “Nudol” anti-satellite
missile system, for which multiple launch tests are said
to have been conducted. Since 2013, Russia has put
satellites into both low and geostationary orbits to conduct
rendezvous and proximity operations (RPO), which have
repeatedly been observed engaging in frequent RPO with
other countries’ satellites on geostationary orbits. In July
2020, United States Space Command (USSPACECOM)
announced that there was proof that Russia had conducted
a test of a space-based anti-satellite weapon in Earth orbit.
Commander General John Raymond at USSPACECOM
criticized in his statement that, “This is further evidence
of Russia’s continuing efforts to develop and test spacebased systems.”
In the electromagnetic domain, since 2009, the AFRF
have established an Electronic Warfare (EW) Unit,
and many new EW systems have been procured and
distributed or allocated to each service and force. Russia
is suspected of stepping up activities using weapons of
electronic warfare, with accusations that AFRF based
on the Kola Peninsula in the Arctic Circle jammed GPS
signals while the major NATO military exercise Trident
Juncture was taking place in 2018.

**5 Trends Related to the AFRF (General)**

airfields and deploying Tu-22 medium-range bombers
and Mig-31 interceptor fighters, while also deploying
surface-to-air missiles and surface-to-ship missiles to
develop sufficient preparedness for dealing with airborne
threats from the north and attacks from ships. Along
with these developments, Russia has built a large-scale
residential facility for personnel at the base in two places
within the Arctic Region.
In addition to the development of such military
facilities, the AFRF has also been conducting such
activities as strategic nuclear deterrence patrols by SSBN
and patrol flights by long-range bombers. For example,
Tu-95 and Tu-160 long-range bombers have frequently
been observed flying through international airspace
off the Alaskan coast and over the Barents Sea and
Norwegian Sea.
Against the background of such activities in the Arctic
Region, this region had been attracting attention from
Russia and many other countries due to increased mining
potential of reserve resources and enhanced usefulness
as a sea route identified with sea ice melting caused by
global warming in recent years. For this reason, Russia
has been promoting the system to defend the national
interest in the Arctic Region, and clearly stating in various
policy documents Russia’s rights in the Arctic Region
and the roles of the AFRF in defending the national
interest. For example, in the Strategy for Developing
the Russian Arctic Zone and Ensuring National Security
until 2035, revised in October 2020, Russia clearly states
“ensuring operational system adequate for the Arctic
Circle,” “developing modern weapons, and military and
special equipment suitable for the Arctic environment,”
and “developing base infrastructure” as specific issues to
be addressed in order to ensure the military security in the
Arctic Region.


**Chapter**


Since 2010, the AFRF has been conducting large-scale
round-robin exercises in each military district, with the
objective of verifying the combat readiness of the military
districts, etc.[2] These exercises are helping to improve the
long-distance mobilization capability of the AFRF. In
2020, Maneuvers “Kavkaz 2020” was held in the Southern
Military District with approximately 80,000 military
personnel and about 1,000 soldiers from six countries,
including China and Iran, participated in the exercises. In
recent years, the scale of these exercises, along with the
overseas participants, tends to be expanding.
In December 2020, Russia conducted large-scale
strategic nuclear-force exercises that involved launching
of several ICBM and SLBM. In the exercises, a new-type
SLBM was launched for the first time from a Borey-class
SSBN in the Sea of Okhotsk.
In the Arctic Region, Russia is developing coastal
surveillance radar networks for enhanced vigilance and
surveillance. At the same time, Russia is rebuilding


The exercises were conducted primarily in the Central, Western, Eastern, and Southern Military Districts, and are called “Tsentr (Central),” “Zapad (West),” “Vostok (East),” “Kavkaz


-----

Russia thus appears to be stepping up military activities,
so close scrutiny of developments in this regard will
be required.
With regard to the development of AFRF pertaining
to the COVID-19 infection, when the infection was
spreading, in February 2020 the Russian Ministry of
Defence sent two Aerospace Force’s transport aircraft
carrying CBRN (Chemical, Biological, Radiological,
and Nuclear) experts, military physicians, and virologists
to Wuhan, China, and transported hundreds of people
in addition to Russian citizens to Russia. The AFRF
mobilized more than 30,000 personnel for conducting
infectious disease countermeasures, in which the CBRN
Protection Force carried out disinfection work for
military facilities and other city blocks, and accepted
infected people at military hospitals. Efforts have been
made to increase the number of hospital beds with the
aim of also offering medical support to the private sector,
such as increasing the number of beds of the hospital
ship held by the Pacific Fleet and newly constructing
16 medical centers nationwide. Russia has also carried
out support activities such as transportation of medical
relief goods for other countries. Furthermore, the 48th
Central Scientific Research Institute of the Ministry of
Defence worked with the Gamaleya National Center of
Epidemiology and Microbiology under the Ministry of
Health and jointly developed Russia’s own “Sputnik V”
COVID-19 vaccine.
Meanwhile, Russia’s annual military parade on the
Victory Day in May was postponed to June due to the
COVID-19 outbreak. However, other than the parade,
exercises and training of the AFRF seem to have been
conducted as normal, and active military activities
have been confirmed, including launching tests of antisatellite missiles and responses to U.S. aircraft above the
Mediterranean Sea and the Alaska Region.

related to deployment of new units and military facility
development. In recent years, Russia has also been
deploying the latest equipment in the Far East.
Given that the AFRF set their basis of operation on
maintaining the combat readiness of their strategic nuclear
units and dealing with conflicts through the intertheater
mobility of its round-the-clock readiness units, it is
necessary to keep our attention on the positioning and
trends of the AFRF in the Far East region while also
keeping in mind the trends of units in other regions.

**(1) Nuclear Forces**
As for strategic nuclear forces in the Far East region,
one Delta III-class SSBN and two Borey-class SSBNs
equipped with SLBMs are deployed in and around the
Sea of Okhotsk, and approximately 30 Tu-95 long-range
bombers are deployed in Ukrainka. Russia is prioritizing
the reinforcement of its maritime strategic deterrence
posture which had been greatly scaled-down compared
to the former Soviet Union, and as part of these efforts, it
plans on deploying four Borey-class SSBNs to the Pacific
Fleet by 2020.


**Chapter**


**(2) Ground Forces**
The Eastern Military District now consists of ten
brigades and two divisions with approximately 80,000
personnel in total as well as a marine brigade equipped
with amphibious operations capability. The Eastern
Military District has introduced new equipment, such as
the “Iskander” surface-to-surface missile system, “Bal”
and “Bastion” surface-to-ship missiles, and the “S-400”
surface-to-air missile system.

**(3) Naval Forces**
The Pacific Fleet is stationed or deployed at its main
bases in Vladivostok and Petropavlovsk-Kamchatskiy.
The fleet is comprised of approximately 260 ships with
a total displacement in the region of approximately
610,000 tons, including approximately 20 major surface
ships and approximately 20 submarines (approximately
13 of which are nuclear powered submarines) with a total
displacement of approximately 220,000 tons. In December
2020, the “Gremyashchiy”—an improved version of the
Steregushchiy-class frigate carrying “Kalibr” cruise
missiles—which was newly built for the Pacific Fleet
was commissioned. In April 2021, the Udaloy-class
modernized frigate “Marshal Shaposhnikov” conducted a
test launch of “Kalibr” cruise missiles in the Sea of Japan
for the first time, and returned to part of the permanent
readiness forces as the first vessel in the Pacific Fleet
armed with “Kalibr” cruise missiles.


Russia newly established the Eastern Military District
and the Eastern Joint Strategic Command in 2010.
Land Forces, the Pacific Fleet, and the Air Force and
Air Defense Units have been placed under the Military
District Commander, who conducts unified operation of
these services.
The current presence of the AFRF in the Far East
region is significantly smaller than it was at its peak.
However, a considerable scale of military forces,
including nuclear forces, still remains in the region.
Russian armed forces in the vicinity of Japan are
generally increasing activity, including the trend


-----

28 naval vessels including a Slava-class guided missile
cruiser passed through the Soya Strait. This was the
largest number of vessels announced by the Ministry of
Defense (MOD) as having transited this strait at the same
time since the end of the Cold War.
Regarding aircraft, since the resumption of the patrol
activities by its strategic aviation units in 2007, Russia
has been increasing flights by long range bombers. Also,
there were flights of Tu-95 bombers refueled in midflight and supported by A-50 early warning and control
aircraft and Su-27 fighters as well as flights of Tu-160.
While the number of scrambles against Russian aircraft
fell from the previous year, Russian aircraft continued
to be active in 2020, with one incursion into Japanese
airspace, involving SDF aircraft scrambled against the
Russian aircraft, confirmed to have occurred. Following
the joint air patrol in July 2019, it was confirmed that,
in December 2020, two Russian Tu-95 bombers carried
out a long-distance joint flight with Chinese H-6 bombers

**(4) Air Forces**
In the Eastern Military District, Russia deploys
approximately 320 combat aircraft from its Aerospace
Forces and Navy combined. Existing models are being
modernized and new models, such as the Su-35 fighters
and the Su-34 fighter-bombers, are being introduced to
improve their capabilities.

**(5) Operations in the Vicinity of Japan**
In the vicinity of Japan, the AFRF has been generally
increasing its activities, including exercises and drills
which are believed to be conducted for objectives such as
verifying the results of the military reform.
The number of exercises carried out by the Russian Land
Forces in the areas adjacent to Japan has decreased from
the peak. However, its activities are generally increasing.
With regard to naval vessels, their activities are
generally increasing in recent years. For example,
various exercises and long-distance voyages have been
carried out by Pacific Fleet vessels, along with patrols
by nuclear-powered submarines. In September 2018,


Since 1978 during the former Soviet Union era, Russia

**4** **Russian Forces in Japan’s Northern Territories**

has redeployed Land Forces units on Kunashiri, Etorofu,
and Shikotan Islands of the Northern Territories, which
are inherent territories of Japan. While the Russian troop
strength is thought to be far less than that at peak times,
one division is still stationed in Kunashiri and Etorofu
Islands. Furthermore, tanks, armored vehicles, various
types of artillery, and anti-air missiles are deployed.
Russia has been proceeding with the development of
military facilities in the Northern Territories in recent years
and tends to deploy the latest equipment. In November
2016 Russia announced that it deployed coastal (surface

to-ship) missiles to Etorofu and Kunashiri Islands. In
January 2018, the new civilian airport built in 2014 in
Etorofu Island in addition to Tennei military airfield was
opened up to joint military and civilian use, with three
Su-35 fighter aircraft reportedly deployed to the new
airport in August 2018.
The deployment of the latest type main battle tank

“T-72B3” as equipment of the Land Forces was confirmed
by 2018, while the latest medium-range unmanned
reconnaissance vehicle “Orlan-10” has been observed
since 2015 being used in the exercises of Land Forces
units Furthermore in December 2020 media related to

the Russian Ministry of Defence reported the deployment
of “S-300V4” surface-to-air missile (maximum firing
range of 400 km) in Etorofu and Kunashiri Islands.
Russia also continues to carry out military exercises on
the Northern Territories, and anti-landing exercises were
conducted in Etorofu and Kunashiri Islands in September
2020 and February 2021, respectively. A total of 1,0001,500 military personnel and approximately 200-300
equipment and machines from the Eastern Military
District participated in these exercises.
As described above, Russia continues to station AFRF
in the Northern Territories, which are inherent territories
of Japan, and has recently been increasing the AFRF’s
activities in the territories under de facto occupation.
Some point out that such developments reflect the
Russian people’s heightened awareness of territorial
integrity due to the Ukrainian crisis, as well as the rising
military importance of the Northern Territories adjacent
to the Sea of Okhotsk, an operating area of SSBN.
Closer attention must be paid to Russian military
movements in the Far East, including the Northern Territories.

in open, rational, and pragmatic diplomacy to protect
its national interests. It aims to pursue multidirectional
diplomacy by ruling out futile confrontation and acquiring

Russia would balance its posture of economic-centered
and benefit-focused foreign policy with Russia’s politics
and diplomacy including security in order to develop its
relations with other countries.

**2 Relations with the United States**


November 2020, the United States pulled out of the Open
Skies Treaty, which was signed by the Western countries
and Russia allowing its participants to mutually conduct
unarmed observation and surveillance flights, and this
was followed by Russia announcing its withdrawal in
January 2021.
With regard to the New START Treaty (Strategic Arms
Reduction Treaty), which set the upper limit of strategic
nuclear forces between Russia and the United States,
President Putin and newly inaugurated President Biden
of the United States agreed on its unconditional extension
for five years during their first telephone talk in January
2021, just before the expiration of the treaty in February
of the same year.

**3 Relations with China**


President Putin has striven to deepen cooperative
relations with the United States in the economic domain,
while opposing the United States on any action Russia
considers as “a U.S. attempt to encroach on Russia’s
strategic interests.”
On the military front, feeling that the United States’
installation of missile defense systems both at home
and abroad — including in Europe and the Asia-Pacific
— undermines global and regional security, Russia has
criticized these moves for upsetting the strategic balance.
Russia is also moving forward with the development
of new strategic weapons that are said to be capable of
reliably penetrating missile defense systems.
However, since the United States suspended military
exchanges with Russia in March 2014 over the Ukrainian
crisis, there have been frequent instances of both
countries’ aircraft and ships coming into close proximity
with each other. In November 2020, U.S. Navy’s guidedmissile destroyer transited in the vicinity of Peter the
Great Bay off the coast of Vladivostok, Russian Far East,
against which the Russian Ministry of Foreign Affairs in
a statement criticized the U.S. vessel’s intrusion into the
Russian territorial waters as “public provocation.” Since
the time of the Soviet Union, Russia has been claiming
this Bay as its internal waters under international law,
while the United States refutes that the water the U.S.
vessel navigated is not the Russian territorial water.
The United States is also demonstrating increasingly
vigilance over Russian activities in space. In February
2020, United States Space Command (USSPACECOM)
commander Gen. John Raymond described recent
Russian satellite behavior as “unusual and disturbing”
and criticized Russia for activities that “do not reflect
the behavior of a responsible spacefaring nation.”
In addition, in April 2019, he announced that Russia
had conducted an anti-satellite weapons test, noting
that this was “further proof of Russia’s hypocritical
advocacy of outer space arms control proposals
designed to restrict the capabilities of the United
States while clearly having no intention of halting its
own counterspace weapons programs.”
Between the United States and Russia, the IntermediateRange Nuclear Forces (INF) Treaty ended in August
2019 during the former Trump administration after
having gone through a series of processes originating
from the withdrawal announcement of the U S side In


**Chapter**


Russia continues to advance close military cooperation
with China. Export agreements on new armaments such as
the S-400 surface-to-air missile system and Su-35 fighter
jets were concluded in 2015, and since 2012, Russia and
China have been conducting joint naval exercise “Joint
Sea.” Russian Tu-95 bombers and Chinese H-6 bombers
have jointly carried out the “China-Russia joint air
patrol,” which involved flying from the Sea of Japan to
the East China Sea. Most recently, the joint air patrol was
conducted over the Sea of Japan and the East China Sea
in July 2019, and from the Sea of Japan through the East
China Sea to the Pacific Ocean in December 2020.
A package of documents on military and militarytechnical cooperation were signed at a meeting of the
China-Russia Intergovernmental Joint Commission
on Military-Technical Cooperation held in Moscow
September 2019, which was attended by Russian
Minister of Defence Shoigu and Vice Chairman of the
Chinese Central Military Commission Zhang. At the
China-Russia summit meeting that preceded this meeting
in June, the leaders of both countries issued the Joint
Statement on Developing Comprehensive Partnership and
Strategic Interaction Entering a New Era. Regarding this
statement, authorities of both countries both clearly denied
that they had formed a military alliance. However, in a
meeting held in October 2020, President Putin remarked
in responding to the question regarding the ChineseRussian military alliance, “Theoretically, it is possible
to envisage the military alliance but our cooperation and
mutual trust have reached the level where such alliance is
not necessary. […] However, we don’t intend to eliminate
the possibility either.” Therefore, the development of
the military cooperation between these two countries is
attracting attention.
In December 2020, Chinese and Russian Defense
Ministers had a video teleconference and agreed to

South Ossetia in 2015, and other efforts, Russia has been
working to ensure its military influence.
However, it is suggested that there have been some
signs of decreasing Russian influence on the former
Soviet bloc, which emerged in some situations and events
in 2020 such as the political instability in Belarus and
Kyrgyzstan, intensifying conflict in Nagorno-Karabakh,
and the birth of anti-Russian government in Moldova.
Particularly, in the Nagorno-Karabakh conflict, one of
the parties involved, Armenia, is a member state of CIS’s
Collective Security Treaty Organization (CSTO).[4] Thus,
Armenia and Russia have formed a military alliance,
but Russia’s involvement in this conflict was limited
to acting as a broker to lead ceasefire agreements and
dispatching peacekeeping units for the reason that the
battle relating to the conflict had not directly reached
the Armenian territory. In addition, Maia Sandu, who
won Moldova’s presidential election in December 2019


Russia positions the development of bilateral and
multilateral cooperation with the Commonwealth of
Independent States (CIS) as one of its most important

In the early morning hours of September
27, 2020, military clashes broke out at
several points along the border between
Azerbaijan and the Armenian-majority
region of Nagorno-Karabakh in the
Caucasus (see table below). Over the next
44 days, the conflict between Azerbaijan
and Armenia evolved into a conflict

**(2) Relations with European Countries**
Through the framework of the NATO-Russia Council
(NRC), Russia has worked with NATO as an equal partner
in the areas of common interest, such as by participating in
certain decision-making processes. However, following
the Ukrainian crisis in 2014, NATO and European
countries suspended their practical cooperation with
Russia, including that in the military domain, except for
the NRC’s ambassador-level meetings.
In May 2020, U.S. and U.K. Naval ships entered
the Barents Sea, which is adjacent to Russian Northern
Fleet’s nuclear powered submarine base. The Northern
Fleet sent a guided missile cruiser to track those ships.
It was reported to be the first time since the end of the
Cold War that NATO ships entered the Barents Sea.
In November 2020, President Putin at a meeting with
senior Ministry of Defence officials and defence industry
executives mentioned that NATO’s military presence near
the Russian boarder had been expanding, and criticized
the increase in military activities by NATO members
during the COVID-19 pandemic.

**(3) Relations with Middle Eastern and African Countries**
Since September 2015, while acquiring Tartus Naval

in Syria, the Russian military, which was carrying out
military operations to support the Assad administration
in Syria, has conducted aerial bombing using fighterbombers and long-range bombers as well as cruise
missiles from surface vessels and submarines deployed to
the Caspian Sea and Mediterranean. In December 2016,
a nationwide ceasefire agreement brokered by Russia and
Turkey took effect between the Assad administration and
opposition forces. While Russia has continued to fight
Syrian opposition forces since January 2017, it has been
increasing its presence in the Middle East by promoting
initiatives that aim for political resolutions in the future.
Russia continues to maintain a presence in Syria,
with the Russian Ministry of Defence announcing in
November 2019 that it had deployed helicopter units at
Qamishli airport in northeastern Syria, as well as at its
Khmeimim Air Base.
Additionally, operations in Syria using cruise missiles
and strategic bombers have provided the ideal setting
to demonstrate Russia’s long-range precision strike
capabilities. Considering the significant influence of

Transnistria region in the eastern part of the country

the “declaration of independence” from Moldova in
1990), and this may affect the stationing of the AFRF in
the region going forward.
Following Russia’s “annexation” of Crimea, sporadic
clashes between Ukrainian troops and separatist armed
forces have continued in eastern Ukraine, with over
10,000 people reported to have died since April 2014.
Progress in respect of most of the provisions in the Minsk
Protocol[5] signed by the OSCE, Russia, and Ukraine with
a view to peace has remained elusive.

**5 Relations with Other Countries**


**Chapter**


**(1) Relations with Asian Countries**
Russia recognizes that the significance of the AsiaPacific region is increasing within its multi-pronged
foreign policy, and considers it strategically important to
strengthen its status in the region from the viewpoint of
socioeconomic development in Siberia and the Far East,
and security. To achieve strategic stability and equal
strategic partnerships, Russia places particular emphasis
on developing a comprehensive partnership relationship
and strategic cooperative relationship with China as a key
factor in maintaining global and regional stability, and
also intends to assign an important role for the privileged
strategic partnership with India. Another example of
the ongoing wide-ranging military cooperation between
Russia and India is the joint exercise “INDRA,” which
has been taking place since 2003 with the involvement
of the armies and navies of both countries, with their air
forces also taking part in recent years.
It is a recent trend that foreign military forces
participate in Russia’s large-scale military exercises,
namely, with participation from China and Mongolia in
2018, India and Pakistan in 2019, and Myanmar for the
first time in 2020.
Regarding the relationship with Japan, Russia states
that it will develop mutually beneficial cooperation and
is intensifying its approach in many fields including
politics, economy and security.


The Minsk Protocol of September 2014 consists of the following items: (1) ensure the immediate bilateral cessation of the use of weapons; (2) ensure monitoring and verification by the Organization
for Security and Co-operation in Europe (OSCE) of the regime of non-use of weapons; (3) enact the Law of Ukraine “With respect to the temporary status of local self- government in certain areas of
the Donetsk and the Luhansk regions” (Law on Special Status); (4) ensure monitoring on the Ukrainian-Russian state border and verification by the OSCE, together with the creation of a security area
in the border regions of Ukraine and the Russian Federation; (5) immediately release all hostages and unlawfully detained persons; (6) prohibit the prosecution and punishment of persons in connection
with the events that took place in certain areas of Donetsk and Luhansk regions; (7) conduct an inclusive national dialogue; (8) adopt measures aimed at improving the humanitarian situation in
Donbas; (9) ensure the holding of early local elections in Donetsk and Luhansk regions; (10) remove unlawful military formations, military hardware, as well as militants and mercenaries from the
territory of Ukraine; (11) adopt a program for the economic revival of Donbass and the recovery of economic activity in the region; and (12) provide personal security guarantees for the participants

In October 2019, Russia held the first Russia-Africa
Summit in Sochi and also dispatched two Tu-160 strategic
bombers to South Africa under a military cooperation
agreement that it had signed with South Africa in 1995.
In December 2020, the Russian government announced
an agreement with the government of Sudan to set up a
naval base on the Red Sea in Sudan, northeastern Africa.
According to the published agreement documents, the
land lease period for the naval base is 25 years, Sudanese
airspace can be used, and weapons, ammunition and
equipment necessary to conduct missions on ships can be
carried in through the port in Sudan. Securing naval bases
in Sudan, in addition to Tartus in Syria, will enhance the
AFRF’s deployment capabilities further afield.

**6 Arms Exports**


In May 2020, AFRICOM announced that over 14 military aircraft with their insignia removed were
delivered from Russia to Al Jufra Air Base in Libya [U.S. Africa Command]

Russia’s military intervention on the course of the Assad
administration, coupled with the expanding partnerships
between Russia and surrounding countries such as Turkey
and Iran, Russia’s influence on future stability in Syria
and on the political settlement process cannot be ignored.
While supporting opposing sides in the Syrian conflict,
Russia and Turkey coordinate their interests to avoid
direct confrontation. In January 2020, the foreign and
defense ministers of the two countries held a meeting
in Moscow to discuss the Libyan situation. During this
meeting, representatives of the Libyan Government of
National Accord (GNA) led by Prime Minister Fayez
al-Sarraj and its opposition, the Libyan National Army
(LNA), attended peace talks. Russia is thus increasing
its influence over both the Syrian situation and peace in
Libya, while at the same time coordinating its interests
with Turkey. Furthermore, in May 2020, the United States
Africa Command (AFRICOM) announced that Russian
MiG-29 fighters were delivered to Libya after military
aircraft insignia had been removed in Syria, and accused
of Russia’s involvement in creating the war situation
in Libya using private military companies (PMC) that
the Russian government supports. AFRICOM also
mentioned the possibility of extremely serious security
concern arising in southern European countries, if Russia
establishes a base on the coast of Libya and develops
permanent A2/AD capabilities in the area. It has also
been reported that approximately 1,200 mercenaries from


**Chapter**


Russia actively promotes the export of arms not only to
maintain the infrastructure of its military industry and to
make economic profit, but also to help promote better
foreign policy. Export control is exclusively conducted
by the Rosoboronexport State Corporation. In addition,
Russia is working to improve the efficiency of its
production system by promoting the integration of aircraft
companies such as Sukhoi, MiG, and Tupolev. Currently,
Russia has the second largest share of arms exports in the
world after the United States,[6] exporting fighters, vessels
and surface-to-air missiles to countries including Asia,
Africa, and Middle East. In recent years, Russia has been
aggressively marketing its arms to allies and partners of
the United States, including Turkey and Saudi Arabia, in
addition to traditional export destinations. In particular,
the export of S-400 to Turkey, a member country of
NATO, has met with strong opposition from the United
States. Russia is also expanding its sales activities to
Southeast Asian countries such as Indonesia, Vietnam,
Malaysia, and Myanmar.

announced in November 2011, the U.S. Marines began

and have gradually expanded the scale since, which
resulted in approximately 2,500 Marines deployed in the
region in 2019.[3] It is also reported that U.S. Air Force
B-52 strategic bombers and F-22 fighters have been
deployed to Australia as needed to participate in training.
In addition, Australia is in the process of formulating
and implementing plans to enhance facilities, airfields,
and training grounds at bases used by the U.S. Forces,
including Darwin and Tindal.

**(2) Relations with China**
For Australia, China is the biggest trade partner, and
the two countries have conducted various exchanges in
the defense area such as dialogues between the defense
authorities, joint exercises, and mutual visiting of vessels,
in addition to exchanges and cooperation in the political
and economic areas.
Meanwhile, Australia has been showing its wariness
toward China by, among other ways, making Australia’s
position on China very clear.
The Australian Government expressed strong concerns
over China’s recent land reclamation and construction
activity in the South China Sea, and called on all claimant
states to halt militarization, while also clearly expressing
its intention to continue to exercise its rights to free
navigation and flight. Furthermore, the 2017 Foreign
Policy White Paper contained statements to the effect that
China is challenging the position of the United States in
the Indo-Pacific, the most important region for Australia.
People within and outside Australia expressed their
concerns over the acquisition by Chinese businesses of
Australian facilities, including Port Darwin, a port that
has been used by the Australian and United States fleets
among others. In January 2017, the federal Government
of Australia announced the establishment of the Critical
Infrastructure Centre to serve as a dedicated body that
will identify facilities requiring surveillance and carefully
manage the risks for advising related institutions in order
to block the sale of important infrastructure related to
national security, including specific ports and harbor
facilities, to companies from other countries. The Centre
manages the risks arising from foreign involvement by
assessing the risks of sabotage, espionage and coercion
in Australia’s critical infrastructure sectors, including
telecommunications, electricity, gas, water and ports.

**3 Relations with Other Countries**

In the 2020 Defence Strategic Update, the Australian
Government states that it will continue deepening
its alliance with the United States and strengthening
cooperation with other partners including Japan.

**(1) Relations with the United States**
The Australia-U.S. alliance was formalized through the
Security Treaty between Australia, New Zealand and the
United States of America (ANZUS).[2] In the 2020 Defence
Strategic Update, acknowledging that the alliance with
the United States, including intelligence sharing and
defense industrial and technological cooperation, is
critical, the Australian Government clearly states the
policy of continuing to deepen the alliance.
Since 1985, the two countries have been regularly
convening the Australia-United States Ministerial
Consultations (AUSMIN) to discuss major diplomatic
and security issues.
In the Joint Statement of the AUSMIN held in
Washington in July 2020, the two countries reaffirmed
that the Indo-Pacific would be “the focus of the Alliance,”
and that they will work side-by-side with ASEAN, India,
Japan, and other partners to maintain a region that is
secure, prosperous, inclusive, and rules-based. And the
two countries expressed “serious concerns” over coercive
and destabilizing actions across the Indo-Pacific. They
affirmed that China’s maritime claims are not valid
under international law in line with the 2016 decision
of the Arbitral Tribunal and emphasized that all claims
in the South China Sea must be made and resolved in
accordance with international law.
The military forces of the United States and
Australia are striving to improve interoperability
through bilateral exercises.
Exercise Talisman sabre is the Australian-U.S.
bilateral military exercise conducted biennially since
2005, with the objective of enhancing combat readiness
and interoperability. The 2019 exercise was the biggest
to date, with more than 34,000 personnel participating
from not only the United States and Australia, but also
Canada, New Zealand, and the United Kingdom, as well
as the SDF. It included amphibious operations and ground
combat training.
In 2020, the Australian and U.S. Navies carried out
joint exercises in the South China Sea.

**(4) Relations with Southeast Asia and Pacific Island**
**Countries**

In the 2020 Defence Strategic Update, Australia
announced the policy framework that the country’s
defense planning would focus on the region ranging from
the north-eastern Indian Ocean, through maritime and
mainland South East Asia to Papua New Guinea and the
South West Pacific.
Australia has been deepening its relations with
Indonesia in the security and defense fields following the
signing of the Lombok Treaty — a security cooperation
framework concerning cooperation in a wide range of
defense fields — in November 2006, the elevation of
their relationship to a strategic partnership in March
2010, and the September 2012 conclusion of the
Defence Cooperation Arrangement, which included the
enhancement of cooperation in the fields of anti-terrorism
measures and maritime security. The two countries’
cooperative relations in the security and defense fields
have stalled intermittently. However, since mutual visits
by ministers and higher-level officials resumed in the
second half of 2015, the bilateral relationship has been
improving through many initiatives, including regular
Foreign and Defense Ministerial Meetings (2+2) and
the signing of an agreement on maritime security and
terrorism, and of a Maritime Cooperation Plan of Action
in 2018.
With Singapore and Malaysia, Australia carries out
regular joint combined exercises in the South China
Sea and other areas under the Five Power Defence
Arrangements (FPDA; entered into force in 1971)
framework, whereby Australia, New Zealand, and the
United Kingdom would consult each other in the event
or threat of an armed attack on Singapore or Malaysia,
to decide on their response. Australia considers that
Singapore is its most advanced defense partner, and
that they share Australia’s interest in a secure maritime
trading environment. Defense cooperation is also
deepening, including the signing of a memorandum of
understanding concerning military training and training
area development in Australia under the comprehensive
strategic partnership in October 2016. Regarding
Malaysia, Australia stations the ADF in Royal Malaysian
Air Force (RMAF) Base Butterworth, and contributes
to maintaining regional security and stability through
patrol activities in the South China Sea and the northern
Indian Ocean.
Australia plays a leading role in assisting Pacific
Island countries and Timor-Leste in fields such as
security maintenance, coping with natural disasters, and
maritime patrol. In particular, in the field of maritime
patrol, Australia still regularly deploys ADF assets to
the South Pacific to assist with patrol activities It also

interference in domestic affairs by foreign actors. The
Australian Government announced that an Australian
company would receive government support and accept
an underwater telecommunication cable network project
that was to be partially conducted by the Chinese
telecommunication company Huawei. Moreover, in
August 2018, Huawei revealed that the company and
ZTE were banned from bidding in an Australian 5G
(advanced telecommunication system) network project
by the Australian Government.
With regard to the COVID-19 pandemic, the Australian
Government has raised the demand for an independent
investigation into the origin of how COVID-19 infections
had spread from China to the world to cause the pandemic.
With this as a starting point, China is said to be applying
pressure in Australia by placing restrictions on importing
Australian goods such as coal, meat, barley, and wine,
and also calling for cancelling travels to and study abroad
programs in Australia. In addition, it is suggested that
the recent large scale cyber attacks on the Australian
Government and critical infrastructure in the country
were conducted by China. There have also been incidents
that people related to Australian media were banned
from leaving the country, or detained or arrested by the
Chinese authority. It is also pointed out that the conflict
between China and Australia is worsening in relation to
the human rights issue in Hong Kong and Uighurs.

**(3) Relations with India**
Australia sees India as a key security partner.
At the Australia-India summit meeting (held online)
in June 2020, the two countries agreed to upgrade their
relationship to be a Comprehensive Strategic Partnership.
The two leaders announced that both countries share the
vision of “an open, free, rules-based Indo-Pacific region,”
and released the “Joint Declaration on a Shared Vision
for Maritime Cooperation in the Indo-Pacific.” At the
summit meeting, other than cooperation in the economic
field, in the area of national defense, Australia and India
concluded the military acquisition and cross-servicing
agreement between them, and agreed to strengthen the
interoperability of the forces through military exercises
based on the above agreement. In addition, the two
countries also signed an agreement to further promote
defense science technology cooperation.
In November 2020, the Royal Australian Navy
participated in the Multilateral Exercise “Malabar,” which
had been carried out by the U.S. Navy, Indian Navy, and
the Japan Maritime Self-Defense Force (JMSDF).

In November 2018, Australia announced its largest
ever financial package of up to AUS$3 billion for
infrastructure development in Pacific Island countries,
with the intent of further strengthening relations. In May
2019, immediately after forming his Cabinet following
the general election, Prime Minister Scott Morrison
expressed his intention to continue active engagement
with the Pacific Island countries, called “Pacific Stepup.” He made his first official trip overseas after the
cabinet forming to Solomon Islands in June 2019,
showing his stance of placing importance on the Pacific
Island countries.

**(5) Overseas Activities**
Since Australia finished part of the missions in the Middle
East, it has been moving to conduct activities focusing
on the Indo-Pacific as indicated in the 2020 Defence
Strategic Update.
Australian activities in Iraq, such as advising and
assisting, as well as providing capacity building assistance
to the Iraqi Security Forces on the military front, were


completed in June 2020.
Australia had been deploying one E-7A airborne early
warning and control aircraft and one KC-30A aerial
refueling aircraft to the Middle East to provide support
for anti-terrorism operations conducted by the United
States and other countries, but announced the completion
of these activities in September 2020.
In addition, Australia announced the plan to reduce
the Royal Australian Navy’s activities in the Middle East
for the reasons to prioritize the deployment of resources
in the Asia-Pacific region. Activities at the International
Maritime Security Construct (IMSC), which was
established under the U.S.-led Maritime Security
Initiative, were completed in December 2020.
Meanwhile, in addition to the ADF’s policy of focussing
on training and maritime surveillance in the Indian
Ocean, the South China Sea, and around Pacific Island
countries, since 2018, ADF has also made contributions
to the peace and stability of the international community
by conducting patrolling and monitoring activities using
ADF patrol aircraft and vessels against illegal maritime
activities, including illicit ship-to-ship transfers by North
Korean ships, which is prohibited under the UN Security
Council resolution.

**2** **New Zealand**

Moreover, the Statement was the first document that
mentioned the impact of climate change and the role of
the New Zealand Defence Force (NZDF) regarding this
issue, which reflects the new administration’s Pacific
Reset strategy, which makes a commitment to support
the Pacific Island countries that have been exposed to
disasters. As for the issues in the South China Sea, New
Zealand had refrained from referring to China by name
in order to maintain its neutral position in this matter.
However, in the Statement, the country made a comment
on China’s militarization in the South China Sea, stating,
“China’s more confident assertion of its interests has at
times raised tensions with neighboring states and with the
United States.”
As for diplomatic relations, New Zealand has
maintained close relationships with the United States
and Australia based on the ANZUS Treaty. In particular,
New Zealand sees Australia as its closest partner. The
United States has suspended its defense obligation to
New Zealand since 1985, when New Zealand refused the
entrance of a U.S. ship following New Zealand’s ban on
nuclear weapons. Nevertheless, the two countries have
strengthened their relationship in the diplomacy and


**Chapter**


In July 2018, New Zealand announced a defense policy, the
Strategic Defence Policy Statement 2018. This document
refers to major changes in the strategic environment since
the publication of the previous Defence White Paper in
2016, including intensifying competition among powers,
climate change, and cyber and space.
The Statement then presented New Zealand’s security
objectives, specifically, ensuring public safety, preserving
sovereignty and territorial integrity, protecting lines of
communication, etc., strengthening international order,
sustaining economic prosperity, maintaining democratic
institutions and national values, and protecting the
natural environment. In order to achieve these objectives,
New Zealand prioritizes the securing of operational
capabilities in the primary operation area that stretches
from the South Pole to the Equator. The country believes
that challenges to the existing order of the Asia-Pacific
region could impact its security and prosperity and that
it is important to have defense capabilities that can
globally support the maintenance of the international
rule-based order. The Statement also mentioned other
priorities, including capabilities to operate effectively

which primarily focuses on strengthening strategic
relations in the fields of foreign policy and military
affairs, and the Washington Declaration (2012), which
mainly deals with expanding defense cooperation. New
Zealand has thus established the United States as a very
close strategic partner. While New Zealand has deepened
its relationship with China through such initiatives as
cooperation for the “Belt and Road” Initiative and joint
air exercises, it also looks at China with a cautious eye as
shown in the Strategic Defence Policy Statement 2018.
The NZDF has 9,400 personnel.[4] It has contributed
to the peace and stability of the region through such
activities as engaging in monitoring and surveillance
activities by patrol aircraft against illegal maritime


activities, including illicit ship-to-ship transfers
involving North Korean-flagged vessels prohibited under
the UN Security Council resolution, and dispatching
its personnel to the United Nations Command Military
Armistice Commission (UNCMAC) in the ROK, and to
other operations in the Middle East and the South Pacific.
In June 2019, the New Zealand Government published
the “Defence Capability Plan 2019,” which sets out
planned investments of NZ$20 billion until 2030.
Investments under the Plan are: strengthening of the
relationship with the Pacific Island countries; response to
the climate crisis; and acquisition of vessels, helicopters,
transport aircraft and others to strengthen the maritime
surveillance capability.

the two countries agreed to resume the long-distance
railway project after making cost reductions, and the
Malaysian and Chinese companies involved signed a
supplementary agreement.
In February 2020, the Malaysian king appointed
Muhyiddin Yassin as the country’s next prime minister,
after receiving a letter of resignation from Prime
Minister Mahathir. Muhyiddin was sworn in as prime
minister that March.
Since December 2019, Malaysia has been confirming
Chinese ships’ activities around its own drillship West
Capella, while in April 2020, the Chinese government
survey ship “Haiyang Dizhi 8” was also observed near
the West Capella. In the same month, the United States
and Australia carried out joint exercises in the area
surrounding the West Capella, and in May 2020, U.S.
Littoral Combat Ship (LCS) also conducted presence
operations near the West Capella.
As well as conducting joint exercises with the United
States such as “CARAT” and “SEACAT,” Malaysia has
been promoting military cooperation including capacity
building in the maritime security field.

Malaysia’s first defense white paper, which was
published in December 2019, highlights the country’s
geography as a nation with two territories—Peninsular
Malaysia, and Sabah and Sarawak, on the island of
Borneo—located between the vast Pacific and Indian
Oceans. The document identifies Malaysia’s potential to
serve as a bridging linchpin between the two oceans, and
also demonstrates an awareness of the fact that, while
Malaysia’s strategic location and natural resources are
a blessing, they also pose a challenge. Given these
attributes, Malaysia has historically been affected by
the political dynamics of major powers. Even today,
Malaysia sees in its defense white paper that uncertain
big power relations, which refers to the U.S.-China, is the
most important strategic factor for Malaysia. Moreover,
the white paper also demonstrates an awareness that
Malaysia faces increasing non-traditional security
threats such as terrorism, cyberthreats, piracy, and
natural disasters.
Based on this recognition, Malaysia’s defense policy
aims to defend national interests in each of three
concentric areas of interest, consisting of the Core Area,
which includes both the country’s land masses and its
territorial waters; the Extended Area, which encompasses
the surrounding waters and airspace; and the Forward
Area, which incorporates locations beyond the extended
area where Malaysia’s national interests are affected.
The policy consists of three key pillars: (1) “Concentric
Deterrence,” which aims to deter all forms of external
intrusion or conflicts by enhancing the capability of the
nation’s armed forces; (2) “Comprehensive Defense,”
which seeks to build resilience as a nation throughout
society, including among the people; and (3) “Credible
Partnerships,” which focuses on the promotion of
regional stability via the expansion and enhancement
of defense cooperation with other countries as a highly
credible partner.
In connection with the recent continued anchoring of

Myanmar shares borders with China and India and is a
gateway to the Indian Ocean for China and some ASEAN
countries. In light of these factors, Myanmar is noted for

its strategic significance. In Myanmar, the armed forces
had control over the government following the collapse of
the socialist regime in 1988. However, with an economic
slowdown caused by the economic sanctions imposed by
the West, transition to civilian rule based on the road map
to democracy was completed.
Including the release of political prisoners and
ceasefire agreements with ethnic minorities, the
Government of Myanmar has actively taken steps toward
democratization. The international community has shown
some level of appreciation for these steps, with the West,
including the United States, easing economic sanctions
on Myanmar.
However, following an August 2017 attack on a
police station by Arakan Rohingya Salvation Army
(ARSA), forces including Myanmar’s military launched
mop-up operations in Rakhine state and more than
600,000 refugees — primarily Muslims — fleeing to
the neighboring country, Bangladesh, in two months.
Western countries denounced Myanmar for the purported
massacre and human rights violation.
In November 2020, Myanmar’s parliamentary election
was held for the first time in five years and the ruling
National League for Democracy (NLD) party secured
seats that greatly exceeded the required half in both the
upper and lower houses to win a single-party majority.
However, in February 2021, State Counsellor Aung San
Suu Kyi and her party’s senior members were detained by
Myanmar’s military, which was claiming election fraud.
The acting President with a military connection declared
a state of emergency to carry out a coup d’état, and power
was handed over to the commander-in-chief. In addition
to the UN Secretary-General, who condemned the
coup, more condemnation and deep concerns have been
expressed by many countries, calling for the immediate
release of detained government senior officials and
returning to a democratic process.
In terms of foreign policy, the Government of Myanmar
has upheld a policy of neutrality and non-alignment,
while for its national defense policy, continued to
emphasize the three national causes of Non-disintegration
of the Union, Non-disintegration of National Solidarity,
and Perpetuation of Sovereignty, as well as resolutely
repelling foreign invasions and interference in domestic
matters. While no specific policies of the post-coup
administration have been released, it has set a goal
to continue implementing the principle of peaceful
coexistence by maintaining independent and active nonaligned diplomacy.
Similarly, China has maintained a good relationship
with Myanmar since the two countries established
diplomatic relations in 1950 and is regarded as a major
supplier of equipment Myanmar has also received


Chinese aid for pipeline construction and the development
of Kyaukpyu Port. In January 2020, President Xi Jinping
became the first Chinese leader to visit Myanmar for 19
years and affirmed China’s policy of promoting economic
cooperation through the BRI.
Myanmar has maintained a cooperative relationship
with Russia in the military field, including the period of
the past military regime, and Russia was a destination for
students from Myanmar and a supplier of major defense
equipment. As for India, since the transition to civilian
rule, Myanmar has deepened cooperative relations in
the fields of the economy and military, which resulted in
defense cooperation and exchanges such as the hosting
of various seminars and friendly visits to Myanmar by
Indian naval vessels.
Cooperative relations with North Korea, including
weapons trades, were maintained under Myanmar’s
military regime in the past. Following the transition to
democracy, although Myanmar denied that it had military
ties to North Korea, the report issued by the Panel of
Experts of the UN Security Council Sanctions Committee
on North Korea in March 2018 reported that the country
has received a ballistic missile system and other weapons
from North Korea.

**4 The Philippines**


**Chapter**


The Philippines considers that its archipelagic attributes
and geographic location are a source of both strength and
vulnerability. Moreover, the country sees that its strategic
location and rich natural resources have also provided a
strong temptation to expansionist powers. Based on this
perception, although resolving internal armed conflicts
remains its top security concern, rising tensions in the
South China Sea have prompted the Philippines to give
the same attention to territorial defense as it does to
internal security threats.
The Philippines, with a historically close relationship
with the United States, has maintained a cooperative
relationship with the United States under their mutual
defense treaty and military assistance agreement, even
after the withdrawal of the U.S. Forces in 1992. The
two countries conduct a number of bilateral exercises,
including Balikatan, KAMANDAG, and Maritime
Training Activity Sama Sama. In March 2016, the two
countries agreed on five locations for carrying out defense
cooperation under the Enhanced Defense Cooperation
Agreement (EDCA) they signed in April 2014 for
strengthening cooperation in such areas as the capacity
enhancement of the Armed Forces of the Philippines and
disaster relief: Antonio Bautista Air Base, Basa Air Base,
Fort Magsaysay, Lumbia Air Base, and Mactan-Benito
Ebuen Air Base During his visit to the Philippines in


-----

March 2019, U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo
made it clear that the South China Sea is part of the
Pacific Ocean and thus any armed attack on Philippine
forces, aircraft, or vessels in the South China Sea would
trigger mutual defense obligations under the Mutual
Defense Treaty. In September 2019, the United States
and the Philippines held the Mutual Defense Board and
Security Engagement Board (MDB-SEB), at which they
reaffirmed the importance of their defense cooperation.
Meanwhile, the Government of the Philippines notified in
January 2020 its intention to terminate the Visiting Forces
Agreement (VFA), which prescribed the legal status of
U.S. military personnel when U.S. Forces undertook joint
military exercises or other activities in the Philippines.
However, in June 2020, the Philippines notified the
United States of suspending the termination procedures
for six months and of further six-month suspension again
in November. Attention will be paid to further action by
the two countries.
The Philippines and China have competing claims
over the sovereignty of the Spratly Islands and
Scarborough Shoal in the South China Sea. Seeking
a settlement under international law, in January 2013,
the Philippines launched arbitral tribunal proceedings
pursuant to UNCLOS against China. In July 2016,
a final award was rendered, accepting nearly all of
the Philippines’ submissions. The Government of the
Philippines released a statement that it welcomed the
award by the arbitral tribunal and strongly affirms its
respect for the decision. Also, President Duterte stated in
his State of the Nation Address held in the same month
that the Philippines would strongly affirm and uphold
the award handed down for the arbitration case between
the Philippines and China. In September 2019, the Office
of the President of the Philippines revealed that China
had vowed to adopt a 60-40 sharing scheme favoring
the Philippines in the proposed joint development of
resources in the South China Sea in exchange for setting
aside the arbitral court ruling. The Office of the President
of the Philippines, however, made it clear that it would
not abandon the ruling.
In April 2019, the Philippines criticized China when it
confirmed the presence of more than 200 Chinese vessels
near and around Thitu Island (Filipino name: Pag-asa
Island), which is occupied by the Philippines. In June,
in response to a claim that the Chinese aircraft carrier
“Liaoning” and other ships had passed through the Sibutu
Strait, Secretary of National Defense Lorenzana said that
it was not innocent passage.
The conflicts between the Philippines and China over


the South China Sea dispute were observed even in 2020
during which the COVID-19 infections became a global
pandemic. The Philippines protested against China that
a Chinese military vessel had directed fire-control radar
at a Philippine Navy ship in February 2020, and that
China had established administrative districts on islands
in the South China Sea in April of the same year. In July
2020, responding to China’s announcement of its plan
to conduct military training in the South China Sea,
Secretary of Foreign Affairs. Teodoro Locsin expressed
his concerns in a video. Moreover, regarding the fact that
“220 Chinese militia ships were confirmed in the South
China Sea” in March 2021, the Department of National
Defense of the Philippines accused China of conducting
“a clear provocation of the militarization” of the South
China Sea, and asked for withdrawal. In response, the
Chinese side claimed its sovereignty over Whitsun Reef,
and then denied the existence of Chinese militia ships
and explained that “some fishing ships had to evacuate
Whitsun Reef due to the bad weather.”
The Philippines calls for a peaceful resolution of the
conflict based on the United Nations Convention on the
Law of the Sea and other international laws. In September
2020, during the UN General Assembly, President Duterte
remarked, “The Award (in the Arbitration between China
and the Philippines) is now part of international law…We
firmly reject attempts to undermine it.”

Freedom of the High Seas”), p. 189

**5 Singapore**


**Chapter**


Given its limited land area, population, and resources,
Singapore’s existence and development depend on the
peace and stability of the region in a globalized economy.
Singapore gives high priority to national defense, with
defense spending accounting for about one-fifth of its
national budget.
Singapore identifies deterrence and diplomacy as twin
pillars of its national defense policy. Because it is a very
small country, Singapore’s armed forces make use of the
training facilities of other countries, including the United
States and Australia, while continually dispatching military
personnel to take part in training exercises overseas.
Singapore emphasizes the importance of cooperative
relations with ASEAN and the FPDA,[3] and has concluded
defense cooperation agreements with countries within
and outside the region. With the aim of contributing to
peace and stability in the region, Singapore supports
U.S. presence in the Asia-Pacific and permits it to use

military facilities in Singapore. Since 2013, U.S. littoral
combat ships (LCSs) began their rotational deployments.
In December 2015, the P-8 patrol aircraft of the U.S.
Forces were deployed to Singapore for around one week
for the first time. The two countries have committed to
continuing to carry out similar deployments routinely.
In addition, Singapore conducts joint exercises with
the United States, such as CARAT and SEACAT. In
September 2019, the two countries signed the Protocol of
Amendment to the 1990 Memorandum of Understanding
Regarding United States Use of Facilities in Singapore.
Singapore has strong economic ties with China. Both
countries also conduct joint naval exercises. In October
2019, the two countries signed the enhanced Agreement
on Defence Exchanges and Security Cooperation
(ADESC). On the other hand, diplomatic relations with
China have been strained partly due to Singapore’s belief
in following the arbitration award when it comes to the
resolution of the South China Sea disputes and partly due
to Singapore’s defense relationship with Taiwan.
Singapore concluded the Bilateral Agreement for
Navy Cooperation with India in November 2017 and
the two countries undertake Exercise Bold Kurukshetra,
a bilateral armor exercise, and the Singapore India
Maritime Bilateral Exercise (SIMBEX). In addition,
Singapore, India, and Thailand held their first trilateral
joint exercise in September 2019, which took place near
the Andaman Islands.
In March 2020, Singapore and Australia signed
the Treaty on Military Training and Training Area
Development in Australia. This treaty enables the
Singapore Armed Forces to access Australia’s newly
developed training area. On the other hand, in May
2020, the Ministry of Defense of Singapore announced
that it would cancel all the overseas exercises including
the country’s largest-scale overseas exercise “Exercise
Wallaby” in response to the COVID-19 pandemic.

and Thailand and has been implemented since 1982,
is currently one of the largest multilateral exercises in
Southeast Asia.
After the coup in May 2014, the United States scaled
down the size of U.S. forces participating in Exercise
Cobra Gold. However, this was restored under the Trump
Administration and was carried out even in 2020 despite
the COVID-19 pandemic. In addition, the Marine Corps
of the two countries have continued their bilateral naval
training CARAT and counter-piracy and trafficking
exercise SEACAT, and the Royal Thai Army participated
in the U.S. Army’s Exercise Lightening Forge conducted
in Hawaii in July 2020.
Thailand and China have conducted joint exercises
such as Blue Strike among their marines and Falcon
Strike among their air forces. It has been pointed out that
Thailand’s military relationship with China has become
closer after the freezing of U.S. military assistance
following the coup.
In September 2019, Thailand and the ROK signed
the General Security of Military Information Agreement
(GSOMIA).

**7 Vietnam**


Based on its viewpoint that the sea is closely associated
with the national construction and defense, Vietnam has
established the objective of becoming a strong marine
country, particularly prioritizing the modernization of
its military forces and law enforcement forces at sea
as well as ensuring the capability to properly handle
sea situations, maritime independence, sovereignty,
sovereign rights, jurisdiction and national interests at sea.
Vietnam deploys its omni-directional diplomatic
policy and intends to actively participate in international
and regional cooperation in order to build friendly
relations with every nation. In March 2016, Vietnam
opened an international port in the Cam Ranh Bay a


Thailand’s defense policy includes: strengthening defense
cooperation through ASEAN, international organizations,
and other entities; defense that makes comprehensive use
of political, economic, and other national strengths; and
effective defense aimed at increasing the readiness of the
Royal Thai Armed Forces (RTAF) and developing the
defense industry.
Under its flexible omni-directional diplomatic policy,
Thailand pursues cooperation with other Southeast
Asian countries and coordination with major countries.

including Japan have called at the international Cam
Ranh Bay port.
Vietnam and the United States have strengthened their
military relations in recent years. This has taken such
forms as joint exercises with the U.S. Navy and port calls
by U.S. Navy vessels in Vietnam. In 2017, mutual visits
were conducted by the leaders of both countries, and
an agreement was reached on the deepening of defense
cooperation. March 2018 marked the first port call by
a U.S. aircraft carrier to Vietnam since the end of the
Vietnam war. In addition, the U.S. aircraft carrier and
cruiser made a call at Da Nang in March 2020.
Vietnam and Russia continue to strengthen cooperation
in the area of national defense, with Vietnam dependent
on Russia for the majority of its defense equipment.
In April 2018, the two countries signed a military and
technical cooperation roadmap, while in July 2019, a
Vietnamese naval vessel visited the port of Vladivostok
for the first time. In December 2019, a submarine rescue
vessel from Russia’s Pacific Fleet visited the port of Cam
Ranh and participated in the first bilateral joint submarine
rescue exercise.

Vietnam and China, under their comprehensive
strategic cooperation partnership relations, proactively
conduct exchanges among their senior government
officials. However, the two countries have competing
claims concerning issues such as sovereignty over the

their defense spending against the backdrop of economic
development and other reasons, and are modernizing
their military forces, focusing on inducting equipment
such as submarines and fighters, including fourthgeneration modern fighters. On the other hand, the
countries that prioritize the implementation of COVID-19
countermeasures have announced defense budget cuts
and postponements of equipment procurement, indicating
the impact on military modernization.
In February 2018, Indonesia concluded an agreement
to purchase an additional 11 Su-35 fighters from Russia.
With the ROK, Indonesia concluded an agreement to
purchase three ROK-made 209-class submarines, the
third of which was reportedly produced in Indonesia
and completed diving trials in January 2020. In January
2016, the two countries also concluded a detailed
agreement on cost sharing and bilateral cooperation

refrain from activities that would complicate matters.
However, they have disputes regarding resources
development and the operation of fishing boats. The
defense white paper published in November 2019
demonstrates an awareness that Vietnam and China
need to be settled with precaution, avoiding negative
impacts on general peace, friendship, and cooperation
for development between the two countries. As such,
it recognizes that the two countries should continue
negotiations and consultations to find peaceful solutions
on the basis of international law.
Vietnam and India have been deepening their
cooperative relationship in a broad range of areas,
including security and economy. In the area of defense
cooperation, it is noted that the Indian Armed Forces
support the training of Vietnam’s Navy submarine
personnel and Air Force pilots, and Indian Navy vessels
make friendly visits to Vietnam. In September 2016,
Prime Minister Modi became the first Indian prime
minister to visit Vietnam in 15 years. During the visit an
agreement was reached on raising the status of the bilateral
relationship to a comprehensive strategic partnership,
while an announcement was made concerning a loan
of US$500 million for deepening defense cooperation.
In November 2020, Vietnam and India held a defense
ministerial video teleconference, and the two countries
agreed to further promote defense cooperation.

announced a reduction of approximately 9 trillion rupiah
(approximately 63.8 billion yen) in the FY2020 defense
spending from the initial budget in order to secure the
budget for COVID-19 countermeasures.
Malaysia announced a plan to build six indigenous
LCSs. The first of these vessels was launched in August
2017. Furthermore, in November 2016, Malaysia
concluded an agreement with China to purchase four

In December 2019, Myanmar received a Kilo-class
submarine, named Minye Theinkhathu, from India. The
procurement of the country’s first submarine is attracting
attention from neighboring countries.
The Philippines has taken steps in recent years to
modernize its defense equipment against the backdrop of
conflicts over territorial rights in the South China Sea.
In terms of air force capabilities, between November
2015 and May 2017, the Philippines successively
introduced 12 FA-50PH light fighters purchased from
the ROK. It is currently planning to initiate a multi-role
fighter program. In addition, the Philippines received six
A-29 light attack aircraft from Brazil as successors of
aging OV-10 light attack aircraft in October 2020, and
also held a delivery ceremony of eight US ScanEagle
unmanned aerial vehicles in November 2020.
As for naval forces, the Philippines received three
Hamilton-class frigates from the United States by 2016.
The Philippines introduced two Indonesian-made landing
dock vessels by 2017. In October 2016, the Philippines
concluded an agreement to purchase two frigates from the
ROK. The August 2019 commissioning of a Pohang-class
corvette received from the ROK marked the restoration
of the antisubmarine capability that the Philippines had
long lacked. That September, the Philippines conducted
the DAGIT-PA multi-service military exercise involving
the army, navy, and air force, during which the four AAV7 assault amphibious vehicles that it had commissioned
the previous June were operated. In July 2020, the
Philippines conducted a commission ceremony of the
frigate “Jose Rizal,” which was the first frigate with
missile attack capabilities, procured from the ROK.

provide opportunities for dialogue on security issues.
Furthermore, ASEAN has made efforts to improve the
security environment in the region and promote mutual

also participates in the F-35 JSF Program. In January
2020, the U.S. Government officially approved the sale of
F-35B fighter jets to Singapore and delivered the required
certification notifying Congress of the sale.
As for Thailand, in July 2014, the country established
the Submarine Squadron Headquarters. In April 2017,
the Royal Thai Navy drew up a plan to purchase three
Yuan-class submarines from China over the next 11
years, and the Thai Cabinet approved the purchase of
one vessel. However, in April 2020, Thailand announced
that it would postpone the procurement of two Yuan-class
submarines from China in order to secure the budget for
COVID-19 countermeasures. In addition, the Cabinet
approved in September 2012 a plan to introduce two
frigates. The first frigate was received from the ROK in
December 2018. In September 2019, Thailand signed
an agreement to purchase a Type 071 landing platform
dock from China. In addition, by 2013, Thailand had
introduced 12 Swedish-made JAS-39 Gripen fighters.
In September 2019, it received the first 10 of 60 Stryker
armored vehicles purchased from the United States.
By January 2017, Vietnam successively introduced six
Russian-made Kilo-class submarines. By February 2018,
Vietnam started the operation of four Russian-made
Gepard-class frigates. As for its air force capabilities,
Vietnam started to successively introduce Russian-made
Su-30 fighters in 2004, and to date, the total number of
delivered Su-30 fighters came to 36. In January 2020,
it was reported that Vietnam had ordered 12 Yak-130
training aircraft from Russia. It is also due to receive six
ScanEagle UAVs from the United States by March 2022.

the United States held their first ASEAN-U.S. Maritime

Based on the nuclear doctrine of 2003, India
adheres to the following policies: credible minimum
deterrence, the no-first-use nuclear policy, no use against
non-nuclear weapon nations, and maintaining the
unilateral moratorium on nuclear tests that it announced
immediately after the nuclear test in 1998. India promotes
the development and deployment of various ballistic
missiles. As well as conducting the test launches of
“Agni 5” in December 2018 and “Agni 2” in November
2019, India has reportedly started developing “Agni
6,” which is believed to have a range of up to 10,000
km. It is deemed that the country aspires to extend the
ranges of ballistic missiles and make other performance
improvements. In regard to cruise missiles, India has
deployed the supersonic cruise missile “BrahMos”
jointly developed with Russia and is also developing the
hypersonic cruise missile “BrahMos II” and a ballistic
missile defense system.[2]

**3 Relations with Other Countries**


**(1) Relations with the United States**
India is actively striving to strengthen bilateral relations
with the United States. The two countries conduct the
exercises, such as Malabar[3] with Japan, on a regular
basis. In addition, in recent years, the United States has
become one of India’s major equipment procurement
destinations.[4]
When Prime Minister Modi visited the United States
in June 2016, the United States recognized that India is
a “Major Defense Partner.” In August 2016, in a joint
statement of the U.S. and Indian defense ministers,
the United States agreed to elevate defense trade and
technology sharing with India to a level commensurate
with its closest allies and partners. Also, a memorandum
was signed concerning logistics support cooperation.
In June 2017, Prime Minister Modi visited the United
States. At his first summit meeting with President Trump,
the two sides agreed to continue to strengthen their
strategic partnership. In September 2018, the first U.S.India “2+2” Meeting was held. In this meeting, the two
countries signed the Communications Compatibility
and Security Agreement (COMCASA), which aims to
promote access to advanced defense systems and ensure
the optimal use of a U.S.-made platform owned by India.
In November 2019, the two countries held their first triservice exercise “Tiger Triumph,” followed by the third
U.S.-India “2+2” Meeting in October 2020 in which the
Basic Exchange and Cooperation Agreement (BECA)

was concluded.

Reports specify these missiles as follows. Agni 5: a mobile, three-stage solid-fueled ballistic missile with a range of about 5,000-8,000 km. Agni 6: a three-stage solid/liquid-fueled ballistic missile
with a range of about 8,000-10,000 km. BrahMos: a solid/Ramjet supersonic cruise missile with a range of about 300-500 km. Also, India is reportedly developing a ballistic missile defense system.
According to reports, it is a two-stage intercept system consisting of a missile for high altitude interception (PAD) up to 80 km in altitude and a missile for low altitude interception (AAD) up to 30 km
in altitude.

Malabar was initially a bilateral maritime exercise between the United States and India, while Japan has participated in this exercise since 2007. From 2017 to 2019, Malabar was conducted as a
trilateral exercise among Japan, the United States and India. In November 2020, Malabar was conducted as a quadrilateral exercise by involving Australia.

and conducted its first nuclear test in 1998.
Pakistan has been actively proceeding with the
development of ballistic missiles and cruise missiles
capable of carrying nuclear warheads, and has
conducted a number of test launches in recent years.
In 2015, Pakistan conducted two test launches of the
ballistic missile “Shaheen 3” in March and December,
and a test launch from an aircraft of the cruise missile
“Raad” in January 2016. Pakistan also conducted
its first test launch of the ballistic missile “Ababeel,”
which is capable of delivering multiple warheads, using
Multiple Independently-Targetable Re-entry Vehicle
(MIRV) technology, in January 2017. Like it did in
the previous year, it conducted another test fire of the
submarine launched cruise missile “Babur” in March
2018. Pakistan is thought to be steadily increasing
the capabilities of its missiles, firing the “Shaheen 1”
ballistic missile in November 2019, following India’s
launch of a ballistic missile.[5]
Pakistan jointly developed the Al-Khalid tank and the
JF-17 fighter aircraft with China. It is currently using the
85 indigenously produced JF-17 Block I and Block II
aircraft, and has begun manufacture of the JF- 17 Block
III. Pakistan is reportedly also planning to purchase from
China eight submarines, which Pakistan is positioning as
the “backbone of the Navy.” Four will be built in China,
with the remainder to be built in Pakistan.

**1 General Situation**

Wedged between the powerful South Asian nation of
India and politically-unstable Afghanistan, and sharing
borders with China and Iran, Pakistan is placed in a
geopolitically significant and complex position. In
particular, Islamic extremists conduct activities across
the Pakistan-Afghanistan border, and Pakistan’s attitude
towards the war against terrorism draws much attention
from the international community.
While supporting the United States’ war against
terrorism in Afghanistan, the Government of Pakistan
has been struggling as its domestic security situation has
worsened, with issues such as growing anti-U.S. sentiment
and retaliatory terrorism by Islamic extremists. Although
the Pakistan Armed Forces’ reinforced operation to
crackdown on militant groups has reportedly drastically
decreased terrorism, terrorist attacks have continued to
occur sporadically.
Against such a backdrop, the Pakistani Government
has continued its counter-terrorism operation, “Raddul-Fasaad,” since 2017, while also working on the
construction of fences and guarding stations along
the border with Afghanistan to prevent the entrance of
extremist groups.

Amid ongoing tense relations between the two
countries, Prime Minister Imran Khan visited the
United States in July 2019 and held his first summit
meeting with President Trump. During these talks, they
exchanged views on anti-terrorism measures and peace
in Afghanistan, as well as discussed ways of restoring the
two countries’ relationship. Just before Prime Minister
Khan’s visit to the United States, Pakistan sought to
highlight its anti-terrorism efforts to the United States by
arresting Hafiz Saeed, a co-founder of the Pakistan-based
Islamist extremist group Lashkar-e-Taiba, on whom
the U.S. Government had placed a bounty for being a
ringleader of the 2008 Mumbai attacks. After the talks,
Prime Minister Khan disclosed his feeling that the two
countries had gained a deeper understanding of each
other, stressing that “Pakistan will do everything possible
to ensure that this [Afghan] peace process goes forward.”
With the desire for an improvement in relations evident
in such developments, the response by both countries
will be the focus of attention.

**3 Relations with Other Countries**

**(1) Relations with the United States**
Besides supporting the activities of the U.S. Forces
in Afghanistan, Pakistan cooperates with the war on
terror by launching mop-up operations against Islamic
extremists in the Pakistan-Afghanistan border area.
Meanwhile, Pakistan urges the United States to
immediately end its drone attacks on Islamic extremists
in Pakistani territory, and the Pakistani Government has
protested repeatedly.
The United States, on the other hand, has condemned
Pakistan for allowing Islamic extremists in Afghanistan
to take haven, which poses a threat to the United States.
In August 2017, President Trump stated, “No partnership
can survive a country’s harboring of militants and
terrorists who target U.S. Service members.” In the same
month, the United States announced the suspension
of US$205 million in Foreign Military Assistance to
Pakistan, which was provided by the Department of State
(DOS). Following this, it also announced the suspension
of DOS’ security assistance to Pakistan in January 2018
and the suspension of US$300 million of the Coalition
Support Funds in September 2018.

and reconstruction assistance; and (3) cooperative
security including active contribution to arms control,
disarmament, and non-proliferation. In June 2020,
NATO announced the launch of the NATO 2030
initiative, which aims to strengthen NATO’s functions.
In this initiative, policies for more political use of
NATO are considered in order to address all of the major
challenges faced by NATO, such as the rise of China,
cyber attacks, disruptive technology, climate change,
and Russia’s active military activities.
In light of changes in the security environment, and
the expanding gap of defense expenditure between the
United States and other member states, NATO member
states in 2014 agreed on the goal to allocate 2% or more
of their GDP to defense spending by 2024. The London
Declaration was adopted at NATO’s 70th anniversary
summit in December 2019. The participating leaders
reaffirmed therein their solemn commitment to
collective defense as enshrined in Article 5 of the
Washington Treaty and stated that they will increase
defense expenditure further.
At the same summit, the rise of China was discussed
for the first time, and the London Declaration stated
the understanding that China’s growing influence and
international policies would present both opportunities
and challenges, which needed to be addressed together as
an alliance. In his June 2020 remarks on the NATO 2030
initiative, NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg
mentioned that NATO would “need to work even more
closely with like-minded countries. Like Australia,
Japan, New Zealand, and South Korea” to deal with
China coming closer to NATO’s domain (the Arctic,
cyberspace, etc.). Representatives from Asian countries
in partnership with NATO also participated in the NATO
Foreign Ministers’ Meeting in December 2020 and
discussed cooperation for addressing the rise of China.
Following Russia’s development of “hybrid warfare”
as well as the frequent “unusual flights” of Russian
Armed Force aircraft over northern and eastern Europe,
including the Baltic states, NATO and member states have
recognized the threat posed by Russia and are working to
bolster deterrence. At the NATO Summit in September
2014, leaders adopted a joint declaration demanding
Russia to retract its “annexation” of Crimea and adopted
the Readiness Action Plan (RAP) for enhancing existing
readiness forces.[1] Based on this plan, NATO has continued
to maintain its presence in eastern allies, while steps have
been taken to significantly improve the readiness of the
existing multinational NATO Response Force (NRF)
and create the Very High Readiness Joint Task Force


(VJTF) that can be mobilized within two to three days.
Furthermore, at the NATO Summit in July 2016, members
decided to deploy four multinational battle groups to the
three Baltic nations and Poland on a rotational basis.
These became fully operational in 2017. At the NATO
Summit in July 2018, members decided to put in place a
readiness initiative called the “Four Thirties,” to maintain
a situation in which, by 2020, 30 mechanized battalions,
30 air squadrons, and 30 combat vessels can be ready
to be used within 30 days or less. They also decided on
reforms of the command headquarters, establishing the
Joint Force Command Norfolk in the United States with
the objective of strengthening the defense of Atlantic
sea lines of communications between the United States
and Europe, as well as establishing the Joint Support
and Enabling Command in Ulm, Germany, to expedite
the transport of troops and equipment within and
outside Europe. Views on Russia differ between NATO
member states against the backdrop of their different
geographical distances from Russia and others. While
taking measures to address Russian influence, NATO
members have maintained opportunities for dialogue
with Russia to narrow their differences in views and
increase predictability.
Alongside collective defense, NATO’s core tasks
include crisis management operations both within and
outside the region. In the Mediterranean, a permanent
maritime force has been deployed to the Aegean Sea since
February 2016 due to the influx of illegal immigrants
transiting the Mediterranean. This force monitors the
influx of illegal immigrants and shares information with
Turkey, Greece, and other countries. Also, Operation
Sea Guardian, which focuses on crisis management,
was launched in November 2016 and a wider array
of missions including counterterrorism and capacity
building assistance have been conducted.
Since January 2015, NATO has been leading the
Resolute Support Mission (RSM), whose primary tasks
are to provide training, advice, and assistance to the
Afghan National Defense and Security Forces (ANDSF).
At the NATO Summit in July 2018, NATO decided to
maintain its presence in Afghanistan until seeing signs
of changes in the local situation and enhance support
for Afghanistan by extending financial assistance for
ANDSF until 2024. It has stationed 17,000 personnel
in Afghanistan.
With regard to the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant
(ISIL), NATO has dispatched early warning and control
aircraft forces and implemented NATO surveillance and
reconnaissance missions since October 2016. NATO

announced the commencement of the new NATO
Mission Iraq (NMI) at the NATO Summit in July 2018,
providing training and capacity building assistance for
Iraqi security forces. At the February 2020 Meetings
of NATO Ministers of Defence, participants agreed to
enhance NATO’s training mission in Iraq, to contribute
to the stabilization of the situation in the Middle East.
In addition, at the February 2021 Meetings of NATO
Ministers of Defence, participants reached an agreement
regarding NATO’s training mission in Iraq to increase the
number of participating personnel from approximately
500 to 4,000 and expand the mission locations. NATO is
also carrying out missions in Kosovo and other countries.
While NATO plays a key role in advancing various
initiatives, some member states are facing clear
differences in their positions concerning regional
issues. For example, amid many countries’ calling for
the suspension of foreign intervention over the Libyan
Civil War including arms exports, Turkey has continued
to provide military assistance to Libya, which France
strongly denounced. Furthermore, in June 2020, when
a French military vessel attempted to inspect a Turkeyrelated ship suspected of violating the Libya Arms
Embargo in the eastern Mediterranean Sea, Turkish navy
vessels escorting the cargo ship irradiated the French
vessel, and France protested. Turkey denied the French
claim as groundless, while after this incident, France
announced that it would stop participating in “Operation
Sea Guardian.” Therefore, the issues surrounding Libya
have also been affecting NATO’s activities. Another
regional issue concerns the eastern Mediterranean Sea
in which gas exploration activities have been in progress
since 2009 at a large gas field discovered offshore of
Cyprus. However, Turkey considers it problematic that
Greece and other countries are jointly promoting energy
development without Turkey’s involvement, despite the
situation where the boundary including the Exclusive
Economic Zone (EEZ) has not been defined between
Turkey and these countries. Against this background, in
August 2020, Turkey began the exploitation of resources
in the disputed waters with Greece in order to protect its
national interest. Responding to Turkey’s move, Greece
and France strengthened their military presence in the
eastern Mediterranean Sea, which caused a collision
between Turkey and Greece vessels. NATO, seeing
the situation as a concern, embarked on the mediation
of consultations to establish a mechanism that would
prevent a military confrontation between Turkey and
Greece. The United States also requested the countries
concerned to reach a diplomatic resolution of the


situation, as the escalation of military tension would only
benefit the enemy hoping for cleavage in the unity among
the countries in the Atlantic region. Turkey also called
for resolution through dialogue, and it was announced in
January 2021 that bilateral discussions between Turkey
and Greece concerning resource surveys in the East
Mediterranean, which were discontinued in 2016, would
be launched in Istanbul.

**2 EU**


The EU seeks to enhance its security initiatives under
the Common Foreign and Security Policy (CFSP) and
Common Security and Defence Policy (CSDP),[2] and
in June 2016, the Global Strategy for the European
Union’s Foreign and Security Policy detailing the EU’s
fundamental approach to foreign and security policy
was adopted by the European Council for the first time
in approximately 10 years. This document calls for
initiatives towards enhancing the EU’s internal and
external resilience against threats to order in Eastern
Europe, and the threat of terrorism or other events in the
Middle East and Africa, in accordance with the principles
of rules-based order and democracy. In November 2016,
the European Commission released an action plan for
reinforcing defense cooperation in Europe, including the
establishment of the European Defence Fund (EDF).
In December 2017, the Permanent Structured
Cooperation (PESCO) was launched as a defense
cooperation framework for 25 countries among
the member countries. Under this framework, the
participating countries finance and cooperate in joint
projects including the joint development of equipment
and infrastructure that will contribute to developing
readiness. It is expected that the framework would
strengthen the EU’s defense capabilities. In this way,
the EU is trying to enhance capabilities for undertaking
security and its strategic independence by responding to
the present and future security demand in Europe.
In response to the crisis in Ukraine, the EU has
condemned the military measures of Russia and
implemented economic sanctions against Russia. In
addition, to support the economic and political reforms in
Ukraine, the EU continues its engagement in nonmilitary
affairs, including the provision of large-scale financial
assistance to Ukraine.
To deal with the threat of ISIL, the EU extends funds
to carry out humanitarian assistance for Syria and Iraq.
Additionally, the EU works with countries in regions such
as the Middle East and North Africa to provide capacity

building assistance in counterterrorism measures, among
other activities. In November 2015, in accordance with a
request from France after the terror attacks in Paris, the
EU, for the first time, activated the “mutual assistance
clause” stipulating a mutual defense obligation, and EU
member states provided their support to France.
Since 2003, the EU has proactively undertaken both
military operations and nonmilitary missions under
the CSDP.[3] Operation Atalanta, the EU’s first maritime
mission to combat piracy, has been under way off
the coast of Somalia and in the Gulf of Aden since
December 2008. Under this mission, vessels and aircraft
dispatched from each country protect ships in the area
and conduct surveillance in these waters. In addition,
those vessels and aircraft conduct joint exercises with
SDF units. Since July 2017, the scope of activities has
been expanded through the assignation of new missions,
including reconnaissance on illegal transactions in
crude oil exported from Libya and information sharing
with relevant organizations on human trafficking. Since
March 2020, a maritime operation in the Mediterranean,
Operation IRINI, whose primary mission is to monitor
the arms embargo against Libya, has been conducted.

In the same month, the British Ministry of Defence

**1 The United Kingdom**

released a Defence Command Paper Presented to


After the end of the Cold War, the United Kingdom,
perceiving that there is no direct military threat against
the country, has advanced national defense reform with
particular focus on improving its overseas deployment
capability and readiness, in order to deal with new
threats such as international terrorism and proliferation
of WMDs.
In March 2021, the Johnson administration released the
“Integrated Review of Security, Defence, Development,
and Foreign Policy” (Integrated Review). Replacing the
2015 National Security Strategy and the Strategic Defence
and Security Review (NSS/SDSR), the Integrated Review
sets out a comprehensive strategy including foreign policy
and development to adapt to a more competitive age
under the post-Brexit foreign policy, “Global Britain.”
As the trends that influence the U.K. and international
order, the U.K. Government identified the following four
contexts as particularly important: geopolitical shifts such
as the growing importance of the Indo-Pacific; systemic
competition between democratic and authoritarian values
and systems; rapid technological changes; transnational
challenges, such as climate change.


**3 Cooperation between NATO and the EU**

Advancements have been seen in cooperation between
NATO and the EU in addressing unprecedented
challenges efficiently. At the NATO Summit in July 2016,
a joint declaration was released citing hybrid threats,
cybersecurity and other fields in which NATO and the EU
should prioritize cooperation. The NATO Summit in July
2018 issued a joint declaration that identified substantial
progress in NATO-EU cooperation and cited the mobility
of military forces, counterterrorism and other fields for
further cooperation. Based on these declarations, the EU’s
PESCO includes a project for developing arrangements
for smooth movement of military personnel and assets
inside and outside the EU and is expected to contribute
to NATO’s quick military deployment in an emergency.
In this way, NATO and the EU are advancing their
cooperation in a manner to complement each other for
the purpose of enhancing security initiatives.

In the same month, the British Ministry of Defence
released a Defence Command Paper Presented to
Parliament, titled the “Defence in a Competitive Age,”
which supplements the Integrated Review and presents
details of the U.K.’s defense. The Ministry of Defence
proposed in this paper to increase the defense budget,
prioritize the investment in the newer domains of
cyberspace and space, upgrade vessels and aircraft, and
reduce the army troops to deal with various threats, while
also indicated the increase in the overall nuclear warhead
stockpile and the implementation of enhancing nuclear
deterrent capabilities.
The United Kingdom also expressed its intention to play
more active roles in maintaining the international order,
while maintaining and strengthening the relationship
with the United States, European countries, and NATO,
as well as noting the government’s tilt to the Indo-Pacific.
Specifically, the U.K. Government showed its posture to
work with Indo-Pacific partners to uphold freedom of
navigation and international law, such as the deployment
of carrier strike groups led by the Royal Navy’s aircraft
carrier HMS Queen Elizabeth in 2021, and capacity
building and enhanced training with ASEAN countries.

will take a leading role in efforts to strengthen the EU’s
defense capabilities. In June 2018, the Military Planning
Law for 2019-2025 was enacted, consisting of four
pillars — human resources, equipment modernization,
contributions to Europe’s strategic independence, and
technological innovation — to materialize the national
security strategy given in the Strategic Review. The
law confirms a plan to allocate a total of approximately
300 billion euros to defense by 2025 to fulfill President
Macron’s commitment to the goal of raising defense
spending to 2% of France’s GDP by 2025.
Having positioned the fight against ISIL as one
of its top national defense priorities, France has
been conducting airstrikes against ISIL in Iraq since
September 2014 and in Syria since September 2015.
The aircraft carrier “Charles de Gaulle” supported
anti-ISIL operations while at sea in the eastern
Mediterranean in April 2019 and was among the naval
task force dispatched to the eastern Mediterranean for
a month in January 2020 to provide similar operational
support. Following this, France killed the leader of al
Qaeda in the Sahel region in June 2020, and launched
the operation of the Takuba task force, composed of
European special forces, in July of the same year. In
addition, France has continued to provide education and
training to the Iraqi Security Forces and Peshmerga, as
well as humanitarian assistance for refugees.
In January 2020, France and seven other European
nations, including the Netherlands and Denmark, issued
a political statement supporting the creation of the
European Maritime Awareness in the Strait of Hormuz
(EMASOH) surveillance mission, which has been
launched in response to a series of incidents affecting the
safe passage of civilian vessels in the Gulf of Oman since
May 2019. Before the month was out, France dispatched
a frigate to the gulf, where it has been conducting warning
and surveillance operations.
Since France has territories in the Indo-Pacific region,
it is the only EU member state that has continuous
military presence in the region, with approximately 6,000
personnel and vessels permanently stationed. Placing
importance on its commitment to the region, France
points out in the Strategic Review the potential for a threat
to interests, such as the freedom of navigation, due to the
worsening strategic situation in the Asia-Pacific region,
and clearly states that France will maintain its stance of
protecting the sovereignty of its overseas territories in the
Pacific Ocean and the Indian Ocean. France’s Defence
Strategy in the Indo-Pacific, which was published in June
2019, states that China’s growing influence is shifting
the balances of power in the Indo-Pacific region and
highlights the importance of strengthening partnerships
with the United States Australia India and Japan In


HMS “Montrose” (U.K.), which came to Japan to monitor illicit ship-to-ship transfers

illicit maritime activities, including ship-to-ship transfers
with North Korean vessels, the Royal Navy frigate HMS
“Argyll” conducted surveillance activities in sea areas
surrounding Japan, including the East China Sea, in
December 2018 and January 2019, while the frigate HMS
“Montrose” did the same between late February and early
March 2019. Japan and the United Kingdom have also
been cooperating in the sharing of information, with
the aim of enhancing the effectiveness of UN Security
Council resolutions.
In the Integrated Review, the United Kingdom states
the intention to deepen its engagement in the region
in the decade ahead to establish a greater and more
sustainable presence than any other European country.
Going forward, attention will focus on the U.K.’s move
in relation to its involvement in the region.

**2 France**

Since the end of the Cold War, France has focused on
maintaining independence of its defense policies, while
having led initiatives to enhance the defense structure and
capability in Europe. It has worked on the development
of its military capacity by streamlining and integrating
military bases, dealing with operational requirements to
strengthen its defense capability, as well as enhancing
its intelligence capabilities and modernizing equipment
required in the future.
The Defence and National Security Strategic Review
announced by the Macron administration in October
2017 states that the threats that France faces, including
domestic terrorism, the refugee issue, and the Ukraine
crisis, are diversifying, increasing in complexity,
and rapidly becoming more violent, and amidst the
increasingly multipolar international system, competition
is intensifying among major military powers and the
danger of escalation is growing. Under these conditions,
France will fulfill its duties within NATO, including
for collective defense and contributing to security and


-----

addition, France has proactively organized the multilateral
exercises Croix du Sud and Equateur in the South Pacific.
In February 2018, France had the frigate “Vendémiaire”
make a port call in Japan and conduct joint exercises
with the Maritime Self-Defense Force (MSDF). In
March 2019, a carrier strike group including the aircraft
carrier “Charles de Gaulle” left France, and conducted a
multilateral exercise with Australian, U.S. and Japanese
ships including MSDF Destroyer JS “Izumo” in May
2019, when the group was deployed in the Indian
Ocean. Furthermore, France dispatched Falcon 200
reconnaissance aircraft to conduct surveillance activities
against illicit maritime activities, including ship-to-ship
transfers with North Korean vessels. In 2019, the frigate
“Vendémiaire” conducted surveillance activities in sea
areas surrounding Japan including the East China Sea.
From the viewpoint of enhancing the effectiveness of
the UN Security Council resolutions, Japan and France
engaged in cooperation activities, including information
sharing. As part of the long-term distant voyage mission
conducted from 2020 to 2021, the French nuclear attack
submarine “Émeraude” patrolled the South China Sea.
After the completion of the activities, French Minister
for the Armed Forces Florence Parly noted that France
conducted the patrol mission, “To enrich our knowledge
of this area and to affirm that international law is the only
rule that is valid, whatever the sea in which we sail.” In
this mission, the French nuclear attack submarine called at
a base in the west of Australia, carried out joint exercises
with Australian frigates, called at a port in Guam, and then
participated in the Japan-France-U.S. trilateral exercise
in the seas around Okinotorishima Island in December
2020. In January 2021, France released the Strategic
Update 2021, a supplementary version of the 2017
Defense and National Security Strategic Review. France,
in this update, expresses its vigilance against Russia’s
strategic intimidation and China’s maritime expansion to
the South China Sea, and its intention to engage more
in the Indo-Pacific, stating that it will contribute to the
region particularly in cooperation with Japan, Australia
and India.

environment, in May 2016 Germany changed policy and
announced that it would increase military personnel by
around 7,000 by 2023.
The country’s defense white paper released in
July 2016 for the first time in about 10 years explains
that Germany’s security environment has grown
more complex and unstable, causing gradually rising
uncertainty, citing specific threats such as international
terrorism, cyber attacks, interstate conflict, and the influx
of refugees and immigrants. The white paper also states
that Germany would continue to emphasize multilateral
cooperation and cross-government approaches, while
striving to realize rules-based international order.
In Iraq, Germany has provided support for capacity
building, including providing education and training to
the Iraqi Security Forces since 2015. In December 2015
following the terror attacks in Paris in November 2015,
Germany expanded logistics support missions, such as
reconnaissance and aerial refueling, for the Coalition
that was conducting counter-ISIL military operations.
Reconnaissance missions were completed in March 2020,
while in October 2020, Germany decided to extend its
logistical support missions, such as the capacity building
assistance mission and aerial refuelling mission, until
January 31, 2022.
In September 2020, the cabinet decision was made on
the Policy Guidelines for the Indo-Pacific Region, which
stipulated diplomatic guidelines for the Indo-Pacific. In
the guidelines, Germany states the intention to strengthen
its security policy engagement in the Indo-Pacific and
clarifies its stance of emphasizing the cooperation with
partners with shared values including Japan. As specific
initiatives, monitoring UN sanctions against North
Korea, taking part in exercises in the region, expanding
the forms of maritime presence, expanding cybersecurity
cooperation and other efforts are mentioned. In addition,
Germany carried out online forums with Australia,
Singapore, Japan and other countries based on the
Policy Guidelines for the Indo-Pacific Region between
November and December 2020, and proposed the
strengthening of presence in the Indo-Pacific, and the
enhancement of cooperation in the maritime, cyber and
equipment domains. Furthermore, setting up the goal
of a rules-based order, Germany announced the plan
to send a frigate to the Indo-Pacific in the near future.
Attention will be paid to Germany’s moves in relation to
its involvement in the region going forward.

**4 Canada**


**Chapter**


While Germany has been implementing a large-scale
reduction of its military personnel since the end of the
Cold War, it has been gradually expanding the dispatch
of its federal forces overseas. At the same time, Germany
has advanced the reform of its armed forces to enable
them to execute multiple responsibilities encompassing
conflict prevention and risk management in the context of
multilateral organizations, including NATO, the EU, and
the UN However following a worsening in the security


Canada promoted a significant reduction in defense
spending after the end of the Cold War, partly due to
financial challenges In doing so the number of active


-----

personnel was reduced from approximately 89,000 at
most to 60,000 or less, while the number of personnel
in operational forces required for dealing with newly
emerged security issues such as civil conflicts abroad
and international terrorism was on the rise. In response
to these situations, Canada concluded that the “peace
dividend” slogan in the aftermath of the end of the cold
war had been short-lived, and increased the defense
spending for a certain period and the number of military
personnel from 2000.
In June 2017, the Department of National Defence of
Canada released the National Defence Policy for the first
time in about nine years. In this policy, Canada mentions
that the United States is “still unquestionably the only
superpower,” while also stating the view that a degree of
major power competition has returned among China with
“increasing ability to project influence globally,” and
Russia with “its willingness to test” the current security
environment, which is causing the growing importance
for re-emergence of deterrence. In accordance with this
understanding of the security environment, Canada
places importance on its own national land and the
North American region on the basis of the national
defense policy. Based on the idea that global security
has a direct connection with Canadian defense, Canada
positions active international contribution as a basis of
the national defense policy. In terms of the building-up of
defense capability, the Canadian defense policy focuses
on the fields of space and cyberspace, intelligence, and
remote control systems. It also states plans to increase
the national defense budget, which once declined in
the 2010s, by more than 70% in 10 years, and the
Regular Force by 3,500 (to 71,500) military personnel.
Furthermore, Canada released the Arctic and Northern
Policy Framework in September 2019, setting up an
objective to enhance Canada’s military presence, based
on the recognition that strategic, military, and economic
importance of the region is increasing.
Canada regards the United States as its most
important ally and conducts air defense, space defense,
and maritime patrolling and monitoring activities in
North America jointly with the United States through
the North American Aerospace Defense Command
(NORAD). As a founding member, Canada also places

an importance on its relationship with NATO, and has
been actively participating in NATO-led operations in
Central and Eastern Europe and Afghanistan. In addition,
as a member of the Five Eyes (FVEY), an intelligencesharing alliance, Canada receives a great deal of benefits
and intends to continue deepening the relation with it.
Canada traditionally supports the activities of the United
Nations, and the Trudeau administration expresses its
stance of re-emphasizing the contribution to the UN
Peacekeeping Operations (PKO).
With regard to the Asia-Pacific region, Canada, in the
above mentioned National Defence Policy, positions itself
as a Pacific nation and shows the intention to engage in the
region through strategic dialogues to exchange views on
regional security issues, such as territorial disputes and the
situation in the Korean Peninsula. According to the Policy,
this also includes “a continued presence in the region
through high-level visits and participation in regional
exercises,” and working in cooperation with the United
States, Australia and New Zealand on the regional security
issues. Canada intends to seek stronger relationships with
other countries in the region, particularly China, and
also strives to strengthen the relationship with ASEAN
countries. Since April 2018, as part of these engagements
in the region, Canada has conducted surveillance activities
against illicit maritime activities, including ship-to-ship
transfers with North Korean vessels.[4] Canada’s moves
regarding the involvement in this region will continue to
attract attention.

Initially, the Canadian Armed Forces were engaged in the implementation activity of the sanctions imposed against North Korea as part of the “Operation PROJECTION,” a maritime operation for global
security and stability. In June 2019, Canada newly launched “Operation NEON” as an operation in the Asia-Pacific region and its armed forces have been engaging in the implementation activity within

U.S. and EU’s nuclear-related sanctions.[1] On January with the aim of giving maximum pressure to it. In addition,
16, 2016, the IAEA released a report confirming Iran’s the United States proposed at the UN Security Council

Iran. In addition, the EU terminated some of its sanctions, Russia and China were opposed to this proposition, and
and the provisions imposed by previous UN Security no support came from the United Kingdom, France, and
Council resolutions concerning the nuclear issues of Germany, and therefore it was rejected.

1 The major nuclear-related restrictions on Iran in the JCPOA include the following: with regard to uranium enrichment, limiting the number of centrifuges for uranium enrichment to 5,060 or less,
keeping the level of uranium enrichment at up to 3.67%, and restricting Iran’s enriched uranium stockpile to 300 kg; and with regard to plutonium production, redesigning and rebuilding the Arak
heavy water reactor to not produce weapons grade plutonium, and shipping spent fuel out of Iran, and not engaging in reprocessing spent fuel including R&D and not constructing reprocessing
facilities. According to then U.S. Secretary of State Kerry, with this agreement, Iran’s breakout time (the time it takes to accumulate the amount of fissile material needed for a single nuclear weapon)
will be extended from 90 days or less before the JCPOA to a year or more. Furthermore, the JCPOA is an agreement pertaining to nuclear issues and does not suspend or lift sanctions related to
international terrorism, missiles, human rights, among other issues.

2 The sanctions include a ban on the Iranian Government’s purchases of U.S. dollars, a prohibition on purchases of oil, petroleum products and petrochemical products from Iran, and a ban on
transactions with Iranian financial institutions, including the central bank. In May 2019, Significant Reduction Exceptions, which relate to a ban on some countries and regions’ purchase of Iranian oil,

Meanwhile, Iran opposed the resumption of sanctions
by the United States and announced that while it would
not withdraw from JCPOA after May 2019, it would
suspend its compliance with JCPOA step by step. In
January 2020, as the final step of reducing compliance
with JCPOA, Iran announced that it would waive
its commitment to the restrictions on enrichment
capacity. The U.K., France and Germany referred the
developments to the JCPOA Joint Commission under
the JCPOA Dispute Resolution Mechanism and called
for Iran to once again fully fulfill its obligations under
JCPOA. In response, Iran said that it would consider
withdrawing from the NPT if the nuclear agreement
issue is referred to the UN Security Council, and that
if Europe observes the agreement, Iran would return to
compliance with the agreement.
In this situation, incidents caused damage to buildings
and parties related to nuclear development within Iran.
For example, in July 2020, a fire broke out and an
explosion hit nuclear-related facilities located in Natanz,
damaging a part of equipment associated with centrifuge
assembly. In November of the same year, a scientist seen
as the central figure of the nuclear development in Iran
was attacked and killed in Iran. Iran blamed Israel for its
involvement in the incidents, but Israel has not made any
clear statements regarding its involvement. In December
2020, Iran’s parliament passed the law that requires the
Government of Iran and the Atomic Energy Organization
of Iran to expand the country’s uranium enrichment
activity. In January 2021, the Iranian Government
announced that it had started the process of producing
20% enriched uranium at Fordo Facility in southern
Teheran. The Iranian Government then made its stance
clear once again that Iran would return to compliance
with the agreement if the relevant countries were to
comply with the obligations based on the JCPOA and the
sanctions against Iran were to be lifted.
U.S. President Joe Biden, inaugurated in January
2021, showed his stance saying, “if Iran returns to strict
compliance with the nuclear deal, the United States
would rejoin the agreement as a starting point for followon negotiations.” In April 2021, the United States and
Iran launched indirect talks on the Iran nuclear deal.
After the start of the discussion, an explosion at the
nuclear-related facility in Natanz occurred, but after a
few days, the Iranian Government announced the plan
to start the process of producing 60% enriched uranium
at Natanz facility.

**Chapter**


**2 Military Trends in the Gulf Region**

While the situations surrounding the JCPOA were
changing, various events including military moves have
occurred in the Gulf region. Since May 2019, the United
States has announced the dispatch of carrier strike groups
and bomber units in response to Iran’s threats to its own
troops and interests. In June, Iran announced that it had
shot down a U.S. drone with a surface-to-air missile in
its territorial waters in the Strait of Hormuz. The U.S.
acknowledged the fact that it was shot down, but claimed
it was in international airspace, and revealed that then
President Trump had called off the retaliatory attack at the
brink of execution. In July 2019, the U.S. revealed that a
U.S. amphibious assault ship had shot down an Iranian
drone over the Strait of Hormuz as a defensive measure.
Furthermore, in May 2019, an oil pipeline facility in
central Saudi Arabia was attacked by drones, temporarily
halting the transportation of crude oil. In September,
an oil facility in eastern Saudi Arabia was attacked,
temporarily halving the country’s oil production. The
Houthis, a Yemeni anti-government armed group
allegedly supported by Iran, initially issued a statement
of responsibility for these attacks, but the United States
and others have pointed to Iranian involvement in the
September attacks. Iran has consistently denied this.
In response to this situation, the United States has
expanded the number of U.S. troops deployed to part of
the Middle East since May 2019 to reinforce its stance
against Iran. For example, in July, it stationed troops in
Saudi Arabia for the first time in nearly 16 years since
2003. In September and October, it announced the
deployment of additional troops, including air defense
missile forces.
In April 2020, an incident occurred in which a ship
of the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps made an
abnormally close approach to a U.S. Forces’ ship in
the Persian Gulf. The United States strongly criticized
Iran for the dangerous act and the National GeospatialIntelligence Agency advised that if an armed ship


-----

approached within 100 meters of a U.S. Navy vessel,
then such a ship could be interpreted as a threat and be
subject to lawful defensive measures. In the same month,
the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps launched a
military satellite for the first time. In response, the United
States denied the conventional Iranian claims that space
development was conducted for peaceful purposes due to
the potential military use of satellite launch technology
for ballistic missiles. Furthermore, in July 2020, an
Iranian airliner approached a U.S. fighter aircraft over
Syria and several passengers were injured. The United
States claimed that it had conducted a standard visual
inspection of the airliner at a safe distance, while Iran
accused the United States of having conducted acts
illegal under international law.
On the other hand, since October 2019, there have
been multiple attacks on U.S. military bases in Iraq.
In December, a rocket landed on a base in northern
Iraq, killing one American. The U.S. claimed Iranian
involvement in the attack and bombed the stronghold of
Kata’ib Hezbollah, one of the four Shiite[3] armed groups
allegedly supported by Iran. In addition, in January
2020, the United States killed Soleimani, commander of
the Quds Force of Iran’s Islamic Revolutionary Guard
Corps (IRGC), who was operating inside Iraq with the
organization’s leaders, as a deterrent to further attack
plans. The United States has long viewed the activities
of the Quds Force as problematic for supporting terrorist
organizations abroad. In April 2019, it designated the
IRGC as a terrorist organization. Iran carried out a
ballistic missile attack on Iraqi bases hosting U.S.
military in retaliation for the killing of Commander
Soleimani. However, the attack reportedly did not
result in any deaths, and Iranian Foreign Minister
Zarif expressed that Iran had completed commensurate
retaliatory measures and did not want further tensions
or war. Then President Trump also said the same day
that he did not want to use military force against Iran.
Both the United States and Iran made it clear that they
wanted to avoid any further escalation.
However, incidents targeting U.S. interests in Iraq
continued to occur, and two American military personnel
were killed by a rocket attack on the U.S. Forces base
in March 2020. In order to stop further attacks, the U.S.
Forces carried out air strikes against the stronghold of
Kata’ib Hezbollah again. Amid such a situation, in June
the same year, the Strategic Dialogue between the United
States and Iraq was held. In the dialogue, the Government
of Iraq reaffirmed its commitment to protecting the


military personnel of the International Coalition against
ISIL, including the U.S. Forces stationed in the country,
and the Iraqi facilities hosting them, and the two
countries agreed to advance the discussion of reducing
the U.S. Forces in Iraq. In September 2020, the number
of military personnel of the U.S. Forces stationed in Iraq
was reduced from 5,200 personnel to 3,000 personnel,
which was further reduced to 2,500 by January 2021.
Despite these efforts by the U.S. and Iraq governments,
similar attacks still continued to occur. In response to the
incident involving the injury of one American soldier
in February 2021 after the inauguration of the Biden
administration, the United States conducted an air strike
against a facility in eastern Syria, which is believed to
have been used by Iran-backed militia groups including
Kata’ib Hezbollah.

**3 Maritime Security in the Gulf Region**


**Chapter**


Since May 2019, events affecting the navigation safety of
civilian vessels have occurred sporadically in the waters
of the Middle East. Specifically, in May 2019, four tankers
(two Saudi Arabia-flagged and one each from the United
Arab Emirates and Norway) were attacked in the Gulf
of Oman. In June, two vessels, including the chemical
tanker Kokuka Courageous operated by a Japanese
shipping company, were attacked in the Gulf of Oman.
With regard to the series of attacks, the United States
and others have pointed out that they were committed by
Iran, while Iran has consistently denied any involvement.
Based on a comprehensive review of the information
on the attack on the Kokuka Courageous, technical
analysis of the damage to the vessel, and testimony from
the parties concerned, Japan believes that the damage
to the vessel is highly likely to have been caused by
limpet mines.[4] Furthermore, in January 2021, explosives,
believed to be limpet mines, were found to be installed
in a Liberia-flagged tanker located off the coast of Iraq
and were eliminated by the Iraq military authority. With
no one claiming responsibility for that incident, the Iraqi
authority has been conducting an investigation into it. In
February 2021, it was reported that a cargo ship owned
by an Israeli company exploded while sailing through the
Gulf of Oman, which damaged the hull of the ship. Israel
suggested Iran’s involvement in the incident, but Iran
has denied it. In March and April, other explosion and
attack incidents involving Iran- and Israel-related ships
occurred one after another.
Amidst rising tensions in the Middle East, countries


One of the two major sects of Islam. The division with the Sunnis originated in differences in views on the successors (caliph) to the Prophet Muhammad (died in 632), the founder of Islam. At present,
Shia Islam is the state religion in Iran, and Shiites make up about 60 percent of the population in Iraq. The largest sect, the Sunnis, have a majority in most of the Muslim countries in the Middle East
and North Africa region.

continue carrying out efforts to safeguard maritime
security in the region. The United States proposed the
Maritime Security Initiative in July 2019 and established
the International Maritime Security Construct (IMSC)
with its command center opened in Bahrain in November.
In addition to the United States, IMSC has been joined
by seven countries, including the United Kingdom,
Saudi Arabia, the UAE, Bahrain, Albania, Lithuania, and
Estonia (as of March 2021). In Europe, eight countries
(France, the Netherlands, Denmark, Greece, Belgium,
Germany, Italy and Portugal) issued a statement in
January 2020 to politically support the creation of the
European Maritime Awareness in the Strait of Hormuz
(EMASOH) mission. France, the Netherlands, Denmark,
Belgium, and Greece have dispatched their assets so far.

Since the foundation of Israel in 1948, there have been four

wars between Israel and Arab countries. Subsequently,
the Oslo Accords, signed between Israel and Palestine in
1993, initiated a full-fledged, negotiated peace process.
In 2003, both Israel and Palestine accepted the Roadmap
for Peace that laid out a path to the realization of the
two-state peace initiative based on peaceful coexistence,
but it has not been implemented. In the Palestinian
territories, the moderate Fatah, which governs the West
Bank of the Jordan River, and the Islamic fundamentalist
Hamas, which effectively controls the Gaza district, are
in conflict, splitting the area.
In such circumstances, the then U.S. Trump
administration announced its recognition of Jerusalem
as the capital of Israel in December 2017 and moved
the U.S. embassy from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem in May
2018. In reaction, protests have been repeated mainly
in Gaza, with protesters killed and injured through their
clashes with Israeli forces. Tensions have increased
intermittently as Israel carried out air strikes on Gaza to
counter rocket attacks from Gaza. In addition, in March
2019, the then Trump administration recognized Israeli
sovereignty over the Golan Heights, drawing criticism
from various Middle Eastern countries. In January 2020,
the administration announced a new Middle East peace
plan, but the Palestinian side has refused to negotiate,
opposing the plan’s descriptions concerning the IsraeliPalestinian border and the possession of Jerusalem.
Meanwhile, the then Trump administration actively
encouraged Israel and Arab countries to realize a peace
agreement. In recent years, moves for developing relations
between Israel and some Arab countries had been reported.

effort in and after August 2020 the UAE Bahrain


On the other hand, in September 2019, Iran presented
a plan named HOPE (Hormuz Peace Endeavor) as an
independent effort to maintain security in the Persian
Gulf and the Strait of Hormuz, and called on the countries
concerned to join. In December, Iran also conducted the
Maritime Safety Belt, the first trilateral military exercise
with the Chinese and Russian navies in the Gulf of Oman
and other areas to ensure the safety of maritime traffic
routes. In addition, in February 2021, Iran and Russia
carried out a bilateral military exercise, “Maritime
Security Belt,” in the northern Indian Ocean.
Japan needs to continue to pay close attention to the
future developments surrounding the situation in the
Gulf region.

Sudan, and Morocco successively reached agreements
for the normalization of diplomatic relations with Israel.
The establishment of diplomatic relations between Arab
countries and Israel was the first such event since Egypt
(1979) and Jordan (1994). At the signing ceremony for the
agreement for the normalization of diplomatic relations in
September 2020, when the representatives of Israel, the
UAE and Bahrain gathered together in the White House,
President Trump described the significance of the deal,
saying, “After decades of division and conflict, we mark
the dawn of a new Middle East.” On the other hand, U.S.
Secretary of State Pompeo suggested the aspect of these
agreements as pressure on Iran, stating that the agreement
demonstrated weakening regional influences of Iran and
its deepening isolation.
Israel intends to promote cooperation with the UAE
and Bahrain in establishing embassies and launching
direct flights, and also in a wide range of fields including
economy and technology. In fact, Israel opened its
embassy in the capital Abu Dhabi of the UAE in January
2021, and the UAE ambassador arrived in Israel in
March. Furthermore, Israel, along with the normalization
of diplomatic relations with the UAE, changed its
previous stance. For example, Israel temporarily
suspended applying its sovereignty to the West Bank,
and announced that it would not oppose the U.S.’s sale
of F-35 fighter jets, which are owned only by Israel in
the Middle East, to the UAE, as long as Israel’s military
superiority is maintained.
Palestinian factions opposed these moves towards
the normalization of diplomatic relations, viewing them
as a betrayal of the cause of Palestine, and this led to
protests across Palestine. Meanwhile, in September
2020 the Fatah and Hamas showed some positive moves

towards a compromise, in that they agreed to implement
a vision for ending the conflict and the presidential and
legislative elections for the Palestinian Authority, which
was last held in 2006. In and after October 2017, the
Fatah and Hamas continued direct negotiations on the
transfer of the administrative control of the Gaza Strip
to the Fatah under Egyptian auspices, but the talks had
remained stalled.
Amid the changing situations surrounding the MiddleEast peace process, a close eye will be kept on future
developments regarding the Middle East peace process,
including the United States’ engagement, as well as
the direction of negotiations on the transfer of the
administrative control of the Gaza Strip.

Violent clashes in Syria since March 2011 pit four parties,

the Syrian Government forces, opposition forces, Islamic
extremist forces, and Kurdish groups, against each other.
However, the government forces have gained the upper
hand overall with support from Russia, recapturing
Aleppo, which was once the largest stronghold of rebel
forces, the suburbs of the Syrian capital of Damascus and
areas close to the Syria-Jordan border.
In Idlib, a rebel stronghold even today, Russia,
which had been supporting Syrian Government forces,
and Turkey, which had been backing the rebels, agreed
in September 2018 to establish a DMZ in Idlib and
withdraw heavy artillery and militant groups from the
zone. However, there was no progress with regard to
the withdrawal of the militant groups. Since April
2019, Syrian Government forces and Russian forces
had expanded air and ground operations into Idlib
and besieged some of the Turkish military ceasefire
monitoring stations set up around Idlib. In February
2020, the Turkish forces dispatched reinforcements
to Idlib in response to the advance of the Syrian
Government forces, but the forces were shelled by the
Syrian Government forces, against which the Turkish
forces retaliated, reportedly causing casualties on both
sides. Subsequently, the fighting between the Turkish
forces and the Syrian Government forces expanded. The
Syrian Government forces were faced with intensified
resistance from the dissidents and the militants, who
were reinforced by the Turkish forces. The forces and
militants fought back and forth over the key points
of traffic through Idlib. In March 2020, Turkey held a
summit meeting with Russia, which had been backing
Syria, and agreed to a ceasefire in Idlib. However, even
after the agreement, battles have occurred intermittently
and a complete ceasefire has not been realized

Israel and the UAE/Bahrain (At the White House) [U.S. Department of State]

Meanwhile, the peace talks have so far made little
progress. Since January 2016, there have been talks
between the government and opposition forces under
UN auspices. However, the fighting between both
sides did not abate, disrupting the talks. Under the
circumstances, peace talks led by Russia, Turkey, and
Iran have continued in Astana (current Nur-Sultan),
Kazakhstan, since January 2017. In January 2018, the
Syrian National Dialogue Congress was held in Sochi,
Russia, where an agreement was reached to establish a
constitutional committee towards the enactment of a new
constitution. In December 2018, Russia, Iran and Turkey
agreed to hold the first meeting of the committee as early
as possible in 2019. The first meeting was held in October
2019 under the auspices of the UN, but to date there has
been no substantive progress in the political process.
In addition, conflicts among the countries and forces
involved over the Kurds inside Syria have surfaced. In
October 2019, following a summit telephone talk with
Turkey, the United States issued a statement that Turkey
would soon begin an operation in the northern part of
Syria and that U.S. forces would withdraw from the
immediate area of operation. After the release of the
statement, Turkey launched a military operation against
Kurdish groups, which the country perceives as terrorist
organizations, as well as ISIL, in order to eliminate the
terrorist threat from the border zone with Syria and
establish a “safe zone” that would enable the return
of Syrian refugees inside Turkey, and took control of
parts of the northeastern region of Syria. Subsequently,
Turkey and the United States agreed on the suspension of
military operations and the withdrawal of Kurdish groups
from the “safe zone.” Turkey also held talks with Russia,
and agreed on the withdrawal of Kurdish groups from
the border zone and joint patrols by Russian military

police and Turkish forces in northeastern Syria. Over
these developments, Russia’s growing military presence
has been noted, including the reported deployment
of a helicopter unit at the airport in the northeastern
Syrian city of Qamishli as part of the patrol operation.
Furthermore, the Syrian Government agreed with the
Kurdish groups to send the Syrian Government troops to
the northeast, advancing into Manbij, one of the Kurdish
groups’ strongholds, which indicates coordination
between the Kurdish groups and the Syrian Government
to counter Turkey’s military operations. The agreement
was allegedly mediated by Russia, suggesting that
Russia’s influence is expanding. It has also been pointed
out that in the wake of Turkey’s military operations,
counterterrorism activities by Kurdish groups, which
has played a central role in the fight against ISIL, were
suspended, and some ISIL fighters and their families fled
from camps controlled by Kurdish groups.
Moreover, concerning Iranian presence in Syria,
confrontation between Iran and Israel has come to the
surface. In January 2019, Israeli Prime Minister Netanyahu
announced an attack on a weapon storage facility at

In Yemen, following anti-government protests that

**5** **Situation in Yemen**

occurred from February 2011 and international pressure
afterward, then President Ali Abdullah Saleh agreed to
resign in accordance with the Gulf Cooperation Council
(GCC) initiative. Through the election held in February
2012, then Vice President Abd-Rabbu Mansour Hadi was
elected as the new President.
Meanwhile, the confrontation intensified between the
government and the opposition insurgent group Houthis,
based in northern Yemen. As the Houthis invaded the
Yemeni capital of Sana and the southern Yemeni city of
Aden, to which President Hadi evacuated, the President
requested support from Arab countries. In response, in
March 2015, coalition forces led by Saudi Arabia began
air strikes against the Houthis. In response, the Houthis
also launched attacks on the mainland of Saudi Arabia
with ballistic missiles and other weapons.
A series of peace talks mediated by the UN took place
between April and August of the same year, but no final
peace agreement was reached, with the talks suspended.
Peace talks were planned for September 2018 but failed to
be implemented with the Houthis refusing to participate.
In December 2018, however, peace talks were held in
Stockholm, the capital of Sweden, leading to the signing
of an agreement on a ceasefire in Hodeidah, which has the
biggest port in the country, and the exchange of prisoners.
In January 2019 the UN Security Council decided to


Syria’s Damascus Airport, expressing his determination
to take resolute actions against the Iranians in Syria. Due
to the repeated attacks believed to be conducted by Israel
targeting Iranian forces in Syria, there are concerns that
the escalation of confrontation between Israel and Iran
would affect Syrian and regional stability.
Amid the still unstable situation in Syria, the United
States continues to have some of its troops stationed in
the country to mop up ISIL. In September 2020, the U.S.
Forces announced that it had dispatched mechanized
infantry forces stationed in Kuwait to eastern Syria to
show its intention to protect the Coalition of the Willing
Forces. In Eastern Syria, obstructive acts have been
sporadically occurring between the U.S. Forces and
the Armed Forces of Russia. In the month before the
announcement regarding the U.S. Forces dispatch, an
accident occurred in which a Russian military vehicle
collided with a U.S. military vehicle and caused injuries.
Relations between various forces over the Syrian
situation have been complicated, with peace talks
being stalled. Further initiatives from the international
community towards the stabilization of Syria are required.

send a ceasefire monitoring group to Hodeidah.
Despite the progress in the peace talks, negotiations
on specific measures toward the ceasefire did not go
smoothly, with the terms of the agreement, including the
ceasefire in Hodeidah, failing to be implemented. On the
other hand, the Houthis, stating that they had carried out
attacks against Saudi Arabia, including an attack on an
oil facility in Saudi Aramco in September 2019, declared
in September 2019 that they would cease attacks on the
country on the condition that the coalition forces ceased
its air strikes. Also, in November 2019, as there were
reports that Saudi Arabia and the Houthis were engaged in
negotiations behind the scenes, Saudi Arabia announced
that it had released 200 Houthi prisoners of war. In
addition, in the same month, the UN Special Envoy for
Yemen reported that airstrikes by the coalition forces
had decreased significantly. Despite the momentum for a
ceasefire, Saudi Arabia carried out air strikes against the
Houthis after a missile launched by the Houthis landed
on a Yemeni Government’s military base and killed
more than 100 soldiers in January 2020. In retaliation,
the Houthis announced that they had carried out drone
and missile strikes against oil facilities in southern Saudi
Arabia. Since then, there have been sporadic attacks on
Saudi Arabia by the Houthis, and the Saudi-led coalition
has also continued to bomb the Houthis. In November
2020 the Houthis attacked an oil facility in western Saudi

Arabia and caused a fire. The Houthis also continue to
fight with the Yemeni Government’s military, and battles
are intensifying particularly in Hodeidah and Marib,
areas rich in natural resources.
In addition, it has been pointed out that the Houthis
receive weapons supplies from Iran.[5] In fact, in February
2020, the U.S. forces announced that it had boarded and
inspected a small vessel in the Arabian Sea and seized
a large amount of weapons from the vessel. The U.S.
forces affirmed that the seized weapons were made in
Iran, concluding that they were intended to be supplied to
the Houthis in Yemen, and pointing to them as a violation
of the UN Security Council resolution prohibiting the
supply, sale and transfer of weapons to the Houthis.
While the situation surrounding the Houthis was
changing, in August 2019, fighting broke out between
the Yemeni Government and the Southern Transitional
Council (STC), a separatist group in southern Yemen,
which led to the STC’s occupation of Aden (Yemen’s
interim capital). However, after mediation efforts by

In Libya, following the collapse of the Gaddafi regime

**6** **Situation in Libya**

in 2011, elections for a General National Congress were
held in July 2012, establishing a congress consisting
mainly of Islamists. In June 2014, elections for a Council
of Representatives were held to establish a new congress
to replace the General National Congress. However,
since secularists became the majority, the confrontation
between Islamic and secular groups over the transfer
of power to the Council of Representatives intensified,
and consequently, Libya became fragmented between
east and west, with two assemblies existing in parallel
– the Islamic groups’ General National Congress based
in the capital city of Tripoli and the secular groups’
Council of Representatives based in Tobruk in eastern
Libya. In December 2015, the UN mediated a political
agreement for Libya, and the Government of National
Accord (GNA) was established as a national consensus
government under the agreement. However, as Islamic
groups took control of the new government, secular
groups turned their backs and refused to join the GNA.
As a result, Libya remains divided between the east and
the west. Furthermore, militias supporting either the east
or the west have continued sporadic military clashes.
In September 2018, militias active in the west clashed,
leading to an emergency declaration. In April 2019,
Commander Hafter’s LNA, the largest forces in eastern


Saudi Arabia and others, the Yemeni Government and
STC signed the Riyadh Agreement in Riyadh, the capital
of Saudi Arabia, in November 2019. The agreement
established a new government with the participation
of both sides. While the confrontations between both
sides continued and the Riyadh Agreement remained
unfulfilled, in December 2020, Yemen’s new cabinet was
established based on the agreement. Despite this progress,
an attack, believed to have targeted the ministers of
the new cabinet, occurred at the airport in the southern
Yemeni city of Aden in the same month, in which many
people were killed and wounded. The Government of
Yemen treated this attack as an act of terrorism by the
Houthis and denounced it.
The Biden administration of the United States has set
out a policy of strengthening diplomacy to end the war in
Yemen and completely ending its support for offensive
operations in the country. However, with the Houthis
intensifying their offensive, there is no prospect of a
ceasefire or eventual peace agreement across Yemen.

Libya, advanced into a suburb of the capital city of
Tripoli and clashed with militias subordinate to the GNA
in western Libya, leading to an exchange of air strikes.
Some pointed out that the fact that both eastern
and western forces received military support from the
countries involved, including Unmanned Aerial Vehicles
(UAVs), also led to the escalation of the war, and the
struggle between the two parties was described as a
“drone war.”[6] It has also been pointed out that mercenaries
from a Russian private military company have been
dispatched to Libya to support the LNA, while Turkey
has dispatched Turkish forces and the Syrian fighters it
has been supporting to Libya at the request of the GNA.
Amid this situation, an international conference on
Libya was held in Berlin in January 2020. The conference
was attended by western countries, including the United
States, the United Kingdom, France, and Turkey, as well
as the UAE and Egypt, which are said to be supporting
the LNA. The countries agreed to strengthen cooperation
toward a ceasefire, stop military intervention in Libya,
and enforce an arms embargo.
However, the battle continued even after the agreement
and the forces on the GNA side, which received additional
support from Turkey, intensified its counterattack. As
a result, in June 2020, the GNA announced that it had
regained control of the whole area of Tripoli. Afterwards,

the interim Government of National Unity was approved

mass organization working for the “revival of Islam,”
took office. However, in June 2013, large-scale public
protests occurred amidst the poor economic situation
and the deterioration of security. The military intervened
in response and dismissed the president. In May

Furthermore, ISIL, Al Qaeda, and other terrorist
organizations are taking advantage of the unstable
situation to expand into Libya, clashing with militias
across the country. In particular, ISIL is believed to have
been divided into small groups and hiding mainly in the
southern desert areas, conducting suicide bombing and
other terrorist attacks in such cities as Tripoli, the capital,
indicating that terrorist attacks may continue in the future.

the abolition of subsidies. However, enhancing domestic
security measures is still a major challenge. In particular,
the country’s mainland was subject to sporadic largescale terrorist attacks from 2013, when political turmoil
took place, to 2017, and in November 2018, a terrorist
attack occurred in the central part of the country, targeting
Egypt’s minority Coptic Christians. Moreover, in the
Sinai Peninsula, terrorist attacks on military and police
forces have occurred sporadically mainly in the northern
part, while the southern part is overall peaceful. Since
February 2018, a counter-terrorism operation conducted
by the Egyptian Armed Forces has been underway in the
northern part of the Sinai Peninsula.

**8** **Situation in Afghanistan**

NATO-led Resolute Support Mission (RSM) launched
education, training and advice for the Afghan National
Defense and Security Forces (ANDSF) in the wake of
ISAF’s withdrawal in December 2014. Meanwhile, the
ANDSF faces challenges regarding logistics, morale,
air capabilities, and troop-commander leadership,
allowing the Taliban to expand its control in Afghanistan.
Furthermore, Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant –
Khorasan Province (ISIL–KP) has sustained terrorist
attacks mainly in the capital city of Kabul and eastern
Afghanistan since 2015. As a result, suicide bombing
and assaults in which the Taliban or ISIL is believed to
be involved have occurred one after another across the
country, leaving Afghanistan in an unstable security
situation. According to a report released by the U.S.
Special Inspector General for Afghanistan Reconstruction
(SIGAR) in October 2018, the areas controlled or
influenced by the Afghan Government accounted for
approximately 55.5% of Afghan territory, the lowest
since December 2015, when the survey started.
Since the fall of 2018 the United States has


conducted peace talks with the Taliban after appointing
Khalilzad as the Special Representative for Afghanistan
Reconciliation. The talks had some twists and turns,
including a three-month suspension from September
2019, but in February 2020, an agreement was signed
between the United States and the Taliban that included
the conditional phase-out of U.S. forces in Afghanistan
and the start of negotiations among Afghans. In March
2020, the United States announced that it had begun the
withdrawal of its forces. Also in the same month, the
UN Security Council unanimously adopted a resolution
in support of the agreement. In accordance with the
agreement, a mutual release of prisoners and captives
was realized between the Afghan Government and
the Taliban as confidence-building measures, and in
September 2020, the peace talks between the Afghan
Government and the Taliban began in Qatar. However,
the Taliban have continued their attacks on Afghan
security forces and violent acts are intensifying in some
areas. The United States had reduced the size of the U.S.
Forces in Afghanistan to 2,500 personnel by January
2021 and President Biden announced in April the

Abdullah accused Ghani of fraud in the election and held
his own presidential inauguration ceremony, causing
political turmoil. In May 2020, President Ghani and

The second North-South civil war in Sudan, which

**9** **Situation in South Sudan**

had continued since 1983, came to an end in 2005
with the entry into force of the Comprehensive Peace
Agreement (CPA) concluded between the Sudan People’s
Liberation Movement Army (SPLM/A), the predecessor
of the current administration in southern Sudan, which
later became the government army, and the al-Bashir
administration. In July 2011, the Republic of South
Sudan was separated and gained independence from the
Republic of the Sudan following the referendum based
on the CPA.
However, the conflicts within the SPLA, which had
existed since the independence, continued. By the time
when the current transitional government was established
in 2020, two large-scale armed confrontations occurred
due to political conflicts between President Salve Kiir,
representing the largest power of the Dinka, and First
Vice President Riek Machar, who represents the second
largest power of the Nuer.
The first confrontation occurred in the capital Juba
in December 2013. Through the mediation of the
Intergovernmental Authority on Development (IGAD)
with the support by the United Nations and the AU, the
government side and the pro-Machar faction signed the
peace agreement, the Agreement on the Resolution of
the Conflict in South Sudan (ARCSS) in August 2015.
Based on the Agreement, the Transitional Government
of National Unity was established, with Mr. Kiir serving
as president and Mr. Machar as first vice president, in
April 2016.
However, in July 2016, three months after the
establishment of transitional government, the second
armed conflict occurred between the security forces

of President Kiir and First Vice President Machar.
After First Vice President Machar fled the country, and
President Kiir dismissed First Vice President Machar,
clashes started to occur again between the government
and the Machar faction.
Given this situation, the IGAD held the High-Level
Revitalization Forum in June 2017 in an attempt
to revitalize the ARCSS. In June 2018, President
Kiir, former First Vice President Machar and others
adopted the “Khartoum Declaration of Agreement on
South Sudan,” which includes a permanent ceasefire.
They agreed on security arrangements in July and on
transitional government arrangements in August, before
officially signing the “Revitalized Agreement on the
Resolution of the Conflict in South Sudan (R-ARCSS)”
in September 2018.
Initially, the transitional government was scheduled
to be established in May 2019, but it was finally
realized in February 2020 after two extensions of the
pre-transitional period. The R-ARCSS expects to hold a
presidential election in March 2022, and the inauguration
of the formal government in South Sudan in May of the
same year, while the implementation of the R-ARCSS,
including the formation of a unified military force and
other matters, tends to be delayed. On the other hand,
in December 2020, both the government and opposition
forces agreed to establish the provisional parliament and
local governments. Attention will be paid to the moves
towards the inauguration of the formal government
going forward.

Somalia has faced two major issues — terrorism and
piracy. Al-Shabaab, a Sunni extremist organization based
in the central south, has repeatedly conducted terrorist
attacks against the Government and other targets. In 2007,
the African Union Mission in Somalia (AMISOM) was
established with the approval of the UN Security Council.
As a result of attacks by the AMISOM forces and mopup operations by the Somali Government forces under
reconstruction with support from Western countries, AlShabaab lost its control on major cities and weakened
to some extent. However, its threat has still existed. AlShabaab frequently stages attacks against the bases of the
Somali and AMISOM forces and terrorist attacks within
Somalia and in AMISOM member countries. It has been
pointed out that ISIL fighters have been flowing into
Somalia in recent years.
Furthermore, in December 2020, the United States
announced the withdrawal of most of the U.S. troops from
Somalia and their relocation to other bases in East Africa.
In the same month, the Somali Government announced
that it had severed diplomatic ties with Kenya, which


had been cooperating with Somalia in counterterrorism
operations. These moves indicate that the environment
surrounding counterterrorism is changing.
In Somalia, especially in its northeastern part, there are
believed to be outposts of pirates who are active off the
coast of Somalia and in the Gulf of Aden. The international
community has continued anti-piracy operations and
implemented a series of initiatives to enhance the security
capabilities of Somalia based on the perception that
instability of Somalia has caused the piracy issue. As a
result, the numbers of reported pirate attacks for both 2019
and 2020 were both recorded as zero.
The parliamentary elections and presidential election,
which were expected to take place towards the end of
2020, were still nowhere in sight even after the term of
office of President Mohamed Abdullahi Mohamed (also
known by his nickname Farmajo) ended on February 8,
2021. We should keep paying close attention to whether
the situation in Somalia will start to stabilize, while also
looking at the international community’s response.

2025 and it is pointed out that China would also deploy
them by 2025.
The United States, China, and Russia are developing
high-power laser weapons to destroy targets with laser
energy. Laser weapons are expected as an effective and
less costly means to intercept attacks by multiple small
unmanned vehicles and boats. Though it depends on
the technological maturity, high-power laser weapons
would excel in the speed of response compared with
conventional weapons, and they can be free from
ammunition constraints. Therefore, laser weapons, if
strengthened enough to intercept missiles, would be able
to efficiently counter massive missile attacks.
The U.S. Air Force acquired an anti-UAV laser system
in 2019. The United States has also successfully tested a
30 kW ship-based solid laser weapon system (LaWS) to
counter small UAVs in the Persian Gulf in 2014. In a test
conducted in the Pacific Ocean in May 2020, the U.S.
Navy successfully neutralized a flying unmanned vehicle
with its shipboard high-powered laser demonstrator.
However, while the U.S. Air Force’s SHiELD program,
which aims to develop a laser weapon that can be installed
on fighters, had planned a flight test originally in 2021, it
was reported the test was postponed for two years due to
the COVID-19 pandemic.
China exhibited the 30-100 kW “Silent Hunter” laser
weapon system, capable of countering small UAVs, at the
IDEX 2017 international defense exhibition. It is pointed
out that China is developing higher-power laser weapon
systems to attack satellites.
Russia has deployed the 10 kW Peresvet laser weapon
system and it is reportedly developing a megawatt-class
chemical laser weapon system for attacking satellites.
High-power microwave technology can cause
destruction and malfunction in the electronic systems
responsible for such functions as intelligence-gathering
and command & communications aboard UAVs, missiles
and other airborne threats. The United States has acquired
the Phaser high-power microwave system in 2019. In a
U.S. Army drill, the system reportedly countered two to
three UAVs at one time and 33 UAVs in total.

capacity, among other areas.
The United States, China, and Russia have formulated
their AI strategies and promoted relevant research and
development under industry-government-academia
collaboration. The U.S. Department of Defense (DoD)
established the Joint Artificial Intelligence Center (JAIC)
in June 2018 and indicated its policy of using AI in a
lawful and ethical manner in “Summary of the 2018
Department of Defense Artificial Intelligence Strategy”
released in February 2019. The Chinese government
announced the “Next Generation AI Development Plan”
in 2017, setting a target for China to become a major
global AI innovation center by 2030. In Russia, President
Vladimir Putin in 2017 acknowledged that AI leaders
would rule the world. Its national AI development
strategy through 2030, released in October 2019,
cited such targets as the acceleration of AI technology
development, support for scientific research, and the
improvement of human resources development systems.
AI-using technologies being studied include situation
assessment support systems to display data collected
through various sensors in an easy-to-understand
manner, as well as decision-making support systems
to provide commanders with available options.
In December 2019, the United States conducted
demonstration tests on the Advanced Battle Management
System (ABMS), which analyzes collected data with AI
and promptly shares the analysis with combat troops
using networks. Meanwhile, China has announced that
an AI Military Simulation Competition was held by
the Central Military Commission in July 2020 with the
purpose of researching and developing next-generation
command information systems.
The United States, China, and Russia are developing
autonomous unmanned vehicles equipped with AI.
Autonomous unmanned vehicles would generally
combine unmanned vehicles technologies expected to
be utilized in dangerous, dirty, and dull missions with

**(1) AI Technology**
AI technology is one of the technology areas that
shows rapid progress in recent years. It has been
pointed out that the rapid AI progress has been exerting
a great impact on the military field, including the
application for autonomous unmanned vehicles and
the cyber domain as well as supporting for command
and decision-making and improving data processing

and battle situation changes, and enables intelligence,
surveillance and reconnaissance (ISR) missions in a
wide range of areas over a long time, without risking
human lives.
The U.S. Defense Advanced Research Projects
Agency (DARPA) is developing AI-equipped unmanned
aerial vehicles (UAVs), including swarms of reusable,
air-launched and air-recovered small UAVs for ISR
missions, as well as unmanned surface vessels for locating
submarines. Moreover, DARPA is also promoting R&D
of automated air-to-air combat, with AI winning in a
combat simulation against air force pilots.
In May 2018, the China Electronics Technology
Group Corporation successfully performed a swarm
flight of 200 AI-equipped unmanned vehicles, and
in September 2020, a Chinese state-owned munition
company publicly shared the status of the UAV swarm
test. It is assumed that military operations including
such swarm flights will be difficult to counter with
conventional air defense systems.
In September 2019, Russia conducted a coordinated
flight test between S-70 heavy unmanned combat aerial
vehicle “Okhotnik,” stealth heavy unmanned combat
aerial vehicle, and the fifth-generation fighter Su-57, and
released the flight test footage publicly.
Some have argued that autonomous unmanned
vehicles could develop into so-called Lethal Autonomous
Weapons Systems (LAWS). Within the framework of the
United Nations Convention on Certain Conventional
Weapons (CCW), discussion on LAWS is continued from
the perspectives of their characteristics, human elements,
and international law.

**(2) Quantum Technology**
Quantum technology is positioned as an important
technology which brings innovation to society
by applying quantum mechanics that differ from
familiar physics that people sense every day. For
example, quantum cryptographic communications
is a communication system which utilizes quantum
cryptographic technology taking advantage of quantum
characteristics, and reportedly cannot be deciphered by
third parties. It is pointed out that quantum radar may be
able to neutralize the stealth advantage of stealth aircraft
by utilizing quantum characteristics. It is pointed out that
quantum computers can compute problems in a short
amount of time and with less electricity consumption
than existing supercomputers and can also be applied to
areas such as decryption.
China has developed the world’s longest quantum
cryptographic communications network, extending over
approximately 3,000 km and connecting Beijing and
Shanghai In addition in August 2016 China launched


“Mozi,” the world’s first satellite to test quantum
cryptographic communications. In January 2018, China
said that it succeeded in using Mozi for long-distance
quantum cryptographic communication between China
and Austria. Positioning quantum computer development
as a key science and technology project, China has also
invested approximately 7 billion yuan in a national
laboratory for quantum information and technology and
other facilities.

**(3) Fifth-generation Mobile Communications System**
**(5G) Technology**

The fifth generation wireless mobile network system (5G)
has been gaining traction since commercial services were
launched in countries one after another in April 2019 as
a private mobile communications infrastructure. With
its advanced information communications technology,
5G technology brings provision of high-quality services
(high speed, low latency, large capacity, multiple and
simultaneous connection/high reliability, etc.) to reality
without showing signs of complex data processing.
In March 2020, the United States announced the
National Strategy to Secure 5G, and in May 2020, the
U.S. Department of Defense 5G Strategy was announced,
which indicates defense policy approaches of the
national strategy. The DoD’s strategy has indicated 5G
as an extremely important strategic technology and that
countries with proficient knowledge in cutting-edge
technology developed via this will gain economic and
military advantages. Moreover, it said that the protection
of the 5G network system of the U.S. military and its
allies and partners to ensure endurance and reliability
will be the core task of the DoD and indicated measures,
including those for allies and partners.
Australia has virtually excluded Huawei Technologies
Co., Ltd. from its national 5G endeavors, while the
company has not been able to partake in the national
5G business in New Zealand. The United Kingdom has
stated it will eliminate all Huawei products from its 5G
network by the end of 2027.

**(4) Additive Manufacturing Technology**
Additive manufacturing technology, as typified by
three-dimensional printing, can produce goods that are
too complex to be produced conventionally, at a much
lower cost. Given this, 3D printer technology can bring
revolutionary changes in logistics, such as not depending
on the stock when procuring parts, and nations point
out the military use of the technology. For example, the
U.S. Army noted that the technology could trigger a real
logistics revolution by making the transportation of spare
goods unnecessary, and the U.S. Air Force announced it
is manufacturing aviation engine parts that were pointed

countries[2] launched a four-year joint project to study
potential applications of 3D printer technology. The
Australian Navy is considering using 3D printers for

In recent years, the sophistication of military science and

technology, and the greater complexity of equipment
have caused a steep rise in equipment development and
production costs and have raised unit prices for equipment
procurement, while Western countries in particular have
continued to face difficulties in increasing defense
budgets significantly. Under these circumstances, many
countries are taking on a variety of initiatives in order to
maintain and enhance their national defense technological
and industrial bases.
Western countries have set a target to increase
competitiveness through the realignment of their defense
industry, in light of the aforementioned situation related
to national defense budgets. The United States has
experienced repeated mergers and integrations among
domestic corporations, while Europe has experienced
cross-border mergers and integrations of the defense
industry, especially in Germany, France, the United
Kingdom, and Italy. In response to the escalation of
development and production costs, Western countries
are promoting joint development and production of
equipment and technological cooperation among their
allies and partners. This move aims for (1) sharing
development and production costs, (2) expanding demand
in all countries participating in joint development and
production, (3) mutual complement of technologies, and
(4) raising domestic technology levels by obtaining stateof-the-art technology.
For example, the joint development and production
of the F-35 fighter jet led by the United States is the
largest joint program. At present, there is anticipated
demand for more than 3,300 aircraft.[3] This project will
have impacts on the defense technological and industrial
bases of the countries involved, through the operation,
sustainment and maintenance stages of the aircraft. The
European Union (EU) has created the European Defence
Fund (EDF)[4] to provide funding for joint research and
development by the EU member states in order to

private companies agreed in January 2020 to cooperate
in a 3D printer project for the armed forces.

promote their cooperation in developing and acquiring
defense equipment and facilitate the efficient production
of state-of-the-art and interoperable equipment.
There is an increasing number of cases where
governments provide funding for national defense-related
research and development conducted by the private
sector. In the United States, for example, approximately
US$3.566 billion in research and development funding
was requested for FY2021 for DARPA, whose mission
is to make investments in breakthrough technologies that
will contribute to national security. The U.S. defense
authority has long provided substantial funding for the
research conducted by companies and universities. In
some other countries, such as the United Kingdom and
Australia, responding to the recent utilization of dualuse technologies in defense equipment development,
the governments have launched initiatives to provide
funding for private sector research and development on
innovative technologies in order to acquire advanced
civilian technologies.[5]
Countries have exported equipment overseas since
the Cold War era, and still today, many countries are
taking measures to promote exports. While the United
States, Russia, European countries and China have
remained as leading defense equipment exporters,
countries such as the Republic of Korea (ROK) and
Turkey have been expanding exports of equipment,
which is an outcome of their success in developing the
equipment manufacturing bases owing to the imported
equipment in the past and improvement of capabilities
in science and technology.
Defense equipment imports by Asian and Oceanian
countries have continued an uptrend in recent years,
seemingly against the background of economic growth
in the region as well as the expansion of the influence of
China, the existence of territorial disputes, and responses
to the military buildup in neighboring countries.
Some of defense equipment importing countries adopt


**Chapter**


The seven participating countries in the project are Finland, France, Germany, the Netherlands, Poland, Sweden, and Norway.

There are nine countries involved in the joint development and production of the F-35 fighter jets: Australia, Canada, Denmark, Italy, the Netherlands, Norway, Turkey, the United Kingdom, and the
United States. The other countries acquiring them are Israel, the ROK, Belgium, Poland and Japan, whose defense technological and industrial base is involved in their production and maintenance.
However, after Turkey purchased Russian S-400 missile systems, the United States decided in July 2019 to initiate the process to formally remove Turkey from the joint program.

The EDF was founded in June 2017.

In 2016, the United Kingdom launched the Defence and Security Accelerator (DASA) to build an innovation network of government, private sector and academics and created a fund for innovative

The United States has proceeded with a variety of
space activities in fields including military, science, and
resource exploration, such as launching the world’s first
reconnaissance satellite and landing on the Moon. Today,
the United States is the world’s leading space power.
This includes the world’s first launch of a private-sector
manned space flight by SpaceX in May 2020. The U.S.
Forces clearly recognize the importance of outer space
for their actions, and on this point, actively utilize outer
space for security purposes.
The U.S. National Security Strategy (NSS) released
in December 2017 pointed out that some countries are
pursuing a variety of ASATs on the basis of belief that the
capability to attack assets in outer space will give them
asymmetrical advantages. The United States released its
National Space Strategy in March 2018, demonstrating
its recognition that its adversaries had turned space into
a warfighting domain and vowing to deter and defeat
threats in the space domain to protect the national
interests of the United States and its allies. Additionally,
in June 2020, the United States Department of Defense
(DoD) announced the country’s Defense Space Strategy
(DSS), presenting guidelines for the next 10 years, which
appraises China and Russia as the most serious and
eminent threats. It also establishes the three targets of
(1) build a comprehensive military advantage in space;
(2) integrate military spacepower into national, joint,
and combined operations; and (3) secure a stable space
domain. Furthermore, the United States government
says it will continue to use space for national security
activities under the principles of the peaceful use of space
found in the National Space Policy (NSP) announced in
December 2020.
Also, in December 2020, Japan and the United States

**2 China**

China began working on space development in the
1950s and launched its first satellite “Dong Fang Hong
I” in 1970. Recently, in January 2019, China became
the first country in the world to land an unmanned
spacecraft (“Chang’e 4”) on the far side of the moon,
and it successfully launched “Chang’e 5” in November
2020 and Mars explorer “Tianwen 1” in July 2020.
Additionally, the country’s constellation plan for around
13,000 communication satellites is pointed out, and
in September 2020, China launched a satellite payload
rocket “Long March 11” from a ship in the Yellow Sea,
and the core module of the China Space Station (CSS)[2]
in April 2021. In this manner, China has been increasing
its space activities. It is speculated that such space
development is intended to enhance national prestige and

reported to have been developing and producing ballistic
missiles as well, indicating that the technology used in
the development of satellite launch vehicles is applicable
to the development of ballistic missiles.
China is thus expected to focus on space development
through close cooperation between government, military,
and private sectors. China is considered to have become
one of the space powers through investments, research
and development, and the introduction of technologies
from the United States and other countries. It has been
suggested that China could threaten U.S. superiority in
outer space in the future.[5]

The Strategic Support Force, established in December
2015 as a force under direct control by the Central Military
Commission, is considered to be in charge of outer space,
cyber, and electronic warfare missions, including the
launching and tracking of satellites, although the details
of its missions and organization have not been published.
The Equipment Development Department of the Central
Military Commission is believed to be in charge of
crewed space programs.

develop space resources.
In its 2019 defense white paper, released in July 2019
and titled “China’s National Defense in the New Era,”
China asserts that outer space is a critical domain in
international strategic competition and that outer space
security provides strategic assurance for national and
social development. In addition, the “14th five-year
plan and long-range objectives to 2035” adopted at the
National People’s Congress held in March 2021 revealed
a policy to accelerate the development of aerospace fields.
While traditionally emphasizing international
cooperation and the peaceful use of space, China has
not ruled out its military use of space and proactively
used space for military purposes, including information
collection, communications, and positioning through
satellites. China continues to develop ASATs. In January
2007, China conducted a test using a ground-launched
missile for destroying its own satellite. In July 2014,
China implemented an anti-satellite missile test[3] without
actually destroying any satellite. It is also suggested
that China is developing killer satellites, jammers, and
directed-energy weapons,[4] including laser beams. It is
pointed out that the BeiDou satellite positioning system,
for which the launch of all satellites comprising the
system was completed in June 2020, could be used for
military purposes. A Chinese state-owned corporation,
which develops and produces launch vehicles, has
claimed to continue the launch of new rockets in the
Long March series and develop a launch vehicle that can
carry a large satellite. However, the corporation has been

Russia’s space activities have been continuing since
the former Soviet Union era. The former Soviet Union
successively launched multiple satellites and had the
largest number of launched satellites in the world until
the collapse of the Soviet Union. Russia’s space activities
have declined since the former Soviet Union collapsed in
1991. In recent years, however, the country has restarted
these activities and is reinvigorating space development,
including the plan for the “Sfera” concept integrating 600
satellites for observation, meteorology, communications
and positioning by 2030.
Regarding the country’s trends in security, in
response to the United States’ release of the annual
MDR in 2018, Russia expressed concern that the
implementation of plans in the MDR would trigger an
arms race in space with hugely negative consequences
for world peace and stability.
In March 2016, Russia released the Federal Space
Program for 2016-2025 as a specific future guideline
for space activities, including the development and
deployment of domestic space satellites and crewed
flight programs.
Meanwhile, Russia has used its outer space capabilities
for military operations in Syria. Russian Minister of
Defense Shoigu revealed at a meeting of the Ministry
of Defence in 2019 that he has become aware of the

need to rebuild the country’s military satellites based
on this tactical experience. It is also noted that Russia
has continued ASAT development, repeated tests to fire
ground-launched anti-satellite missiles, and has been
developing anti-satellite missiles launched from MiG-31
fighter jets, as well as laser weapon systems, such as the
Sokol Eshelon system for aircraft.
From an organizational perspective, State Space
Corporation ROSCOSMOS is in charge of space activities
related to Russia’s scientific and economic areas, while
the Russian Ministry of Defence is involved in space
activities for security purposes. The Russian Aerospace
Forces, into which the Air Force and the Aerospace
Defence Forces were integrated in August 2015, conduct
actual space activities for military purposes and manage
facilities for launching satellites.

The document referred to the creation of a space command
and the enhancement of threat identification and space
situation surveillance capabilities. In September 2019,
France created the space command under the Air Force
to integrate functions and personnel of a military space
surveillance operation center, a joint space command and
a military satellite surveillance center within the Armed
Forces Ministry. Also, in July 2020, the country changed
the name of the Air Force to the Air and Space Force,
adding activities for guaranteeing freedom of behavior in
space and free access to space within the operations of
the Air Force.

India has promoted programs to develop communications,
positioning and observation satellites. At their second
meeting of their foreign and defense ministers in October

continue discussing defense cooperation in outer space.
India is believed to have operated the Navigation
Indian Constellation (NavIC) satellite as a positioning
satellite that can position locations around India. In
February 2017, India successfully launched a satellite
launch vehicle loaded with 104 satellites at low cost,
which indicates its high technological capabilities. In
March 2019, Prime Minister Modi announced that the
country successfully tested a missile to destroy a loworbit satellite.
Among organizations, the Space Agency oversees
the Indian Space Research Organization (ISRO),
which implements space development policy, develops
and launches launch vehicles, and develops and
manufactures satellites. It has been reported that the
Ministry of Defence approved the creation of the
Defence Space Agency (DSA) to control ASATs and
other space assets, and to plan defense policies regarding
outer space in April 2019. The ministry also approved
the establishment of the Defence Space Research
Agency (DSRA) to develop weapons and technology
for outer space warfare in June 2019.

**6 The ROK**


Regarding European outer space activities, the EU, the
European Space Agency (ESA), and European countries
are promoting their own unique space activities and are
cooperating with each other to implement space activities.
In September 2019, before taking office as President
of the European Commission, Ursula von der Leyen
stated she would establish a defense and space branch
to take charge of military fundraising, development and
deployment within the commission. A satellite positioning
system called “Galileo” and an Earth observation
program named “Copernicus” under planning by the EU
and ESA, and a reconnaissance satellite project called
“Multinational Space-based Imaging System (MUSIS)”
of the European Defense Agency (EDA) are expected to
be utilized for the security field in Europe.
Also, in June 2019, NATO approved a space strategy
forming the guidelines for NATO’s approach to space.
In December the same year, at the NATO leaders’
summit, space was declared as the “fifth tactical
domain” next to land, sea, air and cyberspace. This
shows NATO’s awareness concerning the importance
of security in the space domain. In October 2020, the
NATO Defense Ministers Meeting was held, where an
agreement was reached to establish a new space center
in Ramstein, Germany.
The United Kingdom, which exited the EU at the
end of 2020, announced in January 2021 that it would
not participate in the Galileo Program. Additionally, the
United Kingdom created the Space Command under the
Royal Air Force, and it plans to launch its own satellite
aboard its own rocket from Scotland in 2022. It is now
moving ahead with active investment in the space field,
including creation of a new national testing facility to
test a cutting-edge space propulsion engine initiated at


The ROK’s space development is promoted based on
the Third Basic Space Development Promotion Plan
announced by the Moon administration under the Space
Development Promotion Act implemented in 2005. The
plan proposes a vision towards 2040, giving priority

technology, (2) the advancement of satellite-using
services and satellite development, (3) the initiation of
space exploration, and (4) the development of the Korean
Positioning System (KPS). In July 2020, SpaceX of the
United States successfully launched the ROK’s military
geosynchronous communications satellite.
Among organizations, the Korea Aerospace Research
Institute leads research and development as an
implementation agency. Furthermore, the Korea Agency
for Defense Development is engaged in the development


and use of various satellites. Also, to secure space
surveillance capabilities above the Korean Peninsula, the
country created the Air Force Satellite Surveillance and
Control Unit, the country’s first space force, in 2019. The
name of this force was changed to the Air Force Space
Operation Unit in 2020.
The ROK’s Ministry of National Defense says it plans
to secure surveillance, reconnaissance, and early warning
satellites in order to strengthen space related capabilities.[6]

cyber capabilities.

1 According to “Worldwide Threat Assessment,” Director of National Intelligence (March 2018)


-----

China is suspected of conducting cyber attacks and
other activities to steal confidential information even in
peacetime.[3] For example, its involvement in the following
incidents has been pointed out.

-  In January and February 2018, Chinese government
hackers hacked a U.S. Navy contractor, leading to a
leak of classified information on supersonic anti-ship
missiles mounted on submarines.

-  In December 2018, such countries as the United States
announced that the APT10 cyber group related to
China’s Ministry of National Security conducted cyber
attacks on intellectual and other properties in at least
12 countries.

-  In Japan, it has been confirmed that the APT10
group conducted extensive cyber attacks on private
enterprises, academic organizations and other targets.

-  In 2017, a U.S. consumer credit information company
came under a cyber attack stealing personal information
including names, birthdates, social security numbers,
driver’s license numbers, and credit card numbers.
In February 2020, the U.S. Department of Justice
prosecuted four Chinese military-related persons for
their alleged involvement in the cyber attack.

-  In July 2020, the U.S. Department of Justice prosecuted
two individuals who were alleged to be related to
China’s Ministry of State Security for launching a
cyber attack aimed at stealing intellectual property
and trade secrets from private companies, including
companies involved in the development of vaccines
for COVID-19.

-  In April 2021, the investigating authorities of Japan
concluded that the series of cyber attacks against
around 200 domestic companies were launched by the
cyber group Tick, and that there was a high probability
that a unit of the People’s Liberation Army was
involved in the attack behind the group.

**2 Russia**


systems of adversaries,[5] with approximately 1,000
personnel. Russia’s “Doctrine of Information Security,”
released in December 2016, acknowledged an increase
in threats related to the use of information technology
for military and political purposes. In November 2019,
Russia enforced the so-called sovereign Internet law to
secure the continuity of Russian networks by shutting
them out from global networks in the event of an incident
like a cyber attack.
It is pointed out that Russia has taken advantage of
cyberspace for intelligence operations not only to steal
information and conduct sabotage operations but also to
challenge democratic processes[6] and has been involved in
the following incidents:

-  In June 2017, cyber attacks using the so-called NotPetya
ransomware occurred in Ukraine and other countries.
In February 2018, the U.S. and U.K. governments
attributed the attacks to the Russian military.

-  In February 2020, U.S., U.K., Georgian and other
governments announced that the GRU was responsible
for large-scale cyber attacks on Georgian government
agencies and media organizations in October 2019.[7]

-  In October 2020, the U.S. Department of Justice
announced the prosecution of six officers of the GRU
for being involved in cyber attacks on the Ukrainian
power networks in 2015 and 2016 and cyber activities
against the Pyeongchang Olympics in 2017 and 2018.
Moreover, the U.K. supported the announcement by
the U.S. and announced that Russia had conducted
cyber reconnaissance on organizations related to the
Tokyo Olympics and Paralympics in 2020.

-  In December 2020, it became clear that U.S.
government agencies had been exposed to cyber
espionage over a long period of time. In relation to this
case, the U.S. government asserted in January 2021 that
the target of this attack was to collect information, and
in April 2021, the governments of the U.S. and U.K.
announced the attack was by the Foreign Intelligence
Service (SVR).

-  In April 2021, the U.S. Government sanctioned 32
entities and individuals who carried out attempts led
by the Russian Government to influence the 2020
U.S. presidential election, and other information
falsification and interference.


**Chapter**


It has been pointed out that the Main Intelligence
Directorate of the General Staff of the Russian Armed
Forces (GRU) and the Federal Security Service of the
Russian Federation (FSB) are involved in cyber attacks.
It has also been revealed that the Russian military has
its own cyber command unit,[4] which is believed to be
responsible for conducting offensive cyber activities,
including inserting malware into command and control


According to “Cyber Strategy,” U.S. DoD (September 2018)

According to a statement made by Russian Minister of Defence Shoigu during a briefing for the lower house in February 2017, that the Russian military has a cyber command for countering political
propaganda in Russia’s ongoing information war with Western countries. However, the minister fell short of naming the command.

According to then U.S. Director of National Intelligence Clapper’s written testimony on “Worldwide Cyber Threats” at the House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence in September 2015

According to the “Cyber Strategy,” U.S. DoD (September 2018)


-----

released in April 2021, the Panel evaluated continued
attacks against financial institutions and virtual
currency exchange houses as generating revenue to
support the country’s weapons of mass destruction and
ballistic missile programs.


**3 North Korea**


It has been pointed out that the North Korean authority
trains hackers[8] and has intensively built up cyber units
operating some 6,800 personnel.[9] In September 2019, the
U.S. Department of the Treasury announced sanctions
targeting three cyber groups, including Lazarus Group,[10]
supported by the North Korean authority responsible for
their involvement in malicious cyber activities targeting
key infrastructure.
North Korea is alleged to have been developing
capabilities to steal money and secret military information
through cyber attacks, as well as developing attack
capabilities against key foreign critical infrastructure
through cyber attacks. It is suspected of having been
involved in the following incidents.

-  In May 2017, a cyber attack used a malware called
WannaCry to encrypt and neutralize electronic data
held by hospitals, schools, businesses, and other
entities in more than 150 countries. Japan, the United
States, the United Kingdom, Australia, Canada, and
New Zealand announced a statement blaming North
Korea for its involvement in the attack. It was pointed
out that this cyber attack succeeded in collecting
140,000 dollars in Bitcoins.

-  In September 2017, multiple U.S. electric power
utilities were inflicted with cyber attacks using spear
phishing emails. In October 2017, FireEye, a U.S.
cybersecurity company, announced that the attacks
had been conducted by a cyber threat group allegedly
affiliated with North Korea.

-  In February 2021, the U.S. Department of Justice
prosecuted three North Koreans working under the
North Korean Reconnaissance General Bureau on
suspicion of involvement in a cyber attack.

-  In the final report of the UN Security Council’s
Panel of Experts assisting the North Korea Sanctions
Committee (“Final Report of the Panel of Experts
submitted pursuant to resolution 2515 (2020)”)

9 According to the ROK’s 2018 Defense White Paper (January 2019)


**4 Trends Concerning Other Threats**

Supply chain risks, including products embedded
with deliberately and fraudulently altered programs,
and the existence of advanced malware designed to
attack industrial control systems are also pointed out.
In this respect, the U.S. Congress in August 2018
passed the National Defense Authorization Act of
2019 including provisions prohibiting government
agencies from using products of major Chinese
communications equipment manufacturers, such
as Huawei Technologies Co. The United States has
provided its allies with information about risks
accompanying Chinese communications equipment
and urged them not to use such equipment. In response,
Australia has banned China’s Huawei and ZTE
Corporation from taking part in its fifth-generation
mobile communications system development project,
while the United Kingdom has announced its policy to
remove all Huawei products from its fifth-generation
mobile communications system network by the end
of 2027.
Moreover, in the midst of the turmoil caused by
COVID-19, cyber attacks that steal information
on vaccine and treatment research data from
pharmaceutical companies and research institutions and
exploit the vulnerability of remote work infrastructure
are frequently occurring. In response to this situation,
NATO issued a statement in June 2020 condemning
malicious cyber activities against those involved in
pandemic responses, including medical and research
institutions.

Given these growing threats in cyberspace, various

**3** **Initiatives against Cyberspace Threats**

initiatives are under way.
It is regarded that the international community has
diverging views concerning the fundamental matters
of cyberspace, including how international law applies.
For instance, the United States, Europe, and Japan have
called for maintaining a free cyberspace, while Russia,
China, and most emerging countries sought to strengthen
state control on cyberspace. Against this backdrop,
there has been a movement to promote the rule of law
in cyberspace in the international community. For
instance, discussions are being held on the establishment
of international rules within the framework of global
conferences on cyberspace.

and that a cyber attack could, in certain circumstances,
constitute an armed attack for the purposes of the U.S.Japan Security Treaty.
The U.S. Forces include Cyber Command, which was
elevated to a unified combatant command in May 2018
to control cyberspace operations. The Command consists
of the Cyber Protection Force (68 teams), which operates
and defends the DoD Information Network, the Cyber
National Mission Force (13 teams), which supports the
U.S. defense against national-state threats, and the Cyber
Combat Mission Force (27 teams), which supports the
operations conducted by unified combatant commands
on the cyber front (these three Forces are collectively
referred to as the Cyber Mission Force, consisting of 133
teams including 25 support teams, with approximately
6,200 personnel).


**Chapter**


In the United States, the Department of Homeland
Security is responsible for protecting federal government
networks and critical infrastructure against cyber attacks,
and the Department’s Cybersecurity Infrastructure
Security Agency (CISA) works to protect the networks
of government agencies. The National Defense
Authorization Act for FY2021 clearly stated that the
post of National Cyber Director will be established at the
White House.
The U.S. NSS (December 2017) points out that
many countries now view cyber capabilities as tools for
projecting influence and that cyber attacks have become
a key feature of modern conflict. It also notes that the
United States would deter, defend, and when necessary
defeat malicious actors who inflict cyber attacks
on the United States. The U.S. DoD in its National
Defense Strategy (January 2018) described a policy of
investing in cyber defense, resilience, and the continued
integration of cyber capabilities into the full spectrum
of military operations. Furthermore, the DoD Cyber
Strategy (September 2018) points out that the United
States is engaged in a long-term strategic competition
with China and Russia, and that China and Russia
have expanded that competition to include persistent
campaigns in and through cyberspace that pose longterm strategic risk to the United States as well as to its
allies and partners.
In April 2019, at the U.S.-Japan Security
Consultative Committee (2+2), the two countries
agreed to enhance cooperation on cyber issues and
affirmed that international law applies in cyberspace


**2 North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO)**
**and European Union (EU)**

At the NATO Summit in September 2014, an agreement
was reached that NATO’s collective defense applies to
cyber attacks against member states.
On the organizational front, in November 2017,
an agreement was reached on the creation of a new
Cyber Operations Center and the integration of NATO
member countries’ cyber defense capabilities into
NATO missions and operations. The Cyber Operations
Center located in Belgium is expected to be fully
operational with cyber attack capabilities by 2023.
Furthermore, NATO has conducted cyber defense
training exercises annually since 2008 to heighten
cyber defense capabilities. In addition, NATO has
expanded cooperation with the EU in the fields of
cybersecurity and cyber defense.
In 2008 the NATO Cooperative Cyber Defence

established in Estonia’s capital of Tallinn. CCDCOE
carries out research on the relationship between cyber
activities and international law and published the
“Tallinn Manual 2.0” in February 2017. The manual
takes into consideration broad discussion points,
from peacetime legal regimes, such as laws on state
responsibility, human rights, aviation, space, and
maritime affairs, to contingency legal regimes, such as
laws on armed conflicts. In December 2019, NATO held
its “Cyber Coalition 2019” exercise, in which Japan
officially participated for the first time in addition to
27 NATO member countries and the EU. In April 2021,
Japan also officially participated for the first time in
Locked Shields 2021, a cyber defense exercise hosted
by the CCDCOE.
The EU announced its decision to sanction six
individuals of Chinese and Russian nationality and
three organizations from China, North Korea, and
Russia that launched cyber attacks within Europe in
July 2020. In addition, it made a joint announcement
with the United Kingdom in October that it would
impose sanctions on Russia for cyber attacks on the
German parliament building. In December 2020,
the EU pointed out the lack of collective situational
awareness on cyber threats within the region, and
advocated for the establishment of a cross-disciplinary
Joint Cyber Unit between the private, diplomatic,
police and defense sectors in the EU’s Cybersecurity
Strategy in the Digital Decade.

**3 The United Kingdom**


Moreover, the 13th Signal Regiment was established
in June 2020 for the protection of military networks.
In November 2020, the establishment of the
National Cyber Force (NCF) was announced, which
consolidates personnel from GCHQ, the Ministry of
Defence, and others to carry out activities such as
preventing serious crimes and disrupting adversary
weapon systems.

**4 Australia**


In its first “National Security Strategy” published in
January 2013, Australia positions integrated cyber
policies and operations as one of the top national
security priorities. In the Cyber Security Strategy
announced in August 2020, Australia clearly states
it will ensure not only its defense capabilities in
cyberspace, but also its authority and technical
strength of offensive capabilities in order to ensure the
country’s network safety.
On the organizational front, cybersecurity
capabilities across the government were converged
to establish the Australian Cyber Security Center
(ACSC), which addresses major cybersecurity
issues related to government agencies and critical
infrastructure. In July 2015, the ACSC issued its
first report on cybersecurity, which contends that the
number, type, and sophistication of cyber threats to
Australia are all increasing. Moreover, the Australian
Defence Force created the Information Warfare
Division under the Joint Capabilities Group in July
2017 and established the Defence Signals Intelligence
and Cyber Command under the division in January
2018. In October 2019, the Royal Australian Air
Force offered to recruit cyber skills officers to protect
networks, data and information systems.

**5 The ROK**


**Chapter**


The United Kingdom, in its “National Security Strategy
and Strategic Defence and Security Review (NSSSDSR2015)” released in November 2015, committed
to investing £1.9 billion over the next five years in
increasing its cyber defense capabilities to strengthen
the functions for identifying and analyzing cyberspace
threats. In November 2016, the country announced a
new “Cyber Security Strategy” that presents a vision for
the United Kingdom, which is to be secure and resilient
to cyber threats, prosperous and confident in the digital
world. To achieve this vision, the Strategy requires the
United Kingdom to deter cyber threats by having effective
defensive and offensive means and to “develop” cuttingedge technologies.
On the organizational front, in October 2016, the
National Cyber Security Centre (NCSC) was newly
established under the Government Communications
Headquarters (GCHQ) to promote public-private
partnerships for responses to national cyber incidents


In December 2018, the ROK released the “National
Security Strategy of the Moon Jae-in Government,”
pledging to enhance cyber threat prevention and response
capabilities based on cooperation among private,
government and military sectors in responding to cyber
threats and to activate relevant international cooperation.
The ROK also formulated its first “National Cybersecurity
Strategy” in April 2019 to protect the safety of the people
and enhance national security, and released the “National
Cybersecurity Basic Plan” to materialize the strategy in
September 2019.
In terms of national defense, the ROK’s military has
established a structure to perform cyber operations led
by the Joint Chiefs of Staff in 2019 while developing a

Many other NATO member countries are also
developing equipment for severe electronic warfare
environments and allegedly conducting electronic
warfare-oriented exercises with Russian forces’ electronic
warfare equipment in mind.[1]

**2 China**


**1 The United States and Europe**

The United States is committed to expanding electronic
warfare training and equipment and to enhancing
cooperation with its allies under an initiative to
aggressively achieve its dominance in the electromagnetic
domain. In addition, the Electromagnetic Spectrum
Superiority Strategy announced by the U.S. Department
of Defense in October 2020, indicates the recognition
of importance to ensure freedom of action in the
electromagnetic spectrum for the success of operations
in all areas.
As an example of military operations using electronic
warfare equipment, there is an assessment that U.S.
electronic warfare units used EA-18G electronic warfare
aircraft in Libya in 2011 to jam ground radar of the
Libyan Government forces, preventing their attacks on
NATO aircraft. It is pointed out that the LMADIS (Light
Marine Air Defense System) counter unmanned aircraft
system with electronic warfare capabilities was used
for leading an Iranian drone to crash over the Strait of
Hormuz in July 2019.
In the U.S. military organization, the Electro Magnetic
Spectrum Operation Cross Functional Team was
established under the Secretary of Defense in 2019, and
in January of the same year, the army newly established
the I2CEWS unit, which comprises a part of the MultiDomain Task Force that integrates information, space,
cyber, and electronic warfare missions. Moreover, the
U.S. Air Force activated the 16th Air Force in October
of the same year to integrate functions for ISR, cyber


China has set an initiative to put cyber warfare and other
electronic elements, and physical destruction and other
non-electronic elements, under unified control.[2] Also, it
has been pointed out that its electronic warfare strategy
is focused on controlling, deteriorating, damaging, and
deceiving enemy electronic equipment.[3] Under the
initiative, China conducts force-on-force exercises on
a routine basis to effectively accomplish missions in
complicated electromagnetic environments, improving
practical capabilities. It is pointed out that China’s armed
forces have taken advantage of such exercises to assess
electronic warfare weapon research and development
achievements.[4] The Strategic Support Force, established
at the end of 2015 for improving overall military
operational capabilities, is said to be responsible for such
domains as electronic warfare, cyber and space.
China’s TU-154 intelligence and Y-8 electronic warfare
aircraft have been seen flying around the Nansei Islands
and the Sea of Japan in the vicinity of Japan. It is also
reported that China has mounted electronic warfare pods
for jamming missions on J-15 fighters, H-6 bombers,
and other aircraft, and deployed a jamming system on
Mischief Reef of the Spratly Islands.[5]

**3 Russia**


**Chapter**


Russia, in its Military Doctrine, positions electronic
warfare equipment as important equipment in modern
military conflict. It is noted that Russia used electronic
warfare equipment in the “Vostok 2018” exercise in
September 2018, the “Tsentr 2019” exercise in September
2019 and other exercises. It is also pointed out that
Russian forces have positioned electronic warfare as part
of offensive means and improved practical electronic
warfare capabilities in recent years.[6]

electronic warfare system Bylina, which is equipped
with artificial intelligence and controls all the associated
electronic warfare equipment, was used in the military

electronic reconnaissance aircraft’s long-range flights
over the Sea of Japan have been seen.

China’s Ministry of National Defense announcing that it
would conduct these patrols regularly from now on. This
shows the PLA has been intensifying its operations in the
South China Sea. Under these circumstances, a further
increase in China’s aerial presence in the area could lead
to the establishment of a “South China Sea Air Defense
Identification Zone” in the future.
Furthermore, China is using methods other than
its military. For example, the China Coast Guard has
obstructed fishing and other vessels of other countries
approaching the features by firing warning shots and
water cannons at the vessels. In addition, in April 2020,
China unilaterally announced the new establishment
of administrative districts called “Xisha District” and
“Nansha District” under Sansha City, Hainan Province.
In a dangerous act that could cause unintended
consequences, PLA Navy and other ships approached
and obstructed a U.S. Navy ship sailing in the South
China Sea in September 2018.
In response to these actions by China, critical voices
are being raised by others besides claimants. For example,
in July 2020 the United States issued a statement from
the U.S. Secretary of State saying that China’s maritime
claims in the South China Sea are unlawful.

**(3) Unintended Contingency Avoidance Initiatives**
Despite these numerous acts that could pose risks to
securing the stable use of oceans and airspace, in recent
years progress has been made in efforts to avert and
prevent unintended consequences in the seas and skies.


First, at the Japan-China summit meeting held on May 9,
2018, Japan and China agreed to establish a “Maritime
and Aerial Communication Mechanism between the
Defense Authorities of Japan and China” with the aim
of avoiding unintended confrontations between the naval
vessels and aircraft of the SDF and PLA. The mechanism
went into operation in June of the same year.
As for multi-national initiatives, in April 2014,
navies of participating countries of the Western
Pacific Naval Symposium (WPNS), including Japan,
the United States, and China, adopted the Code for
Unplanned Encounters at Sea (CUES).[2] CUES sets
forth a code of conduct such as procedures and
communication method to ensure safety for unexpected
encounters by vessels or aircraft of the navies of
these countries. In November 2014, the United States
and China agreed on measures pertaining to mutual
notification of military activities, together with rules
of behavior to avert collisions in waters and airspace
in accordance with CUES and other frameworks. In
September 2015, the two countries announced an
agreement concerning an additional annex stipulating
rules of behavior to avert air encounters. Between
ASEAN and China, official discussions have been
held for the establishment of the Code of the Conduct
of Parties in the South China Sea (COC).
It is strongly hoped that these initiatives designed to
avert and prevent unintended consequences in the seas
and skies will supplement the existing international order
and that the countries concerned, including China, refrain
from unilateral actions that add to tension and act on the
basis of the principle of the rule of law.

Piracy seen at various locations has become a threat to

followed by 439 in 2011, and 297 in 2012, indicating
a downtrend (the number stood at 195 in 2020). The

**(1) Maritime Security in the Middle East**
The Middle East has seen intermittent attacks on ships in
recent years.
Since a coalition force led by Saudi Arabia launched
bombing campaigns against the Houthis in Yemen in
2015, sporadic attacks on military and commercial ships
have been seen in waters such as those off Yemen and the
Strait of Babel-Mandeb.
In the Strait of Hormuz and its vicinity, attacks on
private sector oil tankers have been seen since May 2019.
As tensions including those over U.S.-Iran relations have
increased in the Middle East, U.S. and French initiatives
have been launched to secure safe navigation.

coast of Somalia and in the Gulf of Aden rose rapidly
from 2008 to 218 in 2009, 219 in 2010, and 237 in 2011,
following a persistent uptrend, accounting for more than
half of the global total and attracting great international
concern as a threat to safe navigation. In the recent
years, however, the number of piracy incidents in
waters off the coast of Somalia and in the Gulf of Aden
has remained low as a result of various initiatives taken
by the international community including Japan (the
number stood at zero in 2020; see Part III, Chapter 3,
Section 2-2 [Counter-Piracy Operations] P. 391 for
Japan’s initiatives).
The international counterpiracy initiatives in waters
off the coast of Somalia and in the Gulf of Aden include
counterpiracy operations by the Combined Task Force
151 (CTF151), a multinational force that was created in
January 2009 by the U.S. Force-led Combined Maritime
Force (CMF)[4] based in Bahrain. So far, the United
States, Australia, the United Kingdom, Turkey, the ROK,
Pakistan and other countries have participated in the
CTF151, conducting zone defense operations to counter
piracy. The EU for its part has conducted Operation
Atalanta to counter piracy since December 2008. In the
operation, naval vessels and aircraft dispatched by EU
member countries escort ships and monitor the waters
off the coast of Somalia. It has been decided that the
operation will continue until the end of 2022.
In addition, some countries have conducted their
exclusive operations outside the abovementioned
frameworks. Since December 2008, for example, China
has deployed naval vessels for counterpiracy operations


in waters off the coast of Somalia and in the Gulf of Aden.
While the number of piracy incidents in waters off the
coast of Somalia and in the Gulf of Aden has remained
low thanks primarily to such international initiatives,
Somalia’s unstable security and poverty as fundamental
factors behind piracy have not been resolved.
Meanwhile, in Africa, piracy incidents occurred in
the Gulf of Guinea (the number of incidents was 84
in 2020). The international community has continued
counterpiracy initiatives in this region.
The number of piracy incidents in Southeast Asian
waters came to 62 in 2020. Traditionally, maritime
armed robbery incidents, including the theft of cash,
crewmembers’ belongings, ship equipment and other
items, have accounted for most of piracy incidents in the
waters. In recent years, however, they included grave
incidents in which crewmembers were kidnapped for
ransom purposes in the Sulu Sea and the Celebes Sea off
the Philippines.
Counterpiracy measures in Asia include international
information sharing and cooperation based on the
Regional Cooperation Agreement on Combating Piracy
and Armed Robbery against Ships in Asia (ReCAAP),[5]
which was worked out at Japan’s initiative and put
into force in 2006. In addition, Indonesia, Malaysia,
Singapore, and Thailand conduct the Malacca Strait
Patrols.[6] The cases of abduction for ransom have been
confirmed in the Sulu Sea and the Celebes Sea. In order to
respond to this, Indonesia, Malaysia and the Philippines
began sea patrols in the area in June 2017 and air patrols
in October of the same year.

The CMF is a multinational force, which operates to promote maritime security, stability, and prosperity, under the U.S. Central Command. Forces from 32 countries participate in the CMF, and the
Commander of the U.S. Fifth Fleet concurrently serves as the CMF Commander. The CMF is comprised of three combined task forces: Combined Task Force 150 (CTF-150), which is tasked with
maritime security operations; Combined Task Force 151 (CTF-151) with counter-piracy operations; and Combined Task Force 152 (CTF-152) with maritime security operations in the Persian Gulf.
The SDF deploy units to CTF-151.

The contracting parties to ReCAAP are the following 20 countries: Australia; Bangladesh; Brunei; Cambodia; China; Denmark; India; Japan; the ROK; Laos; Myanmar; the Netherlands; Norway; the
Philippines; Singapore; Sri Lanka; Thailand; the United Kingdom; the United States; and Vietnam.

The Malacca Strait Patrols are comprised of: the Malacca Strait Sea Patrols, which commenced in 2004; aircraft patrol activities, which commenced in 2005; and information sharing activities, which

called the Arctic Region. The Arctic Region includes
Canada, Denmark, Finland, Iceland, Norway, Russia,
Sweden and the United States. These eight are
called Arctic countries. In 1996, the Arctic countries
established the Arctic Council to promote cooperation
in their common challenges, including sustainable
development and environmental protection in the
Arctic Region.
In recent years, moves towards the utilization of
trans-Arctic navigation routes and the development
of natural resources in the Arctic Ocean have gained
momentum in line with a decline in sea ice. From
the perspective of security, the Arctic Ocean has
traditionally been used for the deployment of strategic
nuclear forces and as their transit route. With the
decrease in sea ice in recent years, ships have been
able to navigate for a longer period of time and more
extensively than before. It is therefore considered that
the region could be used for deploying maritime forces
or maneuvering military forces in the future. In this
situation, moves to deploy new military capabilities in
the ocean are seen.
In the Russian Federation’s National Security
Strategy, revised in December 2015, Russia continues
to maintain that it would secure its interests in resource
development and use of the sea route.
Russia has been developing natural gas on the Yamal
Peninsula. In 2018, liquefied natural gas produced on
the peninsula was transported to China for the first time
via an Arctic Ocean route. As for military arrangements,
in January 2021, Russia upgraded the Northern Fleet to
a military-administered district citing that it will enable
the enhancement of joint operations in the Arctic. In the
Arctic Region, Russia is constructing 10 airfields. As
for military operations, the Northern Fleet has annually
conducted a long-distance navigation to the Novo
Sibirski Islands since 2012. Russia has intensified other
Arctic military operations including SSBN submarines’
strategic nuclear deterrence patrols and long-range


bombers’ patrol flights.
In its Arctic Strategy published in June 2019, the
U.S. DoD expressed concern against actions of China
and Russia in the Arctic region[7] and a desire for the
Arctic to become a secure and stable region where
U.S. national interests are safeguarded, the U.S.
homeland is protected, and nations work cooperatively
to address challenges.[8] The U.S. Marine forces were
deployed in Norway on a rotation basis every year for
a period of six months for training since 2017, but this
rotation deployment has been changed to a form of
dispatching forces with a larger number of personnel
for a shorter period of time in conjunction with training
since October 2020. In October 2018, the U.S. sent an
aircraft carrier to the Arctic Region for the first time
in 27 years for air drills in the Norwegian Sea ahead
of the NATO exercise “Trident Juncture 2018.” In
May 2020, United States and United Kingdom vessels
took part in activities in the Barents Sea for the first
time since the end of the Cold War. In December
2016, then U.S. President Obama decided to ban
new drilling for oil and natural gas in a majority of
U.S. territorial waters in the Arctic to protect marine
resources, showing a negative stance towards resource
development. However, U.S. President Trump signed
an executive order repealing this decision of then U.S.
President Obama in April 2017.
Aside from coastal states in the Arctic Ocean, 13
countries including Japan, China, the ROK, the United
Kingdom, Germany and France, have observer status
in the Arctic Council. Notably, China has shown active
involvement in the Arctic Ocean, deploying the polar
research vessel Xue Long to the Arctic Ocean for 10
times since 1999.[9] In January 2018, they published a
white paper titled “China’s Arctic Policy” in which
they claimed to be one of the geographically closest
states to the Arctic Circle with rights pertaining to
the development of resources. They also announced
their intention to build a “Polar Silk Road.” In
September 2015, it was reported for the first time that


**Chapter**


As for Russia, the U.S. DoD pointed out in its Arctic Strategy that Russia is strengthening its presence above the Arctic Circle by deploying Arctic units and establishing new military bases. Moreover,
Russia has reportedly threatened to use force against vessels that fail to abide by Russian regulations. The DoD pointed out that Russia could utilize its military capabilities in an effort to deny access
to disputed Arctic waters or resources. As for China, the DoD pointed out in its strategy that its operations of icebreaking vessels and civilian research activities could support a future Chinese military
presence in the Arctic Ocean including deployment of submarines to the region, and also pointed out that it was attempting to gain a role in the Arctic in ways that may undermine international
rules and norms, and there is a risk that its predatory economic behavior globally may be repeated in the Arctic. In May 2019, during his visit to Finland, Secretary of State Pompeo made a speech
concerning Arctic policy, in which he stated that all relevant parties should follow the same rules and expressed caution against efforts by China and Russia to expand into the Arctic region.

In August 2019, then U.S. President Trump stated that buying Denmark’s autonomous territory Greenland was “strategically interesting.” In response, Danish Prime Minister Mette Frederiksen
described the Trump statement as “absurd” and the Greenland Government issued a statement noting that Greenland was not for sale. Then President Trump countered that he would postpone his
visit to Denmark as the prime minister was not willing to discuss any Greenland deal.

In 2012, Xue Long became the first polar research vessel to sail across the Arctic Ocean. In 2013, the cargo freighter Yong Sheng became the first Chinese commercial ship to cross the Arctic Ocean.
Canadian scientists took part in Xue Long’s voyage to the Arctic Ocean in 2017, and they succeeded for the first time in trial navigation of the Arctic Northwest Passage (along the north coast of

at relatively low cost and are easy to disguise as most
materials, equipment, and technology needed to
manufacture these weapons can be used for both military
and civilian purposes. These weapons are attractive to
states and non-state actors, such as terrorists, seeking
asymmetric means of attack.[2]

Biological weapons have the following characteristics:
(1) manufacturing is easy and inexpensive; (2) there
is usually an incubation period of a few days between
exposure and onset; (3) their use is hard to detect;
(4) even the threat of use can create great psychological
effects; and (5) they can cause mass casualties and injuries
depending on the circumstances of use and the type of
weapon. As has been pointed out, advancements in life
science could be misused or abused for the development

of biological weapons.
The United States, the United Kingdom, and France
launched missile strikes on chemical weapons-related
facilities in Syria in April 2018, determining that its Assad
regime had used chemical weapons in Eastern Ghouta.[3]
North Korea is an example of an actor that is still presumed
to possess these chemical weapons and has not entered into
the Chemical Weapons Convention (CWC). In addition,
such incidents as the Tokyo subway sarin attack in 1995
showed that the threat of the use of WMDs by terrorists is
real and that these weapons could cause serious damage
if used in cities. It is alleged that the “Novichok group,”
a substance developed by Russia, had been used for an
attack on a former Russian intelligence agent in the United
Kingdom in March 2018 and the attempted poisoning of a
Russian opposition leader in August 2020.

can be used as a means of delivering WMDs, such as NBC
weapons. As they fall at a steep angle and high speed,
highly accurate systems are required for intercepting
them effectively.

The deployment of ballistic missiles in a region where
an armed conflict is under way runs the risk of intensifying
or expanding the conflict. Additionally, it has the risk of
further heightening tension in a region where military
confrontation is ongoing, leading to the destabilization of
that region. Furthermore, ballistic missiles are used as a

country that has superior conventional forces.
In recent years, along with the threat of ballistic
missiles, analysts have pointed to the threat of cruise
missiles as a weapon which is comparatively easy for
terrorists and other non-state actors to acquire and has
the potential for proliferation. Because cruise missiles
are cheaper to produce compared to ballistic missiles and


are easy to maintain and train with, many countries either
produce or modify cruise missiles. At the same time, it
is said that cruise missiles have a higher degree of target
accuracy and that they are difficult to detect while in
flight. Moreover, because they are smaller than ballistic
missiles, cruise missiles can be concealed on a ship to
secretly approach a target and present a serious threat if
they carry WMDs in their warheads.

self-defense purposes could easily be exported or
transferred once domestic manufacturing becomes
successful. For example, certain states that do not heed
political risks have transferred WMDs and related
technologies to other states that cannot afford to invest
resources in conventional forces and attempt to offset
this with WMDs. Some of these states that seek WMDs
do not hesitate to put their land and people at risk, and
furthermore, due to their weak governance, terrorist
organizations are active in their territories. Therefore,
it is conceivable that in general, the possibility of actual
use of WMDs would increase.
Moreover, since it is uncertain whether such states can
effectively manage the related technology and materials,
there is a concern that chemical or nuclear substances
will be transferred or smuggled out from these states
with high likelihood. For example, there is a danger that
even terrorists who do not possess related technologies
would use a dirty bomb to release radioactive materials
for pollution as a means of terrorist attack so long as they
gain access to such materials. Nations across the world
share concerns regarding the acquisition and use of
WMDs by terrorists and other nonstate actors.
The proliferation of WMDs and other related
technologies has been noted in numerous instances.
For example, in February 2004, it came to light that
nuclear-related technologies, mainly uranium enrichment
technology, had been transferred to North Korea, Iran, and
Libya by Dr. A.Q. Khan and other scientists in Pakistan.
It has also been suggested that North Korea supported
Syria’s secret nuclear activities.[4]

Furthermore, there has been significant transfer and
proliferation of ballistic missiles that serve as the means
of delivery of WMDs. The former Soviet Union and
other countries exported Scud-B to many countries and
regions, including Iraq, North Korea, and Afghanistan.
China and North Korea also exported DF-3 (CSS-2) and


Scud missiles, respectively. As a result, a considerable
number of countries now possess ballistic missiles.
It is pointed out that North Korea continues to be
an outward source of proliferation of technologies,
conventional weapons and items for supply chains related
to WMDs. For example, it has been pointed out that the
Transporter-Erector-Launcher (TEL) for two types of
short-range ballistic missile test launched in 2019 were
sand or tan colored for marketing purposes.[5]

North Korea made rapid strides in the development
of its ballistic missiles with only a few test launches in
the 1980s and 1990s. It is believed that an underlying
factor behind this fact was North Korea’s imports of
various materials and technologies from outside of North
Korea. It is also noted that North Korea transfers ballistic
missile airframes and related technologies and promotes
the further development of missiles using funds procured
through such transfer.[6]

The international community’s uncompromising and
decisive stance against the transfer and proliferation of
WMDs and other technologies has put significant pressure
on countries engaged in related activities, leading some of
them to accept inspections by international organizations
or abandon their WMD and other programs altogether.
Meanwhile, it is pointed out that, in recent years, states
in which transferring is a concern have sustained their
external transfer while averting international monitoring
by falsifying documentation, diversifying transport
routes, and utilizing multiple front companies and
intermediaries to illicitly export WMDs. Additionally,
intangible technology transfer has arisen as a cause for
concern. Namely, those states have obtained advanced
technologies which could be adapted for the development
and manufacturing of WMDs and other technologies via
their nationals — researchers and students who have
been dispatched to leading companies and academic
institutions in developed countries.

the establishment of the caliphate[2] based on its own
interpretation of Sharia law and the protection of
Sunni[3] Muslims. ISIL expanded its presence from 2013
in Iraq and Syria, which had been destabilized due to
religious disputes and civil war, and took control of
northern and eastern Syria and northern Iraq from
January 2014. In June 2014, ISIL unilaterally declared
the establishment of the Islamic State, with Baghdadi
as its leader.
In response to the expansion of ISIL’s reach, the
Coalition forces led by the United States have been
conducting air strikes in Iraq and Syria since August
and September of the same year, respectively. The
coalition forces have also engaged in providing local
forces with education, training, and weapons, and
conducting hostage rescue by the special forces. In
cooperation with such military operations and with
support from the United States and other countries,
the Iraqi Security Forces and local forces in Iraq and
Syria proceeded to recapture ISIL’s strongholds. In
March 2019, then U.S. President Trump declared in
a statement that the United States and coalition forces
had liberated 100% of ISIL-controlled areas in Syria
and Iraq. Meanwhile, with the support from Russia,
the Assad administration conquered ISIL strongholds
mainly in southern and eastern Syria. In December
2017, Russia declared that Syria’s entire territory had
been liberated from ISIL. In October 2019, the United
States announced that it had killed ISIL’s leader
Baghdadi in northwestern Syria.
While anti-ISIL military operations have made
progress, it is pointed out that about 10,000 ISIL
fighters remain active in Iraq and Syria.[4] In this
regard, terrorist attacks believed to be conducted
by ISIL are occurring in various regions of Iraq and
Syria, targeting security forces, the Coalition forces,
citizens and others, indicating that ISIL remains
still active. In Syria, in particular, it is pointed out
that ISIL may regain strength by exploiting the
drawdown of some U.S. forces in northeastern Syria
and the launch of Turkish military operations against


Kurdish groups in October 2019 to reconstitute its
capabilities and resources in Syria and strengthen
its ability to plan attacks abroad.[5] Furthermore,
ISIL is calling for supporters so as to prepare for
terrorist acts by taking advantage of the situation
where Europe and North America is distracted by the
COVID-19 pandemic. There is also a report that ISIL
is conducting recruiting activities targeting youth
who are experiencing economic hardships during the
COVID-19 pandemic.[6]

Meanwhile, after ISIL declared the establishment
of the “Islamic State,” multiple “provinces” have been
established outside of Iraq and Syria as the “Islamic
State” territories, and these “provinces” have been
conducting terrorist acts in various places.

See Fig. I-3-7-1 (Major Terrorist Groups Based in Africa and the

Middle East)

Organizations supporting ISIL exist in Southeast
Asia and have conducted terrorist attacks targeting
security forces and citizens. Moreover, in South Asia,
large-scale explosions occurred simultaneously in Sri
Lanka in April 2019, claiming the life of a Japanese
national. The Sri Lanka authority exposed a local
Islamic extremist organization as the perpetrator
while referring to possible support for the organization
from a foreign terrorist organization. After the attack,
ISIL claimed responsibility for it, and the United
States points out that the terrorist attacks may have
been inspired by ISIL. As ISIL is spreading violent
extremist ideologies through social media and other
means, there are concerns that the threat is spreading
to South Asia and other areas. Additionally, terrorism
has become increasingly serious in the Africa region.
Especially in Western Africa, there have been a
number of attacks by terrorist groups pledging
allegiance to ISIL, with the number of victims and
refugees increasing sharply.
In addition, there continues to be a concern in
Western countries that foreign fighters entering Iraq
and Syria will return to their home countries to carry
out a terrorist act after receiving combat training and
gaining combat experience in the countries. Terrorist

The term means “successor” in Arabic. After Prophet Muhammad died, the term was used to refer to the leader of the Islamic community. Afterwards, monarchs of hereditary dynasties, including the
Umayyad and Abbasid dynasties, utilized this title.

One of the two major sects of Islam. The split from the Shia sect originated in the difference in views on the successors (caliphate) to the Prophet Muhammad (died in 632), who founded Islam.
Sunni Islam, currently the largest sect, is the majority in most of the Muslim countries in the Middle East and North Africa region. Shia Islam is the state religion in Iran and Shiites are also the

military’s missions in some cases.
Given this background, President Biden issued an
executive order on tackling the climate crisis in January
2021, following his inauguration. This order includes a
section that restates the Presidential Memorandum issued
by the Obama administration, titled Climate Change
and National Security, indicating policy continuity from
the administration. The recognition that climate change
has become a climate crisis is showed in the order, and
putting climate crisis at the center of United States foreign
policy and national security. The order directed the U.S.
Secretary of Defense to analyze the security implications
of climate change, and incorporate such impacts into the
formulation of strategic and policy documents, including
the National Defense Strategy. Consequently, a statement
on climate change was made by U.S. Secretary of Defense
Austin and he said that the DoD has acknowledged that the
changing climate has a dramatic effect on their missions,
plans and installations. According to the statement,
the DoD has been experiencing impacts of increasing
incidents of flooding, drought, wildfires, and extreme
weather events on their installations in the U.S. every
year. It was also stated that the U.S. Forces commanders
conduct operations that result from instability in societies
strained by desertification, the threat of adversary access
to homelands of the U.S. through the Arctic, and the
demands for humanitarian assistance worldwide. The
DoD recognizes climate change as an essential element
in national security and will include such impacts in
strategy development and planning guidance as directed
by President Biden. This statement also mentions
spurring the development of climate-friendly technology
and changing how to approach the carbon footprint.
France, one of the leading countries in international
initiatives concerning climate change, puts climate
change at the forefront of a number of risks and indicates
its view that there is a need for the military operational
adaptation and contribution to sustainable development
from the perspective of France having vast sea areas in
overseas territories. The French Ministry of Armed Forces
stated in a policy document on climate change published
in 2018 that the intensification of extreme weather events
amplifies the number and severity of humanitarian crises,
requiring a greater mobilization of military forces. It also
announced the GREEN DEFENCE strategy to favor
eco-design for military equipment and optimize carbon
footprint of military infrastructures by better energy
efficiency and using renewable energies


Australia, as a country that is closely related to
Oceanic island nations, which are considered to be one
of the most vulnerable countries to climate change,
considers the vulnerability of its neighboring countries
to climate change as one of the main factors in forming
its strategic environment, and has been implementing
policies proactively to prevent destabilization in the
region. In the Defense White Paper released in February
2016 by the Australian Department of Defense, climate
change was noted as a major challenge for countries in
Australia’s immediate region, and Australia indicated
the importance of supporting these countries because
instability in the immediate region could lead to severe
impacts on Australia. Moreover, it was pointed out that
rising sea levels will place pressure on navy bases,
and more extreme weather events are more frequently
putting defense facilities at the risk of damage. The
Department of Defense will be appropriately postured
for climate change.
New Zealand, another country closely related to
Oceanic island nations, indicated a policy that places
preparation and response to climate change as a
top priority for the military. It was stated in a policy
document released by the New Zealand Ministry of
Defense in November 2019 that ensuring the ability to
operate and undertake tasks in New Zealand’s territory
and its neighborhood is the highest priority, and
response to climate change is a key component of this
priority. In addition, it was also stated that humanitarian
assistance and disaster relief operations are expected
to increase in the future, particularly in New Zealand’s
neighborhood, and there is a need to adapt to the
growing number of tasks induced by climate change.
Moreover, assuming the maritime operations’ increase
due to climate change, it has indicated its plan to meet
the demand of such operations through the defense
capability plan involving enhancements to sealift, airlift
and maritime domain awareness capabilities, as well
as an increase in the size of the New Zealand Army to
6,000 personnel. Additionally, New Zealand Defence
is establishing a method of measuring greenhouse gas
emissions for mitigation in the future.
In this manner, the recognition that climate change
may cause various impacts on the security environment
and the military has been shared rapidly. In April 2021,
the Climate Security Session was held at the Leaders’
Summit on Climate hosted by the United States. The
session, moderated by U.S. Secretary of Defense Austin,
was attended by Minister of Defense Kishi, the U.S.
Director of National Intelligence, the U.S. ambassador
to the UN, Secretary General of the North Atlantic
Treaty Organization (NATO), defense ministers from

global security issues caused by climate change and
their countermeasures. During the discussions, defense
officials noted that their ministries are increasingly
called upon to respond to disasters thus elevating the
need for enhanced disaster preparedness and response.


In addition, they described the benefits of collaboration
between defense ministers on shared climate crisis. As
the defense authorities consider their measures and begin
tackling them, climate change requires close monitoring
with keen attention as a security issue.

depending on its purpose, scale and manner, etc.
Japan, as a matter of course, will make the utmost
diplomatic efforts, should a dispute occur, for its peaceful
settlement and take all necessary responses in accordance
with the existing domestic laws and regulations developed
based upon the constitutional interpretation to date. It is
still required, however, to make all necessary preparations
in order to ensure Japan’s survival and protect its people.
Under such recognition and as a result of careful
examination in light of the current security environment,
it has been concluded that not only when an armed attack
against Japan occurs but also when an armed attack against
a foreign country that is in a close relationship with Japan
occurs and as a result threatens Japan’s survival and
poses a clear danger to fundamentally overturn people’s
right to life, liberty and pursuit of happiness, and when
there is no other appropriate means available to repel the
attack and ensure Japan’s survival and protect its people,
use of force to the minimum extent necessary should
be interpreted to be permitted under the Constitution as
measures for self-defense in accordance with the basic
logic of the Government’s view to date.
As a matter of course, Japan’s “use of force” must be
carried out while observing international law. At the same
time, a legal basis in international law and constitutional
interpretation need to be understood separately. In certain
situations, the aforementioned “use of force” permitted
under the Constitution is, under international law, based

**3** **Basic Policy**


Under the Constitution, Japan has efficiently built a
highly effective and joint defense force in line with the
basic principles of maintaining an exclusively defense

on the right of collective self-defense. The Government
has reached a conclusion that although this “use of force”
includes those which are triggered by an armed attack
occurring against a foreign country, they are permitted
under the Constitution, only when they are taken as
measures for self-defense which are inevitable for
ensuring Japan’s survival and protecting its people, in
other words, for defending Japan.

**3 Geographic Boundaries within Which the**
**Right of Self-Defense May Be Exercised**


**Chapter**


The use of the minimum necessary force to defend Japan
under the right of self-defense is not necessarily confined
to the geographic boundaries of Japanese territory,
territorial waters, and airspace. However, it is difficult to
give a general definition of the actual extent to which it
may be used, as this would vary with the situation.
Nevertheless, the Government interprets that, as a
general rule, the Constitution does not permit armed
troops to be dispatched to the land, sea, or airspace of
other countries with the aim of using force; such overseas
deployment of troops would exceed the definition of the
minimum necessary level for self-defense.

**4 Right of Belligerency**


Article 9, Paragraph 2 of the Constitution prescribes
that “the right of belligerency of the state will not be
recognized.” However, the “right of belligerency” does
not mean the right to engage in battle; rather, it is a
general term for various rights that a belligerent nation
has under international law, including the authority to
inflict casualties and damage upon the enemy’s military
force and to occupy enemy territory.
On the other hand, Japan may of course use the
minimum level of force necessary to defend itself. For
example, if Japan inflicts casualties and damage upon
the enemy’s military force in exercising its right of
self-defense, this is conceptually distinguished from
the exercise of the right of belligerency, even though
those actions do not appear to be different. Occupation
of enemy territory, however, is not permissible because
it would exceed the minimum necessary level for selfdefense.

oriented policy and not becoming a military power that

**1 Exclusively Defense-Oriented Policy**


one under the former Constitution.[3] Civilian control aims
to ensure that the SDF is maintained and operated in
accordance with the will of the people.
The Diet, which represents Japanese nationals, makes
legislative and budgetary decisions on such matters
as the allotted number of the SDF personnel and main
organizations of the Ministry of Defense (MOD)/SDF.
It also issues approval for defense operations of the
SDF. The function of national defense entirely falls
under the executive power of the Cabinet as a general
administrative function. The Constitution requires that
the Prime Minister and other Ministers of State who
constitute the Cabinet be civilians. The Prime Minister,
on behalf of the whole Cabinet, holds the authority of
supreme command and supervision of the SDF. The
Minister of Defense, who is exclusively in charge of
national defense, exercises general control and supervises
over the SDF duties. In addition, the National Security
Council of Japan under the Cabinet deliberates important
matters on national security.
At the MOD, the Minister of Defense takes charge of
and manages the matters concerning national defense,
and as the competent minister also manages and operates
the SDF. The Minister of Defense is assisted in policy
planning and political affairs by the State Minister of
Defense, the Parliamentary Vice-Ministers of Defense
(two) and the Senior Adviser to the Minister of Defense.
In addition, the Special Adviser to the Minister of
Defense provides the Minister of Defense with advice on
important affairs under the jurisdiction of the MOD based
on their expertise and experience. The Defense Council
consisting of political appointees, civilian officials and
uniformed SDF personnel deliberates on basic principles
concerning affairs under the Ministry’s jurisdiction.
Through these ways, the MOD aims to further ensure
civilian control.
As mentioned above, the civilian control system is well
established. However, in order to ensure that the system
achieves good results, it is necessary to continue making
practical efforts in both political and administrative
aspects, along with a deep interest in national defense
taken by the people.

See Chapter 3, Section 1 (National Security Council), p. 220

Chapter 3, Section 2-1-2 (Systems to Support the Minister of
Defense), p. 221


The exclusively defense-oriented policy means that
defensive force is used only in the event of an attack,
that the extent of the use of defensive force is kept to the
minimum necessary for self-defense, and that the defense
capabilities to be possessed and maintained by Japan are
limited to the minimum necessary for self-defense. The
policy including these matters refers to the posture of a
passive defense strategy in accordance with the spirit of
the Constitution.

**2 Not Becoming a Military Power**


**Chapter**


There is no established definition for the concept of
a military power. For Japan, however, not becoming a
military power that could threaten other countries means
that Japan will not possess and maintain a military
capability strong enough to pose a threat to other countries,
beyond the minimum necessary for self-defense.

**3 Non-Nuclear Principles**


The Three Non-Nuclear Principles refers to those of not
possessing nuclear weapons, not producing them, and not
allowing them to be brought into Japan. Japan adheres
to the Three Non-Nuclear Principles as a fixed line of
national policy.
Japan is also prohibited from manufacturing and
possessing nuclear weapons under the Atomic Energy
Basic Law.[1] In addition, Japan ratified the Treaty on
the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons (NPT), and
as a nonnuclear weapons state, has an obligation not to
manufacture and acquire nuclear weapons.[2]

**4 Securing Civilian Control**


Civilian control refers to the priority of politics to the
military in a democratic state or democratic political
control of military strength. Japan has, by giving serious
reflection to the regrettable state of affairs that happened
until the end of World War II, adopted the following strict
civilian control system that is entirely different from the


Article 2 of the Atomic Energy Basic Law states that “The research, development and utilization of atomic energy shall be limited to peaceful purposes, aimed at ensuring safety and performed
independently under democratic management.”

Article 2 of the NPT states that “Each non-nuclear-weapon State Party to the Treaty undertakes...not to manufacture or otherwise acquire nuclear weapons or other nuclear explosive devices...”

Concerning the strengthening of Japan’s defense
force, Japan will build a Multi-Domain Defense Force

fulfill the roles described in Fig. II-2-2-2 (Roles to Be
Fulfilled by Defense Force) during peacetime seamlessly
and in a combined manner.

See Fig. II-2-2-2 (Roles to Be Fulfilled by Defense Force)

**3 Strengthening the Japan-U.S. Alliance**


From the perspective of “Proactive Contribution to
Peace,” Japan has enhanced its diplomatic strength and
defense capability. Japan has also promoted cooperative
relationships with other countries, with the Japan-U.S.
Alliance being a cornerstone. In so doing, Japan under
the Constitution has adhered to the basic precept of
maintaining the exclusively defense-oriented policy and
not becoming a military power that poses a threat to
other countries, ensured civilian control of the military,
and observed the Three Non-Nuclear Principles. Japan
will ever not change the course it has taken to date as a
peace-loving nation. Based on this premise, Japan, even
amid the realities of a security environment it has hitherto
never faced, must strive to preserve national interests—
defend to the end Japanese nationals’ lives, persons and
property, territorial land, waters and airspace, and its
sovereignty and independence.
Defense objectives are to create a desirable security
environment while deterring threats from reaching,
and, should a threat reach Japan, to counter the threat.
As means of achieving these objectives, Japan will
strengthen: (1) Japan’s own architecture for national
defense; (2) the Japan-U.S. Alliance; and (3) international
security cooperation. These efforts, including achieving
superiority in new domains, which are space, cyberspace,
and electromagnetic spectrum, must be carried out swiftly
and flexibly.
In dealing with the threat of nuclear weapons, U.S.
extended deterrence, with nuclear deterrence at its core,
is essential: Japan will closely cooperate with the United
States. To deal with the threat, Japan will also increase
its own efforts. At the same time, Japan will play an
active and positive role in nuclear disarmament and nonproliferation.

**2 Strengthening Japan’s Own Architecture for**
**National Defense**


**Chapter**


The Japan-U.S. Security Arrangements constitute a
cornerstone for Japan’s national security, and the JapanU.S. Alliance plays a significant role for the peace,
stability and prosperity of the international community.
In this context, Japan needs to press ahead with such
efforts as bolstering the ability of the Japan-U.S. Alliance
to deter and counter threats, enhancing and expanding
cooperation in a wide range of areas, and steadily
implementing measures concerning the stationing of U.S.
Forces in Japan.

**4 Strengthening Security Cooperation**


In line with the vision of a “Free and Open Indo-Pacific,”
Japan will strategically promote multifaceted and
multilayered security cooperation, taking into account
the characteristics and situation specific to each region
and country. As part of such efforts, Japan will actively
leverage its defense capability to work on defense
cooperation and exchanges which include bilateral/
multilateral training and exercises, defense equipment
and technology cooperation, capacity building assistance,
and service-to-service exchanges. Furthermore, Japan
will also contribute to address global security challenges.
Moreover, in implementing these initiatives, Japan will
position the Japan-U.S. Alliance as its cornerstone and
will work closely with the countries that share universal
values and security interests, through full coordination
with its diplomatic policy.


In order to securely achieve national defense objectives,
Japan will build a national defense architecture that
will, in all phases, integrate the strengths at the nation’s

|Capabilities in maritime and air domains|● The SDF will reinforce its posture for conducting persistent ISR at sea and in the air around Japan. ● The SDF will also strengthen surface and underwater operational capabilities including Unmanned Underwater Vehicles (UUV). ● By taking measures such as developing a fighter force structure that features Short Take-Off and Vertical Landing (STOVL) fighter aircraft, the SDF will improve air operation capability particularly on the Pacific side of Japan, where number of air bases is limited despite its vast airspace. ● Japan will take necessary measures to enable STOVL fighter aircraft to operate from existing SDF ships as required.|
|Stand-off defense capability|● The SDF will acquire stand-off firepower and other requisite capabilities to deal with ships and landing forces attempting to invade Japan including remote islands from the outside of their threat envelopes. ● In order to appropriately leverage advances in military technologies, Japan will swiftly and flexibly strengthen stand-off defense capability through measures such as comprehensive research and development of related technologies.|
|Comprehensive air and missile defense capability|● In order to counter diverse airborne threats of ballistic and cruise missiles and aircraft, the SDF will establish a structure with which to conduct integrated operation of various equipment pieces, thereby providing persistent nation-wide protection and also enhancing the capability to simultaneously deal with multiple, complex airborne threats. The SDF will also study ways to counter future airborne threats.|
|Maneuver and deployment capability|● Requisite SDF units need to conduct sustained, persistent activities in appropriate areas on a steady-state basis. In order to maneuver and deploy according to situation, the SDF will strengthen amphibious operation and other capabilities. ● To enable swift and large-scale transport, the SDF will strengthen joint transport capability including inter- and intra-theater transport capabilities tailored to the characteristics of remote island areas. The SDF will also work to collaborate with commercial transport on a steady-state basis.|
|Sustainability and resiliency|● The SDF will take necessary measures for securing ammunition and fuel, ensuring maritime shipping lanes, and protecting important infrastructure. In particular, while cooperating with relevant ministries and agencies, the SDF will improve sustainability through safe and steady acquisition and stockpiling of ammunition and fuel. ● The SDF will also improve resiliency in a multi-layered way through efforts including dispersion, recovery from damage, and substitution of infrastructure and other foundations for SDF operations. Further, the SDF will review existing equipment maintenance methods, thereby ensuring high operational availability.|

which deliberates on basic principles concerning affairs
under the Ministry’s jurisdiction. Furthermore, there are the
Administrative Vice-Minister of Defense, who organizes
and supervises the administrative affairs of each bureau
and organization to support the Minister of Defense, and
the Vice-Minister of Defense for International Affairs,
who is responsible for the overall coordination of duties
such as those related to international affairs.
Moreover, the Internal Bureaus of the MOD, Joint
Staff, Ground Staff Office, Maritime Staff Office, Air
Staff Office, and the Acquisition, Technology & Logistics
Agency (ATLA), as an external bureau, have been
established in the MOD. The Internal Bureaus of the MOD
are responsible for basic policy relating to the duties of the
SDF. The Director-General of the Minister’s Secretariat
and the Directors-General of each Bureau within the
Internal Bureaus, along with the Commissioner of ATLA
who is in charge of defense equipment administration,
support the Minister of Defense by providing assistance
from a policy perspective.
The Joint Staff is a staff organization for the Minister of
Defense concerning the operation of the SDF. The Chief of
Joint Staff provides centralized support for the operations
of the SDF for the Minister of Defense from a military
expert’s perspective. The Ground Staff, Maritime Staff
and Air Staff are the staff organizations for the Minister
of Defense concerning their respective services except
operations of the SDF, with the Chiefs of Staff for the
Ground Self-Defense Force (GSDF), the Maritime Self

Defense Force (MSDF) and the Air Self-Defense Force
(ASDF) acting as the top ranking expert advisers to the
Minister of Defense regarding these services.
In this manner, the MOD has ensured that the support
for the Minister from a policy perspective and the support
for the Minister from a military expert’s perspective
are provided in a well-balanced manner like the two
wheels of a cart, so to speak, in order for the Minister of
Defense to appropriately make decisions. To make this
concept even more explicit, Article 12 of the Ministry
of Defense Establishment Act was amended to stipulate
that the support for the Minister of Defense provided
by the Director-General of the Minister’s Secretariat
and the Directors-General of each Bureau as well as the
Commissioner of ATLA shall be conducted in cooperation
with the support for the Minister by each Chief of Staff,
when said Act was amended in 2015.[2]

The Government has made replies regarding civilian control and the role of the civilian officials in the Internal Bureaus during the Diet deliberations on the Amendment Act, stating: “Civilian control
means prioritizing politics over the military in democratic countries. Civilian control in our country consists of control by the Diet, control by the Cabinet (including the National Security Council), and
control within the MOD. Control within the MOD means that the Minister of Defense, a civilian, manages, operates, and controls the SDF. In addition to support from political appointees, such as the
State Minister of Defense and Parliamentary Vice-Ministers of Defense, support from civilian officials in the Internal Bureaus also plays an important role in aiding the exercise of civilian control by
the Minister of Defense. The role of civilian officials in the Internal Bureaus in civilian control is to support the Minister of Defense, and there is no relationship in which civilian officials of the Internal

toward building an architecture that is capable of realizing
cross-domain operations including new domains, which
are space, cyberspace, and electromagnetic spectrum.

executed by the Chief of Joint Staff. In doing this, the
Minister’s commands and orders are delivered through
the Chief of Joint Staff not only in cases where a joint
task force[3] is organized, but also in cases where a
single SDF unit is employed to respond.

The Joint Staff undertakes functions relating to the

In order to realize cross-domain operations, the Joint
Staff’s posture designed for efficient SDF operations and
for new domains will be strengthened, thereby enabling
swift and effective exercise of the SDF’s total capabilities.
In addition, the future framework for joint operations will
be examined.


**2 Strengthening Joint Operational Functions**

**(1) Past Initiatives**
In order to ensure the accuracy of decision-making
relating to the operations of the SDF and to make
the process swifter, in October 2015, the Bureau of
Operational Policy was abolished and some of its
functions, such as the planning and drafting of laws and
regulations relating to unit operations, were transferred
to the Bureau of Defense Policy in order to unite affairs
concerning actual operations of the units into the Joint
Staff. This change has made the Joint Staff assume work
that the Internal Bureaus had previously conducted,
such as external explanations, including replies at the
Diet, and communication and coordination with related
ministries and governmental agencies. Regarding this

1 Defense-related expenditures for FY2020 include expenditures to be transferred to the Cabinet Secretariat and the Digital Agency (tentative name).

2 Some projects for build-up of defense capabilities extend over multiple years. In these cases, the fiscal year in which the contract is concluded is different from the fiscal year in which the payment
to the contractor is made. Therefore, the future maximum obligation is allocated to the budget as a contract resulting in a Treasury obligation (type of budget that only grants an authority to incur
obligations; the contracts can be concluded, but the payment cannot be made). Based on such budgeting, in the fiscal year in which the construction is completed or the equipment is procured,
expenses necessary for payment are allocated as budget expenditure, in principle (type of budget that grants authorities to incur obligations and make payment; the contracts can be concluded and
the payment can be made). Budget expenditure for payments incurred under contracts concluded in previous fiscal years is called “obligatory outlay expenses,” while expenditure for future fiscal
years is termed “future obligation.”

For cases where a continued project over multiple years is necessary, there is also a system of continuing expenditure as a means to grant the authority to incur obligations and make payment over

material expenses include repair costs for equipment,
education and training expenses for personnel, and the
purchase of fuel, they are referred to also as “activity
expenses.” The MOD terms this classification method as
“classification by expenses.”
Personnel and food provision expenses as well as
obligatory outlay expenses, both of which are mandatory
expenses, account for 80% of the total defense-related
budget. The remaining 20% of the budget includes
spending for repairing equipment and for implementing
measures to alleviate the impact on local communities
hosting U.S. bases in Japan. As such, a high percentage
of the budget is allocated for maintenance purposes.
For this reason, the breakdown of the defense-related
expenditures cannot be easily altered in a significant
manner on a single-year basis.

See Fig. II-4-2-3 (Relationship between Annual Expenditure and

See

Future Obligation Concerning New Contracts)

Personnel and food provision expenses were increased
by 49.3 billion yen from the previous fiscal year and
obligatory outlay expenses for the year increased by 4.1
billion yen. Also general material expenses increased by
1.4 billion yen from the previous fiscal year.[3]

See Fig. II-4-2-4 (Breakdown of Defense-Related Expenditures

See


[Initial Budget] [FY2021])
Reference 8 (Changes in Composition of Defense-Related
Expenditures [Initial Budget])


In addition to the annual budget expenditure, the
amount of future obligations concerning new contracts
also indicates payments for the following year and beyond
(the amount of future obligation arising in the applicable
fiscal year). In the build-up of defense capabilities, it is
common to take multiple years from contract to delivery
or completion, in areas such as the procurement of
vessels, aircraft, and other primary equipment, as well
as the construction of buildings such as aircraft hangars
and barracks. Consequently, for such items, a procedure
is undertaken whereby a multi-year contract is arranged,
and it is promised in advance at the time of the contract
that payments will be made in the following fiscal year
and beyond (within five years, in principle). The sum of
money to be paid in the following fiscal year and beyond,
based on such a multi-year contract, is called the amount
of future obligation. The amount of future obligation
concerning new contracts arising in FY2021 increased
from the previous fiscal year by 4.0 billion yen (0.2%).
Furthermore, if looked at on a contract basis,[4] which
shows the scale of operations, there is an increase from
the previous fiscal year of 5.4 billion yen (0.2%).

Amount of future obligation

When improving defense capabilities, it is common for work in areas like the procurement of equipment and
the upgrading of facilities to be carried out over several years. Consequently, a procedure is undertaken
whereby a contract that extends for multiple years is arranged (five years in principle), and the government
promises in advance at the time of the agreement to make the payment at a fixed time in the future.
Future obligation refers to the sum of money to be paid in the following year and beyond under such

**3** **Initiatives for Increasing the Efficiency of Procurement**


In order to achieve further streamlining and rationalization,
the MTDP sets forth that the MOD will work to secure
substantial financial resources through suspension of the
use of equipment whose importance has decreased, review
of projects of low cost-effectiveness, and optimization
of equipment procurement such as thoroughgoing cost
management and control and efficient procurement
including long-term contracts.
In the FY2021 budget, the MOD aims to realize a
cost reduction of approximately 416.8 billion yen by
implementing these streamlining measures. Concrete
initiatives introduced in the FY2021 budget are as follows.

-  Reduction of approximately 206.8 billion yen through
project review, including suspension of the use of
equipment of lowered priority



-  Reduction of approximately 28.8 billion yen through
communalization and optimization of specifications,
including use of convertible modules and civilian goods

-  Reduction of approximately 38.1 billion yen through
efficiency improvement by bulk procurement and joint
procurement

-  Reduction of approximately 10.4 billion yen through
making use of long-term contracts that run over five years

-  Reduction of approximately 132.7 billion yen through
scrutiny of prices and related costs of equipment
The MOD will also auction off decommissioned
goods and open the remains of the Imperial Headquarters
bunker to the public with an admission fee as means of
securing revenues.

It is not possible to accurately compare the amounts of
defense expenditures of countries due to a number of
factors: there is no internationally unified definition of
defense expenditures in the first place; even if defense
expenditures were publicly disclosed, their overall
amount or their breakdown is sometimes unclear; and the
budget system varies by country.
On such basis, if Japan’s defense-related expenditures
and those of other countries officially published by each
government were converted into dollar amounts, using
the purchasing power parity[5] of each country reported
by the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and
Development (OECD), the results would be as shown
in Fig. II-4-2-5 (The Defense Expenditures of Major
Countries [FY2020]). Compared to the other G7
countries, as well as Australia and the Republic of Korea,
Japan’s defense-related expenditures as a percentage of
GDP rank the lowest.

country published by the IMF (in local currency).

3. As defense expenditures published by NATO (which include pensions for retired
veterans, etc.) may differ from those officially published by each country, the
percentage of GDP based on defense expenditures published by NATO (in March
2021) does not necessarily coincide with the percentage of GDP calculated based
on defense expenditures officially published by each country.

The law sets forth the following measures in order to avoid
integration with the use of force by a foreign country and
also to ensure the safety of the SDF personnel:

-  The SDF does not conduct activities in “the scene
where a combat is actually taking place.” Regarding
search and rescue operations, however, when stranded
personnel have been located and rescue operations
have commenced, the SDF units are allowed to
continue search and rescue activities as long as the
safety of these units is ensured.

-  The commanding officers, etc., of the SDF units order
the temporary suspension of activities, etc., if combat
operations occur or are expected to occur at the site of
their activities or in the vicinity.

-  The Minister of Defense designates the area for
implementing activities, and if it is deemed difficult to
implement operations smoothly and safely in the whole
or part of that area, the Minister must promptly change
the designation of the area or order the cessation of the
activities being implemented there.

“Situations that will have an important influence” refers to situations that will have an important influence on Japan’s peace and security, including situations that, if left without response, could lead
to a direct armed attack on Japan

Operations to inspect and confirm the cargo and destination of ships (excluding warships and others) and to request, if necessary, a change of sea route, or destination port or place, for the purpose

**Armed Attack**


as an armed attack, the Minister of Defense can take the
following measures:
(1) If the Minister of Defense judges that ballistic
missiles or other objects are likely to fly to Japan
and that it is necessary to prevent damage to human
lives and property due to its fall in the territory of
Japan, the Minister, upon the approval of the Prime
Minister, can order the SDF units to take measures to
destroy the ballistic missiles or other objects actually
flying to the country in the airspace over the territory
of Japan or the high seas.
(2) In addition to the cases of (1) above, there may be
cases where the situation suddenly changes with little
information available on the launch, for example, and
the Minister of Defense cannot have time to obtain
approval from the Prime Minister. In preparation for
such cases, the Minister of Defense may create an
emergency response manual beforehand and obtain
approval from the Prime Minister. Following the
emergency response manual, the Minister of Defense
can order, for a specified period of time, the SDF
units to take measures to destroy ballistic missiles
or other objects in the airspace over the territory of
Japan or the high seas when such objects are actually
flying to the country.

**5 Measures against Intrusion of Territorial**
**Airspace**


**1 Public Security Operations**

**(1) Public Security Operations by Order**
In the event of an indirect aggression or another emergency
situation, the Prime Minister can order the whole or
part of the SDF to deploy if it is deemed impossible to
maintain public security with the general police force. In
this instance, in principle, the Prime Minister must bring
the order to the Diet for deliberation, and request for its
approval within twenty days from the day the order has
been given.


**(2) Public Security Operations by Request**
Upon consulting with the Public Safety Commission of
the prefecture concerned, the governor of that prefecture
can request the Prime Minister to dispatch units, etc., of
the SDF if it is deemed unavoidable as the situation will
have a serious influence on public security. Following
such a request, the Prime Minister can order the SDF to
mobilize when a situation calls for such action.

Guerillas, Special Operations Forces and Others), p. 271

**2 Maritime Security Operations**


**Chapter**


When there is a special need to protect lives or property
or maintain public security at sea, the Minister of Defense
can order the SDF units to take necessary actions at sea
upon approval by the Prime Minister.

See Part III, Chapter 1, Section 1-3 (Measures against Violation of

See

Japan’s Sovereignty), p. 253

**3 Counter-Piracy Operations**


The Minister of Defense may order SDF units to take
necessary measures to make intruding aircraft land or
withdraw from the territorial airspace of Japan (guiding
intruders away, issuing radio transmission warnings,
use of weapons, etc.) when a foreign aircraft intrudes
Japan’s territorial airspace in violation of international
law, the provisions of the Aviation Law or other relevant
laws and regulations.

Article 76 of the SDF Law
(Issuance of Defense Operations Orders)


Concept of ensuring civilian control of the military

-  Response against ballistic missiles requires the government to assess the possibility of missiles flying toward Japan by comprehensively analyzing and evaluating
the specific situation and international circumstances. In addition to the SDF destroying the missile, interagency actions are required, for example, measures for civil
protection such as alert and evacuation, diplomatic activities, information gathering by related agencies, and enhancement of readiness for emergencies.

-  In view of the importance of the matter and the necessity of action by the Japanese government as a whole, the Cabinet and Minister of Defense can sufficiently fulfill
their responsibilities upon the Prime Minister’s approval (Cabinet decision) and orders by the Minister of Defense. Furthermore, the supervision of the Diet is also defined
with a provision in the law stipulating reporting to the Diet.


people who need protection of their lives or bodies to a
safe place. Moreover, when their lives or bodies can be
harmed, upon a request from the Minister for Foreign
Affairs and after subsequent consultations between the
Minister for Foreign Affairs and the Minister of Defense,
as well as approval by the Prime Minister, the SDF
may conduct “rescue measures” that include guarding
and rescue of Japanese nationals, etc. if the following
requirements are satisfied.
a. It needs to be confirmed that in the areas where the
rescue measures are taken, the competent authorities
of the country concerned are maintaining public safety
and order at the time, and no act of combat will be
conducted;
b. The country concerned[10] consents to the SDF taking the
rescue measures (including the use of weapons); and
c. It is expected that coordination and cooperation can
be ensured between the units of the SDF and the
competent authority of the country concerned in order
to carry out the rescue measures as smoothly and
safely as possible in response to anticipated dangers.

Transport of Japanese Nationals Overseas, etc.), p. 299


**7 Protection of Weapons and Other Equipment**
**of the Units of the U.S. Forces and the Armed**
**Forces of Other Foreign Countries**

Based on Article 95-2 of the SDF Law, it has been
established that the SDF personnel may protect weapons
and other equipment of the units of the U.S. Forces and
the armed forces of other foreign countries actually
engaging in activities that contribute to the defense of
Japan in cooperation with the SDF.
The basic principles of the article and the Cabinet’s
involvement in its operation are provided by “The
Implementation Guidelines for Article 95-2 of the SelfDefense Forces Law”[11] decided by the National Security
Council. An outline of the guidelines is as follows:


**Chapter**


**(1) Purpose of Article 95-2**
Protection under this Article applies to weapons, etc. of
the units of the United States Forces, armed forces of
other foreign countries and other similar organizations
that are, in cooperation with the SDF, actually engaged
in activities that contribute to the defense of Japan
(including bilateral/multilateral exercises but excluding
activities in the scene where the combat activities are
actually being conducted). This Article is to enable SDF
personnel to carry out very passive and limited use of
weapons to the minimum extent necessary to protect
important material means which constitute the defense


10 It includes an organization, if any, that administers the said country in accordance with a resolution of the General Assembly or the Security Council of the UN.


-----

**(4) Involvement of the Cabinet**
Requests from the U.S. Forces, etc. should be deliberated
in the NSC before the Minister of Defense judges on
conducting protection if the Minister receives requests
in the following cases. However, in urgent cases, the
Minister should promptly report to the NSC.
(1) The U.S. Forces, etc. makes a request for the first
time.
(2) The request is made for protection in the territory of
a third country.
(3) The request is recognized as particularly important,
although not falling under the above two categories.
In addition, in case protection under the situations that
will have an important influence is requested, the Prime
Minister should clearly state it in the Basic Plan and
should ask for a Cabinet decision on it after deliberations
in the NSC.

See Part III, Chapter 1, Section 5-2 (Track Record of Protection of

Weapons and Other Equipment of the Units of the U.S. Forces
and the Armed Forces of Other Countries [SDF Law Article
95-2]), p. 301

**4** **Disaster Relief Dispatches and Others**

**1 Disaster Relief Dispatches** **2 Earthquake Disaster Prevention Dispatch**

**and Nuclear Disaster Relief Dispatch**

In principle, Disaster Relief Dispatch is conducted as


When a warning declaration is issued based on the Act
on Special Measures Concerning Countermeasures for
Large-Scale Earthquakes[13] or a declaration of a nuclear
emergency situation is issued based on the Act on Special
Measures Concerning Nuclear Emergency Preparedness,
the Minister of Defense is authorized to order dispatching
units upon a request of the Director of the Seismic
Disaster Warning Headquarters or the Director of the
Nuclear Disaster Countermeasures Headquarters (the
Prime Minister).

See Part III, Chapter 1, Section 4 (Response to Large-Scale Disasters,

etc. [Including response to COVID-19]), p. 291


capability of Japan from infringements which do not
amount to an armed attack.

**(2) Activities that Contribute to the Defense of Japan**
“Activities that contribute to the defense of Japan” include
mainly the following ones, while the Government of
Japan is to examine each activity on a case-by-case basis:
(1) intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance (ISR)
activities including ballistic missile alert; (2) transportation
and replenishment activities in situations that will have an
important influence on Japan’s peace and security; and
(3) bilateral/multilateral exercises to enhance capabilities
required for defending Japan.


**(3) Judgment on Whether or Not to Conduct Protection**
When the Minister of Defense receives a request from
the U.S. Forces, etc., the Minister subjectively should
judge whether the relevant activities are “activities that
contribute to the defense of Japan” and whether protection
is necessary, by considering the objective and content
of the activities, capability of the unit, and surrounding
circumstances as well as the impacts on performance of
the SDF’s regular operations.

**4** **Disaster Relief Dispatches and Others**

**1 Disaster Relief Dispatches**

In principle, Disaster Relief Dispatch is conducted as
follows: prefectural governors or other officials ask the
Minister of Defense, or an officer designated by the
Minister, to dispatch the SDF units, etc., in the event of
a natural disaster; the Minister or the designated officer
will make a judgement based on a comprehensive
consideration of three conditions (urgency, lack of
alternatives, public good) and dispatch the units if it is
deemed necessary for the SDF to respond to the disaster.[12]
This procedure is based on the idea that prefectural
governors and other officials should grasp the overall
conditions of the disaster and their own disaster relief
capabilities first, and then decide whether to make a
request for the SDF disaster relief dispatch.


**Chapter**


12 The Commandant of the Japan Coast Guard, the Director General of the Regional Coast Guard Headquarters, and the Director of the Airport Administrative Office may request a disaster relief dispatch.
With regard to disaster relief dispatch, earthquake disaster prevention dispatch, and nuclear disaster relief dispatch, (1) SDF personnel ordered for the dispatch may take measures such as evacuation
(Article 4 of the Police Duties Execution Law) based on Article 94 of the SDF Law (Authority in Disaster Relief Dispatch, etc.); (2) SDF Reserve Personnel and SDF Ready Reserve Personnel may be
called up for service in the event of disaster relief dispatch, and SDF Ready Personnel in the event of earthquake disaster prevention dispatch or nuclear disaster relief dispatch; and (3) special units
may be temporarily formed as necessary.

13 The Prime Minister issues an earthquake alert with the endorsement of the Cabinet in the event that an earthquake prediction was reported by the Director-General of the Japan Meteorological Agency

**5** **Framework for Contributing to the Peace and Stability of the International Community**


While the provision of weapons is not included as
in the Law Concerning Measures to Ensure the Peace
and Security of Japan in Situations that Will Have an
Important Influence on Japan’s Peace and Security, the
revised law now allows the “provision of ammunition”
and “refueling and maintenance of aircraft ready to take
off for combat operations.”
b. Search and Rescue Activities
c. Ship Inspection Operations[16] (Those Set Forth in the
Ship Inspection Operations Law)

**(3) Measures to Avoid Integration with the Use of Force**
The following measures are set forth in order to avoid
integration with the use of force by a foreign country and
also to ensure the safety of SDF personnel:

-  Japan does not implement support activities in
the scene where a combat is actually taking place.
However, when the personnel having been stranded
have already been found and rescue operations have
commenced, the SDF units are allowed to continue
search and rescue activities concerning them as long
as the safety of these units is ensured.

-  The commanding officers of the SDF units, etc., order
a temporary suspension of support activities if combat
operations occur or are expected to occur at the site of
their activities or in the vicinity.

-  The Minister of Defense designates the area for
implementing activities, and if it is deemed difficult to
implement operations smoothly and safely in the whole
or part of that area, the Minister must promptly change
the designation of the area or order the cessation of the
activities being implemented there.


**1 Response to Situations Threatening**
**the International Peace and Security that**
**the International Community Is Collectively**
**Addressing**

Under the International Peace Support Act,[14] in order to
ensure peace and security of the international community,
Japan is allowed to conduct cooperation and support
operations for the armed forces of foreign countries
engaged in operations for international peace and security
in Situations Threatening the International Peace and
Security that the International Community is Collectively
Addressing.[15] From the perspective of enabling seamless
responses to any situation, the International Peace Support
Law, enacted as a general law, enables Japan to conduct
operations more expeditiously and effectively, making it
possible to proactively contribute to international peace
and security on Japan’s own initiative.


**(1) Requirements**
The requirement for Japan to offer cooperation and
support to the operations of foreign armed forces is the
issuance of one of the following UN resolutions (by the
General Assembly or the Security Council).
a. Resolutions that decide, call upon, recommend or
authorize the country, which is subject to Japan’s
support operations to respond to situations that threaten
the peace and security of the international community
b. Other than (a), resolutions that regard the situations
as a threat to peace or a breach of peace and call on
United Nations (UN) member states to respond to the
situations concerned

**(2) Response Measures**
The following response measures can be implemented in
situations threatening the international peace and security
that the international community is collectively addressing.
a. Cooperation and Support Activities
Supplies and services to armed forces of foreign countries
(supply, transportation, repair and maintenance, medical
services, communications, airport and seaport services,
base services, lodging, storage, use of facilities, training
services and construction) are to be provided.


**Chapter**


**2 International Peace Cooperation Activities**

The International Peace Cooperation Act[17] is aimed at
enabling active contribution by Japan to international
peace efforts centering upon the United Nations. It
is to set forth a framework for the Implementation of
International Peace Cooperation Assignments, with a
view to extending appropriate and prompt cooperation for
efforts such as United Nations Peacekeeping Operations[18]
and Internationally Coordinated Operations for Peace and

about three weeks from mid-March 2019) have conducted surveillance activities with aircraft using the United States Kadena Air Base in Japan (as of March 2021).

At the Japan-Canada summit meeting held on April 28, 2019, Justin Trudeau, Prime Minister of Canada, indicated that Canada will extend the period for dispatch of aircraft and vessels for conducting
monitoring and surveillance activities against ship-to-ship transfers of cargo by two years, and Prime Minister Shinzo Abe expressed his gratitude.

extending to not only the East China Sea, but also the
Pacific Ocean and the Sea of Japan.
As a distinctive example of Chinese aircraft recently,
a situation arose in May 2017 when an object that
looked like a small drone caused an airspace violation
as it flew above a China Coast Guard vessel entering
Japanese territorial waters near the Senkaku Islands.
Japan lodged protests against the Chinese government
through diplomatic channels. In August that year, six
Chinese military bombers were observed in a flight from
the East China Sea over the main island of Okinawa and
Miyakojima Island northeast across the Pacific to an area
off the Kii Peninsula before returning. Then in December,
five aircraft including two fighter jets flew over the
Tsushima Strait and entered the Japan Sea airspace.[9] In
April 2018, a (presumed) unmanned Chinese aircraft
flew across the East China Sea.
Furthermore, in July 2019, two Chinese H-6 bombers
and two Russian Tu-95 bombers conducted a joint longrange flight from the Sea of Japan to the East China
Sea. Additionally, in December 2020, four Chinese H-6
bombers and two Russian Tu-95 bombers ran a joint
long-range flight from the Sea of Japan to the East China
Sea and the Pacific Ocean.
In addition, aircraft conducting flights that could be
considered as some form of training and/or information
gathering activities have been confirmed in the airspace
around Japan.
In this way, China is continuing to expand and intensify
the activities of its air force in airspace around Japan and


**1 Warnings and Scrambles in Preparation**
**against Intrusion of Territorial Airspace**

**(1) Basic Concept**
Under international law, countries have complete and
exclusive sovereignty over their territorial airspace.
Scrambling against aircraft intruding into territorial
airspace is conducted as an act to exercise the right
of policing intended to maintain public order. Unlike
measures taken on land or at sea, this measure can be
taken only by the SDF. Therefore, the ASDF is primarily
responsible for conducting the actions based on the
provisions of Article 84 of the SDF Law.


**Chapter**


**(2) Response by the MOD/SDF**
The ASDF detects and identifies aircraft flying in
airspace surrounding Japan using warning and control
radars as well as early warning and control aircraft. If
any suspicious aircraft heading to Japan’s territorial
airspace are detected, fighters and other aircraft scramble
to approach them in order to confirm the situation and
monitor the aircraft as necessary. Furthermore, in the
event that this suspicious aircraft has actually intruded
into territorial airspace, a warning to leave the airspace
would be issued, among other responses.
In FY2020, ASDF aircraft scrambled 725 times.
Breaking this figure down, planes scrambled 458 times
in response to Chinese aircraft.
Flight patterns of Chinese military aircraft in recent
years have changed, and now their range of activities are

one-sidedly escalating its actions in some cases. This
situation raises a serious concern.
ASDF aircraft scrambled 258 times in response to
Russian aircraft.
As a distinctive example, in June 2019, two Tu95 bombers intruded into Japan’s airspace above the
territorial waters of Minamidaitojima Island (Okinawa
Prefecture). One of them further intruded into Japan’s
airspace above the territorial waters of Hachijojima
Island (Tokyo). Japan lodged protests against the Russian
government through diplomatic channels.
In July 2019, two Chinese H-6 bombers and two
Russian Tu-95 bombers carried out long distance joint
flights from the Sea of Japan to the East China Sea. In
addition, one Russian A-50 early warning and control
aircraft allegedly supporting Tu-95 bombers intruded
into Japan’s airspace above the territorial waters of
Takeshima Island in Shimane Prefecture. A Korean fighter
fired warning shots to the Russian aircraft. Japan lodged
protests against the Russian government which intruded
into Japan’s airspace and against the Korean government
which fired warning shots to the Russian aircraft through
diplomatic channel.
In October 2020, a Mi-8 helicopter intruded into


the Russian government through diplomatic channels.
In December 2020, four Chinese H-6 bombers and two
Russian Tu-95 bombers conducted a joint long-range
flight from the Sea of Japan to the East China Sea and the
Pacific Ocean.
Due attention needs to be paid to the activities of
Russian aircraft.
Even after the establishment of the “East China Sea
Air Defense Identification Zone (ADIZ)” by the Chinese
Government in November 2013, the MOD/SDF has
conducted monitoring and surveillance activities as
before in the East China Sea, including the Chinese
ADIZ. The MOD/SDF also engages in strict measures
against intrusion of territorial airspace in accordance
with international law and the SDF Law, as well as
keep conducting thorough monitoring and surveillance
activities in the air and sea areas around Japan.

In January 2018, a submerged submarine was spotted
by MSDF assets including a destroyer moving through
Japanese contiguous zones of the Senkaku Islands. The
submarine was then observed surfacing in international
waters of the East China Sea flying the Chinese flag. In
the past, submerged submarines moving through Japanese
contiguous zones were spotted in other sea areas.[11] This
was the first time that a Chinese naval submarine has been


observed operating in the Japanese contiguous zones of
the Senkaku Islands.
Furthermore, in June 2020 it was confirmed that
a submarine presumed to be Chinese was navigating
through the Japanese contiguous zones in waters around
Amami Oshima Island, and necessary information
gathering and surveillance operations were carried out by
the MSDF, etc.

**(2) Response by the MOD/SDF**
In light of the lessons learned from the cases of an
unidentified vessel off the Noto Peninsula in 1999, an
unidentified vessel in the sea southwest of Kyushu in
2001, and other similar incidents, the MOD/SDF have
been making various efforts.
In particular, the MSDF has been taking the following
steps: (1) deployment of Patrol Guided Missile Boats;
(2) establishment of the MSDF Special Boarding
Unit;[12] (3) equipment of destroyers with machine guns;
(4) furnishing forcible maritime interdiction equipment
(flat-nose shells);[13] (5) improving the sufficiency ratio of
military vessel personnel; and (6) enhancing equipment
for the Vessel Boarding Inspection Team. In addition,
based on “the manual for dealing with suspicious vessels”
formulated jointly by the then Defense Agency and the
Japan Coast Guard in 1999, they have regularly conducted
the training in order to strengthen coordination.

**in the Middle East**


the Middle East, the Japanese Government has actively
promoted diplomatic initiatives, including Prime Minister
Abe’s visit to Iran in the same month, and the Japan-U.S.
summit meeting during the UN General Assembly and
the Japan-Iran summit meeting in September.
In this context, as a result of discussions that took place
between the Prime Minister and other relevant ministers
at the National Security Council and other meetings,
Japan’s own initiative to ensure peace and stability in the
Middle East and the safety of Japan-related vessels is as
follows: (1) further diplomatic efforts to ease tensions in
the Middle East and stabilize the situation; (2) thorough
implementation of navigation safety measures, including
close information sharing with relevant industries; and
(3) conduct information gathering activities via the use
of SDF assets. In December, the Cabinet approved them
as the government’s policy for governmental efforts to


International law does not prohibit foreign submarines
from navigating through the contiguous zones in the
waters of coastal countries, but Japan maintains a posture
to appropriately respond to these types of activities.

**3 Response to Armed Special Operations Vessels**


**(1) Basic Concept**
The Japan Coast Guard, as a police organization, is
primarily responsible for responding to suspicious
armed special operations vessels (unidentified vessels).
However, in the event that it is deemed extremely difficult
or impossible for the Japan Coast Guard to respond to a
situation, an order for maritime security operations will
be issued and the situation will be handled by the SDF in
cooperation with the Japan Coast Guard.

**1 Background of the Deployment of the SDF to**
**the Middle East**


**Chapter**


Peace and stability in the Middle East are crucial to the
peace and prosperity of the international community,
including Japan. In addition, it is very important to ensure
the safety of Japan-related vessels in the Middle East,
which is the world’s major energy source and on which
Japan depends for about 90% of its crude oil imports.
In the Middle East, amidst rising tensions, there were
incidents of attacks on ships. In June 2019, Japan-related
vessels suffered damage. Under these circumstances, the
United States, European countries, and other countries
are taking steps to ensure the safety of navigation in the
region by utilizing ships and aircraft.
In order to ease tensions and stabilize the situation in

ensure the safety of Japan-related vessels.
For these information gathering activities, in addition
to the dispatch of a destroyer as a surface force, two P-3C
patrol aircraft of the Deployment Air Force for Counter
Piracy Enforcement (DAPE) will be utilized to the extent
that it does not interfere with the counter-piracy missions.
The area of operation includes three waters of high seas:
the Gulf of Oman, the northern Arabian Sea and the Gulf
of Aden to the east of the Bab el-Mandeb Strait (including
the exclusive economic zones of the coastal states).
Information gathered by the SDF is shared with the
Cabinet Secretariat, the Ministry of Land, Infrastructure,
Transport and Tourism (MLIT), MOFA, and other
relevant ministries and agencies, as well as with relevant
industries through public-private liaison meetings, to be
used for the government’s navigation safety measures.

**2 The SDF’s Activities**


**Chapter**


Destroyer JS “Suzunami” engaging in information gathering activities in the northern part
of the Arabian Sea

a. Deployment Surface Force for Information Gathering
Activities
Operates in the high seas of the Gulf of Oman and in the
high seas of the northern Arabian Sea. The total number
of confirmed vessels as of March 31, 2021, is 26,576.
b. Deployment Air Force for Counter Piracy Enforcement
Operates in the high seas of the Gulf of Aden and in the
high seas of the western side of the northern Arabian Sea.
The total number of confirmed vessels as of March 31,
2021, is 17,798.


**(1) Information gathering activities by the SDF**
The SDF’s information gathering activities are part of the
government’s navigation safety measures and are aimed
at collecting information necessary to ensure the safety of
Japan-related vessels.
The activities are to be conducted in accordance with
the provisions of Article 4, paragraph (1), item (xviii) of
the Act for Establishment of the Ministry of Defense,
as they would need smooth decision making and order
issuance in relation to Maritime Security Operations as
measures for unforeseen circumstances or other changes
in the situation, which are provided in Article 82 of the
Self-Defense Forces Law.

**(2) Results of the SDF’s Activities**
In January 2020, two P-3C patrol aircraft left Naha, in
line with the rotation of the counter-piracy unit, and
information gathering activities began in January.
Additionally, the destroyer JS “Takanami” departed
from port in February 2020, and information gathering
activities in the sea area at the site started that same month.
So far, the destroyer JS “Kirisame” as the second unit
and the destroyer JS “Murasame” as the third unit have
been dispatched, and in January 2021, the destroyer JS
“Suzunami” took over mission activities as the fourth unit.
To date, no information has been received that there
were unusual events for Japan-related vessels in the sea
areas where the surface units and aerial units are active.


**(3) Extension of the Activity Period**
In the Middle East, although there is no immediate need to
protect Japan-related vessels, high tensions persist, and,
based on the fact that each country is continuing its own
activities, including the “International Maritime Security
Construct” by the United States and other countries, on
December 11, 2020, the Japanese Government decided to
extend the SDF’s activity period by one year.
In light of the need to ensure the safety of navigation
for Japan-related vessels, if it is deemed before the
expiration of the period that activities by the SDF are
no longer necessary, then, in addition to concluding
activities at that point and without waiting for the end
of the activity period, the National Security Council will
consider how to respond if there is a significant change
in the situation.

**(2) Coastal States in the Middle East**
It is important to gain the understanding of the coastal
states, including Iran, regarding the information gathering
activities that Japan is undertaking as an independent
initiative, and Japan has been explaining these activities
to them with transparency. In addition, the coastal states
play an important role in ensuring safe navigation in the
Middle East. Japan has been reaching out to the coastal
states to gain their understanding of Japan’s efforts.
At the Japan-Iran Defense Ministers’ Video
Teleconference on February 15, 2021, Minister Kishi
explained the extension of information gathering
activities by the SDF for the purpose of ensuring the
safety of navigation of Japan-related vessels in the
Middle East, and requested cooperation towards ensuring
the safe navigation of vessels, including ensuring the
safety of Japan-related vessels and others. Japan intends
to continue to communicate with the coastal states,
including Iran.


**3 Communication and Cooperation with**
**Relevant Countries**

**(1) United States**
As a result of a comprehensive review of what measures
Japan should take to ensure the safe navigation of Japanrelated vessels in the Middle East, Japan has started
to implement efforts as Japan’s independent initiative
without participating in the International Maritime
Security Construct led by the United States, considering
the need for ensuring a stable supply of crude oil, relations
with the United States, and relations with Iran. At the same
time, to ensure safe navigation in the Middle East, the
SDF has been cooperating closely with the United States
in various ways. In the information gathering activities,
the SDF will also appropriately cooperate with the United
States as an ally, while observing the government’s policy
of conducting navigation safety measures independently
from any other country’s initiatives. For this reason, an
MSDF officer has been dispatched to the U.S. Central
Naval Command in Bahrain as a liaison officer to share
information with the U.S. Forces.

new anti-ship missiles and Hyper Velocity Gliding
Projectiles (HVGPs) for the defense of remote islands
to take all initiatives necessary to defend the islands
since 2018, and technologies required for hypersonic
weapons since 2019.
In December 2020, in addition to the aforementioned
research and development, the Cabinet approved
development of improved Type-12 surface-to-ship
guided missile capabilities with the assumption that they
will be operated from a variety of platforms.
Also, in order to secure capabilities for swift and
largescale transportation and deployment of units, initiatives
are underway to enhance rapid deployment capabilities
through: the improvement of Osumi class LST (Landing
Ship, Tank); and the introduction of V-22 Ospreys and C-2
transport aircraft. In particular, for the operation of V-22
Ospreys, the MOD determined that the KYUSHU-SAGA


International AIRPORT was the best airfield to be used as
their deployment site due to positional relationships with
the amphibious deployment brigade and relevant units in
joint operations, the length of the runway, and potential
use as relocation destination of JGSDF Camp Metabaru. In
August 2018, the Governor of Saga Prefecture expressed
their acceptance. The MOD/SDF will continue to work to
gain understanding on deployment at the airport from the
relevant local authorities and others.[3] Meanwhile, in May
2019, the MOD explained their intention to temporarily
deploy V-22 Ospreys at Camp Kisarazu of the GSDF, since
there is the prospect that the deployment at KYUSHUSAGA International AIRPORT will take a certain period
of time. In response to the statement of Kisarazu Mayor
to cooperate with the provisional deployment plan made
in December of the same year, the MOD established a
Tactical Airlift Wing that operates V-22 Osprey in March
2020. Additionally, in July 2020, provisional deployment
began along with the transport of two V-22 Ospreys to
Camp Kisarazu.


At the KYUSHU-SAGA International AIRPORT, the ramp, aircraft hangars, etc., are to be developed on the west side of the airport. Approximately 70 aircraft, consisting of 17 newly acquired V-22

December 2020, the Cabinet approved the replacement of

**Defense Capability**

the land-based Aegis system with two vessels equipped

with the Aegis system.
Today airborne threats to Japan are increasingly
complex and diverse, including ballistic missiles equipped
with multiple/maneuverable warheads, high-speed and
longer-range cruise missiles, and stealth and multi-role
aircraft. In order to effectively and efficiently counter
these airborne threats by optimum means and minimize
damage, it is necessary to establish a structure to conduct
integrated operation of various equipment for missile
defense and air defense equipment that each SDF service
has separately used, thereby providing nation-wide
protection and also enhancing the comprehensive air and
missile defense capability that can simultaneously deal
with multiple, complex airborne threats. In this regard,
the SDF will strive to standardize and streamline the
means for interception that each SDF service possesses,
including their maintenance and supply systems.


**(1) Basic Concept**
Japan began developing the Ballistic Missile Defense
(BMD) system in 2004 to be fully prepared for the
response against ballistic missile attacks. Necessary
amendments were subsequently made to the SDF Law
in July 2005, and in December of the same year, the then
Security Council and Cabinet decided to begin Japan-U.S.
cooperative development of an advanced ballistic missile
interceptor. To date, Japan has steadily built up its own
defense system against ballistic missile attacks, by such
means as installing ballistic missile defense capability to
the Aegis-equipped destroyers and deploying the Patriot
Advanced Capability-3 (PAC-3).[4]

Currently, Japan’s BMD is an effective multi-layered
defense system with the upper tier interception by Aegis
equipped destroyers and the lower tier by Patriot PAC3, both interconnected and coordinated by the Japan


The Patriot PAC-3 system is one of the air defense systems for countering airborne threats. Unlike the conventional type of anti-aircraft PAC-2 missiles, which mainly intercepts aircraft and other
targets, the PAC-3 missiles are designed primarily to intercept ballistic missiles.

JADGE is a core system for the command and control as well as communication functions. It centrally processes the information regarding aircraft captured by radars installed nationwide, and it
provides fighters instructions required for scrambling against aircraft intruding into Japanese territorial airspace and air defense combat operations. In addition, it controls Patriot and radar, etc., in

*JADGE (Japan Aerospace Defense Ground Environment) is a core system for the command and control as well as communication functions. It centrally processes the information regarding
aircraft captured by radars installed nationwide, and it provides fighters with instructions required for scrambling against aircraft intruding into Japanese territorial airspace and air defense
combat operations. In addition, it controls Patriot and radar, etc. in response to ballistic missiles.


In case ballistic missiles or other objects are launched
against Japan as an armed attack, it will be dealt with
by issuing a defense operation order for armed attack
situations. On the other hand, when such a situation is
not yet acknowledged as an armed attack, Japan will take
measures to destroy the ballistic missiles.
As a response against ballistic missiles or other
objects, the Joint Task Force-BMD is formed, with
the Commander of the Air Defense Command serving
as its Commander, and various postures for effective
defense are to be taken under a unified command through
JADGE. Furthermore, the GSDF will play a leading role
in dealing with damage caused by the impact of a fallen
ballistic missile.
From the perspective of deterring ballistic missile
attacks, etc., and preventing damage from those attacks,
the MOD will continue to actively participate in
examinations held by the Cabinet Secretariat in particular
on the development of evacuation facilities equipped with
the necessary functions to protect the lives and bodies
of citizens from armed attacks or disasters from ballistic
missiles, etc.

**(2) Response by the MOD/SDF**
Since 2016, North Korea has conducted three nuclear
tests and launched more than 70 ballistic missiles and
others. These military actions by North Korea pose grave
and imminent threats to Japan’s security. North Korea
expressed its intention to fully denuclearize the Korean
Peninsula at the North Korea-U.S. summit meeting held
in June 2018, and disclosed destruction of its nuclear test
ground. However, the second North Korea-U.S. summit
meeting held in February 2019 ended without any
agreement and North Korea has not so far dismantled all
its weapons of mass destruction or ballistic missiles in a
complete, verifiable and irreversible manner. North Korea
is assessed to have already successfully miniaturized
nuclear weapons to fit ballistic missile warheads through
repeated nuclear tests and ballistic missile launches to
date, and it possesses several hundred ballistic missiles
capable of reaching Japan.
Some of the missiles that were launched in 2019 are
presumed to be new models which can fly at a lower
altitude than conventional ballistic missiles; in addition,
they appear to be able to fly on an irregular trajectory. It
is suggested that the aim is to penetrate missile defense
systems. At the 8th Korean Workers’ Party (KWP)


Congress held in January 2021, the promotion of multiwarhead technology, “hypersonic glide flight warheads,”
nuclear-powered submarines, and solid fuel-propelled
propulsion ICBM development were mentioned.
The MOD/SDF continues to carefully monitor the
concrete actions of North Korea toward the dismantlement
of weapons of mass destruction and missiles, and conducts
the necessary intelligence, monitoring and surveillance
activities, and other necessary activities while closely
cooperating with the United States and other countries.
Further cooperation with the U.S. Government
including the U.S. Forces in Japan is essential for efficient
and effective operation of the BMD system. Thus, related
measures including constant real-time sharing of BMD
operational and relevant information, and the expansion
of BMD cooperation have been agreed upon at the JapanU.S. Security Consultative Committee (2+2 Meeting).
Furthermore, Japan has closely cooperated with the
United States in responding to ballistic missiles, by
means such as receiving Shared Early Warning (SEW)[6]
from the U.S. Forces, and sharing intelligence gathered
by assets including transportable BMD radar (TPY-2
radar) and Aegis-equipped destroyers deployed in Japan
by the U.S. Forces.


Information on the area and time of launch, the projected area and time, where and when objects fall relating to ballistic missiles launched in the direction of Japan, which is analyzed and conveyed


-----

Maintenance, enhancement and validation of JapanU.S. bilateral response capabilities have been actively
conducted through training and other activities. Since
2010, BMD special exercises have been held between
the MSDF and the U.S. Navy, connecting their ships
and other equipment via a network to conduct simulated
ballistic missile response activities. The ASDF
participated in 2018, and the GSDF in 2019 in this
exercise. The exercise is conducted as an integrated air
and missile defense exercise aimed to improve tactical
skills and strengthen cooperation.
In addition to Japan-U.S. cooperation, it is significant to
bolster the cooperation between Japan, the United States
and the Republic of Korea. In January, March, October
and December 2017, trilateral ballistic missile information
sharing exercises were held in sea areas surrounding Japan
with the objective of strengthening coordination.
Sensitive information related to ballistic missiles, etc.,
is adequately shared with relevant countries, including
the United States through a secured infrastructure and
framework[7] to protect secrets.
The SDF conducts various training in peacetime to
improve its capability to counter ballistic missiles. It has
been conducting PAC-3 maneuver deployment training
from June 2017 in an effort to strengthen the SDF’s
capability to counter ballistic missiles and generate
a sense of safety and security among the public. It has
conducted 29 training sessions as of the end of March
2021 including deployments to public facilities.

**(3) Initiatives towards Strengthening of the BMD System**
Currently the SDF maneuvers and deploys, according to
situation, Aegis-equipped destroyers for defense of the
entire territory of Japan and PAC-3, which is deployed


across the country for the defense of stationing locations.
On that premise, the SDF has worked to increase the
number of Aegis BMD destroyers. So far, the MOD
has completed refurbishment of two without BMD
capabilities, “Atago” and “Ashigara,” to give them
BMD capabilities by December 2018. The MOD also
constructed two additional Aegis-equipped destroyers
with BMD capabilities (“Maya” and “Haguro”) using the
FY2015 and FY2016 budgets. These projects increased
the number of Aegis-equipped destroyers with BMD
capabilities from the existing six to eight in FY2020.
Meanwhile, Japan and the United States are jointly
developing advanced interceptor missiles for BMD
(SM-3 Block IIA), which will be the successor to SM-3
Block IA to be mounted on Aegis-equipped destroyers,
and promoting the project to its deployment, in order to
deal with future threats posed by increasingly advanced
and diverse ballistic missile attacks. At the National
Security Council 9-Minister Meeting in December 2016,
a decision was made to transition to joint production and
the deployment phase. Since the FY2017 budget, SM-3
Block IIA acquisitions are ongoing.
Acquisition and deployment of SM-3 Block IIA are
planned to be implemented in FY2021. In comparison
with the previous SM-3 Block IA, SM-3 Block IIA have
not only extended interceptable altitude and coverage of
protection, but also have enhanced defeating capability
and simultaneous engagement capability.
In addition, the interception capabilities of SM-3
Block IIA have been enhanced against ballistic missiles
equipped with interception avoidance measures such as a
decoy and ballistic missiles launched with an intention to
avoid being intercepted by taking a higher than nominal
trajectory (lofted trajectory).[8]

With regard to Patriot PAC-3, the MOD has been
working for procurement of the enhanced capability
type, PAC-3MSE (Missile Segment Enhancement) and

The enforcement of the Act on the Protection of Specially Designated Secrets in December 2014 (Act No. 108 of 2013) has established the basis for protection of highly confidential information related
to national security. In addition, the Agreement between the Government of Japan and the Government of the Republic of Korea on the Protection of Classified Military Information (the Japan-ROK
General Security of Military Information Agreement [GSOMIA]) entered into effect on November 2016. GSOMIA serves as a framework for protecting various classified information, including information
regarding North Korea’s nuclear and missile threat, shared between Japan and the ROK, which is required for practical and effective responses to various situations.

By taking a higher trajectory than minimum energy trajectories (trajectories that enable efficient flying of a missile and maximize its range), it takes a shorter range than the maximum range, but the

In this way Japan is taking measures necessary to
strengthen its protection structure and plans to continue
the efforts.[9]

**(4) Introduction of Aegis Ashore and Suspension of the**
**Deployment Process**

As North Korea’s nuclear weapons and missiles pose grave
and imminent threats to Japan’s security, Japan needs to
work to drastically upgrade its ballistic missile defense
capabilities in order to ensure constant and sustained
protection from peacetime. At meetings of the National
Security Council and Cabinet in December 2017, a decision
was made based on the following ideas to introduce two
Aegis Ashore units, to be retained by the GSDF.



-  The introduction of two units of Aegis Ashore would
enable seamless defense of the entire territory of Japan
24 hours a day and 365 days a year, and the burden on
personnel is anticipated to be lifted significantly.

-  Under the system of eight Aegis-equipped destroyers,
about two of them had to focus on BMD mission only
in the sea in order to protect the entire territory of Japan.
Once two Aegis Ashore units are deployed, however,
Aegis-equipped destroyers can be used for missions
ensuring maritime security, conducting training to
maintain these skills, and ensuring sufficient rotation
of crewmembers, which will be connected to further
strengthen Japan’s deterrence capability as a whole.

-  The radar mounted on Aegis Ashore is highperformance, state-of-the-art SPY-7, and, compared to
the MSDF’s Aegis-equipped destroyers, SPY-7 has the
ability to respond to lofted orbits and the ability to respond
to multiple simultaneous attacks, and dramatically
improves Japan’s ballistic missile defense capability,
such as the ability to respond to lofted orbits and the
ability to respond to multiple simultaneous attacks.


-----

In June 2018, the MOD announced that the GSDF
Araya Maneuver Area in Akita Prefecture and Mutsumi
Maneuver Area in Yamaguchi Prefecture were candidate
sites for the deployment of two unites of Aegis Ashore,
but in June 2020 the MOD decided to suspend the process
related to the deployment of Aegis Ashore.[10]

**(5) Development of a New Missile Defense System**
Regarding alternatives to Aegis Ashore, the U.S. government
and Japanese and U.S. private-sector businesses worked
together from September 2020 to consider the technical
feasibility of mounting Aegis Ashore components on a
mobile offshore platform. They subsequently confirmed that
this was indeed technically possible.
After careful deliberation, the Cabinet approved the
development of two Aegis system-equipped vessels
instead of the land-based Aegis system (Aegis Ashore)
in December 2020, as part of measures to be taken to
respond more flexibly and effectively to the increasingly
severe security environment surrounding Japan.
The ships will be maintained by the MSDF, and their
details, including functions to be added to the ships and
design plans, will continue to be examined and necessary
measures will be taken.
In the Cabinet’s decision, the government is to continue
to consider strengthening deterrence capacity.


**2 Missile Defense of the United States and**
**Japan-U.S. BMD Technical Cooperation**

**(1) Missile Defense of the United States**
The United States is developing a multi-tier missile
defense system that combines defense systems suited for
each of the following phases of the ballistic missile flight
path to provide a mutually complementary response:
(1) the boost phase, (2) the mid-course phase, and
(3) the terminal phase. Japan and the United States have
developed close coordination concerning ballistic missile
defense, and a part of the missile defense system of the
United States has been deployed in our country in a stepby-step manner.[11]


**Chapter**


**(2) Japan-U.S. BMD Technology Cooperation, etc.**
The government commenced a Japan-U.S. cooperative
research project on a sea-based upper-tier system in
FY1999. As the result showed good prospects for resolving
initial technical challenges, in December 2005, the then
Security Council and the Cabinet decided to start JapanU.S. cooperative development of an advanced ballistic
missile interceptor by using the results of the project as
a technical basis.[12] The joint development started in June
2006 with a view to expanding the coverage of protection
and dealing with future threats posed by increasingly
advanced and diverse ballistic missiles attacks.
In February and June 2017, Japan and the United
States conducted tests of the SM-3 Block IIA interceptor
in waters off Hawaii. Analysis of the test data confirmed
that it meets all performance requirements.
In November 2020, the U.S. conducted a sea launch
test of SM-3 Block IIA off the coast of Hawaii and,
based on information from a satellite system, succeeded
in intercepting an ICBM-like missile launched from an
experiment facility in the Marshall Islands.


10 With regards to the effect caused by the booster dropping, since August 2018, the MOD explained to the local communities based on the discussion with the U.S. side up to that time that it would
take firm steps to implement measures to control fly-out trajectories of the interceptor (SM-3), to make sure its booster would fall within the Mutsumi Maneuver Area. Meanwhile for Akita Prefecture,
since August of the same year, the MOD explained to the local communities that the booster would fall into the sea in the case of the Araya Maneuver Area.

However, it was found out in late May 2020 that not only the software but also the entire system including hardware needed to be refurbished in order to control fly-out trajectories of SM-3 to safely
drop its booster within the Mutsumi maneuver area or into the sea in the case of coastal area such as Araya Maneuver Area, which would require a considerable amount of cost and time.

The MOD concluded that it was not reasonable to invest additional cost and time, and that it became unable to deliver on commitments to the local people. For that reason, the MOD announced the
decision to suspend the process of the deployment of Aegis Ashore.

11 Specifically, a TPY-2 radar (so-called X-band radar) for BMD has been deployed at the U.S. Shariki Communication Site in 2006. In October 2006, Patriot PAC-3 units were deployed in Okinawa
Prefecture, and in October 2007, a Joint Tactical Ground Station (JTAGS) was deployed in Aomori Prefecture. Furthermore, the 2nd TPY-2 radar was deployed at the U.S. Kyogamisaki Communication
Site in December 2014. In October 2018, the 38th Air Defense Artillery Brigade Headquarters was deployed in Sagamihara. In addition, BMD-capable Aegis ships of the U.S. Forces were deployed
at Commander Fleet Activities, Yokosuka (Yokosuka City, Kanagawa Prefecture) in October 2015, March 2016 and May 2018.

12 With regard to the Japan-U.S. cooperative development, it is necessary to export BMD related arms from Japan to the United States. In accordance with the Chief Cabinet Secretary’s statement issued
in December 2004, it was determined that the Three Principles on Arms Exports would not apply to the BMD system and related matters under the condition that strict controls are maintained. Based
on these circumstances, it was decided that the prior consent of Japan could be given to the third party transfer of the SM-3 Block IIA under certain conditions. This decision was formally announced
in the Joint Statement of the Japan-U.S. Security Consultative Committee (2+2 Meeting) in June 2011. The Three Principles on Transfer of Defense Equipment and Technology (Three Principles)
received Cabinet approval in April 2014. However, with regard to exceptional measures instigated before the Three Principles were decided, overseas transfers will continue to be organized in the

**3** **Response to Attacks by Guerillas, Special Operations Forces and Others**


In Japan, where most of the towns and cities are highly
urbanized, even small-scale infiltrations and attacks
can pose a serious threat against the country’s peace
and security. These cases refer to various mode and
forms including illegal activities by infiltrated foreign
armed agents,[13] etc., and sabotage carried out by foreign
guerillas or special forces, which can be deemed as an
armed attack against Japan.

**1 Basic Concept**


on this, in the event of an infiltration of our territory by
guerrillas or special operations forces, they will be searched
for and detected by reconnaissance units, aviation units
and others, and combat units will be promptly deployed to
besiege and capture or to destroy them.

See Fig. III-1-2-6 (Example of Operations against the Attacks by

Guerillas and Special Forces)

**3 Response to Armed Agents**


**Chapter**


**(1) Basic Concept**
While the police assume primary responsibility for
responding to illegal activities of armed agents, the
SDF will respond in accordance with situational
developments. When this happens, the SDF cooperates
with the police force. Accordingly, with regard to public
security operations of the SDF, the Basic Agreement[14]
concerning cooperation procedures between the SDF and
the police, as well as local agreements between GSDF
divisions/brigades and prefectural police forces, have
been concluded.[15]

See Part II, Chapter 5, 3-1 (Public Security Operations), p. 238

**(2) Initiatives of the MOD/SDF**
The GSDF has been conducting field training exercises
nationwide with the police of each prefecture, in an effort
to strengthen such collaboration by conducting field
exercises at nuclear power plants throughout the country
since 2012.[16] Furthermore, joint exercises in dealing with


In the stage where the actual situation of intruders and
the details of the ongoing case are not clear, the police
primarily respond to the situation, while the MOD/SDF
will collect relevant information and reinforce the security
of the SDF facilities. When the situation is clearer and can
be dealt with by the general police force, various forms
of assistance such as transportation of police officers and
provision of equipment to the police force will be carried
out. If the case cannot be dealt with by the general police
force, then public security operations by the SDF will be
implemented. Furthermore, if it has been confirmed that
an armed attack is being carried out against Japan, the
SDF will respond under a defense operation order.

**2 Responses to Attacks by Guerillas and**
**Special Operations Forces**


Typical forms of attacks by guerrillas or special forces
include the destruction of critical private infrastructure
and other facilities, attacks against people, and
assassinations of dignitaries.
In dealing with attacks by guerrillas or special forces,
the MOD/SDF will respond with a particular emphasis
on the establishment of a relevant information gathering
posture, monitoring and surveillance to prevent invasions
in coastal areas, protection of key facilities, and search and
destruction of invading guerrillas or special forces. Efforts
will be made for early detection of attacks and indications
through monitoring and surveillance, and, as required,
the SDF units will be deployed to protect key facilities,
such as nuclear power plants, and the necessary posture
for protection will be established at an early stage. Based

1995 is one of the examples of an incident in which these
weapons were used.

**(1) Basic Concept**
In the event of the use of NBC weapons in Japan in a
way that corresponds to an armed attack, the SDF will
conduct defense operations to repel the armed attack and
rescue victims. Furthermore, in the event of the use of
NBC weapons in a way that does not correspond to an
armed attack but against which the general police alone
cannot maintain public security, the SDF will conduct
public security operations to suppress the armed group
and rescue victims in cooperation with related agencies.
Furthermore, when the incident does not fall under


In recent years, there has been strong recognition of the
danger of NBC (Nuclear, Biological, and Chemical)
weapon proliferation, which can cause indiscriminate
mass casualties and contamination of an extensive area,
and the means for transporting such weapons, as well
as related equipment and materials, to terrorists and
countries under suspicion of proliferating such weapons.

**4** **Readiness against Invasion**


The NDPG states that only the necessary level of readiness
against land invasions involving the mobilization of large
ground forces, which was expected primarily during the
Cold War, will be retained.
In the event of a military attack on Japan, the
SDF will respond with defensive mobilization. Their
operations are categorized into (1) operations for aerial
air defense operations, (2) defense operations protecting
waters around Japan, (3) operations protecting the
land, and (4) operations ensuring security in maritime
communication, based on the characteristic of their
purposes. In executing these operations, the U.S. Forces
will assist the operations implemented by the SDF and
deploy operations to complement the capabilities of the
SDF, including the use of striking power, in line with the
Guidelines for Japan-U.S. Defense Cooperation.

Fig. III-1-2-7 Example of Air Defense Operations


**1 Air Defense Operations**

Based on the geographic features of Japan, in that it is
surrounded by the sea, and the features of modern wars,[18]
it is expected that at first, a sudden attack against Japan
will be exercised by aircraft and missiles, and such aerial
attacks are assumed to be conducted repeatedly, in the
case where a full-scale invasion against Japan occurs.
Operations for aerial defense[19] aim to deal with enemy
aerial attacks at the farthest point from our territory,
prohibiting enemies from gaining air superiority and
preventing harm to the people and the sovereign territory
of Japan. At the same time, efforts will be made to
inflict significant damage on the enemy thus making the
continuation of their aerial attack difficult.

For invading ground and airborne troops, it tends to
be difficult to exert systematic combat capabilities while

If an armed attack is carried out against Japan, which
is an island country, aerial attacks are expected to be
combined with attacks against our ships and territory by
enemy destroyers. In addition, transport vessels could
be deployed to enable massive enemy ground forces to
invade our territory. Our defense operations protecting
the waters surrounding Japan are composed of measures
at sea, measures in waters around our coasts, measures
in major straits, and aerial defense above waters around
Japan. We will protect the waters around our country
by combining these multiple operations, blocking the
invasion of our enemies, and attacking and depleting
their combat capabilities.

Japan depends upon other countries for the supply of much
of its resources and food, making maritime transportation
routes the lifeblood for securing the foundation of our
existence and prosperity. Furthermore, if our country
comes under armed attack, etc., maritime transportation
routes will be the foundation to maintain continuous
warfare capabilities and enable the U.S. Forces to come
and assist in the defense of Japan.
In operations to ensure the safety of our maritime
transportation, the SDF will combine various operations
such as anti-sea anti-submarine anti-air and anti-mine


In order to invade the islands of Japan, invading countries
are expected to gain sea and air superiority, followed by

**2 Initiatives of the MOD/SDF**


**1 The Whole-of-Government Approach**


The National Space Policy Secretariat[1] established in the
Cabinet Office in April 2016 engages in the planning,
drafting, coordinating, and other policy matters relating
to the Government’s development and use of space. In
light of the environmental changes surrounding space
policy and the new security policies stated in the National
Security Strategy (NSS) that was approved by the Cabinet
in 2013, the new Basic Plan on Space Policy was decided
upon in June 2020. This Plan, which aims to make Japan
become a self-sustained space-faring nation, set goals
of (1) contributing to a wide range of national interests;
and (2) strengthening the comprehensive foundations of
Japan’s space activities including industrial, scientific
and technological bases. In particular, concerning the
contributions to a variety of national interests, the plan
states that Japan should advance: (1) ensuring space
security; (2) contributing to disaster management,
national resilience, and solving global issues; (3) creating
new knowledge through space science and exploration;

in security, the growing dependence of the economy
and society on space systems, the increasing risks, the
more active space activities from other countries and the
private sector, the expansion of space activities, and the
rapid evolution of science and technology.
Based on the Mid-Term Defense Program (MTDP),
the MOD/SDF will work to enhance capabilities to
ensure superiority in the use of space at all stages from
peacetime to armed contingencies. The efforts include
(1) establishing a Space Situational Awareness (SSA)
system in order to secure the stable use of space;
(2) improving various capabilities to leverage space
domain including information-gathering, communication
and positioning capabilities; (3) developing the capability
to disrupt C4I (command, control, communication,
computer, and intelligence) of opponents in collaboration
with the electromagnetic domain; and (4) working to
enhance cooperation with relevant agencies, including
the Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency (JAXA), and
with the United States and other relevant countries. The
SDF will also engage in such organization building as the
creation of units and a career field specializing in space,
and is developing human resources and accumulating
knowledge and expertise in the space domain.

See Fig. III-1-3-1 (Conceptual Image of Utilization of Space in the

See

Security Field)

**(1) Strengthening SSA**
When using outer space, it is necessary to ensure its
stable use. However, there has been a rapid increase in
the volume of space debris in outer space, raising the
risk of significant damage to satellite functions caused by
collision between debris and satellite.
In addition, it is pointed out that the development and
verification test of killer satellites to approach a target
satellite to disrupt, attack, and capture it is underway,
increasing the threat to the space system on which Japan’s
security, economy, and society depend.
That is why the MOD, based on the Basic Plan on
Space Policy and through cooperation with relevant
government agencies and ministries, such as the JAXA,
and the United States, etc., is aiming to strengthen SSA in
order for the governments to work as a whole to monitor
outer space and to accurately identify situations.
Following the establishment of the Space Operations
Squadron in May 2020, a new unit responsible for the
command and control of planning and carrying out a
variety of activities in the space domain will be founded
in FY2021. Additionally, the Space Operations Group
(tentative name) is to be established as the senior unit
of the two squadrons. These moves aim to strengthen
the units specializing in the space domain. Furthermore,
in addition to promoting a variety of initiatives for the


actual operation of the SSA system, which is scheduled
for FY2023, initiatives to introduce SSA satellites (spacebased optical telescopes), etc., are underway with the
goal of launching them in FY2026.
In doing so, along with continuously participating
in multilateral space situational awareness tabletop
exercises (Global Sentinel), the development of the SSA
system will be effectively promoted via the dispatch of
SDF personnel to the U.S. Space Command. In addition,
the Space Operations Squadron conducted the SSA
training in the Japan-U.S. Bilateral Joint Field Training
Exercise (FTX) “Keen Sword 21” that was conducted
from October to November 2020.
Through personnel exchanges across both the public
and private sectors, the MOD is working to develop and
utilize core human resources in the SSA field.
Furthermore, in order to build SSA-related capacity
and to strengthen that capacity in the future, the MOD
is promoting specific efforts for the specification of the
necessary operational procedures for SSA in collaboration
with the United States, cooperation with relevant
government agencies and ministries such as JAXA,
bilateral and multilateral cooperation with the United
States and France, etc., and an examination of systems
to share SSA-related information with private-sector
businesses, etc. Plus, with regards to electromagnetic
environmental information in outer space, the MOD is
promoting collaboration with the National Institute of
Information and Communications Technology (NICT)
on the utilization of space weather information.

See Fig. III-1-3-2 (Initiatives for Developing the SSA System)

**(2) Improving Various Capabilities to Leverage**
**Space Domain Including Information-Gathering,**
**Communication and Positioning Capabilities**

While the MOD/SDF has conducted informationgathering, communication and positioning using
satellites, from the perspective of strengthening
Command, Control, Communication, Computer,
Intelligence, Surveillance, Reconnaissance (C4ISR)
functions, the MOD/SDF will ensure redundancy by
receiving signals from multiple positioning satellites,
including from the Quasi Zenith Satellite System
(QZSS), and by using commercial satellites, etc.
The MOD/SDF will strengthen its intelligence
and surveillance capabilities through acquisition of
multilayered satellite images such as by using Information
Gathering Satellites (IGS) with the aim of a 10 satellite
system, and by using commercial satellites such as small
satellite constellations that enable frequent imaging.
It will also continue to use images from the satellite
operated by JAXA (ALOS-2) and information from
Automatic Identification System (AIS) etc and will

Regarding communications, the MOD/SDF launched
X-band defense communications satellites called
Kirameki-2 in January 2017 and Kirameki-1 in April
2018, owned and operated by the MOD for the first time,
to be used for the communications, which is essential for
command and control in unit operations. Going forward,
in order to respond to the increase in communication
requirements and to further strengthen resiliency, the
MOD will aim for a system of three X-band defense
communications satellites by launching Kirameki-3 in
FY2022. The ministry will also conduct research and
surveys on the next defense communication satellites.
With regard to positioning, the MOD/SDF mounts
GPS receiving terminals on a large number of equipment
and uses them as important means to support troop
movement, including highly accurate self-positioning
and improvement of missile guidance. In addition to these
efforts, the QZSS[3] of the Cabinet Office started service in
November 2018. With this in mind, the MOD/SDF will
secure redundancy by using multiple positioning satellite
signals, including QZSS. In addition, in order to strengthen
the resiliency of satellite positioning capabilities, the
budget for FY2021 included the necessary expenditures
required for research on multi-GNSS receivers, including
the public signals from QZSS.

**(3) Enhancing Capabilities to Ensure Superiority in Use**
**of Space**

While utilization of satellites plays a vital role as the
basic infrastructure for security, some countries appear
to be developing anti-satellite weapons, including killer
satellites, anti-satellite missiles, and jamming weapons
that interfere with electromagnetic waves. In this context,
it is also important for the MOD/SDF to strengthen
satellite resilience.
For this purpose, the SDF, as part of strengthening
the resiliency of space utilization, is proceeding
with the introduction of devices to grasp the state of
electromagnetic interference against Japanese satellites.
The SDF will build the capability to disrupt C4I of
opponents in coordination with the electromagnetic
domain capabilities.
Furthermore, in the way of situations around
technologies related to functions such as early warnings,
missile detection, and tracking, the SDF will study

small satellite constellations while also bearing in mind
cooperation with the United States, and will promote the
accumulation of technical knowledge through research
on dual wavelength infrared sensors and the research of
future sensors such as high-sensitivity wideband infrared
detection elements.


**(4) Enhancing Cooperation with Relevant Agencies**
**and with the United States and Other Relevant**
**Countries**

In order to ensure Japan’s space security and the sustainable
and stable use of outer space, while strategically
cooperating with allies and friendly countries and from
a comprehensive perspective that includes measures
against space debris, etc., it is necessary to play an even
greater role in creating effective rules and to request each
country’s responsible behavior in outer space.
At the same time, in order to avoid the risks from
misunderstanding and miscalculation, it is necessary
to communicate the importance of strengthening
communication among relevant countries and of
implementing Transparency and Confidence Building
Measures (TCBM) in outer space.
Also, for the MOD to promote space development
and use effectively, it is essential to enhance cooperation
with relevant agencies with advanced knowledge,
including JAXA, and with the United States and other
relevant countries.
From the perspective of further promoting cooperation
in the space field between the defense authorities of
Japan and the United States, the two countries established
the “Japan-U.S. Space Cooperation Working Group
(SCWG)” in April 2015 and so far held seven meetings.


Research is underway to mount dual wavelength infrared sensors with excellent detection and identification performance on the Advanced Optical Satellite planned at JAXA and activate them in the
space environment.

This refers to satellites set into orbit so that the satellites are capable of staying nearly right above one specific area by tilting the orbit, while ordinary stationary satellites stay on the equator. Multiple
satellites are usually launched since a single satellite cannot stay online for 24 hours by itself. Users are able to receive signals from such satellites without being affected by obstacles, such as

**Column** **Study on Utilization of Satellite Constellations for Missile Defense**

In recent years, the United States and other countries have been
promoting the so-called satellite constellation project, which
sees a number of small artificial satellites perform various
functions in unison. The project is expected to contribute to
enhanced abilities of information collection to perform in
space and to maintain satellite functionality in the event of
damage. It is pointed out that, there have been developments
of hypersonic glide weapons (HGVs) in some countries, which
fly at low altitudes at high speeds and in irregular orbits. In
FY2021, MOD will conduct studies of the concept of HGV
detection and tracking systems using satellite constellations HGV detection and tracking system using satellite constellations (image)
and research on advanced infrared sensors, with collaboration
with the United States in mind.


The SCWG continues to further promote consideration
in broader fields such as: (1) promotion of space policyrelated consultation, (2) closer information sharing,
(3) cooperation for training and securing space experts,
and (4) implementation of tabletop exercises.
As part of these efforts, the MOD has continuously
participated in the U.S. Space Force-sponsored multilateral

With regard to cybersecurity, the number of cases that
were detected as suspicious communication to Japanese
governmental organizations include 55 suspected malware
infections and 30 targeted attacks in FY2019. The actual
threat level continues to be high, with the attack methods
being increasingly sophisticated and ingenious.[4]

As for organizations other than governmental
organizations, multiple suspicious communications to
private companies, including defense-related companies,
have been confirmed. In addition, there were cases in
which investigations by police authorities concluded that
it was likely that the People’s Liberation Army units were
involved in cyber attacks against multiple companies.
In order to deal with the increasing threat to
cybersecurity, in November 2014, the Basic Act on
Cybersecurity was enacted. The Act aims to contribute to

the security of Japan by comprehensively and effectively
promoting the measures regarding cybersecurity.
In response to this, in January 2015, the Cybersecurity
Strategic Headquarters was established in the Cabinet,
and the National center of Incident readiness and Strategy
for Cybersecurity (NISC)[5] was established in the Cabinet
Secretariat. The Cybersecurity Strategic Headquarters
and NISC are responsible for planning and promotion
of cybersecurity-related policies and serve as the control
tower in taking measures and responding to significant
cybersecurity incidents in government organizations and

live safely and with peace of mind, and to contribute to
the peace and stability of the international community as
well as the security of Japan.
Furthermore, in July 2018 the strategy was reviewed
to promote cybersecurity for sustainable development
and initiatives from three perspectives ((1) mission
assurance by service providers, (2) risk management, and
(3) participation, cooperation and collaboration), while
adhering to the basic position of the strategy.

**2 Initiatives of the MOD/SDF**


(3) maintenance and development of a response posture
to cyber attacks, (4) research of cutting edge technologies,
(5) development of human resources, and (6) coordination
with other organizations and agencies, etc.
In this context based on the NDPG, the SDF will
fundamentally strengthen its cyber defense capability,
including the capability to disrupt the opponent’s use
of cyberspace for the attack against Japan in time
of emergency. Specifically, the MTDP stipulates
(1) establishment of the necessary environment for
ensuring cybersecurity, (2) keeping abreast of the latest
information including cyber-related risks, counter
measures and technological trends, (3) development and
securing of human resources, and (4) contribution to the
whole-of-government initiatives.

See Fig. III-1-3-3 (MOD/SDF Comprehensive Measures to Deal with

Cyber Attacks)
Reference 13 (Efforts in Recent Years by the MOD on
Cybersecurity)


Information and communications networks that leverage
cyberspace form a foundation for the SDF’s activities
in various domains, and any attack against them would
seriously disrupt the organized activities of the SDF.
The MOD/SDF are taking comprehensive measures
such as (1) ensuring safety of information systems,
(2) dealing with cyber attacks[6] via specialized units,


Illegal intrusion, information theft, alteration or destruction, operation stop/malfunction of information system, execution of unauthorized program, DDoS (distributed denial of service) attacks, etc.,


-----

**(1) Establishing an Environment for Ensuring**
**Cybersecurity**

a. New Establishment of the SDF Cyber Defense Force
(tentative name)
The NDP and MTDP states the new establishment of a
“Cyber Defense Force” as a joint unit so as to drastically
strengthen cyber defense capabilities. Based on these
documents, in FY2021, in addition to the expansion of
the system of the Cyber Defense Unit, etc., integration
of cyber protection functions of the Ground, Maritime,
and Air SDFs into one joint unit of JSDF Cyber Defense
Command (tentative name) will be initiated, thereby
enhancing the organization by approximately 160
personnel. The newly formed JSDF Cyber Defense
Command (tentative name) will primarily deal with
cyber attacks, as well as conduct capacity building for
the SDF’s cyber-related units, and maintain and operate
the Defense Information Infrastructure (DII),[7] a common
network for the MOD/SDF.
b. Strengthening Capabilities of Information Gathering,
Research and Analysis
In order to secure functions of the system and network of
the MOD/SDF under any circumstance, it is necessary to
strengthen the capabilities of information gathering, research
and analysis, and develop a practical training environment.
To this end, the MOD/SDF will continue initiatives
such as (1) upgrading of information gathering devices
for indications and techniques of cyber attacks,
(2) enhancement of response capabilities against cyber
attacks utilizing AI and other advanced technologies, and
(3) development of an environment for cyber exercises
carried out as competition between an attacking team and
a defending team.
In addition, the Defense Intelligence Headquarters
also collects and analyzes necessary information on
trends in cyberspace threats, such as by collecting open
source information and exchanging information with
other countries.

**(2) Keeping Abreast of the Latest Information Including**
**Risks, Counter Measures and Technological Trends**

In order to respond to cyber attacks in a swift and
appropriate manner, it is necessary to keep abreast of the
latest information, including cyber-related risks, counter
measures and technological trends, through cooperation
with the private sector, and strategic talks, joint exercises
and other opportunities with allies and other parties. For
this purpose, the MOD/SDF will effectively cooperate
with private companies and foreign countries, including
the United States, which is Japan’s ally.


a. Cooperation with Private Companies and Others
In Japan, in July 2013, the Cyber Defense Council
(CDC) was set up with its member consisting of around
ten companies in the defense industry with a strong
interest in cybersecurity. With the MOD serving as the
hub for information sharing among companies in the
defense industry, the information will be aggregated, and
efforts will be made to grasp the overall picture of cyber
attacks. In addition, a joint training takes place annually,
simulating a situation where the MOD/SDF, and defense
industry are under cyber attacks as part of efforts to
improve both of their cyber response capabilities.
b. Cooperation with the United States
Since it is vital to have comprehensive defense cooperation,
including joint response, between Japan and its ally the
United States, the Japanese and U.S. governments, as
their main framework for cyber cooperation, first set up
the Cyber Defense Policy Working Group (CDPWG) as a
framework between the defense authorities of Japan and
the United States. Under this framework, meetings have
been held seven times to discuss the following topics:
(1) promotion of policy discussions regarding cyber
issues, (2) closer sharing of information, (3) promotion
of joint exercises incorporating response to cyber attacks,
and (4) matters such as cooperation for training and
retaining experts.
In addition, Japan’s cooperation with the United
States is to be further strengthened by such means as
participation in “the Japan-U.S. Cyber Dialogue,” a
whole-of-government framework by both nations, and
holding “the Japan-U.S. IT Forum.”

See Chapter 2, Section 2-1-2 (Cooperation on Cyberspace), p. 314

c. Cooperation with Other Countries etc.
Japan has organized the “Japan-NATO Expert Staff Talks
on Cyber Defense,” etc., with the respective defense
authorities of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization
(NATO) and others to exchange opinions on various issues
related to cyberspace, and has continued to participate
in cyber defense exercises organized by NATO and the
NATO Cooperative Cyber Defence Centre of Excellence
(CCDCOE) to enhance cooperation and collaboration
with NATO.
In addition, Japan has held cyber dialogues with
Australia, the United Kingdom, Germany, and Estonia.
Furthermore, the IT Forum has been held with
the defense authorities of Singapore, Vietnam, and
other countries to exchange views on initiatives in the
information communications area including cybersecurity
and current trends in technology.

**(3) Development and Securing of Human Resources**
In order to strengthen the cyber defense capability of
the SDF, it is necessary to secure human resources with
advanced and broad-ranging knowledge on cybersecurity.
In this context, personnel are continuously and by stages
assigned to cyber-related departments, and provided with
both internal and external education in order to acquire and
maintain advanced knowledge and skills.
To this end, a common cyber course[8] to learn common
and sophisticated knowledge on cybersecurity has been
provided since FY2019 as a common educational course
for all SDF services, and the scale of which is planned to
be expanded.
In addition, the SDF has continued to dispatch
personnel to courses for cyber warfare commanders at
the National War College in order to make them learn
about commanders’ decision-making processes in cyber
warfare in the United States.
Furthermore, in addition to providing education
utilizing external educational institutions, as well as
to acquire human resources with broader background
from outside, the SDF has implemented initiatives for
recruiting the chief cybersecurity advisors with advanced
and up-to-date knowledge about cyber technologies and
cyber attack trends, and has held a MOD cyber contest
for civilians.
The MOD/SDF also work to ensure appropriate
treatment for security and IT human resources who
work as a bridge between highly professional human
resources and general administration departments
in the MOD[9] and consider the utilization of external
human resources through a public-private personnel

In order to gain an advantage in electromagnetic warfare,
it is important to gather and analyze information on
electromagnetic spectrum at all phases from peacetime
to armed contingencies and appropriately share the
information among SDF units.
To this end, the MOD/SDF plans to enhance
information gathering and analysis capabilities through:
establishment of electromagnetic operation units to gather
information regarding electromagnetic spectrum as
subordinate units of the Ground Component Command;
under the FY2021 budget, acquire equipment (that will
be) installed in ASDF RC-2 aircraft with equipment
for electromagnetic spectrum information gathering
to expand frequency reception bands and to improve
long-distance target collection capabilities, and, prior to
the development of the successor to the MSDF’s multipurpose EP-3 aircraft, conduct research on information


In order to gain an advantage in warfare by using
electromagnetic spectrum proactively and effectively, it is
necessary to build capabilities to manage electromagnetic
spectrum by centrally grasping and coordinating
wave frequencies and status of use, and appropriately
allocating frequency resources to units, etc. in addition
to electronic warfare capabilities to ensure the use and
effect of electromagnetic spectrum while interfering with

Neutralizing use of electromagnetic spectrum, including
radar and communications of an opponent who intends to
invade Japan based on information gathering and analysis
in peacetime is effective as a means for the defense of
Japan so that even when inferiority exists in individual
domains such inferiority will be overcome and national
defense accomplished.
To this end, under the FY2021 budget, the MOD/SDF
will: acquire the GSDF’s Network Electronic Warfare
System (NEWS) that disables an opponent’s use of the
electromagnetic spectrum to provide advantages in a
variety of battles, such as in the deployment of firepower
or in land battles; develop ASDF standoff electronic
warfare aircraft that implement effective electromagnetic


To strengthen the SDF’s capabilities in the electromagnetic
domain and to develop personnel with specialized
knowledge, along with their regular education and
training from peacetime, it is also important to participate
in training, exercises, and education in the United States
and other countries, which have advanced know-how
backed by practical experience.
For this reason, in addition to conducting integrated
electronic warfare training and strengthening operational
capabilities in the electromagnetic domain, the MOD/

c. Disaster Relief to Prevent the Spread of CommunityAcquired Infections of COVID-19
COVID-19 has become a global pandemic and is regarded
as a serious security threat to the international community,
including Japan. The MOD/SDF have made a variety of
all-out efforts to prevent the spread of COVID-19.
From April 2020 to the end of March 2021, the SDF,
in response to requests from prefectural governors,
conducted disaster relief operations in 35 prefectures
to prevent the spread of community-acquired infections
of COVID-19. During these disaster relief operations,
the SDF conducted capacity building to approximately
2,400 local government employees in 33 prefectures
on preventing infection[2] emergency accommodation
support to approximately 760 recovering patients in eight
prefectures, transport support moving approximately
90 patients in six prefectures from hospitals to
accommodation facilities, medical support in four
prefectures, deployment/maintenance/management of
tents necessary for outdoor PCR testing in one prefecture,
transport in five prefectures of approximately 80 patients
from outbreaks on remote islands, and dispatched the CT
diagnostic vehicle owned by the SDF in one prefecture.

Prefectures. As prompt epidemic prevention measures,
including slaughter of pigs, were required, the SDF assisted
with the slaughter and other measures in response to disaster
relief requests from the governors of the prefectures.[3] These
missions engaged around 2,000 personnel.
f. Disaster Relief in Response to Forest Fire
From April 2020 to the end of March 2021, local
authorities conducted firefighting operations against
forest fires that broke out in Yamaguchi Prefecture, Tokyo,
Gunma Prefecture, and Tochigi Prefecture, but they were
unable to extinguish the fires despite their efforts. Based
on requests issued by the governors of the prefectures, the
SDF conducted aerial firefighting and other operations.
The SDF dispatched about 3,100 personnel, about 280
vehicles, about 140 aircraft. Approximately 3,250 tons of
water was used on 715 occasions.

Fig. III-1-4-4 Summary of Five-year Acceleration Measures for Disaster Prevention/Mitigation and National Resilience (MOD)


**Chapter**

|Name of measure|Details|
|---|---|
|Measures on materials and equipment for SDF air station facilities, etc.|To ensure enhanced infrastructure soundness, including air station facilities, etc. used by the SDF in various situations, including disasters, secure the stable operations of the SDF through medium- to long-term and continuous establishment of procurement of necessary materials and equipment needed in the refurbishment and utilization of air station facilities.|
|Measures to strengthen SDF infrastructure|In order to enhance the strength of infrastructure used by the SFD, including air station facilities and port facilities, in various situations including disasters, after conducting inspections, the SDF air stations and port facilities will be consistently enhanced with further facility functions on a medium- to long-term and continuous basis to ensure stable operations of the SDF.|
|Measures to strengthen SDF facility buildings, etc.|In order to maintain stability of SDF facilities that form the basis of unit operations, inspections will be implemented based on the three-year emergency measure, with projects that lead to enhanced disaster response performance, including earthquake- resistant measures and aging measures for buildings of SDF facilities.|


**(4) Formulating Plans for Responding to Various**
**Disasters**

In the event of the occurrence of various disasters, the
MOD/SDF will take all possible measures such as swift
transportation and deployment of sufficiently sized units
in their initial response. By establishing a rotating staffing
posture, the MOD/SDF is able to respond over the longterm. In doing so, the MOD/SDF will fully take into
account the lessons learned from the Great East Japan
Earthquake and other disasters.
The MOD/SDF formulates various contingency plans
for responses to large-scale earthquakes, which are
under consideration at the Central Disaster Management
Council, based on the Ministry of Defense Disaster
Prevention Plan to respond to such earthquakes.

**(5) Exercises Involving the SDF**
In order to respond to large-scale and various other
disasters in a speedy and appropriate manner, the SDF
carries out various disaster prevention drills, and also
actively participates in disaster prevention drills organized
by the Japanese Government or local governments and is
seeking to ensure cooperation with various ministries and
agencies, and local governments.
a. Joint Exercise for Rescue (JXR)
The SDF conducts disaster drills concerning its command
and staff activities, and coordination between its major
units and with organizations related to disaster prevention
in the event of a large-scale earthquake to maintain and
enhance the SDF’s earthquake response capability. In 2019,
the SDF carried out training assuming the occurrence of
an earthquake directly hitting the Tokyo area during the
Tokyo 2020 Olympic and Paralympic Games.[4]

In March 2021, after discussing the issues and
problems, etc., associated with the response to an
earthquake directly hitting the Tokyo area during the
Tokyo 2020 Olympic and Paralympic Games, the
SDF held a training session in May to improve the
effectiveness of its disaster response during the events.


patients, with dispatches to remote islands such as
the Southwestern Islands (Okinawa and Kagoshima
Prefectures), the Ogasawara Islands (Tokyo), and remote
islands of Nagasaki Prefecture representing the majority
of such cases.
In addition, the SDF carries out sea rescues upon
requests by the Japan Coast Guard on such occasions as
transport of emergency patients from vessels navigating
areas of ocean far from the mainland where the aircraft of
other organizations are unable to respond, due to reasons
including a short flight range and emergencies of vessels
due to incidents such as capsizing. Furthermore, the SDF
conducts long-distance transportation for serious-case
patients, by the ASDF transport aircraft C-130H utilizing
its mobile medical units in certain occasions.
Furthermore, in FY2020, the SDF carried out
33 dispatches of firefighting support, with 25 cases
responding to fire in the areas near SDF facilities.

**(3) The MOD/SDF Response to Nuclear Disasters**
In order to respond to nuclear disasters, the MOD/SDF has
formulated “The SDF Nuclear Disaster Response Plan.”
The SDF also participates in general nuclear disaster
prevention drills jointly implemented by the government,
local governments, and nuclear operators, to confirm the
effectiveness of municipal governments’ evacuation plan
and to strengthen cooperation with relevant agencies in
a nuclear disaster emergency. Moreover, since October
2014, SDF personnel (three personnel of the GSDF, one
personnel from the MSDF, and one personnel from the
ASDF, for a total of five personnel as of March 31, 2021)
were transferred (on temporary assignment) to a section in
charge of nuclear disaster prevention within the Cabinet
Office as part of an effort to enhance the effectiveness of
nuclear disaster response capabilities.


On March 30, 2020, it was decided that the Tokyo 2020 Olympic and Paralympic Games will take place between July 23 and August 8, 2021, and between August 24 and September 5, 2021,

b. Tomodachi Rescue Exercise (TREX) Joint Disaster
Response Exercise with U.S. Forces
In February 2021, joint exercises were held with U.S.
Forces stationed in Japan in the scenario of the Nankai
Trench earthquake. The purpose of the exercise was to
maintain and enhance earthquake disaster relief capabilities
in collaboration between the SDF and U.S. forces.
c. Remote Island Disaster Relief Exercise (RIDEX)
In September 2019, the SDF participated in general
disaster prevention training planned and organized
by Okinawa Prefecture and a disaster drill of Ishigaki
citizens and conducted a field training exercise to deal
with sudden largescale disasters in a remote island to
maintain as well as enhance the SDF’s ability to respond
to disasters in remote islands and strengthen collaboration
with relevant local authorities.
d. Drill for medical treatment activities following a largescale earthquake
In September 2019, the SDF participated in a drill
organized by the Cabinet Office for medical treatment
activities following a large-scale earthquake. In this drill,
the SDF practiced various activities for disaster relief
and coordination with organizations related to disaster
prevention to maintain and enhance the SDF’s disaster
response capability.
e. Other
They also took part in the Ministry of Defense Disaster
Management Headquarters drill, the comprehensive
disaster prevention drills on Disaster Prevention Day,
and more.[5]

**(6) Collaboration with Local Governments and Other**
**Relevant Organizations**

It is important for the MOD/SDF to strengthen
collaboration with local governments and other relevant
organizations under normal circumstances for the purpose
of conducting disaster relief operations smoothly. For this
reason, the SDF implements various measures including:
(1) Assignment of the post of Liaison Officer for Civil
Protection and Disaster Management (administrative
official) at the SDF Provincial Cooperation Offices;
(2) Temporary assignment of SDF officers to the
department in charge of disaster prevention at the
Tokyo Metropolitan Government, and mutual exchange
between administrative officials of both the GSDF
Middle Army and Hyogo Prefectural Government; and
(3) Recommendation of retired SDF personnel with


knowledge in disaster prevention in accordance with
requests from local governments.
As of the end of March 2021, as many as 612 retired
SDF personnel are working in disaster prevention and
other sections in 431 local governments in 46 prefectures
throughout the country. Such cooperation in human
resources is a very effective way of strengthening
collaboration between the MOD/SDF and local
governments, and its efficacy was confirmed through
the experiences of the Great East Japan Earthquake and
other disasters. In particular, each GSDF regional army
establishes a forum for interaction with senior directors
for crisis management and other officials from local
governments, and shares information and exchanges
opinions to strengthen collaboration with those local
governments.
In the event of a disaster, liaison officers are sent quickly
and effectively from the units to the local municipalities
in order to ensure smooth coordination.

See Reference 54 (Employment Situation of Retired Uniformed

SDF Personnel in Disaster Prevention-related Bureaus in Local
Government)

**(7) Actions Based on the Five-Year Acceleration**
**Measures for Disaster Prevention, Mitigation, and**
**Building National Resilience**

In December 2020, the five-year acceleration measures
for disaster prevention, mitigation, and building national
resilience[6] were approved by the Cabinet. Under the
measures, the MOD intensively focuses on measures for
mechanical equipment materials, etc., at SDF airfield
facilities and others, measures for enhancing the SDF’s
infrastructure, and measures for strengthening the SDF’s
buildings, etc., from the perspective of maintaining and
strengthening functions including important infrastructure
for disaster prevention.

**3 Impact on Various Trainings due to Disaster**
**Relief Activities**

Large-scale and long-term disaster relief activities have
been increasing in recent years, and originally planned
training cannot be conducted during these disaster relief
activities, which sometimes hinders the maintenance and
improvements in unit training expected in training plans.
In the future, the MOD/SDF will make the utmost
effort to respond to life-saving activities during the


In addition, the following drills were conducted and participated in, in 2019: (1) government tabletop drills, (2) the Nuclear Energy Disaster Prevention Drill, (3) the large tsunami disaster prevention drill,
(4) a drill related to the Comprehensive Disaster Prevention Drill of Nine Prefectural and City Governments, (5) a drill related to the joint disaster drill among the Kinki prefectures, (6) comprehensive
disaster prevention drills conducted by local governments or other bodies.

In recent years, the Heavy Rain in July 2018, Typhoon Jebi in 2018, the Hokkaido Eastern Iburi Earthquake in 2018 and other natural disasters caused function loss of important infrastructures
necessary for living and economic activities of the people, including the occurrence of blackouts and closure of airport terminals, which had a major effect on the activities. Learning from the
experience, the Emergency Countermeasures stipulate physical and non-physical measures that individual ministries and agencies should implement intensively for the period of three years from the

initial response, and with regards to the various types
of emergency assistance, etc., the MOD/SDF will
coordinate the role sharing, response guidelines, activity
periods, and utilization of private companies, etc., with
the relevant parties such as local governments and the
relevant ministries and agencies. The posture will be
shifted as needed, and activities will be carried out at an
appropriate posture and scale.

**2** **Response to Rescue and Transport of Japanese Nationals Overseas, etc.**

**1 Basic Concept**

In the event of natural disasters, insurgencies, and other
emergencies overseas, the Minister of Defense can order
SDF units to rescue or transport Japanese nationals and
other people overseas upon request from the Minister
for Foreign Affairs to guard, rescue or transport
Japanese nationals overseas, etc., and upon subsequent
consultations with the Minister, on the basis of the
provisions of Article 84-3 (rescue Japanese nationals


overseas, etc.) or Article 84-4 (transport of Japanese
nationals overseas, etc.) of the SDF Law.


For training that could not be conducted during
disaster relief activities, the initial training plan will be
reviewed after the disaster relief activities are concluded,
and measures will be taken to conduct training at other
opportunities. In doing so, the SDF will strive to maintain
the unit’s skills.

Troops), p. 468

exercise in Japan for the rescue of Japanese nationals
overseas to practice the whole process of the actions
and coordination with related organizations, in order
to enhance integrated operational capabilities and to
strengthen the coordination with the related organizations.
The MOD/SDF has conducted the transportation
of Japanese nationals in four cases. Responding to
the kidnapping of foreigners and Japanese in Iraq, 10
Japanese evacuated to Kuwait by an ASDF C-130H
plane in April 2004. In January 2013, a government
aircraft was deployed to bring seven Japanese nationals
and the remains of a further nine nationals back to Japan
following the kidnapping in Algeria. With respect to the
terrorist attack in Dhaka, Bangladesh, which occurred
in July 2016, the bodies of Japanese victims (seven
nationals), their families, and other involved parties were
transported to Japan by a government aircraft.
In relation to the deterioration of the situation in South
Sudan in July of the same year, the ASDF transport
aircraft C-130H transported four embassy staff from Juba
to Djibouti.

See Part II, Chapter 5, 3-6 (Rescue and Transportation of Japanese

Nationals Overseas), p. 238


**2 Initiatives of the MOD/SDF**

For prompt and appropriate implementation of rescue
or transport of Japanese nationals overseas, the SDF
is prepared to dispatch its units swiftly. Specifically,
the SDF maintains operational readiness, with the
GSDF designating personnel to a helicopter unit and
a unit responsible for land transportation, the MSDF
designating vessels such as transport ships (including
ship-based aircraft), and the ASDF designating airlift
units and personnel for dispatch.
Since these activities require close coordination among
the GSDF, MSDF and ASDF, the MOD/SDF constantly
conducts joint exercises. From January to March 2020,
the MOD/SDF also utilized the opportunity of the annual
multilateral exercise Cobra Gold taking place in Thailand
in a series of activities to protect Japanese nationals
overseas in cooperation with the relevant ministries and
the Embassy of Japan in Thailand. With the participation
of Japanese nationals in Thailand, the exercise
strengthened the collaboration between the MOD/SDF
and the Ministry of Foreign Affairs. Furthermore, from
November to December 2020, the SDF conducted an

**3 Responding to Global Issues**

The Japan-U.S. Security Arrangements are the foundation
for a comprehensive and friendly cooperative relationship
between Japan and the United States, not only in defense
but also in a wide range of areas, including politics,
economy, and society.
The Japan-U.S. Alliance, with the Japan-U.S.
Security Arrangements at its core, also forms the axis of
Japan’s foreign policy. It contributes to Japan’s ability
to implement positive efforts to maintain the peace
and security of the international community, including
the promotion of multinational security dialogue and
cooperation, and cooperation with the United Nations.
Currently, we are confronted with global security
challenges that are difficult for any single country to
tackle alone, including risks concerning stable use of
the seas, outer space and cyberspace, the acts of piracy,
proliferation of weapons of mass destruction and ballistic
missiles, and international terrorism, and it is important
for countries to work together from peacetime. The strong
bonds forged between Japan and the United States are
also playing an important role in the efforts implemented
by Japan to effectively respond to such challenges.
In particular, under the Japan-U.S. Security
Arrangements, the SDF and the U.S. Forces are working
together in peacetime in a variety of areas to strengthen
their cooperation. This close coordination lays the
foundation for various forms of global collaboration
such as counter-piracy, undertaken by the SDF and the
U.S. Forces, and leads to enhancement of the operational
effectiveness of the Japan-U.S. Security Arrangements.
The peace and prosperity of the international
community are closely linked to those of Japan.
Accordingly, by advancing initiatives for resolving global
issues in cooperation with the United States, which has
remarkable operational capabilities, Japan will be able to
further ensure its security and prosperity


**2 Maintenance of Peace and Stability in**
**the Region surrounding Japan**

Article 6 of the Japan-U.S. Security Treaty states
that contributing to the security of Japan and the
maintenance of international peace and security in the
Far East is the purpose of the use of facilities and areas
by the USFJ. This provision is based on the recognition
that the security of Japan is closely tied to the peace and
security of the Far East region to which Japan belongs.
In the regions surrounding Japan, there are many states
and the like with massive military power, including some
states that retain nuclear weapons or continue nuclear
development. In addition, uncertainty over the existing
order is increasing due to changes in the balance of
power. The so-called gray-zone situations harbor the
risk of rapidly developing into graver situations without
showing clear indications.
In such a security environment, the military presence
of USFJ provides deterrence against unexpected
contingencies caused by various security issues or
destabilizing factors, not only protecting the interests of
Japan and the United States but also providing a great
sense of security to the nations in the region and thus
fulfilling a role as public goods.
Also, the close bonds of cooperation based on the JapanU.S. Security Arrangements constitute the foundation of
the United States’ commitment to the peace and stability
of the region surrounding Japan. These arrangements,
complemented by the alliances established between the
United States and other countries in the region such as the
Republic of Korea (ROK), Australia, Thailand, and the
Philippines, and also by the friendly relations developed
with other countries, play an indispensable role in
maintaining the peace and stability of the region

**2** **Content of the Guidelines for Japan-U.S. Defense Cooperation**


The “Guidelines for Japan-U.S. Defense Cooperation”
(the Guidelines), which show the general outline and
policy direction of roles and cooperation between Japan
and the United States, were formulated in 1978, and
successively revised in 1997 and 2015.
The current Guidelines, which were revised in 2015,
update the general framework and policy direction for
the roles and missions of the two countries, as well as
modernizing the Alliance. The Guidelines also manifest
a strategic vision for a more robust Alliance and greater
shared responsibilities by enhancing its deterrence and
response capabilities in all phases, from peacetime to
contingencies.

**the Alliance**


**(1) Establishment of the Alliance Coordination**
**Mechanism (ACM)**

In November 2015, the Japanese and U.S. Governments
established the ACM in order to seamlessly and
effectively address any situation that affects Japan’s
peace and security or any other situation that may require
an Alliance response.
Based on the framework shown in Fig. III-2-1-3,
the ACM coordinates policy and operational aspects
related to activities conducted by the SDF and the U.S.
Forces in all phases from peacetime to contingencies.
This mechanism also contributes to timely information
sharing as well as to the development and maintenance
of common situational awareness.
The characteristics of the mechanism include
that (1) it is the standing mechanism utilizable from
peacetime; (2) it can be utilized for large-scale natural
disasters in Japan as well as for cooperation in the
Indo-Pacific region and globally; and (3) it enables

national defense-oriented policy and its three non-nuclear principles.
D The Guidelines do not obligate either government to take legislative, budgetary, administrative, or other measures. However, the two
governments are expected to reflect in an appropriate way the results of these efforts, in their specific policies and measures.

Effective bilateral cooperation under the Guidelines will require the two governments to conduct close, consultative dialogue and sound policy
and operational coordination from peacetime to contingencies. For this purpose, the two governments will establish a new, standing Alliance
Coordination Mechanism, enhance operational coordination, and strengthen bilateral planning.
A Alliance Coordination Mechanism
In order to address issues seamlessly and effectively any situation that affects Japan’s peace and security or any other situation that may
require an Alliance response, the two governments will utilize the Alliance Coordination Mechanism, and will strengthen policy and operational
coordination related to activities conducted by the SDF and the United States Armed Forces in all phases from peacetime to contingencies.

III. Strengthened Alliance

The two governments will establish necessary procedures and infrastructure (including facilities as well as information and communication

Coordination

systems) and conduct regular training and exercises.
B Enhanced Operational Coordination
The two governments recognize the importance of collocating operational coordination functions. The SDF and the United States Armed Forces
will exchange personnel to ensure robust information sharing, to facilitate coordination and to support international activities.

involvement of relevant Japanese and U.S. organizations.
These characteristics enable the Japanese and U.S.
Governments to respond appropriately and promptly
when the need for coordination arises. For example,
in the event of a largescale natural disaster in Japan, it
would require a diversity of coordination in the policy
and operational aspects related to activities of the SDF
and the U.S. Forces. The utilization of this mechanism
makes it possible to conduct close and appropriate
coordination with the involvement of relevant Japanese
and U.S. organizations at various levels.

The Guidelines also require both countries: to cooperate
in international activities and promote and improve
trilateral and multilateral cooperation for regional and
global peace and security; to make cooperation on space
and cyberspace; and to develop and enhance bilateral
enterprise through defense equipment and technology
cooperation as well as intelligence cooperation

**3** **Policy Consultations between Japan and the United States**


Japan and the United States have maintained close
coordination at multiple levels, including the summit
level and ministerial level, and have continually
strengthened and expanded cooperative relations for
the peace, stability and prosperity of not only the two
countries but also the entire international community,
including the Indo-Pacific region.
Close policy consultations on security are conducted
through diplomatic channels as well as between officials
in charge of defense and foreign affairs at multiple levels
in the Governments of Japan and the United States through
meetings such as the Japan-United States SCC (“2+2”
Meeting), the SSC and the Subcommittee for Defense
Cooperation (SDC). As the framework for ministerial
consultations among the top officials in charge of defense
and foreign affairs of the two countries, the SCC (“2+2”
Meeting) represents such policy consultations. The SCC
functions as an important consultative panel to discuss issues
related to Japan-U.S. cooperation in the area of security.
In addition, the Ministry of Defense (MOD) organizes
Japan-U.S. defense ministerial meetings between the
Japanese Minister of Defense and the U.S. Secretary of
Defense as necessary where discussions are made with a
focus on the defense policies of the respective governments
and defense cooperation. Furthermore, the Japanese State
Minister of Defense and the U.S. Deputy Secretary of
Defense work together, and MOD officials, including the
Administrative Vice-Minister of Defense, the Chief of
Staff of the Joint Staff, the Vice-Minister of Defense for


International Affairs, and the Chiefs of Staff of the SDF,
have working-level meetings when necessary and exchange
information with the U.S. Department of Defense (DoD)
and others under the Japan-U.S. Security Arrangements.
The sharing of information and views at every
opportunity and level between Japan and the United States
is undoubtedly conducive to the increased credibility of
the Japan-U.S. Security Arrangements, and results in
the further enhancement of close collaboration between
the two countries. Therefore, the MOD is proactively
engaging in these initiatives.

Bilateral training and exercises in peacetime not only

**3** **Bilateral Training and Exercises**

contribute greatly to maintaining and enhancing
the bilateral response capabilities by improving
interoperability including mutual understanding of tactics
and communication, but are also beneficial for improving
tactical skills for each participant. In particular, the
knowledge and techniques that the Japanese side learns
from the U.S. Forces, which have vast experience in
actual fighting, are invaluable and greatly contribute to
improving SDF capabilities.
In addition, conducting bilateral training at effective
times, places, and scales demonstrates the unified
commitment and capabilities of Japan and the United
States, which has a deterrent effect. In light of these
perspectives, the MOD/SDF is continuing its initiatives
to enrich the contents of bilateral training and exercises


Bilateral training has been expanded not only within
Japan but also to the United States by dispatching SDF
units there. Continuous efforts are being made to enhance
interoperability and Japan-U.S. bilateral response
capabilities at the military branch and unit levels, including
the Japan-U.S. bilateral regional army command post
exercises, special anti-submarine exercises, and JapanU.S. bilateral fighter combat training.
Since FY1985, mostly on an annual basis, command
post exercises and field training exercises have been
conducted alternately as the Japan-U.S. bilateral joint
exercise. From October to November 2020, about
37,000 Ground, Maritime and Air Self-Defense Forces
personnel, about 20 ships, and about 170 aircraft
participated in the Keen Edge 21 field exercises in sea
and air spaces surrounding Japan Tanegashima Island

addition, the ASDF is conducting a variety of training
with U.S. Air Force B-52 bombers and B-1 bombers,
etc., in the Sea of Japan, in the East China Sea, and in the
airspace around Okinawa.
These series of bilateral training were conducted
with the aim of enhancing the tactical skills of the SDF
and bolstering collaboration with the U.S. Forces. It is
believed that strengthening Japan-U.S. collaboration
and demonstrating the bilateral ties as an outcome
will effectively enhance the deterrence and response
capabilities of the overall Japan-U.S. Alliance further
and demonstrate Japan’s determination and high capacity
towards stabilizing the region in the increasingly severe
security environment surrounding Japan.
In recent years, the USFJ have also participated in
disaster drills organized by local governments, thereby
deepening cooperation with relevant institutions and
local governments.

various occasions such as bilateral training and exercises

international disaster relief activities, and armed attack

In the aftermath of the Great East Japan Earthquake in

**7** **Cooperation in Response to a Large-Scale Disaster in Japan**

2011, the SDF and the U.S. Forces demonstrated their
high-level joint response capabilities based on the
strong ties they had developed. The success of the joint
response between the SDF and the U.S. Forces through
Operation Tomodachi was the result of Japan-U.S.
Bilateral Training and Exercises over many years, and
will lead to the Alliance being deepened further in the
future. Operation Tomodachi involved the deployment
of a large-scale force at its peak, including troops of
approximately 16,000 personnel, around 15 ships, and
around 140 aircraft, resulting in relief activities that
were unprecedented in scale and contributing greatly to
Japan’s restoration and reconstruction. Not only those
affected but numerous Japanese at large were filled with
a deepened sense of appreciation and trust for the USFJ.
On the other hand, some issues have emerged, such
as clarifying the roles, missions and capabilities of
Japan and the United States in the event of a disaster
within Japan, as well as stipulating more concrete joint
guidelines to facilitate greater participation by the U.S.


Forces in disaster prevention drills, and examining
mechanisms for the sharing of information and more
effective coordination mechanism.
In light of these issues, the December 2013 Response
Plan for a Massive Earthquake in the Nankai Trough
listed the Japan-U.S. Joint Response Plan, and the two
countries have conducted several bilateral comprehensive
disaster prevention training aimed at maintaining and
enhancing earthquake disaster handling capabilities to
be demonstrated through collaboration between the SDF,
USFJ, related ministries and agencies, and related local
governments in the event of the occurrence of a Nankai
Trough earthquake.
In response to the Kumamoto Earthquake in 2016,
Japan-U.S. cooperation was manifested in the form of the
transportation of daily necessities by the Osprey (MV-22)
of the U.S. Marine Corps and the transportation of SDF
personnel by C-130 transport aircraft. The ACM was
utilized on that occasion, including the Japan-U.S. Joint
Coordination Office locally established by the joint task
force organized for the earthquake response.

number of facilities in Okinawa, including Naha Air
Base of the ASDF, and most of them are located in urban
areas, which results in operational limitations. The joint/
shared use of facilities and areas of the USFJ in Okinawa
will greatly improve the SDF’s training environment
in Okinawa, and facilitate implementation of bilateral/
multilateral training and exercises and expanded
interoperability between the SDF and the U.S. Forces. It
will also improve readiness and contribute to ensuring
the safety of local people in case of a disaster.
Thus, while taking into account the SDF defense posture
in the regions, including the Southwestern Islands, and
relations with local communities, Japan and the United
States are proactively engaged in consultations, and
specific initiatives are steadily progressing. For example,
the GSDF has been using Camp Hansen since March
2008 for training. Moreover, the relocation of the Air
Defense Command Headquarters to Yokota in April 2012
and the relocation of the then GSDF Central Readiness
Force Headquarters to Zama in March 2013 were carried
out. In addition, the development of training ranges in
Guam and the Northern Mariana Islands (Tinian Island,
Pagan Island, etc.) for shared use by the SDF and the U.S.
Forces is under consideration.


**Chapter**


The expansion of joint/shared use of facilities and areas
also means increasing bases for the SDF’s activities
such as maneuver areas, ports, and airfields, which in
turn enables closer operational coordination, expanded
interoperability, and improved flexibility and resilience

**(5) The Revision of the Guidelines Regarding Off-Base**
**U.S. Military Aircraft Accidents**

In July 2019, the governments of Japan and the United
States agreed on the revision of the Guidelines Regarding
Aircraft Accidents in Japan.[4] This revision aims to refine
the procedures for access to the site by Japanese and
U.S. government officials in the event of off-base U.S.
military aircraft accidents that occur in Japan, and so on.
These changes enable more effective, expeditious and
proper response to future U.S. military aircraft accidents.

Japan, working as clerks at headquarters, engineers
at maintenance/supply facilities, members of security
guards and fire departments on base, and sales staff at
welfare/recreational facilities. They support the smooth
operations of the USFJ.
The Government of Japan hires these USFJ employees
in accordance with the provisions of the SOFA. The
MOD supports the stationing of the USFJ by performing
administrative work for personnel management, payment
of wages, health care, and welfare, etc.

**(3) Supplementary Agreement on Cooperation in the**
**Field of Environmental Stewardship**

In September 2015, the governments of Japan and the
United States signed and effectuated the Agreement on
Cooperation in the Field of Environmental Stewardship
relating to the USFJ, supplementary to the SOFA. This
supplementary agreement represents an international
commitment with legal binding force and sets forth
provisions concerning the issuance and maintenance of
the Japan Environmental Governing Standards (JEGS)
and the establishment and maintenance, etc., of procedures
for access to USFJ facilities and areas. This agreement
was the first of its kind created to supplement the SOFA
since the SOFA had entered into force and has a historical
significance that differs essentially in nature from
conventional improvements in the operations of the SOFA.

See Part IV, Chapter 5, Section 2-2 (Efforts on the USFJ Facilities

See

and Areas), p. 491


USFJ-related costs include cost sharing for the stationing
of USFJ, costs for implementing the stipulations of
the SACO Final Report to mitigate the impact on the
people of Okinawa, as well as costs for implementing
measures that contribute to mitigating the impact on the
local communities associated with the initiatives for the
realignment of the U.S. Forces.

See Fig. III-2-4-1 (USFJ-Related Costs [Budget for FY2021])

**4 Host Nation Support (HNS)**


**Chapter**


HNS plays an important role to ensure the smooth and
effective implementation of the Japan-U.S. Security
Arrangements. Due to soaring prices and wages in Japan
since the mid-1970s, and changes in the international
economic situation, Japan began to bear labor costs such
as welfare costs for USFJ local employees in FY1978.
Then in FY1979, it started to bear costs for the Facilities
Improvement Program (FIP).
Furthermore, as labor costs soared due to changes in
economic conditions surrounding both countries, there
arose a concern that the employment stability of the
employees would be undermined, and then the activities
of the USFJ could be affected. Therefore, in 1987, Japan
and the United States concluded an agreement that
sets forth special measures regarding Article 24 of the
SOFA (the Special Measures Agreement, or SMA)[5] as
exceptional, limited, and provisional measures relating to
the cost sharing principle of the SOFA.
Based on this SMA, Japan started to bear labor costs
of eight categories such as the adjustment allowance
(currently replaced by the regional allowance). As the
SMA was revised later on, the costs shared by Japan
expanded to cover labor costs including base pay, and
utilities costs from FY1991, and training relocation costs
from FY1996.


**(4) Supplementary Agreement on Civilian Component**
In January 2017, the governments of Japan and the
United States signed the Supplementary Agreement on
Civilian Component, which came into force on the same
day. This Supplementary Agreement clarifies the scope
of the civilian component, which is addressed only by
a general provision in SOFA, in addition to developing
criteria used in evaluating contractor employee positions
for eligibility to receive designation as members of the
civilian component, and stipulates the procedures for
notification and review, etc., together with the exclusion
of ordinary residents from the civilian component. The
initiative to formulate the Supplementary Agreement
on Civilian Component is the second case, following
the creation of the Supplementary Agreement on the
Environment that supplements the SOFA.

been on a steady decline after peaking out in the FY1999
budget on an expenditure basis.

agreed to extend the current SMA for one year, and also
confirmed that negotiations would be continued towards
the agreement of a new SMA beyond April 1, 2022. In
addition, on February 24, 2021, the Protocol Amending
the SMA was signed to extend the validity period of the
current SMA by one year. After the approval by the Diet,
the Protocol Amending the SMA came into effect on
March 31, 2021, and the validity period of the current
SMA was extended by one year.

See Fig. III-2-4-2 (Japan’s Share under the Current SMA Extended

by the Protocol Amending the SMA)


Based on the fact that the current SMA was valid until
the end of March 2021 and as a result of discussions
between Japan and the United States, on February 17,
2021, the Governments of Japan and the United States

**2** **Progress of the Realignment of the USFJ**


“The United States-Japan Roadmap for Realignment
Implementation” (Roadmap) was set forth in May 2006.
Subsequently, the following factors were set forth:
(1) The necessity of implementing measures to realize
visible mitigation of the impact on Okinawa promptly and
steadily; (2) The necessity of balancing the realignment
package and the strategic rebalance to the Asia-Pacific
region, which was set out in the U.S. Defense Strategic
Guidance released in January 2012; and (3) The
reduction in the cost associated with the relocation of
the U.S. Marine Corps to Guam demanded by the U.S.
congress. Full-fledged consultation on the coordination
of the realignment package took place between the two
countries in light of those factors. The achievements
thereof were announced as part of the Joint Statements of
the “2+2” Meeting and through other means.
The 2006 Roadmap stated that, among the III Marine

In comparison to areas such as the U.S. mainland,

**3** **Stationing of the U.S. Forces in Okinawa**

Hawaii, and Guam, Okinawa is located closer to potential
conflict areas that could affect Japan’s peace and security,
including the Korean Peninsula and the Taiwan Strait, but
at the same time has the advantage of having a certain
distance from these areas that would not heighten military
tension there unnecessarily. In addition, Okinawa,
comprising a large number of small islands, is located
roughly in the center of the Southwestern Islands having
a total length of some 1,200 km and close to key sea lanes
for Japan, which depends on marine transportation for
over 99% of its overall international trade. Furthermore,
its location is extremely important from the perspective
of security, as Okinawa serves as a strategically important
target for neighboring countries in both making access to
the Pacific from the continent and rejecting access from
the Pacific to the continent.
Thus, the stationing of the U.S. Forces in Okinawa,
including the U.S. Marine Corps, which can deal
with a wide range of missions with high mobility and
readiness, along with the above-mentioned geographical
characteristics, further ensures the effectiveness of
the Japan-U.S. Alliance, strengthens deterrence, and
contributes greatly not only to the security of Japan but
also to the peace and stability of the Indo-Pacific region.
On the other hand, Okinawa has many USFJ facilities
and areas such as air bases, maneuver areas and
logistics facilities. As of January 1, 2021, approximately
70% of USFJ facilities and areas (for exclusive use)


Expeditionary Force (MEF) stationed in Okinawa, the
main focus of the relocation to Guam would be the
command elements, but at the “2+2” Meeting in April
2012, the United States decided to alter the composition
of the units and to deploy the Marine Air-Ground Task
Force (MAGTF)—consisting of command, ground,
aviation and logistics support elements—in Japan, Guam,
and Hawaii, as well as in Australia as a rotational unit. In
addition, the governments of Japan and the United States
decided to delink both the relocation of U.S. Marine
Corps personnel from Okinawa to Guam and the resulting
land returns south of Kadena Air Base from the progress
on the Futenma Replacement Facility (FRF).

are concentrated in Okinawa Prefecture, occupying
approximately 8% of the land area of the prefecture
and approximately 14% of the main island of Okinawa.
Therefore, it is necessary to make utmost efforts to
mitigate the impact on Okinawa, while also considering
the above-mentioned security standpoints.

**1 Initiatives for Realignment, Consolidation,**
**and Reduction of USFJ Facilities and Areas**
**in Okinawa**

When Okinawa was returned to Japan in 1972, the
Government of Japan provided 83 facilities and areas
covering approximately 278 km[2] for exclusive use as USFJ
facilities and areas. On the other hand, USFJ facilities and
areas were strongly requested to be realigned, consolidated
and reduced, on the grounds that they seriously affect the
lives of people in Okinawa Prefecture.
Both countries have continued their initiatives to
realign, consolidate, and reduce USFJ facilities and areas,
centering on those subject to the strong local requests,
and, in relation to the so-called 23 issues, it was agreed
in 1990 that both sides would proceed with the required
coordination and procedures toward the return of land

**2 Outline of SACO Final Report**


The returned land accounts for approximately 20% of
USFJ facilities and areas (for exclusive use) in Okinawa.
The return is the largest one since the reversion of
Okinawa to the mainland, and had been an issue for 20
years since the SACO Final Report in 1996.
Based on the Act on Special Measures Concerning
Promotion of Effective and Appropriate Use of the
Lands in Okinawa Prefecture Previously Provided for
Use by the Stationed Forces, the MOD took measures
to remove obstacles (such as soil contamination survey,
etc.) so that the landowners, etc., could use returned lands
effectively and appropriately, and transferred the land to
the landowners in December 2017.

**4 Relocation and Return of MCAS Futenma**


The SACO Final Report stipulates the return of land,
the adjustment of training and operational procedures,
noise reduction, and the improvement of operational
procedures regarding the SOFA procedures, and also
refers to the related facilities and areas covered. The land
to be returned based on the SACO Final Report represents
approximately 21% (about 50 km[2]) of USFJ facilities and
areas in Okinawa at that time, exceeding the amount of
land returned during the period between the reversion
of Okinawa and the implementation of the SACO Final
Report, which is roughly 43 km[2].

**3 Return of a Major Portion of the Northern**
**Training Area**


In May 2006, along with the initiatives set forth in the
Roadmap related to the realignment of the U.S. Forces,
the measures have been implemented to alleviate the
impact on the local communities in Okinawa while
maintaining the deterrence capabilities.
The Government of Japan believes that it is imperative
not to allow MCAS Futenma to remain indefinitely at
its current location, which is in the vicinity of houses,
schools, etc., in the center of Ginowan City, Okinawa
Prefecture, and considers that this is a fundamental idea
shared between the Government of Japan and the people
of Okinawa.
As for the relocation of MCAS Futenma, the Government
of Japan has not changed its stance that the current plan to
construct the FRF at the Camp Schwab Henokosaki area
(Nago City) and adjacent waters is the only solution to
avoid the continued use of MCAS Futenma.
The Government of Japan will make further efforts to
achieve the relocation and return of MCAS Futenma as
early as possible and to mitigate the impact on Okinawa
in a speedy manner The return of MCAS Futenma is


The condition for returning the Northern Training Area
was to relocate seven helipads in the area to be returned to
the preexisting training area. However, the Government
of Japan reached an agreement with the U.S. side to give
considerations for the natural environment and to relocate
not all seven but the minimum number of six helipads
necessary, and proceeded with the construction work. The
relocation of the helipads completed in December 2016,
and the return of approximately 4,000 ha, a major portion
of the Northern Training Area located in the villages of
Kunigami and Higashi, was achieved based on the SACO
Final Report


-----

expected to eliminate danger in the area and to contribute
to the further growth of Okinawa, including Ginowan
City, through the reuse of the area (approximately 476 ha
with a land area 100 times larger than Tokyo Dome).

**(1) Background Concerning the Futenma Replacement**
**Facility**

Considering the occurrence of the U.S. Forces helicopter
crash in Ginowan City in August 2004, bilateral
discussions on the realignment have been made towards
realizing the relocation and return of MCAS Futenma at
the earliest possible date in order to resolve the concern
of the residents living in the vicinity.
In the SCC (“2+2”) document compiled in October
2005, the initiative to “locate the FRF in ‘L’-shaped
configuration that combines the shoreline areas of Camp
Schwab and adjacent water areas of Oura Bay” was
approved. However, since this L-shape meant that U.S.
military aircraft would fly over settlements in Nago City
and Ginoza Village, a request was submitted to avoid
flights over these settlements.
In light of this, based on negotiation and agreement
with the local municipalities including Nago City, it
was decided to stipulate in the Roadmap that the FRF
be located in a V-shape configuration that “combines
Henokosaki and adjacent water areas of Oura and Henoko
Bays.” With regard to construction of this replacement
facility, “a Memorandum of Basic Understanding” was
exchanged between the then Governor of Okinawa
Inamine and the then Minister of State for Defense
Nukaga in May 2006.
After the change of government in September 2009,
the Exploratory Committee for Okinawa Base Issues was
established. After reviews conducted by the Committee,
both governments, at the “2+2” Meeting held in May
2010, confirmed the intention to locate the FRF in
the Camp Schwab Henokosaki area and the adjacent
waters, and decided that a study by experts regarding
the replacement facility’s location, configuration and
construction method would be completed promptly.
The two sides also agreed to take concrete measures to
mitigate the impact on Okinawa. Subsequently, at the
“2+2” Meeting held in June 2011, it was decided that the
runway would take a V-shape.
During the deliberation process which led to these
conclusions, first of all, it was determined that, from a
security perspective, the deterrence of the U.S. Forces,
including that of the U.S. Marine Corps stationed in
Okinawa that is located in a crucial area for the security
of Japan, cannot be lessened while there remains
instability and uncertainty in the security environment
in East Asia. Furthermore, concern was expressed that
the functions of the U S Marine Corps such as mobility


and readiness would be weakened if the helicopter
units stationed at MCAS Futenma were to be detached
from the other Marine units stationed in Okinawa and
moved abroad or out of the prefecture. Therefore, it
was concluded that the FRF had to be located within
Okinawa Prefecture.
Also at the “2+2” Meetings in April 2012, October
2013, April 2015, August 2017, April 2019, and March
2021, and in other instances including the joint statement
issued at the Japan-U.S. summit meeting in February
and November 2017, April 2018, and April 2021, the
governments of Japan and the United States confirmed
that the plan to construct the FRF at Camp Schwab
Henokosaki area and adjacent waters is the only solution
that avoids the continued use of MCAS Futenma.

Facility)
Reference 26 (Estimated Timelines for the Return of Facilities
and Areas South of Kadena)
Fig. III-2-4-8 (Comparison between the Replacement Facility
and MCAS Futenma [image])

**(2) Relocation of MCAS Futenma and Mitigation of the**
**Impact on Okinawa**

The relocation of MCAS Futenma holds more
significance than merely moving the facility from one
location to another. Rather, it involves reduction in the
base’s functions and area in Okinawa, and contributes
greatly to mitigating the impact on Okinawa.

MCAS Futenma fulfills the following functions relating
to the aviation capabilities of the U.S. Marine Corps
stationed in Okinawa: (1) Operation of the Osprey and
other aircraft; (2) Operation of air refueling aircraft; and
(3) Accepting transient aircraft in contingencies. Of these
three functions, only “(1) operation of the Osprey and
other aircraft” will be relocated to Camp Schwab. As for
“(2) operation of air refueling aircraft,” all 15 KC-130
air refueling aircraft were relocated to MCAS Iwakuni
(in Iwakuni City, Yamaguchi Prefecture) in August 2014.
This marked the completion of a task that has remained
unresolved for 18 years since the SACO Final Report
in 1996, enabling a vast majority of fixed-wing aircraft
located in MCAS Futenma to be moved outside Okinawa
Prefecture. This move also led to the relocation of
approximately 870 USFJ personnel, civilian employees,
and dependents.
Moreover, the function of “(3) accepting transient
aircraft in contingencies” will also be transferred to
Tsuiki Air Base and Nyutabaru Air Base. In October
2018, Japan and the United States agreed on developing
facilities that would be necessary for relocating the
function, and related work such as construction of the
facilities has been carried out

b. Reduction in Area
The area required for the land reclamation to build the
FRF is approximately 150 ha, less than one-third of the
approximately 476 ha of MCAS Futenma, and the FRF
will be equipped with a significantly shorter runway at
1,200 m (1,800 m including the overruns) compared to
the current runway length of 2,740 m at MCAS Futenma.
c. Reduction in Noise and Risks
Two runways will be constructed in a V-shape, which
enables the flight path for takeoff and landing to be
located over the sea, in line with the requests of the
local community. In MCAS Futenma, flight paths used
daily for training and other purposes are located over
residential areas, whereas flight paths in the FRF will be
changed to over the sea, thereby reducing noise and risks.
For example, while more than 10,000 households are
located in areas requiring housing noise insulation near
MCAS Futenma, there will be zero households requiring
such insulation around the FRF. This means that the noise
levels experienced by all households will comply with the
environment criteria applied to exclusive housing areas.
In the case that an aircraft encounters any contingency,
safety on the ground can be ensured by diverting the
aircraft offshore.


**(3) The Necessity of Constructing the FRF in Okinawa**
**Prefecture**

The U.S. Maritime Corps in Okinawa consists of air,
ground, logistics, and command elements. The interaction
of those elements is indispensable for U.S. Marine Corps
operations characterized by great mobility and readiness,
so the FRF needs to be located within Okinawa Prefecture
so that rotary-wing aircraft stationed at MCAS Futenma
will be located near the elements with which they train,
operate, or otherwise work on a regular basis.

**(4) Completion of Environmental Impact Assessment**
**Procedures**

The MOD sent the environmental impact assessment
scoping document in 2007 to the Governor of Okinawa
and other parties. After the MOD worked on revising
the document based on the opinions provided by the
governor, the MOD completed the environmental impact
assessment procedures by sending the revised assessment
document to related parties including the governor in
December 2012, while making the assessment document
available for public review.
Throughout these procedures, the MOD received a total
of 1,561 opinions from the Governor of Okinawa on six
occasions, made all the required revisions, and reflected
them in the content of the environmental assessment.
In this way, the MOD had taken steps to comply with
relevant laws, asked opinions and ideas from Okinawa
Prefecture over a sufficient period of time, and reflected
them in the assessment


-----

**(5) Promotion of the FRF Construction Project**
a. Suits over the Revocation of the Landfill Permit
The Director General of the Okinawa Defense Bureau
submitted the landfill permit request on public waters to
Okinawa Prefecture in March 2013, and then Governor
of Okinawa Nakaima approved this in December 2013.
However, then Governor of Okinawa Onaga revoked the
landfill permit in October 2015, leading to the filing of three
suits over the revocation of the landfill permit between the
Government of Japan and Okinawa Prefecture.[6]

Under these circumstances, the court came up with
a settlement recommendation, and the Government of
Japan and Okinawa Prefecture reached a court-mediated
settlement agreement in March 2016. In the settlement,
the Government of Japan and Okinawa mutually affirmed
that after the final judicial ruling is handed down by the
Supreme Court, they would abide by the ruling and take
steps in line with the spirit of the text of the ruling and
the reasons conducive to the text, and continue to take
responses in good faith by cooperating with each other in
accordance with the purpose of the ruling.
Pursuant to the provisions of the settlement agreement,
the Okinawa Defense Bureau immediately suspended the
landfill work while the Minister of Land, Infrastructure,
Transport and Tourism issued an instruction for correction
based on the Local Autonomy Act to then Governor
Onaga to repeal the revocation of the landfill permit.
Subsequently, in December 2016, after examination by
the Central and Local Government Dispute Management
Council and deliberation by the Naha Branch of the
Fukuoka High Court, the Supreme Court set forth the
decision that the revocation of the landfill permit by then
Governor Onaga was illegal.
b. Judgment of the Supreme Court
In the judgment, the Supreme Court ruled that then
Governor Nakaima’s decision was not illegal. The court
stated that no circumstances could be found indicating
that then Governor Nakaima’s decision that the landfill
was in compliance with the condition in Article 4
(1) (i) of the Act on Reclamation of Publicly-owned Water
Surface, “that it is appropriate and reasonable as the use
of national land,” had no foundation in fact, or clearly
lacked reasoning under socially accepted conventions.
The reasons given by the court include: (1) the area of
the replacement facilities and the landfill area will be
significantly reduced from the area of the MCAS Futenma
facilities, and (2) flights over residential areas by aircraft
can be avoided by the landfill in the coastal area that puts


the runway extension out to sea.
Moreover, regarding whether the construction of
replacement facilities takes environmental protection and
other considerations into adequate account, the Supreme
Court, finding that construction methods, environmental
protection measures and countermeasures that can
conceivably be taken at this point in time have been
taken and that there is sufficient consideration for disaster
prevention. The Supreme Court determined that it cannot
be said that then Governor Nakaima’s decision was illegal.
The court did not find that there was anything particularly
unreasonable in then Governor Nakaima’s decisionmaking process and the content of the decision that the
construction met the condition of Article 4 (1) (ii) of the
Act on Reclamation of Publicly-owned Water Surface,
“the landfill gives sufficient consideration to the protection
of the environment and prevention of disasters.”
c. Retraction of the Revocation of the Landfill Permit
Following this Supreme Court ruling, in December 2016,
then Governor Onaga retracted the revocation of the
landfill permit and the Okinawa Defense Bureau resumed
the replacement facilities construction project. In April
2017, it started the construction of the seawall, the main
part of the public waters reclamation.
d. Suit Related to Damage to the Reefs on the Seafloor, etc.
In July 2017, Okinawa Prefecture filed a suit in the Naha
District Court, requesting that this seawall construction
not be allowed to damage to the reefs on the seafloor, etc.,
without permission from the Governor of Okinawa based
on the regulations of Okinawa Prefecture. Subsequently,
the district court dismissed Okinawa Prefecture’s claim
in March 2018, and the Naha Branch of the Fukuoka
High Court dismissed Okinawa Prefecture’s appeal in
December of the same year. In the same month, Okinawa
Prefecture filed a petition of final appeal with the Supreme
Court, but withdrew the petition in March 2019.
e. Situation Surrounding the Landfill Work
In August 2018, Okinawa Prefecture revoked the landfill
permit again on the basis of problems concerning
environmental protection measures and the soil
foundation of the landfill area. In October of the same
year, the Director General of Okinawa Defense Bureau
filed a request with the Minister of Land, Infrastructure,
Transport and Tourism for a stay of execution under
the Administrative Complaint Review Act against the
revocation of the permit, and the stay of execution was
upheld. Following the ruling, the Okinawa Defense
Bureau started the landfill operation in December of

Okinawa Defense Bureau submitted to the Governor
of Okinawa Prefecture the Landfill Permit Revision
Request given the additional implementation of the soil
improvement work, etc., based on the Act on Reclamation
of Publicly-owned Water Surface.
In February 2019, Okinawa Prefecture held a
referendum on whether or not to support the landfill
work related to the relocation of MCAS Futenma to
the Henokosaki area in Nago City. As a result, 114,933
voters voted for the work, 434,273 voters voted against
it, and 52,682 voters voted neither (the total number
of votes cast was 605,385 and the voter turnout was
52.48%). The present situation in which U.S. bases are
concentrated in Okinawa is in no way acceptable, and it
is a grave responsibility of the government to mitigate
the impact on Okinawa. The government takes the
results of the prefectural referendum seriously and will
continue to do its utmost to mitigate the impact of the
U.S. bases in Okinawa.
It is imperative to prevent MCAS Futenma, which
is surrounded by houses and schools and which is
said to be the most dangerous base in the world, from
continuing to be used indefinitely and to pose a danger.
The government believes that this view is shared with the
people of Okinawa.
The relocation to Henoko does not mean that all
functions of MCAS Futenma will be relocated there. Of
MCAS Futenma’s three functions, two will be moved out
of Okinawa while the remaining one will be relocated
to Henoko, resulting in the total return of the site of
MCAS Futenma. Indeed, from the viewpoint of sharing
the impact, progress is being made in implementation of
measures to realize the total return of the site of MCAS
Futenma based on understanding and cooperation by local
public entities outside Okinawa. The measures include
the relocation of air refueling aircraft to Yamaguchi
Prefecture and the relocation of the function of accepting
transient aircraft in contingencies to Fukuoka and
Miyazaki Prefectures.
Although 25 years have passed since Japan and the
United States agreed on the total return of the site of
MCAS Futenma, it has not been achieved yet. The MOD
believes that the return must not be postponed any longer.
The Government of Japan intends to continue making
efforts to secure the understanding of local residents in
Okinawa through years of persistent dialogue, and do its
utmost to achieve the total return of MCAS Futenma as
early as possible.

**5 Force Reduction and Relocation to Guam**


series of consultations on the reduction of the U.S.
Forces in Okinawa.

**(1) Timing and Size of Relocation**
The 2006 Roadmap stated that approximately 8,000
personnel of the III MEF and their approximate 9,000
dependents would relocate from Okinawa to Guam by
2014, but the “2+2” Meeting in June 2011 and other
agreements set the timing of the relocation for the earliest
possible date after 2014.
Subsequently, at the “2+2” Meeting held in April 2012,
the governments of Japan and the United States decided
to delink both the relocation of III MEF personnel from
Okinawa to Guam and the resulting land return south of
Kadena Air Base from the progress on the FRF and to
adjust the composition of the units and the number of
personnel to be relocated to Guam.
As a result, MAGTF is to locate in Japan, Guam, and
Hawaii, approximately 9,000 personnel are to be relocated
to locations outside of Japan (about 4,000 of whom are
to be relocated to Guam), the authorized strength of the
U.S. Marine Corps forces in Guam is to be approximately
5,000 personnel, and an end-state for the U.S. Marine
Corps presence in Okinawa is to be consistent with the
level of approximately 10,000 personnel envisioned in
the Roadmap.
Accordingly, the “2+2” Meeting held in October 2013
agreed that, under the relocation plan described at the
2012 “2+2” Meeting, the relocation of U.S. Marine Corps
units from Okinawa to Guam is to begin in the first half
of the 2020s. The plan is expected to facilitate progress
in implementing the consolidation plan for facilities and
areas in Okinawa of April 2013.


**Chapter**


**(2) Costs of the Relocation**
Under the Roadmap, the two sides reached an
agreement that, of the estimated US$10.27 billion (in
U.S. fiscal year 2008 dollars) cost of the facilities and
infrastructure development costs, Japan would provide
US$6.09 billion, including US$2.8 billion in direct
cash contribution, while the United States would fund
the remaining US$4.18 billion. In February 2009, the
Japanese Government and the U.S. Government signed
“the Agreement Between the Government of Japan
and the Government of the United States of America
Concerning the Implementation of the Relocation of the
III MEF Personnel and Their Dependents from Okinawa
to Guam” (the Guam International Agreement). The
Agreement legally guarantees and ensures actions taken
by Japan and the United States for projects to which
Japan provides direct cash contributions.
As part of measures based on this Agreement,
the Japanese Government has been providing cash


Since the Roadmap was announced in May 2006, the
governments of Japan and the United States held a


-----

contributions to the U.S. Government in relation to the
projects for which Japan has provided financial support
since FY2009.[9]

Subsequently, at the “2+2” Meeting held in April 2012,
the unit composition and the number of personnel to be
relocated to Guam were adjusted and it was agreed that the
preliminary cost estimate by the U.S. Government for the
relocation was US$8.6 billion (in U.S. FY2012 dollars).
With regard to Japan’s financial commitment, it was
reaffirmed that it was to be the direct cash contribution of
up to US$2.8 billion (in U.S. FY2008 dollars) as stipulated
in Article 1 of the Guam International Agreement. It was
also confirmed that Japan’s equity investment and loans
for family housing projects and infrastructure projects
would not be utilized.[10]

Moreover, it was stipulated that any funds that had
already been provided to the U.S. Government under
the Guam International Agreement would be counted
as part of the Japanese contribution. Furthermore, as a
new initiative, a portion of the direct cash contribution
of US$2.8 billion mentioned above would be used to
develop training areas in Guam and the Commonwealth
of the Northern Mariana Islands as shared-use facilities
by Japan and the United States. In addition, it was agreed
that the remaining costs and any additional costs would be
borne by the United States, and that the two governments
were to complete a bilateral cost breakdown.
At the “2+2” Meeting in October 2013, a Protocol
Amending the Guam International Agreement was also
signed to add the stipulations concerning the development
of training areas in Guam and the Commonwealth of the
Northern Mariana Islands, and the use of these training
areas by the SDF. The limit on Japanese cash contributions
remains unchanged at US$2.8 billion (in U.S. FY2008
dollars). Both countries also completed work reflecting
the breakdown of the associated costs.
Furthermore, the National Defense Authorization Act
for U.S. FY2015 was enacted in December 2014, which
lifted the freeze on the use of funds for the relocation to
Guam imposed by the U.S. Congress in U.S. FY2012.

**(3) Completion of Environmental Impact Assessment**
**Procedures**

As for the environmental impact assessment for Guam,
the required procedures were conducted to reflect the
revisions to the project made by the adjustments to the
plan for realignment, and the assessment was completed
in August 2015.
Furthermore, the Commonwealth of the Northern


Mariana Islands Joint Military Training Environmental
Impact Statement (CJMT-EIS), is now being implemented.

**(4) Progress of the Guam Relocation Project**
While the environmental impact assessment for Guam
was being conducted, the Government of the United States
implemented infrastructure development projects at the
Andersen Air Force Base and the Apra area of the Naval
Base Guam as projects unaffected by the assessment. The
U.S. Government is currently implementing relocation
construction work in all project areas, following the
lifting of the freeze on the Guam relocation funds
pursuant to the National Defense Authorization Act and
the completion of the environmental impact assessment
for Guam.

**6 Return of Land Areas South of Kadena Air Base**

The May 2006 Roadmap stated that, following the
relocation to the FRF, the return of MCAS Futenma, and
the transfer of III MEF personnel to Guam, the remaining
facilities and areas on Okinawa will be consolidated,
thereby enabling the return of significant land areas south
of Kadena Air Base.
Subsequently, at the “2+2” Meeting in April 2012, it
was decided to delink the progress on the relocation to the
FRF from both the relocation of the III MEF personnel
from Okinawa to Guam and the resulting land returns
south of Kadena. In addition, with regard to the land
to be returned, it was agreed to conduct consultations
focusing on three categories, namely (1) land eligible for
immediate return; (2) land eligible for return once the
relocation of functions is completed; and (3) land eligible
for return after the relocation abroad.


**(1) Consolidation Plan for Facilities and Areas in Okinawa**
Since the change of administration at the end of 2012,
Japan and the United States have continued consultation
under the basic policy of the Abe administration to
dedicate all its strength to mitigate the impact of the
U.S. Forces on Okinawa communities. Japan strongly
requested an early return of land areas south of Kadena,
including Makiminato Service Area (Camp Kinser) in
Urasoe City of which Okinawa has particularly made a
strong request for the return and coordinated with the
United States. As a result, both countries announced the
Consolidation Plan for Facilities and Areas in Okinawa
(Consolidation Plan) in April 2013, which stipulated the

**(2) Progress in the Return of Land**
Efforts have been made to enable the early return
of land areas, including the land areas that are to
be returned as soon as required procedures are
completed (shown in red in Fig. III-2-4-12), since the
announcement of the Consolidation Plan in April 2013.
At the end of March 2020, portions of land at Camp
Zukeran (Warehouse Area of Facilities and Engineering
Compound) (approximately 11 ha) were returned, and,
as a result, the return of all “immediate return” areas in
the Consolidation Plan was realized. In addition, returns
were realized ahead of the schedule in the Consolidation
Plan for some areas where there were strong demands
for return by the local community.
All-out initiatives are being continuously made by
the government to steadily implement the return of land
areas south of Kadena Air Base under the Consolidation
Plan and to realize the respective returns of land in the
shortest possible time for more visible mitigation of the
impact on Okinawa.

Osprey is an aircraft that combines the vertical takeoff/
landing and hovering functions of rotary-wing aircraft
and the flight speed and range of fixed-wing aircraft.
As a primary asset of the marine air unit, the MV-22,
specified for the U.S. Marine Corps, plays an important
role in engaging in a broad range of activities, including
transportation of personnel and supplies.
The U.S. Marine Corps replaced aged rotary-wing
aircraft (CH-46) with MV-22s, which have superior basic
performance. In September 2013, all the 24 CH-46s
deployed at MCAS Futenma were replaced by MV-22s.
The MV-22 is a highly capable aircraft compared with
the CH-46; on its flight speed, payload and flight range.
Its deployment to Okinawa strengthens the deterrence of
the overall USFJ and greatly contributes to the peace and
stability of the region.

**(2) Deployment of CV-22 Osprey by the U.S. Air Force**
**to Yokota Air Base**

In May 2015, the United States announced that CV-22,
specified for the U.S. Air Force, would be deployed
to Yokota Air Base (which encompasses Fussa City,
Tachikawa City, Akishima City, Musashi Murayama City,
Hamura City and Mizuho Town of Tokyo Prefecture) A


total of 10 CV-22 Ospreys are scheduled to be deployed
in stages by around 2024, with the first five CV-22s
deployed to Yokota Air Base in October 2018.
The CV-22 deployed to Yokota Air Base plays a role
in transporting personnel and supplies of the special
operation units of the U.S. Forces to address crises
and emergencies in the Asia-Pacific region including


-----

humanitarian assistance and natural disasters.
As Japan faces an increasingly severe security
environment, the deployment of high-performance CV-22
enhances the deterrence and response capabilities of the
Japan-U.S. Alliance and contributes to the defense of
Japan and the stability of the region from the perspective
of the commitment by the U.S. to the Asia-Pacific region
and the building-up of readiness by the United States.

**(3) Safety of Osprey**
Prior to the deployment of MV-22s to MCAS Futenma
in 2012, Japan established an analysis and assessment
team composed of aircraft pilots and experts from
inside and outside the government and confirmed the
safety of MV-22 by conducting its own survey, etc. In
addition, when Japan made the decision to introduce
Ospreys in 2014, the government reconfirmed their
safety by collecting and analyzing all kinds of technical
information, not only in the preparation phase, but also
after the decision of introduction.
The MOD has dispatched the GSDF Osprey
personnel to the U.S. Marine Corps’ training programs
since the fall of 2016. The personnel who piloted
and maintained the aircraft are of the opinion that
the Osprey is a reliable aircraft that allows for stable
maneuvering and maintenance.
Additionally, the CV-22 has the same propulsion
system as the MV-22 and both aircraft also have a basic
structure in common; therefore the safety of both aircraft
is at the same level.
Japan considers that ensuring safety is of prime
importance in operations of the U.S. Forces, and on
various occasions, the Minister of Defense requested the
Secretary of Defense and other high-ranking officials
to give consideration to local communities and ensure
safety. The Government of Japan will continue to ask for
the maximum consideration for safety.

See Reference 27 (Chronology of Osprey Deployment by the U.S.

See

Forces)


ROK. Furthermore, in response to the large earthquake
that hit Nepal in April 2015, four MV-22s deployed in
Okinawa were dispatched to the country to transport
personnel and supplies.
In Japan as well, when the Kumamoto Earthquake
occurred in 2016, MV-22s were dispatched to deliver
daily necessities to the disaster-stricken areas.
In this manner, the MV-22 is capable of conducting
humanitarian assistance and disaster relief activities
immediately and over a large range when large-scale
disasters occur because of its high performance and
multifunctionality. It has also been used for disaster
prevention drills since 2014. In September 2016, two
MV-22s participated in the comprehensive disaster
prevention drills of Sasebo City, Nagasaki Prefecture and
conducted delivery drills for isolated islands. Like the
MV-22, the CV-22 can conduct humanitarian assistance
and disaster relief activities, including search and rescue
missions, both immediately and over a large range, in the
case of a large-scale disaster.
As such, it is expected that the superior capabilities of
the Osprey deployed by the U.S. Forces can be showcased
in a variety of operations in the future as well.

**8 Consultation Structures for Mitigating**
**the Impact of Bases on Okinawa**


**Chapter**


In order to mitigate the concentrated impact on Okinawa,
the Government of Japan has been committed to
further mitigating the impact, listening to, for example,
the opinions of the local residents through various
consultative bodies.

See Fig. III-2-4-14 (Consultative Bodies on the Mitigation of Impact

of Bases on Okinawa)

**9 Initiatives for the Use of Lands Previously**
**Provided for Use by the Stationed Forces**


The Act on Special Measures Concerning Promotion of
Effective and Appropriate Use of the Lands in Okinawa
Prefecture Previously Provided for Use by the Stationed
Forces stipulates various measures concerning lands in
Okinawa provided for use by the USFJ (“USFJ Land”)
agreed to be returned. The MOD mainly conducts the
following initiatives, and will continue its initiatives to
promote the effective and appropriate use of returned lands
by coordinating and cooperating with related ministries, the
prefectural government and local municipalities. The MOD:
(1) conducts mediation in relation to access for surveys,
etc., to be implemented by the prefectural government
and local municipalities on the USFJ Land which are
agreed to be returned;


**(4) Usability of Osprey Deployed by the U.S. Forces in**
**Case of Disaster**

In the aftermath of the devastating typhoon that hit the
central part of the Philippines in November 2013, 14
MV-22 aircraft, deployed in Okinawa, were dispatched
for humanitarian assistance and disaster relief activities to
support Operation Damayan. The MV-22s were deployed
promptly to affected areas that were difficult to access,
and transported several hundred isolated victims and
about six tons of relief materials in a day. In April 2014,
the MV-22, deployed in Okinawa, was dispatched for
search and rescue activities in the wake of an accidental
sinking of a passenger ship off the coast of Jindo in the

The headquarters of U.S. Army Japan (USARJ) at Camp
Zama (Sagamihara City and Zama City in Kanagawa
Prefecture) was reorganized into the headquarters of
the USARJ & I Corps (Forward) in December 2007.
The subsequent reorganization project to improve the
capabilities of the U.S. Army Headquarters in Japan is
shown in Figure III-2-4-16.
The Ground Component Command HQ has set up the
Japan-U.S. Joint Headquarters at Camp Zama to ensure
close communication and coordination with the USARJ
as well as swift response to various events.

See Fig. III-2-4-17 (Initiatives for Improvement of U.S. Army Japan

Command and Control Capability and Mitigation of Impact)


**Chapter**


**1 Realignment of USFJ Facilities and Areas in**
**Kanagawa Prefecture**

With regard to the realignment of USFJ facilities and
areas in Kanagawa Prefecture, etc., the return of facilities
and areas including the Kamiseya Communication
Station and the Fukaya Communication Site has already
been realized based on the Japan-U.S. Joint Committee
agreement of October 2004.
However, more than 10 years have passed since the
initial agreement, and Japan’s security environment has
become increasingly severe. Therefore, there have been
changes in the U.S. Navy’s posture and capabilities, as
represented by the increased operation of U.S. vessels
at Commander Fleet Activities, Yokosuka. In light of
such circumstances, the following were agreed at the
Japan-U.S. Joint Committee meeting in November 2018:
(1) development of facilities for satisfying the U.S. Navy’s
facility requirements; (2) start of negotiation on joint
use of the Negishi Dependent Housing Area to conduct
site restoration works; and (3) cancellation of the plan to
construct family housing in the Yokohama City area of
the Ikego Housing Area and Navy Annex. Subsequently,
joint use of the Negishi Dependent Housing Area was
agreed upon at the Japan-U.S. Joint Committee meeting in
November 2019.

**(2) Yokota Air Base and Airspace**
a. Commencement of the Operation of the Bilateral
Joint Operations Coordination Center (BJOCC) and
the Relocation of ASDF Air Defense Command
Headquarters (HQ)
Enhancement of coordination between the headquarters
of both countries, combined with the transition to joint
operational posture, is highly important to ensure a
response with flexibility and readiness of the SDF
and the U.S. Forces. Therefore, at the end of FY2011,
the BJOCC commenced its operations at Yokota Air
Base and the Air Defense Command HQ[12] and its
relevant units were relocated to Yokota Air Base.
These arrangements have made it possible to enhance
coordination between the headquarters of the SDF and
the U.S. Forces, including the sharing of information
concerning air defense and BMD.
b. Yokota Airspace
To facilitate the operations of civilian aircraft in Yokota
airspace, where the U.S. Forces conduct radar approach
control, measures have been taken since 2006 to
temporarily transfer the responsibility for air traffic


12 The BJOCC functions to contribute to providing a joint response for Japan’s defense. To that end, it works to enhance information sharing, close coordination, and interoperability between the Japanese

the airspace by about 40% (i.e., the release of air traffic
control from USFJ).
c. Civilian-Military Dual Use of Yokota Air Base
At the Japan-U.S. summit meeting held in May 2003, it
was agreed that the joint civilian-military use of Yokota
Air Base would be studied, and a Liaison Conference
was then established as a working panel attended by
relevant government ministries and agencies and the
Tokyo Metropolitan Government. The governments
of Japan and the United States are also conducting a
study on the specific conditions and modalities, with the
understanding that both countries will not compromise
the military operations and safety of Yokota Air Base.


aircraft carrier provides the core capability of the Fleet.
The U.S. Navy affirms that it will continue to ensure
that all of its forward-deployed nuclear-powered vessels,
including USS “Ronald Reagan,”[13] which anchored at
Commander Fleet Activities, Yokosuka (Yokosuka City,
Kanagawa Prefecture), adhere to the relevant safety
policies. For example, the nuclear reactor will normally
be shut down while the aircraft carrier is anchored, and
repairing and refueling will not be carried out in Japan.
The Government of Japan will continue taking all
possible measures to ensure safety.

**(4) Measures Relating to Naval Air Facility Atsugi and**
**MCAS Iwakuni**

a. Relocation of Carrier-Based Aircraft
Since Naval Air Facility Atsugi (Ayase City and Yamato
City in Kanagawa Prefecture) is located in an urban
district, the noise of carrier jets taking off and landing in
particular had been a problem for a long time.
Thus, after the completion of the runway relocation
project[14] at MCAS Iwakuni (Iwakuni City, Yamaguchi
Prefecture), which made aircraft operations possible with

less impact on the living environment of the surrounding
communities, it was decided that CVW-5 squadrons would
be relocated from Naval Air Facility Atsugi to MCAS
Iwakuni. The relocation began in August 2017 and completed
in March 2018. As a result, the noise in areas around Naval
Air Facility Atsugi was alleviated to a significant extent,
while maintaining the forward deployment of a U.S. aircraft
carrier and carrier-based aircraft.
In order to mitigate impacts of the increased operations at
MCAS Iwakuni due to the relocation, the related measures
listed in Fig. III-2-4-18 have been implemented. If all of
these measures are fully implemented, the noise problems
are expected to be mitigated from the current situation,
with the area requiring residential noise-abatement work,
or the so-called first category area, decreasing from
approximately 1,600 ha to approximately 650 ha.

See Fig. III-2-4-18 (Overview of and Measures Related to Naval Air

See

Facility Atsugi and MCAS Iwakuni)

b. Field-Carrier Landing Practice (FCLP)
The May 2006 Roadmap prescribes that a bilateral
framework to conduct a study on a permanent FCLP facility
is to be established with the goal of selecting a permanent
site at the earliest possible date. Since December 2019,
the MOD has acquired approximately 90% of the land on
Mageshima in Nishinoomote City, Kagoshima Prefecture,
has been conducting various surveys in preparation for
the development of SDF facilities, and has been taking
measures such as holding briefing sessions for residents
on the progress of the surveys, starting the procedures for
the environmental impact assessment in February 2021,
and implementing a demonstration flight by the ASDF
fighter aircraft in May of the same year. This SDF facility
will be used to support operations in response to a variety
of situations, including large-scale disasters, as well as
regular exercises and other activities, including use by
the U.S. Forces as a permanent FCLP facility.
In addition, the 2005 SCC document confirmed that


the U.S. Forces will continue to conduct FCLP at IwoTo in accordance with existing temporary arrangements
until a permanent training facility is identified.
c. Resumption of Civil Aviation Operations at MCAS Iwakuni
Considering that the local public entities, etc., including
Yamaguchi Prefecture and Iwakuni City, had been
working together to request the resumption of civil
aviation operations, it was agreed in the Roadmap
that “portions of the future civilian air facility will
be accommodated at MCAS Iwakuni.” Based on this
agreement, Iwakuni Kintaikyo Airport was opened in
December 2012, resuming regular flights of civil aviation
aircraft for the first time in 48 years.

**(5) Ballistic Missile Defense (BMD)**
In June 2006, an AN/TPY-2 radar (so-called “X-Band
Radar”) system was deployed to the U.S. Shariki
Communication Site (Tsugaru City in Aomori Prefecture).[15]
Also in October 2006, U.S. Army Patriot PAC-3 units
(Patriot Advanced Capability) were deployed to Kadena
Air Base (Kadena Town, Okinawa City and Chatan Town
in Okinawa Prefecture) and Kadena Ammunition Storage
Area (Yomitan Village, Okinawa City, Kadena Town,
Onna Village and Uruma City in Okinawa Prefecture). In
December 2014, the second AN/TPY-2 radar in Japan was
deployed to the U.S. Kyogamisaki Communication Site
(Kyotango City in Kyoto Prefecture).
The United States deployed Aegis destroyers with
BMD capabilities to Commander Fleet Activities,
Yokosuka in October 2015, March 2016 and May 2018.

See Chapter 1, Section 2-2-1 (Japan’s Comprehensive Air and

Missile Defense Capability), p. 265


**(6) Training Relocation**
a. Aviation Training Relocation (ATR)
Based on the decision that U.S. aircraft from three USFJ
facilities and areas—Kadena, Misawa (Misawa City


-----

and Tohoku Town in Aomori Prefecture) and MCAS
Iwakuni—would participate for the time being in
bilateral training at SDF facilities, the Aviation Training
Relocation (ATR)[16] has been underway since 2007. The
MOD has been improving its infrastructure, as required,
for the training relocation.

See Fig. III-2-4-19 (Overview of the Background to the Aviation

See

Training Relocation)

The ATR contributes to enhancing interoperability
between the two countries, and also to relocating part
of air-to-ground training conducted by using Kadena
Air Base. Thus, this training relocation will help noise
abatement around Kadena Air Base, thereby contributing
to the mitigation of the impact on Okinawa.
In addition to assisting the USFJ, the MOD/SDF
is making efforts to ensure the safety and security of
the local community, such as the establishment of a
liaison office, facilitating communication with related
government agencies, and response to requirements from
the local community. These efforts have been contributing
to successful training relocation.
b. Training Relocation for MV-22
The Government of Japan and the United States
Government decided in the “2+2” joint statement of
October 2013, to utilize the opportunities to participate
in various operations in mainland Japan and across
the region to reduce the amount of time that MV-22s
are deployed and used for the training in Okinawa so
that training outside of Okinawa Prefecture, including
mainland Japan, can be increased while maintaining
the deterrence of the Alliance. Based on above, both
governments have been moving forward with the training
of the MV-22 deployed at MCAS Futenma outside of
Okinawa Prefecture, etc.

In order to smoothly implement the realignment of the

**5** **Initiatives for Smooth Implementation of the Realignment of the USFJ**

USFJ based on the May 2006 Roadmap, the Act on Special
Measures on Smooth Implementation of the Realignment
of United States Forces in Japan (USFJ Realignment
Special Measures Act) was enacted in August 2007.
Realignment grants, Special Subsidy Rates for Public
Projects, etc., and other systems were established based
on the law.
In addition, under the U.S. Forces realignment, some
USFJ facilities and areas will be returned, and the U.S.
Marine Corps in Okinawa will be relocated to Guam.
Since these developments may affect the employment


|Fig. III-2-4-19|Overview of the Background to the Aviation Training Relocation|
|---|---|
|Time of reaching agreements|Overview|
|May 2006|In the “Japan-U.S. Roadmap for Realignment Implementation,” it is conformed that U.S. aircraft from three USFJ facilities and areas—Kadena, Misawa and MCAS Iwakuni—would participate in bilateral training with the SDF at SDF facilities in Chitose, Misawa, Hyakuri, Komatsu, Tsuiki, and Nyutabaru.|
|January and October 2011|At the Joint Committee, both governments agreed to include Guam as a new training relocation site and to expand the scale of training.|
|March 2014|At the Joint Committee, both governments agreed to add air-to-ground training using the Misawa Air-to- Ground Range (Misawa City and Rokkasho Village in Aomori Prefecture).|


In September 2016, it was agreed at the Joint
Committee to relocate the training activities of TiltRotor/Rotary Wing aircraft, such as AH-1, CH53, and the
MV-22 that are currently deployed at MCAS Futenma
out of Okinawa Prefecture at Japan’s expense in order to
further promote training outside of Okinawa to mitigate
the impact of training activities there.
Two bilateral training were conducted in FY2020 (in
Kagoshima prefecture from October to November 2020,
and in Gunma and Niigata prefectures in December
2020). From the date of the agreement up to March 2021,
a total of 12 training, in addition to the ones mentioned
above, have been conducted in Guam and in Japan at
the exercise sites in Hokkaido, Miyagi, Shiga, Kagawa,
Kumamoto, Oita, and Miyazaki prefectures.
The MV-22’s amount of time deployed and training
in Okinawa will continue to be reduced by relocating
exercises held in mainland of Japan and Guam, and the
government will continue to promote initiatives that
contribute to further mitigating the impact on Okinawa.

of USFJ employees, the Government of Japan will take
measures to include education and skills training, which
is to help retain their employment.
The Realignment Special Measures Act was supposed
to cease to be effective as of March 31, 2017. However,
since there remain realignment projects that require
implementation, on March 31, 2017, an act revising part
of the Act including a 10-year extension of the time limit
of the Act to March 31, 2027 was enacted.

The MOD/SDF has long strived to alleviate any
conditions of confrontation and tension, and to foster a
collaborative and cooperative relationship by building
face-to-face relationships through bilateral dialogues
and exchanges. In addition, the MOD/SDF has
recently enhanced bilateral defense relationships from
traditional exchanges to deeper cooperation in a phased
manner by appropriately combining various means,
including bilateral/multilateral training and exercises,
capacity building, defense equipment and technology
cooperation, and the development of institutional
frameworks such as the Acquisition and Cross-Servicing
Agreements (ACSA).
In addition, multilateral regional security cooperation
and dialogue are in the process of evolving from those
that focus on dialogue to those that focus on cooperation
that seeks to build regional order. It is important to
promote bilateral and multilateral defense cooperation
and exchanges in a multilayered, practical manner in
order to create an ideal security environment.
Due to the spread of the COVID-19, the MOD has held
more telephone conversations and video teleconferences
than before. The MOD deepens communication with
foreign countries and continues to strategically promote
defense cooperation and exchanges even from the
government office in Ichigaya, Tokyo.

promoting defense cooperation and exchanges to
ensure that Japan can secure the stable use of major sea
lanes. In addition, the MOD/SDF is promoting mutual
understanding and confidence building with countries
that modernize their military forces and intensify their
military activities to prevent contingencies and ensure
Japan’s security. Furthermore, for countries in the
region that are taking steps to respond to changes in the
environment, the MOD/SDF is trying to contribute to
regional peace and stability by supporting their efforts
through defense cooperation and exchanges.

**(3) Areas with Which Japan Will Enhance Cooperation**
**to Uphold and Reinforce FOIP**

With respect to Southeast Asia, South Asia, Pacific Island
countries, the Middle East, Africa, and Latin American
countries, the MOD/SDF will enhance cooperation to
uphold and reinforce FOIP, utilizing a wide range of
means for defense cooperation and exchanges, including
cooperation and exchange of personnel, cooperation
and exchange of troops, capacity building, and defense
equipment and technology cooperation.
Specifically, the MOD/SDF is promoting defense
cooperation and exchanges to help countries in these
regions to play more effective roles in achieving stability
in the Indo-Pacific region, and to secure the stable use
of sea lanes by establishing good relations with these
countries and ensuring that the SDF has stable access to
their ports and airports.


**Chapter**


**(4) Countries with Which Japan Works to Uphold and**
**Reinforce FOIP**

The United States as Japan’s ally, Australia, India, the
United Kingdom, France, Germany and other European
countries, Canada and New Zealand are countries that
not only share fundamental values with us, but also have
geographic and historical ties to the Indo-Pacific region.
The MOD/SDF has been encouraging these countries
to become more involved in the Indo-Pacific region. At
the same time, the MOD/SDF has also been promoting
defense cooperation and exchanges with them so that we
can work together as partners when promoting efforts
for upholding and reinforcing FOIP in the areas listed in
(3) above. This way, we aim to achieve stronger effects
than when promoting efforts on our own.

**(5) Expansion of FOIP**
As Japan promotes defense cooperation and exchanges
based on its vision of FOIP, the United States, Australia,
ASEAN, India, and European countries such as the
United Kingdom, France and Germany have their own
initiatives and visions in the Indo-Pacific region, which
are consistent with our vision of FOIP Japan’s vision


**(1) Characteristics of the Indo-Pacific Region**
Free and open maritime order, which relies on the rule
of law, is the foundation for the stability and prosperity
of the international community. The Indo-Pacific region
is at the core of the world vitality, and home to half the
world’s population. It is important to establish this region
as a free and open global commons to ensure the peace
and prosperity of the entire region.
On the other hand, a range of challenges exist for
upholding and reinforcing FOIP in the region, including
in Japan’s vicinity, such as a rapid modernization of
military forces and intensified military activities.

Defense cooperation and exchanges

“Defense cooperation and exchanges” refers to efforts to strengthen bilateral and multilateral defense relations by using various tools, which are significant
initiatives for securing the peace and stability of Japan and the international community.

Purpose of defense cooperation and exchanges

〇 To create a security environment desirable for Japan
〇 To deter threats from reaching Japan by making opponents realize that doing harm to Japan would be difficult and consequential
〇 To prevent contingencies through promoting confidence-building and mutual understanding

Tools for defense cooperation and exchanges


Tool 1: Cooperation and exchanges among people
On such occasions as the “2+2” Meeting, defense ministerial meetings, chief of staff-level meetings or other high-level meetings, working-level
consultations among defense authorities, and multilateral international conferences, participants frankly exchange views on defense policies, regional
situations, defense cooperation and exchanges, etc., thereby developing mutual understanding and building confidence among them and further promoting
defense cooperation and exchanges thereafter. Exchanges of students and interchange in education and research aim to facilitate understanding of defense
policies and statuses of military units of other countries and promote relations of trust through network building.

Tool 2: Cooperation and exchanges among troops
Through goodwill exercise, mutual visits of naval ships and aircraft (calling at ports and airports), and exchange events among units, mutual trust with
partner countries is developed and cooperative relationships are promoted. Bilateral and multilateral exercises aim to enhance SDF’s capability to cooperate
with troops of other countries and strengthen defense relations among relevant countries, in addition to improve personnel’s skills.

relationship with Australia, a “Special Strategic Partner”
that has both the intention and ability to contribute to
the maintenance of peace and stability in the region, to
deepen cooperation that further improves interoperability.

**(2) Recent Major Achievements in Defense**
**Cooperation and Exchanges**

In November 2020, Prime Minister Suga held a summit
meeting with the Prime Minister of Australia, Scott
Morrison, in Tokyo, where the leaders determined
to elevate bilateral security and defense cooperation
under the Special Strategic Partnership to a new level.
In this regard, the leaders reiterated their strong belief
that the reciprocal access agreement between Japan and
Australia (“Japan-Australia RAA”)[4] will serve as a solid
foundation for further enhancing strategic cooperation
between the two countries, and welcomed the agreement
in principle reached between the two countries on the
Japan-Australia RAA.
In May and October that same year, Minister of Defense
Kono and Minister of Defense Kishi held telephone
conversations with Minister for Defence Linda Reynolds.
The ministers exchanged views on regional issues,
including the East China Sea and the South China Sea,
and shared the view to continue to strongly promote
Japan-Australia defense cooperation and exchanges to
uphold and reinforce FOIP based on the Special Strategic


**(1) Significance of Defense Cooperation and**
**Exchanges with Australia**

Australia is a “Special Strategic Partner” for Japan in
the Indo-Pacific region as both Japan and Australia are
allied with the United States and share not only universal
values[2] but also security strategic stakes and interests.
In recent years, particularly, Japan and Australia as
responsible countries in the Indo-Pacific region are
strengthening mutual cooperation focusing on areas such
as humanitarian assistance and disaster relief (HA/DR)
activities and cooperation in capacity building.
With the background of the deepening defense
cooperation between Japan and Australia, the two
countries in March 2007 announced the Japan-Australia
Joint Declaration on Security Cooperation, Japan’s first
such joint declaration focusing on security with a country
other than the United States. Japan and Australia have
also developed the foundation for cooperation such as the
Japan-Australia ACSA, the Japan-Australia Information
Security Agreement, and the Agreement concerning the
Transfer of Defence Equipment and Technology.
The Japan-Australia ACSA,[3] which expands the scope
of the mutual provision of supplies and services, was
revised and signed by the two countries in January 2017.
The new ACSA was concluded in light of the expansion of
cases in which the SDF and the Australian Defence Force
(ADF) conduct operations together due to the further
advances in their defense cooperation and exchanges, and
the development of the Legislation for Peace and Security
in Japan. The agreement was approved by the National
Diet in April 2017 and entered into force in September

**(3) Cooperative Relationship, etc., among Japan,**
**Australia and the United States**

Japan and Australia share universal values and cooperate
closely to resolve the various challenges the Indo-Pacific
region and the international community face. In order
to ensure greater effectiveness and efficiency of such
cooperation, and to contribute to the peace and stability
of the region, it is important for Japan and Australia,
and their common ally, the United States, to proactively
promote trilateral cooperation.
The Security and Defense Cooperation Forum
(SDCF), a Director General-level meeting among the
three countries of Japan, the United States and Australia,
has been held 10 times since April 2007.
In July 2020, Minister of Defense Kono held a video
teleconference with U.S. Secretary of Defense Dr. Mark

framework to protect ADF assets by the SDF personnel
under Article 95-2 of the SDF Law (Provision for the
protection of weapons and other equipment of the units
of the U.S. Armed Forces and armed forces of other
foreign countries).
They also reaffirmed their shared commitment to
continue working with Indo-Pacific partners in the fields
of capacity building, maritime security, and HA/DR.
As an example of cooperation and exchange
between services, the Chief of Staff, Joint Staff held a
teleconference with General Angus Campbell, Chief of
the Australian Defence Force, in April 2020, where they
reaffirmed the importance of the Japan-Australia defense
cooperation and exchanges based on FOIP. Senior SDF

met with Vice Admiral Michael Noonan, Chief of Navy,
in August; the Chief of Staff, Air Self-Defense Force
(ASDF) held talks with Air Marshal Mel Hupfeld, Chief
of Air Force, in May, August, and October. Each service
shared the view to continue to cooperate closely in order
to uphold and reinforce FOIP even under the impact of
the COVID-19 pandemic.
In addition, the GSDF accepted an Australian Army
liaison officer in January 2021 for the first time in
Japan, and is promoting the strengthening of mutual
understanding and the deepening of interoperability
through personnel exchange. In September 2020, the
Indo-Pacific Deployment Squadron conducted a bilateral
exercise with Australian forces in the South China Sea.
In November, the Destroyer JS “Shimakaze” conducted
a bilateral exercise in the western waters and airspace of
Kyusyu, and in March 2021, the Destroyer JS “Akebono,”
on ocean training exercises, conducted a bilateral exercise
in the South China Sea to improve tactical skills and
enhance cooperation with the Australian Navy.

**(1) Significance of Defense Cooperation and**
**Exchanges with India**

India is increasing its influence against a backdrop of its
population (the world’s second largest), its high economic
growth, and its latent economic power. Located in the
center of sea lanes that connect Japan with the Middle
East and Africa, India is an extremely important country
for Japan. Furthermore, Japan and India share universal
values as well as common interests in the peace, stability,
and prosperity of Asia and the world, and have established
the “Special Strategic and Global Partnership.” In this
context, Japan and India have promoted cooperation in
maritime security and various other areas, while utilizing
some frameworks including the “2+2” meeting.
Defense cooperation and exchanges between Japan
and India have steadily deepened since October 2008,
when the two countries signed the Joint Declaration on

**3 Association of South-East Asian Nations**
**(ASEAN)**

As ASEAN member states continue to enjoy high
economic growth and draw international attention to their
potential as an open growth center of the world, these
countries and Japan have been traditional partners sharing
a history of exchanges and a close economic relationship
over the past nearly 50 years.
ASEAN nations, located in strategically important
areas occupying strategic points on sea lanes of Japan,
are also playing an important role in ensuring the peace
and prosperity of Japan as well as the entire region.
Therefore, it is important for Japan to further strengthen
cooperation and exchanges in the security and defense
areas and promote confidence with ASEAN member
states, while supporting their efforts to enhance the
centrality, unity, and resilience of ASEAN, which is the
center of regional cooperation.
Based on this principle, Japan is promoting
confidence-building and mutual understanding through
high-level and working-level exchanges as well as
practical cooperation, such as capacity building, bilateral/
multilateral exercises, and defense equipment and
technology cooperation with ASEAN member states. In
addition to bilateral cooperation, Japan has strengthened
cooperation under multilateral frameworks such as the
ASEAN Defence Ministers’ Meeting-Plus (ADMMPlus) and the ASEAN Regional Forum (ARF). The
Vientiane Vision, which was presented as a guideline for
future ASEAN-Japan defense cooperation at the second
ASEAN-Japan Defence Ministers’ Informal Meeting in
November 2016, outlined the full picture of the future
direction of defense cooperation for ASEAN as a whole
in a transparent manner.
In November 2019, at the 5th ASEAN-Japan Defence
Ministers’ Informal Meeting held in Thailand, Defense
Minister Kono announced the Vientiane Vision 2.0, an
updated version of the Vientiane Vision, and ASEAN
ministers welcomed it.
From the viewpoint of actively promoting such
bilateral and multilateral cooperation and stabilizing
the security environment of the Indo-Pacific region, the
MOD will strive to further enhance defense cooperation
and exchanges with ASEAN member states.

Both Japan and the ROK confront wide-ranging and
diverse security challenges, including response to the
nuclear and missile issues of North Korea, response to
large-scale natural disasters, counterterrorism measures,
counter-piracy measures, and maritime security.
On the other hand, issues between the defense
authorities of Japan and the ROK are affecting bilateral
defense cooperation and exchange. Examples include the
ROK’s response to the MSDF’s flags[6] at an international
fleet review ceremony hosted by the ROK in October

2018, the fire-control radar irradiation of an MSDF
aircraft by an ROK Navy destroyer in December 2018,[7]
military exercises by the ROK Navy in the sea surrounding
Takeshima, and the ROK’s termination notification of the
Japan-ROK General Security of Military Information
Agreement (GSOMIA) (however, the termination
notification was later suspended). As the ROK defense
authorities continue to take negative actions, the MOD/
SDF continues to call on the ROK to appropriately deal
with these concerns so as not to impair the cooperation
between Japan and the ROK, and between Japan, the
ROK and the United States.
In November 2019, Defense Minister Kono held
a meeting with Minister of National Defense Jeong
Kyeong-doo on the occasion of the 6th ADMM-Plus.
Defense Minister Kono stated that Japan-ROK bilateral
relations as well as the trilateral relations between
Japan, the ROK and the U.S. are extremely significant
in the severe security environment surrounding Japan
and the ROK although the defense relations between
the two countries have been extremely sour because of
various bilateral issues since 2018. The two Ministers
agreed that the two defense authorities would continue
their communication.

**(2) Japan-U.S.-ROK Cooperative Relationship**
Since Japan, the United States, and the ROK share
common interests pertaining to the peace and stability
of this region, it is important for the three countries
to seize opportunities to promote close cooperation
in addressing various security issues, including those
regarding North Korea.
Japan, the United States, and the ROK have conducted
a Trilateral Defense Ministerial Meeting on the sidelines
of the Shangri-La Dialogue. In June 2019, then Defense
Minister Iwaya, ROK Minister of National Defense Jeong
Kyeong-doo, and then U.S. Acting Secretary of Defense
Patrick Shanahan convened the Trilateral Defense
Ministerial Meeting. The three Ministers recognized
the international community’s shared goal of North
Korea’s full compliance with its international obligations
in accordance with all relevant UN Security Council
Resolutions, which call for North Korea’s complete
denuclearization in a verifiable and irreversible manner.
They underscored commitment to cooperation and
coordination with the international community for
fully implementing UN Security Council Resolutions,
including sustained international cooperation to deter,
disrupt, and ultimately eliminate North Korea’s illicit

ship-to-ship transfers. Regarding regional security
issues, the Ministers reaffirmed that freedom of
navigation and overflight must be ensured, and that
all disputes should be resolved in a peaceful manner
in accordance with the principles of international law.
Based on this view, they shared the recognition of
strengthening security cooperation between Japan, the
United States and the ROK.
At the Japan-U.S.-ROK Defense Ministerial Meeting
held by Defense Minister Kono, ROK Minister
of National Defense Jeong Kyeong-doo, and U.S.
Secretary of Defense Mark Esper on the occasion of the
6th ADMM-Plus in November 2019, the three ministers
committed to further trilateral security cooperation,
including information sharing, high-level policy
consultation, and bilateral/multilateral exercises, based
on the international community’s shared goal, which
calls for North Korea’s complete denuclearization as well
as the abandonment of ballistic missiles in a verifiable
and irreversible manner, North Korea’s full compliance
with its international obligations in accordance with
all relevant UN Security Council Resolutions, and the
importance of a rules-based order.
At the working level, the three countries have cooperated
with each other while closely sharing information through
such opportunities as Director-General and Director
level meetings and video teleconferences based on the
framework of the Japan-U.S.-ROK Defense Trilateral
Talks (DTT), as well as chief-of-staff level meetings.
In May 2020, a plenary meeting of Director-Generals
was held in the form of a video teleconference. The
representatives of the three countries reaffirmed
the importance of trilateral cooperation as well as
cooperation with the international community for the
shared goal of North Korea’s full compliance with

In December 2018, Gwanggaeto-daewarg, the Great class destroyer of the ROK Navy, directed a fire control-radar at a MSDF patrol aircraft conducting warning and surveillance activities off the coast
of Noto Peninsula (within Japan’s exclusive economic zone). Taking the incident seriously, in January 2019, the MOD published its final statement, compiling objective facts, and has been urging the
Korean side to take recurrence prevention measures. The SDF patrol aircraft was flying while keeping sufficient altitude and distance, and did not fly in a way that could have threatened the Korean


-----

its obligations in accordance with all relevant UNSC
resolutions, and also exchanged views on the status of
each country’s response to COVID-19.
As for service-to-service exchange, the Chief of Staff,
JS visited the United States in November to participate in
the Japan-U.S.-ROK chiefs of staff video teleconference.
At this meeting, the Chief of Joint Staff, General Mark
Milley, U.S. Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, and
General Won In-choul, ROK Chairman of the Joint
Chiefs of Staff, discussed trilateral defense cooperation
from the viewpoint of promoting the peace and stability
of Northeast Asia. Also, in September, the MSDF
conducted the Japan-U.S.-Australia-ROK Multilateral
Exercise “Pacific Vanguard 20” in the sea and airspace
around Guam to improve tactical skills and strengthen
cooperation with the navies of each participating country.
The three countries need to enhance their security
cooperation in various areas into the future, taking
advantage of various available opportunities.

**(3) Japan-ROK GSOMIA**
Based on the Trilateral Information Sharing Arrangement
Concerning the Nuclear and Missile Threats Posed by
North Korea signed in December 2014, the defense
authorities in Japan and the ROK have exchanged and
shared classified information regarding North Korea’s
nuclear weapons and missiles via the United States.
In light of the increasingly serious situation surrounding
North Korea with its frequently repeated ballistic missile
launches and nuclear tests, in November 2016, the
GSOMIA was concluded between Japan and the ROK
to further promote bilateral cooperation. This agreement
serves as a framework to appropriately protect classified
military information shared between the Japanese and
ROK governments. In August 2019, the Government
of the ROK notified the Government of Japan of its
intention to terminate the GSOMIA in writing. However,
in November 2019, the ROK Government notified Japan
that it would cease its termination of the agreement.[8]
Minister of Defense Kono commented that Japan-U.S.
and Japan-ROK bilateral cooperation and Japan-U.S.ROK trilateral cooperation are important amid the severe
security environment in East Asia, and that he considered
that the ROK Government made its decision from a
strategic perspective taking into account the current
security situation in the region.

European countries, Canada, and New Zealand share
universal values with Japan and play a central role in
initiatives to address common challenges to global
security, with a primary focus on non-traditional
security areas, such as counter-terrorism and combating
illicit ship-to-ship transfers, as well as international
peace cooperation activities. In this regard, promoting
defense cooperation and exchanges with these countries
provides the foundations for Japan to become actively
involved in dealing with these challenges and this is
important for all of Japan, European countries, Canada,
and New Zealand.

**Chapter**


**(1) The United Kingdom**
The United Kingdom, being a major power that has
influence not only in Europe but also in the rest of the
world, has historically maintained close relations with
Japan. On the security front, Japan shares the same
strategic interests as the United Kingdom, as both
countries are important allies of the United States. Given
this relationship, it is extremely important for Japan
to promote cooperation with the United Kingdom by
working together on global issues, such as international
peace cooperation activities, counterterrorism, counterpiracy operations and cybersecurity as well as by
exchanging information on regional situations.
With regard to Japan’s relationship with the United
Kingdom, the Memorandum on Defence Cooperation
was signed in June 2012. Following this, the Agreement
concerning the Transfer of Defence Equipment and
Technology came into effect in July 2013 and the
Japan-U.K. Information Security Agreement entered
into force in January 2014, leading to the development
of a foundation for defense equipment and technology
cooperation as well as information sharing between the
two countries. At the Japan-U.K. summit meeting in May
2014, the prime ministers of both countries agreed to hold
a Japan-U.K. “2+2” Foreign and Defence Ministerial
Meeting and begin negotiations on the ACSA in order to
enhance bilateral cooperation in the security field.


The provision of the GSOMIA on termination of the agreement is as follows:

ARTICLE 21 ENTRY INTO FORCE, AMENDMENT, DURATION AND TERMINATION (excerpt)

3. This Agreement shall remain in force for a period of one year and shall be automatically extended annually thereafter unless either Party notifies the other in writing through the diplomatic channel

The four ministers affirmed that, at a time when the
security environment surrounding Japan and the U.K. is
undergoing changes, and basic values and principles are
facing challenges, the two countries, as global strategic
partners, would further enhance cooperation towards the
realization of FOIP.
The ministers shared the view to coordinate towards the
implementation of bilateral/multilateral exercises during
this visit by U.K. aircraft carrier “Queen Elizabeth”
and her carrier strike group to the region including East
Asia in 2021, and welcomed the signing of a Maritime
Security Arrangement to further security cooperation
between the MSDF and the British Royal Navy, as well
as the steady progress both on bilateral ground exercises
and on defense equipment and technology cooperation.
Minister of Defense Kishi conveyed his serious
concerns on the China Coast Guard Law, and the four
ministers shared their serious concerns about the situation
in the East China Sea and South China Sea, strongly
opposed unilateral attempts to change the status quo by
force and confirmed the importance of a free and open
maritime order based on the rule of law.
In March, following the announcement of the Integrated
Review of Security, Defence, Development and Foreign
Policy, Minister of Defense Kishi held a telephone
conversation with Secretary of State for Defence Wallace,
and received an explanation of the Integrated Review.
On this occasion, Minister Kishi highly commended the
U.K.’s strategic decision on the “tilt to the Indo-Pacific
region,” which was expressed in the Integrated Review,
and welcomed the Integrated Review as something that
explicitly maps out the direction of a strengthened JapanU.K. cooperative relationship in the mid- to long-term
toward upholding and reinforcing FOIP.
Regarding the East China Sea and the South China
Sea, the two ministers once again expressed their will
to strongly oppose any action which attempts to change
the facts on the ground, coercion, or any activities that
escalate tension regarding the situation, and concurred that
a free and open maritime order based on the rule of law,
in particular the U.N. Convention on the Law of the Sea,
is important. Minister Kishi also expressed the Japanese
serious concerns over the China Coast Guard Law. The
two ministers referred to the launching of two ballistic
missiles by North Korea on the day of the meeting, and
strongly condemned the launches as a threat to the peace
and stability of the region that violates UNSC resolutions,
and shared the view that the repeated launches of ballistic
missiles by North Korea thus far is a serious challenge to
the international community as a whole.


Japan-U.K. Foreign and Defence Ministers’ Meeting (“2+2”) conducted online (February 2021)

In January 2017, the Japan-U.K. ACSA[9] was signed.
After the approval by Japan’s National Diet in April
2017, the ACSA entered into force in August. Relevant
domestic laws were then developed. The effectuation
of the Japan-U.K. ACSA enables the two countries to
implement the mutual provision of supplies and services,
such as water, food, fuel and transportation, between
the SDF and the U.K. Armed Forces through unified
procedures in bilateral exercises and large-scale disaster
relief operations, further facilitating and strengthening
the Japan-U.K. strategic partnership.
The Japan-U.K. Joint Declaration on Security
Cooperation, issued during the Japan-U.K. summit
meeting in August 2017, stipulated that the two countries
agreed to develop an action plan with specific measures
relating to bilateral security cooperation between the
relevant authorities. At the Japan-U.K. summit meeting
in January 2019, the leaders reaffirmed the above
Declaration and confirmed that the bilateral relationship
had entered the next phase.
In April 2020, Minister of Defense Kono held a
telephone conversation with H.E. the Rt Hon Ben
Wallace, Secretary of State for Defence. The two
ministers exchanged views on issues such as the roles to
be played by the defense authorities and bilateral defense
cooperation and exchanges, taking into consideration
the implications of COVID-19. They also agreed to
vigorously promote bilateral defense cooperation and
exchanges to uphold and reinforce FOIP.
In January 2021, Defense Minister Kishi held a video
teleconference with Secretary of State for Defence
Wallace, where they agreed to cooperate in efforts to
address the risks of infectious diseases that could affect
security. The Japan-UK Foreign and Defence Ministers’
Meeting (“2+2”) was held in February via a video
teleconference for the first time in about three years.

**(1) Significance of Defense Cooperation and**
**Exchanges with China**

A stable relation between Japan and China is an
essential factor for the peace and stability of the IndoPacific region. From broad and medium- to long-term
perspectives, it is necessary for both countries to strive to
build and enhance the “Mutually Beneficial Relationship
Based on Common Strategic Interests with China” in all
areas, including security.
In the security field, in order to enhance mutual
understanding and trust, the MOD/SDF will promote
multilayered dialogues and exchanges with China. In
doing so, Japan conveys its candid concerns about the
situation in the East China Sea, including the waters
around the Senkaku Islands, and continues to encourage
China to play a responsible and constructive role for peace
and stability in the Indo-Pacific region, comply with
international norms of conduct, and improve transparency
regarding defense policy and military capability, so as to
strongly urge China to dispel concerns of the international
community, including Japan. Moreover, in order to avoid
unexpected situations, Japan will utilize the Maritime
and Aerial Communication Mechanism between the
Defense Authorities of Japan and China in a manner that
contributes to building a trusting relationship between the
two countries.

**(2) Recent Major Achievements in Defense Exchanges**

10 years as defense minister.
In December 2020, Minister of Defense Kishi held a
video teleconference with State Councilor and Defense
Minister Wei Fenghe. During the meeting, Minister Kishi
conveyed Japan’s strong concerns about the attempts to
unilaterally change the status quo by coercion in light of

the territory of Japan, and strongly urged China to refrain
from action that could escalate tensions. Regarding the
situation in the South China Sea, Minister Kishi conveyed
Japan’s concerns over the current situation, and pointed
out the importance of the rule of law and self-restraint.
Furthermore, Minister Kishi urged China to dispel

military power. The two ministers confirmed to continue
communications between defense authorities and
concurred to further accelerate coordination toward a
hotline between Japanese and Chinese defense authorities.

Premier Wen Jiabao agreed to develop a mechanism for
communications, particularly maritime communications,
between the two countries’ defense authorities. Based on
the agreement, their defense authorities held the first Joint
Working Group Meeting on the mechanism in April 2008
and accumulated talks. From the fourth Joint Working
Group Meeting in January 2015, diplomatic authorities
of both countries joined the negotiations.
After the eighth meeting of the Japan-China HighLevel Consultation on Maritime Affairs in December 2017
and the seventh Joint Working Group Meeting in April
2018, Japanese and Chinese defense authorities signed
the memorandum on the mechanism[12] in the presence of
then Japanese Prime Minister Abe and Chinese Premier
Li Keqiang on the occasion of the Japan-China summit
meeting in Tokyo in May 2018, and the operation of this
mechanism commenced on June 8, 2018.
The “Maritime and Aerial Communication Mechanism
between the Defense Authorities of Japan and China” has
been developed (1) to promote mutual understanding
and confidence between Japan and China and to enhance
bilateral defense cooperation and exchange; (2) to avoid
unexpected collisions; and (3) to prevent unforeseen
circumstances in the sea and air from developing into
military clashes or political or diplomatic issues. The
mechanism’s main components include (1) annual and
expert meetings between the two countries’ defense
authorities; (2) a hotline between Japanese and Chinese
defense authorities; and (3) on scene communication
measures between vessels and aircraft of the SDF and the
People’s Liberation Army.
Under the mechanism, the first annual and expert
meetings were held between the defense authorities in
December 2018, the second in January 2020.The third
annual and expert meetings were held in March 2021,
Japan conveyed its position on the situation in the East
China Sea, including the sea and airspace around the
Senkaku Islands, expressed strong concerns about any
attempts to unilaterally change the status quo by coercion
and stated its strong opposition to any activities that
escalate tension.
In addition to delivering strong concern about the
China Coast Guard Law, Japan conveyed that it is
absolutely unacceptable that the enactment of the law
would undermine the legitimate interests of the countries
concerned, including Japan, and increase tensions in
waters such as the East China Sea and the South China
Sea. On that basis, Japan shared the recognition that this
mechanism has been operated properly since its inception,
and affirmed the steady progress in coordinating the early


establishment of a hotline between Japanese and Chinese
defense authorities.
At the Japan-China Defense Ministers’ video
teleconference held in December 2020, Japan once again
welcomed the steady progress in coordinating the early
establishment of the hotline, and both Japan and China’s
defense ministers concurred to further accelerate the
coordination for the establishment by exercising both
Ministers’ leadership.

**7 Russia**


**(1) Significance of Defense Cooperation and Exchange**
**with Russia**

Given that Russia is a key security player in the IndoPacific region and an important country neighboring
Japan, it is very important for Japan to promote
confidential relations with Russia through bilateral
defense exchanges. As Japan-Russia relations have
continuously been developing in a wide range of areas,
the MOD/SDF has continuously conducted Japan-Russia
“2+2” Meetings and various dialogues with Russian
defense authorities according to the Memorandum on
Japan-Russia Defense Exchanges signed in 1999 (revised
in 2006), annual meetings based on the Japan-Russia
Agreement on Prevention of Incidents on and over the
High Seas,[13] and bilateral search and rescue exercises.
The Government of Japan deals with the relationships
with Russia appropriately while emphasizing the
solidarity of the G7 (Group of Seven), taking the
Ukrainian situation and other factors into account.
At the same time, it is important to maintain constant
contacts with Russia, as one of Japan’s neighbors, at
the working level to avoid unforeseen circumstances or
unnecessary conflicts. The MOD considers these points
in a comprehensive manner and advances defense
exchanges with Russia accordingly.

**(2) Recent Major Achievements in Defense Exchanges**
At the Japan-Russia summit meeting in April 2013,
the two leaders affirmed the importance of expanding
cooperation between Japan and Russia in the field of
security and defense and agreed to set up the JapanRussia “2+2” Meeting, where the two countries’ defense
and foreign ministers would participate. At the first
Japan-Russia “2+2” Meeting in November 2013, the
two countries agreed to conduct service-to-service
unit exchanges between army branches and the mutual

and Russian Navy in the Gulf of Aden, as well as the
regular Japan-Russia Cybersecurity Meeting.
At the second Japan-Russia “2+2” Meeting in March
2017, the two countries exchanged opinions regarding
the regional situations among other topics. Concerning
the activities of the Russian Armed Forces, the Japanese
side protested against enhancing armaments, including
the deployment of surface-to-ship missiles on the
Northern Territories and the deployment of divisions on
islands that may contain the Four Northern Islands. Japan
expressed regret that these activities conflicted with
Japan’s stance that the Northern Territory is an inherent
part of the territory of Japan.
In July 2018, then Minister of Defense Onodera
became the first Japanese Minister of Defense to pay a
visit to Russia. He joined the Japan-Russia “2+2” Meeting
and the Defense Ministerial Meeting. In these meetings,
Japan and Russia agreed on promoting bilateral defense
exchanges, including a visit by the Chief of Staff, JS to
Russia and mutual visits of naval ships, as well as on
cooperation towards the denuclearization of North Korea,
which has been a shared goal for the two countries.
In May 2019, the Japan-Russia Defense Ministerial
Meeting and the fourth Japan-Russia “2+2” Meeting
were held in Tokyo. Regarding defense exchange, the
Ministers agreed on the first participation by the GSDF
Central Band in an international military music festival
in Russia held in the summer of 2019. Regarding defense
policy, the Japanese side explained that Japan’s missile
defense system is a purely defensive one and does not
pose a threat to Russia.

**(1) Initiatives under the ADMM-Plus**
The ASEAN member states hold the ASEAN Defence
Ministers’ Meeting (ADMM), a ministerial level meeting
among defense authorities in the ASEAN region, and the
ADMM-Plus comprising eight ASEAN member states
including Japan.[16]

The ADMM-Plus is the only meeting hosted by a
government which allows defense ministers in the
Indo- Pacific region, including ASEAN member states
to attend. Thus, the ADMM-Plus is highly significant
from the perspective of promoting the development and
deepening of regional security and defense cooperation.
The MOD/SDF has been actively participating in and
providing support for the meeting. There are (1) the
ASEAN Defence Senior Officials’ Meeting (ADSOM)Plus, (2) ADSOM-Plus Working Group (ADSOMPlus WG), and (3) EWGs under the ministerial level
ADMM-Plus.[17]

In December 2020, Minister of Defense Kishi attended
the 10th Anniversary of the Founding of ADMM-Plus
held online and gave a speech on behalf of the ADMMPlus countries. In his speech, Minister Kishi expressed
that Japan has consistently respected the leading role of
ASEAN and has actively supported ASEAN’s efforts on
non-traditional security issues. He emphasized that Japan
has continued to advocate that regional security issues
should be overcome through reason and dialogue, and
expressed Japan’s resolve to continue contributing to
regional security cooperation.
In addition, Minister of Defense Kishi attended the 7th
ADMM-Plus held online and expressed Japan’s resolve to
make every effort to create a free and open international
order based on the rule of law. Minister Kishi stated that
ASEAN made a concerted effort to enhance the efficacy
of cooperative infectious disease control frameworks,
and expressed Japan’s determination to promote defense
cooperation on infectious disease control. Minister Kishi
expressed his full support for the ASEAN Outlook on
the Indo-Pacific (AOIP), announced by ASEAN in June
2019, which shares many fundamental commonalities


Minister of Defense Kishi giving a speech at the 10th anniversary of the Founding
of the ADMM-Plus (December 2020)

with Japan’s FOIP concept.
On the South China Sea issue, Minister Kishi stated
that Japan strongly opposes unilateral attempts to change
the status-quo by coercion and Japan’s position that the
Code of Conduct in the South China Sea (COC), based
on the rule of law, should not infringe the legitimate
rights and interests of all stakeholders. On issues related
to international security, Minister Kishi highlighted the
imperative of ensuring the full implementation of relevant
UN Security Council resolutions, including through
measures against North Korean ship-to-ship transfers.
In addition, regarding EWGs, which provide
practical cooperation in seven fields,[18] Minister Kishi
stated that Japan, as co-chairs with Vietnam, will
commence activities from April 2021 as part of the
fourth cycle[19] of the ADMM-Plus Experts’ Working
Group on peacekeeping operations, and expressed his
determination to contribute to the region through its cochairing role in this forum.
On this occasion, the Ministers adopted the Joint
Declaration on “Strategic Security Vision of the
ADMM-Plus.”

**the MOD/SDF**

a. ASEAN-Japan Defence Ministers’ Informal Meeting
and Vientiane Vision 2.0
Based on the proposal by Prime Minister Abe at the
ASEAN-Japan Commemorative Summit in December
2013, the first ASEAN-Japan Defence Ministers’ Informal
Meeting took place in Bagan, Myanmar, in November
2014. This meeting, in which opinions were exchanged
on cooperation in non-traditional security areas such
as HA/DR and maritime security, was a breakthrough
opportunity bringing defense ministers from Japan and
the ASEAN member states together for the first time in the
history of nearly 50 years of friendship and cooperation
between Japan and ASEAN. This marked an important
first step towards strengthening defense cooperation in
the future.
In November 2019, at the 5th ASEAN-Japan Defence
Ministers’ Informal Meeting, Defense Minister Kono
announced an updated version of Japan’s original
initiative Vientiane Vision; “Vientiane Vision 2.0.”
The Vientiane Vision presents an overall picture of
the priority areas of the future direction of ASEAN-wide
defense cooperation in a transparent manner. It retains
the basic framework of the initial Vision, including its
objectives, direction, and means of cooperation, but
introduces three new pillars: firstly, establishing three
principles of Japan-ASEAN cooperation which are “heartto-heart cooperation,” “tailored and lasting cooperation”
and “equal and open cooperation;” secondly, introducing
the concept of “resilience” to clarify the connection
between our efforts and ASEAN’s centrality and unity;
and thirdly, pursuing synergies between the AOIP and
Japan’s FOIP.
Furthermore, Minister of Defense Kishi attended
the 6th Japan-ASEAN Defence Minsiters’ Informal
Meeting held online in December 2020, and announced
a new program under “Vientiane Vision 2.0” – the
“Japan-ASEAN Cyber Security Training Program for
Defense Authorities.”[22] ASEAN member state ministers
welcomed the proposal, and expressed their expectation
for the furtherance of practical Japan-ASEAN defense
cooperation in the future.
In the field of HA/DR, since 2018, Japan has held
the Japan-ASEAN Invitation Program on HA/DR.
In February 2020, Japan held the third round of the


invitation program, inviting participants from all ASEAN
member states and the ASEAN Secretariat. In addition
to a seminar on Japan’s response procedures in the event
of a large-scale disaster, table-top exercises and disaster
prevention drill inspections were held.
In the field of international law, in November 2018,
Japan invited all ASEAN member states and the
ASEAN Secretariat to the Japan-ASEAN Symposium
on International Law titled “Regional Cooperation in the
Indo-Pacific and the Rule of Law.”
In the field of international aviation law and security in
the air of aviation, the Professional Airmanship Program
was held for the first time in July 2019, inviting all ASEAN
member states and the ASEAN Secretariat. During the
program, the participants attended a symposium and
base visits to promote confidence building among the
air components of Japan and ASEAN member states,
contribute to ensuring the rule of law in the Indo-Pacific
region, and bring better impact on the regional stability.
In addition, in June 2019, the Japan-ASEAN Ship
Rider Cooperation Program was conducted on board
the Destroyer JS “Izumo,” during the Indo-Pacific
Deployment, with 10 participants from all ASEAN
member states and the Secretariat. In the program,
participants experienced a five-day voyage from Muara in
Brunei to Subic in the Philippines, during which seminars
on international maritime law and HA/DR at sea and a
table top exercise on HA/DR at Sea were also conducted
to improve their knowledge of maritime security.
Through these initiatives, Japan has worked to promote
capacity building, mutual understanding, and network
building with participants from all ASEAN member
states through seminars and training programs in various
areas, including maritime security and HA/DR, while
also fostering a shared recognition about international
law, which has contributed to the stability of the IndoPacific region.

See Reference 45 (Vientiane Vision 2.0)

b. Japan-ASEAN Defense Vice-Ministerial Forum
Since 2009, the MOD has annually held the JapanASEAN Defense Vice-Ministerial Forum for the purpose
of strengthening bilateral and multilateral relationships
through the development of human networks between
Japanese and ASEAN vice-ministerial level officials.
The forum was canceled in 2020 due to the COVID-19
pandemic.
c. Tokyo Defense Forum, etc.
The MOD has held the Asia-Pacific Defense Forum
(Tokyo Defense Forum) since 1996 for senior officials
in charge of defense policy (Director-General level
officials and general-level officers) from the countries in


**Chapter**

the region to discuss defense policies of the participating
countries and confidence-building measures in the field
of defense.
The forum was canceled in 2020 and 2021 due to the
COVID-19 pandemic.

**(4) Others**
a. International Conferences Hosted by Private
Organizations
International conferences on security include not only
intergovernmental conferences but also meetings
organized by private organizations in which various
people, such as government officials, scholars, and
journalists, participate to discuss medium- to long- term
security issues.
Major international conferences organized by private
bodies include the IISS Asia Security Summit (ShangriLa Dialogue),[23] IISS Regional Security Summit (Manama
Dialogue),[24] organized by the International Institute
for Strategic Studies (IISS), and the Munich Security
Conference,[25] one of the most prestigious meetings
on security in Europe and the United States. Defense
Minister and MOD officials actively participate in these
meetings, holding talks with defense ministers and other
representatives from other countries, while making
speeches at these meetings, in order to build trust and
share mutual recognition with high-level officials and to
send out positive messages.
In November 2019, Defense Minister Kono attended
the 15th Manama Dialogue. This was the first time for
a Japanese Defense Minister to participate in the event.
At the meeting, he delivered a speech and held bilateral
talks with the French Minister of the Armed Forces and
ministerial-level officials from Jordan, Bahrain, and
Yemen. In his speech, Minister Kono stated that Japan
has continuously contributed to peace and stability in the
Middle East based on an understanding that an open and
secure maritime order provides the basis for a stable and
prosperous international community, and that the SDF
is forging broader and closer ties with this Middle East
through human contributions to maritime security in the
region, participation in exercises, defense equipment
cooperation, person-to-person links, and other initiatives.
He also stated that Japan attaches importance to the
freedom of navigation and the rule of law at sea, and
that, in order to ensure the safety of Japan-related ships


and to secure the peace and stability of the Middle East
region, Japan has explained how it can best utilize the
assets of the SDF as its independent efforts to reinforce
information gathering.
In December 2019, Defense Minister Kono also
attended the 19th Doha Forum organized by the
Government of Qatar for the first time as a defense
minister. He held bilateral meetings with the Ministers of
Defense of Qatar and Malaysia and the Chairman of the
Joint Chiefs of Staff of Jordan, while also delivering a
speech at the main meeting. In his speech on multilateral
security cooperation, Defense Minister Kono expressed
concern over the strengthening of North Korea’s military
capabilities, including its nuclear and missile capabilities.
He also stated that it is necessary to reinforce arms control
and disarmament and the rule of law in the international
community, and that Japan is working with other countries
to promote FOIP through bilateral/multilateral exercises,
capacity building, and defense equipment and technology
cooperation based on the rule of law. He cited Vientiane
Vision 2.0 as an example of Japan’s multilateral security
cooperation efforts, and said that Japan would continue to
promote multilateral security cooperation.
Minister of Defense Kono and Minister of Foreign
Affairs Motegi attended the 56th Munich Security
Conference in February 2020. On the occasion of
the conference, Minister of Defense Kono held the
first defense ministerial meeting with H.E. Andriy
Zahorodnyuk, Ukrainian Minister of Defence, as well as
bilateral and other meetings with the defense ministers
of Canada, France, and Germany, as well as with the
High Representative of the EU and the Secretary General
of NATO, where they exchanged views on defense
cooperation and exchanges and regional situations.
b. Service-to-Service Exchange Initiatives
In August 2020, the Chief of Staff, JS participated in
the online Indo-Pacific Chiefs of Defense Conference
(CHOD) co-hosted by the U.S. INDOPACOM and
Republic of Fiji Military Forces. The conference
promoted mutual understanding of Japan’s and other
countries’ defense policies and views on the situation.
In November, the Chief of Staff, JS participated online in
the Indo-Pacific Joint Heads of Pacific Security Conference
(JHoPS) co-hosted by the Australian Defence Forces,
federal police and border forces. Senior military and police
delegates from about 25 countries and regions from primarily

Pacific Island countries discussed the COVID-19 pandemic
and disaster response. Through this conference, the Chief
of Staff noted Japan’s promotion of a mutual understanding
on maritime security and disaster response in Japan and
other countries, and spoke about how regional cooperation
is important even during the COVID-19 pandemic, and that
Japan will actively cooperate.
In May, the Chief of Staff, GSDF participated in the IndoPacific Landpower Conference, a video teleconference
hosted by the commander of the U.S. Army Pacific.
Senior army members from 23 countries in northeast and
southeast Asia and Oceania participated in the conference.
Participants agreed to continued cooperation as countries
that share common values in order to realize FOIP, and
affirmed the necessity to share lessons learned in their
responses to the COVID-19 pandemic.
In September and December, the Chief of Staff, MSDF
participated in a multilateral video teleconference hosted
by the Commander of the U.S. Pacific Fleet. Navy Chiefs
of Staff from more than a dozen countries in the IndoPacific region participated in the conference, and shared
the view to continue defense cooperation and exchanges
with each other by leveraging the advantage of the


**(1) Pacific Partnership**
The Pacific Partnership (PP), which started in 2007, is
an initiative in which naval vessels, primarily those
from the U.S. Navy, visit countries in the Asia-Pacific
region to provide medical care, conduct facility repair
activities, and engage in cultural exchange to strengthen
cooperation between countries participating in the
initiative and facilitate international peace cooperation
activities through cooperation with governments,
military forces, international organizations, and nongovernmental organizations (NGOs) in those countries.
Japan has dispatched SDF medical personnel and units
under the Pacific Partnership since 2007.

**(2) Multilateral Exercises**
a. Significance of Multilateral Exercises in the IndoPacific Region
In the Indo-Pacific region, the MOD/SDF has actively
participated in multilateral training and exercises in
non-traditional security fields such as HA/DR and Non

Exercise “RIMPAC 2020” hosted by the U.S. Navy (August 2020)

combatant Evacuation Operations (NEO), in addition to
traditional training conducted in preparation for combat
situations. It is important to participate in such multilateral
exercises so as not only to raise the skill level of the SDF,
but also to create a cooperative platform with relevant
countries. In light of this perspective, the MOD/SDF
intends to continue to actively engage in such training.
b. Initiatives for Multilateral Exercises
The multilateral relationships have recently shifted from
the phrase for building trust to the phrase for developing
more concrete and practical cooperative relationships.
Various multilateral training and exercises have been
actively conducted as important initiatives to effectively
help this shifting.
The SDF have been participating in the Multilateral
Exercise “Cobra Gold” cohosted by the United States and
Thailand since 2005. During “Cobra Gold 20,” in which
the SDF took part in 2020, the SDF conducted training
related to the rescue of Japanese nationals overseas to

In August 2020, the MSDF participated in the
Multilateral Exercise “RIMPAC 2020” hosted by the
U.S. Navy in the sea and airspace around the Hawaiian
Islands. In January 2021, the MSDF participated in the
U.S.-hosted Multilateral Anti-Submarine Exercise “Sea
Dragon 2021” in the surrounding sea areas and airspace
of Guam, and in February, took part in the Pakistan
Navy-hosted Multilateral Exercise “AMAN 21” in the
surrounding sea areas and airspace of the northern Arabian
Sea. In April, the MSDF participated in the Multilateral
Maritime Exercise “La Perouse 21” with France, the
U.S., Australia and India, in the Bay of Bengal.
From January to February, the ASDF participated
in the Multilateral Exercises “Cope North 21” with the
United States and Australia.

the second method, the recipient country’s officials are
invited to the MOD/SDF’s units to improve the skills
of trainees and to share knowledge of human resources
development that the MOD/SDF provides through
seminars, lectures, and training programs.
In addition, online lectures and practical training have
been introduced as a new means of capacity building
from 2021, in light of the COVID-19 pandemic.
The number of personnel dispatched for capacity
building programs conducted from January 2020 to
March 2021 was 33 (four countries, seven projects),
and the number of those invited was 57 (three countries,
one organization and four projects). In addition, online
lectures and practical training were conducted for a total
of 11 people (two counties, two programs).
Specifically, some of the dispatches for capacity building
projects conducted by the SDF included education and
guidance on vehicle maintenance management in TimorLeste, cybersecurity seminars and air rescue seminars in
Vietnam, which aimed at improving the country’s incident
response capabilities, and air rescue seminars for the Sri
Lanka Air Force. In addition, for Myanmar, the SDF
conducted practical training and underwater medical
seminars to establish the Air Force’s meteorological unit,
and also invited a Myanmar medical officer for training
on the submarine rescue ship “Chiyoda,” in which they
actively exchanged views on the field of underwater

**1 General Situation**


In today’s security environment, no country can maintain
its peace and stability on its own. It is indispensable for the
international community to unite to resolve global issues.
The defense authorities of Southeast Asian and other
countries have either requested the MOD to undertake
capacity building, or expressed their expectations for
such cooperation. In response to such expectations, the
MOD/SDF started to provide capacity building in the
security and defense areas in 2012.
Capacity building has the following objectives:
(1) creating a desirable security environment for Japan
by supporting partner countries in the Indo-Pacific
region to develop their own capacity in a sustainable
manner, and enabling the recipient countries’ forces to
undertake adequate roles in maintaining international
peace and regional stability; (2) strengthening bilateral
relationships with partner countries; (3) strengthening
relationships with other donor countries, such as the
United States and Australia; and (4) promoting Japan’s
proactive and independent efforts to realizing regional
peace and stability, and to gain trust in the MOD/SDF as
well as the whole of Japan.
The MOD/SDF will implement capacity building
programs effectively by carefully coordinating with
diplomatic policies and combining various means to
maximize effects, while also tapping into the knowledge
accumulated by the SDF to date.

**2 Specific Activities**


**Chapter**


The MOD/SDF has provided capacity building in such
areas as HA/DR, PKO, and maritime security to 15
countries and one organization in the Indo-Pacific region.
The MOD/SDF’s capacity building programs
are aimed at improving the capabilities of recipient
countries in a concrete and steady manner over a certain
period of time.
Some programs are carried out by dispatching MOD/
SDF officials to the recipient country, by inviting the
recipient country’s officials to Japan, or by a combination
of both. With the first method, SDF officials with technical
knowledge are dispatched to the recipient country to
help said country’s forces and their related organizations

contributes to UN PKO. The SDF also provided online
engineering equipment education to engineering units
that contribute to HA/DR in Papua New Guinea, which
is a new field of support following the SDF’s support for
developing military bands since 2015.
In addition, as part of capacity building for Africa,
the MOD/SDF implemented a program for supporting


the enhancement of disaster response capacity for the
Djibouti Armed Forces, including training on how
to operate engineering equipment, such as hydraulic
shovels, graders, and dozers, in order to strengthen the
bilateral relationship since 2016.

See Fig. III-3-1-5 (Recent Capacity Building Initiatives [from

January 2020 to March 2021])

**3 Collaboration with Related Countries**


In efforts to stabilize the regional security environment,
collaboration with other donor countries is essential.
In particular, collaboration with the United States, and
Australia is considered a priority.
Firstly between Japan and the U S the joint statement


-----

of the Japan-U.S. “2+2” in April 2015 states that the
two countries would strengthen their continued close
coordination on cooperation including capacity building
to realize peace, stability, and prosperity in the region.
The two ministers agreed to promote defense cooperation
with Southeast Asian countries.
Between Japan and Australia, under a Japan-Australia
personnel exchange program, the MOD has received five
officials from the Australian Department of Defense five
times since 2013. In exchange, the MOD has dispatched
four officials to the Australian Department of Defense
four times since 2015.
In November 2017, Japan and Australia held the first


working group on capacity building.
Japan has also cooperated with the United States and
Australia in providing capacity building to Timor-Leste.
The SDF and the U.S. forces participated in the Harii
Hamutuk Exercise sponsored by the Australian forces
in Timor-Leste five times since October 2015, providing
technical guidance on engineering for engineering units
of the Timor-Leste forces.
It is important for Japan and other countries providing
capacity building to conduct such cooperation effectively
and efficiently by closely coordinating with and mutually
complementing each other.

Council resolutions[1] were adopted, such as UN Security
Council Resolution 1816, which was adopted in June
2008 in response to the frequent occurrence of and rapid
increase in piracy incidents with the purpose of acquiring
ransoms by detaining hostages caused by pirates, who are
armed with machine guns and rocket launchers. These
resolutions have requested that various countries take
actions, particularly the dispatch of warships and military
aircraft, to deter piracy in the waters off the coast of
Somalia and in the Gulf of Aden.
To date, approximately 30 countries, including the
United States, have dispatched their warships to the
waters off the coast of Somalia and in the Gulf of Aden.
As part of its counterpiracy initiatives, the EU has been
conducting Operation Atalanta since December 2008,
in addition to the counter-piracy operations conducted
by the Combined Task Force 151 (CTF 151)[2] that was
established in January 2009. Meanwhile, other countries
have been dispatching their assets to the area.
As these initiatives by the international community
have proved to be effective, the number of acts of piracy
occurring in the waters off the coast of Somalia and in
the Gulf of Aden has currently hovered at a low level.

Piracy Incidents Off the Coast of Somalia
Fig. III-3-2-1
and in the Gulf of Aden


However, the assumed root causes of piracy such as
terrorism and poverty in Somalia have still remained
unsolved. In addition, considering the fact that Somalia’s
capability to crack down on piracy is also still insufficient,
if the international community reduces its counter-piracy
efforts, the situation could be easily reversed. Therefore,
there is no great change in the situation in which Japan
must carry out its counter-piracy operations.

**2 Japanese Initiatives**


**(1) Legislation Concerning Counter-Piracy Operations**
In March 2009, following the order for Maritime Security
Operations for the purpose of protecting Japan-affiliated
vessels from acts of piracy in the waters off the coast
of Somalia and in the Gulf of Aden, two destroyers[3]
began providing direct escort to Japan-affiliated vessels,
while P-3C patrol aircraft also commenced warning and
surveillance operations in June of the same year.
Japan subsequently enacted the Anti-Piracy Measures
Act[4] in July of the same year. This act made it possible
to protect the vessels of all nations from acts of piracy,
regardless of their flag states. Moreover, it also enabled

Other UN Security Council resolutions calling for cooperation in deterring piracy are: Resolutions 1838, 1846, and 1851 (adopted in 2008), Resolution 1897 (adopted in 2009), Resolutions
1918 and 1950 (adopted in 2010), Resolutions 1976 and 2020 (adopted in 2011), Resolution 2077 (adopted in 2012), Resolution 2125 (adopted in 2013), Resolution 2184 (adopted in

Resolution 2554 (adopted in 2020).

The Combined Maritime Forces (CMF), the headquarters of which is located in Bahrain, announced the establishment of the CTF in January 2009 as a multilateral combined task force for counterpiracy operations.

means were available, in order to halt vessels engaging in
acts of piracy, such as approaching civilian vessels.
Furthermore, the Act on Special Measures concerning
the Security of Japanese Flagged Vessels in Areas that
Are Highly Susceptible to Acts of Piracy came into force
on November 2013, which made it possible to have
security guards on board a Japanese ship provided certain
requirements are met, enabling them to carry small arms
for the purpose of security operations.

**(2) Activities by the SDF**
a. Dispatch of the Deployment Surface Force for Counter
Piracy Enforcement (DSPE) and Other Units
The SDF dispatches the DSPE, the Deployment Air Force for
Counter Piracy Enforcement (DAPE), and the Deployment
Support Group for Counter Piracy Enforcement (DGPE) to
carry out counter-piracy operations.
The DSPE strives to ensure the safety of ships
navigating in the area in two different manners – direct
escort of private vessels across the Gulf of Aden, and
zone defense in allocated areas in the Gulf of Aden, by
using destroyers (one destroyer dispatched). There are
JCG officers aboard the destroyer.[5]

The DAPE conducts counter-piracy activities using the
P-3C patrol aircraft (two aircraft dispatched). The unit
conducts warning and surveillance operations in the flight
zone that is determined in coordination with the CTF 151
Headquarters and confirms any suspicious boats. At the
same time, the unit also provides information to the MSDF
destroyers, the naval vessels of other countries and civilian
vessels, responding by such means as confirming the
safety of the surrounding area immediately, if requested.
The information gathered by MSDF P-3Cs is constantly
shared with other related organizations, and contributes
significantly to deterring acts of piracy and disarming
vessels suspected as pirate ships.
In order to improve the operational efficiency and
effectiveness of the DAPE, the DGPE carries out
activities such as maintenance of the installation set up
in the northwest district of Djibouti International Airport.
Additionally, the Airlift Squadron operates ASDF
transport aircraft to carry out air transport of materials
required by the DAPE and the DGPE, and airlifts, etc.,
are organized as needed.
In November 2020, in order to stably implement a
self-sufficient response by the SDF in the event of an


CTF 151 commander and headquarters staff engaged in counter-piracy operations
with other countries’ military personnel in Bahrain (June 2020)

overseas P-3C patrol aircraft failure, in addition to
increasing the number of airlift personnel, etc., to about
130, the number of personnel dispatched to counterpiracy operations support teams was increased to about
120 due to the renovations at the SDF installation in the
Republic of Djibouti.
b. CTF 151 Deployed Unit at the Headquarters
In order to strengthen coordination with the units of
other countries engaged in counter-piracy operations and
enhance the effectiveness of the SDF’s counter-piracy
operations, the MOD has dispatched SDF personnel to
the CTF 151 Headquarters since August 2014. During
the period from May to August 2015, the SDF also
dispatched a CTF 151 commander for the first time, while
between March and June 2017, March and June 2018,
and February and June 2020, a CTF 151 commander as
well as staff were also dispatched to the Headquarters.
c. Achievements
As of March 31, 2021, the DSPE has escorted 4,049
vessels. Under the protection of the SDF destroyers, not a
single vessel has come to any harm from pirates and these
vessels have all passed safely across the Gulf of Aden.
As of May 31, 2021, the DAPE has conducted the
following activities: aircraft have flown 2,707 missions
with their flying hours totaling 19,930 hours; and
information was provided to vessels navigating the area
and other countries engaging in counter-piracy operations
on around 15,266 occasions. The activities conducted by
the DAPE account for approximately 70 to 80% of the
warning and surveillance operations carried out in the
Gulf of Aden by the international community.

Meanwhile, the SDF is enhancing informationgathering abilities and protection abilities, which are
required for the SDF units to carry out their missions while
ensuring the safety of personnel and units in international
peace cooperation activities, etc. In addition, in order to
respond to various environments and prolonged missions,
the SDF is improving its capabilities for transport,
deployment, and information communication, as well as
developing a structure of logistic and medical support for
conducting smooth and continuous operations.
With regard to the education necessary for engaging
in international peace cooperation activities, the GSDF
International Peace Cooperation Activities Training
Unit, which belongs to the Ground Component
Command, provides training for GSDF personnel to be
deployed to international peace cooperation activities,
as well as supports their training. In addition, the Japan
Peacekeeping Training and Research Center (JPC) of
the Joint Staff College offers not only basic education
courses on international peace cooperation activities,
but also specialized education to train personnel who
can be appointed as contingent commanders of UN PKO
missions and staff officers of mission headquarters. These
specialized courses are conducted by using UN standard
training materials and foreign instructors.
Furthermore, since FY2014, the JPC has also provided
education for personnel from foreign militaries and
other Japanese ministries and agencies. This initiative

their missions in recent years to include such duties
as the Protection of Civilians (POC), the promotion of
political processes, providing assistance in Disarmament,
Demobilization and Reintegration (DDR) into society of
former soldiers, Security Sector Reform (SSR), the rule of
law, elections, human rights, and other fields, in addition
to such traditional missions as ceasefire monitoring. To
date, there are 12 UN PKO missions ongoing (as of the
end of March 2021).

represents the approach taken by the MOD/SDF, which
emphasizes the necessity of collaboration and cooperation
with other related ministries and foreign countries, based
on the current situation of more multi-dimensional and
complicated international peace cooperation activities.
The initiative aims to contribute to more effective
international peace cooperation activities by enhancing
collaboration in the field of education.

**3 Welfare and Mental Health Measures for**
**Dispatched SDF Units**


The MOD/SDF is implementing various family support
and mental health support measures for dispatched SDF
personnel and their families to alleviate any anxieties
they may go through during the dispatch. For example,
depending on the characteristics of the duties of the unit to
be dispatched, the MOD/SDF provides SDF personnel with
necessary measures such as the following: (1) education
before the dispatch on necessary knowledge on how to
reduce stress; (2) mental health check before, during, and
after the dispatch; (3) counseling on anxieties and concerns
during the dispatch, conducted by staffs specially trained
for carrying out mental health care; (4) dispatch of a
mental health care team including a medical officer with
expertise on mental health care; (5) stress reduction
education upon returning to Japan; and (6) medical
checkup after returning to Japan.

Effective Use of Human Resources), p. 419

cooperation activities in various regions, including
Cambodia, the Golan Heights, Timor-Leste, Nepal, and
South Sudan for more than 25 years, and the results of
these activities have been highly praised both inside and
outside of Japan.
In addition to continuous dispatch of staff officers to
UNMISS, Japan is able to participate in Internationally
Coordinated Operations for Peace and Security along with
enforcement of the Legislation for Peace and Security. In
April 2019, Japan started to dispatch staff officers to the
Multinational Force and Observers (MFO).
Japan will actively contribute to international
peace cooperation activities through such activities
as dispatch of personnel to mission headquarters and
capacity building in Japan’s fields of expertise by using
accumulated experience so far and working on human
resource development.

**(2) Activities by Dispatched Engineering Units**
Since the commencement of its engineering activities
within UN facilities in Juba in March 2012, the
dispatched engineering unit has steadily expanded its
activities. The SDF has continued to dispatch over 300
personnel after the second unit took over, and carried out
activities with great significance, such as repairing roads
and constructing facilities for displaced people while
ensuring the safety of the personnel.
Japan could move on to a new phase regarding
engineering activities in Juba that the SDF was in
charge of. Considering the above-mentioned issues in a
comprehensive manner, in March 2017, the Government
of Japan came to the conclusion that the SDF engineering
unit would withdraw from Juba around the end of May
2017. SDF personnel engaged in withdrawal work, then
sequentially withdrew from South Sudan, and terminated
the operations by the engineering unit in UNMISS. At the
conclusion of their activities, the dispatched engineering
units repaired a total of approximately 260 km of roads
and developed a total of approximately 500 000 m[2] etc


**(1) Significance of the Dispatch of Personnel to UNMISS**
In July 2011 following South Sudan’s independence,
with the objective of consolidating peace and security
as well as helping establish necessary conditions for
the development of South Sudan, the UNMISS was
established. Japan was requested by the UN to cooperate
with UNMISS, particularly through the dispatch of GSDF
engineering units. The Cabinet approved the dispatch
of two staff officers (logistics and database officers) to
UNMISS in November 2011, and in December it decided
to dispatch an SDF engineering unit, Coordination Center,
and an additional staff officer (engineering officer). In
addition, the Cabinet also approved the dispatch of one
staff officer (air operations officer) in October 2014.

**3 Dispatch of MOD Personnel to the UN**
**Secretariat**


The UNTPP was founded using funds from Japan
as a project to support training for military engineers
and the procurement of heavy equipment by the UN
DOS. Japan has been dispatching SDF personnel to the
International Peace Support Training Centre (IPSTC)
in Nairobi, Kenya, as trainers since the pilot training
in September 2015. At the IPSTC, the SDF personnel
efficiently provided training on engineering equipment
for trainees from forces of African countries from June
to October 2018 according to their level of engineering
equipment skills.
Two training sessions on the operation and
maintenance of heavy equipment were provided for the
Ugandan Army’s engineers from August to November
2019. This was the first training session held at the
Uganda Rapid Deployment Capability Centre. From the
start of the project to March 2021, a total of 164 GSDF
officers have been dispatched to Africa to provide nine
training sessions for a total of 277 members from eight
African countries.
Considering that 30% or more of PKO personnel are
from Asia, Japan decided to implement the project for the
first time in Asia and the surrounding regions. The project
provides training on heavy engineering piloting for
engineering personnel. Since a 2018 trial training, GSDF
personnel have been dispatched as trainers to Vietnamese
military garrisons in Hanoi, and from October to
December 2019 they conducted engineering equipment
training for the Vietnamese engineering personnel at the
garrisons. In addition, from February to March 2020,
Training-of-Trainers (ToT) for engineering equipment
was conducted for military personnel from several Asian
countries. From the start of the project until March 2021,
a total of 66 SDF personnel were dispatched to Vietnam
and 56 personnel from in and around Asia were trained
for a total of three times.
In addition, the UN decided to extend the scope of
support under this project to the field of sanitation,
given that strengthening sanitation capacity to ensure
the safety of deployed personnel has become an issue in
UN peacekeeping operations. In response, the UN Field
Medical Assistant Course (UNFMAC), which aims to
train personnel who can provide first aid before medics or
medical personnel provide specialized treatment in areas
of PKO operations, was implemented in October 2019.
In the course, eight instructors, including two GSDF
officers, trained 29 personnel at the UN Regional Service
Centre Entebbe in Uganda.


The MOD/SDF dispatches personnel to the UN Secretariat
for the purpose of actively contributing to the UN efforts
to achieve international peace and for the purpose of
utilizing experiences of dispatched personnel in Japan’s
PKO activity. As of March 2021, one of the SDF personnel
(action officer level) is involved in the formulation of
UN PKO policies and plans at the UN Department of
Peace Operations (DPO), and one SDF personnel and
one administrative official (both action officer level) are
working on the United Nations Triangular Partnership
Project (UNTPP)[3] at the UN Department of Operational
Support (DOS).
In addition, since December 2002, including personnel
currently dispatched, Japan has sent seven SDF personnel
(one director level, six action officer level) to the UN
DPO and four SDF personnel and administrative officials
(all action officer level) to the UN DOS.

Japan has so far earned unquestionable trust in the areas of
engineering and transport that are essential for promoting
smooth peacekeeping operations. To continue to support
the rapid deployment of peacekeeping missions and
implement high quality activities, Japan expressed its
active support at the PKO Summit in September 2014,
and it was embodied by the UNTPP.

To this end, the SDF maintains its readiness to take
any necessary actions based on prepared disaster relief
operation plans. In consultation with the Minister
of Foreign Affairs, the SDF has been proactively
conducting international disaster relief activities,
which fully utilize its functions and capabilities, while
taking into consideration specific relief requests by the
governments of affected countries and disaster situations
in these countries.

Responding to specific relief requests by the governments
of affected countries and the scale of disaster situations
in these countries, the SDF’s capabilities in international
disaster relief activities encompass (1) medical services,
such as first-aid medical treatment and epidemic
prevention; (2) transport of relief items, patients and
personnel by helicopter and other means; and (3) water
supply activities using water-purifying devices. In
addition, the SDF uses transport aircraft and ships to
carry disaster relief personnel and equipment to the
affected area.
The Ground Component Command regional units of
the GSDF and other relevant GSDF units maintain their
readiness to ensure that they can carry out international
disaster relief activities in an independent manner anytime
when needed. The Self Defense Fleet of the MSDF and
Air Support Command of the ASDF also constantly
maintain their readiness to transport personnel and their
supplies to disaster affected areas. Furthermore, in April
2015, the MOD/SDF also improved its readiness to be
able to swiftly respond to a request for search activities
using MSDF fixed-wing patrol aircraft.


**Chapter**


Since the enactment of the Law Concerning the Dispatch
of the Japan Disaster Relief Team (Japan Disaster Relief
Team Law) in 1987, Japan has engaged in international
disaster relief activities in response to requests from
the governments of affected countries and international
organizations. In 1992, the Japan Disaster Relief Team
Law was partially amended, enabling the SDF to
participate in international disaster relief activities and to
transport its personnel and equipment for this purpose.

After employment, uniformed SDF personnel are
assigned their branch of service and duties at units all
around Japan, in accordance with their choice or aptitude,
following basic education and training at respective
training units or schools of respective SDF services.

**(1) Uniformed SDF Personnel**
Based on a voluntary system that respects individuals’
free will, uniformed SDF personnel are recruited under
various categories. The upper age limit of general
candidate for enlistment (Upper) and candidates for
uniformed SDF personnel was raised from “under 27”
to “under 33” in 2018 in order to secure diverse human
resources from a broader range, including people with
work experience in private companies.
Moreover, a review of the examination for candidates
for uniformed SDF personnel was conducted in 2020
in order to ensure improvement of the quality of the
uniformed SDF personnel in fixed-term system (candidate
for uniformed SDF personnel) while securing human
resources with diverse backgrounds and capabilities.

Notes: 1. Staff candidates for the medicine, dentistry, and pharmacy faculties will be promoted to the position of First Lieutenant if they pass the national examinations in medicine and complete the prescribed

education and training.

2. General candidate for enlistment (upper) refers to a candidate who has been enlisted with the premise that he/she will be promoted to a fixed-term position of “Enlisted (upper).” Until FY2006, there

were two programs consisting of “Student candidates for enlistment (upper)” and “Enlisted (upper) candidates.” However, these two programs were reorganized and combined, and since FY2007,
candidates have been appointed as “General candidates for enlistment (upper).”

3. As for the candidate for uniformed SDF personnel, in order to enhance the initial education of SDF personnel in fixed-term service, in July 2010, it was decided that their status during the first three
months of their enlistment would be as non-SDF personnel, and they would engage exclusively in fundamental education and training as non-regular Ministry of Defense personnel.

4. GSDF High Technical School trains people to be SDF personnel who will be capable not only of operating and making full use of equipment in the GSDF but also of conducting missions in the

international community. Starting from FY2010 appointments, the status of the school’s students was changed from SDF officer to “students,” which is a new non-regular status. New students receive
a high school diploma at the conclusion of a student course (three years) through distance learning. From the FY2011 appointments, a new recommendation system was introduced in which those
who are considered appropriate to be a GSDF High Technical School student are selected from among the candidates based on the recommendation of the principal of their junior high school etc., in
addition to the conventional general examination.

5. A three-year program ended in FY2013. A new four-year program was established at the Division of Nursing, National Defense Medical College, in FY2014.
6. For Aviation Cadets, the Maritime Self-Defense Force selects from persons 18 or above and under 23 in age and the Air Defense Force 18 or above and under 21 in age.
7. For students on loans, the SDF lends school expenses (54,000 yen per month) to students who major in medicine, dentistry, or science and engineering at a university or a graduate school (excluding professional
graduate schools) and have an intention to continue serving as SDF personnel after graduation (completion) by taking advantage of academic knowledge in their specialized fields.

**(2) SDF Reserve Personnel, SDF Ready Reserve**
**Personnel, and Candidates for SDF Reserve Personnel**

It is essential to secure the required number of uniformed
SDF personnel promptly depending on situational
changes in the event of a crisis. To secure the required
number promptly and systematically, the MOD maintains
the following three systems: the SDF Reserve Personnel
system, the SDF Ready Reserve Personnel system, and
the Candidates for SDF Reserve Personnel system.[2]

See Fig. IV-1-1-3 (Overview of Systems Related to SDF Reserve

See

Personnel)

SDF Reserve Personnel become uniformed SDF
personnel upon the issuance of a defense call-up order
or other orders, and carry out logistical support and base
guard duties. SDF Ready Reserve Personnel become
uniformed SDF personnel and are assigned to carry out
their mission together with incumbent uniformed SDF
personnel as part of frontline units following the issuance
of a defense call-up order or other orders. Candidates
for SDF Reserve Personnel, some of whom are recruited
among those with no prior experience as uniformed SDF
personnel, are appointed as SDF Reserve Personnel after
completing the necessary education and training.
As SDF Reserve Personnel and others work in
their civilian jobs under normal circumstances, they
need to adjust their work schedule to participate in
periodic training exercises. Therefore, understanding
and cooperation from the companies that employ these
personnel are essential.
For this purpose, the MOD provides a special subsidy to
the companies that employ SDF Ready Reserve Personnel
and take necessary measures to allow such employees to
attend training sessions for 30 days a year, by taking into
consideration the burden on such companies.
Also, in 2017, the MOD established a framework that
allows the MOD/SDF to provide such information as
the scheduled term of a training call-up and scheduled
term during which SDF Reserve Personnel/SDF
Ready Reserve Personnel are called up to perform


actual operations and are appointed as uniformed SDF
personnel, when requested by their employers. In 2018,
the MOD established a system to provide a subsidy
which aims to contribute to securing understanding and
cooperation from the employers regarding the duties of
SDF Reserve Personnel. Under the system, the employers
are provided with a subsidy if (1) SDF Reserve Personnel
or SDF Ready Reserve Personnel respond to a defense
operation call-up order, civil protection dispatch call-up
order, or disaster relief call-up order, etc., or (2) if they
have no choice but to leave their regular occupations due
to injuries during their duties, etc.
In addition, a special subsidy to the companies that
cooperate with training of SDF Ready Reserve Personnel
was established in 2020. The subsidy is paid to companies
that employ people who, after being a Candidate for SDF
Reserve Personnel with no prior experience as uniformed
SDF personnel, are appointed as SDF Ready Reserve
Personnel after completing the necessary education and
training, and that take necessary measures to allow such
employees to attend training sessions.
SDF Ready Reserve Personnel were called up at
the time of the 2018 July Heavy Rain[3] and the 2018
Hokkaido Eastern Iburi Earthquake.[4] In 2019, during
the East Japan Typhoon (Typhoon Hagibis)[5] and the
2020 July Heavy Rain,[6] both SDF Ready Reserve
Personnel and SDF Reserve Personnel were called
up. In those cases, they carried out activities including
transportation of goods and livelihood support to the
affected people. Moreover, in 2020, in a disaster relief
mission to prevent infection of the novel coronavirus
disease (COVID19) from spreading, SDF Reserve
Personnel with medical qualification were called up and
carried out their missions, including medical support.[7]

The MOD has been implementing various measures to
increase and enhance SDF Reserve Personnel and others
because SDF Reserve Personnel are anticipated to be
called up more often in response to earthquake and other
disasters. Specifically, recruitment and appointment were

Many other countries also have reserve personnel systems.

In response to the 2018 July Heavy Rain, approximately 310 SDF Ready Reserve Personnel were called up. From July 12 to 30, they engaged in activities including removal of disaster waste and
livelihood support to the affected people.

In response to the 2018 Hokkaido Eastern Iburi Earthquake, approximately 250 SDF Ready Reserve Personnel were called up. From September 8 to 23, they engaged in activities including livelihood
support to the affected people.

In response to the 2019 East Japan Typhoon (Typhoon Hagibis), approximately 410 SDF Ready Reserve Personnel and SDF Reserve Personnel were called up. From October 15 to November 8, they
engaged in activities including removal of disaster waste and livelihood support to the affected people.

In response to the 2020 July Heavy Rain, approximately 350 SDF Ready Reserve Personnel and SDF Reserve Personnel qualified as nurses were called up. From July 7 to 19, they engaged in activities
including removal of disaster waste and medical support.

In a disaster relief mission against COVID-19 in 2020, 10 SDF Reserve Personnel with a medical qualification were called up and engaged in activities including medical support from February 18 to

established to appoint SDF Reserve Personnel without
experience in the SDF as SDF Ready Reserve Personnel
after completing the necessary education and training.
Also, the MOD promotes the use of SDF Reserve
Personnel in a wide range of fields, such as the
appointment of retired SDF pilots, who were reemployed
in the private sector through the re-employment system,
as SDF Reserve Personnel.[8]

**(3) Administrative Officials, Technical and Engineering**
**Officials, Instructors, and Other Civilian Personnel**

There are approximately 21,000 civilian personnel
— administrative officials, technical and engineering
officials, instructors, and others — in addition to
uniformed SDF personnel in the MOD/SDF.[9] Civilian
personnel are mainly recruited from those who have
passed the Recruitment Examination for Comprehensive
and General Service National Public Employees
conducted by the National Personnel Authority (NPA),
and those who have passed the Recruitment Examination
for Ministry of Defense Specialists conducted by the
MOD. After participating in the common training course,
civilian personnel recruited in this process work in a wide
range of fields.
Administrative officials are engaged in defenserelated policy planning in the Internal Bureaus of the
MOD and at the Acquisition, Technology and Logistics


Agency (ATLA); analysis and evaluation at the Defense
Intelligence Headquarters; and administrative works at
the SDF bases, the Regional Defense Bureaus, and other
locations throughout the country.
Technical and engineering officials are working
in the Internal Bureaus of the MOD, the ATLA, the
SDF bases, the Regional Defense Bureaus, and other
locations throughout the country. They are engaged in
constructing various defense facilities (headquarters,
runways, magazines, etc.), carrying out research and
development (R&D), efficient procurement, maintenance
and improvement of a range of equipment, as well as
providing mental health care for SDF personnel.
Instructors conduct advanced research on defense
and provide high-quality education to SDF personnel at
the National Institute for Defense Studies, the National
Defense Academy, the National Defense Medical
College, and other organizations.
In response to the “Directive for Organization and
Allocation of Personnel Expense in FY2021 to Proceed
with the Core Issue of the Cabinet Office” (decision
by the Prime Minister on July 21, 2020), which listed
“development of security arrangement while further
improving the efficiency of defense force development”
as one of the priority areas, the MOD has increased the
number of defense officials in FY2021 in preparation for
the implementation of NDPG and The Medium Term
Defense Program (MTDP).

See Reference 52 (Breakdown of Ministry of Defense Personnel, etc.)

The reemployment system for SDF pilots aims to prevent the outflow of active young SDF pilots to civil aviation companies in an unregulated manner. This system is also designed to utilize SDF pilots
over a certain age as pilots of commercial airlines, and is also significant from the perspective of the development of the airline industry in Japan as a whole.

Among the employees of the MOD, special national government employees are called “SDF personnel,” including administrative officials, technical and engineering officials, instructors, and others,

personnel in fields requiring high levels of expertise.
In addition, with the aim to promote manpower
saving and automation by leveraging technological
innovations such as artificial intelligence (AI), the MOD/
SDF is working on the establishment of the necessary
environment. For example, creating a support function
for AI utilization through the outsourcing of advisory
operations regarding such matters as the promotion of
AI utilization and through efforts aimed at recruiting AI/
data analysis officers and the education of SDF human
resources through outsourced courses.
In addition, in order to ensure an operating ratio with
a limited number of personnel, some MSDF vessels have
introduced a system of rotating shift duty among multiple
teams of crews to increase the number of operation days.
The introduction of this crew system to new types of
destroyers (FFM) is also being considered.

**1 Effective Use of Human Resources**


With regard to the personnel structure of the SDF, the
authorized number of SDF personnel has been on a
decline. On the other hand, there has been the need for
more-skilled personnel and personnel with expertise in
order to respond to the sophistication of equipment as
well as the diversification and internationalization of
SDF missions.
In light of such circumstances, while ensuring the
robustness of the SDF, the NDPG and others plan to raise
the mandatory early retirement age by one year during
the period of the MTDP, and another one year during the
period of the next MTDP in stages for each rank in order

To enable all SDF personnel to maintain high morale and
continue to fully exercise their ability, the NDPG and
the MTDP state that the MOD/SDF will improve living
and work environment. Specifically, to ensure readiness,
the SDF will accelerate its acquisition and renewal of
the necessary barracks and housing, and also promote
measures for deteriorated and earthquake-resistant
facilities. Additionally, it will steadily renew wornout living-related and work equipment, and secure the
requisite amount of daily consumables.
Because SDF personnel carry out their missions
under a severe environment, the SDF will improve
their treatment based on the special nature of their
missions and work environment. Specifically, in order
to ensure appropriate treatment in accordance with the

to improve their ability to respond to disasters. To enable
SDF personnel to fulfill their missions with high morale
and pride, the MOD/SDF will improve their treatment
through measures concerning honors and privileges,
including the enhancement of the defensive meritorious
badges to appropriately acknowledge their achievements.
In light of the severe recruitment environment, the Act
on Remuneration, etc., of Ministry of Defense Personnel
was revised in 2019 to raise salaries with a focus on
starting pay.

**3 Dealing with Retirement and Re-employment**
**of SDF Personnel and Related Matters**


strive to further improve re-employment support by
expanding vocational training subjects and support for
step-by-step acquisition of qualifications before their
retirement. The MOD also strives to further utilize
retired SDF personnel while strengthening collaboration
with local governments and related organizations from
the perspective of utilizing the knowledge, skills, and
experience of retired SDF personnel.
Specifically, as of the end of March 2021, a total of
612 retired SDF personnel work as crisis management
officers at local governments’ disaster prevention
bureaus — 46 prefectural bureaus have 104 of them
in total, and 431 municipal bureaus have 508. As this
strengthens collaboration with local governments and
enhances the ability to deal with crisis management,
including disaster prevention, the MOD/SDF will
continue active support for the utilization of retired SDF
personnel in local governments’ disaster prevention
bureaus by further enhancing these efforts.
MOD provides “Disaster Prevention and Crisis
Management Education” for SDF personnel scheduled
for retirement who seek employment in such sectors as
disaster prevention departments in local governments.
A person who completed the course is certified as a
“regional disaster prevention manager” by the Cabinet
Office on request. Previously, SDF personnel had to reach
the rank of “Sansa or higher or Ichii with the effective
work experience of a Sansa” to be certified. However,
in light of the actual conditions of the mission of SDF
personnel dispatched to disasters and other factors,
MOD/SDF negotiated the expansion of the conditions
for a regional disaster prevention manager, resulting in
the expansion to “Ichii or higher or Nii (First Lieutenant
(GSDF, ASDF)/Lieutenant Junior Grade (MSDF)) with
the effective work experience of an Ichii.”
In FY2021, in order to increase and enhance SDF
Reserve Personnel and SDF Ready Reserve Personnel, in
addition to uniformed SDF personnel in fixed-term system,
it was decided to provide a scholarship for uniformed SDF
personnel in fixed-term system upon retirement when they
enter university in Japan, after completing their tenure and
serve as SDF Reserve Personnel or SDF Ready Reserve
Personnel while at university.

See Fig. IV-1-1-5 (Major Vocational Training Provided to Support

Re-employment)
Fig. IV-1-1-6 (Re-employment Support in FY2020)

Meanwhile, with regard to the re-employment of
SDF personnel, new regulations about re-employment
were introduced in October 2015, replacing the former
prior approval system. As are the cases in other national
government employees, the following three regulations


**Chapter**


In order to maintain the strength of the SDF, many
uniformed SDF personnel retire in their mid-50s
(personnel serving under the early retirement system)
or in their 20s to mid-30s (uniformed SDF personnel
serving under the fixed-term service system). Therefore,
many of them need to find another job after retirement in
order to secure their livelihoods.
Since supporting re-employment is the responsibility
of the Japanese Government (the MOD) as the employer,
and is crucial both for resolving any concerns that
uniformed SDF personnel may have about their future as
well as for securing qualified human resources, the MOD
conducts support measures such as occupational training
useful for their re-employment.
In addition, as the MOD does not have the authority
to provide them with employment placement, the
Foundation for the SDF Personnel Support Association
provides free job consultation services for retired
SDF personnel with permission from the Minister of
Health, Labor and Welfare and the Minister of Land,
Infrastructure, Transport and Tourism.
Retired uniformed SDF personnel have excellent
abilities in planning, leadership, faculty, cooperativeness,
and responsibility gained through their work
performance, education and training. Furthermore, they
have various qualifications and licenses acquired through
their duties and vocational training. Therefore, they
are making positive contributions in a broad range of
sectors, including manufacturing and service industries,
as well as finance, insurance, real estate, and construction
industries, in addition to the areas of disaster prevention
and risk management at local governments.
Based on the NDPG and MTDP, the MOD/SDF will

**New SDF Graduates – Voices of Reemployed Personnel and Their Employers**

**Who are new SDF graduates?**
Fixed term service personnel who have completed their term of service in the SDF and seek employment in the private sector
are people who have already acquired basic professional qualities like discipline, a sense of responsibility, the ability to perform
and teamwork, through years of various training and rigorous exercises in the SDF. In order to avoid the misunderstanding that
such fixed-term SDF personnel “retired mid-career from the SDF,” it has been decided to refer to them as “new SDF graduates.”

centers), a website for the families of the dispatched SDF
personnel and similar facilities have been established
to provide consolation for the various questions and
concerns raised by the families.

**5 Initiatives to Maintain Rigorous Discipline**


The MOD/SDF has gained greater expectations from
Japanese people in recent years, and it is indispensable
for us to gain their support and trust all the time to fully
exercise our ability to complete our duties. In order to
meet their expectations to this end, the SDF personnel are
required to be an invariably disciplined existence more
than ever.
The MOD/SDF has so far strived to foster welldisciplined personnel by impressing in them an awareness
of compliance with the law through setting up periodic
campaigns, such as the “MOD Anti-Drug Abuse Month,”
“Self-Defense Forces Personnel Ethics Month,” and
“Self-Defense Personnel Harassment Prevention Week,”
and taking various effective measures such as thorough
instructions on service discipline.
The core element of defense capability is SDF
personnel; in order to exert organizational strength and
respond decisively to a wide range of situations, the SDF
must create a working environment that enables SDF
personnel to perform their tasks confidently with high
morale and sense of security.
Workplace harassment and bullying are major
problems; these acts could lead to a violation of the
dignity and human rights of SDF personnel, suicide
incidents, and adversely affect work environment. In
FY2016, the Power Harassment Hotline was established
in the Office of the Director, Honors and Discipline
Division, Bureau of Personnel & Education on a
permanent basis to respond to consultations from SDF
personnel over the phone and online. It’s reported that
the number of consultations from SDF personnel has
doubled year-on-year. The hotline received 252 such


**Chapter**


In addition to exchanges between units and personnel’s
families, as well as between the families, the MOD
in cooperation with relevant external groups and
organizations is also actively working to develop a
family support system to be implemented in the event of
large-scale natural disasters and other events, which will
include receiving cooperation in confirming the safety of
the family members of SDF personnel. All of these are
conducted as routine initiatives.
The MTDP also includes promotion of various
family support measures in order to ensure a sustainable
response posture for a long period of time. Specific
welfare services for SDF personnel deployed overseas
include facilitating direct communication with their
families in Japan by means such as e-mail and video
teleconference systems. Support for sending comfort
items from their families at a later date is also provided.
Moreover, briefing sessions for families of the dispatched
SDF personnel are held to provide them with a variety
of information, and a consultation desk exclusively for

MOD’s Power Harassment Hotline)

Workplace harassment is caused by the deficient
knowledge of it and the communication gap between
superiors and their subordinates. In order to resolve and
prevent these issues, the SDF provides (1) the classroom
training and remote learning to enhance understanding
and raise awareness of workplace harassment among SDF
personnel, (2) the education to promote understanding
including soft skills, and to enhance leadership
capabilities among SDF personnel (particularly those in
managerial positions), and (3) the measures to improve
and reinforce the consultation system.
For the purpose of eradicating disciplinary violations
such as assault, injury, and workplace harassment, the
standards of disciplinary actions were tightened in March
2020, and the SDF has taken a zero-tolerance approach
since then.
In addition to that, harassment consultation contact
points with alliance lawyers as the third party were
established in FY2020.


**6 Initiatives to Prevent Suicide among SDF**
**Personnel**

More than 100 SDF personnel committed suicide
annually during the period between FY2004 and FY2006.
Although the number has gradually declined since
FY2007, to 66 in FY2020, the loss still continues, with
more than 60 SDF personnel taking their own precious
lives. That fact is truly a tragic loss for the families of the
deceased, as well as a huge loss to the SDF.

See Fig. IV-1-1-8 (Change in the Number of SDF Personnel

Committing Suicide)

The survey of the suicide incidents in the SDF in
FY2019 confirmed that disproportionately large numbers
of suicide victims were young SDF personnel in their
teens and 20s, and middle-aged and older SDF personnel
in their 50s, and those suicides incidents frequently
occurred among SDF personnel who experienced changes
of work and/or living environments, which is one of risk
factors for suicide.
In light of such circumstances, evidence based
positive measures were taken in FY2020, such as
interviews with SDF personnel in order to find out
any troubles at work and home and proactive advice is
given to those with symptoms of mental illness to go for

outside counseling and/or receive medical consultations
at medical institutions.
Measures are also being implemented to prepare for
the period of July through September, when the number
of suicide incidents tends to increase. Since 2021, the
mental health awareness campaign months of June and
July have been set forth and promoted in order to suppress
the number of incidents.

**(2) Work Reform in the Workplace**
It is important that initiatives for the promotion of
work-life balance are implemented in a way which
fits the individual workplaces, and that staff members
themselves consider specific measures for improving
their workplace environment. This approach will lead to
developing effective initiatives and workplace climate.
Based on this perspective, since 2016, the annual
“Competition for Initiatives to Promote Working Style

by-step basis until FY2020, when it became possible
to telework in every organization. In particular, since
2020, many staff members have been teleworking to
prevent the spread of COVID-19. From the viewpoint
of business continuity in emergencies, the MOD/SDF
promotes the establishment of a telework environment
through digitalization including the computerization of
documents as well as the installation of more terminals.

**(4) Development of an Environment that Enables Staff**
**to Realize a Successful Career While Engaging in**
**Childrearing and Nursing Care**

The MOD/SDF has developed various schemes, which
enable staff to balance work with childrearing/nursing
care, such as ensuring substitute personnel for staff who
take childcare leave and other leave. In particular, the
ministry is encouraging its male staff to take childcare
leave to promote their participation in family settings.
Since FY2020, the ministry is strongly working to enable
all male staff with a newborn child to take childcare leave
or time off work for a total of one month or more. Also
the target rate of childcare leave acquisition by male staff
is set at 30% by FY2025.
The MOD/SDF is also developing an environment that
enables staff to balance work life with their family life by
distributing e-mail newsletters to help its staff to return


to work smoothly after childcare leave and encouraging
staff to use a “childcare form” to facilitate managers’ and
the human resources department’s thorough and detailed
understanding of the situation regarding childcare.
The MOD/SDF has a system to rehire SDF personnel
who have previously resigned mid-career. It reassessed
the system so that former SDF personnel who had resigned
in their mid-career due to childrearing and nursing care
could be reemployed from January 2017. The MOD/SDF
started recruitment based on this system in January 2018.

**(5) Ensuring Childcare Services**
To allow SDF personnel who are rearing children to
concentrate on their duties, it is important to ensure
childcare services tailored to the irregular working patterns
unique to the SDF. Since April 2007, the MOD/SDF has
set up workplace nurseries at GSDF Camp Mishuku,
GSDF Camp Kumamoto, GSDF Camp Makomanai,
GSDF Asaka Camp housing district, MSDF Yokosuka
Naval Base district, ASDF Iruma Air Base, Ichigaya
district, where the MOD is located, and National Defense
Medical College. In the event of emergency operations
such as disaster relief, the MOD promotes measures to
provide temporary childcare in SDF camps and bases for
children of SDF personnel who have no alternative but to
attend to duties with their children.

For the further expansion of the recruitment and

**2** **Reform for Promoting Active Participation of Women**

promotion of female personnel, the MOD/SDF has
been making various efforts to advance the careers of
motivated and qualified female personnel by setting
up specific goals with regard to the recruitment and
promotion of female personnel under the Action Plan.
Moreover, the MOD formulated the “Initiative to
Promote Active Engagement of Female SDF Personnel
– Aiming for Attractive SDF that Adapts to the Times
and Environment” (the “Initiative”) in April 2017 to
specify its conceptual policy for promoting the active
participation of female SDF personnel.

**(1) Significance of Promoting Active Engagement of Female**
**SDF Personnel and Personnel Management Policy**

The “Initiative” outlines the significance of promoting
the active participation of female personnel and the
MOD/SDF personnel management policy. Specifically,
with SDF duties becoming increasingly diverse and
complex, SDF personnel are required, more than ever,
to have multifaceted capabilities including higher levels
of knowledge, decision-making ability, and skills. In
addition, under a severe recruitment environment due


to the declining birthrate and continuing trend of higher
education, it is anticipated that the number of SDF
personnel with time and location restraints, including
those involved in childcare, nursing care, and other
responsibilities, will significantly increase.
In light of these changes, the SDF is required to evolve
from a conventional organization with an emphasis on
homogeneity among the members, into an organization
that is capable of incorporating diverse human resources
in a flexible manner.
At present, the largest human resource that the SDF has
not been able to fully utilize is women, who account for
half of the population targeted for recruitment. Promoting
the active engagement of female SDF personnel has
the following significance: (1) securing useful human
resources; (2) utilizing diverse perspectives; and
(3) reflecting values of the nation. For this reason, the
MOD/SDF has decided to open up a path for female
personnel with motivation, ability, and aptitude to have
opportunities to demonstrate their abilities in various fields,
and aim for doubling the ratio of female SDF personnel.
In terms of employing and promoting female SDF
personnel, the MOD/SDF sets out a personnel management

**(2) Removal of the Assignment Restriction of Female**
**SDF Personnel**

The MOD/SDF has been reviewing the restriction of
assignment of female personnel. With the removal of
the restriction on female assignments in submarines in
December 2018, the restriction against females was
completely removed with the exception of the units
where female personnel cannot be assigned for reasons
of maternity protection (a part of the GSDF Nuclear
Biological Chemical (NBC) Weapon Defense Unit

[chemical] and Tunnel Company Units).
With the removal of the restriction on female
assignments, the first female fighter pilot and the first
female paratrooper went on duty in 2018 and March 2020
respectively. Moreover, female SDF personnel began
serving onboard submarines in October 2020.


personnel and the proportion of female SDF personnel
among total SDF personnel have increased to 17% in and
after FY2021 and 12% or higher by FY2030 respectively.
Specifically, in order to increase the number of recruits
through the increase in the scheduled number of female
recruits, the SDF will actively recruit women, promote
their active participation, and improve education, living,
and work environments for female SDF personnel.
In addition, with regard to promotion, MDO/SDF
aims to increase the proportion of women among SDF
personnel with a rank of field officer or higher to 5% or
higher by the end of FY2025.

See Fig. IV-1-2-1 (Changes in Incumbent Female SDF Personnel)

b. Female Administrative Officials, Technical and
Engineering Officials, Instructors, and Others
As of the end of March 2021, the number of female
civilian personnel — administrative officials, technical
and engineering officials, and instructors, and others —
is approximately 3,500 (about 25.6% of total civilian
personnel). Compared with ten years ago (end of March
2011 when females made up 23.3% of the total civilian
personnel), this is a rise of 2.3 percentage points,
indicating that the ratio of female civilian personnel is on
a rising trend in recent years.
With regard to recruitment, in line with the overall
government target, the MOD has set up its goal of
ensuring that women account for over 35% of recruits
in and after FY2021. Regarding promotion, as a goal
to be achieved by the end of FY2025, the proportion of
women of the Unit-Chief level at the ministry proper or
equivalent would be 35%, the proportion of women of
the Division-Director level at local organizations and
Assistant-Division-Director level at the ministry proper
or equivalent would be 10%, the proportion of women
of the Division-Director level at the ministry proper or
equivalent would be 6%, and the proportion of women of

in Tokyo and Osaka, on May 24, 2021, and is currently
conducting vaccinations.
Using the lessons learned through the activities in
response to the spread of the COVID-19 infection, the
MOD/SDF is further strengthening its hygiene functions
by implementing measures as follows in the first and
second 2020 supplementary budgets: preparation of
medical equipment including respirators and negative
pressure equipment to accept infected patients,
ambulances necessary for transportation of infected
people, protective clothing necessary for handling
COVID-19 and CT diagnosis vehicles and medical
equipment that can be deployed to the field for pneumonia
diagnosis.
In addition, the SDF Central Hospital and the NDMC
Hospital conducted a clinical test of the anti-viral drug
favipiravir (Avigan[®]) for COVID-19. Since March 2020,
MOD has gained experience in using Avigan[®] Tablets
for treatment under the framework of compassionate
use and also participated in the confirmation process
through clinical tests for the effectiveness of Avigan[®]
Tablets necessary for their formal approval as therapeutic
medication for COVID-19. MOD/SDF plays an active
role not only in the treatment of COVID-19 but also in
the development of therapeutic medication.


The SDF Central Hospital and the NDMC Hospital
also conduct drills for infectious disease response. For
example, the SDF Central Hospital works to establish
cooperation procedures with relevant institutions by
regularly conducting drills for accepting patients of
infectious diseases under the assumption that there are
Type I Infectious Disease patients. These drills benefited
activities in the face of COVID-19 outbreaks.
In September 2020, the SDF Central Hospital
cooperated with the Setagaya Medical Association, the
Japanese DMAT, the Metropolitan Police Department, the
Tokyo Fire Department, and others as well as the GSDF
Eastern Army and the GSDF Medical School to conduct a
drill for accepting large numbers of injured persons under
the assumption that simultaneous terrorist attacks had
occurred during a large-scale sports event. In November
2020, it conducted a drill for accepting patients of
infectious diseases to confirm acceptance procedures for
novel influenza patient during the COVID-19 epidemic
as part of its ongoing efforts to strengthen cooperation
with relevant institutions and enhance its capabilities as a
medical institution equivalent to a disaster base hospital.

In this context, the NDPG and the MTDP state that the

in medical care, such as medical officers, due to the
diversification of missions, less than 90% of medical
officer positions have been filled, although the rate has
been improving year by year. Such low sufficiency is
caused by medical officers leaving the SDF, one of the
major reasons of which is the lack of opportunity to
engage in medical training and practice. The MOD/SDF
continues to implement various measures with diversified
career options to prevent medical officers from leaving
the SDF by enhancing clinical education after graduation
from the NDMC and other institutions, promoting
various initiatives for ensuring more opportunities for
medical officers to engage in medical practice, helping
them acquire and improve specialized knowledge and
skills in areas such as infectious diseases and emergency
medicine, as well as increasing their motivation for work.


officers, and improve the conditions for providing highquality medical care either equaling or surpassing other
university hospitals. The MOD/SDF will also enhance
research functions of the NDMC Research Institute and
collaboration with medical care departments of the GSDF,
MSDF, and Air Self-Defense Force (ASDF). Through
these initiatives, the MOD/SDF will further enhance the
education/research conditions at the college.
The NDMC Research Institute started advanced
research of defense medicine in FY2015 and has been
conducting research contributing to SDF troop operation,
which includes research on explosion trauma and damage
caused by shock waves.

Through these measures, the MOD/SDF is working to
improve the sufficiency of medical officers and maintain
and improve their medical skills. In the MTDP, the MOD/
SDF will continue efforts to improve the sufficiency of
medical officers and further promote the appointment
of SDF Reserve Personnel who are physicians to handle
missions that are expected to increase.
Similar measures are taken for nursing officers to
maintain and improve their knowledge/skills through
practice at external hospitals, etc.
Moreover, medical personnel and medical staff, such
as radiological technologists, clinical technologists, and
emergency life-saving technicians, are educated and trained
at SDF hospitals, schools and other relevant institutions so
that the SDF can perform diverse missions and missions
under special circumstances, including international peace
cooperation activities and large-scale disasters.

based on the “Research and Development Vision”
(see Paragraph 3 below). At the same time, the MOD
also promotes research and development that serve as
the foundation of defense force building, technology
exchange with relevant domestic/overseas agencies,
and “Innovative Science & Technology Initiative for
Security” (see 4-2) and intermediary research to apply
their results to equipment, etc.
(iii) Protection of Technologies
The MOD implements technology control for proper
technology transfer to prevent situations in which Japan’s
technology leaks without the country’s intention, which
would undermine the maintenance of peace and security
in the international community or the ensuring of Japan’s
technological superiority. The MOD also establishes
intellectual property management taking into account
the transfer of defense equipment and promotes the
utilization of intellectual property.

fields that need to be developed in order to ensure Japan’s
technological superiority. It is expected that making this
Outlook public will facilitate the integration of superior
civilian advanced technologies and the development
of technologies outside of the MOD aimed at defense
equipment applications. Review is now underway for
taking a more strategic approach to important technologies,
including technologies pertaining to new domains and
other potentially game-changing technologies such as AI.

**3 “Research and Development (R&D) Vision”**


The “Research and Development (R&D) Vision” presents
principles on R&D, technological challenges, and roadmaps
on R&D of the technologies required for our future defense
capability for the purpose of conducting advanced R&D
systematically from a mid-to-long term viewpoint.
The MOD publishes R&D Vision, and shares them
with the defense industry, with the aim of increasing
predictability for relevant companies, promoting prior
investment, and realizing more effective and efficient
research and development by maximally exploiting the
investment. So far, the MOD has published the “R&D
Vision on the Future Fighter Aircraft” (2010), and the
“R&D Vision on Future Unmanned Equipment: Focusing
on Unmanned Aerial Vehicle” (2016), and the “Research

greatly shorten the research and development periods
of a Hyper Velocity Gliding Projectile Intended for
the Defense of Remote Islands, unmanned underwater
vehicles (UUV) with convertible mission modules,
standoff electronic warfare aircraft and other equipment
through the use of initiatives such as block approach and
modularization. New technologies such as AI and lasers
are the subject of demonstrations by the Acquisition,
Technology & Logistics Agency to enable users to
imagine how these technologies will be used, while a
concrete image of future equipment is being developed
by collecting information on their technical feasibility
from private companies and other parties at an early stage
and fully analyzing the information.

in April 2020 to efficiently conduct the development of the
F-X to be a successor of the F-2 fighter jet. Development
has begun in October 2020 with the contract being concluded
with Mitsubishi Heavy Industries, Ltd. as a prime company
in charge of integrating the fighter as a whole.
In developing the F-X, the MOD has decided to advance
this program with necessary support and cooperation from
the U.S., such as selecting the U.S. company Lockheed
Martin as the candidate for an integration support
company in December 2020, and starting a new project
on data link connection with the U.S. from FY2021 to
ensure interoperability between Japan and the U.S. Also,
the MOD has continued discussions with the US and the
U.K. to pursue the possibility of collaboration on the F-X
at a system level such as engine and avionics in order to
reduce development cost and technical risk.

it is necessary to assign maximum value to freedom of
research when sponsoring research, so that, for example,
researchers will be able to publish all of their research
results to have a wide range of academic discussions.
Hence, in this program, the MOD will neither restrict
contractors’ publication of research results, nor designate
research results as confidential, never providing any
confidential data to researchers. In actuality, some
research results have already been published through oral
presentations, publications, etc.
Active utilization of advanced civilian technology
through such programs is not only essential for securing
the lives and peaceful livelihood of the Japanese people
into the future, but is also beneficial for the development
of Japan’s science, technology and innovation in
non-defense areas as well, similar to how investment
in innovative technology by the Defense Advanced
Research Projects Agency (DARPA) of the United States
facilitated advances in science and technology as a whole
including civilian technology, such as the development
of the Internet and GPS. From this perspective, the MOD
intends to promote relevant measures and strives to raise
awareness of this program that contributes to ensuring
the freedom of study and its sound development.
Bridging Research was launched in FY2020
to expedite the identification and development of
promising, advanced technologies from the results
of basic research under the Innovative Science &
Technology Initiative for Security and other sources,
enhance their readiness level, and apply them to the
research and development of equipment. Bridging
Research will be conducted aggressively in FY2021
with the aim of helping to generate equipment that will
be gamechangers in the future.

See Fig. IV-2-2-3 (FY2020 Awarded Research Projects for the

“Innovative Science & Technology Initiative for Security”

**2 Identifying and Developing Innovative**
**Technologies and Their Seeds**

In FY2015, the MOD launched a competitive research
funding program called “Innovative Science &
Technology Initiative for Security” to publicly seek
and commission basic research on advanced civilian
technologies, which are expected to contribute to future
research and development in defense areas. A total of 95
research projects were awarded[7] by FY2020, and this
program was expanded in FY2017 in order to enable
the awarding of larger-scale and longer-term research
projects. The program will continue to run on a similar
scale in FY2021 (total budget of about 10.1 billion yen).
In the basic research areas, free thinking of researchers
leads to innovative and creative results. For this reason,

In this regard, the MOD will expand the items subject

**2** **Improving the Contract System and Other Related Matters**

**1 Reviewing Acquisition Systems** **2 Long-Term Contracts, etc.**


For the purpose of promoting acquisition reform, which is
a prompt response to swiftly changing surroundings, the
MOD has been holding meetings of the Comprehensive
Acquisition Reform Committee since 2007, in addition to
the Contractual Systems Study Groups held since 2010
to review acquisition systems. Since FY2016, a special
research officer system[3] has been adopted in order to
surely bring the review results to fruition.


for the specifications and the review of project plans with
consideration of life cycle costs. Furthermore, for more
efficient acquisition, during the equipment selection
phase, the MOD will implement thorough life cycle
cost estimation, and analysis of alternatives, and secure
binding obligations against company principals.

**2 Long-Term Contracts, etc.**

The production of defense equipment requires a
significant amount of time. Therefore, if a certain amount
is to be procured in bulk, a contract for more than five
years is needed in many cases. With regard to defense
equipment and services, economies of scale[4] tend not to
work mainly due to the following reasons: (1) the MOD
is the only customer; and (2) companies that provide
such defense equipment, etc., are limited. In addition, it
is difficult for companies to systematically move forward


This is a system to conduct research, which contributes to the acquisition system of defense equipment, by inviting experts, such as associate professors from different universities specializing in the
areas of concern, in order to review and reconsider an effective procurement system, based not only on the viewpoints of the MOD personnel but also on theories that have been proposed in the field
of business administration and economics.

with their businesses with a high degree of predictability,
which is peculiar to the defense industry.
For these reasons, the upper limit of acts that incur
national debt prescribed in the Public Finance Act as
within five years in principle was changed to within ten
years for specific equipment through the enactment of
the Long-term Contract Act.[5] The introduction of this
change regarding long-term contracts will make stable
procurement possible, leading to the realization of the
systematic improvement of defense capability. At the
same time, for companies, given that the procurement
amount will be assured, the systematic use of personnel
and equipment, as well as cost reductions due to bulk
orders, will be made possible.

See Fig. IV-2-3-2 (Image of Long-term Contracts and the Cost

Part II, Chapter 4, Section 2-3 (Initiatives for Increasing the
Efficiency of Procurement), p. 233

In addition, by realizing longer-term multiple-year
contracts utilizing the Private Finance Initiative (PFI)
Act,[6] the planned acquisition and execution of budgets

are obtained, such as cutting equipment procurement
costs, by reducing risks for those taking orders and

using the PFI Act, the MOD launched a total of approx.
25.4 billion yen the “project of development and operation
of X-band satellite communications” in January 2013
and the “project of operation and management of private
ships” in March 2016.
In addition, regarding procurement of certain
equipment with which little competitiveness can be
expected due to its characteristics, and companies that
work on cost reduction using the MOD’s programs, the
MOD promotes limited tendering contracts while ensuring
transparency and fairness as well as clarifying and
putting the subject into patterns, from the perspective of
the implementation of smooth and efficient procurement,
and the enhancement of the company’s predictability.
Specifically, in acquiring new destroyers (FFM),[7] the
MOD adopted a procurement method in February 2017
that selects the party that has made the best proposal with
respect to the MOD’s requirements as the procurement
counterparty, with the runner-up also involved in
designing and building facilities as a subcontractor.
This made it possible to acquire the new destroyers
efficiently equipped with the necessary functions and
to maintain and strengthen the construction technology
base. The MOD concluded a proposal agreement in April
2017 and decided on a procurement counterparty and a
subcontractor in August 2017.


“Special Measures Law Concerning the Term of Expenditure Based on the Obligatory Assurance of National Subsidization for Specific Defense Procurement” (enacted in April 2015. An act for its partial
revision to extend the effective period by five years was enacted in March 2019.)

Act on Promotion of Private Finance Initiative


-----

introduced in June 2019, to some projects.
Under this system, the public and private sectors
jointly manage the performance and progress of the
contract and manage the cost and minimize risks. When
the cost is reduced, part of the reduction is awarded to
the contractor. This system is aimed at reducing the price
while incentivizing the contractor to reduce the cost.
Since April 2020, a system to give an incentive for cost
reduction has been in operation in order to fairly evaluate
cost reduction efforts by companies.

**3 Decrease Procurement Cost and Improve**
**Companies’ Incentives to Reduce Cost**

With regard to the procurement of defense equipment,
the cost is tending to increase because a large variety
of equipment has no market price. Based on those
characteristics, it is necessary to achieve both the
reduction of procurement cost and improvement of
companies’ incentives to reduce cost simultaneously.
To achieve this, the ATLA is applying the incentivized
risk-sharing management contract system, which was


**Chapter**


With regard to periodic maintenance of defense
equipment, the MOD has been working to improve
efficiency by extending the maintenance interval, after
making sufficient efforts to ensure safety. Moreover,
the MOD is working to expand umbrella contracts
such as performance based logistics (PBL)[8] from the
perspective of improving the equipment’s operational
availability and keeping long-term costs reduced. In the
FY2021 budget, the MOD is pursuing cost reduction
by purchasing a certain quantity of UH-60J rescue
helicopters and by utilizing long-term contracts for the
bulk purchase of airframe structural parts for the F-2
fighter aircraft among others.

**2 Achieving Further Efficiency in**
**the Acquisition of Defense Equipment**


**3 Efforts to Increase Fairness and Transparency**

The MOD implements measures for making contracts
more appropriate and strengthening checking functions
to promote the enhancement of fairness and transparency
in relation to the acquisition of equipment and materials.
As a part of the effort to “make public procurement
more appropriate” across the whole government, the
MOD continues to carry out the introduction and
expansion of a comprehensive evaluation bidding system[9]
and make bidding procedures more efficient. In addition
to these, based on reflection on the past, strengthening
system investigation, reviewing penalties, ensuring the
effectiveness of supervision and inspection, and other
measures have steadily been carried out in order to prevent
recurrence of such incidents as overcharging and falsified
results of equipment testing by defense-related companies
in 2012. Through these measures, the MOD strives to
surely prevent recurrence of scandals, enhance fairness
and transparency, and make contracts more appropriate.
In addition, ATLA carries out multilayered checks
through both internal and external checking systems
and checks and balances within the organization –
namely, ATLA further enhances internal inspections
by the inspection and audit department, and through
deliberations in the Defense Procurement Council,


When acquiring defense equipment, the MOD aims
to reduce development, acquisition, and maintenance
expenses through the development of product families,
standardization of equipment specifications, joint
procurement of equipment common to multiple SDF
services, etc., in addition to a review of the contract
system. For example, in the FY2021 budget, cost
reduction is expected by using existing equipment in the
development of a sonar for future submarines.
In addition, the MOD has been facilitating the
compilation of a database on the breakdown of

by the Arms Export Control Act (AECA) etc. that may
enable the U.S. allies and others to purchase defense
equipment and services from the U.S. government.
The characteristics of FMS include: (1) pricing is an
estimate, (2) payments are made in advance in principle
and balanced out after fulfillment, and (3) the delivery
date is an estimate. This program allows Japan to procure
equipment with a high level of confidentiality that cannot
be generally purchased through Direct Commercial Sales
and highly capable equipment. Therefore, FMS is critical
to strengthen Japan’s defense capabilities.
Meanwhile, there are FMS-related challenges,
such as late delivery and late case closure. As the FMS
procurement amount is hovering at a high level in recent
years, the governments of Japan and the U.S. have been
actively working together to make improvements in
these challenges. Specifically, the ATLA and Defense
Security Cooperation Agency (DSCA) held the Security
Cooperation Consultative Meeting (SCCM) to discuss the
challenges over FMS procurement, five times since 2016.
At the 4th SCCM in January 2020, as for late delivery
and late case closure, ATLA and DSCA agreed to make
efforts such as the timely confirmation of the status of

delivery and case closure on each item. As the result of
stricter management of FMS cases through Japan-U.S.
cooperation including these efforts, the amounts of late
delivery and late case closure as of March 31, 2020 was
approximately 16.6 billion yen and 33.2 billion yen
respectively, a reduction of approximately 16.0 billion
(approximately 49%) and 16.1 billion yen (33%) for the
amounts of late delivery and late case closure respectively.
At the 5th SCCM in January 2021, as further efforts
for late delivery and late case closure, ATLA and DSCA
agreed to make efforts such as strengthening case
management for major platform cases and maintaining
and strengthening efforts to systematically take measures
to address and eliminate causes of late delivery and late
case closure after analyzing them. DSCA also agreed
regarding transparency in pricing to provide guidance
to the relevant organizations in the U.S. Department
of Defense on providing cost information and would
provide assistance to solve the various issues arising
from FMS-procured items’ cost transparency. The MOD
will continue to strengthen the posture of managing FMS
procurement[10] and take other measures to promote the
rationalization of FMS procurement.

3 According to the survey of defense demand dependence based on sales performance conducted in FY2019 (150 defense-related companies responded), the ratio of defense demand dependence fell
from the approximately 5% average in the previous year because a larger number of companies with low defense demand dependence responded. Although relatively small in scale, some companies
possess important technologies for supporting the defense industry with over 50% of the defense demand dependence, in which case the scale of defense demand has a significant impact on the
management of these companies.

sovereignty of security, (2) potentially contribute to increasing
deterrence capability, and maintain and improve bargaining
power, and (3) contribute to the sophistication of the domestic
industry in Japan driven by cutting-edge technology.
**(3) Basic Viewpoints for Promoting Measures**
For the promotion of measures, the MOD takes into account
the following basic viewpoints: (1) establishing longterm partnership between the private and public sectors;
(2) strengthening international competitiveness; and (3)
ensuring consistency with efficient and optimized acquisition
of defense equipment.
**(4) Defense Equipment Procurement Methods**
With regard to defense equipment procurement, currently
multiple methods, such as domestic development,
international joint development and production, licensed
domestic production, utilization of commercially produced
goods, and imports, are adopted. These methods directly
affect the defense production and technological bases.
According to the characteristics of defense equipment, the
MOD appropriately selects acquisition methods, including
international joint development and production, which have
become more agile and flexible due to the Three Principles
on Transfer of Defense Equipment and Technology.
**(5) Measures for Maintaining and Strengthening**
**Defense Production and Technological Bases**

In order to maintain and strengthen defense production and

technological bases, the MOD will promote the following

measures with a focus on variation and efficiency, while
considering Japan’s severe fiscal condition: (1) improvement
in the contract system; (2) initiatives in research and
development; (3) promotion of defense equipment
and technology cooperation; (4) initiatives for defense
industrial organizations including the building of robust
production and technological bases through understanding
actual situations of the supply chain; (5) strengthening of
the MOD’s functions through the establishment of ATLA,[5]
etc.; and (6) collaboration with other relevant ministries and
government agencies.
**(6) Current Situation and Courses of Action for Each**
**Defense Equipment Sector**

With regard to the main defense equipment sectors
(such as land equipment, supplies, etc., ships, aircraft,
explosives, guided weapons, communications electronics
and command control systems, unmanned equipment,
space and cyber systems), the MOD will analyze the
current situation of defense production and technological
bases. At the same time, based on the priority matters
for developing the SDF’s structure indicated in the 2013
NDPG, the MOD will present the future direction of the
maintenance and strengthening of defense production
and technological bases and the acquisition plan for each
defense equipment sectors, and thereby, seek to increase
predictability for companies.

Technological Bases, the MOD has implemented
various measures contributing to the maintenance and
strengthening of the defense industrial base, such as


-----

improving the contract system, including the enactment
of the Long-term Contract Act, and the establishment of
ATLA, which integrated the organizations involved in the
defense equipment procurement.
In addition, the following new measures are also taken
in ATLA: (1) formulation of Defense Technology Strategy,
etc. for ensuring the technological superiority, and
implementation of the “Innovative Science & Technology
Initiative for Security” (see Section 2); (2) formulation
of the Acquisition Strategic Plan for promoting project
management, and improvement of contract systems (see
Section 3); (3) grasping the supply chain in the defense
industry and responses to risks in order to maintain and
strengthen the defense industrial base (see Paragraph
2 below); and (4) participation of Japanese companies
in the international F-35 fighter aircraft program and
defense equipment and technology cooperation involving
joint research and development with other countries (see
Section 5).

**2 Initiatives Based on the NDPG**


Past supply chain surveys revealed the presence of small
and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) that have a high
dependency rate on defense equipment. In the supply chain
survey conducted by the end of FY2019,[6] key suppliers
holding irreplaceable technologies were identified.
Additionally, vulnerabilities became apparent, such as
a concentration of orders to a certain supplier. Based on
the survey results, the MOD is creating a database of the
results of the supply chain survey, and building a regular
monitoring system for early identification of risks, such as
supply disruption.
Furthermore, the MOD is making efforts to identify
SMEs that have excellent technologies/products and
initiating support in FY2021 for business transfer when an
enterprise in the supply chain withdraws from the business.
The MOD will also accurately deal with the vulnerabilities
in the supply chain and strengthen the supply chain through
initiatives such as evaluation of the possibility of application
of innovative technologies represented by the 3D printer
and AI to the manufacturing process of defense equipment.
**(3) Further Industrial Participation of Japan’s Defense**
**Industry in Sustainment and Maintenance of**
**Imported Equipment**

Industrial participation in the sustainment and maintenance
business of imported equipment is productive for the
strengthening of Japan’s industrial base. For this purpose, it
is important to pursue participation in the sustainment and
maintenance of F-35A fighter aircraft, Osprey, and other
imported equipment and benefits for domestic companies
through further promotion of joint R&D of high-capability
equipment with the United States and other countries.[7]

**(4) Promoting Appropriate Overseas Transfer of**
**Defense Equipment under the Three Principles on**
**Transfer of Defense Equipment and Technology**

The government as a whole will work on necessary
improvement in implementation of related rules for
promoting appropriate overseas transfer of defense
equipment. At the same time, the MOD will strengthen
intellectual property management, technology control
and information security to prevent leakages of important
technologies regarding defense equipment.
a. Initiatives for Necessary Operational Improvement
The MOD, in cooperation with relevant ministries
and agencies, will work on necessary improvement in
implementation of related rules based on the Three Principles
on Transfer of Defense Equipment and Technology, which
are the operational standards for the Foreign Exchange
and Foreign Trade Act. As a result, the MOD will enhance
predictability for the defense industry and will promote
appropriate and smooth equipment transfer.


**Chapter**


In order to strengthen Japan’s defense industrial base,
which is essential to the production, operation, sustainment
and maintenance of defense equipment, the MOD will work
on the following initiatives based on the NDPG, etc., while
considering the orientation of the defense production and
technology strategy.
**(1) Reforming the Existing Contract System towards**
**Creating a Competitive Environment among Companies**

Japan’s defense industry is in a less competitive
environment as there are many defense equipment items
that only one company can produce. To address this issue,
the MOD will review the existing contract system towards
creation of a competitive environment among companies by
actively evaluating initiatives and results which contribute
to strengthening the competitiveness of the defense industry
and cost reduction, as well as giving appropriate incentives
based on the evaluation result.
**(2) Strengthening Risk Management of Supply Chain**
**for Defense Equipment**

The procurement of defense equipment involves not only
prime companies that directly contract with the MOD but
also supplier companies in a broad range of fields and sizes,
which contract with the prime companies. The chains of these
companies (supply chains) are the basis of Japan’s defense
industry. However, these supply chains are confronted with
risks, such as supply disruption due to withdrawing or
bankruptcy of some manufacturing companies. In order to
deal with the risks, the MOD is taking measures in order to
maintain and strengthen the supply chains.


By the end of FY2019, the MOD conducted a supply chain survey of 60 major defense equipment items.

SM-3 block IIA, jointly developed by Japan and the United States, is subject to FMS procurement, but Japanese companies have received contracts for manufacturing about half of the components,


-----

Specifically, it is necessary to improve the implementation
of relevant systems and procedures, which include
rationalization of the handling of basic marketing
information necessary for early business talks at
international trade shows, etc.,[8] in order to ensure the
smooth provision of such information.
b. Preventing Leakage of Key Technologies
(a) Intellectual Property Management
Through the application of more appropriate contract
provisions regarding intellectual property, the MOD will
accurately grasp intellectual property generated through
R&D, etc., to promote the clarification of public or private
belongings and prevention of leakages of key technologies
to abroad. The ministry will also present options regarding
the opening or closing of intellectual properties based on the
characteristics of the technology and promotes appropriate
management for each option.
(b) Technology Control
The MOD is working to prevent technology leakage by
such means as ensuring prompt and proper assessment
of technological sensitivity based on the importance and
superiority of the technologies, which is needed in the
examination of the propriety of overseas transfer of defense
equipment and technology. Also, in order to prevent
leakages of sensitive technologies, the MOD, in cooperation
with relevant ministries and agencies, promotes studies on
reverse engineering countermeasure technologies, such as
black box constitution.
(c) Strengthening Information Security
For Japan’s defense industry to participate in international
businesses, it is necessary to respond to increasing threats
of cyber attacks. With the aim of strengthening information
security measures, the MOD will review the information
security standard applicable to contractors handling the
MOD’s information to be protected.[9]

In order to further encourage companies to consider
entry into defense procurement business and facilitate
their business with defense-related companies in Japan and
abroad, it is important to improve the predictability of the
necessary security measures for the companies. For this
purpose, the MOD will develop an information security
guidebook that comprehensively defines security measures
that will normally be required for concluding a contract,
which involves the handling of information to be secured,
with the MOD in advance.
**(5) Other Initiatives to Achieve Efficiency and Strength**
Other than the above-mentioned initiatives, the MOD/SDF
will undertake measures such as making the equipment


manufacturing process efficient and thoroughly reducing
cost and will strive to make Japan’s defense industry base
efficient and resilient while foreseeing possible realignment
and consolidation of businesses that may occur as a result
of these measures.

**3 Cooperation/Collaboration with the Industry**


The maintenance and strengthening of Japan’s technological
and industrial base are essential for production, operation
and maintenance of defense equipment. For the effort
of “Reinforcing Technology Base” and “Strengthening
Defense Industrial Base” that are provided in NDPG and
MTDP, cooperation between the MOD and the industry is
indispensable.
In this context, in October 2019, Defense Minister Kono
and executives of the Japan Business Federation exchanged
opinions on a wide range of themes, including international
situations and defense policy in addition to defense
equipment policy, and discussed the strengthening of publicprivate cooperation in general. Since November of the same
year, ATLA and the Defense Industry Committee of the
Japan Business Federation had exchanged opinions on eight
occasions on “Overseas Transfer of Defense Equipment
and Technology,” “Maintaining and Strengthening Supply
Chains,” “Aggressive Utilization of Advanced Civilian
Technology,” “Strengthening Information Security,” and
other issues. The outcome of the sessions was reported to
Defense Minister Kishi and executives of the Japan Business
Federation and received their approval in December 2020.
The MOD will continue the initiatives for strengthening
public-private cooperation, including opinion exchange
with the industry in order to strengthen the defense
industrial and technological bases as is explicitly stated
in the NDPG.

In October 2018, the Q&A section of the Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry website made it clear that information on the performance of goods and other matters that is used in early stage
business talks and that does not include “specific information necessary for design, manufacture or use,” such as design information and production technique, is not subject to regulation under the
Foreign Exchange Act. At the request of companies, the MOD is currently confirming the range of information included in data created by a company that may be disclosed to the public and handled
as publicly known technology available to an unspecified large number of people.i

**2** **Deepening Relationships with the United States regarding Defense Equipment and**
**Technology Cooperation**


For the procurement of F-35A fighters in FY2019 and
after, the MOD compared the unit price assuming the
participation of domestic companies in the production
with the import price of completed aircraft. Since the
latter was lower, the Government decided to import
completed F-35A fighters in order to promptly procure
the necessary number while at the same time efficiently
strengthening Japan’s defense capabilities under the
severe fiscal circumstances.
Later, however, as a result of cost reduction efforts
by the manufacturers, including improvement in the
manufacturing process and reduction of person-hours
through work skill improvement, it was confirmed that
the FACO by domestic companies would make the price
lower than importing completed aircraft. For this reason,
for the FY2019, FY2020 and FY2021 procurement, the
MOD decided to procure F-35A fighters finally assembled
and completed by domestic companies.[4]
The continuing participation of domestic companies
in the manufacturing of F-35 fighters is meaningful in
that it ensures operational and maintenance bases as well
as the sustainment, development and advancement of
fighter-related technology bases through working with
cutting-edge fighter technologies and knowhow, which
will eventually contribute to strengthening of the defense
technological and industrial bases.
As global operation of F-35 fighter aircraft is
anticipated, the U.S. Government plans to establish
maintenance depot (regional MRO&U Capability)
mainly for airframes and engines in the North America,
Europe, and the Asia-Pacific regions.
In December 2014, with regard to regional MRO&U
in the Asia-Pacific region for the F-35 fighter aircraft, the
U.S. Government announced the following decisions:
(1) Regional MRO&U Capability for airframes will be
provided by Japan and Australia with both capabilities
required not later than early 2018; (2) with regard to
the regional MRO&U Capability for engines, initial
capability will be provided by Australia by early 2018,
with Japan providing additional capability at least 3-5
years later.[5] In February 2019, the U.S. government
announced the assignment of MRO&U capability in
the Asia-Pacific area for certain avionics components of
the F-35 fighter to Japan. These component MRO&Us
will begin activating in 2025, with timing informed by

In addition, with regard to the transfer of parts for
Patriot PAC-2, software and parts, etc. for the Aegis
System and F100 engine parts that are installed in F-15s
and F-16s from Japan to the United States, Japan has
affirmed since July 2014 that these overseas transfers fall
under cases that may be permitted, based on deliberations
at the National Security Council.

**2 Production, Sustainment and Maintenance**
**of Common Equipment between Japan and**
**the United States**


**Chapter**


**(1) Participation of Japanese Industry in the**
**Production of the F-35A fighter aircraft and the**
**Establishment of Regional Maintenance, Repair,**
**Overhaul and Upgrade (MRO&U) Capability**

In December 2011, Japan selected the F-35A fighter
aircraft to be the successor to the F-4 fighter aircraft.
At the same time, the Government decided to procure
42 aircraft from FY2012 onwards and to have Japanese
industries participate in its production, aside from several
completed aircraft, which will be imported.[2] In light of
this decision, the Japanese Government has been working
to enable the involvement of Japanese industries in the
manufacturing process in preparation for the acquisition
of F-35A fighter aircraft from FY2013 onwards. So
far the Japanese companies have participated in the
Final Assembly and Check Out (FACO) for airframe
and engines, and the manufacture of some engine parts
(19 items), radar parts (7 items), and Electro-Optical
Distributed Aperture System (EODAS)[3] parts (3 items).


In December 2018, the number of F-35A fighter aircraft to be procured was changed from 42 to 147, of which 42 can be replaced by fighters that are capable of short take-off and vertical landing (STOVL).

EODAS; comprising six built-in cutting-edge infrared sensors per aircraft, realizes 360-degree spherical situational awareness, and enables missile detection and tracking.

In December 2019, for F-35A fighter aircraft procurement in FY2019 and FY2020, and in December 2020, for F-35A fighter procurement in FY2021, it was decided to choose manufacturing
arrangements involving domestic companies as it was confirmed to be more cost effective.

regional demands for repair.[6]
Mitsubishi Heavy Industries’ Komaki South Plant,
located in Aichi Prefecture, began operating as the
regional MRO&U for the F-35 fighter airframe in July
2020. Establishing a maintenance depot for airframes,
engines and others within Japan, and contributing to
maintenance in the Asia-Pacific region are significant
from the perspectives of securing the operational support
system for F-35A fighter aircraft in Japan, maintaining
the Japanese defense industrial base, strengthening
the Japan-U.S. Alliance, and deepening equipment
cooperation in the Indo-Pacific region.

**(2) Initiatives towards the Establishment of the**
**Common Maintenance Base for Ospreys of Japan**
**and the U.S.**

As the Planned Maintenance Interval (PMI) of the U.S.
Marine Corps Ospreys deployed at Marine Corps Air
Station Futenma was scheduled to commence roughly in
2017, the U.S. Navy carried out a public tender to select
a maintenance company. Fuji Heavy Industries Ltd.[7] was
selected as the maintenance company for this purpose in


October 2015. From February 2017, the PMI has been
performed at GSDF Camp Kisarazu. Maintenance of the
first aircraft was completed in March 2019, the second
in March 2020, and the third in January 2021, and the
aircraft were delivered to the U.S. Forces. The fourth and
fifth aircraft are currently under maintenance.
The MOD intends to establish a common maintenance
base for both Japan’s and the United States’ Osprey by
allowing the maintenance company to use the hangar at
GSDF Camp Kisarazu for aircraft maintenance of the
U.S. Marine Corps Osprey and also to implement the
future aircraft maintenance of the GSDF Osprey at the
same camp from the following perspectives: (1) smooth
introduction of the GSDF Osprey (V-22);[8] (2) smooth
and effective operation of the Japan-U.S. security
arrangements; and (3) enhanced efficiency in maintenance.
The establishment of a common maintenance base at
GSDF Camp Kisarazu would be extremely significant
in that it will contribute to mitigating the burden on
Okinawa as well as the “Strengthening of the basis to
repair and maintain common equipment” stated in the
new Guidelines.

**3** **Building New Defense Equipment and Technology Cooperation**

Also, the Japan-U.K. Cooperative Research Project

**1 Defense Equipment and Technology Cooperation**

Research on Personnel Vulnerability Evaluation (from
July 2016 to July 2020) and the Cooperative Research on
the Certification Process of Jet Engines (from February
2018 to February 2020) were all completed successfully.
The Cooperative Research on the Feasibility of a Japan
and Great Britain Universal Advanced RF System
(JAGUAR) and the Japan-U.K. Cooperative Research
Project on the Demonstration of a Joint New Air-toair Missile were launched respectively in March and
December 2018, and are currently in progress.
Furthermore, the two countries have been exchanging
information regarding the F-X fighter and the Future
Combat Air System (FCAS),[10] which are under study by
the two countries respectively, such as the Joint Preliminary
Study on Potential Collaborative Opportunities for FCAS/
Future Fighter. They involve exchanging views on the
potential for future collaboration about these topics
between not only the governments but also industries.


**Chapter**


Defense equipment and technology cooperation with
major European countries, which have competitive
defense industries, will contribute to the strengthening of
security and defense cooperation with these countries as
well as the maintenance and strengthening of the defense
industrial base in Japan. Therefore, Japan seeks to
establish and deepen relationships with these countries.

**(1) The United Kingdom**
In July 2013, Japan and the U.K. signed the Agreement
concerning the Transfer of Defense Equipment and
Technology[9] and it went into effect. In the same
month, the two countries also started the Chemical and
Biological Protection Technology Cooperative Research
Project, which is the first time for Japan to engage in such
bilateral research except for ones with the United States.
The Cooperative Research was completed successfully in
July 2017.


The regional MRO&U for avionics components in Japan is planned to be developed by Mitsubishi Electric Corporation (Kamakura Works in Kanagawa Prefecture)

The company was renamed SUBARU Corporation on April 1, 2017.

GSDF will introduce 17 tilt-rotor aircraft (Osprey (V-22)) that can complement and strengthen the capabilities of transport helicopters (CH-47JA) in terms of cruising speed and range. As a temporary
measure until completion of the maintenance facilities in Saga Airport, the aircraft will be temporarily deployed at Camp Kisarazu.

Japan and ASEAN member states have exchanged views
regarding defense equipment and technology cooperation
in non-traditional security sectors, such as humanitarian
assistance, disaster relief, and maritime security, through
the Japan-ASEAN Defense Vice-Ministerial Meetings
and other occasions. Participating countries have
expressed their expectation for Japan’s cooperation in
effectively dealing with these issues. In the “Vientiane
Vision” announced by Japan at the ASEAN-Japan
Defence Ministers’ Informal Meeting held in November
2016, it is stated that Japan’s defense equipment and
technology cooperation with ASEAN countries would
be promoted with a focus on the following three points:
(1) equipment and technology transfer, (2) human
resources development, and (3) holding seminars on
defense industries.
As a specific initiative, Japan and the Philippines
made an official agreement on the transfer of MSDF’s
TC- 90 training aircraft to the Philippine Navy at the
Japan-Philippines summit meeting in September 2016.

the Armed Forces of the Philippines. In the field of defense
equipment, Japan has previously transferred the MSDF TC-90
aircraft and GSDF UH-1H parts to the Philippines. The transfer
of a complete set of newly-made air defense radar systems is
expected to further deepen the bilateral relationship between
Japan and the Philippines beyond the area of national security.
Furthermore, I sincerely hope that the transfer will contribute
not only to the enhancement of air defense capabilities for the
Philippines but also to the nation’s regional security.
Looking back on the lessons learned through this endeavor,
I would stress the importance of people, including those from
embassies, in particular defense attachés and officers of each
country, and industrial enterprises. By paying sincere attention
to our partner’s needs, and engaging with enthusiasm to The author (right) being greeted by the honor guard of the Philippine Air Force

and speed of airborne subjects. Based on the requirements of
the Philippine Air Force and leveraging on our experience in
manufacturing various radars for the Japan Self-Defense Forces,
we will manufacture an improved and modernized version of
our radar for the overseas market. The radars will serve as an
essential asset for enhancing the air defense capabilities of the
Philippines and ensure regional peace and stability.
For a Japanese company with no previous experience in
the international defense market, we faced tough competition
against well-established foreign manufacturers. Our sales
and engineering teams worked tirelessly to understand and
fulfil the specific requirements of the Philippine Air Force and
ultimately gained their confidence and approval.
When we started, we were unfamiliar with the Philippines’
procurement system and process, and had to conduct
extensive research. It was a long journey with many obstacles,
but with diligence, perseverance and timely responses to the

This project is a first for both countries. For the Philippines,
it is the first procurement of defense equipment from Japan,
while it is Japan’s first export of military hardware to a
foreign government. The ASRS is projected to bolster the
AFP’s maritime domain awareness (MDA) and air defense
capabilities essential for the Philippines’ defense posture.
The ASRS project notably builds upon the momentum
of defense engagement between the two countries in
several other areas, which was made possible by the 2015
Memorandum on Defense Cooperation and Exchanges
between the Philippines’ Department of National Defense
(DND) and Japan’s Ministry of Defense (MOD). Along with other

Regarding the transfer, it was confirmed at the JapanPhilippines Defence Ministerial Meeting in June 2018 that
parts and maintenance equipment of the UH-1H utility
helicopters that became unnecessary for the GSDF would
also be granted to the Philippine Air Force. After the
signing of an arrangement between the defense officials
involved in the transfer in November 2018, delivery
of some components started in March 2019 and was
completed in September 2019. These two transfers were
cases of the application of the provision of the SDF Act
enforced in June 2017 that enables the MOD to grant or
transfer the equipment which is decommissioned by the
SDF to the governments of developing states for a lower
price than the current price (See Paragraph 3 below).
Further, in January 2019, a framework was
established for regular consultations of the Joint
Working Group on Defense Equipment and Technology
Cooperation. In August 2020, a contract was concluded
between the Department of National Defense of the
Philippines and Mitsubishi Electric Corporation, Inc.,
who would supply four air surveillance radar systems
for approximately US$100 million. This was the first
case of overseas transfer of finished equipment since the
2014 establishment of the Three Principles on Transfer
of Defense Equipment and Technology.
In November 2017, Japan and Thailand agreed to promote


future defense equipment and technology cooperation,
including early conclusion of the Agreement concerning the
Transfer of Defense Equipment and Technology.
Japan and Vietnam signed the Terms of Reference
(TOR) for regular consultations concerning defense
equipment and technological cooperation at the JapanVietnam Defense Vice-Ministerial Level Meeting in
November 2016. Concerning the specific fields of
cooperation, the Memorandum on the Orientation of
Promotion of Defense Industry Cooperation was signed
during the Japan-Vietnam Defense Ministers’ Meeting
in May 2019. In addition, at the Japan-Vietnam summit
meeting held in October 2020, the leaders reached
consensus in principle on the Agreement concerning the
Transfer of Defense Equipment and Technology.
Additionally, the MOD held the Vietnam webinar on
the overseas transfer of defense equipment in March 2021

the Hashemite Kingdom of Jordan, in August 2019,
Japan lent a retired GSDF Type-61 main battle tank
without charge to Jordan for display at the Royal Tank
Museum. Meanwhile, the King offered to donate an
armored vehicle developed in Jordan to the Japanese
GSDF and the GSDF received the vehicle in the
same month. In October 2019, both countries held a
ceremony for the lending and donation at the MOD. At
the ceremony our Minister of Defense and Jordanian

2019 for appropriate protection of such classified
information provided between Japanese and Israeli
defense authorities.


**3 Establishment of Regulations on Equipment**
**Cooperation with Developing Countries**

Surrounded by an increasingly severe security
environment, it has become even more important for
Japan that the nations which have a cooperative and
friendly relationship with Japan in terms of security and
defense have appropriate capabilities. It is also critical to
develop a foundation that will serve as the basis for the
international community to cooperate towards improving
the security environment.
Among these friendly nations, some have difficulties in
acquiring an adequate level of defense equipment on their
own because of their economic and fiscal situations. Some
of these states are requesting to use SDF’s equipment
which is no longer used. However, Article 9, paragraph (1)
of the Public Finance Act[20] stipulates that the Government
must receive reasonable consideration when transferring
or leasing any governmental properties including the
SDF’s equipment to other countries. Therefore, a grant
or a transfer at a lower price than the current price is not
allowed except when permitted by law.
Under these circumstances, to respond to the needs
of such friendly nations, the MOD established a special
provision of Article 9, paragraph (1) of the Public Finance
Act in the SDF Act and it went into force in June 2017. The
proivision enables the MOD to grant or transfer the SDF’s
equipment which is no longer used to the governments of
developing states at a lower price than the current price.
Even in the case of granting or transferring equipment
at a lower price than the current price as per this provision,
whether or not to transfer such equipment, and to which
government such equipment is to be transferred, will be
determined case-by-case in light of the Three Principles
on Transfer of Defense Equipment and Technology and
other regulations. In addition, the Government of Japan
and partner countries must conclude an international
agreement to prevent extra-purpose use and transfer to
third-parties without the prior consent of Japan.[21]

the MOD has been considering the civilian use of aircraft
that it has developed.
In August 2010, the MOD compiled a set of guidelines
for the development of a concrete system for the civilian
use of aircraft, while in 2011, it also developed an
application procedure for private companies interested in
civilian use. So far, technical data related to the civilian
use of the US-2 amphibian rescue aircraft and the F7-10
engine that are mounted on P-1 maritime patrol aircraft
have been disclosed in response to requests from the
implementing companies. In December 2016, the ATLA
and IHI Corporation, a company manufacturing the F710 engine, signed a contract for the civilian use of the F710 engine for sales to the Japan Aerospace Exploration

**2** **Initiatives towards Enhancing Intelligence Capabilities**

FY2019 and beyond (NDPG), in order to provide timely
and effective intelligence support to policy decision and
SDF operations, the MOD/SDF will promote initiatives
to comprehensively enhance intelligence capabilities at
all stages of intelligence, including gathering, analyzing,
sharing and securing of information.
Specifically, the MOD/SDF is strengthening information
gathering and analysis capabilities so that the MOD/
SDF will be fully capable of meeting various intelligence
requirements including those related to new domains. This
is being conducted by strengthening gathering postures for
SIGINT and IMINT through establishing and enhancing
capabilities of information collection facilities, utilizing
IGS and commercial satellites, and diversifying means
for information collection through new equipment such
as long-endurance Unmanned Aircraft Vehicles (UAVs).
Furthermore, the MOD/SDF is also strengthening the
gathering posture of HUMINT through enhancing its
defense attaché system, reinforcing the gathering posture of
OSINT and expanding its cooperation with allied countries.
In this regard, the MOD/SDF proactively utilizes the
latest information processing technology, promotes allsource analysis by fusing a wide variety of information

sources together, and successfully develops and connects
systems that promote information sharing. In order
to respond appropriately to increasingly diversified
intelligence requirements, the MOD/SDF is promoting the
securing and training of highly capable personnel handling
information collection and analysis. Moreover, the MOD/
SDF is taking steady measures in various directions
including recruitment, education, training, and personnel
allocation to strengthen comprehensive information
collection and analysis capabilities.
With regard to information security, the MOD/SDF will
coordinate with relevant offices to make every effort by
such means as education in ensuring information sharing
on a need-to-know basis, and in taking preventive measures
against information leakage. Also, the MOD/SDF will
strengthen counter-intelligence capability within the MOD/
SDF by promoting collaboration with relevant organizations.
In addition, the Senior Coordinator for Intelligence
on Economic Security was established in the Defense
Intelligence Division, Bureau of Defense Policy in
FY2021 to establish the institutional framework to assume
responsibility for both “gathering and analyzing” and
“securing” all kinds of information concerning economic
security including advanced technologies.

Specifically, they conduct comprehensive analysis on
international situations that change day by day from diverse
perspectives, including military, political and economic
factors, based on information received from a wide range
of sources including SIGINT, IMINT, OSINT (newspapers,
internet, etc.) and opinion exchange with relevant parties.
The Defense Intelligence Headquarters is also
strengthening information gathering and analyzing functions
in new areas such as space, cyber, and the electromagnetic
spectrum. For example, it conducts the collection and
analysis of necessary information regarding threats in
cyberspace through such means as collecting OSINT and
exchanging information with other countries.
Results of the Defense Intelligence Headquarters’

The Maritime Self-Defense Force (MSDF) uses a
training system that enhances proficiency in stages,
as a specific period that takes account of the timing of
crewmember rotations and naval vessel inspections and
repairs is determined as the cycle, which is then divided
into multiple stages.
In the early stages of training under this system, a
transition occurs to applied unit training in accordance with
the enhancement of the proficiency with naval vessels and
aircraft, which are the basic units of fighting capability, and
collaborative training between naval vessels and between
naval vessels and aircraft is conducted.


**4 Joint Training**

To fully exert Japan’s defense capability during
contingencies, it is necessary to gain experience in
joint operations of the Ground, Maritime, and Air SelfDefense Forces on a steady-state basis. Because of
this, the SDF conducts joint training, in which two or
more branches of the SDF cooperate, and is working to
augment it.
Joint training can be divided into joint function

**Cooperation with Re-employment Support**

Amid the harsh recruitment and employment situation,
the cooperation from local governments and relevant
organizations is vital to secure highly qualified personnel
and to support the re-employment of uniformed SDF
personnel who retire at relatively young ages.

**(2) Support for and Cooperation with SDF Activities**
The SDF camps and bases maintain close relations
with regional society, and therefore, various forms of


support and cooperation from the local community are
indispensable for the SDF to conduct its diverse activities,
including education and training, and disaster relief.
Moreover, units dispatched overseas for international
peace cooperation operations and other duties receive
support and cooperation from the relevant organizations
for the procedures involved.
The MOD/SDF are further strengthening cooperation
with relevant entities such as local governments, police
and fire services in order to ensure immediate and sure
activities by the SDF in various contingencies.

**3** **Activities for Securing Understanding and Cooperation of Municipal Governments**
**and Local Residents**


Also, the bureaus conducted liaison and coordination
with local governments in response to typhoon, heavy
rain and other disasters. They also implemented
measures to promote understanding of the defense policy
in general by providing all prefectures and municipalities
with explanations on the Defense White Paper and also
by holding the first online seminars on defense issues in
light of the COVID-19 crisis among other things.

See Fig. IV-5-1-1 (Work to Develop Regional Cooperation)


Regional Defense Bureaus established in eight
locations nationwide make efforts to build cooperative
relationships with their respective local communities,
through collaboration with SDF units and Provincial
Cooperation Offices. In FY2020 the bureaus provided
local communities with explanations on a variety
of training including Japan-U.S. bilateral training,
development of SDF facilities on Mageshima, and plan
to deploy Ground Self-Defense Force (GSDF) V-22

**4** **Measures to Promote Harmony between Defense Facilities and Surrounding Areas**

Taking into consideration the requests from the relevant

**the Surrounding Areas**

review to enable the Specified Defense Facilities Environs

Improvement Adjustment Grants to be applied to socalled soft projects, such as aid for medical expenses. In
addition, the MOD added defense facilities to be eligible
for these grants. Focused work is also underway to provide
soundproofing for housing.
Regarding the Specified Defense Facilities Environs
Improvement Adjustment Grants, the MOD has
implemented initiatives such as the PDCA Cycle process
since April 2014, aiming to increase the effectiveness of
these grants.
In response to the requests by the relevant local
governments, the MOD continues to study how the
measures to harmonize defense facilities and surrounding
areas should be in an attempt to make them more suitable,
effective and efficient, in consideration of the severe
fiscal situation.

Reference 59 (List of U.S. Forces Japan Facilities/Areas [including


Defense facilities are diverse in their use, and often require
large volumes of land. In addition, as of January 1, 2021,
approximately 29% of the land area and 30 of the 78
facilities and areas (for exclusive use) of the USFJ are
jointly used by the SDF in accordance with the Japan-U.S.
Status of Forces Agreement, with the purpose to enhance
the diversity and efficiency of Japan-U.S. bilateral training
and exercises. Meanwhile, problems related to restricted
establishment and operations of defense facilities have
emerged due to the urbanization of areas around many of
the defense facilities. Also, another problem is that frequent
aircraft operations such as takeoffs and landings cause
noise and other issues, impacting the living environment
of local residential communities.
With that being said, defense facilities, as the
foundation that supports the defense capabilities of
Japan and the Japan- U.S. Security Arrangements, are
indispensable for our country’s security. Therefore, in
order for the facilities to exert their full function, it is
necessary to maintain conditions for constant and stable
utilization by ensuring harmony between the defense
facilities and the surrounding areas as well as obtaining
the understanding and cooperation of the local residents.
For that purpose, the MOD has taken measures to
prevent, reduce or mitigate aircraft noise and other
impacts caused by activities of the SDF or the USFJ, or
by the establishment/operations of airfields and other
defense facilities in the surrounding areas since 1974
based on the Act on Improvement of Living Environment

**2 Efforts to Develop Understanding and**
**Cooperation Concerning the Stationing of**
**the USFJ**

Amid the increasingly severe security environment
surrounding Japan, maintaining the presence of the USFJ
and its readiness is vitally important for ensuring the
security of Japan.
For stable stationing of the USFJ, it is essential to
obtain the understanding and cooperation of the local
governments and residents in the vicinities of defense
facilities.
For this purpose, the MOD will work to share this
recognition with the United States at various levels
including the Japan-U.S. Defense Ministerial Meeting.
The ministry will also constantly take various measures,
including coordination for unit operation of the USFJ


**(2) Grants, etc., to Promote the USFJ Realignment**
During a period of time before and after the implementation
of the USFJ realignment[5] (10 years in principle),
realignment grants[6] are provided to help to cover the
expenses of projects,[7] which contribute to improving the
convenience of the residents’ lives in local municipalities
affected by the realignment, and to stimulate the local
industries. These grants are provided in accordance
with the progress of the realignment, after the Defense
Minister designates the specified defense facilities and
neighboring municipalities affected by the realignment.
As of April 2021, 14 municipalities for nine defense
facilities are eligible to receive the realignment grants.


Approximately 4.8 billion yen in the FY2021 budget

Under the Act on Special Measures for Smooth Implementation of the Realignment of the United States Forces in Japan, changes in the composition of naval fleets (replacement of the aircraft carrier,
at Commander Fleet Activities Yokosuka, with a nuclear aircraft carrier) that integrally operate with air wings subject to the realignment are treated in the same way as the realignment.

As stipulated in Article 2 of the Enforcement Ordinance of the Act on Special Measures for Smooth Implementation of the Realignment of the United States Forces in Japan, there are 14 specific


-----

In order to promote the realignment, additional measures
are taken with budgetary provision.

See Reference 60 (Outline of Measures to Promote Harmony

See

Between Defense Facilities and Surrounding Areas)

**(3) Ensuring Safety of Operations of the USFJ**
Ensuring the safety of local residents is of prime
importance in USFJ operations, and no accident or
incident must occur.
In the event of a crash, component fall/loss,
precautionary landing on civilian airports,[8] etc., of U.S.
Forces aircraft, the MOD urges the United States to
make exhaustive measures for safety management and
recurrence prevention as well as prompt information
provision. The ministry also requests measures such as
suspension of flying according to the individual case. The
MOD promptly provides the relevant local governments,
etc., with explanation of the obtained information and takes
measures to ensure prompt and appropriate compensation
for the damage caused by the incident or accident.
The MOD not only listens to the results of accident
investigation and recurrence prevention measures of the
United States but also uses expert knowledge of the SDF
to determine their reasonableness.
Furthermore, in July 2019, another effort was made
by revising the guidelines concerning aircraft accidents
in order to further refine the applicable policies and
procedures in case of an accident caused by U.S. military
aircraft accidents outside of U.S. Forces facilities and
areas in Japan.
Considering anxiety and concerns among local
residents, Japan has been fully communicating its
approach to the U.S. side including at the top and
ministerial levels. The two countries closely cooperate to
secure safe operation as the top priority.
The MOD is also concerned about the increasing trend
of accidents/incidents due to drinking caused by U.S.
Forces military personnel and others and has requested
the U.S. side on multiple occasions to reinforce official
discipline and personnel education.
The United States has also taken measures for its part,
putting in place its guidelines for off-duty action (liberty
policy), including measures such as alcohol restrictions
at nighttime as well as curfews applying to U.S. Forces
personnel ranked below a certain rank. Both the countries
will continue cooperation to prevent recurrence of
incidents related to drinking.
In addition, the Government of Japan prepared Crime
Prevention Measures in Okinawa in June 2016 to deter
crime in Okinawa Prefecture and ensure the safety and
security of the people of Okinawa. Bolstering crime


prevention patrol operations and establishing a safe and
secure environment are the pillars of the Measures.
The MOD is participating in the Okinawa Local
Safety Patrol Corps established in the Okinawa General
Bureau and will continue to cooperate with the relevant
ministries and agencies to make it an effective crimeprevention effort.

**(4) Promoting Exchange between the USFJ and Local**
**Residents**

The MOD holds a Japan-U.S. exchange program to
deepen mutual understanding between Japan and the
United States with the understanding and cooperation
of the local governments and USFJ. Under the program,
residents living near USFJ facilities and areas together
with USFJ personnel enjoy sports, music and cultural
exchanges.
The USFJ also has initiatives to deepen mutual
understanding with people of the local communities,
which include opening up of its bases (Friendship
day) and information provision through websites and
social media.


**(5) Other Measures (Including Measures Pertaining to**
**the SDF)**

(1) Compensation for Fisheries
The MOD defines the confined water for training, etc.
carried out by the SDF or the USFJ using water surface
based on laws (Article 105-1 of the Self-Defense Forces
Law or Article 1 of the Act to Restrict the Operation of
Fishing Boats) or a contract and compensates for losses
incurred from the restriction.
As an administrative measure to help people who
suffered losses in their fishery operation due to the
restriction or prohibition based on the provisions of
the acts but cannot receive compensation under the
provisions of the acts, the MOD provides relief money to
people who satisfy certain requirements.
(2) Base Subsidy, etc.
The MOD provides cooperation by doing such things
as providing various information also for the subsidy
for municipalities where national defense facilities are
located (“Base Subsidy”), and the Adjustment Grants
for municipalities where defense facilities are located
(“Adjustment Grants”), both of which are under the
defense facilities-related subsidy system under the
jurisdiction of the Ministry of Internal Affairs and
Communications.
The base subsidy has been established considering
that, among the facilities of the U.S. forces or the
facilities used by the SDF, the land used for airports and

Committee on the 2020 Tokyo Summer Olympics and
Paralympics led by the Minister of Defense was set up in
September 2013.
At the first committee meeting, then Defense Minister
Onodera explained the significance of the cooperation
and participation of the MOD/SDF and stated that SDF
personnel would make full efforts for Japan’s security
and work for successful games with the spirit that all SDF
members were participants.
At the 12th committee meeting in December 2019,
it was decided that the MOD/SDF would take security
measures, including warning and surveillance of the

Cases of interference by laser irradiation and kite
flying against the SDF and U.S. Forces aircraft in flight
have been occurring frequently. These are extremely
dangerous and malicious acts that may disrupt a pilot’s
ability to operate aircraft and result in a catastrophe
such as a crash. Therefore, the MOD disseminates
information regarding the risks involved in these acts
to local residents by putting up posters and requests
their cooperation in reporting to the police while
closely cooperating with relevant local governments.
Additionally, the Ordinance for Enforcement of the
Civil Aeronautics Act was revised in December 2016,
making these interference acts subject to regulation as
well as fines and other penalties.


Approximately 50 GSDF personnel worked approximately

**Facilities**

In accordance with a statement by the National Security
Strategy, established in December 2013, that Japan will
review issues related to the use of land in areas such
as areas surrounding defense facilities from a national
security viewpoint, the MOD has, since FY2013, been
conducting research to secure a systematic understanding
of the situation of land ownership in areas surrounding
defense facilities. On July 17, 2020, the Government of
Japan issued the Basic Policy on Economic and Fiscal
Management and Reform 2020 by Cabinet Decision,
where it was stated that “from the standpoint of national

In recent years there have been terror attacks overseas
(including attempted ones) using small drones, including
commercial drones, some of which are targeted at military
facilities. Given such a situation, there is a concern that
drone terror attacks on the SDF/USFJ facilities and
areas can also happen in Japan, and if these facilities
are endangered, the function as foundations to defend
our nation can be seriously affected. To address such a
concern, the Act on Prohibition of Flight of UASs around
and over Key Facilities commonly known as the “Drone
Act” was enforced on June 13, 2019, to prohibit small
drones from flying over the SDF/USFJ facilities and

string of issues surrounding PFOS and progress is
being made on such efforts as setting provisional target
values for tap water and water environments and the
rapid replacement and disposal of aqueous film-forming
foam in the possession of the SDF and firefighters.
Furthermore, the Japan and U.S. governments are
cooperating on and studying with focus the replacement
of aqueous film-forming foam in the possession of USFJ
and other matters. MOD/SDF will continue to cooperate
closely with the relevant ministries and agencies, related
local governments, and the U.S. side in order to dispel the
concerns of the local residents

The MSDF carries on an Imperial Navy tradition as
their signature dish: the SDF Curry. The delicious curry,
whose recipe is a secret, is served at lunch every Friday
on MSDF vessels to the personnel on board. The recipe
is shared with restaurants and diners in the vicinity of
the MSDF bases, and the curry is promoted as a local
signature dish by the community as a whole.
The “secret” recipe is also accessible on the MSDF
website.
Since 2018, the ASDF has been publicizing a
Japanese-style fried-chicken dish called “Ku-ji Karaage” as its signature menu, together with its mascot,
“Karatto-Taicho.” The name, “Ku-ji Kara-age” literally
means “ASDF fried chicken,” and comes with the wish
to aim higher, and in addition to being very nutritious
and rich in protein, it is very affordable and easy to cook.
The recipe of each base in Japan is available to the
public on the ASDF website A series of short videos on

Democracy, which is the most important system of

appropriate judgment and exercise of sovereignty.
Administrative documents held by the government
are of the utmost importance for the public’s access to
accurate information. For this reason it is an important
responsibility for the government, including the MOD/
SDF, to manage information in an appropriate manner
and appropriately respond to the public’s information
disclosure requests.
