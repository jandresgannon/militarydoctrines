### A new era,new requirements,new missions

We are living in a global era. We are part of an open and rapidly changing global
society. A society with great opportunities, facing many challenges.
A society faced with a new security agenda. An era entailing new missions for the
Norwegian Armed Forces.

Security and the development of a well functioning international community based
on human rights and global concerted efforts, are the fundamental premises that
underpin our society. Norwegian Defence must be capable of meeting the security
challenges that face our country in these times. We must have the ability to protect
our security interests in Norway and the neighbouring areas. We must participate in
the fight against terrorism, and contribute towards reconstruction, peace and
stability in countries devastated by war and conflict. This implies a need for flexible,
high quality defence forces capable of rapid reaction when required.

The Government’s new Proposition to Parliament, setting out the Long-Term Plan
for the Armed Forces (2005 - 2008), proposes new solutions and new guidelines for
the further development of our Armed Forces, in order to make them more capable
of meeting future challenges and accomplish new missions. A defence organisation
capable of rapid reaction. A defence establishment oriented toward the challenges
of our times. Armed Forces that are both modern and flexible.

My vision for the Armed Forces is an organisation that can accomplish these
missions. A learning organisation – capable of new thinking, a living organisation –
capable of adapting, and an organisation capable of playing a significant role in
NATO. Armed Forces, moreover, that can deliver the forces that are needed.
The purpose of the restructuring of the Armed Forces over the last two years has
been to lay the foundations for this overall capability. And we shall continue to
follow this course.

The Long-Term Plan carries forward the modernisation of our military units and
materiel. The aim is greater efficiency and flexibility with the capability to adapt
continuously to changing threats and challenges. This will improve the capability
of the Armed Forces to carry out their missions – nationally, in the context of the
UN and within the NATO alliance.

To achieve this we need personnel who are well qualified and well motivated,
and with the right attitude. We must take good care of our personnel. I am proud
of the determination and commitment shown by our men and women. It promises
well for the future of Norwegian Defence.

The Government’s new Long-Term Plan aims to create modern armed forces which,
either alone or in concert with allies, can meet new threats and contribute
constructively towards making the world, both here at home and in a wider context,
a safer place in which to live. This will give us a true Defence for our time.

## Modernisation continues Transformation:Military change


In the context of long-term defence
planning and organisational
restructuring, transformation means
placing increased emphasis on the
ability of the Armed Forces to remain
flexible and adaptable.
To achieve this aim, our defence
structure, including the Armed Forces,
must embody both the will and the
ability to change and adapt.

#### We must have an adaptive defence structure


jointly, both nationally and internationally.

The figure below illustrates the linkage
and interplay between the four core
aspects of transformation: doctrines,
lessons learned, technology development, research and experimentation.
Transformation, however, depends
above all on people and on professional
competence. Creativity, the will and the
ability to embrace change, combined
with solid professional competence,
are the qualities needed in service
personnel and these will be crucial to
the continuing modernisation of the
Armed Forces.


Transformation implies reshaping or a
process of qualitative change. Military
transformation entails changing the
composition or attributes of military
forces, or the way in which they
operate. The aim of military
transformation is to create a defence
organisation which is better able to
manage unpredictability and the broad
spectrum of defence tasks.
Transformation is thus a proactive
and continuing process in which novel
concepts, doctrines and capabilities are
developed and integrated to improve
the effectiveness and efficiency of
armed forces. Military transformation
will enhance their ability to operate

###### The Transformation Wheel


**The Long-Term Plan 2005-2008 carries**
**forward the modernisation of the**
**Armed Forces through:**

- increasing the operational capability
of the Armed Forces and the
proportion of usable forces with
a rapid reaction capability

- establishing a usable, and deployable
army brigade, Brigade North

- establishing a joint, usable and
deployable ISTAR capability for
surveillance, intelligence, target
acquisition and reconnaissance,
including unmanned aerial vehicles
(UAV)



- increasing the scope of the capabilities that the Armed Forces contribute
to national and international crisis
management operations

- proposing a quality reform for the
Home Guard involving better
equipment, training and organisation
coupled with greater task-based
specialisation

- strengthening the Navy through the
phasing in of new surface vessels,
and new helicopters for the frigates
and Coast Guard vessels


**This will be achieved by measures**
**including the following:**

- improving personnel administration
throughout the Armed Forces to
reflect the new threats and
challenges and to meet the armed
services’ need for personnel with
specialized qualities and skills

- continuing the policy of conscription
adapted to meet the needs of the
Armed Forces

- creating a more efficient support and
logistics concept matched to
operational needs

- reallocating NOK 2 billion from
logistics and support functions to
materiel investments and operational
activities

## Modern armed forces – an answer to a changing strategic setting

###### NORWAY AND ITS NEIGHBOURING REGIONS


**Norwegian security is closely linked**
**with international security**
Norway’s security can only be assured
within a framework of international
cooperation in which the UN forms the
keystone. The UN plays a key role in
Norwegian security policy. For Norway,
therefore, it is a matter of high priority
to support and strengthen the role of
the UN. The UN has, in the light of
experience gained during the 1990s,
expanded its concept of peace operations. The report of the UN’s Secretary
General “Agenda for Peace” from 1992
provided a major contribution to the


events, even when they are taking place
in distant parts of the world, can have
consequences for our everyday life and
our security here at home.
The security environment is also fraught
with uncertainty. In the past our defence
planning was focused largely on threats
from other countries. Any attack would
have entailed substantial preparations,
such as force build-up and troop movements on the part of an aggressor, so
allowing time for defensive measures
to be taken.
Today the possibility of crises and
minor conflicts arising with little or no
previous warning is much more a
reality. International terrorism takes
advantage of the vulnerability of modern
society, modern technology and infrastructure when planning and carrying
out attacks. The possibility that we, or
our allies, may be subjected to attack by
weapons of mass destruction is a real
one. States which collapse and degenerate into internal conflict provide fertile
ground for extreme political groupings
and widespread human suffering.


The purpose of Norway’s security
policy is to safeguard and promote
national security interests, first and
foremost the safety and wellbeing of
the Norwegian people. The Norwegian
economy is, to a considerable extent,
dependent on natural resources in the
northern sea areas and is affected by
international developments in the oil
and energy sector. In its immediate
neighbourhood, Norway must demonstrate that it has the will and the ability
to exercise its own sovereignty, as well
as being capable of managing national
crises and incidents. Norwegian
defence planning must also take into
account the threat from international
terrorism and weapons of mass
destruction. Because crises and
incidents in the future are likely to
occur more suddenly than in the past,
and in ways and locations that cannot
be predicted or planned for, we need
defence resources of a new kind.
The need to be capable of dealing with
the unexpected, especially on or close
to our home territory, makes it vital


that we have defence forces capable of
countering or minimising such threats.
Priority must therefore be given to flexible, rapid reaction forces of high quality.

**Globalisation and unpredictability**
Our times are characterised by increasing interdependence between countries
and regions. Geographical distances
have less significance. The effects of
globalisation are to a large extent
positive. It has contributed to important
advances, not only in technological and
economic terms but also politically and
culturally. Mutual dependence and
understanding extending across
national boundaries are probably the
most important factors in building
stability and peaceful coexistence.
At the same time, globalisation has
brought a number of new challenges,
not least in the field of security. In some
countries and regions these developments have contributed to undermining
traditional social structures and many
countries are afflicted by civil war and
internal unrest. Such conflicts and


debate, which continued over several
years, as to how such operations
should be carried out, and the kind of
forces that should be employed. The
“Brahimi Report”, produced in the year
2000 by a UN expert panel, concluded
that the traditional concept of peacekeeping operations should be expanded
and that the UN needed more robust
forces, capable of exerting a deterrent
effect, if the UN was to be more than a
powerless observer in the event of
breaches of human rights, ethnic
cleansing or other breaches of international law or agreements.


The UN has also supported, to an
increasing extent, the use of regional
organisations, such as NATO, to carry
out peace operations. This ensures that
operations are properly mandated
under the provisions of international
law, while freeing the UN from direct
operational responsibility for the conduct of operations for which the organisation would not itself have the requisite resources or command structure.
NATO will continue to constitute the
cornerstone of Norwegian security
within the overall framework provided
by the UN. Multinational solutions will

###### THE ORGANISATION AND TASKS OF NORWEGIAN DEFENCE


**The Armed Forces are to be**
**developed as a modern, flexible**
**and alliance-oriented instru-**
**ment of security policy in which**
**every effort will be made to**
**ensure that a balance is struck**
**between defence tasks, organi-**
**sational structure and resource**
**allocation. Defence activities will**
**be based on close cooperation**
**with relevant civil authorities**
**and a system of National Service**
**adapted to the needs of the**
**Armed Forces. The focus will be**
**on the safeguarding and promo-**
**tion of Norwegian interests**
**based on the capacity to meet a**
**broad spectrum of challenges,**
**both at home and abroad.**


Norwegian defence must be organised
so that it is able, in the best way
possible, to handle the sum total of
the most central challenges and tasks
generated by the security environment.
The solution is a modern, flexible and
alliance-oriented defence, in which
tasks, structure and resource allocations are in balance. Such a defence
must feature forces that are available at
short notice and which can be deployed
wherever and whenever the need arises,
at home or abroad, either alone or in
concert with others.


**Civil-military cooperation**
In order to be able to counter new
security challenges, in particular the
growth in international terrorism,
cooperation between military and civil
authorities needs to be developed
further. The concept of Total Defence
must be adapted to meet these new
demands. Effective civil-military cooperation will in future depend on the
Armed Forces and the civil authorities
providing mutual support across the
whole spectrum of incidents and crises.


however, technological advances bring
new vulnerabilities and new challenges.
The danger posed by the the spread of
weapons of mass destruction and
modern weapon technology are central
aspects of this. Advances in technology
offer new ways to attack the structure of
society, or to strike a military aggressor,
and these advances have contributed to
the increased potential threat posed by
international terrorism.

Today the changing nature of weapons
and other equipment, and the way in
which modern military organisations
operate, stems largely from developments in information technology.
In this respect, as in many others, our
armed forces must be equipped and
trained to embrace this new technology
to a level that will enable them to
operate effectively, either alone or in
concert with allied forces, both at home
and abroad, in meeting future threats
and challenges.


**NORWEGIAN AREA OF RESPONSIBILITY**


become increasingly important as a
strategy for the further development of
Norway’s Armed Forces. This applies
first and foremost to cooperation with
our allies in NATO, but also within a
broader international framework. It is
of decisive importance to Norway that
NATO remains the central transatlantic
forum, bringing together European and
North American security supported by
the appropriate military capabilities.
Norway must contribute actively to the
modernisation of NATO. This means
continuing to contribute relevant
capabilities to NATO’s structures and
operations and making Norway’s
unique training facilities available to
the Alliance. Ensuring that NATO
maintains a high level of training activity in Norway is a matter of the highest
priority. Task sharing, role specialisation and multinational cooperation
within NATO in areas such as education and training, logistics and joint
force contributions all offer benefits in


terms of cost-effectiveness. By such
means it is possible for small countries
like Norway, acting in concert with
others, to achieve more than would
ever be possible if acting alone.
There is nothing incompatible between
the Armed Forces’ requirements relevant to their various missions at home
and abroad. Quite the contrary, in fact.
In shaping the Armed Forces for their
future activities, the experience gained
from national and international activities will be seen as sources of mutual
benefit.

**Developments in technology**
Developments in technology are of
enormous importance to the Armed
Forces. Modern technology creates
new possibilities for meeting new security threats in a more efficient manner.
The development of new type of
weapons and new systems for surveillance, information and communication
are examples of this. At the same time,


##### International cooperation strengthens our national security

## Operational structure


###### JOINT CAPABILITIES

Modern military operations are
becoming increasingly “joint”, with
the various Services working closely
together and sharing resources. The
new structure embodies a range of
capabilities which are either themselves
new, or are incorporated in a new joint
structural framework.
These joint capabilities include the
Armed Forces’ command structure,
Special Forces with their own integrated helicopter wing, and a joint ISTAR
unit for intelligence, surveillance, target
acquisition and reconnaissance purposes. ISTAR is one of the areas being
addressed in NATO’s military transformation. The joint capabilities also
include a number of smaller units
specialising in logistics, medical matters
and the clearance of mines and other
explosives.

**The command structure**
Our National Joint Headquarters
(NJHQ) in Stavanger will be co-located
with NATO’s Joint Warfare Centre.
Regional Headquarters North Norway
(RHQNN) at Reitan will function as a
forward command centre for crisis
management. Regional Headquarters
South Norway (RHQSN) in Trondheim
will be closed. Twelve Home Guard
Districts will be retained and strengthened through the ongoing quality
upgrade of the Home Guard, an important programme in view of the Home
Guard’s responsibility for territorial
defence.
The purpose behind the rationalisation


of the command structure is to transfer
resources and responsibility to operational units. Advances in the field of
information and communications technology make it feasible for each link in
the chain of command to exercise a
broader span of control. The transition
from a mobilisation based defence to a
defence based on a rapid reaction capability has reduced the need for regional
commands. NJHQ will, as at present, be
able to delegate command responsibility for Home Guard Districts, and other
appropriate resources, to the Command
at Reitan. NJHQ will be responsible for
matters relating to the forward storage
facilities in Trøndelag.

**The Special Forces**
The Special Forces will be strengthened
and an air wing is being established for
special operations based on the use of
earmarked helicopters from the existing 720 Squadron. The Special Forces
represent a capability of critical importance to national crisis management as
well as for multinational operations
abroad.

A joint Information and
**Communications Infrastructure Unit is**
being set up to support Norwegian
forces on deployment.

Provision is being made for jointly
**funded air-to-ground surveillance**
within NATO, a high priority area for
the Alliance.
Solutions to the requirements for
**air-to-air refuelling, strategic airlift**


**and strategic sealift capabilities are**
being sought through NATO joint
projects.

**Establishment of an ISTAR unit**
An ISTAR unit is being set up for intelligence, surveillance, target acquisition
and reconnaissance purposes. ISTAR is
an important area within NATO, and is
relevant to a wide range of missions
both at home and aborad. In particular,
the ISTAR unit will make an important
contribution to national crisis management in that it can quickly establish a
military presence and contribute to the
acquisition of information and intelligence. Unmanned aerial vehicles
(UAVs) are being procured for use in
an ISTAR context. The ISTAR unit is
able to operate with other units in a
multinational setting and with elements
from all Service branches. The unit is
based mainly on existing reconnaissance and Special Forces units. Force
elements such as UAV’s and Coastal
Ranger units may take part at divisional
or corps level in allied operations.
The Coastal Ranger Command will be
developed further and will have the
capability to operate both on naval
missions and as part of the ISTAR unit.

Priority is also given to protection
against nuclear, radiological, bacteriological and chemical (NRBC) weapons,
with action being taken to upgrade the
organisational structure, improve individual and unit protective equipment,
and to establish dedicated specialist
units.


-----

**Several logistics and support**
**elements, including medical units, are**
being made deployable. Some of these
capabilities will also be highly relevant
in the Total Defence context. This will
not only enhance Norway’s national
operational capability but it will also
enable Norway to make a broader force
contribution internationally.

###### THE ARMY

The Army will establish a usable and
deployable brigade, Brigade North.
This will, in all, require two sets of
brigade equipment. The second set,
together with fully trained personnel,
will form the framework for a mobilisation brigade, Brigade 6. Brigade North
will be made more usable and deployable, which will mean a need for a
larger element of standing forces and
personnel on stand-by contracts. This
brigade provides an appropriate framework for the Norwegian Army’s
activities and ensures that all-round
competence at brigade level is maintained. The establishment of Brigade
North as a deployable unit meets
NATO’s force readiness requirements
for a reaction time of 180 days. The
reaction time can be reduced substantially for some of the brigade elements,
including the support and logistics
units, which will be at a considerably
higher degree of readiness. The
Telemark Battalion will continue as a
rapid reaction force within Brigade
North. Brigade 6 replaces Brigade 12


(Trøndelag Brigade). Brigade 5 is
being disbanded. The Border Guard
and the Norwegian Royal Guards,
H M the King’s Guard, will remain as
at present. In addition, the Norwegian
Army will have a Divisional Command
(6th Division) as well as corps and
divisional units for multinational
operations.

###### THE NAVY

Fridtjof Nansen Class frigates equipped
with NH 90 helicopters and Skjold
Class vessels are being phased in.
These new vessels will help to give the
Norwegian Navy a modern, flexible
fleet with substantially increased
capability. The existing Hauk Class
MTBs will be phased out as the new
Skjold Class enters service.
Six Mine Countermeasure Vessels will
be retained and upgraded and two will
be phased out. Three submarines will
be upgraded to enable them to carry
out a broader spectrum of missions.
The Norwegian Navy will also have the
capability for the command and control
of both national and multinational naval
forces. The Coastal Ranger Command
will be developed to operate as a part of
the joint ISTAR unit. The Coast Guard
will continue as at present.

###### THE AIR FORCE

48 combat aircraft will be upgraded and
will continue in service within the operational structure. The aim is to be able


to deploy up to one squadron of combat
aircraft. One air defence battery
(NASAMS) will be made deployable
while a second battery, to be manned
on mobilisation, will continue to be
available. Air defence systems will be
upgraded and will be given a certain
capability against cruise missiles. Other
aircraft, including transport aircraft,
maritime patrol aircraft and transport
helicopters, will be retained. The Air
Force will be provided with sets of base
equipment for the support, command
and control of contributions deployed
on operations outside Norway.

###### THE HOME GUARD

The Home Guard is of critical importance when faced with new security
threats and will have important tasks
relating to protect infra structure, force
protection for national and allied forces
and storage facilities. The Home Guard

###### Quality reform and specialisation will make the Home Guard more relevant

judicial authorities, if the need arises.
The quality of the Home Guard will be
substantially improved with the
implementation of the planned quality
reforms. The operational structure of
the Home Guard will in future include


**Rapid reaction forces will number**
approximately 5,000 on a national basis.
These forces will be available at short
notice. Their equipment will be
upgraded and modernised.
**Reinforcement forces will number**
approximately 25,000 on a national
basis.
**Follow-on forces will number approxi-**
mately 20,000 on a national basis.
**Reserve personnel will be enrolled but**
will not be required to take part in
training exercises.


###### HOME GUARD – DISTRICTS AND STAFF LOCATIONS 

50,000 personnel with a further 33,000
in reserve. Personnel will be organised
into rapid reaction forces, reinforce-
ment forces and follow-on forces
together with a reserve. The number of
Home Guard districts is being reduced
from 18 to 12, while the system of
division into districts, sectors and areas
will continue. Home Guard funding will
at the same time be increased to allow
for modernisation, the procurement of
new equipment and increased training.

## Personnel and professional competence


participation, on family life for example,
will be distributed more fairly.

###### CONSCRIPTION – a Pillar of Norwegian Defence 

The system of universal military service ensures that the Armed Forces
have access to the most highly motivated and suitably qualified young people.
This form of national service is one of
the main pillars of the Norwegian
defence system and it helps to anchor
the concept of defence and the Armed
Forces firmly in the Norwegian society.
At the same time, it is essential that
this system of conscription should be
based firmly on the needs of the Armed
Forces, enabling the Services to recruit
a sufficient number of well motivated
and suitably qualified young people to
man the operational structure. The
requirements of the Armed Forces, in
terms of the skills and the personnel
needed to enable Norway to participate
in operations both at home and abroad,
mean that the system of conscription


The Norwegian Armed Forces need to
be able to recruit the best in terms of
suitability and motivation. High levels
of competence and motivation are
needed at all levels and in every branch
of the defence organisation. At present,
the personnel and education system is
not yet fully in line with the progress of
modernisation and the new missions
of the Armed Forces. Throughout the
defence organisation there is a need
for a balanced personnel structure that
matches the tasks to be carried out.
With this in view, a number of reforms
are proposed to form the basis for a
more appropriate personnel structure
and the necessary degree of flexibility.

Advanced technology, and the more
complex and demanding nature of
today’s missions at home and abroad,
put new demands on the officer corps.
Moreover, those officers with personnel under their direct command also
bear responsibility for the safety of
each individual. Thus in order to
increase the operational effectiveness
of units in the field, and to ensure
better personnel safety under both
operational and exercise conditions,
it is necessary to increase the level of
experience required in junior ranks.

Changes in the structure and organisation of the Armed Forces have in turn
led to changes in the structure in the
officer corps. For the future, the Armed
Forces will have a greater need for
junior officers to undertake duties
associated with training, readiness and


operations. Today’s situation leads to a
structure within in the officer corps as
a whole, that is largely dictated by the
need for a large number of young officers in the junior levels of the organisation. This in turn leads to substantial
overmanning at the higher levels.

It is also essential to ensure that the
Armed Forces have a stable and predictable body of personnel available
for all types of operation. The Armed
Forces’ new missions and the need for
rapid reaction capability and deployability in a broad range of situations, call
for a more flexible personnel system.
Today, participation in operations
abroad is a natural and integral part of
all defence missions. In the past, participation has been voluntary – except for
NATO Article 5 operations. In 1999 the
acceptance of an assignment abroad
was made mandatory for officers entering the Military Academy, in situations
where there were insufficient volunteers. Moreover, because of the large
number of personnel serving at any
given time, it has in the past been
possible to recruit a small proportion to
form special ad hoc units for operations
abroad. Now that numerically smaller
defence forces are being asked to
contribute to the entire spectrum of
missions, it is no longer feasible to continue the principle of voluntary participation. It is important to ensure that
competence acquired from experience
in operations abroad is distributed over
the whole of the officer corps. This will
also mean that the impact of such


must, in practice, be adjusted to meet
these requirements. Because this
universal military service is so essential to Norway’s defence capability, it is
important to ensure that it is seen as a
positive and meaningful experience.
Call-up for military service is dependent on the needs of the Armed Forces,
which in practice means that approximately 9,500 young people, as against
about 10,500 in recent years, will undergo an initial period of service within a
flexible system which offers basic
training, apprenticeship schemes and
recruiting opportunities. Additional
measures are being brought in to
enhance the attractiveness and status
of serving in this way, such as
increased lump sum payments on
completion and a possible scheme for
awarding higher education credits to
those who complete 12 months of initial
training is under consideration

The lump sum payable on completion
is being increased from NOK 8,900 to
**NOK 15,000 in 2005 for those who**
serve for 12 months. The intention is to


increase these payments still further
over the 4-year period.

###### PROPOSED PERSONNEL REFORMS:
**The Armed Forces Personnel Act**
A separate Proposition is forwarded to
Parliament, containing proposals for a
new Armed Forces Personnel Act that
will bring together the overall regulations for personnel policy and administration in the Armed Forces. The various proposals are outlined below.

**Subaltern Officers**
In order to strengthen competence in
the junior ranks and allow for greater
continuity and specialisation, a new
officer category, Subaltern Officer, with
rank from Sergeant to Lieutenant, is
introduced. Subaltern Officers will
have the same rights and obligations as
regular officers, but their engagements
will normally terminate when they
reach the age of 35. Subaltern Officers
will have special education and career


-----

**The Military Academies**
The Military Academies will adapt
the structure of their teaching to
correspond to a three-year course at
Bachelor level. Each of the Academies
will provide a professional education
oriented primarily towards the needs
of that Service branch. The curriculum will be made more flexible to
allow parts of the Academy course to
be combined with higher education at
a civil academic institution.

**The Staff College**
The Staff College will offer higher
level courses for officers with the
focus on higher command and
management, staff duties and the use
of military power, including the planning and execution of joint operations.
The courses will be at Master’s level
with a duration of one to two years.
Students successfully completing a
two-year course will be awarded a
Master’s degree.

**Women in the Armed Forces**
The Armed Forces are actively seeking to recruit and retain women. One
of the central aims is to increase the
proportion of women in the defence
organisation, including the Armed
Forces, and a positive trend has been
seen in recent years. One measure
intended to help achieve this aim is
the call-up of all women to a conscription board interview. Because there is
no compulsory military service for
women, attendance will be voluntary.
This measure will help to ensure that


women are better informed about the
purpose and duties of the Armed
Forces, the educational opportunities
and the varied and exciting workplace
that the Armed Forces can offer.

###### RECRUITING

One principal aim is to enable the
Armed Forces to recruit the most suited and most highly motivated young
people, both men and women. The
conscription board will be developed to
become a central tool for the purpose
of selection and recruiting. Particular
importance will be attached to correct
classification and allocation so that


opportunities. A bonus will be awarded to those who serve until the age
limit of 35, in order to assist their
transition to a career in civilian life.
This scheme will ensure greater predictability and continuity both for the
individual and for the Armed Forces,
and it will help to enhance the level of
competence at the lower levels of the
organisation. The introduction of the
Subaltern Officer represents a clear
step forward if compared to current
arrangements.

**Regular officers**
Regular officers include those who
have completed their Military
Academy training, and the subsequent
obligatory period of service, or who
have gained corresponding civilian
academic qualifications. The number
of regular officers needed will be
subject to review and adjustment in
the light of the introduction of the
Subaltern Officer scheme.

**Mandatory assignments abroad**
A scheme is being introduced to make
it obligatory to accept an assignment
to serve abroad. This will apply to all
officers and certain categories of
civilian personnel. In practice, assignments will be made in such a way that
an individual’s service is divided fairly
between operational assignments and
domestic service. This will ensure that
the burden of serving away from
home, as well the additional competence gained, are shared by all in a fair
and predictable manner. It is very


important to establish equitable
arrangements for the rotation of all
members of the Armed Forces. The
new arrangements are essential in
order to enable the same units to
operate at home and abroad. Priority
will be given to the care of personnel
during and following their service.

A more flexible personnel system in
which pay and conditions of employment take more account of the need to
achieve the aim of having personnel
with the right skills in the right place
in the organisation.

**New educational arrangements**
The system of education in the Armed
Forces will offer Bachelor and Master
degrees to those who successfully
complete officer education. The
specific course content will be based
on military requirements, but meet
requirements and standards of civilian
education and degrees.

**The Officer Candidate Schools will be**
**retained and modernised**
The arrangements for a 2-year
vocational qualification will continue
but in a more flexible way and more
closely linked with the operational
environments and competence centres
of the various Service branches. The
course content will be modernised to
cover both professional subjects and
more general officer training. This will
provide the best foundation for high
quality officer training.


numbers dropping out during initial
service are minimised. Another aim is
to ensure that there is only a short time
between conscription board and call-up.
As in the past, young people will be
able to apply for Officer Candidate
School prior to their call-up for initial
military service. This is intended to
assist the recruiting of both men and
women. The Officer Candidate Schools
and the Military Academies will also be
able to recruit from those who are
undertaking their initial period of
military service.

The introduction of the Subaltern
Officer scheme will ensure consider

ably improved opportunities for those
who do not have the ambition to pursue
a longer and more theoretical course of
education but who nevertheless wish to
work in the Armed Forces. The bonus
arrangements, interesting work, good
leadership training and experience
combined with a solid professional
grounding, will all help to make this a
good recruiting channel.
Regular officers receive pay during
their education; are given the opportunity, through their training, to gain
civilian academic qualifications; and
they will enjoy challenging service as
military leaders and commanders in
the Armed Services.

## Logistics and support


grated with the force production units.
Overall, the measures recommended
will, at the latest by 2008, entail the
transfer of approximately NOK
**2 billion annually from logistics and**
support activities to force production,
operational activities, international
operations and materiel investment,
compared with 2004 levels. This
represents a contribution of decisive
importance to the achievement of a
force structure in long term balance.

Those areas of logistics and support
activity that do not need to be under the
direct control of the Armed Forces will
be put out to competitive tender and, if
appropriate and financially advantageous, contracted out. The competitive
tendering and associated reorganisation
will be carried out in compliance with
the EEA regulations governing public
sector procurement and support.


Logistics and support collectively relate
to all functions which supply and
support the operational structure and
activities of the Armed Forces and help
to ensure that the overall defence aims
are achieved. Areas covered include,
for example, property management,
administrative services, technical
maintenance and materiel procurement.
New operational requirements for the
Armed Forces, coupled with increasingly stringent calls for further rationalisation and better use of resources, makes
it essential to further improve the logistic and support activities of the Armed
Forces. The Armed Forces’ operational
capability must be strengthened and a
better balance must be achieved
between the resources needed and the
resources available, something which is
not possible without shifting resources
from logistics and support activities to
operational areas and new investment.


To make the logistics and support
organisation robust in the face of
change, its structure should as far as
possible remain the same in peacetime
as in time of crisis, armed conflict or
war. Multilateral cooperation, mobile
logistic solutions, and cooperation with
civil agencies will be given increased
emphasis in future. Logistics and support units with a rapid reaction capability and high availability, capable of
accompanying operational units wherever they are deployed, either at home or
abroad, will be given high priority. In
addition, a higher proportion of personnel employed in logistics and support
activities will in future be available for
service with operational logistics units.
A further proposal is to make the training organisation more efficient (education, training and exercising). The training establishments and competence
centres will to a greater extent be inte

-----

**The establishment of joint facilities**
New joint service facilities are being
set up at Sessvollmoen Base
(Competence Centre for Defence
Logistics) and Jørstadmoen Base
(Competence Centre for Command,
Control and Information Systems) in
order to benefit from the synergy
effects of the three Services working
together and to free resources for
reallocation to operational activities
and materiel investment.
A common framework for organisation
and equipment development will be
established. This will facilitate joint
action and interoperability between the
Services. It will also mean that a larger
proportion of the personnel will be
available for operational activities.

**Competence Centre for Defence**
**logistics**
The Competence Centre for Defence
Logistics is being established at
Sessvollmoen Base. This competence
centre will cover logistics, administration, medical support and NRBC
protection. These are all important
areas in the context of supporting the
deployment and running of operational
capabilities. The Defence Munitions
School, now at Kjevik, will move to the
Competence Centre for Logistics at
Sessvollmoen. The Air Force Training
Centre will remain at Kjevik, as will the
Home Guard District Staff.


**Competence Centre for Command,**
**Control and Information systems**
The Competence Centres for
Command, Control and Information
systems will be brought together at
Jørstadmoen Base. The establishment
of a joint competence centre will allow
a substantially greater degree of
control and coordination of activities
within the centre as well as between
Service branches and between the
various levels of the Defence
organisation.

**Administrative training**
The content and coverage of administrative training in the Armed Forces
will be changed substantially. The
School of Administration in Halden will
be closed and the remaining training
activities will be carried out at the
Competence Centre for Logistics at
Sessvollmoen and at the Defence Staff
College at Akershus.

**A modern Navy**
Preparations are in hand for new and
far-reaching changes in the activities of
the Royal Norwegian Navy over the
coming planning period.

The Coastal Ranger Command is being
moved from Trondenes in Harstad to
Olavsvern in Tromsø because the existing infrastructure at Olavsvern is better
suited to the needs of this Command.
The Coastal Ranger Command will provide a mobile capability and will train
with both Norwegian and allied forces
from Olavsvern, 6th Division, Ramsund
and Åsegarden (Harstad). Åsegarden,
**as Allied Training Centre North, will**
**continue to operate in Harstad as at**
**present.**
Naval officers’ basic training will


continue to be carried out at the Naval
Officer Candidate School in Horten,
while specialisation and technical training will take place at the Naval Training
Centre in Bergen. Surplus buildings in
Horten can thus be made available for
other purposes in collaboration with
the Horten local authorities.

**A modern Air Force**
In order to bring together the various
Air Force centres of competence, the
Air Command and Control Unit will be
moving from Mågerø to Rygge. The Air
Force Training and Competence
Centre (LUKS) is already located at
Rygge Air Station. This measure means
a greater concentration of professional
expertise while providing an opportunity to benefit from the synergy effects of


co-locating Air Force training with the
operational, development and experimental environments.

The air defence battery at Bodø Main
Air Station is being moved to Ørland,
again offering synergy benefits in
terms of shared competence and
financial savings. F-16 intermediate
level maintenance is being moved from
Ørland to Bodø. This opens the way for
an increase in operational flying hours
at Ørland.

Evenes, Torp, Langnes (Tromsø),
Flesland and Værnes will be closed as
mobilisation airfields. This will have no
effect on Allied training or on the forward storage facilities in Trøndelag.

**A strengthened Home Guard**
Twelve new Home Guard Districts are
being established with their Staffs and
with new geographical boundaries.
The quality reform proposed for the
Home Guard will ensure that the
organisation is better matched to its
missions in the new security environment. The territorial organisation will
be leaner, with 12 rather than the 18
Districts of today. This allows for a
reduction in the real estate required by
the Home Guard, which in turn allows
funds to be redirected towards
operational activities.

## Key economic outlines


Annual investment in materiel will
be increased by NOK 2 billion over
the period compared to the 2004-level.
This represents on average
approximately 29 percent of the
total budget.


###### THE FOLLOWING RESTRUCTUR- ING TARGETS ARE PROPOSED:

**At the latest by 2008, a minimum**
**of NOK 2 billion (NOK 2004) is to be**
**reallocated from logistics and support**
**activities to operational activities and**
**materiel investment, compared with**
**2004. Of this, a minimum net sum of**
**NOK 600 million is to be diverted from**
**the Defence Logistics Organisation.**

These targets are to be achieved as
rapidly as possible, and no later than
the end of 2008. The overall objectives
for the period up to and including 2005
remain unchanged.


Redirection of resources from support
to operational activities, increased
investment in materiel and the changes
in the personnel system, are central
elements of the long-term planning
period 2005-2008, the purpose of which
is to ensure that Norway has
a new Defence for a new era.

**NOK billions**
**2004**


Substantial funding, of the order of
NOK 2 billion, will be redirected from
logistics and support activities to operational activities in the armed services.

Efficiency improvements and costsaving measures together will mean
that operating costs over the period will
be reduced by NOK 900 million
compared with 2004 levels.


The Government is working on the
basis that defence funding requirements over the period 2005-2008 will
amount to NOK 118 billion at 2004
prices. This gives an average annual
budget of NOK 29.5 billion over this
period, which represents a moderate
increase compared with the 2004
budget level. The Government therefore recommends continuing substantial investment in the modernisation of
the Armed Forces, and considers that
it is fully possible to create a defence
organisation, including the Armed
Forces, of very high quality given that
level of funding. Those measures which


impact on the size and composition of
the structure will both maintain core
competence and strengthen operational
capability. This means that Norwegian
defence organisation will, over the
period 2005-2008, have a sound foundation, both structurally and financially,
on which to conduct its activities.
