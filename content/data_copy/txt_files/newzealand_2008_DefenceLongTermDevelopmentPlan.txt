### Preface by the Minister of Defence Photo of the Minister of Defence, Hon Phil Goff.

I am delighted to release this fourth update of the Defence LongTerm Development Plan (LTDP) which is intended to provide a
snapshot as at September 2008 of progress in re-equipping the
New Zealand Defence Force (NZDF). One of the guiding
principles of the Government’s Defence Policy Framework
released in June 2000 was that the NZDF must be equipped and
trained for combat as well as peacekeeping. The LTDP, which
commenced in 2002, is the Government’s blueprint for equipping
the NZDF as a combat capable force.

The LTDP provides a ten year planning framework from 20022012 which allows decisions on defence acquisitions to be
prioritised and taken in the context of the Government’s defence
policy, and funding envelopes.

Key features of this update include:

  - reporting on the major progress in acquiring and introducing into service
equipment procured under the LTDP, reflected by the creation of a new category,
_Capability Delivered;_

  - the addition of a Network Enabled Capability strategy to guide the management of
information technology-based projects on the LTDP; and

  - the listing of a new project ‘Night Vision Equipment’ which will ensure the NZDF
can operate and train more effectively at night or in conditions of reduced light.

The remaining four years of the LTDP will see the introduction into service of a number of
significant new capabilities including the Project Protector fleet, NH90 medium utility
helicopters and A109 training and light utility helicopters. These sit alongside a series of
projects that are well underway, including modifications to the Boeing 757s and upgrades
to the C-130 and P-3 fleets, and will join the Army’s Light Armoured Vehicles and Light
Operational Vehicles, already in service.

Since 1999, the Government has made a substantial investment in Defence. This is
underlined by the update of the LTDP which shows that the NZDF is becoming a
modernised, effective and deployable force.

The Government is committed to the overall affordability of the LTDP. Defence is working
to address the challenges posed by inflation and currency fluctuation to the overall cost of
projects. With careful management, the remaining funding will be used to complete
priority projects on the LTDP.

### 1. Introduction 

1.1 First released on 11 June 2002, and publicly updated in 2003, 2004, and 2006 the
_Defence Long-Term Development Plan (LTDP) is the main capital planning tool to_
enable decisions on defence acquisitions to be taken in the context of the
Government's defence policy, the priority of projects and affordability. The LTDP
links the Government's defence policy objectives, which were set out in the
Defence Policy Framework released in June 2000, with the capability
requirements announced in the Defence Statement of 8 May 2001. This version,
the fourth public update of the plan, contains a comprehensive list of projects, with
costings (some of which are estimates only), timings, and priorities.

1.2 The LTDP:

a. describes major acquisition projects required to provide military capabilities to
meet the Government's defence policy objectives;

b. reflects relative priorities of the projects, measured against the Government's
defence policy and requirements;

c. works within agreed financial limitations; and

d. summarises the planning and decision making processes used to ensure that
investment in defence provides the best value for money.

#### Funding Parameters

1.3 The LTDP is managed within approved financial parameters. These include:

a. a commitment from the Government of around $4 billion over 10 years,
comprising a capital injection of $1.209 billion, proceeds from assets sales,
and retained depreciation.

b. consideration of leasing options where there is a fiscally neutral trade-off
between capital and operating expenditure.

1.4 Capital costs cited represent the estimated cost of purchasing the assets and
bringing them into service (excluding GST). For projects where it has been
possible to estimate whole-of-life costs, albeit with some uncertainty, these
estimates have also been provided.

#### Project Summary Sheets

1.5 Project summary sheets have been prepared for those projects in sections 5 to 12
of the LTDP. Each summary sheet describes the project, how it contributes to the
Government's defence policy, links to other projects and capabilities, timing
issues, estimated costs and possible options where these are known. Options
and trade-offs for defence acquisitions are investigated, costed and presented to
Ministers as projects are brought forward for approval.

### 2. The LTDP and Defence Policy

2.1 The LTDP sets out the major capital acquisition projects that will enable the NZDF
to implement the Government's defence policy objectives.

2.2 In the 8 May 2001 Defence Statement, the Government stated that it is:

"building a modern, professional and well-equipped Defence Force with the
necessary military capabilities across all three services to meet New Zealand's
objectives... the New Zealand Defence Force is being reconfigured so that it is
sustainable and affordable over the long-term. It will be able both to meet New
Zealand's own defence and security needs, and to make a useful contribution
when it is deployed."[1]

2.3 The Government's defence policy objectives are:

    - to defend New Zealand and to protect its people, land, territorial waters,
Exclusive Economic Zone, natural resources and critical infrastructure;

    - to meet our alliance commitments to Australia by maintaining a close defence
partnership in pursuit of common security interests;

    - to assist in the maintenance of security in the South Pacific and to provide
assistance to our Pacific neighbours;

    - to play an appropriate role in the maintenance of security in the Asia-Pacific
region, including meeting our obligations as a member of the Five Power
Defence Arrangements; and

    - to contribute to global security and peacekeeping through participation in the
full range of UN and other appropriate multilateral peace support and
humanitarian relief operations.[2]

#### LTDP Projects

2.4 LTDP projects are grouped in terms of:

    - the stage they have reached in their acquisition cycle (categories A and B
below); or

    - whether they have received approval in principle from the Government
(category C below); or

    - projects that are under development (categories D-G below); or

    - projects that are being managed under the Defence Capital Project Minor

### 3. Funding

3.1 The NZDF manages its funding through two envelopes: the LTDP for capital
expenditure; and the Defence Sustainability Initiative (DSI) for operating
expenditure.

3.2 The LTDP capital envelope is defined by the sum total of funds from depreciation,
asset sales and available capital injections, and the operating envelope by the
baseline and annual increments under the DSI.

3.3 Should these fiscal envelopes be unable to fund all projects on the current LTDP,
prioritisation will be required with some projects being deferred, scaled down, or
cancelled.

#### Affordability of the LTDP

3.4 Affordability depends on matching approved and planned expenditure for LTDP
projects against the NZDF’s inward cash flows. The cash flows for some of these
projects are already known since contracts have been approved and contractual
payments have been determined. For those projects that have not yet gone out to
tender, cash flows reflect estimates of how contractual payments are likely to be
structured once negotiations have been concluded with the successful tenderer.

3.5 Cost estimates for planned projects are made on the best evidence at the time
and are updated regularly, but by definition, are less accurate for projects planned
for later time periods. As such, there is a degree of uncertainty surrounding the
cost of those projects within the LTDP that have not yet been the subject of a
request for proposal or request for tender. In this update, estimates for projects
not under contract are provided in bands rather than in the form of a point
estimate.

#### Defence Sustainability Initiative

3.6 In December 2003 the Government initiated a review to identify both current and
optimum configuration and resource requirements for the defence organisation to
undertake the roles and tasks set out in the Government’s statements of defence
policy and in the LTDP. The resulting Defence Capability and Resourcing Review
was presented to Ministers in February 2005. It confirmed that operational and
organisational capabilities in a number of areas of the NZDF and Ministry of
Defence were below what is required by government policy. This led to the May
2005 DSI policy statement which outlined a major remedial programme and a firm
commitment of increased resources over the next 10 years to achieve long-term
sustainability for Defence. It saw additional funding being provided (excluding
GST) of $4.6 billion (operating) and $209 million (capital) over the period 2005
through to 2015.

#### Whole-of-Life Costing

3.7 Whole-of-life costing incorporates both capital and operating costs for a project or
capability. This provides a way of determining the overall affordability of projects
or new capabilities for the NZDF.

3.8 LTDP cost estimates need to be consistent with the new Capital Asset
Management (CAM) requirements, which have been developed by Treasury in
conjunction with the State Services Commission. CAM is designed to achieve
greater value for money from capital purchases by assessing the cost of an asset
through its entire life, with life cycle costing forming a vital part of this process.


-----

3.9 Project sheets, where applicable, include the estimated life of the capability, their
estimated acquisition cost, and their estimated whole-of-life cost. The whole-oflife cost figures in the project sheets are provisional and are being further refined.
This will ensure that CAM requirements are fully met. In addition, for this LTDP
update, the figures for whole-of-life costs are based on the total estimated cost in
nominal dollars rather than being discounted.

#### Financial Risks

3.10 In addition to the uncertainty surrounding the cost of projects within the LTDP that
have not yet entered their acquisition phase, there are several financial risks
associated with the LTDP that have to be managed to ensure the LTDP remains
affordable. These include:

a. **Inflation. Estimated costs of projects reflect the impact of military inflation, and**
where appropriate consumer price index and construction price inflation.

b. **Foreign Exchange Movements. Project costs in this LTDP update have been**
converted from USD/EURO into NZD using exchange rate projections advised
by Treasury (below). Notably, these are official forecast rates based on a
Treasury model. Actual rates at the time when contracts are signed are likely to
differ from these forecasts resulting in changes to actual project costs.
Ministers have recently agreed to a foreign exchange policy which extends the
methods by which foreign exchange risk can be managed. This should help to
reduce, but will not eliminate the uncertainty of project costs. The policy
includes the establishment and maintenance of a “Foreign Exchange Risk
Register” to record and monitor foreign exchange exposures. Work is
underway to make the register operational.

**Fiscal Year 08/09** **Fiscal Year 09/10** **Fiscal Year 10/11**
**Onwards**

USD 0.7567 0.7031 0.6554

EURO 0.4966 0.4513 0.4158

c. **Upgrades. Military equipment requires regular upgrading to ensure that it is**
able to provide the required capability. Upgrades are also important to keep
pace with technological changes, and to maintain interoperability with other
defence forces. When the actual cost, or timing, of an upgrade differs from
what was expected there are financial repercussions for both the capital and
operating envelopes. Known upgrades have been included in the LTDP. Other
unpredicted upgrades as a result of unexpected obsolescence, urgent
operational requirements or the introduction of new technologies may be
required in the life of military equipment. These will also be managed and
prioritised against the current LTDP, or its replacement.

d. **Personnel and Operating Costs. The NZDF is aware of the need to manage**
the fiscal risks that result from:

      - Operating baseline changes that will need to take account of pay increases
and changes in NZDF personnel numbers, training requirements,
maintenance and the actual operating costs resulting from new equipment.

      - Changes in operational tempo which impact on both capital and operating
costs.

|Col1|Fiscal Year 08/09|Fiscal Year 09/10|Fiscal Year 10/11 Onwards|
|---|---|---|---|
|USD|0.7567|0.7031|0.6554|
|EURO|0.4966|0.4513|0.4158|


-----

e. **Asset Revaluations. Most of the NZDF’s capital equipment is purchased in**
USD or EURO. Changes to New Zealand Financial Reporting Standards
dictate that all assets are to be revalued annually, with a consequential impact
on the funding arising from depreciation. Should the depreciation funding be
greater than that forecast, the NZDF is able to seek this additional funding from
the Government up to and including 2009/10. Future arrangements for the
management of depreciation are under consideration.


-----

### 4. Managing the LTDP

4.1 The Defence Capability Management Framework (outlined below) is the key
process used by Defence to ensure that the LTDP remains a core decision
making tool for the Government and that projects are well managed and
consistent with government policy.

4.2 The LTDP is updated regularly to provide the best information possible to inform
decisions on defence acquisitions and the budget cycle. LTDP updates and
accompanying reports to Ministers may be warranted:

a. by the availability of new information;

b. whenever acquisition proposals are submitted for the Government’s
consideration;

c. when significant financial or policy developments occur;

d. by the need to support the financial impact of NZDF asset revaluations; and

e. by the need for Ministers to consider the overall context of total planned
acquisitions with a clear view of priorities, risks and trade-offs.

#### Capability Management Framework

4.3 The Capability Management Framework (CMF) is a joint Ministry of Defence/
NZDF governance and management system for capability development. The CMF
outlines responsibility, accountability and processes for identifying capability
requirements, capability definition, delivery of capability – including acquisition,
introduction into service, maintaining in service, obsolescence and disposal.

4.4 The CMF guides the capability development process starting with broad estimates
of capability requirements and rough estimates of costs. At each step in the
capability development process more information is added resulting in
requirements and costs gaining greater fidelity. The CMF also allows HQ NZDF,
single Services and the Ministry of Defence to plan for, and allocate appropriate
resources to, those projects that have a higher priority on the LTDP.

4.5 Ministers must also have confidence that projects are well managed and that
acquisition activity is consistent with the Government’s direction. This is achieved
by the Ministry of Defence and the NZDF following the processes outlined in the
CMF. These include:

a. **Project Initiation: Ministerial Note. On the completion of preliminary work**
within Defence, the Minister of Defence is invited to note that work is to
commence on a LTDP project.

b. **Initial Gate: Approval to Initiate. The outcome of the Definition Phase is the**
Initial Gate Investment Case. This presents a high level cost-benefit and risk
analysis of the status quo and other conceptually different options. The
analysis is submitted to government seeking its Approval to Initiate a
capability project and conduct a detailed assessment of an agreed set of
options.

Following approval, the options are explored. The exact equipment to be
acquired to meet the capability requirements has still not been decided at this
point. Cost and delivery estimates developed at this stage are, therefore, still
significantly uncertain, albeit somewhat less uncertain than those made when
approval to initiate was sought.


-----

c. **Main Gate:** **Approval to Commence Acquisition. Following assessment of**
capability options, the Main Gate Investment Case is prepared. This
describes in detail the proposal for investment, supported by links to strategy,
a risk analysis and options for mitigating risk, a cost-benefit analysis, an
implementation or procurement plan, and a specification of expected
performance.

The exact equipment to achieve the capability needed has not been decided
at this point, but real options for the kind of equipment to be acquired have
been identified and examined. While Defence will make an assessment of
potential solutions and their possible costs, the most cost effective solution is
only identified once industry has been formally approached in the next phase.

Once Cabinet’s approval to commence has been given, the market will be
approached and, generally, a process of competitive tendering will be
undertaken. Industry will be invited to propose solutions to meet the capability
requirement, as expressed in a set of functional performance specifications
that set out what the capability is to achieve. Defence does not call for tender
against specific or identifiable products.

d. **Approval to Negotiate: Following an evaluation of proposals or tenders,**
Defence will seek Approval to Negotiate with potential supplier(s). This may
include seeking approval for the NZDF to acquire all other functional
components of the capability described in the proposal.

e. **Approval to Commit: Once negotiations with the preferred tenderer are**
complete, government approval is sought to commit funds. The approval to
commit contains the financial authority that specifies the amount to be spent
on the acquisition (usually the contract price and Defence’s associated
project management costs).

acquisition phase, with shading indicating the stage which the project has

4.7 The CMF is to be reviewed to ensure that projects on the LTDP are defined,
costed and presented to Ministers in accordance with the Government’s new
Capital Asset Management principles.

#### Network Enabled Capability Strategy 

4.8 The networking of military capabilities is essential for a modern defence force.
Reflecting developments in this field the NZDF introduced its Network Enabled
Capability Strategy (NEC) in 2007. This strategy was introduced in recognition of
the need to use modern information technology to link sensors, decision makers
and weapon systems to help people, units and platforms work together more
effectively to achieve the NZDF Joint Effect. The NZDF NEC recognises that
there are four key component capabilities namely: infrastructure, Command and
Control (C2) systems, equipment, and sensors. Future capabilities (new assets,
replacements or upgrades) within the NZDF network will be required to operate
effectively regardless of location, platform or operational partner.

4.9 Infrastructure projects underpin all future NEC developments so there is a need
for such projects to progress ahead of, or in parallel with, the C2 equipment and
or sensor system projects. In recognition of this requirement the NZDF is
intending to initiate projects that will deal with network architecture, fixed
networks, and mobile access to a range of broadband communications systems.
Such projects include Joint Communications Modernisation and NZDF Satellite
Communications Capability. Collectively, these projects when completed will
deliver a modern global communications system which is estimated to cost
around $100 million to be implemented over the next 5 to 10 years.

4.10 The NZDF also needs to be able to collate, process, and disseminate a wide
range of information as rapidly and securely as possible. Collectively, the NZDF
has characterised this processing system as the Joint Command and Control
System (JCCS). A programme of work to implement JCCS is currently being
developed and will be based on discrete components. Whilst the core component
will be the C2 system, the collective components will enable the NZDF to process
and disseminate information quickly. The JCCS Programme is expected to take
up to five years to implement at an estimated cost of $35 - $55 million.

4.11 In parallel with the infrastructure projects and the JCCS programme, systems will
be developed that will enable information to be processed and analysed. Such
systems include, or are a part of, the following projects:

    - P-3 Mission Management, Communication, and Navigation Systems
Upgrades;

    - ANZAC Class Self Defence Upgrade; and

    - Land Command & Control, Communications, Computers, Intelligence,
Surveillance, and Reconnaissance.

###### Description


###### Photo of Royal New Zealand Air Force Boeing 757.


5.1 This project replaced the Boeing 727 aircraft with the Boeing 757 aircraft, which
have a greater range and payload capacity.

###### Policy Value

5.2 A strategic air transport capability is a critical enabler for many operations and has
a high degree of utility across all of the Government's defence policy objectives.

###### Capability Gaps

5.3 In addition to the C-130s, New Zealand requires a strategic airlift capability
provided by jet transport aircraft. This was previously provided by two Boeing 727
aircraft and is now provided by two Boeing 757 aircraft.

5.4 The capability provides essential air transport for the deployment of NZDF
personnel and equipment within New Zealand, to the South Pacific, Australia, the
Asia-Pacific region and globally.

###### Links to other Capabilities

5.5 This project has links to the following projects and capabilities:

    - Boeing 757 Modification

###### Current Status

5.6 The two Boeing 757 aircraft have been introduced into service. To meet the
Government's policy requirements, they are currently being modified in a
combination freight/passenger configuration and will be re-introduced into service
when completed (see also page 24).


-----

###### Timing

5.7 The replacement project was completed in 2005.

###### Costs

5.8 The total purchase price for the Boeing 757 fleet was $108.3 million.

5.11 The lease on the former Defence building expired and the Defence organisations
were required to relocate.

###### Current Status

5.12 Staff relocated to the new premises in February 2007.

###### Timing

5.13 Building construction commenced in August 2004. The fit out was completed in
early 2007.

###### Costs

5.14 The fit out project cost around $22 million. The initial lease term is 18 years.
Whole-of-life costs are estimated to be around $140 million.

#### Medium Range Anti-Armour Weapon Photo of New Zealand Javelin detachment in action in Waiouru.

_New Zealand Javelin detachment in action in Waiouru_

###### Description

5.15 This project provides protection for New Zealand's land forces from armoured
threats.

###### Policy Value

5.16 The Medium Range Anti-Armour Weapon (MRAAW) provides land forces with a
medium-range capability against armoured vehicles and other targets. It is a
critical part of any contribution to operations where land forces may face an
armoured vehicle threat. The MRAAW also has some utility in peacekeeping
operations in the Asia-Pacific region and globally for self-protection in the event of
an escalation in the threat to ground forces.

###### Capability Gap

5.17 The Army only had a short-range anti-armour weapon that was limited in range
and lethality. New Zealand land forces were very vulnerable to threats from tanks,
armoured vehicles or other anti-armour weapons. There was a need for a
capability to engage these threats at the greatest distance practicable.

###### Links to other Capabilities

5.18 This project has links to the following projects and capabilities:

    - Light Armoured Vehicle

    - Light Operational Vehicle

    - Direct Fire Support Weapon

    - Land Command & Control, Communications, Computers, Intelligence,
Surveillance, and Reconnaissance

    - Night Vision Equipment


-----

###### Current Status

5.19 A Life Cycle Contractor Support Agreement is under negotiation.

###### Timing

5.20 Project components including weapons, equipment and ammunition have been
delivered and the systems have been introduced into service. Delivery was
completed in December 2006.

###### Costs

5.21 This project cost around $24 million. The estimated life is around 15 years.
Whole-of-life costs are estimated to be around $45 million.


-----

#### Very Low Level Air Defence Cueing System

###### Description

5.22 This project involves the purchase of additional equipment to bring the Mistral air
defence system up to operational standard.

###### Policy Value

5.23 An air defence capability is necessary to protect critical land force elements from
air threats such as low flying aircraft and armed helicopters.

###### Capability Gap

5.24 The very low level air defence system acquired in the 1990’s was not fully
operational as target detection, identification and tracking relied on visual
observation. To be fully effective and minimise risk to friendly aircraft, this project
has delivered an auto cueing and identification friend or foe capability.

###### Links to other Capabilities

5.25 This project has links to the following projects and capabilities:

#### Multi-Role Vessel Photo of New Zealand Light Armoured Vehicle (LAV) disembarking the HMNZS Canterbury.

###### Description


P hoto of the HMNZS Canterbury.

_HMNZS Canterbury_


5.37 The Multi-Role Vessel (MRV), HMNZS Canterbury, provides a tactical sealift and
amphibious capability for the NZDF. The MRV’s design also allows for a strategic
sealift capability by way of a port to port capability. The MRV acquisition is part of
Project Protector, which also involves the acquisition of two offshore patrol
vessels and four inshore patrol vessels (see also page 26).

###### Policy Value

5.38 The MRV will be used primarily in the South Pacific and the Asia-Pacific region for
peace support operations, evacuation of personnel during civil emergencies, and
disaster relief. A tactical sealift capability to off-load people and equipment both
day and night without access to a port facility increases the utility of the MRV.

5.39 The MRV will be able to undertake patrol and presence operations in New
Zealand's Exclusive Economic Zone and the South Pacific, and will provide the
Government with an additional option for regional commitments such as the Five
Power Defence Arrangements and for global deployments. The MRV will provide
additional berths for sea training purposes.

###### Capability Gap

5.40 Previously, the NZDF had no tactical sealift capability nor could it easily deploy
land force personnel and their equipment, including helicopter support, into areas
without port facilities. Tactical sealift vessels cannot be chartered. The MRV will
provide an independent tactical sealift capability, able to deploy to peace support
operations; evacuate our nationals from trouble spots; and contribute to regional
disaster relief and humanitarian assistance.

5.41 In conjunction with the frigates and the offshore patrol vessels, the MRV will also
provide additional capacity for tasks such as patrolling, sea training, support to
land operations, and defence diplomacy.

###### Description


###### Photo of an IEDD capability demonstration.


5.46 This project provides an enhanced national Improvised Explosive Device Disposal
(IEDD) capability and a credible Improvised Explosive Device Disposal Chemical, Biological and Radiological (IEDD-CBR) capability.

###### Policy Value

5.47 An IEDD and IEDD-CBR capability is part of the NZDF's role to counter threats
posed by terrorism or acts of sabotage. The NZDF IEDD capability is an essential
component of the wider whole-of-government approach to an IEDD or IEDD-CBR
emergency, managed by the New Zealand Police. The potential consequences of
IEDD incidents range from limited but costly, inconvenience and disruption of
activities through to the loss of life.

###### Capability Gap

5.48 The NZDF’s previous IEDD capability was derived from the skills of Ammunition
Technical Officers. These personnel had limited training for extreme
circumstances and limited equipment. The types of terrorist threats that now exist
require more capable and effective responses.

###### Links to other Capabilities

_Inshore Patrol Vessel HMNZS Rotoiti_


6.9 This project involves the acquisition of two offshore and four inshore patrol
vessels to meet requirements for maritime surface surveillance in New Zealand's
Exclusive Economic Zone (EEZ), the Ross Sea and the South Pacific.

###### Policy Value

6.10 Patrol vessels are an important element in the surveillance of New Zealand's EEZ
and other maritime areas of interest. They will work in conjunction with the P-3
airborne surveillance and reconnaissance force to protect natural resources and
detect and deter maritime transnational threats.

6.11 The patrol vessels will meet many government agencies' needs, including the
Ministry of Fisheries, the New Zealand Customs Service, the Department of
Conservation, the Police, Maritime New Zealand and others. The offshore patrol
vessels will be able to support maritime counter-terrorism operations and provide
a presence in the South Pacific to support peace and stability and help with
disaster relief.

###### Capability Gap

6.12 New Zealand currently has a very limited maritime surface patrol capability
provided by the two frigates and that inherent in the various specialised vessels.

#### P-3 Mission Management, Communication, and Navigation Systems Upgrades

_P-3K Orion flying on a routine patrol of the New Zealand coast_

###### Description

6.23 This project will upgrade the mission management, communications, and
navigation systems for the P-3 Orion airborne surveillance and reconnaissance
aircraft.

###### Policy Value


_Photo of P-3K Orion flying on a routine patrol of the New Zealand coast._


6.24 The capability provided by the P-3 Orion is central to the NZDF meeting the
Government’s five defence policy objectives and a broad spectrum of civilian roles
and tasks. The P-3 Orion airborne surveillance and reconnaissance force
undertakes surveillance of New Zealand's Exclusive Economic Zone (EEZ) and
the Southern Ocean; meets our South Pacific search and rescue obligations; and
provides surveillance assistance to South Pacific nations.

6.25 The P-3 Orion is one of the primary force elements contributing to our defence
relationships with Australia and Five Power Defence Arrangements (FPDA)
partners.

###### Capability Gap

6.26 The obsolescent systems onboard the P-3 Orions limited the availability of
surveillance flights and other missions due to repeated equipment failures.
Without an upgrade, the NZDF would be increasingly unable to meet Government
objectives for the EEZ and Southern Ocean surveillance and assisting South
Pacific countries with surveillance of their EEZs. There could also be difficulties in
meeting wider commitments to Australia and FPDA partners.

    - P-3 Self-Protection

    - ANZAC Class Self-Defence Upgrade

###### Current Status

6.28 Upgrade work on the aircraft is underway.

###### Timing

6.29 In October 2004, a contract was awarded to L-3 Communications Integrated
Systems of the USA as the prime contractor for the project. Development of the
prototype aircraft is underway in the USA. The other five P-3 Orion aircraft will be
upgraded in Blenheim, New Zealand in association with Safe Air Ltd.

6.30 The first upgraded aircraft is scheduled to be delivered in 2009, with fleet
modernisation expected to be completed in 2011.

###### Costs

6.31 This project is expected to cost around $373 million. The P-3 fleet is scheduled to
serve until around 2025. Whole-of-life costs are to be confirmed.

_C-130 Hercules_


6.32 This project will extend the life of the C-130 aircraft by upgrading the avionics and
self protections systems as well as undertaking some structural refurbishment
work.

###### Policy Value

6.33 The C-130 is a critical enabler for many NZDF operations. The C-130 has
particular utility where runways are short or in poor condition. It provides
essential air transport for the deployment of NZDF personnel and equipment
within New Zealand, to the South Pacific, Australia, the Asia-Pacific region and
globally. Air transport is a critical capability across a spectrum of military
operations including: supporting counter-terrorist operations; peace-support
operations; evacuations of New Zealanders from trouble spots; disaster relief and
humanitarian operations; undertaking tasks within New Zealand; and supporting
New Zealand's Antarctic programme.

###### Capability Gaps

6.34 The declining availability of C-130 air transport presented a major capability gap
that would have impacted on the NZDF's ability to deploy and support personnel.
If this project was not carried out, the NZDF would have insufficient air transport
to support deployments or to perform other tasks. This situation would lead to a
risk of policy failure, particularly in the New Zealand, South Pacific, and AsiaPacific contexts.

#### NZDF Medium Utility Helicopter Capability

_NH90 helicopter_

###### Description

6.39 This project will replace the Iroquois utility helicopters with the NH90.

###### Policy Value


###### Photo of NH90 helicopter.


6.40 Utility helicopters provide essential support to the Army, particularly in the South
Pacific and in peace support operations. Helicopters are also important for
supporting police operations, counter terrorism operations and for providing a
range of support functions within New Zealand and the South Pacific, such as
search and rescue, and disaster relief.

6.41 The introduction into service of HMNZS Canterbury has created an additional role
for utility helicopters in supporting the lodgement of personnel by amphibious
means, especially in the South Pacific.

###### Capability Gap

6.42 The current helicopter fleet is unable to meet the contemporary and future
requirements of a modern, mobile land force. The UH-1H Iroquois helicopter is
becoming increasingly difficult to support because of its age. With helicopters
assuming greater importance for mobility and tasks in peace support operations,
there is a risk that the NZDF will be unable to adequately perform its roles and
tasks if the Iroquois were not replaced with a medium utility helicopter capability.

###### Links to other Capabilities

6.43 This project has links to the following projects and capabilities:

    - NZDF Training / Light Utility Helicopter Capability

#### Ohakea Base Taxiways Reconstruction

###### Description

6.55 This project will reconstruct the Ohakea Base Taxiways 'A' and 'C' and their
associated hard standings to keep the airfield fully operational for military and
commercial use and ensure that the airfield meets International Civil Aviation
Organisation (ICAO) standards.

###### Policy Value

6.56 The reconstructed taxiways will support the operation of maritime surveillance
aircraft, air transport aircraft, helicopters, and flying training aircraft at Ohakea.

###### Capability Gap

6.57 The taxiways have reached a stage where their use by larger aircraft is limited. In
particular, the taxiways are no longer suitable for routine operation of jet transport
aircraft. Restrictions on aircraft operations at Ohakea affect the ability of the Air
Force to operate effectively. There is also an impact on the base's ability to
handle and accommodate civil aircraft when required as a diversion airfield.

###### Links to Other Capabilities

6.58 This project has links to the following projects and capabilities:

    - Ohakea Runway Reconstruction (now completed)

    - Ohakea Essential Infrastructure Programme

    - P-3 Mission Management, Communication, and Navigation Systems
Upgrades

    - C-130 Life Extension

    - Boeing 757 Modification

    - Advanced Pilot Training Capability

###### Current Status

6.59 To avoid having two projects running at the same time, Taxiway C will be
completed before the construction of the facilities for the NH90 helicopters
commences. To meet this constraint and allow the bulk earth works to be
completed during the summer construction period, Taxiway C work commenced
in December 2007, with completion targeted for late 2008. The Taxiway A work
will occur during 2010/11.

###### Timing 

6.60 Taxiway C works will be completed in late 2008 and the design for Taxiway A will
commence in 2010.

###### Costs

6.61 This project is expected to cost around $18 million. The estimated life of the
taxiways is 50 years.

#### Replacement of Devonport Naval Base 60Hz Power Generation and Reticulation

_Devonport Naval Base_

###### Description


###### Aerial photo of the Devonport Naval Base.


6.62 This project is upgrading the 60 hertz (Hz) power generation and reticulation
system at the Devonport Naval Base.

###### Policy Value

6.63 All Royal New Zealand Navy ships are equipped with an onboard capacity to
generate 60Hz power. When berthed, it is highly desirable for this power to be
generated independently using a shore-based system. Not proceeding with the
upgrade of the 60Hz power generation and reticulation system at the Devonport
Naval Base would have made it very difficult for the Navy to maintain its current
fleet and Project Protector vessels at the level required to meet the Government's
defence policy objectives.

###### Capability Gap

6.64 The Devonport Naval Base was equipped with a generation and reticulation
system that converted 50Hz power supplied from the national grid to 60Hz. The
infrastructure was old and unable to fully support the existing fleet. For example,
each ANZAC frigate consumed half the total output. Temporary generating
capacity was hired at considerable cost whenever a high proportion of the fleet
was berthed at Devonport. A modernised generation and reticulation system was
needed with the arrival of the Project Protector vessels.

#### Replacement of Devonport Naval Base Fuel Installation Facilities

###### Description

6.69 This project is rationalising and modernising the marine fuel installation (storage,
defueling and bilge cleaning capabilities) at the Devonport Naval Base.

###### Policy Value

6.70 The Naval Fuel Installation provides an essential strategic fuel storage capability
to enable the Navy to condition and distribute the correct fuel to its ships. This has
added significance with the arrival of the Project Protector vessels.

###### Capability Gap

6.71 After the decommissioning of the original fuel bunker tunnels which had become
obsolescent, the Navy's fuelling arrangements in Auckland have been provided
through a commercial supply and waste product disposal contract. HMNZS
_Endeavour has also been utilised when available._

6.72 The loss of the bunkers has affected the Navy’s ability to hold contingency
reserves and operational stocks and control the quality of marine fuel. It is also
unable to defuel vessels when required.

###### Links to other Capabilities

6.73 This project has links to the following projects and capabilities:

    - Multi-Role Vessel

    - Patrol Vessels

    - ANZAC Class Self-Defence Upgrade

###### Current Status

6.74 The construction of modernised facilities is underway.

###### Timing

6.75 This project will be completed in 2009.

###### Costs

6.76 The project is expected to cost around $15 million. The estimated life is around
50 years. Whole-of-life costs are to be confirmed.

#### C-130 Self-Protection

###### Description


###### Photo of C-130 Hercules.


_C-130 Hercules_


6.77 This project is upgrading the C-130 Hercules self-protection system to provide the
ability to detect and counter likely threats, primarily man-portable infrared (IR)
missiles.

###### Policy Value

6.78 The C-130 Hercules is a critical enabler for many NZDF operations. It provides
essential air transport for a number of roles and tasks, including supporting
counter-terrorist operations, peace support operations, and evacuations of New
Zealanders from trouble spots. These operations may involve the C-130s landing
in locations where there is the threat of hostile air defence weapons. In places
such as Afghanistan, coalition forces expect aircraft to operate with an effective
standard of self-protection.

6.79 C-130s and their crews are high value assets. They carry mission critical cargo
and personnel. It is therefore important to protect those assets and minimise the
risks to personnel and to payloads.

###### Capability Gaps

6.80 The current C-130 self-protection fit was installed in the early 1990s. Since that
time there has been a significant increase in the sophistication, availability and
employment of missiles by combat forces, terrorists and other non-government
actors in a range of operating environments. The current system is therefore no
longer appropriate for today's threat environment.


-----

6.81 In recent years, the majority of fixed wing aircraft lost to hostile fire in unstable
regions of the world have fallen to IR guided man portable missile systems.
These shoulder-launched systems have proliferated widely across the globe. Lack
of an effective self-protection capability could therefore limit the use of our C-130s
in humanitarian or peace support operations globally.

###### Links to Other Capabilities

6.82 This project has links to the following projects and capabilities:

    - P-3 Self-Protection

    - C-130 Life Extension

###### Current Status

6.83 Modification to the first aircraft is underway. The first C-130 with an upgraded self
protection system is scheduled to be delivered in 2009 and be operational in the
same year.

###### Timing

6.84 This project is underway and is being completed in conjunction with the C-130
Life Extension.

###### Costs

6.85 This project is expected to cost around $21 million. The C-130 fleet is scheduled
to serve until around 2017. Whole-of-life costs are estimated to be around $30
million.

#### ANZAC Class Close-In Weapon System Upgrade and Refurbishment

###### Description

6.86 This project upgrades the ANZAC Class Phalanx Close-In Weapon System
(CIWS), the last line of defence and protection from Anti-Ship Missiles (ASM) and
strike aircraft. It also has the potential to defend against Fast Inshore Attack Craft
(FIAC).

###### Policy Value

6.87 The ANZAC Class Frigates must be able to operate in environments where there
is a risk of attack from ASM and FIAC. To be able to operate in such
environments without undue risk or constraint, the frigates must be equipped with
a level of self-defence against such threats. The CIWS provides a substantial
proportion of this self-defence capability.

###### Capability Gaps

6.88 The CIWS systems require refurbishment to rectify capability shortfalls, and will
be upgraded to counter advances in the ASM threat and increasing risk of FIAC
attacks.

###### Links to other Capabilities

6.89 This project has links to the following projects and capabilities:

    - ANZAC Class Self-Defence Upgrade

###### Current Status

6.90 This project is underway.

###### Policy Value

6.95 A modern training helicopter is critical to transition pilots and crew to the NH90
medium utility helicopters and the Navy's SH-2G Seasprite helicopters. In a light
utility role, the T/LUH helicopters will support a range of government and civil
agencies in New Zealand and offshore.

###### Capability Gap

6.96 The Sioux training helicopter is of 1950s vintage and is inadequate to meet
contemporary training needs. It does not provide an adequate step in pilot training
progression from the basic CT4E Airtrainer aircraft to utility and maritime
helicopters, nor does it contribute to the training of other helicopter aircrew.

6.97 The acquisition of the NH90 medium utility helicopter creates a requirement for a
complementary light utility helicopter capability not met by the Sioux training
helicopter.

###### Links to other Capabilities

-----

#### Night Vision Equipment

###### Description

6.102 This project involves the purchase of Night Vision Equipment (NVE) for NZDF
force elements to operate and train effectively at night or in conditions of reduced
light.

###### Policy Value

6.103 NVE assists in meeting a range of the Government's defence policy objectives.
NVE enhances safety and force protection for NZDF force elements through
improved situational awareness. NVE provides an important enabling capability
for the Army, Navy and Air Force to operate and train at night or in conditions of
reduced light.

###### Capability Gap

6.104 The NZDF possessed a limited night operating capability. Recent major capital
acquisitions such as the Light Armoured Vehicle, NH90 Medium Utility Helicopter
and A109 Training / Light Utility Helicopters, the C-130 Life Extension, Multi-Role
Vessel and Medium Range Anti-Armour Weapon have seen platforms being
acquired that either contain advanced night operating capabilities, or could realise
a significant increase in capability with the addition of NVE.

6.105 This project includes the following systems:

    - Individual NVE such as night vision goggles

    - Night weapons sights for both personal and crew served weapons

    - Hand held observation devices

###### Description

7.1 This project will maintain the ability to conduct advanced pilot training after the
expiry of the present B200 King Air lease.

###### Policy Value

7.2 RNZAF pilot training is a core enabling capability for all our operations. The
Advanced Pilot Training Capability (APTC) is critical to graduate pilots for the Air
Force and Navy with the skills needed for transition to the upgraded and new
operational aircraft of the NZDF. The replacement APTC will provide a multiengine platform that bridges the skill gap, aircraft performance and cockpit
technology between the basic CT4E Airtrainer aircraft and the larger, more
complex force element aircraft.

###### Capability Gap

7.3 With the upgraded and new aircraft delivering ‘state of the art’ systems presented
in ‘glass cockpits’, there is an ongoing requirement for multi-engined advanced
pilot training on systems with appropriate technology and complexity. The
capability includes a requirement for a flight training device.

#### ANZAC Class Platform Systems Upgrade

_Machinery Control Room_

###### Description


Photo of Machinery Control Room.


7.8 This project seeks to ensure that ANZAC class platform systems remain viable.
Platform systems, as distinct from combat systems, provide those elements of a
warship's capability that enable it to move, float, generate power, recover from
damage, and accommodate people.

###### Policy Value

7.9 A platform systems refit is required to ensure that the ANZACs remain capable of
meeting policy objectives. The role of the Naval Combat Force is to meet military
tasks, particularly in support of the Government's regional and global objectives.
The ANZACs are critical to the protection of Australia/New Zealand territorial
sovereignty, for participating in Five Power Defence Arrangements activities,
supporting our relationships with regional partners, and undertaking peace
support operations in the Asia-Pacific region and beyond.

###### Capability Gap

7.10 Equipment obsolescence, tighter environmental legislation and manpower
constraints drive the need for a platform systems upgrade. The project involves
upgrading the existing propulsion systems, and heating, ventilation and airconditioning systems, as well as modifications to the hull. A replacement
machinery control system will reduce technical manpower needs.

###### Links to other Capabilities

7.11 This project has links to the following projects and capabilities:

    - ANZAC Class Self-Defence Upgrade

    - ANZAC Class Close-in Weapon System Upgrade and Refurbishment

#### Joint Command and Control System 

###### Description

7.15 This programme is intended to implement an information technology enabled
command and control system for the NZDF. This system will collect, collate,
process, display, store, disseminate and protect command and control information
in near real-time.

7.16 This programme is being progressed through four sub-component projects
Defence Command and Control System, Logistics, Air Command and Control,
and Joint Military Appreciation Process.

###### Policy Value

7.17 A modern Joint Command and Control System (JCCS) is a key enabling
capability for meeting all of the policy roles and tasks required of the NZDF. A
JCCS will enable force elements from all three Services to work together
efficiently and effectively by enhancing their situational awareness and decisionmaking processes.

###### Capability Gap

7.18 The NZDF's current command and control systems are largely manual and paper
based. NZDF experience in recent operations and military exercises has shown
that the current command and control systems are obsolete and inefficient. This
has impacted on the effectiveness of the Joint Force Headquarters. The slower
and less accurate decision making cycle currently available to commanders is
likely to lead to policy failure as it becomes increasingly difficult for the NZDF to
plan and effectively coordinate operations.

###### Links to Other Capabilities

7.19 The JCCS is an overarching capability that contributes to all NZDF outputs by
giving the NZDF the ability to manage all forms of command and control
information. The components of JCCS will utilise current NZDF communications
systems and networks to transfer data. Linked projects are:

    - Joint Communication Modernisation

    - Land Command & Control, Communications, Computers, Intelligence,
Surveillance, and Reconnaissance

    - P-3 Mission Management, Communication, and Navigation System Upgrades

    - NZDF Satellite Communications Capability

###### Current Status

7.20 Business cases are being developed for the Government’s consideration in
2008/09/10.


-----

###### Timing

7.21 It is expected that JCCS will be phased into-service over the period 2009 – 2014.

###### Costs

7.22 This project is expected to cost between $35 - $55 million. Whole-of-life costs are
estimated to be around $15.5 million annually from 2012.

#### ANZAC Class Self-Defence Upgrade Photo of HMNZS Te Mana.

_HMNZS Te Mana_

###### Description

7.30 This project proposes to upgrade the ANZAC Class self-defence systems to
protect the Naval Combat Force, and ships under its immediate protection from
increasingly sophisticated anti-ship systems, and to address equipment
obsolescence.

###### Policy Value

7.31 The role of the Naval Combat Force is to meet military tasks in support of the
Government's regional and global objectives. The ANZACs are critical to the
protection of Australian/New Zealand territorial sovereignty, for participating in
Five Power Defence Arrangements activities, supporting our relationships with
regional partners, and undertaking peace support and maritime interdiction
operations in the Asia-Pacific region and beyond. These environments contain
significantly higher threats to surface vessels, including air and sub-surface
threats, when compared with New Zealand's immediate area. To continue
operating in these environments at an acceptable level of risk, and therefore meet
the Government's policy requirements, the ANZACs will require an upgrade to
their defensive systems to meet the changing threat levels in these areas.

###### Capability Gap

7.32 By the end of the decade, the increase in air, surface and sub-surface threats,
and the sophistication of these threats, within the Australia/Asia-Pacific region and
beyond, will mean that the ANZACs defensive systems will become increasingly
ineffective. Consequently, the operational capability of the ANZACs will decline to
the point where operating in these environments would carry serious risks.


-----

7.33 The design of the majority of self-defence equipment on the ANZACs will be
approaching 25 years of age by 2010. Support will become increasingly difficult
and operating costs will rise. In some cases, such as the anti-air missile, existing
systems are becoming increasingly difficult to support.

###### Links to other Capabilities

7.34 This project has links to the following projects and capabilities:

    - P-3 Air-to-Surface Weapon

    - ANZAC Class Close-in Weapon System Upgrade and Refurbishment

    - ANZAC Class Platform Systems Upgrade

    - Multi-Role Vessel

    - P-3 Mission Management, Communication, and Navigation Systems

### 8. Projects Critical to Avoid the Failure of Policy

#### Joint Communications Modernisation

###### Description

8.1 This project proposes to modernise the NZDF's long-range and medium-range
communications capability to maintain a reliable, integrated, world-wide
communications infrastructure.

8.2 The modernisation will support higher data transfer rates and modern
communication protocols, with a mix of military and commercial communications
services.

###### Policy Value

8.3 As communication is critical, the modernisation of the communications
infrastructure is important in the achievement of defence policy objectives in New
Zealand's environs, the South Pacific, the Asia-Pacific region and potentially in
contributions to global security and peacekeeping. This proposed
communications infrastructure will support NZDF deployed forces, ships and
aircraft operating outside short-range radio coverage and enable communications
between force elements deployed to different parts of a theatre of operations.

###### Capability Gap

8.4 Current communications systems are Single Service oriented, technologically
dated, and comprise ad-hoc and short-term systems. The communications
systems currently available between the Joint Force Headquarters and units
deployed or operating beyond short-range radio coverage will not meet future
requirements, resulting in an inability to exchange information between NZDF
units and allies. Deferral of this project will limit the type and timeliness of
information that can be exchanged. Thus it will limit the ability of the NZDF to
develop a modern, integrated command and control, communications, and
intelligence capability.

###### Links to Other Capabilities

8.5 Long-range and medium-range communication systems form an essential part of
the NZDF communications infrastructure and contribute to all NZDF outputs.
Linked projects are:

    - Joint Command and Control Systems

    - Land Command & Control, Communications, Computers, Intelligence,
Surveillance, and Reconnaissance

    - NZDF Satellite Communications Capability

###### Current Status

8.6 A preliminary study is underway to scope the programme of work required to
achieve an integrated communications infrastructure.


-----

###### Timing

8.7 Components of this project are scheduled for acquisition from around 2010.

###### Costs

8.8 This project has an indicative cost of between $40 - $60 million. Whole-of-life
costs are not yet able to be calculated.


-----

#### Land Command & Control, Communications, Computers, Intelligence, Surveillance, and Reconnaissance 

###### Description 

8.9 This project proposes to acquire an improved Land Command and Control,
Communications, Computers, Intelligence, Surveillance, and Reconnaissance
(Land C4ISR) capability to support the Command and Control of deployed land
forces; and provide an enhanced ability to support the Intelligence, Surveillance
and Reconnaissance (ISR) needs of the NZDF in the land environment.

8.10 The capability will comprise a land ISR system that will collect and analyse
battlefield information. It will also provide a tactical battlefield Command and
Control (C2) system (with its supporting deployable communications) providing
commanders with improved situational awareness, messaging ability, a common
operating picture, collaborative planning tools, and enhanced communications.

8.11 Two LTDP projects have been combined, the Land Intelligence, Surveillance and
Reconnaissance (ISR) and the Tactical C4 project with the Army Tactical Trunk
Communications project to form the Land C4ISR project

###### Policy Value 

8.12 Land C4ISR is a key enabler of the Army’s Network Enabled Army Concept and
will provide the deployable land component of the NZDF’s Network Enabled
Capability. An improved Land C4ISR capability will enhance the situational
awareness, command and control, and interoperability of deployed NZDF Land
Forces in military operations.

###### Capability Gap 

8.13 Presently the Army does not at have an integrated tactical C2 system nor does it
have an integrated Land ISR system although discrete components of both do
exist.

###### Links to other Capabilities 

8.14 This project has links to the following projects and capabilities:

### 9. Projects Essential to Avoid the Failure of Policy

#### P-3 Self-Protection

###### Description

9.1 This project proposes to equip the P-3 with a self-protection capability to counter
likely threats, primarily man-portable infrared (IR) missiles.

###### Policy Value

9.2 The P-3 Orion airborne surveillance and reconnaissance force undertakes
surveillance of New Zealand's Exclusive Economic Zone and the Southern
Ocean, meets our South Pacific search and rescue obligations, and provides
surveillance assistance to South Pacific nations. The P-3 Orion has a high utility
for a wide range of civilian and military operations. It is one of the primary force
elements contributing to our defence relationships with Australia and Five Power
Defence Arrangements partners. The P-3 Orion also has high utility as a niche
contribution to global security operations.

9.3 P-3s are high value assets and can carry up to 21 people. It is important to protect
those assets and minimise the risks to people onboard.

9.4 The upgraded P-3 Orion will be able to support international partners in a broader
range of environments.

###### Capability Gaps

9.5 In recent years the majority of fixed wing aircraft lost to hostile fire has been to IR
guided man-portable missile systems. These shoulder-launched systems have
proliferated widely across the globe. Lack of an effective self protection capability
could therefore limit the use of our P-3s globally.

9.6 The P-3 currently has no dedicated self-protection equipment. The aircraft's
sensors inherently provide some early warning of long-range threats. However,
man-portable missiles are difficult to detect and locate other than by sensing the
signature produced by their motor burn. It is essential that these missiles are
detected at launch and that appropriate countermeasures are used to defeat
them.

###### Links to Other Capabilities

9.7 This project has links to the following projects and capabilities:

    - C-130 Self-Protection

    - P-3 Mission Management, Communication, and Navigation Systems
Upgrades

9.9 It is intended that the self-protection equipment be fitted as soon as practicable
after the delivery of the upgraded P-3 fleet from around 2011.

###### Costs

9.10 The indicative project cost is in the range of $30 - 40 million. Whole-of-life costs
are not yet able to be calculated.


-----

#### Land Transport Capability Programme

###### Description

9.11 Formerly known as the General Service Vehicle Replacement project, this
programme will replace the NZDF’s general service vehicle fleet, including
medium and heavy vehicles, trailers and mechanical handling equipment. It will
be an integrated vehicle system that may include associated weapons,
communications, protection and night driving capabilities.

###### Policy Value

9.12 The general service vehicle fleet is a critical enabler for land force operations.
This fleet sustains and resupplies forces with fuel, ammunition, rations, personnel
and spares and provides maintenance support. The fleet has utility in meeting a
wide range of policy objectives.

###### Capability Gap

9.13 The current fleet of vehicles is approaching 25 years of age and is reaching the
end of its economic life.

9.14 The current fleet is not well matched to meet the Army’s contemporary and future
requirements. The majority of the fleet is cross country capable but has a limited
payload of four tonnes. The vehicles have no armoured protection or self
protection, and no integrated command and control or communication systems.
The heavy vehicle component of the current fleet has a payload of eight tonnes
but is not cross country capable.

###### Links to other Capabilities

9.15 This project has links to the following projects and capabilities:

    - Light Operational Vehicles

    - Multi-Role Vessel

    - Combat Service Support Vehicles

    - Land Command & Control, Communications, Computers, Intelligence,
Surveillance, and Reconnaissance

    - Night Vision Equipment

    - Light Armoured Vehicles

###### Current Status

9.16 Preliminary work is underway within Defence to scope this project.


-----

###### Timing

9.17 A progressive vehicle replacement programme is expected to begin from 2011.

###### Costs

9.18 The indicative cost of this project is around $550 – 600 million. Whole-of-life costs
are not yet able to be calculated.

### 10. Projects Necessary to Avoid the Failure of Policy

#### P-3 Air-to-Surface Weapons

###### Description

10.1 This project proposes to equip the P-3 aircraft with an air-to-surface weapon
capability.

###### Policy Value

10.2 Equipping the P-3 aircraft with an air-to-surface weapon capability would
significantly enhance the value of these aircraft in fulfilling policy roles relating to
the territorial sovereignty of New Zealand and Australia, play an appropriate role
in the maintenance of security in the Asia-Pacific region, and participating in Five
Power Defence Arrangements.

###### Capability Gap

10.3 The P-3 provides targeting information but does not have an air-to-surface
weapon capability. The inability to take immediate action against surface threats
limits the P-3’s ability to provide force protection for New Zealand naval vessels,
particularly the ANZACs, Multi-Role Vessel and Patrol Vessels. This deficiency
applies equally across the open ocean and littoral environments.

###### Links to other Capabilities

10.4 This project has links to the following projects and capabilities:

    - P-3 Mission Management, Communication, and Navigation Systems
Upgrades

    - Multi-Role Vessel

###### Timing

10.6 The timing of this project is dependent on the completion of the P-3 mission
systems upgrade and needs to be considered in coordination with the P-3 SelfProtection project to ensure the availability of aircraft for operational tasking.

###### Costs

10.7 The indicative cost of this project is around $35 - 45 million. Whole-of-life costs
are not yet able to be calculated.


-----

#### NZDF Torpedo Replacement

###### Description

10.8 This project proposes to replace the torpedoes for the ANZAC frigates, P-3 Orions
and SH-2G Seasprite helicopters to maintain the ANZACs basic self-defence and
the P-3s capability against sub-surface threats. Together, these help to protect
escorted vessels from sub-surface threats and the P-3s area anti-submarine
capability.

###### Policy Value

10.9 The role of the Naval Combat Force with embarked SH-2G Seasprite Helicopters
is to meet military tasks, in support of the Government's regional and global
objectives. The ANZACs are important to the protection of Australia/New Zealand
territorial sovereignty, for participating in Five Power Defence Arrangements,
supporting our relationships with regional partners, and undertaking peace
support and other operations in the Asia-Pacific and beyond. These
environments contain significantly higher threats to surface vessels than New
Zealand's immediate environs, including air and sub-surface threats. Torpedoes
provide a basic self-defence capability against sub-surface threats, and enable
the ANZACs and other escorted vessels to be safely deployed in these
environments.

10.10 The P-3s require a torpedo replacement to maintain their current capability to fulfil
the above policy roles.

###### Capability Gap

10.11 The current torpedoes are becoming increasingly obsolescent and will reach the
end of their life between 2009 - 2014, increasing the risk to the ANZACs and other
vessels they protect in areas where sub-surface threats may be encountered. The
absence of a torpedo capability would impact on the ability of the NZDF to provide
support for peace enforcement operations and limit the utility of the ANZACs as a
contribution to the protection of New Zealand/Australia territorial sovereignty.

10.12 The absence of a torpedo capability would also mean that the P-3 aircraft would
be unable to contribute to the protection for New Zealand naval or other friendly
vessels against submarine threats.

###### Links to other Capabilities

10.13 This project has links to the following projects and capabilities:

    - ANZAC Class Self-Defence Upgrade

###### Current Status

10.14 Preliminary work is underway within Defence to scope this project. Options to
mitigate the decaying inventory are being investigated. A scoping study is under
development to align this project with the introduction into service of the first
upgraded ANZAC Class Frigate. It is expected that the type of torpedo to replace

current torpedoes in 2012-14.

###### Costs

10.16 The indicative cost of this project is around $70 - 80 million. The estimated life is
about 15 years. Whole-of-life costs are not yet able to be calculated.

#### NZDF Satellite Communications Capability

###### Description

10.17 This project involves the acquisition of a guaranteed secure satellite
communications capability for the NZDF.

###### Policy Value

10.18 Strategic communications in the form of high band-width capability is required to
support NZDF deployments. The NZDF needs to be able to provide guaranteed
secure communications to its operational deployments in a manner which is
interoperable with potential coalition partners, particularly Australia. The NZDF
also needs to be able to provide immediate strategic communications into the
Pacific in support of whole-of-government operations, such as humanitarian
assistance.

###### Capability Gap

10.19 Currently, the NZDF does not have a guaranteed secure strategic
communications capability. To support existing missions, satellite capability is
organised on an ad-hoc basis using commercial or coalition partner satellites.
Neither system is able to guarantee secure, uninterrupted capability. The future
growth of the NZDF's command and control capability will require significantly
more secure band-width than currently utilised.

###### Links to other Capabilities

10.20 Linked projects are:

    - Joint Command and Control Systems

    - P-3 Mission Management, Communication, and Navigation System Upgrades

    - Joint Communications Modernisation

10.23 Capital and operating costs will be dependant on whether lease or purchase
options are selected. More detailed costs will be available once the specifications
have been confirmed. This project is expected to cost between $45 - 65 million.
Whole-of-life costs are not yet able to be calculated.

### 11. Projects that have Benefit but are Less Critical to Achieving Policy Objectives

#### Remote Mine Detection

11.1 The Maritime Forces Review identified a requirement to protect New Zealand's
major ports by developing a capacity to detect and dispose of mines and other
explosives underwater. The Review concluded that the mine countermeasures
role should be retained. The capability of the Navy to detect mine-like objects is
becoming increasingly limited as current equipment approaches the end of its
economic life. Upgrading this capability would significantly improve the safety of
personnel and ships over the current inadequate, emergency only, systems.

#### Indirect Fire Support Weapon

11.2 The Army currently has 81mm mortars and the 105mm artillery howitzer. Both
weapons are expected to require replacement around 2012. A study will be
conducted in due course to determine the appropriate indirect fire support weapon
capability.

#### Infrastructure Projects

11.3 There is a range of infrastructure requirements that will need to be addressed
over the next ten years. These projects will upgrade or replace existing facilities
and may reduce overall infrastructure and operating costs.

### 12. Projects Previously on the LTDP and Moved to the Defence Capital Programme - Minors

#### High Preparedness Infantry Company

###### Description 

12.1 This project, formerly known as the High Readiness Infantry Company project, will
produce a high preparedness force element equipped and trained to meet short
notice security and stability contingencies in the near region. It will allow an
integrated capability to be stood up, addressing the equipment, infrastructure and
personnel policy requirements for maintaining a high preparedness company.

###### Policy Value

12.2 A high preparedness company will provide the NZDF with a land force element
that is equipped and resourced to conduct evacuation, stability and security
operations at short notice.

###### Capability Gap

12.3 The Army does not currently maintain a high preparedness infantry company that
can undertake many short-notice tasks. This represents a policy gap and impacts
on deployment times. The NZDF has met current operational commitments
without a permanent high preparedness force element through the improvisation
of capabilities on a case by case basis, with many of the costs absorbed through
baselines. This practice is generating operational risk in the short term and wider
organisational atrophy in the longer term. The establishment of a high
preparedness infantry company would avoid disrupting personnel numbers in
wider Army units in order to meet short warning contingencies.

###### Links to other Capabilities

12.4 This project has links to the following projects and capabilities:

    - C-130 Life Extension

    - Boeing 757 Modification

    - P-3 Mission Management, Communication, and Navigation Systems
Upgrades

    - Multi-Role Vessel

    - Night Vision Equipment

    - NZDF Weapon Replacement

###### Current Status

12.5 Preliminary work is underway within Defence to scope this project.

###### Timing

12.6 As an initial step a High Preparedness Platoon Group will be developed. A full
High Preparedness Company Group will be generated once the High
Preparedness Platoon has been established.

###### Costs

12.7 This project has not been costed. Whole-of-life costs are not yet able to be
calculated.

#### Army Manoeuvre Range

12.8 A moving target range is a key training enabler for soldiers and commanders to
practice skills necessary to conduct motorised operations. The range allows for
the practice of low-level manoeuvre (up to platoon level) while engaging static and
moving targets. The moving target range has been completed and is being
introduced into service.

#### Army Engineering Equipment

12.9 This project is improving the Army's engineering equipment and therefore its
ability to support mobility of the motorised land force. Equipment includes:

    - Combat engineering tractors (under acquisition)

    - Rapid gap crossing system (under acquisition)

    - Water purification/storage (introduced into service)

#### Combat Service Support Vehicles

12.10 This project is providing additional combat service support vehicles and
associated equipment to support the Light Armoured Vehicles. It has moved into
the acquisition and introduction into service phase.

#### Direct Fire Support Weapon

12.11 The Direct Fire Support Weapon (Area) will provide Army with an automatic
grenade launcher weapon and fire control systems. This project will address a
capability gap in the ability of Army’s light infantry to engage and defeat crew
served weapon systems and area targets with direct fire beyond the range of
section and platoon level automatic weapons. The Direct Fire Support Weapon
(Area) will also contribute to the force protection of convoys and support areas.

#### NZDF Weapon Replacement

12.12 This project will replace or upgrade selected current small arms based weapon
systems and add new weapon systems to the NZDF. The Government has
approved this project and an acquisition strategy is being prepared.
