# Foreword by the Director General of the Estonian Information Board

Dear reader,

Until today, overviews, digests and reports compiled by the EIB
– Estonia’s foreign intelligence service dating back more than
two decades – have been available only to a restricted group
of politicians and officials. Naturally, this will remain the case
for classified documents. ‘International Security and Estonia
in 2016’ is, however the Estonian Information Board’s (EIB)
first publication intended for the public.

The idea for preparing a document describing international
security environment which surrounds Estonia, and is
orientated to the Estonian and foreign public, first occurred as
a response to Russia’s aggression in Ukraine. Not a day went by
in the wake of annexation of Crimea and conflict escalation in
eastern Ukraine without Estonian or foreign press asking: ‘Is
Narva next?’. Not to mention the numerous attempts to analyse
the Kremlin’s hidden agenda with regard to the Baltics. Yet
public officials remained laconic or altogether silent in their
statements resulting in burying the few competent messages
that existed under an avalanche of inadequate information.
This, in return, led to the public space being filled by doomsday
scenarios, half-truths, and with a hunger for sensation.
Without a doubt, such developments have a negative effect on
a nation’s psychological defence. At the same time, Estonia has
its foreign intelligence service whose main task is to ensure
that those with the ‘need to know’ have the best possible
threat assessments at their disposal. With this publication, we
are sharing these assessments with the wider public.

I would like to point out some of the key aspects. Firstly, this
public threat assessment contains information collected and
analysed by the EIB. As such, the assessments therein may
not coincide with those of our partner services in all respects.


**_The main task_**
**_for the EIB is_**
**_to provide best_**
**_possible threat_**
**_assessments to our_**
**_clients._**


-----

That does not mean that our assessments dramatically differ
from those of our closest partners. Secondly, this paper
does not cover every major topic – issues, such as Russian
foreign influence activity, for example, will be left for
another time. Thirdly, although EIB’s assessments tend to be
marked with a seal of state secret, this publication does not
contain declassified material and is not a disclosure of any
state secrets. Moreover, the current paper is not a publicly
disclosed version of a recent classified threat assessment but
is, rather, an entirely new product, specifically created for
the wider public. Fourthly, to pre-empt potential criticism
from experts – this document does not claim a monopoly of
truth. The security environment surrounding Estonia has, in
the recent years, become increasingly dynamic and complex.
Analysis based on open sources may result in assessments
and findings that differ from the ones compiled by the
EIB. Also, as preparing this document took some time, new
pivotal events may have occurred resulting in some of EIB’s
assessments being potentially outdated by the time of its
publication. This document should not be used for making
assessments on the world order in 2026 or 2050 as it focuses
on the most critical events in 2015–2016. Finally, I would like
to emphasize that the EIB is not a policy maker and does not
decide which foreign, defence or other policy steps should
the relevant authorities take based on our assessments.

The main focus of this publication is Russia. This does
not mean that Estonia’s security is solely influenced by its
eastern neighbour or that EIB’s analysis would only focus
on matters concerning Russia. Estonia is organisationally
closely integrated with other nations and naturally shares its
partners’ concerns. Rapidly globalising, increasingly IT based
world has – amongst others – made the definition of security
more ambiguous. Countries are increasingly using non-state
measures and vice versa – non-state actors are trying to act as
states. Events at geographically remote locations, which often
go unnoticed, have a strategic effect on Estonia’s security
context. Still, we opted for such focus since the current policies
practiced by the incumbent Russian government are likely to
remain the sole external power threatening the constitutional
order of the Republic of Estonia in the nearest future. Of
course the previous does not mean that such threats will
necessarily materialise. I kindly ask everyone to read this text

out of context.

# Overview

-  The policies adopted by the current Russian government
will remain the greatest factor threatening the military
security of the Baltic Sea region in the near future. Russia’s
disagreements with the West, growing voluntary isolation,
and unpredictable and aggressive actions in executing its
plans have a profoundly negative effect on the region’s
security.

-  The Russian ruling elite is convinced that, in communication
with the West, Moscow can only defend its interests
from a position of strength, which includes a constant
demonstration of military threats. The Russian leadership
considers NATO’s security reinforcement measures and
the growing number of NATO members as an existential
threat, and views the European Union’s integration policy
as damaging to its interests. This threat assessment was the
basis for the aggression against Georgia and Ukraine: an
attempt to obstruct any Western integration of countries
within the sphere of Russia’s perceived privileged interests,
without any hesitation, and using any means necessary.

-  Despite Russia’s colossal investment in its military
structures over the last decade, its military capability
remains unbalanced. Russia’s capacity to fight using only
conventional means is limited, and the economic crisis it
is facing does not make the situation any easier. Although
unlikely, the use of military power against the Baltic States
cannot be entirely ruled out since conflicts that occur farther
away may spill over to the Baltics. However, deterrence and
defence measures taken by NATO are decreasing the risk of
direct military threats to Estonia, and most of the factors
that made Ukraine susceptible to Russian aggression are not
present in Estonia.

-  Putin’s regime lacks the ideas and willingness to modernise


-----

creating an image of a foreign enemy, and seeking to restore
the country’s Soviet-era might. The Kremlin estimates that
Russia’s grave economic situation can be overcome in a few
years, instilling a belief in the population that the hardships
are temporary and have been caused by outside forces in
order to weaken Russia. However, merely the lifting of
sanctions and a higher oil price will not help Russia emerge
from the crisis; economic revival requires extensive
economic reform.

The present wave of Islamist terrorism is the most extensive
and dangerous the world has encountered. International
terrorism is currently not a significant threat to Estonia,
but it is a risk for Estonian citizens abroad. The greatest
threat to Estonia in terms of Islamist terrorism arises from
radicalised Muslim communities in neighbouring countries
and from returning, radicalised EU citizens who have
participated in jihad in Syria and Iraq.

Since the security situation in the Middle Eastern countries
remains difficult, something which has added significantly
to the ongoing migration crisis, the high level of movement
towards the EU is expected to continue. In the context of
the migration crisis, several European Union Member
States have witnessed a surge in the popularity of farright movements and political parties displaying hostility
towards the EU. This spread of extremist views and increase
in tensions is used skilfully by Russia in order to achieve its
foreign policy aims.

Cyber-attack harming the equipment relying on IT or
crashing critical information infrastructure offers a
relatively cheap and effective way to destabilise a country’s
political and economic environment. The lines between
cyber activists, criminals, and state-paid hackers are
becoming increasingly blurred, and Estonia continues to be
a constant target of cyber-attacks although the intensity of
attacks is now quite low.

# Russia

**Foreign policy**

Relations between Russia and the West are at their worst since the
end of the Cold War. Russia’s eagerness to use military force in order to achieve its foreign and security policy goals has had a serious effect on European security. Moscow’s disputes with the West
and its aggressive implementation of its plans provoke conflicts
that pose a security threat to Europe. Russia has challenged European security principles and aspires to revise the fundamentals
of the global security system. Lack of trust between Russia and
the West results in increased unpredictability in international
relations and escalates the risk of unexpected conflicts.

Since Russian leaders and society share a conservative and
nationalistic mind-set, Russia’s foreign policy will remain
hostile towards the West, even though developing healthy
trade and economic relations would be mutually beneficial.
Russia is trying to portray itself as a civilisational centre with
the right to evolve according to its own values and goals. Any
attempts to criticise Russia’s actions are met with accusations
of Russophobia, which is a frequent justification for uniting
Russians against a common foreign enemy, as well as a tool for
stigmatising Russia’s adversaries.

The Kremlin is convinced that the West (including the Baltic
countries), and especially the US, is secretly working towards
toppling the current leadership of Russia. This approach has led
Russia to interpret many steps taken by the West as interference
in Russia’s domestic affairs or its security interests. Such misinterpretations may cause disproportionately harsh reactions (including military measures) in response to modern civil processes within Russia and its neighbouring countries. This conviction
has led the Kremlin to believe that whilst communicating with
the West Russia can only defend its interests from a position of

Despite Vladimir Putin’s declaration that the collapse of the Soviet Union was the biggest geopolitical catastrophe of the 20th
century, the Kremlin’s goal is not restoration of the Soviet Union.
Using modern political, economic and military instruments
for restoring its sphere of influence is considered a much loftier purpose. Russia’s ambition is to strengthen its influence in
the CIS area and ensure Russian-controlled integration therein
via the Eurasian Union. While considering the Baltic States as
within its area of its vital interests, the Kremlin does not regard
them as it does the CIS countries. Rather, the Baltics are viewed
as an insignificant part of the Western community, and Russia’s
countermeasures towards these countries are often careless and
imprudent compared to its relations with other Western nations.
Since Russia fails to impress as a worthy leader in terms of socalled soft power, it uses aggressive and unpredictable means of
pressure to achieve its foreign policy goals, especially within its
illusory sphere of influence. In order to ensure wider international influence, Russia is seeking support from allies who have
expressed criticism towards the West.

Although Russia is losing its international weight, the main target of its antagonism is the United States. Russia’s ultimate aim
is to get the US to recognise Russia’s regional authority; however,
it lacks any real power to ‘defeat’ the US in global politics. Russia
seeks to control the US by looking for weaknesses in the latter’s
global position, and using these to achieve its geopolitical aims.
For example, Russia skilfully used granting asylum to Edward
Snowden for the purposes of its foreign policy goals. By offering


-----

the US does not care for the values it proclaims (freedom of expression, human rights, etc.) but rather blatantly violates them.

In addition to testing and influencing the US, Russia is using a
multitude of methods in attempts to split cohesion within the
EU and between the EU and the US. Moscow often uses economic
difficulties in EU member states and dependency on Russia’s
energy to incite disagreements within the EU. It also influences
politicians and the public of EU Member States, taking advantage
of their personal interests or lack of awareness of Russia’s true
aims.

Russia’s ruling elite views NATO’s security reinforcement
measures and its growing number of members as an existential
threat, and this threat is magnified by EU’s integration policy –
another aspect said to be hindering Russia’s interests. Prompted
by this threat assessment, Russia without hesitation launched
aggression against both Georgia and Ukraine, seeking to
obstruct any Western integration of countries within its sphere
of interest, and using any means necessary. Russia wants to
replace the NATO-based transatlantic security system with one
where Moscow would have a veto. Russia considers expansion of
NATO’s infrastructure (including its missile shield) to Eastern
Europe and to the Baltics as hostile activity. The Kremlin sees
the entire Baltic area as a foothold from which NATO (led by the
US) can potentially threaten Russia. Hence, Russia will remain
disturbed by the fact that NATO’s borders now meet those of
Russia, with no ‘buffer countries’ between them.

**The Western Military District and Russia’s armed forces**

Despite Russia’s colossal investments over the last decade, its
military capability remains unbalanced. Russia has a limited
military capacity in terms of using conventional means in long
scale conflicts; yet it is this capacity that is especially important
for Russia, considering the country’s geography. Not all conflicts
can simply be solved using nuclear weapons, Special Forces, airborne and information operations, or the Russkiy Mir Foundation.

One of the key constraints of Russian conventional armed forces
is the lack of qualified personnel; particularly trained contractual
servicemen and junior specialists. Manoeuvre brigades of ground
forces are typically capable of assembling only one battalion tactil b i d ith l t l b t ti ll d

are also capable of assembling only a single tactical group. Only
airborne forces and Special Forces are better equipped; around
a third of contractual servicemen there are serving their first
contract term (i.e. they have served in the armed forces for 2–3
years).

The manoeuvre units of the Western Military District’s ground
forces are capable of fielding 13–15 battalion tactical groups,
equivalent to five manoeuvre brigades, fully or mostly staffed
with contractual servicemen who are sufficiently trained to execute combat tasks. Airborne forces are capable of assembling up
to 15 and the naval infantry 2–3 battalion tactical groups.[1]

The Russian reserve units are mostly made up of conscripts
operating poorly maintained equipment; hence their
employability outside Russia is questionable. The third battalions of brigades and regiments serve as training centres and recruitment basis of contractual servicemen, and are unlikely to be
used in combat. Many such units conduct combatant-level training throughout the year, which means that they are not prepared
to function integrally as subunits.

Thus, the Western Military District is capable of fielding using
around 30 battalion tactical groups. Considering the size of the
area for which the district is responsible, ranging from Murmansk oblast in the north to Voronezh oblast in the south, that
number is not high. The Western strategic direction is divided
into six operational ‘directions’, each consisting of several tactical
‘directions’. A simple calculation shows that Russia has a limited
capability to operate in more than one operational direction for a
significant period, considering that units need to be rotated.

The Russian army’s personnel problems were clearly visible in
the Ukrainian conflict. Units that were deployed to the Ukrainian
border during the first major staging of forces were randomly
composed, and had limited combat capability. During the winter/spring season of 2014, Russia focused on speed, deterrence,

## Russia s regional military commands

By December 1, 2010, the number of military districts in Russia will be cut from six to four.
Unifed strategic commands will be set up on their basis

The Kaliningrad The Western Military District The Central Military District
special region (West Strategic Command) (Central Strategic Command)

The reduction of the number of military districts will not lead to cuts in the military with headquarters in Khabarovsk

and bluffing. The units fielded during the summer were better organised. However, the Ukrainian armed forces had, by then, survived the most difficult period, and Russia lacked the strength to
launch a large-scale ground operation against Ukraine. In 2014,
Russia’s operations against Ukraine were conducted at the limit of its military capacity since a majority of its combat-capable
manoeuvre units were tied down with this campaign.

In addition to contractual servicemen, Russia also lacks junior
specialists: tank and armoured vehicle commanders, drivers,
gunners, etc. This problem is especially acute in artillery forces.
Moreover, a large number of junior specialists are conscripts who
have had just a few months of practice at best. The lack of qualified personnel has a substantial effect on Russia’s combat capacity and this may be one of the reasons why Russia decided not to
move further into Ukraine.

The changed security environment and the economic and financial crisis are forcing Russia to make adjustments to its federal defence procurement programmes, which means that Russia
will fail to meet its 2020 rearmament target, as a number of programmes have been frozen or postponed. The influence of sanctions is also increasingly apparent in several specific areas of the
defence industry.

The last time the Western Military District managed to fulfil the

equipment. Obstacles appeared in 2014 when the first new batches of equipment were to be delivered to the military district. The
Armata, Kurganets and Bumerang-type armoured vehicles (as
well as Taifuns) that were extensively publicised in the Russian
media are still at the testing stage and have not yet been officially
included in the order of battle.

The reasons for Russia’s increasing efforts to conduct special operations using asymmetric means and attacks against critical
targets lie at least partly in the weakness of its conventional
forces. Tactical nuclear weapons have served a similar function
in Russian military doctrine in the last decade. The Russian
armed forces are best prepared for a local conflict against a small
country without any allies where there is little or no threat of
conflict escalation. Thus, wars similar to the one conducted in
Georgia in 2008 are most suitable for the Russian armed forces.

**Russia’s military planning towards Estonia**

Russia’s aim for the Western strategic direction is creating a blocfree security zone throughout continental Europe and curbing
the US military presence until its complete withdrawal of forces
from Europe. Estonia is not a priority for Russia’s military planning. Instead, its priority areas include Kaliningrad, the Kola
operational direction (the Arctic) and, since 2014, Ukraine. The
biggest threat of a military conflict in the Baltic countries arises
from the Kremlin’s misconceptions which may be based on its
distorted perception of threats from the Western strategic direction (including the Baltics). Also, Russia views Europe as a single
entity and takes it into consideration in relation to developments
in other regions. Thus, conflicts in Ukraine or the Arctic may spill
over to the Baltic States as well.

Although Estonia is not a military priority for Russia, use of
military force here cannot be ruled out. For instance, Russia may
use military force when its armed forces fail to respond adequately
to a NATO-Russia conflict in another region. By creating a conflict
in the Baltics, Russia would attempt to gain a stronger position for
talks following the armed conflict. In a situation of conflict Russia
will consider the Baltic Sea region as a single entity, and Moscow
will not respect any country’s neutrality should war erupt. The
Kremlin takes into account that NATO may also use infrastructure
in Finland and Sweden, and therefore is prepared to attack targets

the most difficult to protect, and as a source of constant threat to
Russia’s security. Russia estimates that NATO may deploy 1–2 corps
in the region should a war break out. Thus, Moscow has only two
positive scenarios: the Baltic nations leaving NATO, or NATO ceasing to exist. All other solutions would be inconclusive for Russia.

Russia’s military planning in the Baltic operational direction
is based on the assumption that when staging forces, it has
a temporal advantage over NATO. Moscow believes that it is
capable of conducting a limited military operation before any
effective response by NATO could be mounted. The goal of such
operations would not be to seize the entire territory of Estonia
or Latvia, but rather to impose control over some towns or areas
close to the border. This operation would be conducted by units
permanently stationed close to the Estonian and Latvian borders,
reinforced by units of the 1st Tank Army and the Central Military
District, and by tactical nuclear weapons as deterrence.

**_RUSSIAN BALTIC FLEET_**

**_What is it? The Russian Baltic Fleet is divided into two areas: the Bal-_**

_tiysk naval base (Kaliningrad oblast) and the Leningrad naval base (St_

_Petersburg and Kronstadt). The main resources of the Baltic Fleet are_

_located in the Baltiysk naval base. The Leningrad naval base has lost its_

_military significance, mainly performing tasks concerning logistics, sus-_

_tainment, and administration. The presence of the fleet there has remai-_

_ned mostly symbolic._

**_Why is it important? The Russian Baltic Fleet is relevant for Estonia’s_**

_security mainly due to its location. Should political tensions escalate,_

_Russia might use the Baltic Fleet to disrupting maritime traffic and hold_

_demonstrations of force off the Estonian coast. Even though this is an_

_unlikely scenario, Russia may attempt to use the Baltic Fleet to block_

_traffic to and from Estonia’s ports and cut off NATO convoys. According_

_to theoretical worst-case scenarios, the Baltic Fleet may be used in at-_

_tempts to seize Estonian ports, and conduct fire missions and limited_

_amphibious operations against Estonia._

_Although the Russian Baltic Fleet is a military force to be reckoned with,_

_it has a limited military capacity in terms of size, technology and geo-_

_graphy, and is not comparable to the forces of NATO and Scandinavian_

_countries located in the region._

operational direction. Seemingly insignificant steps are part of
a larger plan which is being implemented over time. The nature
of Russia’s actions becomes clearer when events are seen from
a long-term perspective. Judging from the sequence of events,
Russia has substantially strengthened its military contingent
on the Baltic operational direction (Estonia, Latvia), and has
increased the volume and complexity of its exercises in the
region. Among the most significant changes are the formation
of the 15th army aviation brigade in Ostrov (Pskov oblast)
and placement of SS-26 ‘Iskander’ tactical missiles (NATO
reporting name – Stone) to Luga. Several units of the 6th Army
have been relocated to the Narva tactical direction, and the
Sertolovo training centre to the north of St Petersburg is to
be transformed into a training centre for armoured forces. An
army aviation brigade and a reconnaissance or Special Forces
brigade may also be formed in the Baltic operational direction
in the coming years.

In addition to the increase in the number of troops in the Baltic
operational direction, new weapon systems placed in Kaliningrad
and near the Estonian-Latvian border also pose a threat to Estonia. With these weapons (Iskander, sea or air-based cruise missiles, etc.) Russia will be able to isolate Estonia from its allies and
attack critical targets preventing NATO support from being able
to reach Estonia. Russian military planning is paying increasing
attention to attacks against critical targets. In the Baltic countries,
such targets may include infrastructure that is linked to the reception or servicing of NATO reinforcement. However, the use of
tactical nuclear weapons against Estonian targets or NATO units
located here is highly unlikely.

factors from the perspective of Estonia’s security. Close
military cooperation between Russia and Belarus – recently
demonstrated by the joint exercise ‘Union Shield-2015’ in the
Pskov and Leningrad oblasts – has a direct effect on Estonia’s
security. The activity of the Baltic Fleet should also be closely
observed as Russia may use it to create long-term military
deterrence to the EU and NATO if political tensions escalate. It
is possible that, should the international situation deteriorate,
additional temporary troops will be placed in Kaliningrad.
However, despite Russia’s official rhetoric, the Baltic Fleet is
not a priority to the Russian Navy due to the stable security
situation in the region.

**Russia’s aggression in Ukraine**

The Kremlin’s narrative of Russia as a global (or at least regional)
superpower is a bizarre combination of Soviet nostalgia, yearning
for revenge, and historical mysticism based on Byzantine and
Orthodox heritage. If Russia did not control Ukraine – the heartland of Orthodox East Slavs – this concept would have no consistency or historical justification. Completely outdated in the 21st
century, such justification serves as the basis for Russia’s aggression against Ukraine and its annexation of Crimea.

Russian aggression poses a particular threat to the countries
over which Russia is trying to prevail in order to restore its position as a global authority. Russia’s foreign policy is based on
the notion that all parts of the former Soviet Union (e.g. the CIS)
belong to its sphere of influence. Thus, Russia considers itself a
political and military guarantor that is responsible for stability

any country from leaving this sphere. Since Russia is acutely
aware of its weakness compared to the West, Moscow interprets
Western integration as interference in its sphere of influence,
and uses political, economic and military means to obstruct
that. To this effect, Russia has cultivated ‘frozen conflicts’ and
supported separatist regions in countries within its sphere of
interest, including Transnistria in Moldova, Nagorno-Karabakh
in Azerbaijan, and Abkhazia and South Ossetia in Georgia). Russia uses frozen conflicts as an instrument to prevent Western
integration of countries in its ‘near abroad’, allowing Russia to
portray itself as a peacemaker.

As Russia could not remain a convincing regional force without
having control over Ukraine, Ukraine’s turn to the West after
the toppling of Viktor Yanukovych was crossing a red line as
Moscow saw it. The aggression in Ukraine began with a special
operation in Crimea. Units of Russia’s Black Sea Fleet stationed
in Crimea supported the seizure of Crimean infrastructure and
military installations by unmarked Russian Special Forces. The
annexation of Crimea was carried out smoothly because the
operation was prepared, rehearsed, and executed according to
well-laid plans. Russian Special Forces were also involved at
the launch of the Donbass operation, but there Moscow decided
to rely on the assumed prevailing pro-Russian support among
the population of eastern Ukraine. Resulting from Russia’s
miscalculation of local pro-Russian activism and support, and
Ukraine’s delayed but steadily increasing response, the military
conflict was confined to a small section in the oblasts of Donetsk
and Luhansk.

Weak local support created a need for a much greater contribution
from Russia to keep the conflict going. This included equipping
separatists with arms, ammunition, equipment and most of all,
troops. Russia intervened in the conflict using both cross-border
indirect fire as well as deploying units of Russian regular armed
forces in the territory of Ukraine. Russia declared the need for
a peaceful resolution of the conflict, but meanwhile Moscow
contributed to the continuation of the conflict by supplying the
separatists with hundreds of tanks, armoured personnel carriers, combat vehicles, artillery systems, and thousands of tonnes
of ammunition, as well as training thousands of volunteers and
regular troops and deploying them to the conflict zone. Russia
has also applied political and economic pressure on Ukraine

aggression could have been avoided or reduced. Not expecting
such aggression from Russia and not having a plan to contain it,
Ukraine was paralysed when the conflict erupted. The planning
and execution of defence measures, including the involvement
of volunteers, was obstructed by bureaucracy, and there was
a lack of political will to react decisively as the Ukrainians
were hoping for a peaceful resolution to the conflict. The
uncontrollable corruption prevailing in the country worsened
the situation even further. As in Russia, political power was
used to gain economic benefits for particular interest groups.
This, in turn, further increased concentration into clans and
deepened Ukraine’s economic dependence on Russia.

Other negative factors in terms of Ukraine’s military planning
and armed forces included a chronic lack of funding and
questionable reforms introduced during Yanukovych’s rule. The
intelligence services also had unrestricted and uncontrollable
cooperation with the Russian services, allowing the latter
almost limitless infiltration into the Ukrainian establishment,
including recruitment of collaborators. For Russia, the situation
was facilitated due to the lack of efficient border guards and
control at the Russian-Ukrainian border, and existence of
Russian military bases in Crimea. It should also be noted that
Ukraine is divided according to language into Ukrainian and
Russian-speaking segments, resulting in the population falling
into different information spaces. Similarly, the attitudes and
language of troops depended on the location of units.

Ukraine’s position remains vulnerable, politically, economically
and militarily. In 2016, Russia will continue to destabilise
Ukraine, using the unresolved conflict in Donbass to further
this aim. Russia’s goals in Ukraine will remain the same: to
impede Ukraine’s integration to the West, and to apply pressure

manipulate Ukraine’s decision-making process via regions

resolution to the situation, it will remain a frozen conflict.

Although Russia’s military actions in Ukraine have a significant

and democratic society and rule of law are equally important. For
that reason, Russia is not able to threaten Estonia as a member of
NATO and the EU as it threatens Ukraine.

**Domestic policy**

Putin’s regime lacks the ideas and willingness to modernise Russia: there is no long-term development strategy and the predominant attitude among the ruling elite is ‘let’s rule until we die’. Visionaries and influential ideologists have mostly been replaced by
obedient and corrupt followers in Putin’s bureaucracy apparatus,
including the Presidential Administration and the government.
People at lower levels of the hierarchy are afraid of reporting problems or passing on information and assessments that are in conflict with the leader’s vision. This has created a situation where the
leadership is making decisions (also in the fields of foreign and
security policy) based on incorrect assumptions. Such a pattern of
behaviour is characteristic of all levels of Russia’s state apparatus.

Corruption has become the norm among Russian leaders, and
both the administration and businessmen associated with the
Kremlin see the state mostly as an instrument for gaining personal wealth. For instance, it was propably thanks to his closeness with President Putin that the well-known Russian businessman Arkadi Rotenberg was appointed in charge of an electronic
system for taxation of heavy-duty vehicles; running it will earn
him roughly €70–80 million per year.

ident Putin is trying to convince the people that the difficulties
they are experiencing are temporary and should simply be endured. The leadership wishes to consolidate society behind antagonism towards the West, a desire to restore the country’s Soviet-era
might, and the creation of an image of a foreign enemy. Thus, the
Kremlin is seeking support for its world view from the Soviet-era
state system, implementing that era’s principles both in terms of
party policy and ethnic policy. Symbols from the Soviet era are
used, particularly with the aim of influencing the youth.

Consolidation of the population by way of antagonism to the
West – of having a joint foreign enemy and being surrounded by
threats – is essential for the authorities in ensuring their success in the 2016 parliamentary elections. The ongoing economic
depression and the upcoming parliamentary elections have made
the Russian leadership conclude that 2016 will be difficult. An
improvement in the situation is expected in about two years,
provided that Western sanctions are lifted at least partially, and
that oil prices start to increase. In light of the 2018 presidential
elections, the Kremlin’s intention is to get complete control over
the media, including the most prominent writers in social media.

There is no free press in Russia. Media outlets are controlled by
businessmen loyal to the Kremlin, and TV is completely controlled
by the authorities. The Presidential Administration provides editors-in-chief with instructions weekly, detailing topics and key
phrases that must be covered during the week. Most of the radio
and print media is controlled by the authorities. The internet is the
least controlled, but the Kremlin is taking gradual steps to influence that as well. For a long time, the Kremlin ignored the internet
(Runet) and developments therein, but major changes were introduced in 2015 when two legislative amendments began regulating
business activity on the internet and granting the authorities more
ways to influence the activities of internet companies. The law allows websites that distribute pirated software to be closed down,
and forces internet companies to keep users’ personal data. For several years, the Kremlin has been using paid commentators (trolls)
for influencing social media. In 2014, the State Duma approved a law
demanding bloggers whose websites have more than 3,000 viewers
to register themselves, thus equating popular bloggers with media
outlets and thus making them subject to all the accompanying requirements and liabilities. This allows the authorities to gain control over potentially popular emergent opinion formers who share

frontation at the grassroots level, to prevent any possibility of
a ‘Maidan’ in Russia. The Ukrainian coup magnified the Kremlin’s fears that if developments in society cannot be directed and
controlled, then Kiev’s fate will be repeated in Moscow. A fear of
social unrest that can result in a coup is a definitive factor in the
behaviour of Putin and his administration, and this fear is magnified by the Russian leader’s paranoid conviction that the US is
doing everything it can to overthrow him.

Excluding the pseudo opposition created by the Kremlin (including the Liberal Democratic Party led by Vladimir Zhirinovsky,
and the ‘A Just Russia’ party, both of which have helped the
Kremlin channel people’s dissatisfaction), there is no organised
opposition in Russia. The absence of free media and any freedom of expression along with controlled domestic politics have
led people to express their opinions covertly on the internet, not
on the streets. For that reason, it is difficult for a functioning opposition to gain ground. Russia does have a multitude of political
parties and movements, but each has its own goals. Divides in
the opposition were further escalated by the society’s extensive
support to the annexation of Crimea.

Although the leadership takes substantial steps to quell opposition and prevent unrest, Putin’s circle has not managed to find
solutions to the problems concerning Chechnya and the North
Caucasus. Moscow is attempting to alleviate the simmering social
tensions in those regions by funding the ruling elites (clans) of
the North Caucasus republics, and deploying internal troops who
commit acts of violence which is mostly focused on Dagestan.

In Chechnya, the Kremlin saw a solution in Ramzan Kadyrov,
who was expected to take complete control of the region. Failing
to achieve this task, Kadyrov has irritated the Russian security
authorities with his behaviour; he apparently felt that the North
Caucasus had become too narrow for him, and is aiming to become
a politician with pan-Russian reach. Fearing unrest and lacking a
better alternative, Moscow has not removed him from power yet.

**Economy**

Russia is witnessing an economic crisis, the main reasons for
which are dependence on exports of raw materials, endemic and
thriving corruption, and slow progression of economic reforms.

control it. This has resulted in a massive outflow of capital and a drop
in investment in the economy. However, merely lifting sanctions
and a higher oil price will not help Russia emerge from the crisis;
economic revival requires extensive economic reform, but Moscow
lacks the political will to carry out these reforms and thus mitigate
the risks of a mono-product economy. Economic reforms could also
be accompanied by a rise in domestic discontent which would be
in direct contradiction of the image that Putin is trying to portray:
Russia as an economically powerful and independent country.

Economic recession and the loss of oil and gas revenue has put
Russia’s federal and regional budgets[2] under great pressure. Since
Western financial markets are closed to Russia, Moscow has
started using reserves gathered during the period of high oil
prices to cover the federal budget deficit. However, calculations
by the Russian Ministry of Finance show that, should the current
budget policy and oil price levels persist, the government reserve
fund will be depleted in two years. From 2018, the budget deficit
will mostly be covered by the domestic bonds market.

The rapid drop of the rouble has resulted in higher inflation, having a negative effect on real incomes and domestic demand. Russia’s projected economic recession was 4% in 2015, and there is no
sign of growth in 2016, because restoration of investment capacity and an increase in real incomes is not expected. After the monetary crisis in early 2015, the Russian central bank managed to
stabilise the situation on the Russian money market by massive
interventions and loans from leading commercial banks. Even
though the floating rate policy has helped the central bank to
avoid currency reserves falling below the minimum levels, and
the Russian financial environment has mostly adjusted to the
situation, this has not brought an increase in exports. The rouble’s
exchange rate against leading currencies is greatly influenced by
the price of oil and remains subject to heavy fluctuations. This, in
turn, keeps the inflation rate high and restricts investor activity.
The central bank’s foreign currency reserves have dropped from

Russia’s view, Sevastopol). The term ‘region’ is used as a synonym for ‘federal

$386 billion to $364 billion during 2015, although this is enough
for it to respond to larger market fluctuations.

The declining revenue from the export of oil, natural gas and
other natural resources will put increasing pressure on the
Russian economy in the long term. This will sharply increase
the need for reforms aimed at enhancing Russia’s economic
competitiveness. Also, the deteriorating demographic situation
creates a necessity for rapid reforms in the social system, which
is becoming the main source of the chronic budget deficit. The
main demographic trends – a decrease in the working-age
population and increase in the number and proportion of senior
citizens – are expected to continue over the next decade. While
people aged 20–59 made up 60% of the Russian population in
2015, this figure is expected to drop to 52% by 2025. The share
of people aged 60 and older is expected to grow over the same
period from 20% to 24%.[3] The total population of Russia is
projected to decrease by more than two million, but in the
working-age segment (20-59 years) the decline will be more
dramatic: roughly 12-13 million people. This trend is problematic
since the decrease in the working-age population facilitates
immigration. Already, both legal and illegal immigrants make
up a substantial share of the labour market, and Central Asian
countries are likely to remain a source of immigration for
Russia, which will bring about an increase in the proportion of
people with Muslim origins in the population.

contribute to its geopolitical ambitions by increasing the country’s military spending. Although from a long-term economic
perspective, Russia should be increasing spending on education,
innovation and healthcare, the 2016 federal budget demonstrates
an entirely opposite trend; allocations to healthcare will drop by
10.7% and to education by 8%. Instead of economic development
and raising the population’s standard of living, Russia has chosen
the path of increasing its military might. By contrast, Russia’s
defence spending in 2015 was at least 4.2% of the GDP.

The recent years have witnessed escalation of budget deficits
of regions along with the accompanying debt. A larger increase
started in 2013 when the revenue of most regions dropped, but
expenditure remained largely the same. In many respects, this
situation has been caused by the central government’s policy,
forcing regions to increase spending despite shrinking revenues.
At the beginning of Putin’s latest presidential term, he approved
a set of decrees that promised a pay rise in the public sector and
an increase in social spending. These decrees caused a significant
rise in the regions’ expenditure while at the same time federal
funding to regions started to decline from 2012. By the beginning
of 2015, Russia’s regions had a total debt of 2.09 trillion, and the
combined debt of regions and local governments was 2.4 trillion[4];

1.1 trillion of the debt amounts to banks.

**Energy security**

Russia is using traditional economic instruments to achieve its
foreign policy objectives, trying to increase its leverage in the
CIS area and use EU member states to serve its federal interests.
Moscow continued to actively follow this policy line after the
onset of the crisis in Ukraine, hoping EU sanctions would be lifted;
but the ‘reorientation of economic cooperation to the East’ that
was enthusiastically announced by the Kremlin has not taken
effect. The EU continues to be the main target market for Russia’s
raw materials, and thus Moscow continues its efforts to execute
Gazprom’s projects with a view to increasing natural gas exports
to Europe.

Based on political considerations and the benefits of a few
interest groups, the freshly launched pipeline project Nord

Stream-2 is yet another example of Russia’s manipulations of
Europe’s energy needs.

Using Nord Stream-2, Moscow is also trying to fuel conflict
within the EU and reduce the volume of natural gas passing
through Ukraine. Hence, it is no coincidence that the deadline
of the pipeline coincides with the expiry of the Ukraine-Russia
gas deals in 2019. A realignment of the gas transit route will
make Central and Eastern Europe more susceptible to Russia’s
manipulations concerning energy, as the new gas route will
reduce the amount of gas reaching those areas. However, it is
not very likely that Russia will use Nord Stream-2 to cut Ukraine
off from natural gas transit altogether; Russia needs that route
for supplying gas to Transnistria at the very least. However, a
continuous decline in the volume of natural gas passing through
Ukraine, accompanied by the loss of revenue from gas transit,

from his closest circle in the development of this project, too.
For instance, the executive director of both Nord Stream-1 and
Nord Stream-2 is Matthias Warnig, Putin’s longstanding friend
and confidant. Their friendship began in Germany in 1980 when
the former worked for the Stasi and the latter for the KGB. Their
friendship strengthened in 1993 when Warnig arranged medical
care in Germany for Putin’s wife Lyudmila, who had suffered
a serious accident. Putin is said to have not forgotten the favour, and has repaid Warning generously. Warnig’s career took
off during Putin’s first term, and he has become a member of
the board of directors of several strategic Russian companies
including Rusal, Rosneft, Transneft, and VTB Bank.

Russia’s state nuclear energy company Rosatom’s cooperation
projects abroad also play a key role in achieving Russia’s foreign
policy objectives. The Kremlin knows that there is little chance
of sanctions being imposed in the nuclear energy sector as several EU member states and other Western nations have close ties
with the Russian nuclear energy sector, including operation of
nuclear power plants, supplies of nuclear fuel, and the Uranium
trade. Thus, nuclear energy provides Moscow with an alternative
to achieving its foreign policy goals. For instance, commissioning
a nuclear power plant will tie the contracting entity to Rosatom
for nearly 80 years. Rosatom has announced a goal of operating
30 international nuclear power plants by 2030.

Bakr al-Baghdadi on 8 April 2013 when he published a 21-minute
audio message announcing a merger between AQI and Jabhat alNusra (JaN), and the formation of a new group, ISIL. However,
JaN’s leader Abu Muhammad al-Julani (also known as al-Golani)
announced a few days later in an audio message posted on
radical Islamist websites that JaN had pledged allegiance to alQaeda’s leader Ayman al-Zawahiri, instead. Al-Julani also denied
any allegations that JaN had joined AQI.

JaN was established by AQI, but with Syria’s rise to be the main
jihadist battleground, the group’s importance and self-image
had also expanded. The organisation gained much attention
from al-Qaeda, including the arrival of al-Qaeda leaders in
Syria. Therefore, Al-Baghdadi made the announcement of two
organisations merging in order to avoid JaN being ‘hijacked’ by
al-Qaeda. However, the idea of being directly affiliated with alQaeda was more appealing to JaN’s leaders.

Al-Qaeda’s leader al-Zawahiri also made a statement concerning
the status of JaN in 2013, claiming that JaN is not a member
of Daesh and is a sister organisation of al-Qaeda. Al-Zawahiri
ordered ISIL to disband and return to Iraq; in other words, to
return to being AQI. ISIL rejected this order and announced that
it would not compromise and surrender. Despite disagreements
at the top level, combatants of JaN and Daesh continued
cooperation in Syria at the local level.

At the same time, other Islamist groupings fighting Bashar
al-Assad’s regime claimed that Daesh was more interested in
establishing a caliphate in northern Syria than fighting against
al-Assad’s regime. In the second half of 2013, Daesh began
enforcing Sharia law in Raqqa and Azaz, cities it controlled at
that time. By November 2013, tensions between Daesh and
other groups fighting al-Assad’s regime had evolved into open
hostilities.

In June 2014, Daesh, in cooperation with local Sunni tribes
and former officers of Saddam Hussein’s army, launched
an offensive in Iraq, gaining control of significant parts of

of foreign fighters in its propaganda to efficiently spread its
message across the world. This is facilitated by the fact that Daesh
has managed to seize large areas of Iraq and Syria, the very region
that was the core of the caliphate that existed in between the 7th
and 13th centuries. Having partial control of the core territory of
the former caliphate is one of the main aspects that makes Daesh
so appealing to radical Islamists. Throughout its existence, alQaeda managed to organise a series of large-scale terror attacks,
but these do not outweigh restoring to historical caliphate.

**How does declaration of a caliphate affect global jihadism?**

There has been an ongoing power struggle between al-Qaeda and
Daesh for the title of the leader of the global jihadist movement
for the past two years. On February 2014, al-Qaeda’s official media
organisation As-Sahab made a statement claiming that al-Qaeda
is not affiliated with Daesh since al-Qaeda had been neither informed nor consulted on the establishment of this organisation.
According to the statement al-Qaeda was dissatisfied with the
creation of Daesh and ordered it to dissolve, and emphasised that
al-Qaeda was not responsible for Daesh’s actions.

Daesh declared an Islamic caliphate on June 2014 and called
upon all Middle-Eastern jihadist organisations to pledge
allegiance to this Islamic State. Declaration of a caliphate has
raised a dilemma for Middle-Eastern jihadist organisations,
and also for al-Qaeda’s sister organisations: should they pledge
allegiance to Daesh, or continue to recognise al-Qaeda as the
leader of the global jihadist movement? Thus far, al-Qaeda’s
sister organisations have remained loyal to al-Qaeda. At the
same time, Daesh’s military achievements in Iraq and Syria as
well as its vision of a universal Islamic State are appealing to
a great number of followers of the global jihadi ideology. This
poses a serious challenge to al-Qaeda’s leading role in the global
jihadist movement. Neither can we rule out the possibility that
al-Qaeda and Daesh will try to outdo each other in organising
terror attacks in order to win over more jihadists.

countries where there have been no problems with Islamist
extremism in the past. Supporters of global jihadism are
used for recruiting new combatants or inspiring them to act
as ‘lone wolves’[7 ]in spreading terror in their home countries.
Daesh is increasingly attempting to establish contact with a
younger generation of radicals who are unknown to European

influence activity. The situation is aggravated by the fact that
the radicalisation process of voluntary combatants from Europe
is becoming increasingly shorter, and radicalising networks are

_of 129 people were killed and 352 wounded in the attacks. This was the_

_largest attack in Europe coordinated and prepared by Daesh’s network._

_For the first time, suicide belts were used in addition to arms._

**_Why is it important? More dedicated to conducting foreign and_**

_information operations than before, Daesh called upon its fighters in a_

_statement made on 14 November 2015 to continue attacks on members_

_of the coalition fighting against Daesh. Daesh has changed its tactics:_

_instead of inviting combatants to Syria, it is sending foreign fighters_

_who have a war experience from Syria back to Europe to organise_

_attacks there. In earlier terror attacks in 2015, mainly lone wolves with_

_no experience from the Syrian war were used as attackers. The Paris_

_attacks showed that the jihadists who executed the operation (led from_

_Syria) were European citizens who belonged to an organised network,_

_and returned to Europe from Syria using false identities. Daesh’s goal_

_was to demonstrate its operational capacity in Europe in order to_

7 A so-called lone wolf is a person who has not received any direct training

or an order to commit an attack from a terrorist organisation. They act on

appeals of terrorist organisations to commit terror attacks in a given country

or against a specific target. Lone wolves are typically individually radicalised

people who are unknown to the security services, making them very difficult

effective recruitment. Each member of Daesh can be a potential
recruiter: they can develop their own propaganda networks
and spread their message on social media, describing consistent
military success against the West and glorifying life in the
caliphate.

The profile of Europeans heading to Syria is varied. They are not
only people who are miserable, uneducated Muslims who suffer
from poverty or integration problems. They include both married
and single people with varying levels of education, people with
military combat experience, and convicted criminals. There
are under-aged combatants, young women, and retired people.
Radicalisation is usually not caused by a belief in Islam (in reality,
they do not focus on studying or understanding Islam) but rather
problems in one’s personal life, personal contacts, a wish to start
a new life full of adventure, or a yearning to experience war,
execute a terror attack, or die as a martyr.

Nearly 30,000 voluntary foreign fighters from across the world
have headed to Syria to participate in the military conflict
there. At least 6,500 are from Europe, mostly from France, the
UK, Germany, and Belgium, but with increasing numbers from
northern Europe. Most European volunteers have joined Daesh.
The relative geographic proximity of Syria and Iraq also plays
an important role in the multitude of foreign fighters. However,
although the number of fighters heading to Syria from Europe is
still increasing, the rate of growth has fallen in comparison to
2014.

Thus far there is no evidence of resolution to armed conflicts in
the Middle East and Africa which facilitate the spread of religious
extremism across the world, including to Europe. Therefore, extremists return to Europe and Daesh’s large-scale and effective
influence operations against the West – instigating lone wolves –
continue to pose a serious threat to European security.

In the article ‘From the battles of Al-Ahzāb to the war of
coalitions’ in the 11th issue of Daesh’s magazine _Dabiq, Daesh_
calls on fighters to attacks the coalition partners of operation
‘Inherent Resolve’ and their supporters. For the first time, the
targets mentioned include Estonia. It should be noted that

whatever means possible. However, it can still be concluded
that international terrorism is currently not a serious threat
to Estonia, but it is a high risk for Estonian citizens abroad.
The greatest threat to Estonia in relation to Islamic terrorism
arises from radicalisation of Muslim communities in the
neighbouring countries and EU citizens participating in armed
conflicts outside the European Union, mainly in Syria and Iraq.

# Conflict in Syria

The civil war in Syria began in 2011 with unrest inspired by
the so-called Arab Spring protests that had erupted in Tunisia,
Egypt and Libya. The ruling al-Assad family in Syria (headed by
Bashar al-Assad who became president after the death of his father Hafez al-Assad in 2000) responded to the public’s demands
for reforms with repressions that resulted in the civil war.

At the beginning of 2012, al-Qaeda’s leader Ayman Al-Zawahiri
called on its members in Iraq, Jordan, Lebanon and Turkey to
join against al-Assad’s regime and organise terror attacks. In
reality, large numbers of foreign fighters were already flowing
into Syria by the time of al-Zawahiri’s appeal. By the summer
of 2012 it was clear that al-Assad’s regime was not capable
of independently restoring control over the entire country,
but neither was he threatened with immediate collapse. This
resulted in stalemate. Even though armed opposition fighting
against al-Assad’s regime was increasing in terms of both human
resources and technical capacity, it remained fragmented.
Consequently, armed opposition units began to act increasingly
as regional militia groups, which further aggravated the
chaos in the country. The origins of the negative trends in
the country include deterioration of the economy, increased
ethnic tensions between the Alawites (Shiites) and Sunnites,
increased presence of forces promoting global jihadism, and
religious radicalisation of oppositional forces.

By the end of 2012, al-Assad’s regime in Syria acted not as a
government standing against insurgents but as a well-armed
protagonist fighting in a civil war. This resulted in ever more
violent battles since al-Assad’s regime became less interested in
the opinion of and pressure from the international community.
At the same time, the international community became greatly
concerned over the growing role of jihadists and their position
in fighting against al-Assad’s regime. The number of European

in Syria had become the most appealing destination for jihadists
around the world.

As combat activity intensified in the suburbs of Damascus,
al-Assad’s regime used chemical weapons there in the early
morning of 21 August 2013. Consequently, Syria was put under
great international pressure. This resulted in an unexpected
turn in the politics of al-Assad’s administration: the existence
of chemical weapon was officially admitted for the first time
on 9 September 2013. Hoping to forestall US military strikes,

_Russia’s military support to Syrian government forces is not sufficient_

_Russians will remain in Syria even if al-Assad should be ousted._

_Russia’s military presence in Syria is expected to grow in the coming_

the Syrian government agreed to place its chemical weapons
under international control. The Syrian minister of foreign
affairs Walid al-Muallem announced the following day that
Syria has agreed to disclose the locations of their chemical
weapons storage sites, to stop producing chemical weapons,
and to allow representatives of Russia, other countries, and
the UN to access the facilities linked to chemical weapons. AlMuallem also confirmed that Syria would join the international
chemical weapons convention. In late September 2013, the
Syrian government officially declared the chemical weapons
the regime possessed and commenced international cooperation
for destruction thereof.

The chemical weapons destruction treaty signed with alAssad pushed several armed groups away from the secular
opposition and created a belief that there will never be
a Western military intervention in the Syrian civil war.
Therefore, at the end of 2013 Jaysh al-Islam[8] and five
other major local Islamist (but not jihadist) armed groups,[9]

with a total of 45,000 combatants, announced merging to form
the Islamic Front. Another factor contributing to the formation
of this group was ISIL’s rise in Syria, which escalated tensions
between the secular and Islamist opposition, but also between
Arabs and Kurds, and even between JaN and ISIL.

8 In September 2013, 43 armed Islamist (but not jihadist) groupings operating in

Damascus area pledged allegiance to Liwa al-Islam’s commander Muhammad

Zahran Ibn Abdallah Alloush. Named Jaysh al-Islam, the new grouping had

30,000–40,000 combatants.

auspices in Montreux (Switzerland) at the beginning of 2014.
Although both the Syrian regime and the exiled political
opposition were represented at the peace conference, most of
the armed oppositional groupings did not participate and failed
to acknowledge Geneva II. It was clear from the start of the
conference that a breakthrough would not be achieved, and the
stalemate persisted in Syria throughout the second half of 2014
and into 2015. Russian air raids that began on 30 September 2015
also failed to bring a decisive breakthrough for the al-Assad
regime. The Syrian conflict has a global impact, influencing
not only Syria’s neighbours but also other countries, including
those in Europe. The security of these nations is threatened by
extremists who have brought along terrorism and violence to
their home countries after returning from fighting in Syria.
Jordan, Lebanon and Israel are at the greatest risk of the conflict
spilling over onto their territory, and these countries have
faced to varying extents the consequences of the Syrian civil
war: humanitarian crisis, mass movement of refugees, crossborder armed incidents, and extremist activity. Naturally, the
Syrian conflict has a direct effect on the fight against Daesh
in Iraq. There is little possibility of a diplomatic breakthrough
in Syria in 2016. Even assuming that an unlikely agreement to
form a joint position for negotiations can be reached between
all the forces opposing and fighting al-Assad’s regime, there are
still many obstacles to the Syrian peace process. There is no
consensus on Bashar al-Assad’s role in the peace process. It is
difficult to believe that Russia and Iran would stop supporting
the current regime even if an agreement was reached on alAssad’s replacement. Moreover, the political parties and armed
groups in Syria have diametrically opposing views on the future
of Syria.[10] For example, Ahrar al-Sham, one of the largest and
most influential groups within the armed opposition fighting
against al-Assad, works in cooperation with JaN, al-Qaeda’s
branch in Syria. However, if major armed opposition groups
such as Ahrar al-Sham or Jaysh al-Islam are left out of the peace
plan, the plan could not be successfully implemented.

10 There are numerous armed groups with various aims operating in Syria.

Group sizes range from 100–200 people to thousands of members. Some of

these groups are linked to a certain geographic area. The ideologies of these

# Libya

The greatest terror threat from Africa comes from Libya, which
is becoming the next largest Daesh stronghold in the world
behind Iraq and Syria. After Libya’s leader Colonel Muammar
al-Gaddafi was toppled in 2011 after 42 years of rule, the country
plunged into a civil war which fragmented Libya between several
conflicting parties supported by various armed groupings.
The so-called liberal government in Tobruk was supported by
the Libyan National Army led by General Khalifa Haftar and
militias from Zintan, and the Libya Dawn coalition (the so-called
Islamists) controlled Tripoli and was mostly supported by units
from Misrata. Since early 2015, violence has escalated in Libya,
and Daesh has used this situation to its advantage. According to
a UN report on 1 December 2015, Daesh has gained substantial
weight in Libya and if the rival governments fail to reach an
agreement on governing the state,[11] it may expand its territory
in Libya even further. The report states that of all Daesh’s
branches or provinces, [12] Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi controls the
Libyan branch the most and sees this region as having the most
potential for expanding the caliphate. Daesh is already calling
for people on social media to travel to Libya instead of Iraq and
Syria. This may bring an increase of African jihadists in Libya.
For now, Daesh may have up to 3,000 fighters in Libya, most
of whom are from Tunisia and Morocco. Daesh has complete
control over Sirte and its surrounding area, and has a smaller
presence in Sabratha, Tripoli, Sabha, Benghazi, and Derna.

11 The UN has attempted to invite the conflict participants to agree to and end

the fighting from the beginning of 2015. Finally, a unity government deal was

signed on 18 December 2015. However, the deal has been rejected by speakers

of the legislative bodies of both Tobruk and Tripoli. Moreover, the main armed

groups in the county did not participate in the talks. Thus, this deal is not as

significant as the media has presented it since the main objective – achieving

stability in Libya – is not realistically attainable.

12 Daesh has so-called provinces in Iraq and Syria, Libya, Egypt, Algeria, Nigeria,

For Daesh, Libya will remain a key location from which it
can spread to neighbouring countries and to elsewhere in
Africa. Libyan training camps present an extensive threat to
the governments and tourism sectors of the neighbouring
countries. This has been especially evident in Tunisia and Egypt
where terrorists returning from Libyan training camps have
committed several attacks. Tunisia is also the largest source
of jihadists fighting in Iraq and Syria – up to 6,000 people,
according to various sources.

If Libya is to become the preferred jihadist battleground, and
jihadists will find it more difficult to travel to Iraq or Syria,
Libya may into a larger destination for jihadist fighters. Also,
combatants returning from Iraq and Syria may be heading to
Libya next. Thus, if Daesh succeeds in making Libya its next
major stronghold, attempts to attack Europe via Libya cannot be
ruled out.

# Migration crisis

Escalation of tensions in international conflict zones is a potential source of instability for Estonia and the whole of Europe.
Failed states suffering from lawlessness are the main causes of
the migration crisis. According to a UN assessment, 80% of the
people who have reached Europe through the Balkans are fleeing
conflict in Syria, Afghanistan or Iraq.

A massive increase of migrants heading to Europe in 2015 has
resulted in escalated economic, social and political pressure, and
security threats in EU member states. This holds true for both
southern European countries at the frontline of the influx of
migrants, as well as for northern Europe, which is an increasingly popular destination for migrants. European countries have a
limited capacity and appetite to receive the increasing number of
migrants, and more and more refugees are using illegal methods
for entering the European Union. The number of people who have
tried to enter the EU using false identification or have presented
false information about their nationality also increased markedly in 2015. As the migratory movement intensifies, identification
of people and checking identity requires more time and more
resources.

mism, international crime, and terrorism. Globalisation has magnified these effects even further. As the number of unidentified
people illegally entering the EU rises, this serves as a basis for
illegal activity that supports intertwined networks of terrorism,
international crime, and illegal immigration, as well as for extremists infiltrating European countries. Other threats include the
increasing number of people who have had contact with, or have
been influenced by, members of terrorist organisations fighting
in Syria, and the rising number of radicalised people in these target countries.

Since the security situation in the migrants’ native countries
remains difficult, this migratory movement towards the EU is
expected to continue. In the context of the migration crisis, several
EU member states have seen a surge in the popularity of far-right
movements and political parties displaying hostility towards the
EU. This rise of nationalism and intolerance may result in growing
tensions, disorder, and civil disturbances in member states, and
the spread of extremist views escalates conflicts within the EU,
aggravating domestic tensions in member states and causing
conflicts between them. This will undermine the integrity of the
European Union as a whole. The spread of extremist views and
escalation of tension is skilfully used by Russia in pursuing its
foreign policy goals by attempting to fuel conflicts within the EU
by, for example, supporting European far-right extremists.

# Cyber threats

The rapid global development of information technology, including developed countries choosing IT solutions which provide
greater efficiency, comes at the price of increased cyber threats
to the security of these countries. Being little regulated in legal terms, the quickly developing cyberspace provides multiple
levels of threats to countries since the direct targets of attacks
may include both individuals and states. Nations find it difficult
to provide their citizens with active protection in the cyberspace, since this would be accompanied by privacy restrictions.
It is also difficult to identify the perpetrators of cyber-attacks
– whether a country or an individual – and therefore adequate
response to such attacks is also challenging. The lines between
cyber activists, criminals and state-paid hackers are becoming
increasingly blurred.

Security threats arising from cyber-attacks can be divided into
three broad categories: attacks against the 1) confidentiality; 2)
availability; and 3) integrity of information. The first category
is usually associated with economic and diplomatic espionage.
Countries systematically collect information, and an opportunity
to use information that has been obtained via criminals or
activists will not be passed up. This category also includes statefunded groups that use complex malware such as APT29, a cyber
intelligence group linked to the Russian government. The second
category includes attempts to disrupt the functioning of society
or an institution and to discredit them internationally. The
coordinated and massive denial-of-service attacks conducted
against Estonia in 2007 fall under this category. The third group
consists of cyber-attacks aimed at altering information in states’
systems, and using the resulting incorrect information for the
purposes of, for example, propaganda. In these cases, the goal
is to discredit and confuse the country domestically and on the
international arena.

phenomenon of state-coordinated cyber-attacks – has grown
rapidly in recent years. In cyberspace, Russia is the source of
the greatest threat to Estonia, the European Union and NATO.
Estonia is a target of hostile cyber acts both as an individual
country, and as a member of the EU and NATO. Russia is actively
adding to its cyber-attack capacity and has a wide range of
tools and resources necessary for carrying out attacks (denialof-service, malware, security vulnerabilities, etc.). According
to Russia’s information doctrine, the country is in a constant
information war with the West, and cyber activity is necessary
for introducing (read: enforcing) its geopolitical power, position
as a nation of authority, and its viewpoint. Following Edward
Snowden’s leaks, the paranoia that Russia is not in control of
its information space and other countries are constantly spying
on Russia using the internet is widespread among the Kremlin.
Russia is manipulating social media and the press, spreading
lies and its propaganda positions, and attempting to manipulate
public opinion. The lines between cyber activists, criminals
and state-paid hackers are becoming increasingly blurred, and
cyber criminals are collaborating with the intelligence services
of countries that are hostile to Estonia, which continues to be a
constant target of cyber-attacks, although the intensity of attacks
against Estonia is quite low.

Extranets of Estonian state authorities have been repeatedly ‘mapped’ and several test attacks were conducted against Estonia during 2015. The probable reason for mapping networks is to determine the resources necessary for future attacks. In other words,
the adversary wants to find out what resources are necessary and
in what volume for halting a vital service, or how that service is
set up and defended. In previous years, there have been repeated attempts to gain access to sensitive networks using e-mails
infected with malware (e.g. Ke3Chang and CosmicDuke attacks).

The term ‘hybrid war’ or warfare without declaring a war
emerged in the context of the military conflict in Ukraine. In
a future hybrid war, massive cyber-attacks and disruptions of
information infrastructure may start much earlier than the
actual military action. Disruptions of information and other vital
infrastructure will be used for creating dissatisfaction with the
government among certain segments of the population. This
dissatisfaction will then be used for legitimising emergence of
‘little green men’ or ‘militia groups’. Cyber activity and cyber

testing and assessment of the adversary’s capabilities. It is
relatively cheap and very effective to destabilise a country’s
political or economic environment using cyber attacks, and
thus it would be folly to assume that the IT solutions currently
available in Estonia are entirely safe. However, constant system
improvement, international cooperation, and educating end
users will help reduce the potential damage arising from hostile
cyber activity. New technologies, user convenience, cost-saving,
and international media coverage should not outweigh the
importance of avoiding risk to the Estonian people and state.
