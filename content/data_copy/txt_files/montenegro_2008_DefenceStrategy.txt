# 1. Security Environment Of Montenegro

## 1.1. Global And Regional Security

Today's challenges to security in the world are coming from different sources. They are mainly caused by social, cultural, religious, economic, scientific and technological differences and divisions in the world. 

In the spectrum of current security challenges, the emphasis can be put on the following: international terrorism, proliferation of weapons for mass destruction, pending border issues, religious and ethnic disputes, organised crime, natural and man-made disasters, economic and social problems and cyber crime. Asymmetric threats, such as terrorism, organised crime, ethnic and religious conflicts, and proliferation of weapons for mass destruction constantly change and develop and they are characterised by uncertainty, constant duration, unpredictability, disproportional nature, dynamic nature and low cost in relations to the effect. These threats have transnational character and no single country has a capability to face them alone, but they require global co-ordinated response. Processes of Euro-Atlantic and European integration are ongoing in the recent years in the region of South East Europe. All South East European countries are either integrated or in the phase of integration into NATO and EU. At international and regional level, several security co-operation initiatives are launched in order to establish long lasting peace and stability in the region. In military terms, reduction of armaments and military assets is being carried out. 

## 1.2. Challenges, Risks And Threats

As a consequence of reduction of military assets in the region, integration of the countries into NATO and EU and development of the policy of confidence, cooperation and partnership, **military threat** to Montenegro is significantly reduced; however, it cannot be excluded in the future. 

Global challenges, risks and threats are not primarily related to use of military force. Security of Montenegro can be negatively affected by crises in South East Europe, but instabilities in other regions cannot be neglected because of indirect effect. 

Identified modern challenges, risks and threats, in particular asymmetric threats can affect security of Montenegro. 

## 2. Defence Goals Of Montenegro

Defence goals derive from defined security interests and goals of Montenegro. Strategic defence goal of Montenegro is to develop integrated defence system, capable to defend and preserve independence, sovereignty and national territory.

In order to respond to present and future security challenges, risks and threats, it is necessary to develop wide range of defence and military capabilities. For the purpose of implementation of the strategic defence goal, Montenegro strives to implement the following defence goals: 1) Development of credible defence capabilities, 2) Development of interoperable capabilities of Montenegro for participation in peace support activities in the world, 3) Contribution in building up stable security environment, 4) Development of partnership and co-operation with other democratic countries, and 5) Development of required capabilities to join NATO and EU. 

## 3. Strategic Defence Concept Of Montenegro

Defence of Montenegro is focused on preservation of its national interests based on the principles of developed democracy, rule of law, market economy and orientation towards European and Euro-Atlantic integration.

Montenegro is determined to make active contribution in the processes of development of the international system of co-operative security and collective defence based on multilateral co-operation and confidence. Montenegro shares position of developed democratic countries that the most effective way to achieve favourable security environment is through a joint effort aimed at conflict prevention and stability building. 

Modern challenges to the security are of such nature that Montenegro cannot base its defence on its capabilities only. Strategic defence concept is based on development of integrated defence system, capable to adapt to the future changes and to join international defence and security integration. This is an optimum way to engage available defence resources. For that purpose, Montenegro implements the strategic defence concept in the following manner:
